That said, the second night we ate there, I asked for the salads only (delicious and bountiful), my husband had salads plus tangine, and we were only charged for one meal-- suddenly dinner became a bargain. We also asked the riad to clean two pairs of pants and a shirt-- which was done at no charge.

We ate dinner in the riad one evening, and Fatima, the award-winning chef, served an exquisite meal. I would give anything for her recipe for Honeyed Lamb Tagine, and her array of Moroccan salads was unusual and delicious. A stay we will cherish in memory for a very long time.');\n",

The staff, primarily two people, were ever so warm and friendly and took very good care of me! They served wonderful breakfasts, answered questions, shared something of their lives with me -- very special since I very much wanted to meet and get to know at least a few Moroccans and had found that traveling and being a tourist did not easily make this opportunity available.

We also stayed in Riad Kinza which is quite close but and found Aribe worth the extra cost. The restaurant has the most wonderful ambiance. Truly stunning.

In our stay we were only visitors in kasbah so we could fully appreciate hospitality and friendliness of our owner: he is not only kind and complaisant, also he is an interesting guide enthusiastic in his work and interesting to talk and to listen. For a reasonable price he showed a historical part of his hotel which is so nice to see and learn. Rooms were clean and authentic in a very sweet way. The food was VERY nice (the best breakfast and soup I\"ve ever had in Morocco). The place Skoura is silent and good for a bike trip. Totally recomend you to visit this pace.');\n",

Our room was large and comfortable with a nice seating area and a separate bedroom. Unfortunately, the seating area smelled like smoke much of the time as the guests next door puffed up a storm. The hotel\"s dining room has a huge and varied buffet; an excellent staff and delicious fresh picked and squeezed orange juice for breakfast. The various movie props and posters from films shot in the area add a fun note to this solid hotel.');\n",
