This Riad is well situated in the medina, a short distance from a parking area outside the medina walls, and a short distance to the heart of the medina, port, and ocean. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, providing directions and restaurant recommendations. The rooms were spacious, clean, very comfortable, and well appointed.

We arrived late at night and the staff couldn’t be more welcoming, even making my partner dinner as he was hungry!

The breakfasts were nice and well presented. All in all I would have no hesitation in recommending this as an excellent spot to stay.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2020,5,Attempted visit during coronavirus,This place went above and beyond in credits for us when we were stuck in Amsterdam after a ten hour flight and were pulled off boarding to Marrakesh with no notice. My email never sent in trying to cancel all hotels quickly and they fully credited. Very amazing process and customer service on their part.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2020,4,Lovely Friendly Riad,"Spent 4 nights in Essaouria in Riad Chbanate. Did a lot of research beforehand and this Riad had consistently great reviews. I had emailed the Riad a lot before handcand Hicham responded quicky and politely. We took a taxi from Marrakech witj Med Taxi at 50 euro each way, which was by far the cheapest out of all the taxi services. The Riad was at the furthest end of the Media, so a bit of a trek, but Essaouria is not a big place so for most people will be fine. There are only 6 rooms and we had the Hyatt Suite, which was lovely with a huge bathroom! The Riad is fully staffed with a friendly team, who look after you well. The only disappointing side for us was the breakfast, which is why i couldn't give it the 5* I so wanted to. There is a very limited, uninspiring menu…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2020,5,Wonderful staff!,"The staff were so welcoming and helpful throughout our stay and had plenty of tips on things to do and places to eat.

 March 2020,3,Nice bedroom but the terrace was a bit shabby,This Riad was quite nice but not s good as others we stayed in. The biggest let down was the terrace with was just a bit unloved with shabby towels. The same towels were set out both days for guests to use. This was easy to see as there were bleach marks and plucks. Two many cats hanging around for my liking.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2020,5,Amazing stay in Essaouira,"Loved Riad Chbanate! All of the staff were very friendly and helpful, and our room was beautiful. The fireplace at night was a very nice touch after coming in from a cool evening. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 December 2019,5,Incredible Stay in Essouira,"We had such an incredible stay at Riad Chbanate in Essaouira.

 November 2019,5,You must stay here!,"Riad Chbanate was our first stop after almost 24 hours of travel to Morocco. We were met outside of the old medina where a member of the staff helped us with our bags and show us the way. The moment we walked in, we knew our two nights would not feel like long enough. The riad was decorated beautifully, with many items from the medina. Greggi gave us a very thorough rundown of the medina with a map, highlighting some favorite spots and sharing some homemade bread, mint tea, and a Moroccan beer as we settled in. He showed us to our room, which was complete with a beautiful bathtub, fireplace, and moroccan furniture. We were very sad to leave, and Riad Chbanate was easily the favorite place we stayed. We cannot recommend this riad for your stay in Essaouira highly enough.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

The architecture is gorgeous, and the decor beautifully thought out. All together a beautiful experience. We will be back.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2019,5,The host with the most,"We stayed here for 3 night last week. During our time in Morocco we stayed at 7 different riads. Nowhere else did we receive the level of personal service we received here. In particular Greggi went above and beyond at any opportunity. He lit the fire in our room every night. He went out of his way to make us feel welcome and on one of the days I was feeling unwell he was extra attentive and thoughtful. The riad itself is very good. Nice rooms, massive bathroom, open fire in rooms, good food but the service is the best.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2019,5,Book it!,"Beautiful place with lovely staff. They recommended many things to do around the area and were always there to help. Also put us a beautiful room for our honeymoon. Of the 6 places we stayed in Morocco, this was the best!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2019,5,Wonderful in every sense...,"The staff are clearly the soul of this Riad, whose rooms are all exotically sumptuous and incredibly inviting to just lounge and relax after a day out on the town. Make sure you light the fireplace and enjoy the bath...",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 October 2019,5,Perfect blend of modern comforts with all the charm of a special Riad stay,"This was probably our favorite Riad out of the 5 we stayed at in Morrocco.

 October 2019,5,Beautiful Riad / Felt like home!,"I spent 3 nights at Riad Chbanate with my girlfriend in October 2019. We couldn’t have picked a better place to start our Morocco trip! The Riad is beautifully designed and conveniently located just inside the medina. The staff was so kind and gracious, they had terrific recommendations and helped us with everything from dinner reservations to finding a place to park our rental car. The complimentary breakfast is amazing and we had a private dinner on our last night! I 100% recommend staying here, we were sad to say goodbye.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 September 2019,5,Lovely stay,"Spent three nights Had a room that required 68 steps to climb The breakfast was more or less the same everyday. The Toilet had minor glitches The lighting a bit dim And yet Gregi and Naowl made us very comfortable. A beautiful Riad on the quieter side of the Walled city, very tastefully done up, but the human component of a smiling and welcoming greeting made up for everything. Helpful descriptions in getting around. The public car park is near by too Overall top class. Had a lovely candle lit, fire-place side dinner too. Highly recomended.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 August 2019,5,"Amazing place, even better staff!","We stayed at Riad Chbanate for 2 nights with our 1.5 yr old son and it was an amazing experience.

 July 2019,5,Brilliant Place to Stay,"This was the last stop for our trip and it did not disappoint!! The Riad is classic and more rustic than modern- however it is clean and spacious. Our room was on the second floor- a good size with a wonderful bathroom sporting a huge marble bathtub. The cleaning service turn down the room everyday to replenish towels and toiletries/ make the bed etc. Breakfast was to order, crepes, eggs, croissants etc. The staff were really excellent and booked us into local restaurants and made reservations. As I said earlier, it wasn’t the most modern Riad that we had stayed at but the attentive staff and wonderful service we received made it so welcoming. In the end it topped all the fancy places we had stayed at in Marrakesh and would definitely recommend and book again!! A real…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2019,5,Fine Place,"This is an excellent place to stay in Essaouira. The riad has been beautifully re novated, the accommodations are very comfortable, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a spacious, boldly decorated room on an upper floor, overlooking the courtyard and rooftop terrace. Their location, away from the center of the medina, was quiet, and was close enough to the center of the city for easy access to restaurants, shops, and the ocean. They served a delicious breakfast – made to-order – each morning. We were impressed by the staff. They were all friendly, and spent time with us going over the city layout. They offered plenty of good suggestions for restaurants, shops, and sights. One on staff even contacted us by email before our arrival, letting us choose in…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2019,5,Really Lovely Riad!,"Honestly everything I could have asked for. Friendly staff, beautifully appointed, peaceful and elegant. The staff were friendly and SO warm and helpful. When I asked about nice gifts, they offered to go shopping with me. When I had trouble getting to see the Jewish Cemetery they contacted the caretaker. When I had a very early bus to Marrakech they had fresh squeezed juice, hot coffee and a bag of pastries ready for me to take with. So nice. The location is on the east side of the Medina which is a bit off the beaten path. But the whole are is so small it was a non-issue. Stay here - you wont regret it!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

They organised taxis for us, a trip to the Val DÁrgon vineyard and also recommended restaurants to us. Our room was large and full of character and the bed was very comfortable.

This is by far the best place I have stayed in. From my moment we walked through the door we were made to feel special. We were given cake and coffee in the beautiful courtyard, the duty manager sat down with us and showed us a map with all the sights on it and circled them all for us. Our room was stunning, soo romantic and had bottled water a massive bath, private outdoor seating coffee machine and lovely toiletries. We had a couple of minor problems but they were sorted out within minutes by duty manager gregor, the coffee machine was replaced and the janitor opened the safe which ran out of battery.

 January 2019,4,Outstanding Customer Service,"Riad Chbante provided some of the best customer service we had on our stay in Morocco, even when compared to properties that were more expensive/exclusive. The staff are extremely accommodating, warm, and willing to help with almost any request. The rooms are nice and well appointed. The only drawback was there is slight smell emanating from the Medina itself, and this can be noticeable while on the property. I alerted the staff and they did their best to mitigate the issue. This may be an issue anywhere you stay in the Medina. It is what it is. Otherwise, I would highly recommend Riad Chbante.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 December 2018,5,A palace away from home,Stayed here on my second trip to Essauira and was left awed. The outside of the building conceals what can only be described as an Arabian palace with the most kindest of staff. They practically pamper you here and the rooms are spacious and well furnished. Breakfast is served in front of a log fire for those December esauira mornings when it can get a bit cold.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2018,5,Hospitality like no other.,"It was our first time in morocco, and our very first stop was Essaouira, specifically in Riad Chbanate. Riad Chbanate cared greatly for their guests, from the moment even before we arrived. They emailed me a couple of times ensuring that we had transport from the Marrakesh Menara Airport. When i told them i would be driving, they were so thoughtful and worried that we would not be able to find parking. Emailed me the exact GPS points, and even mentioned that there wil be a porter waiting for us to help us with the luggages. When we arrived, we were in awe of the beautiful courtyard - as in thier pics! More importantly we were greeted with smiles and such hospitality, that made us so comfortable the minute we reached.

The room was stunning and comfortable, I still dreaming about that bathtub.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2018,5,Loved it!,Myself and my partner stayed here having stayed in a couple of different riads in both Essaouira and Marrakech. The decor and furniture in the room itself was stunning and my favourite out of all the riads which are pretty lush in the first instance anyway. The staff were helpful and smiley and helped us out booking our coach tickets- they even went to collect them! We didn’t eat in the Riad other than breakfast (which was lovely) as we had stayed in a few nights at the others but went to the places recommended by the staff and were not disappointed. The restaurant Adwak was the best food we had in the whole 2 weeks and is a must. The place itself is a quaint little port and a very picturesque. It’s great that it has such a lovely beach and is small enough to walk from one…,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2018,5,Great help for a short visit,"The room was great, but it’s the staff that made this visit amazing.

 October 2018,5,Great Riad,"This is a great place to stay in Essaouira. We were met by Sammy & Noelle for check-in - very easy with a coffee / tea. Noelle took us through the map of the area (made sure we knew where our Riad was), things to see, good restaurants etc. Nothing is too much for the team at the Riad - so willing to help. The room was great with a bath that is huge (perfect for me as I am 6'5""). The centre courtyard of the riad is open to the sky so there is great light and creates a lovely open feeling away from the hustle & bustle (not that Essaouira has that much!). We had to leave early (7am) on the last day to catch our flight from Marrakech. One of the team was up to collect our bags at 6:40am & made us coffee / tea with some pastries before we left.

We decided to come back because we fell in love with Essaouira and stayed one night. The welcoming in the Riad was very good. Naoual offered us tea and coffee and some sweets. She explained a map of Essaouira (French, English and Arabic talking) and then showed us the room. The room was like the pictures (even better). We had the romantic suite, which is big, clean and romantic. There is also some free water in the room. The Riad itself is very nice Moroccan decorated and I liked the music they played.

 March 2018,5,My favorite Riad,"We stayed in several riads throughout Morocco, and this one was my favorite. The riad is in a great location within the medina, and a short walk to the beach. It is beautifully decorated with minimalist touches. Our room on the top floor was worth the many stairs it took to get there (warning for those who can't do stairs). We had a view of the ocean, and it had the most luxurious bathroom with an enormous tub that connected to a terrace. Rose petals were sprinkled throughout, which gave it a honeymoon-suite air to it, however ruined by the presence of my kids ;)! Breakfast is served in a lovely room that included a sitting area with a lit fire, making it very cozy. And they served croissants! It was a real treat, particularly the chocolate ones for my kids. The yogurt…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,A great find !,"This place is fantastic, a jewel in Essaouira. It's clean, welcoming, and beautifully designed with a Spanish twist. Upon entering you are immediately transported to another world as the staff invites you to relax in the lush and lovely courtyard. The dining room is just adjacent and has a fireplace. Breakfast is fresh, and dinner is delicious (added bonus: they offer cooking classes). The rooms are spacious, and beds and pillows are comfortable. The Romantic Suite and Comfort Suite have large soaking tubs (!) and the latter has a vichy shower with good water pressure. The bathroom in the Romantic Suite is really big and the tub is half the room. The rooms have working fireplaces which we used. The staff is incredibly friendly and very helpful. They provided for our every need.…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,Amazing Riad and Wonderful service !!!,"We stayed at the Riad at the beginning of our road trip to the South of Morocco., and we were amazingly surprised but of the quality of service and the friendliness of the staff. We had booked the Superior Bedroom and we are blown away by the bathtub!!! The team is very nice and extremely helpful. A Big THANK YOU to them and especially to HICHAM. After the check out, on the way to our next destination, my daughter realized she had forgotten her favorite stuffed animal in the room. I called the hotel and they had found it. They send it to me by Express Mail, AND I DID NOT TO PAY ANYTHING !!!! I COULD NEVER THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THAT !!!!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,Amazing Riad in Essouira,"During the 2 weeks travel in Marokko it was surely the nicest stay we had. The team is extremely nice, helpful with anything and naturally friendly. The rooms are nice and well isolated. The breakfest and dinner is also very good. Nothing to complain here. Its located in the middle of the medina. Essouira is a lovely town, we prefer it very much compared to Marrakesh as it is by far not so crowdy and the people are generally much more relaxed. If we come back to Essouira, Riad Chbanate will it be again. Prices are above 100€, so upper middle class i would say. But its worth.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,AMAZING!,"I was there with my couple and I can tell that this Riad is amazing in all the aspects, the room it's so romantic and confortable, I would like that mattress in my home, it's soft like a cloud.

And thanks for Hicham to take care for all at the moment of the booking. I wish come back right now.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2018,5,Spectacular room and friendly service,"We stayed here during our honeymoon and the staff has specially decorated our room for us. We had the most gorgeous bathtub area and enjoyed that greatly. Staff was helpful and we liked the location. Also, having a minifridge in the room was nice for the yummy olives we bought in the market! The breakfast was good (though for coffee drinkers waiting the 15 min for it to be prepared might be tough). We did learn to keep our room A/C unit to ""dry"" setting due to the climate.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 March 2018,5,Riad with 4* Atmosphere Rooms,"First to say, staying in a hotel in Morocco may be fine, but Riad's do promise experiences & impressions to understand the hustle and bustle in the narrow alleys and help to really arrive, where you've just been flying too. This Riad is situated at the beginning of the medina, easy to reach from any part of Essaouira (and easy to find - maybe more important!) and for sure offers the highest quality in exterior and interior you can expect from any Riad. To be honest, we've been never sleeping so good like here. Behind the Riad walls you enjoy the warm and cosy atmosphere of a fantastic neat accommodation with great service and friendly staff. Perfect for having a break from Marrakesh and also perfect to enjoy the relaxing atmosphere of Essaouira and it's fresh seafood.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

It’s situated within the medina and only a short walk to all the restaurants and shops. The suite was just lovely with a huge bathroom and one of the most comfy beds we slept on in Morocco. The decor was fantastic too. There is a small terrace upstairs which was a great spot for sunbathing in the afternoon. Mostly though we appreciated the excellent service which was always friendly and professional; we were lucky to stay in some brilliant Riads during our travels in Morocco but are happy to say that we enjoyed our stay here the best.

Giant bath, wooden floor and a fireplace, I understood why the room is on the comfort category. The staff was incredible kind m too, from samira on the mornings to gregui on the nights, they made us feel as if we were in home. The city of esauira is a must: Big sandy beaches, cheap fresh fish and seafood, full of diferent exemples of the moroccain culture...

P.S: I forgot to mention how good it was to be on the terrace listening some jazz, sunbathing, and enjoying the Tea made by the staff... Agh!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2017,5,"Uncharted, yet charming","After four days of sightseeing around Marrakech we came across with Essaouira, that is, a marvelous and dazzling coastal walled city roughly 100 miles westwards. It was well worth the few travel hours, as spending three days there turned out to be a delightful and enthralling experience not only thanks to the equipment, decoration & architecture (absolutely gorgeous and out of this world), but also thanks to the crew and service, who treated us wonderfully all day long and even heartwarmingly greeted us with a little gift when we arrived. After that, they helped and took care for us during the whole trip, providing very useful recommendations or insight about the city's life. The food was exquisite and we could enjoy very generous gourmet breakfasts cooked right next to the…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2017,5,Gorgeous Riad,"My sister and I stayed at Riad Chbanate for 3 nights and have a wonderful stay. The Raid is very tastefully decorated, the room we had was a large double room with a fantastic shower and bath decorated in wooden tiles, really beautiful. The staff were amazing, friendly, helpful, always around to help. On arrival we were given a map and Noel sat with us marked of the places of interest and the best routes in and out of the Medina. We were also given excellent recommendations for restaurants and a Hamman. Breakfast was lovely; fresh fruit salad, bread, pancakes and pain au chocolate and we were asked if we wanted any eggs or anything else but we were already stuffed. We really enjoyed coming back to the riad one evening and having a lovely bottle of wine and nibbles in front of…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

The service was great (Gregui and Hisham did wonders) and for the couple of days I was there breakfast was fantastic! They also do dinners but I was out, during nights. I saw they do surf experiences and all type of activities. I recommend this place as a must if you are looking for somewhere to spend some chill and lovely time!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Vacation,"Tomorrow I am leaving this wonderful gem. We stayed for three nights and I wish I had more days to stay. The people that work here are amazing! Helpful, warm, gracious and genuinely concerned about your trip to their wonderful city Essaoura. The hospitality that was shown to us was the best in our two week journey. When my husband was curious about the music that was piped in the garden area, a playlist was created by the time returned. The staff is young, helpful and willing to go out of their way to help, they are all fabulous. The breakfast served every morning is cooked from the kitchen that is visible from the garden of the Riad. Delicious and served with the warmest smile you could hope for. At most other hotels breakfast was buffet style with drinks served by waitstaff.…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Lovely!,"We had a lovely time at this Riad. It's located in the medina close to the supratours bus stop which was very convenient for us.

This Riad served the best breakfast we had in all our time in Morocco.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Hidden gem,"Just saw I hadn't reviewed this from my trip last year. This place is well hidden on the outskirts of the walled city of essoauira. When you enter it is just wonderful inside, a complete contrast to the outside. The hotel is a great place to relax in, just don't tread on the tortoises. There are plenty of places to relax on the ground floor and it has a roof terrace with views of the ocean. We were given good recommendations for places to eat and visit and breakfast was delicious with attentive servers. Our room was huge and had lovely views.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

The staff is super friendly and helpfull and the breakfast is also very good.... all in all we can only recommend this place, we would definitely stay there again! Please book the superior room on the top floor or the panorama room, you wont regret the few extra $... Regarding parking.. there's a big parking south to the riad, you should only pay 21 mad per night but the parking guys are super unfriendly and try to scam you into paying before you park and before you leave... make sure you get a ticket when you pay and dont be afraid of discussing 15min with them about your ticket price and pretend to call the riad...",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,"Really lovely riad, first class","Riad Chbanate is picture perfect. It has a beautiful and well-tended open air living area complete with a little box turtle. The rooms were luxurious and open with plenty of light coming in. The bathroom has a nice large tub. The breakfast was enough to keep us fueled for a week. Also, I should say the staff was unfailingly nice and couldn't have been more helpful. They only added to the charm of the place. We now have a new high standard that we will measure other riads against. Sorry other riads!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,Comfortable and quiet room in a lovely riad,The spacious room with the the large bath add comfort to the nice common rooms on the main floor.

 February 2017,5,Beautiful riad with excellent service,"Stayed 5 nights here with friends and had a room on the 2nd floor. The bed was large and very comfortable and we had one of the largest and most impressive bathrooms I've ever seen! Everything was clean and well-maintained and the service was excellent - relaxed, friendly and informative, including on good places to eat. The central courtyard, open to the elements, was really attractive and there was also a dining room off that which always had a log fire burning. Breakfast consisted of good coffee, a very generous portions of bread, pancakes and pastries with loads of spreads. Omelettes were also available upon request. It was a bit chilly while we were there so we didn't spend much time on the roof terrace, but it was a very pleasant sheltered spot. A very feel-good experience…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2017,3,Lovely riad but a bit over priced,"This is the most expensive riad that we have stayed in so the criteria is a bit tougher. We had booked many months in advance our room on the roof terrace through Booking.com. On arrival we received a warm welcome together with mint tea and biscuits in the ground floor courtyard. Our suite was at the very top of the riad above the main roof terrace and was very spacious. Lined with light timber it was very light and airy and had views over the rooftops and out to sea.The king size bed was very comfy and came with crisp white linen. There was a seating area with tv, fridge and coffee supplied. The bathroom had a sunken bath with rain water shower, good toiletries and another little terrace. All very impressive but not as quiet as a normal riad room as it cops a bit of traffic…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,This place is a marvel - I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else,"I rated out Riad in Marrakesh a four, compared to this place it deserves a one! The staff are wonderful, always accommodating and the rooms are breathtaking. My favorite spot...sitting by the fire enjoying a nice cup of mint tea. These guys will literally do anything for you...speak to Nawal...I think that's how you say it, she's the Gem of Essaouira",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,"Charming riad, charming people","The Riad is very charming and romantic (oversized bathtub, room decorated with rose petals upon arrival, fireplaces everywhere and white+red colors used throughout the rooms and common areas, ... ) I personally loved the wood-themed main living room, where we spent an evening playing chess & cards (at disposal) by the fireplace or sipped moroccan mint tea while reading a book. The staff is lovely and very helpful - kuddos in particular to Nawal and Samira for their long hours and tireless assistance. Beware the easiest access to the Riad is through an unnamed and small ""Bab"" (door), slightly on the right of Bab Marrakech. Also rooms facing the street can be a little bit noisy.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2016,5,Perfect,"Great riad to stay in in Essaouira. Lovely, clean, spacious and the staff are very very friendly and informative.

 November 2016,5,Stunning Riad,"I have just returned from 4 nights staying at this beautiful Riad with my boyfriend and can't rate it highly enough. We were welcomed by Moroccan tea upon arrival and shown a map of the Madina with recommendations for restaurants and sightseeing. The room had a beautiful ceiling with a very comfortable bed and large bathroom area - the highlight of which is a wonderful huge bath surrounded by rose petals! We were on the top floor of the Riad where the terrace is which has lovely views. All the staff were very friendly and kept a constant fire going in the main reception room downstairs - it was lovely to come back there in the evening and sit by the fire whilst drinking Moroccan tea. The breakfasts were huge and delicious - freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh fruit salad,…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Romantic getaway,"I don't even know where to start. This hotel is just amazing. The moment we walked in the staff was ready to welcome us and share information about essaouira- the best restaurants and bars, things to do, etc. The breakfast each morning was delicious with fresh fruit, squeezed orange juice, crepes, eggs, etc. The room we stayed in was exceptional, the most romantic bathroom I've ever had! The jacuzzi and rooftop terrace were also lovey and relaxing. I would highly recommend this hotel!!!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Great place to stay for the distinguished traveller,"A very nice and accommodating staff here. My friend and i are travelling around and are two larger gentleman where sharing a room as we originally booked in for would be kinda tight, they put us up in 2 different rooms for the night. Upon arriving, they provided us with a welcoming mix of sweets and mint tea. Very accommodating and pleasant. Great atmosphere in the hotel, water was hot and plenty of it...a high recommendation from me for sure!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,U can't do better,"My friend and I popped in for 1 night and were going to share a room with 2 beds. As we r about to ro-sham-bo for the queen bed, the other was a twin, Rose knocked at the door and offered us a 2nd room....we r both 6'2"" over 100kg, so to say the least she was our savoir. And it was for free...holy shxx! The place is gorgeous, romantic or (bro-mantic) in our case, comfortable and with immense character. If u choose another spot u should be examined...lol.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2016,3,Generally nice but room to improve,"We stayed there for two nights and in general the place is good but there were a few issues that really didn't help our stay. On our first night the aircon started leaking water but this was fixed immediately by changing our room which was great. The second night the riad lost electricity countless number of times which was quite annoying. Lastly they really need to restrict the times at which guests are able to use the terrace as we had a bunch of noisy Americans that made it very difficult for us to sleep. Having said all that, the riad is beautiful and the staff couldn't be any better. On any other night this place would have scored higher.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2016,4,Great hotel,"The hotel is beautiful and the staff really kind. Only inconvenience was that although they are supposed to serve food for lunch and diner unless you warn them in advance, the cook leaves. The staff offered to fetch some food for me but it was difficult to decide with no menus in hands.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Fantastic Riad in the medina,"Very cosy Riad, great for couples especially if you have the chance to stay in the Romantic Suite! Close to pretty much everything as in the medina.

Would love to come back and would highly recommend.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2016,4,Wonderful Riad,"Lovely stay in suite Mauresque, people are friendly and very helpful.

 July 2016,5,Beautiful top room,We loved our stay at Riad Chbanate. The service was excellent - we were very grateful to be picked up from the bus station and shown to the Riad. We stayed in the room at the very top which was beautiful. The spa was also nice and they were happy to give us dining recommendations. The location was great too.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,The best Riad hotel in Essaouira!,"Great find! The staff Naoual, Gragui, Samira and Hicham treat guests like family. Rooms are each uniquely decorated in a tasteful, high end, 'Moroccan stye' and have large bathtubs decorated with rose petals on arrival! (bathtubs are sooo much better than showers, in my opinion!) Stocked mini bars, sumptuous breakfasts... croissants and M'Saman (traditional pancakes), eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice, yogurt, fruit salad, coffee or the traditional mint tea. A short walk from the small door of Bab Marrakech, so it's easy to get to. I enjoyed the lovely common courtyard with comfy seating and the tranquility of the fountain...(and pet turtles!) (wifi throughout the riad) and a jacuzzi tub on the terrace! If you prefer to 'dine in', the staff will cook dinner or lunch…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Beautiful property with exceptional staff (and friendly pet turtles),"I highly recommend Riad Chbante for a stay in Essaouira. The location is great -- on the edge of the old city near all of the restaurants and shopping and not a far walk from the beach. The rooms are very pretty, well furnished and comfortable and there is a very pretty terrace. I stayed in the top most room which had a gorgeous view over the city and out to the ocean. The staff at Riad Chbante was also a highlight of my stay in Essaouira. They were all exceptionally friendly and helpful and the breakfasts were delicious. Also, they have a few friendly box turtles that wander around which never failed to make my day.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,"A lovely property, indeed...","Riad Chbanate is perfectly located in a magical city that's very easy to like and very difficult to leave.

We couldn't have been happier with our stay.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,"Romantic, luxurious, friendly riad in an absolutely hypnotizing town","Riad Chbanate was the absolute highlight of my trip to Morocco so far. Upon check-in, Noël greeted me with so much warmth, positive energy, familiarity. I was already in love before I saw my room, which was phenomenal. I ended up spending hours in the bathtub with a view of Essaouira's rooftops and a comforting breeze to refresh while I soaked up the heat. It's huge and made of limestone. The owner, Jean, is a very accomplished builder who had done 10 buildings in Essaouira. All details are exquisite and all materials are locally sourced. Noël is a local expert.

 March 2016,5,Lovely room and lovely staff - couldn't have been better!,"My husband and I just returned to the States after a really terrific trip to Morocco which included four days at Riad Chbanate. First, we received a first class welcome from Gregory, and the staff throughout our stay was very pleasant and accommodating. Our room was everything one could wish for, but the bath and shower rocked our world! Time spend in front of the fire in the dining room was very relaxing, and up on the terrace outside our room, we spent a lovely afternoon napping and reading the day away. The staff took great care of us throughout the stay, and we just loved the town of Essaouira!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2015,5,Perfect,"The Lady of the house (owner, manager ?) checked us in efficiently, whilst seated in front of the open fire with a glass of mint tea. My son and I had booked a twin room, but she spontaneously upgraded us to separate rooms, which was generous and most appreciated. The rooms are beautiful, the bathroom fit for a honeymoon suite. The same lady looked after us for breakfast, which was gourmet and plentiful. Her efficiency and friendly personal attention only adds to the attractiveness of this fine riad. I wish we could have stayed longer.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2015,5,Fabulous Riad,"We recently spent two nights at this beautiful Riad, perfectly located in the Medina of Essaouira.

We have travelled extensively over many years and Riad Chbanate is without doubt one of the very best places we have ever stayed.Very highly recommended!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,Service the Extra Mile,"We had pre booked a taxi from the airport our driver phoned ahead to the Riad to advise of our arrival at the Medina Gate - no car access in the Medina- where we met by Greggi with a hand baggage cart. These carts are the main form of transport for goods within the Medina. We checked in quickly and were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a superior room. Spotlessly clean, great bathroom facilities - however no plug, quickly sorted as we always travel with a spare. Room had no wardrobe just a hanging rail ok for a short stay but perhaps not for 5 days plus. Greggi then informed us about Essaouira with a map highlighting bars/restaurants etc. A great start. Then we were advised we were the only guests that night and he was happy to cook for us if we did not want to go out.…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 October 2015,5,Such a lovely Riad!,"We stayed at Riad Chbanate for 3 nights when we first arrived in Essaouira. The riad was lovely and very clean and felt like a sanctuary away from the street. When we walked through the door we were welcomed by Noelle who was the host. When we met Noelle we instantly felt welcomed and taken care of! She was so sweet and so helpful that she made our stay exceptional. When we realized that our SIM cards were out she went and bought us new ones and installed them for us and even filed one down so it fit perfectly! As a matter of fact every person that worked at Riad Chbanate was so genuinely friendly and accommodating.

The breakfasts were ample and well-prepared and the staff was always there to greet us and offer us snacks (delicious!), tea, wine, etc. Our clothes got really soaked in a down pour and they dried everything for us.

The breakfast was amazing and you can have it anytime you wake up even at 14:00! The staff were very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed the rooftop with its jacuzzi as well.

Located conveniently within the Medina but in a quieter quarter, this riad is a true oasis. From the beautifully arranged courtyard to the luxury and super comfortable rooms, every part of this riad is fabulous. The sun terrace on the 3rd floor is a lovely place for a relax and has both sun and shady spots and views over the rooftops of the medina. However the real secret of the Riad Chbanate has to be the amazing staff. Samira, Noelle and Gregor. They made our stay truly brilliant and memorable.

The staff was extremely helpful, especially Noel who was such a pleasure! (She even accompanied me to a local hammam, in addition to advising us on where to dine and helping us plan activities.)

They obviously love their jobs and have a wonderful French owner who has trained them to be independent and solicitous of your every need. The breakfast table heaved every morning with pastries, local honey, hot chocolate, pancakes and various preserves. The roof patio was perfectly private and the Jacuzzi was a real treat. The bathrooms were heavenly - plenty of steaming hot water, rose petals and vast bath. Free cold drinks in the min-bar and a turtle called Chabanat to play with when you need a break from the excellent shopping and eating.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Very welcoming with a real sense of 'home',"The Riad is a hidden gem on the edge of the main streets of the busy Medina. Once inside, behind the large wood door you will be cosseted in the most delightful Moroccan surroundings with tiered balconies and the open auditorium. At night the soft lighting, candles together with gentle running water in the feature pond creates a splendidly relaxed atmosphere. This calmness is perfect after the frenetic activities of the Medina and the gusting breeze along the wide open sand beach. The staff are major factor, as they take great care to ensure you have the perfect time. Arranging trips, shopping, hairdressing, taxis, drinks and if requested an evening meal. The rooms are classic style, beautifully appointed, clean, very comfortable bedding and a fantastic bathroom with…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 June 2015,5,A luxury home from home.,"Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at this riad - we were made fresh mint tea every time we came through the door, they even went and got our bus tickets for us! It is beautifully decorated with comfy beds and amazing bathrooms! Would recommend to anyone. Any travelers worried about visiting during Ramadan need not!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 June 2015,5,Perfection,"Riad Chbanate looks exactly, if not better than the photos online. I was initially hesitant about the price as there are so many cheaper hotels/Riads in Essaouira however it was worth every penny. Excellent staff, very accommodating. Beautiful decoration (particularly the bathroom) & everything we needed. We were looked after extremely well (even after missing our flight and arriving at 10pm) and would highly recommend anyone to stay in this Riad. We wanted for nothing & were treated extremely well. I wish we could have stayed longer and we were very sad to leave. Thanks very much",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 June 2015,5,"Fantastic service, fantastic team","Just returned from what can only be described as a once in a life time experience in Essaouira made even more special by the ever accommodating and professional team at the Raid Chbanate. Our party of six arrived on Friday afternoon to the warmest of welcomes. I would say their motto must be ""Nothing is to much"" as we were treated like kings throughout our stay. We settled into our rooms - AMAZING - and proceeded to drinks and dinner. Dinner is prepared for you at your request when you arrive and for the three evenings we eat a menu that was bespoke to our taste requirements. Lamb Tagine eat your heart out, this place knows how to cook! Food, service and overall accommodating of all our needs were 5 star and i cannot thank them enough for their hospitality. On our final…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2015,5,Hospitality defined,"We arrived late at night and found our way from the street into the Medina to the Riad. Noel met us at the door, had our luggage brought in and showed two weary travelers to their room. Because it was late and we had no eaten, Noel made us a chicken tangine for dinner and we used the 2 person, giant tub to unwind. While the Riad rooms are clumsy, we loved the roof deck and the breakfasts. It was an extremely charming experience and the staff took care of all our needs including securing tickets to our bus travel.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2015,4,Great solicitude!,"My daughter and I stayed at Riad Chbanate for 2 nights in May 2015. Its location is not in the most picturesque part of the medina, but it is in fact within just a few minutes' walk of the beach. We had a large room with an enormous bath and the staff had immediately added a separate bed after they realised that we were not a couple! The lady in charge in the morning speaks both excellent French and English. Over and above the normal very friendly welcome from all the staff that we had been led to expect from the Tripadvisor reviews, the staff showed immense solicitude when my daughter fell ill only a few hours after our arrival (which was in no way attributable to anything at Riad Chbanate). They arranged to send someone out to find out which pharmacy was open at night and go…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2015,5,Charming Riad with Excellent Service,"I can't imagine a more perfect riad in Essaouira. We received a warm welcome from the staff who instantly made us feel at home. We were given an excellent orientation and the staff graciously helped organize our lunch and dinner reservations each day. I can only echo what every other reviewer has mentioned - the level of hospitality and service is superlative. Our room (although not the one we booked) was absolutely lovely. And comfy! The bedroom area was the perfect size and the bathroom was stunning -- and huge. The courtyard was peaceful and lovely place to have breakfast. We spent an hour or so on the roof deck, which was a bit windy in early April and did not feel quite as luxurious as the rest of the riad. You cannot see the water from the riad, but we felt the…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2015,5,Stunning riad in the Essaouira Medina,"I arrived late for my too-short stay at this fabulous riad and was immediately impressed by my gracious welcome. I was shown to a seat by the fireplace and offered a glass of wine before being accompanied to my suite and it was a perfect way to relax from my travel and the energy of the medina. My suite was absolutely lovely and the bathroom... well, after whitewater rafting for 4 days and traveling in the desert for as many, the bathtub (in which you could float a boat!) was a welcome site. I do regret not staying in the riad for dinner, instead of going back out to dine. The next morning breakfast, while similar to those I had throughout my trip, was hands-down the best I had. Had I stayed longer I'm sure I would have found this to be a convenient location. I would love to…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2015,5,Luxurious Riad at the edge of the Medina,"We stayed here for three nights at the end of our round trip. Our room (Oriental Suite) was very beautiful and large. They have a Jaccuzzi at the beautiful roof top terrace. The dinner was really delicious. The whole staff was very friendly and helpful. The location of the riad is at the edge of the medina and not at the coast. For us it was ok, because it's near the parking. Anyway, the Medina of Essaouira is not too big, you can walk everywhere easily.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2015,4,"Very Pretty Riad, Fine Location","The Riad is very beautiful inside, with a charming courtyard. The rooms are also stunning, with rustic wooden ceilings, and large bathrooms (at least that was ours). The location is a bit off the beaten path. The Medina in Essaouira is small, but the riad is tucked in a corner on the far end from the port and most of the areas of interest. At night, you must walk down dark streets to get there, which is fine but not ideal. The hotel staff was very friendly, but their restaurant recommendations were not great. They pushed the touristy places that Tripadvisor reviewers pan (and rightfully so), but they did a good job of guiding us to the best views in the city. We got the impression that the hotel has an absentee owner. The staff worked extremely hard, constantly running…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2015,5,Romantic getaway in Essaouira,"My husband and I spent 4 nights here at the end of a 10-day trip to Morocco and had a wonderful time. Our beautifully-decorated room was furnished with everything we needed and was right off the roof deck, so we had a lovely outdoor area to enjoy the sunshine. When we arrived, it was decorated with rose petals and fresh flowers, and the bathroom was stocked with custom-made toiletries. From the moment we arrived, the staff looked after us and were extremely helpful in making restaurant recommendations and marking points of interest on the map. Breakfast included fresh fruit, yogurt, crepes, pastries, and fresh OJ, and we also enjoyed mint tea and pastries in the beautiful courtyard. Everything was delicious and the service was very gracious. The riad is located just inside…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2015,5,Absolutely perfect!,"My boyfriend and I had a fantastic stay at Riad Chbanate. From the warm welcome we received when we arrived, to the beautiful room and the incredible breakfast we couldn't fault our stay at all. It's in a great location, just 5 mins walk from the main square but the riad is a quiet and peaceful oasis from the bustling streets outside. The staff were helpful and suggested some excellent places for dinner each night. The only downside was that we were offered tea/wine/beer and peanuts when we arrived back at the riad each day and we assumed these were free but found when we checked out that we'd been charged for the alcoholic drinks which would have been good to know when we were ordering them. But we'd still definitely recommend this riad to anyone staying in Essaouira!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2015,5,If you are visiting Essaouira then book this RIad!,"This riad is superb.It's not only the location,beautiful rooms,wonderful breakfasts but the very special service by all the staff,especially Nowal and Greggi.Nothing is too much trouble....everything is done,and acted on,quickly and efficiently.Like a lot of the Trip Advisor readers and contributors,we have been to many of the most famous hotels in the world but right now the service will not be better than Riad Chbanate!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2015,5,Stay here...,"Having previously stayed in hotels, this was our first time in a Riad and we were blown away at how we were looked after. Although the Riad itself is very beautiful, it's the staff that make the experience something special - they can't do enough for you, so getting everything you want out of your trip becomes so easy. We stayed in the Zen room, but all the rooms, the salon with its roaring fire, the pretty courtyard and the roof terrace with sunbeds are all so stylish. I got the impression that some regular French visitors to Morocco make repeat visits here and it's not surprising when you are made to feel so at home. The breakfasts are great, but the staff also talked us through maps of the old medina (important as it can be tricky finding your way around, despite the medina…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2015,5,Perfect location,"we stayed at the Riad Chbante at the beginning of February and from the moment we arrived we were made to feel at home, nothing was too much trouble for Greggi or Samira. Rooms were spotlessly clean and very comfortable the bath was amazing. The location was perfect very close to the centre of the medina and we were able to walk around with no problems. Fantastic well worth 5 stars.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2015,5,a cozy oasis in the middle of the city,"This riad has convincing us from the beginning, it is generously built and you´ve always the feeling that you are in a private setting. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The rooms are tastefully decorated.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,Fantastic stay,Fantastic room with lots of space. Fantastic service with friendly staff. Great location only minutes walk to the old town centre. The staff where very helpful the location is close to the city centre. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. All in all 5 Starts.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2015,5,An oasis of calm in the bustle of the Medina,"Just returned from a week at the Riad Chbanate. From the moment we arrived we felt relaxed and made to feel at home by the excellent Greggi and Samira. Nothing was too much trouble for them and the rest of the team. The breakfast every morning was first class, freshly made and plenty of it. The rooms were a good size, lovely decor and we found the bed to our taste. The location is ideal for a walk to the bustling Medina, and we were advised on places to eat and shop and provided maps to help. Only downside is the trip from the airport, but that will change in May when direct flights to Essouria from UK begin. All in all an excellent week, made all the better by the kind and professional service of all the staff. Thanks for making our stay so good.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,"Amazing Riad, incredible service","From the moment we walked through the door we knew this Riad would be amazing. Fantastic location in the Medina, and the staff provided excellent hospitality and great recommendations (restaurants, hammam, walking/shopping directions). Our room was beautiful, with plenty of space and a lovely bathroom. The roof terrace is the perfect sun trap, even with a hot tub! Incredible breakfasts - fresh orange juice, coffee, pancakes, pastries - and a wonderful ambiance with an open log fire and relaxing jazz music. I can't imagine a better Riad!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2014,5,"Excellent, thoroughly enjoyable.","Excellent Riad, as someone else wrote on here, don't think about it, just book it. I stayed for three nights with my wife and 7yr old kid. And as experienced travellers we all rated this as one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. Hotel ambience was nice, nice music, nice atrium. Staff were incredibly friendly, helpful, hospitable. Their attitude seemed genuine, not forced. Noelle was very helpful and friendly. Sadly i didn't catch the name of the other woman, nor of the gent who lit the fire in my room every evening. The room - perfect. Great bed, great design and interior decor. Everything was very clean. Good size room on 1st floor. (There are stairs to all floors, no elevator, not great perhaps if you're not good on stairs...) Huge wood fire in corner of room,…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,"Perfect Riad, and super great service","This Riad is the perfect hotel experience in Essaouira. A fabulously renovated, unique, intimate hotel, right in the heart of the beautiful and relaxed seaside town. The staff were all super sweet, and took exceptional care of us, answering our every email promptly and giving us expert suggestions on dining and activities/sights around Essaouira. They were able to handle our many questions with ease, and not only recommended cosy restaurants for dinner, but booked a day's hiking trip with a Berber guide, which was sublime. We visited in winter, and our room was spacious and extremely cosy, with a wonderful fire in the downstairs dining room. We loved our stay here and couldn't recommend it more highly.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,Great hospitality,Riad Chabanate will definitely be our hotel of choice in Essaouira on future trips! We loved the spacious room with the large bathtub and the fireplace the staff lit for us every evening. A big plus: unlike most other riads at that time of year the room was heated to a comfortable temperature. Breakfast can be enjoyed on the sunny terrace if requested. The people at the Riad were always eager to help us with useful hints and recommendations! We felt at home immediately!,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2014,4,Fantastic Service,"From the minute we arrived Noelle and the other staff really looked after us. She made a superb home cooked meal on our first night, arranged a cooking class and another restaurant for day 2, and made sure we saw all best of the local sights. Our room was immaculately clean and tastefully furnished, and the bathroom was as large as many entire hotel rooms. The street it is in was a bit grubby and noisy, more real Morocco than resort territory, but that added to its charm. My wife was flashed in that street so women should take care if walking there alone.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2014,5,"Delightful staff, beautiful Riad","The warmth and generosity of the staff is what makes this Riad so special. The rooms are lovely, especially the bathrooms, but it's the service that makes it stand out. If I had to name a flaw, I might single out the somewhat uninspired supper, but really it was fine. Not worth losing a point over.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2014,5,Amazing experience!,"Having changed email addresses several times over the last two years, I find myself having to join trip advisor again and am only doing so having promised Noelle that I would review Riad Chbanate! My husband and I stayed here for two nights in mid December and we're both absolutely delighted with the riad and the service. I noticed on arrival that we had been discreetly upgraded to the Zen room, with a suspended bed and such a calming ambience. The philosophy of the owners and staff is reflected in everything, from the cleanliness of the riad to the fresh flowers, quality toiletries, wonderful breakfast and such helpful staff. A special mention to Noelle and Greggy for being so attentive and apologies for not mentioning by name, the girl who checked us in. Although December is…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Great Riad,"My wife and I stayed at Riad Chbanate for 2 nights and 3 days in the middle of November. This is probably one of the best riads in Essaouira. The room was awesome, very clean, very luxurious. The bedding was high end, the bathroom was INSANE, the shower was the best we had in Morocco, the food was awesome (breakfast was seriously so good), and the service was the best. Noelle saw to it that we were taken care of every step of the way and made sure that wherever we wanted to eat and whatever we wanted to do was booked without having to ask twice. Even had a nice late night hang with her by the fireplace over a drink to to discuss world events and our different cultures :). The location is perfect as well, right in the Medina (which is very small compared to Marrakech). …",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,Highly recomended,"This riad is an oasis in the medina. Helpful and very attentive staff, lovely room with plenty of space and a gigantic bed which proved extremely comfortable. Everything was very clean. Can definitely recommend.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,wonderful,Spent 3 nights here last week during a fortnight holiday in Morocco. Our room was superb with a huge bath and there were lots of wonderful toiletries. The staff were absolutely fantastic and so helpful. The riad is in a great location with parking close by.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Excellent,Stayed two nights here and it was awesome. Noel and Greggy are true stars and looked after as very well. Room (especially the bathroom) was very nice. They even upgraded the room for free which was very nice of them. Riad is close to Supratours bus station so you can walk to riad easily.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Stunning place to stay,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in early November. We'd just spent 4 nights in Marrakech and were ready to leave the bustle and relax by the coast. Essaouira was the perfect place to do that with the charm of the typical Moroccan souks (just on a much smaller scale than Marrakech) and a beautiful coastal location, as well as a much more relaxed atmosphere. The riad is ideally located in the quiet backstreets of the medina and you are immediately struck by the beautiful craftsmanship of the building when you walk in. Our room was just the standard room on the first floor but it was incredible with a really nice bathroom and comfy bed. Staff were really friendly but a special mention for Greggi (not sure if that's spelt right) who really made us feel at home and even…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Essaouria Riad,"Riad CHBANATE IN ESSAOURIA providedd an outstanding experience to our two week stay touring Morroco. This riad is gorgeous. Clean, open but private, a great fireplace and above all a very helpful staff. The riad is convenient, close to the gates, parking and in a great place in the medina. The staff was very helpful in directing us to a great Hammam for a scrubbing and massage. We loved it there.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,"We called it ""The Happy Place""","RIAD CHBANATE - What a room we had at the Riad Chbanate; huge and with a walk-in bathroom with a very large round shower/tub, larger than any bathroom we have ever had. But even more memorable were the all female staff members whose lively and happy chatter during meal preparation and general cleaning was so infectious as to be a total joy. The food was also very good, including a delicious dinner. And the location near one of the smaller entrances to the medina made locating the Riad very easy. But the happy and smiling staff was unforgettable. as were the roses and other flowers all over the place. In fact, my wife called it “The Happy Place”!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,Calm within the storm.,"Essaouria is a living breathing medina with souks for the locals. The warren of back streets is much smaller than Marrakech but as it's less touristy its more real but a little more edgy at night. The hustle and bustle and scooters and cats are escaped by entering the riad. Ahhhh bliss. The service is warm and friendly. Much more like being in someone's home than a hotel. Beautiful decor, both the common areas and the rooms. The riad is near a medina entrance and against the outer wall. Finding it ""again"" is therefore straight forward. A little like a maze the medina so handy at the nights end. The road staff will recommend restaurants, organise activities and taxis. If I return to Essaouria I will stay here again. No doubt.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,Absolutely fantastic,"We spent three days here and wish we had stayed here for the entire week of our holidays. The decor is top class and fantastic! Every attention paid to keeping things just the way guests would want it, fires burning in the living room, cooking that is out of this world - breakfast choices that just keep coming; nothing is too much problem - bring you a cup of tea to the fourth floor, no problem; make you a reservation to have a massage NOW, no problem; where can I go for a cheap fish lunch? no problem. Since we were travelling with our 26 year old son, we were given a room for 3 - the honeymoon suite on the rooftop. Man! did we get lucky. We had terrific views of the sea, separate outside sitting areas which were not overlooked; a sunken bath, your own nespresso machine and…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,Such a wonderful stay...,"We can't sing the praises of Riad Chbanate enough. It is a gorgeous riad with the kindest, most attentive staff. The rooms are beautiful and it's a great location in Essaouria. It is perfect for a romantic holiday (we are at the end of an extended honeymoon). The rooms look exactly as pictured,..beautifully furnished, and romantically laden with rose petals! We wish we didn't have to leave! A special mention to the wonderful staff - especially Greggi, Noel and Samira (apologies if the names are not spelled correctly)...they are truly the loveliest, most welcoming people!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,nice stay,"we spent 5 days in this hotel on last september and were very happy of our stay. Rooms are of high standing, clean and very nicely decorated with morrocan style. The whole hotel is very cosi, and the staff discreet and highly competent. Very good knowledge of the area and recommandations on what to do or see in the surroundings, thanks for good tips! Food is just perfect, especially breafast. We really enjoyed our time in Essaouira city, which worth to be seen at least once. We would definetly recommand this hotel for anyone looking for a cosi and revitalizing stay.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,Nicest Riad we stayed in!,"The Riad is beautiful, such a brilliant stay and didn't want to leave.

Would definately recommend, you won't be disappointed.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,amazing riad - wish we could have stayed longer,"This beautiful riad is set on the edge of the medina, which makes it easy to find. It is very well run by friendly, helpful staff. The rooms are clean, spacious and tastefully decorated and really do look like in the pictures, even down to the rose petals around the bath. The breakfast is very tasty and we were given some good tips for restaurants in the medina. The roof terrace offers plenty of space for the number of guests and if you don't book the room with the amazing bath, then the jacuzzi is up and running within 15 minutes. We loved staying here and will certainly be back!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 July 2014,5,"gorgeous oasis, home away from home, sumptuous bed!","We were so grateful to the staff of the Riad, and also whoever designed it..for creating a veritable oasis of calm, and beauty and kindness...we were really made to feel like it was our home, and nothing we asked for was too much trouble. Noel and Greggy, are total stars, and whoever owns the place is lucky to have such good staff, running this beautiful and tasteful Riad. Red and white roses added to the charm, and I really did not want to leave...i would recommend, and also return to this gorgeous place, in a flash....Thank you!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,Riad Chbanate: love story alike,The evening I returned home from Riad Chbanate in Essaouira I booked right away again my next trip to the same place. In the meanwhile – after a numerous amount of visits – I describe the whole staff as my friends. In november 2013 I’ve booked the entire riad for some days and invited my employees with accompaniment for a wonderful regenerating stay. This place has become part of my life and so to say ... I thank myself deeply having discovered it.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 August 2014,5,Perfect service annd lovely place,"Having looked at a few Riads in Essaouira, this has to be the best or one of the best. We stayed in the Oriental suite which has a good sized room and a great bathroom. The Riad has plenty of areas for you to sit and chill out in and the service we got was excellent. Noel and Greggy were lovely; incredibly helpful, really accommodating and a joy to deal with - a big thanks for them. All in all, highly recommended!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 August 2014,5,Amazing place,"Beautiful riad and fantastic staff without exception , I would like to address our thanks to each one of the team for making our stay memorable. Definitely to recommend , very nice atmosphere and great breakfast",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 July 2014,5,Another hidden gem!,The Medina in Essaouira is smaller and less chaotic than Marrakech. But again this riad was a gem behind a wooden door leading from a non-descript street/alley way. We were greeted by friendly staff and enjoyed a glass of mint tea as our luggage was taken to our room. We were in the Tyfina Suite and my daughter and I were surprised by how comfortable the hanging chair in the room was. It was our favorite detail! The room had a beautiful ambiance – and it was also comfortable and spacious. The staff suggested some restaurants – and the two we tried were both delicious and VERY reasonably priced. I would certainly stay here again.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 August 2013,5,Beautiful. Attentive service.,"We stayed here for a week and couldn't have enjoyed our stay more. The staff were delightful, our room was superb. As it was my birthday, they also made us a special dinner and upgraded us to the rooftop suite for the night. This was the highlight if our morocco holiday, and we'd love to revisit in the future.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2013,4,"Not perfect yet, but going in the right direction","The staff is remarkable here, and the building itself is excellent. Like the rest of Essaouira, it is developing compared to Marrakech, but there is a warmth to the road that is putting them on the right course. They do not regularly serve food past breakfast, but if you order in advance, they will make a custom dinner to order for next to nothing. There is a personal touch there that is hard to find.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 June 2014,4,Comfortable and charming,"We stayed for a few nights after visiting Marrakech. The Riad is very clean, cute and a good value. The staff treats guests like family with their warm smiles and helpful service. No complaints - only advice is for physically challenged travelers. As in much of Morocco, the Riad has a lot of stairs. It didn't bother us but it could be quite a climb for an unsteady person. Also the location was a bit off the beaten path. We didn't encounter any problems with safety and it isn't a long walk from the main areas. It just feels a bit isolated. However - I noticed that the hotel L'Heure Bleue Palais was around the corner from Riad Chbnante. If the area is good enough for two highly rated hotels, it must not be too bad! Thanks again to the staff for a lovely visit.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 June 2014,5,Reviews justified,"Most of the reviews of this riad sing its praises - and with every justification. Although in the medina, which is small and easy to get around, it is on the very edge which affords it a little more calm than many others would enjoy. Warm welcome and continually helpful, attentive staff - even on departure. Room was lovely - comfortable bed, superb bathroom, good facilities including a mini-fridge and even limited satellite television if one felt the urge. Good breakfasts. There is something of an air of this place being a work in progress as it is relatively newly refurbished and some minor works are still being done. Nice roof terrace with a jacuzzi. Had a look at a number of other riads for return visits but none impressed to the same extent.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 June 2014,5,Beautiful riad & fantastic staff,"We had two nights in riad chbanate and it was everything the reviews said. Beautiful inside, our room was amazing and the staff so friendly and helpful.

 June 2014,5,Thank you!,Thank you for a lovely visit during the music festival! The staff was so welcoming and helpful. We have stayed in 4 riads during our Morocco tour-this has been our absolute favorite! I would also highly recommend Essaouira if you visit Morocco.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Our Third Fantastic Visit!,"Riad Chbanate has become a firm favourite for us and we returned for the third time in the past two years for a completely relaxing week at the end of May. As usual the high quality and warm personal service was a given - nothing is ever too much trouble for the team - and the beautiful building is a real treat. As architects this is a real attraction! We have stayed in the rooms with the big round baths previously which are lovely, and this time we stayed in the new penthouse room which was great too - especially with views across the town and of the sea. We'd happily stay in any of these rooms again. We particularly enjoyed dinner in the hotel one evening - traditional Moroccan fayre (delicious!) served in a candlelight spot in front of the fire - living the dream! Fiona,…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Lovely service,"I can't recommend this place enough. Its excellent. The service was great and the rooms fabulous. Breakfast was great also. Its close to the main part of town, but away from the touristy parts. Loved the cute tortoise! The hotel even arranged a free private car for us at the last minute to urgently take us to the airport when we got our times wrong. The driver pulled out all stops for us, overtaking etc etc... We literally just made the flight, arriving at the airport as it was due to depart and after pleading with airport staff! If the hotel staff hadn't had helped with the transfer, we would have surely missed it. Thats service with a capital ""S"".",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 July 2013,5,Beautiful Riad,"I am remiss in not writing this review sooner, as we had a wonderful stay here in July 2012! From the moment we were met by the staff at the bus station, they could not do enough to make our stay a fabulous experience. We did not arrive in Essaouira until 9pm, but Samira had already spoken to us on the phone to check out what we would like to eat on arrival, & greeted us with a feast. The breakfasts were amazing, served looking out to the courtyard area which was truly beautiful & peaceful. The staff were so helpful & friendly, helping us with directions, suggestions & organising a sunset camel ride along the beach! The Riad is only a few minutes walk to the Souks & 10 mins to the beach area. I would definetly stay here again. Our room was beautiful, with a sunken bath which…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Great place to stay in the medina,"We spent 4 nights here towards the end of our 2 1/2 week trip to Morocco. It was the third riad we stayed in and we were not disappointed. Our room was on the fourth level, quite a hike up but a lovely large room with views over the medina to the sea in the distance. Courtyard area was lovely and relaxing with the dining area inside looking out onto the courtyard. We had dinner the night we arrived which was delicious. They lit the open fire for us as it was a cold evening despite it being early May which made for a lovely atmosphere. Breakfasts were very good for Morocco. The staff were excellent particularly Greggi who was so keen to assist us in any way possible. The location of the riad was also great - a little removed from the the main area but still only a 10 minute walk…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Charming riad,"Greggi the manager is an amazing person. Bends over backwards to make anything possible for you, He really added to the stay we had at this hotel. He had excellent recommendations for dinner (check out Elizir if you have time - the lamb and pear tagine is to die for!). We stayed in the top suite on the top floor and it was great. The bathroom was a knock-out: shower with a view! The bathtub is one of the biggest I have seen. However the Wi-Fi doesn't work well on the top floor (too far from the router). When it comes down to it though, we didn't really need internet in a place like Essaouira! Besides that we had a knock-out stay. Thank you again Riad Chabanate for having us.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2014,2,"""Zen Suite"" not zen! Unless you like open floor plan!","We stayed in the"" Zen Suite"" for 2 nights during our 19 days of travel through Morocco. Although, the breakfast was wonderful and the roses and riad beautiful, it was not relaxing to have 3 people (2 adults, 1 child) staying in a room with no wall to section off the bathroom. There was only a thin curtain, with a gap, to separate it from the ""bedroom"" area. As we were told by reception, perhaps if we weren't ""feeling well"", we could go downstairs to the riad courtyard and use the restroom! I don't expect this when paying a fairly expensive rate to stay at the property. Not only that, but there were windows that looked into the lovely bathroom area from the main walkway to and from rooms. Perhaps, they need to reconsider the ""zen suite"" or name it something else altogether!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Super friendly - THE place to stay in Essaouira,"Greggy, Samira and Nawal are just the best front of house you could ever hope for - enthusiastic, happy, friendly, helpful and considerate. They are backed up by a great team. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Breakfasts are great. Communal areas are welcoming. A/C and wifi work well. I would not hesitate to stay here again myself, or to recommend this Riad to others. Simply wonderful. Thank you so much!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2014,4,wonderful service - weird bathroom setup,"the staff here are the loveliest nicest people and the riad is gorgeous - and the breakfast is indeed to die for in fact is really too much (our 2nd day they asked what we wanted since we had shamedfacedly left so much behind our 1st time) - the location is great as it is easy to find and a short walk to everything in the medina our only issue was with the bathroom area in the Zen suite - there was no separation at all between the toilet and bath, and only a short curtain between that area and the bedroom - so if you don't want your travelling companion to hear and see everything you may need to ask them to go upstairs to the terrace for a while! notwithstanding the strange bathroom everything else was just perfect and greggy, noelle and samira will do everything they can to…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,"Friendly, comfortable and couldn't do enough to help","We had 3 nights in the Riad Chbanate and had a really excellent stay. The room (Chbanate room) was fantastic; very nicely decorated, very comfortable with a superb bath to complete the transition from medina bustle to the Riad's secluded peace. The team were superb and really couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The location of the Riad is slightly away from the main tourist area of the Medina but still safe and actually all the better for being a 5 minute walk away from the shops and restaurants. Highly recommended!!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,Perfectly Relaxing Stay,We have spent a truly wonderful week at Riad Chbanate. The staff have been lovely - nothing has been too much trouble. The room is comfortable and rather glamorous with it's sunken bath. Fresh roses everywhere and mint tea and cakes whenever we came back from the outside world. Thoroughly recommended.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Excellent stay in a beautiful riad - perfect place for relaxing!!,"We stayed at Riad Chbanate at the end of March 2014 for two nights after spending five nights in Marrakech. It was an amazing stay and would wholeheartedly recommend a stay here. The riad itself is beautiful - all light wood and airy. We had booked to stay in the Berber Suite but after our arrival I asked to have a look around the other rooms. The Hayate suite was available and after expressing our delight we were upgraded to this room free of charge! The Hayate suite was perfect after spending all day walking around. We had a fire lit on both nights and the bath tub is absolute bliss!! (However, it is quite noisy as the bathroom overlooks the main street outside - not a problem as there are very thick curtains). After returning to the riad around 10pm one night we requested…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,A beautiful haven amidst a wonderful walled city,"From the moment you arrive outside the walled city at the Chbanate gate, it is magical & breathtaking. If you call the riad, they'll fetch a cart to collect you with your baggage and you'll realise that there is nothing that is too much trouble for your hosts. The riad is just inside the gate and so very easy to remember your way back on trips out. The house is much like a small palace, with luscious decor. We stayed in the Chbanate suite at the top - absolutely stunning! You can bathe overlooking the city, with sunlight flooding into the bathroom - a dream! We had a sneak peak at other rooms and they all look gorgeous. The terraces and courtyard are well equipped for relaxing and the courtyard particularly lovely with its fountain and turtle, which our little boy loved feeding!…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,Expect the unexpected,"Couple meters from the Cbbanate door, this riad and its personnel welcomes you from the moment your cross the entrance. From the mint tea and the cookies they serve at your arrival, to the rose petals in your room and the amazing size of our bathroom, everything was perfect. They provided great information about navigating the streets of the medina and suggestions for dinner. They even gave us a bottle of water for the road and arranged for cut flowers for our friends we were going to visit in Casablanca.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,Fantastic Riad,"First time I have written a review and the first time I have felt somewhere was worthy of a review. This place is fantastic. Superb location and rooms are immaculate. The service was exemplary. The hosts Samira and Greggy seriously go the extra mile and will happily organise anything you need. Great coffee and juice whenever you want and the breakfast, oh the breakfast. If i'd stay any longer I would have put on a stone. Cannot reccomend highly enough. We stayed in the 130 euro room and it was perfect.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Beautiful Room and Kind staff.,"We enjoy so much to stay here. Excellent service! We had welcome tea then give us some information, some restaurants in Essauira. My husband can't eat wheat, they gave him some special yoghourt that mix nut and dry fruits at Break fast. All staff are look happy to work. We heard the owner care of them, so all staff are working long term. Good atmosphere. We met nice guests as well. Also All rooms are different design, Our room has a hammock. Beautiful bath and wall, carpets ! The wall in a rooms are so nice, beautiful, shiny, made by natural material that traditional morocco style. They polish it every month. Recommend if you want to have a romantic holiday !",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Superb place,"Phenomenal Riad! The staff was incredibly helpful and accommodating, the food was excellent, the location was great (quiet, but still centrally-located and easy to find), and the rooms were luxurious. My wife and I would unequivocally recommend this Riad to travelers.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Wonderful Friendly Service,"What a wonderful place to stay - we could not have asked for more. The rooms (we had Hyate and Berber) were amazing and Greg, Samira and Noel all looked after us superbly and were very friendly and attentive. We were sad to leave and would certainly stay here again.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 September 2013,5,Riad Chbanate,"My wife and i booked to stay at Riad Chbanate for our honeymoon we stayed for 10 days and found what we would call a real oasis within a walled town it offered a comfort ,quality ,peaceful retreat from a bussling busy. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had a gorgeous room with the most amazing bath and a terrace with a hot-tub and sun loungers. All in all we would give it a high recommendation.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2013,4,"Good breakfast, lovely staff","We had a small van take us from Marrakesh to Essauoira and the company arranged by Riad Chbanate was great--the driver was careful. The young man who welcomed us to the Riad was warm and kind. I agree with other opinions about the rooms and the bathrooms in them--my bath was heavenly. The thing I liked most was the breakfast--excellent quality. We didn't get to see the owner much--he was busy--but I did see him talking to other patrons. The riad is in the town--not right slap in the thick of things, yet only a few minutes walk--this is an advantage on noisy Saturday nights.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Excellent riad in Essaouira,This is an excellent riad. The place is top notch and the staff is super friendly. We stayed in the Mauresque Room. This was on the terrace. Huge rooms and very luxurious. Would definitely stay here again. Location is also very convenient and its walking distance from the bus stop in case you are coming by bus from Marrakesh. A bit on the expensive side.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2013,5,Short visit to Essaouria,Lovely riad very welcoming. Rooms beautiful and perfect location . Looking forward to coming back very soon. Would recommend this riad if planning a short stay as very well located and near to the coach station and beach. Lots of lovely restaurants to try and the staff as the riad will help you locate these restaurants and offer advice on where to eat and shop.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 March 2014,5,"Beautiful, Delightful Oasis","We recently spent a few days in Essaouira and had the privilege of staying at Riad Chbanate. We arrived in Essaouira after a half-day drive from Casablanca and frankly, were concerned as we walked through the streets of the old city to the riad. The narrow streets are packed with people, dusty and uneven. We rang the bell and were greeted by Greddy, a friendly, professional inn-keeper in an absolutely beautiful, accommodating, comfortable space. We enjoyed a glass of wine as we chatted about the city and the small hotel (eight rooms). Our suite was spacious and lovely, with an incredible tub large enough for six or so people. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner on our first night at the riad. The staff saw to our every need, provided detailed information about the city and made…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2014,4,Lovely riad!,"We stayed in the Hayate suite which was absolutely gorgeous! The biggest bed ever, a beautiful open fire that they lit for us on 2 evenings, which was lovely to fall asleep with, and then the bathroom...The bath is so big it takes about 20-30 minutes to fill up, and everyday they fill up the bubble bath for you, so you can enjoy the experience all over again! We had a bath every day just for the sheer enjoyment of it! The staff at the riad were all lovely and very helpful when we had questions, and organised an afternoon camel riding for us. The breakfasts were amazing as well. They were all more than happy to help with anything we needed. Having spent a few days in Marrakech, Essaouira was a good come down. The town is very relaxed in comparison, and smaller so you…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,"Best hotel, excellent staff. Not sure we'll be able to top this.","Riad Chbanate is hands down one of the best hotels. We stayed in the Oriental suite and couldn't have been happier. Upon arriving from Marrakech, the staff made us feel relaxed while they took care of belongings, made dinner suggestions. The breakfast is the best we had in Morocco. Essaouira, in general misses some details when it tourism, but Chbanate didn't miss a single detail. I would go back to Morocco just for this hotel.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,Absolutely Fantastic,"This is hands down one of the best places we have ever stayed. The service, staff and attention to every detail was impeccable. Thanks to all of the staff for making our stay so special and all of the sage advice on restaurants, shopping, etc. The Riad is absolutely beautiful and in nice quiet location with a few minutes walking distances to everything. It was so nice to be able to come back in the evening- have a glass of wine, have a few snacks, and sit by the fire. Breakfast was by far, superior to anything we had in Morocco - homemade bread, fresh fruit, fresh squeezed orange juice, local yogurt, omelets, etc. We couldn't have enjoyed our stay more. And definitely go for the Oriental room if you enjoy a decadent bath and fire in your room. Absolutely sensational. …",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2014,5,"Over the Top, Our Best Hotel Stay Anywhere","WOW! WOW! WOW! this fabulous Riad in Essaouira simply delivered on all levels. It's a 5 star hotel experience in a Riad. Greg, Nawal & the other staff couldn't have been more thoughtful, helpful, friendly & results oriented. Our room on the top with views of the ocean was superb. Nothing negative to say. We were only going to stay 2 nights & extended it to six. We'll be back to Essaouira and back to this Riad!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,A wonderful Riad - perfect for a longer stay to really relax in Eassaouira.,"This was my favourite Riad on our Morocco trip. This Riad is expensive in comparison to some of the other riads in Essaouira, but it proved to be worth it. We spent 5 days in this Riad, and it was brilliant to have somewhere so lovely, quiet and friendly to come in relax in when we were done with sightseeing/shopping etc. The room was beautiful and large, and the bathtub fabulous! But what really makes this place worth the extra money is the staff who makes the Riad feel homely and friendly. Their English was excellent, we were given a map and an explanation of the area, and there was always someone to greet us or to offer us a drink when we were in the Riad. On a lazy sunny winter morning, I fell asleep on a lounger on the terrace and a member of staff placed a blanket over me…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2014,5,Amazing Amazing Amazing,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in the recently opened Chbanate suite as part of our honeymoon in Morocco and we had a fabulous time in this beautiful riad. The staff were friendly and very welcoming. The view from our room was fantastic, you could see across the whole Medina and into the ocean. The only gripes I had and this is clutching at straws, is that in our room being on the top floor the wifi access was very limited.Also we had to put the rug under the bed as they were very slippery against the wooden flooring. But like I said clutching a straws to find fault. For anyone looking for things to do we would definitely recommend the quad biking with Essa-Evasion. 2hrs of driving through beautiful golden beaches, rocky terrain and more, this is a must. …",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,Quality all around,"This Riad - which is apparently pronounced ""shbnat"" - has international class and is highly recommended (if you can afford it). The rooms, the service, and the food are all excellent. If it's too cold to have breakfast in the ""court yard"" area, which was the case in December, there is a very cozy restaurant room next to it, with a lit fireplace! The place is tastily decorated and has a 'lounge' atmosphere. In our room there was only a curtain separating the toilet/shower from the rest, which might be an issue for some. But in return there is a nice sunny roof terrace where one can go.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,wonderful experience,"Just spent 4 nights at this peaceful retreat and would like to thank all the lovely staff for their friendliness attention and superb service.Greggy and noelle were amazing front of house and the lady chef with a fabulous smile made us an excellent cous cous with lamb and chichen served in front of the fire on request.Samir took us to a local Hammam 2 minutes away,gave us a rigorous body scrub and a massage that was passionate,strong and technically brilliant.Stayed in Room maresque with massive bath for 2,fill it up with hot water,some argon oil and soak your stesses away.Try the lovely wines french and moroccan.Thanks everyone,you were amazing and the riad full of atmosphere.Love and best wishes Jonathan and Martin",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2013,3,I don't get the love.,"I hate to rain on the parade here, but I thought this was the weakest of all the places I stayed in Morocco. The riad was lovely and the staff tried, but some unfortunate design decisions really detracted from my experience. For example, the rooms had no phone or other connection to the front desk. So, if I needed any assistance I had to walk down (then back up) four flights of stairs. I asked about this, and they suggested I lean over my balcony and shout down through the courtyard if I needed anything. I'm sure the other guests would've appreciated that. For another example, my bathroom was huge, but nobody had thought to hang a towel bar or hook where I could've hung a towel or bathrobe. There were just too many small annoyances like that, and they added up to an unpleasant…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2013,5,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT STAY,"I could not recommend this beautiful Riad highly enough. Although ideal for a honeymoon, it was also brilliant for two friends wanting to stay somewhere nice. The breakfast and the biscuits (made by Noel's sister) were great. We stayed in the Oriental room and it really was unbelievably special. I feel like I'm gushing but it was such a pleasant stay that I can't help it! The staff made it for us: they gave us great recommendations for places to eat/go for Hammam and generally made us laugh and feel welcome. Essaouria is a very traditional place and can be a little difficult to penetrate so having such incredible staff made it a wonderful experience. Thanks for a great stay! Rachael (of Rachael and Sarah!) xxxx",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2012,5,Perfect riad. Great value; fantastic experience,"Wonderful riad. Wonderful experience. Staff couldnt have been more helpful.

 September 2013,5,A delightful way to end our trip to morocco,"After a fantastic, action packed 13 days of seeing the sights of morocco from Mountains to Desert, Cities to Ruins through the great offices of our travel company, Morocco Explored, my family of 5 (all over 18) were ready for a few days downtime by the time we reached Essaouira. Riad Chabanate looked as if it was a bit out of the way being towards the back of the Medina and the street leading to it is not always as clean as it might be. But walk though the door and an oasis of calm and luxury awaits. Moreover, the Riad serves cold wine and beer which after the general paucity of said substance generally in Morocco , we consumed with some relish! Noel - the owner/manageress was fantastic; as was Greggie - both super hosts and very helpful. Breakfast was delicious and freshly…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2013,5,A little gem in Essaouira !,"We love our stay of 3 nights in Riad Chbanate. The top floor room has full access to lounging area and jacuzzi which made it very comfortable to relax around . The French owners had made the rooms and general areas very cosy and very tastefully done. They had gone down a path where you have free wifi , bottles of water and soft drinks. All the service staffs were outstanding , always willing to help in every way. Morning breakfast with crepes, local fried pratas, Danish pastries and even eggs done in any way you like, truly delicious and generous for Moroccan standard.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 August 2013,5,Absolutely Fantastic,"We came to Essaouira after 3 days in Marrakech and it was a breath of calm, relaxing air! When we walked into the Riad, we were amazed straight away. The building is fantastic. We were there 2 minutes and Noelle (apologies if I have spelled this incorrectly) offered to upgrade us to a better room for free. The room was one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in in my life. Amazing. Large marble bathtub, infinity tap, massive rainfall shower in the centre - absolutely amazing. Again. Breakfast was also great, much better than any of the other places we stayed so far (we still have 2 more days in Fes) and everyone was so helpful. Noelle and Greggi (again apologies for the incorrect spelling) were both very friendly and helpful and booked out hammam for us and a camel ride along…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 August 2013,5,One of the best place ever...,"First of all the rooms are very nice, we slept for four nights in the berbere suite and it was delicious. The breakfast excellent, maybe one of the best we had in morocco so far. Staff well prepared, english speaking and very helpful. We loved every detail.

 August 2013,5,Beautiful raid in wonderful medina,"French owned Moroccan run elegantly furnished raid. Nasal and greggy are exceptional - could not be more helpful or welcoming. Nawal took my wife to her local hamman, we learnt to cook pastilla with the chef who makes the pastries for breakfast. The medina is a trove of experiences waiting to happen.

 July 2013,5,"Lovely centrally located Riad with fantastic, friendly staff","Riad Chbanate was simply a lovely experience. It appears to have been quite recently renovated as the rooms looked newly decorated and everything was very clean. Also, for a riad (we stayed in a couple of others throughout Morocco) the rooms were very large. The bed was huge and very comfortable - i think we slept the best here of all the places we stayed in marrakech. There is also air con and satellite tv although we didn't use either! In the bathroom we had a massive plunge bath with multi-jet shower, which was a nice surprise as we didn't realise we were going to have it.

On top of this, the sun terasse with jacuzzi and sunbeds is a great spot to hang out. In the courtyard we enjoyed the delicious gourmet breakfast, snacks and mint tea (all for free) and generous glasses of wine (50dh). The staff deserves most of the credit for our good experience, their english (and french) is good and they help you with everything, always with a smile. One of the women even brought me to her local hammam (after she helped me buy all the local hammam products at a herbalist), where I was the only non-moroccan, such a great experience.

The rooms are beautifully and imaginatively appointed and a cool retreat from the town's buzzy pace. The breakfasts were delicious and plentiful, and the courtyard is a friendly heart to this classy place to stay. Greggy greeted us on arrival and he couldn't have been more attentive. His friendly, discrete service is what made this place so memorable. When we checked in (we were a party of 4) I was unwell and he was very quick to ensure I was in one of the air conditioned rooms ready to rest. He couldn't have been more helpful and throughout the rest of our stay (we were there 2 nights) he and the team proved a happy, attentive…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 June 2013,5,Relaxed honeymoon stay,"We stayed in Essaouira in Riad Chbanate for six days on our honeymoon and just loved the place. We were picked up in Marrakesh Airport without any trouble, and when we arrived late in the evening, the riad had a delicious dinner ready with a table in front of the fireplace. Our room (Hayate Suite, first floor) was amazing and very romantic with lots of ornamentation and traditional Moroccan wood work. Windows were facing the inner court with good light. The spacious bath room had a very large bath tub. Large good quality bed. A look to the small medina street from the window over the bath tub could assure you that you were in fact in Morocco. We really enjoyed the spacious rooftop terrace as well. It was both possible to stay in the shadow or in the sun. All days we had…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

The staff were so friendly and attentive. They recommended places for us to visit and even explained how the locals buy their fish from the market and get it cooked for them (which we did). We stayed in the Oriental room for 6 nights and it was lovely with rustic furniture and a large bathtub. The breakfast every morning consisted of fresh fruit salad, toast, pancakes, croissants, pan au chocolate and fresh orange juice. They also provide free bottles of water whenever you need it. There is a terrace with chairs to sunbathe or read. The trick is to find a place out of the wind! I would advise taking a thin…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 May 2013,5,A little piece of Paradis,Sadly we read the bad reviews about this riad and did not book to stay here but stayed elsewhere for two days then to be told they had overbooked the best thing that ever happened as we loaded up and decided that we would go see this Riad. We walked through the door and both my husband and myself went wow. The reception from Noalla was amazing we were offered tea while we waited as she was busy with another client. At this stage we were not sure if they had a vacancy or not but I would have slept on the floor this Riad is spotless and so beautiful. We were shown a room the bath was huge with a wonderful shower and we were told they had to finish getting it ready we were wondering what was left to be done as the bed was made beautifully clean towels and everything appeared…,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2013,5,Wonderful Honeymoon Stay,"We stayed at the Riad Chbanate for part of our honeymoon in March and we had an amazing experience.

 June 2012,5,Probably the most beautiful and romantic hotel I've ever stayed in,"Absolutely stunning place. We arrived late at night completely frazzled from a crazy windowless taxi ride from Marrakech. After passing beggars around street fires, bone thin dogs I was sooooo relieved when the giant sturdy door of the Riad Chbanate opened to reveal what looked like the gardens of a palace. I felt like I had stepped into the book Arabian nights. Roses everywhere, water trickling gently from the fountain and the gentle crackling of logs in the relaxing reading room. The guardian offered to make us food (1am in the morning) and then lit the fire in our very own fireplace. The owner a very lovely and charismatic young French men has wonderful taste and style. He told us the tale if how he left home at a young age to see the world. He has brought his vision and…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,Very high quality.,"I have never stayed anywhere finer. The facilities, assistance and cleanliness were absolutely first rate. Like most riads, there are only 7 rooms, so there's a sense of prestige and a personal experience with the staff that was just first class. Noelle and Greggy were always pleasant and interested in helping us. Their guidance was always useful, and the mint tea the best we had in Morocco. Easily the highlight accommodation of our honeymoon, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,Riad Chbanate is the place to stay in Essaouira,"We absolutely loved our Riad in Essaouira, in every single sense. The whole place is beautiful and decorated with such great taste. It was a pleasure to come back every day after our visits and have a ‘thé a la menthe’ in the courtyard or on the terrace. Our room was really nice, every little detail was special, loved the toiletries (the shower gel and the lait corporel were so nice that we bought some to bring home). The staff was very friendly and always eager to help. Greggy ‘the boss’, as the real boss calls him, met us at the Supratour station and gave us an excellent brief of the town, including good recommendations of places to drink and eat. We were celebrating our 10 years anniversary and Greggy gave us a bottle of wine! Breakfast was excellent and…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,Incredible place,"Wow. It's really quite difficult to put into words just how wonderful this place is. We stayed at Riad Chbanate for 5 nights in early April and as soon as you walk through the large wooden door you enter an oasis of calm, luxury and great service. The Riad has been beautifully restored from what was essentially a total ruin just 6 years ago. Everything feels very luxurious, authentic and well thought out. We arrived at around 2pm after travelling from Marrakesh, and were given a map and talked through the local sights, the best restaurants and general experiences to be had by the fantastic Noelle. We booked Suite Tyfina on the first floor, which was lovely. A really comfy bed, hammock and a huge bath (more than big enough for 2!). The roof terrace is really nice with…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,Tranquil corner of Medina,"We stayed with our ten month old daughter in April as the first stop on our trip. We were immediately made to feel super welcome especially by Noeul (sorry if spelt wrong) and Greggy (?). They made us feel that nothing was a problem, culminating in Greggy running up and down the stairs every 30 minutes to check our daughter was asleep in the evening. The Riad is stunning, the bath was simply huge and two of you can stretch out in it, amongst the rose petals whilst drinking GnTs. The room was great and the main area downstairs has a lovely fire for sitting by in the evenings. The medina is great and the main markets less than 5 minutes from the Riad, just ask for local tips. The breakfasts were amazing (esp. crepes with Nutella) and The staff always spoke to and kissed our…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,Best place I have EVER stayed!!,"My husband and I recently spent a few days in Essaouira and we stayed at the Riad Chbanate. it was, hands down, the best customer service I've ever experienced. The rooms are beautiful and super comfortable, the food is superb, and the entire Riad is just gorgeous. I wish that I could relocate this Riad to every location I travel to...I could have stayed for weeks. Riad Chbanate has my absolute highest recommendation!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2012,5,Excellent,"We spent 3 nights here, our stay was very pleasant, the staff very friendly, location perfect, very quiet and easy to find. Breakfast is good but could be more varied, I used to run on the mornings before breakfast and I was too hungry so... I would put more fruit on it.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,A touch of luxury and calm in the chaos of the old Medina,"Exemplary service, very attentive and friendly staff. Drinks and a snack on arrival. Beautiful room with enormous bath and shower. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast 'whenever you like' is delicious. Fresh orange juice, crepes, pain au chocolat, croissants and bread. We also had a tasty fruit salad and yoghurt - yum. We had a jacuzzi on the small upstairs terrace which was great. Meals can be requested at the Riad which can be cooked as you like, however we chose to eat out. Do not be concerned by the run down exterior on a fairly grim street, the riad is wonderful. A five minute walk gets you to centre of the Medina. Best place so far in Morocco.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2013,5,Lovely place to stay,"My wife and stayed here for five days in March 2013. It's a great place to stay, the staff are great, really great, they just seem to know exactly how to look after you, never in your face, never pushy but really attentive and really nice people. We stayed in the Oriental room, it has a very good bathroom with a massive bath, great soaps, towels and always has hot water, great way of getting the sand off after a long walk up the windy beach. The place is French owned with Moroccan staff which makes for a good combination of efficiency and friendliness. Breakfast is good, fresh and always has some great pastries with it. there are fires when it's cool and AC if it gets hot. The only negative point is the roof terrace, it's a little small for 8 rooms to share and lacks…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 March 2013,5,Superior accommodation and hospitality,"Situated within the medina walls, Jean's riad proved to be a welcome retreat from the hussle and bustle of Essaouira life. From the warm welcome including a cooling beverage through to the sublime comforting pillows everything leant itself to pure comfort and relaxation. If visiting Essaouira, Riad Chabanate is a must.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2013,5,Perfect...,"We just returned from 4 nights at Riad Chbanate. I'm pretty sure this is the best place I've ever stayed. Friendly staff and owners, beautiful food and wine, stunning room (especially the bath!) and an amazing and peaceful building. Oh, and all the mint tea you can drink, for free! We couldn't have been made to feel more welcome and would recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic break in lovely Essaouira.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2013,5,Great hotel!,"We stayed for two nights at Riad Chbanate and had a really great experience. The hotel is clean and well-kept. The rooms are very spacious and all have big tubs you can soak in. It's located on a quiet street, but still pretty close to the main sightseeing areas (though this isn't a big concern in Essaouira - the town is a 15-minute walk end to end). It's pretty small (8 rooms), so it doesn't have some of the amenities of larger hotels (e.g., pool, fitness center), but it does have a hot tub. But the best thing is the staff, who are friendly and genuinely looking to help. Their restaurant recommendations were right on, which was not the case for some other places we stayed. Also, we were three people scheduled to stay in one room, and they gave us a second room for free…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2013,5,perfect holiday,"We just back from a lovely romantic stay at road chbanate! Everything was lovely, the room was beautiful, the courtyard and the rooftop was also very nice, and staff were super helpful and made our stay extra nice. The location was also perfect, with a short walk to everything around, but still in a quiet street. Would absolutely recommend this Riad!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2013,5,perfect place to stay,"We have just had a week’s stay at the Riad Chbanate. There are so many things to like about it. The Riad is beautifully restored, with a pretty central courtyard and a nice sunny roof terrace. Our room was comfortable and attractive (we chose the Suite Mauresque) and the breakfasts were really good, with some of the best fresh orange juice that I have ever tasted! The Riad is in a good location, in a quiet part of the medina but a short walk out in the evening to the restaurants. We really enjoyed the food in Essaouira – we tried all five of the restaurants that were recommended to us on the first day: L’Elyzir, Sirocco, Caravan Café, Laayoun and Chez Sam, and all of them were excellent, as was the meal we ate in the Riad on our last night. It is also convenient for…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2013,5,Bliss!,"Oh my, how can we describe how much we enjoyed our single night here! We were given a choice of accommodation and settled for the new 'Wood room' at the very top of the Riad. An enormous bed with mounds of feather pillows, huge double bath and our own outside space. I cannot emphasise how friendly & welcoming the staff are. We ended our evening off with a bottle of wine in front of a roaring log fire, discreetly left to soak up the ambience. After a huge freshly made breakfast the following morning we were assured we could enjoy the premises for the rest of the day! Sadly we had to return to Agadir but I so wish we could have stayed longer. Thank you for some wonderful memories.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2013,4,Nice Riad,"We liked staying at this riad! Jean, owner and creator of the Riad Chbanate, runs a good operation with a nice and helpful staff. It is beautifully redone and easily accessible from the street as it is situated close to the southern entrance of the medina. I recommend it! Essaouira is a very nice and relaxed city and surprisingly unspoilt by tourists (like myself). There is fishing, shipbuilding argan oil production and carpentry going on making it a real place. Best time is spring and fall, but even in late February it was quite warm. Summer is very windy, they say.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2013,5,Perfect stay,My boyfriend & I stayed here for a few nights & wished we'd stayed longer! The staff (especially Greggy & Jean) were extremely helpful & friendly & made us at home! It wasn't so busy when we stayed & they showed us all available rooms & let us choose!!! All the rooms were beautiful & luxurious with a huge bath!!! Nothing I would change? Was very sad to leave at the end of our visit,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2013,5,Perfect luxurious get away,"We ballsed up! Having told the Riad we'd land at 15.40 and could we have a taxi waiting, on the flight we realized our mistake that in fact we'd be landing at 19.00 hours........ But of course the driver was waiting for us, the fire lit as we arrived, given food and drink even though the chef had gone home, the heater on in our room to take off the night chill and an absolute guarantee that nothing was a problem. From start to finish this amazing destination deserves every accolade it gets. Thank you!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2013,5,Sublime,"We stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon and couldn't have made a better choice. Our room was absolutely gorgeous and we ended every day in front of a roaring fire in the fireplace of our bedroom. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. I had a very bad cough and so my husband asked for directions to a chemist. The owner pointed out that nothing was open in the medina so he went off on his motorbike to a chemist out of town and brought me back medicine. Every effort was made to make our stay magical. Don't hesitate to book a stay here - we'll definitely return. And, be sure to try the freshly squeezed orange juice and croissants for breakfast!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2013,5,Great Place,"We absolutely loved this Riad. It is easy to find, the building is beautiful, the atmosphere is great, the food is delicious, the staff are really friendly and know exactly what they are doing. The recommendations we got for dining and visiting were absolutely spot on. This Riad was certainly our favourite place in Essaouira.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2012,5,"Unassuming from outside, a delightful haven inside","All that marks this riad from the outside in the narrow medina street is the front door and its sign but stepping inside you find yourself in a charming entrance hall and courtyard. The staff and management were most welcoming - I particularly appreciated the complementary beer after an 11-hour journey! My room, Suite Berbere, on the second floor was quiet, well-appointed and spacious and, although it did not have a view, it did have exterior windows, unlike some rooms in other riads. There was great attention to detail, for example, on arrival, my bathroom was strewn with rose petals. Breakfast was a treat, with freshly-squeezed orange juice and fresh breads. All staff were most attentive and helpful. All the main sights of the town were in easy walking distance, as were the…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2013,5,Wonderful Riad in a Quiet Quarter of Essaouria,"This riad was easy to find from the parking lot just outside the medina walls. The entire staff was friendly, helpful and very accommodating (they didn't mind carting breakfast all the way to the terrace for me and my wife). Speaking of breakfast, possibly the best croissant I have had in Morocco. Very much appreciated. The rooms are large, clean, well decorated and incredibly comfortable. Our room had a hammock, which was nice for reading. Great orientation and very good recommendations for restaurants.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2013,5,Best place in Essaouira.,"Excellent Riad. Easy to find, looks beautiful and our room was amazing, large and with its own huge bath. The staff were particularly helpful and kind (making us a free sandwich for the road, that sort of thing), breakfasts were a feast and I particularly liked their fire and living room. Can’t recommend this place enough.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2012,5,Gorgeous,"Staff all very helpful and welcoming. Greggy, as others have mentioned, is a star and absolutely full of information about the good and not so good places in town. The room (suite orientale) was really lovely, all tadelakt with a big open fireplace - very cosy in December. Plenty of cupboard/drawer space. A sumptuous bathroom with a huge bath. There is only a curtain and not a door separating the bathroom from the bedroom. If this is a problem for you, maybe don't book this room. Nice roof terrace (with hot tub!). Don't listen to the 3 star reviewers, this place is lovely.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2012,5,Stunning stay,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Riad Chbanate for 2 nights and had the most amazing welcome from Greggy who immediately offered us a sit down in front of a beautiful log fire with a complementary drink and highlighted all the best places to visit and recommended the best places to eat (Cafe Caravan was so good we went back twice). He couldn't have made us feel more welcome. The room, Tyfina, was so lovely we didn't want to leave. Stunning marble bath and bed, room scattered with rose petals and oils/salts etc for the bath, very romantic. In fact the whole place was beautiful. Breakfast was fresh, tasty and plentiful. Definitely enough to fill you until late afternoon and give you the energy to explore Essaouria. Essaouria was a lot more laid back than Marrakesh (thank…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2012,5,Wonderful stay,We stayed at Riad Chbanate for one night and absolutely loved it. The owner and the staff are really kind and went out of their way to make us feel welcome.

 October 2012,5,"nice, quiet and very charming place!","the guy, i forgot his name, working in the riad was taking such good care of us and made the stay superspecial with his caring emphathetic maners. Very helpful with organizing things too, he knows the best places to go for dinner! Hotel is in the old town and beautiful, a bit pricy though. Go to the Taguenza, chez Abdou, 20 min. Ride for lunch or a booked dinner!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2012,3,Just average.,"I chose this place based on trip advisor reviews & to be honest was surprised that this could be #1. We have stayed at other riads in other areas which were so much more beautiful with really warm, helpful staff who know you by name (especially because most riads only have 6-10 rooms). The room was pleasant but with a damp smell. A few basic touches missing from the room like towel holders, a door on the bathroom (not so great when you've returned from a big meal & want some peace & quiet away from others!), a cupboard to put your luggage in. Having said that, the breakfast were yum, the room with a fireplace was cosy & the rooftop terrace was sweet. Greggy, the head of the hotel staff, was so friendly & helpful. He truly made our experience in Essaouira memorable. He…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2012,3,"Nice and neat, but no extra","Nice and neat place but nothing really special compared to other riads in Morocco. Also, do not go there during the rainy season - all the top floor and the middle""yard"" are wet and couches/chairs covered with plastic. Place has a cozy breakfast room with a bonfire - a big extra during the autumn-evenings. Efficient service, but no personal touch/service (as may in some other riads have - they even remember your name etc). No cupboard in our room nor a place for two luggage.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 November 2011,5,Such a romantic riad,This was quite possibly one of the most romantic places I've stayed in. The whole experience from the candle lit evenings enjoying a drink in the center of the riad to indulging in a long soak in the sunken bath in our room. The food was amazing both for breakfast and dinner and I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Essaouira.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2012,5,Lovely Riad. Great staff,"We found this Riad through TA. Such a great find. A little way from the port and main square, but a lovely walk.

 September 2012,5,Made us feel very welcome,"Great place. The staff are super nice and can't help you enough. Room (the Hyatt room) was amazing complete with a fantastic round bath and shower room.

 June 2012,5,As good as it gets!,"Having stayed at Riad Chbanate a few months ago, we decided that we would break the habit of a lifetime and actually take the time to review somewhere we've visited. We have both been to the far corners of the world and stayed in some pretty special places but this place has to be the best. In fact, it's the first time we've been somewhere where it would be criminal for us not to spread the word! The riad itself is sumptous; an idyllic oasis in the sometimes crazy world of Morocco. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous; traditional Moroccan furniture, drapes and decor. Our room (Suite Berbere, the cheapest on offer) was delightful - particularly the enormous limestone bath - and it's hard to imagine how any of the other rooms could be better - although we're sure they are! Guests…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2012,5,Amazing stay,"It has taken me too long to write this review as we stayed in february of this year but from the more recent reviews I see the place is just as amazing! We wanted for nothing. Jean and his incredibly attentive staff did everything to make our stay sublime. From the incredible meals(we tried breakfast, lunch and dinner!) to the warm and welcoming common areas to the amazing tub, there is nothing negative to say. My husband and I have travelled extensively and this was our best experience. February in Essaouira is perfect. The sun is warm and inviting. We were surprised to wear everything form our bathing suits to leather jackets and scarves in the evening. Visit Essaouira and this Riad, you will not be disappointed.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 July 2012,5,Riad at the very best level,"On our short trip from Marrakech to the sea I trusted the reviews from TA to book a room. Afterwards it is easy to agree with all tohers. Chbanate is a great place in all measures. Service was impeccable from arranging transportation from our address in Marrakech to pre-ordered shampagne cooled upon arrival. To have the riad as beautiful as it is one must notify that the owner, Mr. Jean, has designed and built it by himself. Impressive, I would say. I also happened to lose my golden necklace in one spa nearby. I could just describe the place and time to the riad - and voila! - it appeared in my mailbox back at home soon after. Rooms are all very nice, but to have the last kick in bliss, and if you are ready to put the additional $, try to get the Hayate room. It is splendid…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

Everything about it is wonderful.thanks to our tour guide Brahim from www.moroccooverland.com!! Jean is the perfect host: charming, intelligent, knowledgable, efficient, relaxed, kind, funny... He had excellent recommendations perfectly tailored to my wife, young daughter and I (and I know from talking to other guests he was just as good at showing them suitable things to eat, do and see.) All the other staff were splendid too - often above and beyond the call of duty.

Even if the streets are busy and sometimes smelly, as soon as you enter the riad you know you are at a calm and peaceful place. The riad itself is carefully decorated, tidy and you will find a lot of space to enjoy yourself either in the patio, the dining/living room or on the roof terrace, from where you can even have a glimpse at the sea.

Noel, Greggy, and the rest of team that work at the Riad made us feel welcome and relaxed form the moment we arrived. Nothing we asked for seemed to be a problem and was answered with a genuine smile. The room we stayed in was decorated to a high standard with a huge double bath and massive bed.

The building and the decoration are awesome, they have fresh roses on every table, our room was designed perfectly, everything was very clean. But the best of all were the friendliness and dedication of Jean, the owner, and all of the stuff. For our first evening we asked to have dinner there and they lit the fire place, served outstanding food and made sure that we had a great evening. They also arranged a quad tour for us which was a great experience and an excellent way to get to know the surroundings.

Many before have given this 5/5 but its not in the same category as say La Sultana in Marrakech so I give it 4/5. The only downfall is I am a light sleeper and even with ear plugs its a little noisy, poor sound insulation, noise from the street, chit chat from cleaning staff and other guests... Our room was on the first floor at the front. Its more than adequate for a night.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

It has been built and decorated to the highest standards by the owner Jean and the service you get from his staff is absolutely first class.

When we arrived in our room a fire place was lit and all the candels in the room - small detail that made such a difference. I loved the amount of roses that were in the room- boquets, pettals, single roses tucked in on the bathrobe - amazing. Great pleace with huge cortyard, terrace with a view and a jacuzzi, easy to find and safe to stay. Staff was very helpfull and corteous, always there for you if you need anything. It was a fabouls 3 nights at riad chbanate.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

The owner- Jean, Greggy- Riad staff and a guy with glasses that did the security at night (didn't manage to catch his name- sorry!) On our arrival, unfortunately we had a mix up with our booking, in which we were double booked- due to Hotels.com However Jean handled everything flawlessly, he had arranged a night at another Riad for us, he gave us a bottle of champagne, bouquet of roses and a note (which we unfortunately couldn't understand as it was in French :( Greggy- this guy is THE MAN!!! :D Aforementioned, with the mix up from our booking Greggy walked us to the other Riad which was…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

He gives good recommendation for places to eat. A staff to keep. The owner is polite, and very sensitive guy. My partner was eating breakfast, and he moved away to give my partner more privacy. Never seen such humility in a businessman. Was already blown away by beautiful Essaouira, and the great service at Riad Chhanate is a very pleasant icing on the cake. Oh, we were upgraded to a suite, Oriental Room! Great bathtub!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

Without regurgitating the same information all I can say is that it's all true. The welcome, service, atmosphere, character, friendliness, and quality are all top notch.

 May 2012,5,Very pleased we chose Riad Chbanate,"Riad Chbanate was a lot more expensive that the other Riads we looked at in Essaouira but we really liked the look of the rooms and what we read in the reviews. We were not dissapointed. Our room ""Hayate"" was wonderfully luxurious and spacious. The public areas, lounge, roof terrace etc are all extremely comfortable, fitted to a high standard with good taste and immaculately clean. Jean who designed and refurbished this Riad from a ruin should be justifiably proud. He and all his staff are very helpful, relaxed and obviously want to do everything they possibly can to make your stay in Essaouria enjoyable. Even the turtle is friendly and very tame.

We found Riad Chabanate on Tripadvisor and decided to try it based on the reviews. We couldn't have been more happy. The staff was welcoming and helpful. The rooms were large with great flow. The bathtubs were enormous. The riad itself was very bright and roomy inside. Honestly, it's hard to describe how wonderful this Riad was. The pictures can't possibly do it justice. I'm hoping to come back soon with friends and rent the entire place for a weekend or more.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 May 2012,5,"Excellent luxury riad, top level service","We stayed at the Riad Chbanate for two nights as part of our tour of Southern Morocco. The hotel is absolutely lovely - comfortable, well furnished rooms, a nice courtyard for breakfast and a roof terrace with some shady spots for reading. The staff are excellent, eager to provide information and any help needed - nothing was too much trouble for them. The breakfast was also great, but we ate out in the evenings so I can't comment on the restaurant. The only slight annoyances are the construction work across the street from the rear of the hotel, but its not adjoining the walls so the noise is limited and the hotel also seems to like to play music in the restaurant from the breakfast service through to dinner, which is audible in some of the rooms and seems a little…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,A perfect place to stay,"My daughter and I stayed here in April 2012. The riad is very clean, beautifully constructed, and very easy to find (once you know where you are going). The staff and service was exceptional. This is a great place to stay at a great value.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 May 2012,5,"Great authentic place to stay, perfectly decorated and great service by the team","Essaouira is a world of its own in Morocco. Temperatures stay between 22 and 28 with a friendly breeze. Note that in august the winds will pick up and the sun is intense. Stay here for 3-4 days. Perfect beach and hip beach lounges. Camels, horses, quads, kitesurf for beachfun. Drinks are served yeeeh.. When you are a golfer a must do is Mogador golf by Gary Player. We played it twice. Another day for strolling about the village, very authentic without the masses you have to get through in Marrakech. Very nice fish stalls, great restaurants. Very laid back.

 April 2012,5,Best hotel we have stayed in.,"We have just come back from a week in Morocco where we spent the last three nights in Riad Chbanate, Essaouira. Essaouira is a beautiful place to stay especially after a few days in crazy Marrakech and this Riad was just exceptional in every way. The staff (unlike many in Morocco), are genuinely friendly and helpful and put you at ease. When we arrived, the manager sat us down with a map of Essaouira and spent fifteen minutes showing us where to go, recommendations for places to eat and where everything is (while we drank freshly squeezed orange juice and ate marzipan sweets...), this was really useful. The owner John, was fantastic, he had built and designed the Riad himself and as he likes a big bath himself and thinks that a fireplace in a room is romantic the rooms all…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,A home away from home in the Medina,"We booked this property largely based on other reviews here, and we were certainly not disappointed. I would like to echo other reviewers' comments about the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, particularly Gregy - it really ""made"" our stay here. The property itself is well located on the quieter back side of the Essaouira medina, so it's the best of both worlds - only a short 5 or 10 minute stroll into the bustle, sights sounds and smells of the busier parts of the medina, but also in a relatively quiet spot to retreat to at the end of the day (or to nip back to if you've forgotten something). Our welcome was wonderful - having travelled for 40 hours and arriving early evening we didn't have the energy to head out for dinner, so the kitchen made us a lovely tagine…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,Wonderful welcome,"From the moment we stepped into the riad (and Gregy lent ne 20 Dhms to pay the porter) the smile did not leave our faces. The riad itself is well-deisgned, bright and airy and very pleasant (with a lovely open fire inside). But what makes it quite extraordinary is the welcome of the staff, and the quality of the food. Gregy's obvious enthusiasm for Essaouira and life itself is infectious.Having ordered a meal before we arrived, which turned out to be chicken tagine and was absolutely delicious, we did not eat anywhere else in Essaouira. Samira's coucous is exceptional and the grilled king prawns we asked for were also amazing.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,All we hoped for,"Lovely property, nicely located in medina, very helpful staff. Also went to elizir (think sp. correct) restaurant and was wonderful.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,Even better than I'd hoped,After reading previous comments we booked to stay at Riad Chbanate and returned yesterday. I never normally write reviews although on this occasion having travelled extensively for about 20 years I just wanted to say that this is probably the the best hotel/riad I have ever stayed in. It's not only that if I had the ability to design the perfect place this would be it. It was simply stunning. No other way to describe it. However what completed it was the staff. We travelled with our two year old and they were so lovely always playing with him and smiling. Nothing was ever to much trouble. If you travel to this part of Morocco (which was lovely) then I'd so recommend Riad Chbanate. Absoutely perfect.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2012,5,"Wonderful host, very good value","We were a bit concerned before we arrived that the excellent reviews for this riad on tripadvisor might not be entirely real and accurate. Obviously that is not the case. This is a small, well-designed, newly-built riad in a quiet location on the far edge of the medina. The medina is quite compact, so being on the edge is no problem. The riad's owner/builder is a very likeable and bright young French guy. While we were there he was present and extraordinarily attentive to the needs of his guests, and his staff was excellent.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2012,5,Top place to stay in Essaouira!,"We can only recommend the Riad Chbanate! Top rooms, the owners were very nice and helpful, the food was perfect, the location was great (within the old city), you are able to walk by foot to see all interesting places. We will come back next time when we are in or near Essaouira. The riad itself is very professional styled.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2012,5,Four days of pleasure,"My wife and I stayed in the Riad for four days, and we couldn't have been more satisfied with the room and the staff. Jean, the owner, treated us like family. He even found me a Moroccan Premier Cru. Unfortunately, there's not a lot to do in Essaouira after three days. You can let yourself be blown around the beach or you can visit a restaurant near the main entrance to the souk where the magician is beyond good. Very entertaining. Thank you, Jean and your staff, for all your attention to detail We had a very relaxing time.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2012,4,Beautiful Riad,"The reviews on trip advisor matched the reality. The owners work very hard to provide excellent service and they deliver. The breakfasts were excellent (but i did have a serious sugar rush), my husbands dietary needs were met. This Riad is a leader in meeting the needs of their customers. PS the bedrooms and bathrooms are amazing. I wish them continued success and maintaining being the best place in Essaouira to stay, they deserve it.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 January 2012,5,Wow...,"... Firstly, the bathrooms are to die for enormous tubs roomy enough for two! Essaouira was our last stop in morocco and a perfect choice to end a very busy vacation with some more laid back explorations. We ended up spending a lot more time in this riad than any other, just relaxing and winding down... The town has a very chilled out vibe and panders to aimless walks and conversations over beer in the courtyard. the owner, Jean, was super-hospitable and had a lot of interesting stories to share. the staff, too was very friendly and helpful. Although they only serve breakfast ( as lavish as any moroccan breakfast), we found them very accommodating in rustling up a couple of oddly- timed meals when asked. They went out of their way to help us make reservations at restaraunts, the…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2012,5,Wonderful Riad,We stayed here for 3 nights between Agadir and Marrakech. Our room was beautiful with fresh rose petals and a gorgeous bathroom with rain shower. The staff are incredibly helpful and attentive without being intrusive and Jean the ownder was very welcoming giving advice on bars and restaurants etc. If you want to stay in the Medina then this has to be the place for you! Breakfast was excellent - we especially loved the fresh orange juice. Dinner can be done for you as long as you book in advance - there is no menu - just tell the staff what you would like and it will be served. There is usually soup and salad and a traditional tajine of some kind. Drinks are quite expensive but you are in a Muslim country and the prices are no worse than city prices in the UK.

Always happy to serve, advise or pop off and get whatever you need from the outside world. The location ideal, in the beautiful medina. The riad was rebuilt by an enthusiast and it shows in the quality of the construction. The experience is a reflection of the host jean, engaging, charming, enthusiastic and knowledgeable.

 February 2012,5,Faultless,"As my husband and I sat on the coach back to Marrakech, we tried to think of any negative points about this Riad and really struggled. The staff were very attentive and offered excellent recommendations, our room was decorated with rose petals each day and had an open fire and the town was very relaxed, safe and not too windy. The breakfasts were substantial and delicious though my husband was a little disappointed not to be offered an omelette every day! We did get fresh juice squeezed in front of us and pancakes and pastries! The Riad is on the edge of the medina so there is a 10 min walk to the main square. There is quite a bit of poverty in the town which can be a bit of a surprise when you leave the Riad as it has a luxurious atmosphere. There are plenty of fine…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2012,5,"If there were 6 stars, I would easily give 6!","There is a reason why this Riad is #1. For us, having stayed in 7 other places in Morocco, this was hands down the best. For us, this is #1 in all of Morocco! Excellent, excellent, excellent. I'm not sure where to begin. Jean, the host, is French and he built this Riad himself from a plot of land. Obviously he is multi talented and what a great job he did. It was very very cozy. It is inside the medina but next to some bar and there were some questionable people hanging around outside. A key is provided for the front door and you can come and go as you please. We stayed in the Tyfina room. There isn't a door that connects the room and the bathroom so make sure you are ok with this arrangement. The shower was great. In fact, we stayed in another property in Marrakech…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2012,5,Excellent - It Deserves Its 5 Star Rating,"We have just stayed at the Riad Chbanate for a week - 2 adults and 2 children in the Tyfina Suite. The owner organised the transfer from Marrakech for us and we were picked up on time in a nice big taxi. The Riad Hand-built by the French owner, Jean, the Chbanate is well-designed and immaculate. It would seem that Jean is to architecture and building as Bear Grylls is to surviving in the wild! He has taken the skills he has honed on his travels around the world and created a totally authentic riad - but with extra sound-proofing, gorgeous modern bathrooms and a sense of light and space. Roaring log fires and a lovely roof terrace add to its attraction. Our room on the first floor, the Tyfina, was bigger than it looked in the pictures, had a hammock, a free soft drinks mini…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2012,5,Beautiful friendly oasis,"We spent 2 nights there in February as a weekend break from the bustle of Marrakech. What a special welcome we received, with log fires both in the lounge and in our room. The staff are friendly and ever attentive, nothing is too much trouble for them. You can request specific dishes for dinner and they are delicious indeed. The riad is beautifully designed with spotless rooms and striking bathrooms.

 September 2011,5,Amazing friendly atmosphere,"We stayed for 4 nights after spending the 1st half of the week in La Mamounia in Marrakech. After the opulence of the Mamounia, we weren't expecting to be wowed, but the friendly welcome and incredible atmosphere of Riad Chbanate place immediately proved us wrong. Unlike some riads this pace is perfectly clean, very comfortable and has some wonderful design touches. It's certainly not glitzy or overly modern - but the renovation was clearly a labour of love and the relaxed atmosphere is wonderful. The bath in our room was massive - would easily have fitted 4 people! We ate one night in the Riad, but wish we had more often: the tagine was the best we had in Morocco. The breakfasts are huge, and very very good!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 December 2011,5,Book already!,"I feel lucky, and so does my wife, for having stayed at this Riad. For me it was one of my best hotel experiences (if not THE best) ever. Where to begin... perhaps the incredibly romantic, yet tasteful rooms with a fireplace. The latter not just for decoration: the staff was more than happy to light it for us, and so we fell asleep a couple of nights to little crackling sounds of the fire dying down (we stayed in December). The bathroom was amazingly big and also very pretty. A huge bath tub with rose petals, as seen in 5-star places, but this time twice as big and more beautiful. We stayed in two different rooms, and amazingly they had the same lay-out, but all the details were different.

 October 2011,5,Wow wow wow!,"What an amazing place. We were stunned by the architecture and ambience from the moment we stepped through the heavy but unprepossessing door to the street in the medina. And that was only the courtyard! It's big and beautiful, and seriously hip, too. Stunning rooms, tiered roof terrace, roaring fireplace, cool music, delicious breakfasts, excellent service. We stayed in Berbere, one of the less expensive rooms, and it was large, lovely and romantic with a huge bath big enough for two - and candles. I can only imagine that the more expensive rooms are simply sensational!

We waited for nearly an hour (nobody answered the…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2011,5,Beautiful building with attentive staff,"A very calm oasis in the bustling medina, the rooms are thoughtfully themed and attended by extremely thoughtful staff. I was particularly impressed with the high quality bathroom fittings, televisions and air conditioning units and the progressive concept of not charging for the minibar. We were well taken care of when we arrived and stopped for mint tea many times on the rooftop and in the courtyard. When we were worried about making arrangements to leave at the end of the holiday, the manager booked and arranged everything for us. The only caveat I have is that the bed and bathrooms are only separated by curtains which may not suit everyone, however there is an available toilet off the courtyard if you might need it.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

Clearly not enough time - but enough to experience the glow and delight this Riad has to offer. The room was stunning. Clean. Tidy. Feast for the eyes....Compared to our Riad in Marakech this was a palace. Beautifully designed rooms with traditional Moroccan furniture. The Bath was incredible. Rose petals. Attention to detail was up there. The service AMAZING. So helpful, polite, friendly and they even reserved a table at a restaurant we wanted to go to... The Rooftop Terrace an incredible view.

We were travelling with our 5 month old son who was regularly entertained and cuddled by the staff ( which I loved!). They were kind and helpful in every way. The Riad was fantastic. It was beautiful ( built by Jean ) and unique and good value for money. We stayed in Tyfina which we loved. The sheets and towels were changed daily and the room was well cleaned.

The Riad is beautifully built (by Jean) and our room was perfect. We had a giant bath, and a very comfortable bed. We spent some time on the roof terrace, it has a hot tub for two and space to relax, we watched the sunset on our last night. The team went out of their way to create the perfect last night for us.

We stayed for two nights (wish it was longer), it was just perfect. The riad itself is by far the most beautiful raids we have stayed at, the staff were ever so helpful, friendly and most importantly, genuine. Each room in the riad was beautifully decorated, spacious and full of characters. We had a lie-in on our 1st morning following the late check-in the night before, waking up at 10:30am and leaving the room at 11:30 thinking we had to go out and source our own brunch, but instead the staff kindly stopped us on our way out and asked if we would like some breakfast!

Restaurant recommendations were spot on, breakfast was sumptuous and the room was very very comfortable (we loved the bath!). The owners and staff clearly take great pride in the accommodation and this shows in all the attention to detail and cleanliness throughout the property; there are bowls of roses everywhere, and even a cute turtle in the fountain on the patio.

This was by far the most beautiful (architecturally speaking) Riad that we have stayed in during our three week trip. The people (Simone, Naoual, Greg) were wonderful and the breakfast and dinner were very good. It is convenient in that it is inside the Medina and makes it very easy to visit the souks, etc. and then return to this wonderful Riad. The only Riad that would match this would be the Riad we stayed in Fes which was Riad Le Calife. Definitely deserves its #1 ranking in Essaouira.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

When we were taken up to the room, after having rested, it far exceeded my expectations, Beautiful, spotless, very romantic. The breakfast was fantastic, the best I've had in Morocco.

It was a lovely retreat after each day in the busy souks. The staff were all very pleasant, Gragui was especially helpful, with tips and advise. Breakfast was lovely and of a wide variety. The decor of the riad was just so luxurious and tranquil. And showed the achievement of such high standards from the owner Jean. The only issue we had was a faulty bath tub plug, and were moved to another room. Although the second room was just as nice, it didn't have the same feeling as our first room (hayate).

I hope the excitement of the girls didn't shatter the romance for the other guests! The rooms have been designed an furnished with care and for Morocco, real attention to detail. This is not meant in a negative way. Our parents have built an amazing house in Marrakech and the finish there does't match Chbanate. This suggests Jean was fully on top of the build. The result of the labours is suites of rooms with individual style and grace all furnished and fitted out beautifully.

Everything in the Riad plays a part in creating the perfect harmony, from the layout and furniture of the place, to the lighting (both natural light and the lamps used around the Riad) and decorations, to the rose petals and glasses used in the room.

 May 2011,5,Wonderful riad - cool jazz sounds,"Spent a delightful 4 days here. A serene oasis of calm within the medina with close access to all sights. Cool jazz sounds. Check out the ""before and after"" photographs of this riad renovation and be amazed by the transformation !",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2011,5,Welcome to Jean's perfect world,"We just loved this place starting with the owner Jean's charming personality. He designed this place perfectly and he and his wife Thais were very good at making us feel like this Riad was our home. It was raining for two days which was rare in Essaouira, but we just stayed in the Riad, having wine and nice dinner, warming ourselves by the fireplace. Since Jean is French, his choice of wine and bread is perfect. There are so many kinds of bread for breakfast and we couldn't wait for it. Also Jean recommended us nice bakery which was very cheap, but French-quality. This Riad isn't gorgeous, but it reflects the owners' warm and friendly character very well so you just fall in love with this place.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2011,5,Don't look any further - it's perfect!,"We unfortunately only had one night at Riad Chbanate in March, and wished we had stayed longer here and less time in Marrakech. This Riad is perfect in every way - the welcome is warm and genuine, the setting is stunning and the atmosphere very relaxing. The rooms are gorgeous - it's real luxury in the middle of the madness of Morocco.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2011,5,"Beautiful, tranquil and spotlessly clean","My husband and I stayed at the Riad Chbanate for 4 nights in the Oriental room. I wasn't too impressed with Essaouira on arrival, however the Riad proved to be an oasis. The staff were charming and helpful, especially the guy from Casablanca and the Moroccan guy who works in the evenings. The room was totally spotless with beautiful fresh bed linen changed daily, a bath big enough to fit about 4 people, candles and countless sockets. The riad was really peaceful and I slept very well (usually not a great sleeper in hotels but felt totally relaxed here as there was no noise, it was so comfortable and so clean). The breakfast was good albeit slightly too sweet for my taste. Also, I'd have preferred more fresh fruit rather than lots of sugary cakes and croissants and the coffee…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2011,5,Charming and lovely place,"We booked a superior room which has been very, very cosy. The owners were friendly - the breakfast one of the best ones we had during our stay in Marroco - especially the homemade joghurt. Attention: Booking was with 'hotels.com' - and the hotel is not correctly marked on the map there'. Park in front of 'Bab Marrakech', enter the medina and then its a two minutes walk on the right side... .",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2011,5,Wonderful,"An oasis in the medina. We stayed for 3 nights and were delighted every moment. Everything was marvellous, the food, the common areas, our room, the bathtub, the conversations, the coffee, the rooftop terrace, Jean and Thais (and Oliver!) - Thank-you! for a wonderful wonderful stay. We could not have asked for more.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2011,5,The most peaceful and perfect road in Essaourira,Everything was wonderful - the rooms are decorated with amazing style and taste and the service of the friendly staff is delightful. A perfect haven in a great location.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2011,5,"delightful, even in the rain","Stayed with Jean and Thais for four days and it rained heavily for two of them. They are such lovely hosts. The fires were lit, everyone was made to feel very comfortable, there was mint tea and food whenever you wanted it, and the dinner served by their staff was delicious. Some of us spent most of an afternoon reading in front of the fire in the main area downstairs; a delightful refuge from the rain. The riad is such a lovely, chilled out place .... even when its raining. The room and bathroom were lovely - the photos on the website don't really do it justice, as we said to Thais. This riad thoroughly deserves its place at the top of the rankings in Eassaouira. Ate at Sirocco, which was a very pleasant experience, food was lovely, good wine list etc, and live music.…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2011,5,5 star luxury....then some!,"We stayed for 3 nights with Thais and Jean, the Catalan-French owners and were completely bowled over by the experience....we really did not want to leave. From our spacious room with lots of small luxurious touches as well as wi-fi and satellite tv (Sky News, BBC World and CNN among many others) to the lovely downstairs dining room and the sunny roof terrace, everything was picture perfect. Entering from the hustle and bustle of the medina we found an oasis of calm and were always greeted with tea and pastries. The two young owners really made the difference though with their charm and assistance, and the staff too were faultless. On the last evening we ate diner in and it was one of the best meals we have ever eaten! Go, you will not be disappointed!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2011,5,Best experience of our trip!,"Upon arrival we were greeted warmly by Jean and his wife and baby. We were offered a seat, a drink and some delicious pastries while Jean explained the map and gave us our bearings. He gave us lots of good advice and we had a great chat. We were so impressed with his friendly, honest and good humoured approach. The building itself is stunning and all hand built and decorated by Jean. Our room (the Mauresk) was simply astounding - absolutely HUGE and SPOTLESS! Beautifully decorated, with a super comfortable bed, TV, big duvet, towel robes, and fresh flower petals strewn everywhere. Also i noticed there were wall sockets everywhere - very unusual and so convenient for phone / camera / laptop charging etc. Some steps down lead to a beautiful vanity area and bathroom. The bath is…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,Extraordinarily relaxing,"Very helpful and friendly manager, as well as the staff, excellent service, they really go the extra mile. Nice ambient, chill-out music, good taste and quality",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2011,5,Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed,"We stayed 1 night at Berber room, and it was absolutely amazing. The room was spacious and individually designed, candles and rose petals were around, the bathroom was whole made from marble, but the main thing I was impressed - a fireplace which was carefully lighted by hotel staff, so we had a wonderful time and felt a very special atmosphere looking and listening the open fire, after taking the bath. The hotel staff was friendly and ready to help, with very individual approach to customers, and the breakfast also was amazing with pancakes, fruit salad and fresh juice. If I'm back some time in Essaouira, I would definitely stay again in the Riad!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2010,5,Hidden treasure - romantic riad in heart of Essaouria,"Booked this riad for 2 nightsin early December having read reviews on Trip Advisor and we weren't disappointed. Only 10 mins walk from Supratours bus stop within the medina walls, down one of the many alleyways and only 10 mins from the heart of Essaouria. The riad was simply but tastefully furnished, with a real eye for detail - every table had a vase full of roses - a very romantic setting ! Our room on the first floor came complete with its own hammock, fireplace and sofa. The bath was big enough for two (?!?) and again more roses and candles. The roof terrace had fantastic views across the rooftops to the sea and there were several loungers to sunbathe on. Downstairs in the courtyard there were plenty of tables & chairs to chose from, the cosiest being an alcove…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 June 2010,4,Excellent Riad,"I recently traveled throughout Morocco and stayed in riads everywhere. This was the most comfortable and modern. Excellent service and modern spacious rooms, which are very pretty. Location is within the old city of Essaouira. I would very highly recommend this hotel.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 January 2011,4,"Lovely riad, friendly service, amazing baths!","The riad is convenient for the Supratours bus, although a bit further than most from the centre of town and the beach. It's easy to get back to in the evening. Upon arrival the lady of the very friendly couple that run it went through in good detail where all the good parts of town were. The communal areas are really nicely furnished. The room was very nice and the long bathroom with the giant bath was excellent. Water pressure was the highest i've ever seen which was good with such a big bath to fill! The electrics were maybe not the best though with a few loose light points and i electrocuted myself touching one of the nice light covers in the room - don't think that should be live... Breakfast very nice and in a lovely room. Unfortunately during our stay i think a…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 December 2010,5,Nest to paradise?,"We had one week, 7 nights in Essaouira, staying in wonderful Riad Chbanate. Warmly received by the friendly and highly professional hosts. The fireplace lightened in the room, candlelights, luxurious bathroom, splendid bed; a beautiful and comfortable room to stay in for a whole week! We had lunch and dinners in several other recommended restaurants, but in the end we preferred the cooking of Fatima! We want to come back, with friends and family, and of course recommend it to everyone interested.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2010,5,Amazing riad,"Had a brilliant 3 night stay in this fantastic riad. Luxurious room, very friendly, helpful staff and super food. Best palce to stay in Essaouira. Highly recomended.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2010,5,Amazing beautiful hotel,"The Chbanate was a wonderful experience from start to finish. The reception from the owner was great - she was charming and welcoming. We arrived much earlier than expected and she ensured the room was prepared for us as a priority. Returned an hour later to be shown a beautiful large room with large bed and amazing bathroom - oils, candles, rose petals and snuggly dressing gowns. Good roof top terrace to view across the town. Just relaxed the afternoon away in the hotel. Good wine, great service and wonderful breakfast the next day. It could not have been better.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 November 2010,5,Wouaw! Amazing! The Best place,"Everything was perfect! We felt at home (better) instantly. Bedroom splendid.. Bathroom amazing. Bath is almost a swimming pool. Service is top! Details everywhere like fresh flowers everyday in bedroom and in the bath!! You feel that the staff is looking to adapt themselves to give everything you could expect from them. If you want to stay alone and chill they will let you. If you like to discuss and share things, they will be the best advisors!! We visit a lot of riads in essaouira.. Our conclusion: we were sure and proud having found the best place in essaouira, riad chbanate! ""Gregi"" shared with us his passion for his hometown, essaouira. Verry interesting, helpfull and super nice! A special thanks to jean and his wife.. And their mini son, marc. ;-) chbanate is a…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,Oasis of calm and charm in hubub of the Medina,"It appears as if we are not the only guests Jean has treated as if personal friends; he goes out of his way to help and enhance your stay with important advice and directions. This chic hotel is his personal project in every way and has been finished beautifully in tadelakt, (Moroccan polished 'plaster'), including hand-built individual baths in each room. NOTE the hotel's correct web site is http://www.hotel-riad-essaouira.com/ not the other one which comes up in Google searches.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,heaven behind the wooden door,"wow, this is one of the most beautiful places i have ever stayed . the inner gardens are appointed with the most chic moroccan lights, carvings, wonderful fountain, and rugs...luxurious in the first degree. the rooms are all different, but ours was the BEST. the ceilings were painted with the most beautiful motif, to match the hand painted bed and vanity. the curved hallways to the most sexy bath...wow, this was just the best. the staff was wonderful and cleaned like no other!!! when they did your room, they also cleaned all the wood the doors, did it ALL. then they are cleaning the wonderful lamps and constantly cleaning. the food was wonderful and carefully prepared by their wonderful cook. there were nooks to sit in the garden floor area, and upstairs were lounges with cool…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,Fantastic Riad with great host,"Just spent a week at Riad Chbanate and am delighted to say that it definitely lived up to expectations after reading previous reviews. The owner, Jean, is a fantastic guy and a great host- he is very hands on and makes sure that all your needs are catered for. The rooms are spacious, clean and v comfortable! I'd certainly recommend this Riad if you are visiting Essaouira.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,"Essaoiura is sea food, great beach, friendly people and CHBANATE- we loved it","Place of the highest quality! Fantastic design (!), friendly stuff and the greatest bath we've ever seen/had (we're serious here!) makes Chbanate a unique place! Once you get tired of the medina you get back to the bright open air yard of Chbanate where you can drink Moroccan whiskey and taste some of the sweet-smelling pastries. For those who will not make their minds to stay there we highly recommend at least a visit since its interiors present what's best in riad architecture design. We honestly loved that place. What counts even more is lovely stuff we met there (they also helped us a lot!). The prices are fair. What we kept in memory from Essaouira is its beach, sea food and Chbanate. Monika and Julia/Warsaw",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2010,5,"Relaxing, Friendly, attentive, smart, warm and welcoming","Stayed there for two nights and the owner looked after us guys really well. He took us surfing whilst he kite surfed, which he didn't have to do and even leant us his surfing board. It felt like we were hanging around Essouira with a long time buddy and not the manager of this luxury riad. Breakfast was the best I had in Morocco - wish I could replicate it in the mornings before hitting the the city. The Moroccoan cooks and the other guy really looked after us also they made it feel like we with our families. He kindly went and got us a takeaway the first night as everything was shut. Bathroom was too good an amazing feature you guys should all experience espicially after a long drive. Rooms were massive Great rooftop Clean I could go on forever... I could never fault this…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,"Serene, beautiful accomodations with excellent service","This riad is located within but not far from the city walls, so is very convenient. It has been refurbished with exquisite taste and charm. The rooms are large, our bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was well equipped. The breakfast was one of the best we had in Morocco. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the place, however, is the service: the owner was extremely helpful and gracious about helping us organize our two day stay, and even volunteered to take us out in a canoe to the nearby islands if we didn't find another solution at the port (we decided not to go, there was plenty else to see). Essaouira was well worth the stop: it is large enough to have plenty of interesting street life and port activity to see, but small enough not to worry about getting lost in…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2010,5,The best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in!,"I cannot praise this Riad enough! Everything from the ever attentive staff to the little touches like fresh roses in the room each day - just so lovely. The Riad is gorgeous, loved the interior and furnishings - especially the ginormous bath! The owners were really friendly - consider booking in kite surfing lessons before you arrive to make the most of the windy coast. I don't have any negative comments to make at all, though would maybe say its not the place for a large family - more of a romantic getaway!",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 September 2010,5,superb riad - wonderful in every way,this riad is absolutely beautiful and is a complete Moroccan delight. the manager made our stay outstanding. We stayed in this paradise and the food we ate in the evenings was by far and away the best we ate in Essaouira. The attention to detail paid by the owner and manager really ensured we could have not had a better time.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 July 2010,5,"""Tranquility in mayhem""","Riad Chbanate is on a tiny passageway just inside the city walls, it is perfectly positioned for the market (2 min walk) port and beach (10 min easy walk). We loved it here!! Service was excellent, everything was done with a smile. No language problems either. Our room was quite lovely, very clean and the bed was comfortable which you really need after a long day of camel riding, quad biking and galloping along the beach on arab stallions!! We also ate at the riad one evening (just let them know thats what you want to do so they can go to the market) the food was great and plentiful. I would stay at Riad Chbanate again in a heartbeat...........",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira

 May 2010,5,Wonderful hosts and great breakfast,We could not have received a warmer welcome from our extremely helpful hosts. The interior of the Riad is newly renovated and top class. The breakfast was some of the best in Riads in all of Morocco (ask for eggs). The suite has a stunningly romantic bath/shower to enjoy. I have no hesitation to recommend this riad to anyone visiting Essaouira.,Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2010,5,Loved it.,"I loved this riad. It has clearly been rennovated to a very high standard. The staff are very warm and welcoming. The room was amazing - clean, comfortable, romantic, full of gorgeous Moroccan furniture. We were in the Hayate Suite - if you can book this room do (the bathroom is lovely with an amazingly huge tub/ shower!). The breakfast was generous and more than enough to keep you going until lunch. I especially enjoyed treated myself to nutella and crepes each morning! Both the breakfast room and the courtyard are very relaxing, beautiful places to sit in. This riad is also very convenient being just a few minutes walk from the Supratours bus stop. Essaouria is not a big place so everything is pretty much within walking distance.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2010,4,A little gem in Essaouira,"We were very happy to have found this nice place in the lovely village of Essaouira. Being led through the narrow streets of the Medina, you just don't know what to expect. Then behind these big doors, you'll find a heaven of piece. A kind welcome by the friendly French and Spanish owners. The room we had was large, comfortable and clean. The best thing was the shower - I just couldn't get myself out of the big bath tub and from underneath the very nice rain shower. Breakfast was delicious - fresh juice, warm Moroccan pancakes. Minor 'minus points': unhandy place to store your clothes; already at day one the owners made it very clear that they wanted to move out of Morocco because they simply didn't like it there - not very mindful to tell that to people who are new to the…",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 April 2010,5,Amazing! What more can I say?!,"I have just returned from a one week stay at Riad Chbanate and can honestly say that it was everything I had hoped for and more! From the moment I walked through the door, it was impossible to feel anything but tranquil and relaxed. The riad itself was beautiful; very in keeping with traditional Moroccan design/architecture and the whole place was impeccably clean. Our room was light, airy and spacious with air con, mini fridge, towels/toiletries and a HUGE bathtub! The atmosphere was very calm and serene and the owners and staff were extremely charming and helpful. Also a delicious breakfast was served in the morning. I would highly recommend a stay at Riad Chbanate : )",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 March 2010,5,"Lovely riad; warm, welcoming owners and staff","Situated in the Medina this riad has been recently totally rebuilt by the owner and I think he did a great job. The central courtyard, dining room and sitting room with imposing fireplace are all tastefully done in a simple and calming style. We had a room on the second floor which was large with a big bathroom including huge bath and rose petal toiletries. Everything was very clean. The best fresh coffee or mint tea was available at any time of day and the breakfasts were fresh and delicious. But what really made the stay for us was the lovely owners and staff, we found them very warm and welcoming and proud of the riad. I would definietly stay there again.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
 February 2010,5,Charming is their middle name,"Gorgeous is the only word to describe this. We just walked in as we passed by which never happend before as the owner told us. I saw another riad and a hotel but both could not coup with this hidden secret. Breakfast was excellent made by the chef with the baked eggs as requested, we kept eating as we did not want to trow all that good food away. Unfortunatly our stomach were alle filled up. Pluspoint, relaxxing bathscrusb, showergels etcetera and spacious good designed room! Love to go back some day.",Riad_Chbanate,Essaouira
