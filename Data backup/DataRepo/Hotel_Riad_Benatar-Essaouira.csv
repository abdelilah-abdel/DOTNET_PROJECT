 May 2017,5,Beautiful traditional Riad!,"Just completed a 2 night visit from Marrakech...So lucky to find this little gem... & such good value! Right in the middle of Medina & only 2 minutes walk from the SUPRATOURS bus depot.

We'll definitely be back soon!",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 March 2017,4,Not bad,My stay last year at Riad Ben attaar was OK. Quite and clean and nice roof terrace. I had a good night sleep in this place. Its right in the middle of the Medina. Close to everything. Its great by its location and nice staff that works there.,Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Very comfortable and clean,"Spent 2 nights late December. Room was on the second floor with a bit of ocean view. Quite. WiFi was good, beds very comfortable, hot water and good pressure, clean. Breakfast on the roof was excellent. (Had a hard time getting a cup of American coffee but, as we soon learned, we had a hard time everywhere. No coffee pot in any room anywhere.) Staff was welcoming and attentive.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 November 2016,2,Disappointing experience,"Instead of the Junior Suite we had booked for 3 nights we were put in a double room with two seperate beds. No explanation or apology, instead we got told that the wrong room wasn't their problem (who's is it then?). After several unpleasant conversations we finally got the suite we had booked for the last night, however we had to pay the full price for the suite for 3 nights. Location is great, but there are so many other Riads in the area that you will easily find a better one for the same price. Breakfast was good, however it's almost impossible to enjoy it on the rooftop terrace as there are hundreds of bees flying around, immediately converging on food and drinks. Very disappointing, we cannot recommend it.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 November 2016,4,Very good hostel,"Very good, excellent sea view from the terrace. Friendly staff. Keep the bathroom door closed, the plumbing smells a bit. Also, ask for a room with a window toward the inner quartyard to minimize the sound from the mosque.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 September 2016,3,"Not superb, but more than average","This rias is not fantastic, but worth the cost. it is located in medina, but please note that Google maps does not give you the correct location. You need to walk forward 300m more than Google maps shows; actually it is quite easy to find this riad as it has quite a big signage outside. all you have to to is just keep walking straight. the room was clean, and breakfast was served with egg (most riads serve breakfast without egg..). one disadvantage is the prayer sound in the morning; it is quite close to the mosque, and you will wake up at 06:00 in the morning due to the sound..",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 September 2016,4,Nice hotel in the medina,Lovely hotel in the middle of the old medina. It is clean and the staff are very friendly. Anything you ask for they are happy to help with. They serve you tea on arrival and we're happy to serve us tea at the end of the stay when I asked. Breakfast is served on the terrace which was very nice and there is a great view of the beach (when it isn't cloudy). It is possible to walk everywhere and there are a lot of restaurants and shops nearby. We were not overly happy with the location of the hotel due to the smell in the streets each time you walked to and from the hotel. On the last two days we had no hot water however the hotel was very very apologetic and were doing everything they could to fix it which we really appreciated. We had a decent size room on the 3rd floor with a…,Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 August 2016,4,It was good,"The hotel was nice, affordable, and convenient. The staff members were very nice. However it wasn't as clean as it should be and rooms were so small that you have to push furniture to open the wardrobe. The breakfast was great (scrambled eggs, tea or coffee, orange juice, bread, butter, orange/strawberry jelly, honey, cake and very thin pancakes) the breakfast was served to room which was so nice of the staff. As I mentioned the only issue I found was cleanliness and furniture placement.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,A Real Gem of a Riad,"One of the best riads I've stayed in; lovely renovated rooms with a really comfortable bed and plasma TV.  A tasty breakfast on the terrace overlooking the beach. Plus Ayoub and his team are super friendly.  I would happily recommend, and will be returning myself.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 July 2016,3,Simple and efficient,"This is a nice hotel and what we paid for it was a fair price. The only downside that we noticed when we arrived, was that it smelled like it was closed for a long time, but after we went out they cleansed the room well and we couldn't notice anything. I would recommend it.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 May 2016,2,You get what you pay for,This riad was very reasonably priced and we discovered why - it was not very clean or well maintained. 8 days before arrival and 5 months after they had confirmed our booking they emailed us to say we would have to move to another hotel for our second night as they had given the whole riad to members of the press who were there for the music festival. As it happened the second hotel was conveniently placed for the festival parade but we had to walk back to the Benatar for breakfast. Riad Benatar was very basic and not as clean as it should be we had to ask twice before we were given towels and for water glasses. Breakfast was very good and Good position and easy to find once you find your way to Bab Marrakech.,Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,One word: amazing!!!,"The room was sparkling clean, the reception area was quiet, the staff were super friendly, the price of the room was reasonable, the location was excellent. We loved our stay there and would highly recommend the hotel to others.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,Perfect from the room to the staff,"The reception area is very cute with a fountain and a good smell of roses. The room as super clean and it was very well decorated. You have clean towels and tv. The wifi works perfectly in the room. The rooftop is magical with view to the sea. The breakfast is also delicious! The location is very centric, although the small street might be a bit ""scary"". They gave us some helpful information and booked our taxi back to marrakech's airport. overall, great experience",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 March 2016,4,Exceptional service,We were disappointed on arrival as we requested a deluxe room and got a simple rather smelly room with dodgy electrics but which had a sea view - on the top floor. The hotel staff did reassure us that hotel was fully occupied and we were promised a room change the next morning . We did get this and it was so much better with a better sea view and no smell. We arrived at night from Marrakech to find the restaurant was closed but the helpful hotel staff went out to get us a takeaway. A good breakfast on terrace which did get visitors from seagulls and wasps. Seagulls were entertaining but does get a bit chilly there. Breakfast not really varied. Great location of hotel and for the price well worth it !!!!!!! Hope to return for future visits.,Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 March 2016,5,Excellent stay at Hotel Riad Benatar,"My stay at Riad Benatar has been really good! Staff was profesional ( i have to mention Abdullah), rooms were clean, breakfast was good, fruits in the room, central location at the Medina, bio spa recommended. Definitely the best place to stay in Essaouira!!!",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 December 2015,5,Great Riad in a Great City!,"I would highly recommend this riad if you are staying in Essaouira. Beautiful rooms, great breakfast and very good service! My sister and I loved Abdullah at the front desk who was amazingly friendly and helpful and answered all our silly questions! The location was also wonderful, near all the shopping and cafes in the city and yet on a quiet street so you don't have to hear all the pedestrian traffic from the busy area. All in all, we stayed there for 3 nights and were very very pleased with our choice. Would I recommend? As I mentioned earlier, absolutely YES!",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 January 2016,4,Great location,"This hotel is in a great location in the medina in a quiet street. The foyer is quite dark but rooms are clean and bright. 350dh for double, 400dh for bigger room with couch. Rooftop terrace and free breakfast and heaters in the rooms. We didn't stay here as they didn't have enough rooms for our group but we looked at about 8 hotels and thought it was the best option in this price range.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 November 2015,5,Gratitude for a Great Stay!,"A great find on a last minute stay in Essaouira; one of my favourite places I visited in Morocco and the same could be said of Riad Benatar. Unassuming, charming, clean and central. The white washed walls, polished cement and colourful tills in the main reception give it a welcoming calm feel. I also really enjoyed much of the art work around the rest of the upper floors and original feel of the building, which has a simple classic feel to it. Our room and bed were all exceptionally comfortable with the same subtle charms, with a great shower! (very welcome after a long bus/taxi journey that afternoon via Chefchaouen.

 November 2015,5,Excellent riad in a wonderful city,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The rooms were clean and tidy, the staff were very friendly and we had all the services we needed.

 November 2015,4,Fab,"Just back from 3 nights at Riad Ben Atar. It's a fab place to stay, good location, just inside the medina, near the port and beach as well. Would definitely recommend and is great value for money. The owners/staff are very welcoming, everyone is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,Lovely riad in the medina,We were pleasantly surprised by this riad. Unfortunately there was an initial mistake where they showed us into one of the rooms overlooking the street which was damp and noisy with no view. We explained that we had booked a sea view room and they moved us. The second room was a huge improvement with a wonderful view. The inclusive breakfast on the terrace was lovely. My advice would be to pay a bit extra and go for the sea view room. Otherwise this is a charming riad in a great location within the medina. The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful.,Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 October 2015,4,Pleasant suprise,"I stayed in this hotel through a 3 night/ 4 day tour - I was here two nights. When I walked in, I was really nervous. The lobby is rather dark and just so so. When you go into the courtyard, its the difference in night and day. I had a room on the ground floor that faced the courtyard. My room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable and there was a large corner couch and mini bar. The bathroom was very clean with nice towels and plenty of hot water. You have to ask for a hair dryer because they are not in the room. I had dinner in the restaurant and I had a salad with terrine of chicken. The food was very good and the service was excellent. Breakfast was a little weird because they just brought things out. I don't like to eat white bread and sweet cakes and…",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 September 2015,3,Well Situated,"The riad was well situated within easy walking distance of the shops and sea. When we arrived, we used a local porter to carry our bags as the location inside the medina is a short distance from the car parks and as we were on a 16 day trip we had quite a lot of luggage. We were welcomed with the ubiquitous mint tea and as the place was quite quiet I got to choose our room from a selection. I like light and air so I chose a street facing room with a window. Many of the rooms face into the central area and have no windows onto the outside world and seemed quite dark. Our room was small with not much space to put our baggage but we managed. It was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was tiny but served the purpose. On the downside, the volume of the morning call to prayer and…",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,"Fresh, clean, bright and cozy","This is the place that gives you the maximum value for money: service is incredible, terrace view is gorgeous, food is ok, rooms are clean, fresh and have a nice smell, beds are comfortable.

 October 2015,4,"Very nice hotel, nice breakfast, great view from the terrace, kind staff.","A very comfortable and clean hotel/riad- the advantage over traditional riads is a window in the room and bathroom, so you can have some fresh air to breath. Good breakfast and the view! great! the location was good, easy to find.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 September 2015,4,Enjoyable Stay,We were very pleased with this hotel.It's very convenient situated in the medina but it's tucked away on a quiet street.We stayed for 5 nights.All staff were friendly and the people on the front desk all spoke excellent English and were very helpful and made us feel most welcome.The rooms were clean and breakfast was a feast. The only issue we had was when we came to pay the bill.Because they charge in Euros and then convert to Dirhams it was more than we were expecting and their credit card machine wasn't working which meant we had to withdraw cash which was a pain. Having said that we would not hesitate to stay here again if we are ever in Essaouirra.,Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Beautiful and comfortable hotel,"Nice hotel, very friendly and helpful staff. The location is ideal, as it is right in the city center. Breakfast was so good, traditional moroccan breakfast. We stayed in the rooms with seaview which we recommend to any visitor! We will be back :)",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 July 2015,3,Average hotel~good location,"Riad Benatar is centrally located with good access to the shopping, restaurants and sights of Essaouira. The riad is very basic but very clean. Our room was at the front of the riad and it was a bit noisy with the hustle and bustle in the lane way. Breakfast was average. We would recommend this riad for a short stay as the location is convenient.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 January 2015,4,Good location,"This was a good getaway after traveling to Fez, the desert, and Marrakesh. Quiet and peaceful. Nice room with three beds for the 3 of us. Because it was January, it was cold. And the open air of these riads made it very cool. We asked for a heater in our room and we got one. We had to leave early to catch a bus to Casablanca, so breakfast -- up on the roof in the open (cold!) air -- was pretty rushed. The people there was nice and helpful.",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 December 2014,5,"Clean, warm, perfect","Was so happy to find this riad after a bad experience elsewhere . I walked the streets of essoueria asking to see the rooms before I booked....my main reasoning being that I had been so cold in a previous riad and wanted to find a comfortable room. This hotel had clean sheets with a proper duvet and they brought me a heater too ( which I didn't need in the end ). I would definitely return as the price was very good for low season and matched the cold, damp, dirty riad at 30 euros a night. Highly recommend! Didn't love the breakfast but did fill me until 4! Which I actually regret as then I could only eat another 1 meal a day!",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,“Perfect Location and Stay”,"my wife and i stayed here on 25th September it was a very pleasant stay, very nice room, nice views, nice location, and absolutely loved it! the hotel is ideally situated for exploring the Medina and the souk: you really get the flavor of the local culture.The riad Benatar itself is an oasis of calm with a sunny roof-top terrace where you can chill out.the breakfast was wonderful/traditional and very friendly very helpful very nice staff. i recommend it, we would definitely go back and even stay for longer period. special thanks to reception team and all staff!",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 September 2014,4,great location,"This riad is on the edge of the medina so it is very close to walk to all the tourist areas such as the bastion wall, the beach and the shops. The medina itself is easy to navigate with some straight streets as well as the usual maze like smaller streets. The staff here are all very friendly and welcoming. My room was comfortable & clean with a view towards the beach. Higher up on the terrace, where a good breakfast is served, you get a better view of the beach. Arriving late, I decided to try their chicken tajine for dinner and it was tender and flavourful. There is no A/C in this hotel but it is not a problem since it cools down at night, being near the ocean. There are even thick comforters on the bed. The ensuite bathroom had very good water pressure in the shower and…",Hotel_Riad_Benatar,Essaouira
 May 2014,4,hidden treasure,"A hidden beauty! we just walked the streets of Essaouira, looking for a hotel, and accidentally bummed into this hotel.

 May 2014,5,"Clean, quiet and cheap","Simple and relatively inexpensive hotel in the heart of Essaouira. Recently refurbished, quiet at night, despite being a riad, clean and welcoming.
