It was just amazing, the food was great and not really expensive, the chef is great and present nice menus. The rooms are really comfortable, and spacious. The personnel is really gentle and at your every needs.

 July 2019,5,Wonderful Stay!,"I stayed in Villa Diyafa and I can clearly say that it was one of my best stays ever. The interior was beautiful, the service was outstanding and the food was delicious. The staffs were friendly and helpful but the butler Houssam was one of a kind. He made sure that our stay was smooth and brilliant, and went out of his way to assist us for everything which made us feel very welcomes and comfortable. He is an asset to the property and for that we are thankful for his services.",STORY_Rabat,Rabat

 July 2019,1,Cancelled my booking two days before my stay,"They cancelled my reservation two days before my stay leaving us without a place to stay in a foreign country. We had made the reservation two months in advance and all they did was to send a curt email saying that they will cancel because of ""local impediments"" and that we should reach out for further details and assistance. No solution / alternatives were provided which is really a terrible form. When I called they said that the general manager is ""very busy"" then that he was not there and that they couldn't accommodate us in another room because they were fully booked, even though there were other rooms available according to other booking sites. Not sure what to believe what they are saying anymore but they clearly don't care. Very poor experience and I will never look to…",STORY_Rabat,Rabat
 July 2019,2,Broken reservation system,"They were overbooked when I arrived, and said that their reservation system had been experiencing technical problems. I showed them the reservation on my computer right on their own website... but all the rooms were full and it didn’t matter. Said they reported the problem to IT. If you book with this hotel make sure you speak to them on the phone and confirm your arrangements—don’t trust their own website. They also never reply to emails at their reservation email address, which is very poor for a hotel of this supposed quality. I’d have given them only 1 star but for the fact that they were friendly, helped me get a roo m at a different hotel, and paid for the cost of the taxi to get there. I appreciate all that but there’s just no excuse for a broken reservation system…",STORY_Rabat,Rabat

Excellent welcome and reception . Beautiful, discreet and serene surroundings . Malika , the lady who did the hammam was very skilled , professional and did everything with excellence and integrity.

The tagines were excellent but one would have been enough for us to share with all the extras that were given to us. The freshness of the ingredients was apparent in the flavours.......so delicious!!! No liquor is on the menu at the restaurant however one can order a drink at the bar. Breakfast was the same.

This made the experience really memorable for us. Having been to Villa Diyafa a few times, the welcoming exclusive feeling seems to be one of the hotel’s most unique features.

 March 2015,5,"""A beautiful and memorable stay!""","A beautiful and memorable stay which I had from 10th March - 13th March in Villa Diyafa. A small but very trendy hotel, contemporary design, cozy and private atmosphere. Staff are so well trained, they are welcoming, respectful and discreet hospitality service was truly impressive from all levels of staff and the top management. High tech of electronic lighting, music and heating system was a great eye opening. The management is paying so much attention to the details. Excellent bathroom amenities, high quantity tissue paper and bed linens. Delicious turn down amenities and cute little luggage bench for your hand bag in the restaurant, magnificent Moroccan cuisine and excellent Spa service! Will certainly come back again!",STORY_Rabat,Rabat

 December 2014,5,Very beautiful hotel,"We stayed there for one week and it was heaven. The personnel was very friendly and helpful all the time, the rooms are big, affectionately furnished and very well equipped. The Spa was also very nice. But what we liked most was the privacy of this little boutique hotel. During our next trip to rabat, we are going to stay there for sure!",STORY_Rabat,Rabat
 November 2014,5,"Nice, but expensive!","Only 10 large, very comfortable suites with high ceilings. Enjoyed the Library with honour bar and fire place. Restaurant and bar attracts the local community (ambassadors, business people, GCC investors, etc.). Beautiful!",STORY_Rabat,Rabat
