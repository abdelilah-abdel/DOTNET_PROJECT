 January 2023,5,Attentive and super helpful staff,"I was surprised how attentive and helpful the staff were. Offering assistance wherever they anticipated we needed it, and when we asked for help they bent over backwards to offer solutions and help. Even though the outdoor swimming pool had been closed for the winter they even opened it up for the two of us to spend the afternoon by the pool in the winter sunshine. We couldn’t ask for any more from the hotel and it’s staff. Having also paid for Club Lounge access we really felt welcomed by the serving staff and the variety of food and drink available was super! We will use Hyatt more often for our travels.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2022,5,Phenomenal Stay,Stay Report - 12/29 to 12/31 Location: The hotel is well located in Casablanca.  It's in a pleasant area of town with several restaurants around it as well as a tram stop and a big flea market behind it.  Red Taxis position themselves right out front so you can always get a ride somewhere too.  It's an easy drive to the mosque or the beach or any of the sights you want to see.  CMN is about 30 minutes away with no traffic but more accurately about 50 minutes if you drive during the day.  Hotel: Despite being an older property the hotel is extremely well maintained.  There's a gorgeous lobby with a library themed bar just off it that also has a limited bar menu.  Next to a Cartier store is another restaurant which has indoor and outdoor seating.  There's an outdoor pool around…,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2022,5,Family suites are amazing,"As we only spent one night in the hotel, this isn't an in depth review. I'll say that the family suites are really great for a party of 4-5. They combine an executive suite with a standard room to create a suite that just works. 2.5 bathrooms, central living room, lots of desks, and privacy when needed. The concierge service was certainly the cheapest that we received in Morocco, and the French cafe was delicious. I'd stay here again.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2022,5,Hyatt Casablanca - superb stay,"I travel with a group of 21. This was our last stop after travel all over Morocco. Started from Rabat, Chefchouen, Fes, Merzouga, Quazazate, Marrakech, Essouira and finally Casablanca. We stayed only one night. Wish we had stayed longer. Check in was fast, receptionist Omar, was efficient and accommodating with switching rooms. Dinner in the hotel - service was beyond excellent. We had a private room. About 7 staff served us.

 December 2022,4,Good business hotel in Casablanca,"My experience at the Hyatt Regency in Casablanca was very good overall. I spent four nights at the hotel. My biggest negative was that they allow smoking in the restaurants which made it very unpleasant to have meals at the restaurant. The general manager was great. He checked with me on several occasions to make sure my state was going well. If I go back to Casablanca, I would probably try a different hotel just because of the smoking but if you do not have an issue with that the rooms are very nice there. Staff was excellent. The breakfast was very good in the bar restaurant was a lot of fun to hang out in. The location was good. You could easily walk to different places for shopping as well as dining.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2022,4,Not worth the $,5* hotel. Comfortable rooms. Terrific service. The breakfast bar which is the only choice is ridiculously overpriced $30! The only food during the day is at the bar and it is awful! Overpriced as well. They cater to business groups so when you go to the pool there can be large conference group dining next to you.

Flight got pushed back a day so we ended up spending an extra day in town. This hotel was a very nice place to relax at the end of a trip. The staff were all very courteous, Seddik in the Club Lounge is a gem of a human being, one of the very best staff members I've ever interacted with over the years. Rooms were comfortable, location very convenient especially to visit the Hassan II Mosque. There's a lovely, large pool tucked into the corner of the property.

 September 2022,5,Excellent Hotel right in city center.,"I stayed at 4 Seasons Casablanca & at Hyatt, & Clearly Hyatt is Much better, 4 Seasons Hotel is waste of Money with not much friendly staff or a very good Location & more expensive. Hyatt location cannot be any better with the old city & Souq/Medina just across the street, & all kinds of transportation right at the doorstep. Its French Restaurant is also good with reasonable prices. Room was perfect, very clean & nicely done. The only suggestion I would make is to have Smart TV apps installed in the TV. It gives you a complicated process how to do it with your cell phone I tried several times but could not, if they would directly install Smart TV apps in TV that would be easy. The hotel is at least 1 hour drive from Airport due to congestion & traffic so keep that in mind…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

They grabbed a female colleague in the lobby and it went sideways. Then when I tried to get an apology they refused. I checked out early…. But literally they grabbed my bag in the lobby and put it back in my room. No apologies to my colleague or me. I don’t care what their beliefs are, but when you put your aggressive hands on someone for your belief it’s fundamentalism. They put their belief in front of my business meetings. I have no confidence in bringing a female colleague their. And most my business is with Women.

Door is broken Old furniture and torn Stinky Smelly towels with spots of dirt or something nasty. Carpet cigarette burns are everywhere Torn furniture is so visible Even the ice for soft drinks is dirty not clear 🤢 I’m so worried about my safety in this hotel after writing this review. When you enter the hotel you feel you are in the right place, but afterwards you will feel the old and worn out hotel. My advice to anyone is to try the hotel for a day or two and then decide if you will stay for the whole trip.

Great location to walk to lots of things in Casablanca and we felt safe walking around this area as two women (also nice the hotel is gated and have staff on 24/7). They will also call you taxis if you want to go to the mosque or airport etc. Rooms were heavenly with big fluffy bath towels & robes. Separate toilet to bathroom and big bath tub to soak in. We had a higher level room with view of the mosque that was stunning. Pool is huge and was pretty quiet even though we went on a weekend.

On enquiring at reception, we were told the pool was open. After some baffled phone calls, the manager eventually told us that they had sent someone to unlock the pool for us.

Concierge helped with that process immensely and we did not even have to leave hotel. Concierge brought a nurse in to do it. Excellent service! Breakfast was very good, but a little underwhelming.

We really want to thank Yassine for all the help he has done while we stayed there!!! We arrived on the day when Morocco closed border to any outside country, which we didn't know anything about it. After we found out, Yassine helped out for us to find the way to go back home. Since the county was supposed to close for next 14 days, he found us for nearby apartment. Called all the train, ferry, airline for us to find out what can be done. Without his help, it could take us much longer to go back home if we could. For the hotel itself, it is very nice hotel.

 November 2021,2,"Not what I expected from a Hyatt,","This hotel is not what you expect from a Hyatt Regency. When we arrived to check in, we had to go looking for someone to help us unload our luggage from the rental car. We later found out the there is no valet and that you must park your own car. Once inside the hotel the gentleman checking us in asked if I wanted two rooms, since it is illegal for unmarried couple to share a room, even though I requested one room for my wife and myself. The lobby of the hotel is nice, but once we arrived on the 5th floor the hallway was dark and looked like it was stuck in the 1950's. In the room there was a smell of cigarette, (even though I requested a non smoking room) and there was a cigarette burn on the carpet.

After traveling all day, we arrived at 10pm at the hotel for a one night stay and we didn't get to our rooms until 11pm. As a Hyatt Globalist, I always get suite upgrades but the manager at this property Leprou Pascal refused to give us the suite upgrade. There were at least 7 suites available at the time of our check-in. My daughter slept in the lobby for 45 minutes because it took me so long to check-in.

After the promo period ended, we were offered a package that included breakfast and dinner, and were generally just treated quite well during our 2-week stay. While there were some extremely inconvenient issues with our plumbing in the suite, to the point we needed to move suites. To our disappointment, the issues continued.

 October 2019,4,Very nice hotel,"First, the staff is wonderful an that makes for a good experience. The hotel is high end appearing with a very good feel to it. There is attention to detail and a nice feel to the place. Rooms are a little tight, but still quite nice. The hotel is busy and some fleshing up is needed in a few areas.

 October 2019,2,Nothing to Write Home About,"Aside from the location, this Hyatt has little to offer. The rooms were clean, but the hotel is somewhat run down.

 October 2019,1,The worst experience in Hyatt or any 5 stars hotel ever,In general the hotel's hygiene is disgusting: 1 -there were cockroaches in the breakfast area 2 - the hotel corridors stink of sewage 3- the condition floor/carpet is disastrous 4 - the lunch experience in the lounge was disgusting: i was served a salad with rotten and very old vegetables. the cutlery's smell was horrendous ( I had to change it two times) and the hygiene in the lounge (sofas and floor) was filthy. 5 - The staff's general dress code and demeanor was poor to say the least and attitude even worse.,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

All the personnel were very courteous and always helpful. The rooms were huge. And they were clean. The beds were very comfortable. But I felt the hotel was old and half renovated. The cookies at the entrance tasted fresh and was a huge plus. Breakfast was okay but not worth the price. Too many options outside with delicious pastries and coffee for much much cheaper. I was not happy with the toilet though. It was separate from the shower area. The toilet was so tiny that u cannot use the doors without touching the walls. I stayed in 2 rooms and both rooms had a problem with the toilet size and doors.

I asked to change some bills but they told me they had run out of cash. The next day I got a tour through the hotel, I asked them if I could charge it to the room and they said yes. After the tour was over with, they charged me 8% because I wanted to charge it to my room. I told them that I was never told that, but they still charged me the 8%. I asked again, to change some bills and again I was told that they had run out. When I aked them why they never had any bills- she relied ""Sir we are not a bank"".

 September 2019,5,Good hotel and good service,"The rooms are large and comfortable. Breakfast was very good - try the amazing Moroccan pancakes. The hotel has restaurants or venture out to the local places within walking distance. In fact, the hotel is walking distance to the souk and the Hassan II Mosque. The staff here was excellent however the waiters and waitresses need more training. The other issue is that you do not have access to the refrigerator in the room if you want to leave a bottle of water and you must give a credit card to the front desk. Also there is a musty odor in the halls and the hotel needs a bit of an uplift. That being said, I would definitely stay here again.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 July 2019,4,The best business hotel in the city I guess,"As compared to other heritage cities in Morocco, Casablanca is a bit bland; there isn't much to see except the second largest Mosque in the world which is within (bearable) walking distance from Hyatt. Hyatt is located in the centre of the old; although there are some new 5-star hotels coming up in the newer part of the city near the port area. The old city is more accessible and convenient. I didn't use much of the facilities of the hotel because I stayed there for only 3 days, there isn't much to explore in Casablanca. My only comment on Hyatt is that it is value for money by international standards. Room is clean and services are good; i.e. I got what I expected without any hassle.

 July 2019,3,Typical american hotel,"The Hyatt Regency Casablanca is well situated downtown for business. That is, in my opinion, what this hotel is good for, is a business hotel. Otherwise, I wouldn't stay here. It is directly across the street from the old Souk, but if you've been to Marrakech or Fez, you don't need to go to this souk. We had a room on the concierge level. The club serves a nice breakfast and nice afternoon snacks, so you don't need to go down to the restaurant unless you want something bigger or more. Housekeeping provides bottles of water in the room.

There are things I would change, but you can live without this. E.g. you cannot open the window, because somebody built a drywall balk above the window, or the toilet door is opening inside (cannot imagine if somebody is falling off inside, how they can open it), or the breakfast is served on low-level tables (quite uncomfortable).

One of the conceige was very dismissive when we asked for some information regarding restaurants. He was curt n dismissive. He only recommended one eatery (it was nice but we wanted alternatives ). The other incident was in the hotel's cafe. We ordered french toast and couple of eggs. After 10 minutes they brought us plain toast. It could be the waiter misunderstood our order but after another 10 minutes, no sign of the French toast or eggs.considering the cafe only had a few customers at that time.

He told us to walk behind the hotel to La Sqala restaurant. But we got lost on the way through the medina and finally walked back to the hotel and grabbed a cab. The first concierge was not very clear with directions. We met Handit, another the concierge later at night and he was more passionate and helpful over the first concierge. We asked him to help change our train ticket to first class to Marrakech and he went above and beyond. He even circled and showed us on a map how to walk to La Sqala restaurant.

We went early so some of the stalls weren't open yet, but it was still fun to walk around and look at the different wares being offered for sale.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,3,Nice Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in its common areas, bar and restaurants, but we stayed in a Club level room and I was not impressed. The room had a strong musty smell, and the carpet was probably as old as the building – these rooms are in serious need of an upgrade. Despite being a Hyatt; I don’t believe the room was up to Hyatt standards in other countries; the room was very small with two tiny beds. I realize rooms and beds are smaller in other countries, but I would think a chain as large and well-known as Hyatt would make an effort to have their guest rooms be as spacious as possible regardless of the country. The food in the Club Lounge was just OK – not nearly as delicious or plentiful as I’ve experienced at other Hyatt Club Lounges. The front desk staff were friendly and…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,4,What a difference a team makes,"I had such an amazing experience with the team at the Hyatt Casablanca. Mr. Houmiri especially was very attentive, made me feel at home and was always welcoming as if I were a family member. I also had great service at breakfast with Asma and Abdelkabir. I want to thank you so much for making my stay special. The outside of the hotel is nothing to look at. I was actually a little worried when I saw it. But once inside the lobby is very welcoming in wood tones with a fire place. The rooms are average. Though the bed is very comfortable. The Moroccan restaurant is very good and the musicians were great.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,3,Bathrooms are weird,"I found it very odd that our king sized bedroom had a see-through door for the bathroom. There wasn’t enough privacy. Also, the toilet was in a small separate cubicle which was not connected to the bathroom. There was no sink in the area with the toilet so you would have to walk all the way across the room to wash your hands after using the bathroom. This was very inconvenient because if the other person in the bedroom was in the shower and you had to use the toilet, then you would have to wait to wash your hands",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Honestly no other hotel can compete with their breakfast, Liège waffle, madeleine chocolate orange flower, brioche with pink pralines, Iberian ham, selection without gluten ..... incredible and it is renewed every week ... Hyatt Regency club lounge is really a big plus for loyal guests, a great time to relax with colleagues and / or guests I've been coming to Casa for many months and the Hyatt Regency is the only one to offer 2 upscale restaurants, one room Brand new gym, a large outdoor pool and a hamman / sauna included in the price.

 February 2019,4,Good Business Hotel in Casablanca,I have been staying at the Hyatt for my business travel for many years now. The rooms have been renovated but the shower needs to upgrade. Still has the old fashioned hot and cold water separate knobs instead of shower mixer. The breakfast has undergone a change but feel the old style was better.

 January 2019,3,Amazingly disappointing,"A grand building located not too far from the Hassan II mosque and the souks. We arrived and struggled up the steps at the entrance of the hotel with our luggage. It must have been an entertaining sight since the staff were looking at us through the glass doors without moving a muscle. Glad to have made their day. Seeing how welcoming the staff were, we asked for a smoking room so we wouldn’t have to keep going to the lobby. A smoking room we got, with a very active smoke detector. The alarm went off and in the midst of my ear drums bursting, I called the reception and they told me they will call someone. No one came. So we waited out the alarm. For the longest time. It made me realise how much my ears were able to take, and how much we forget to enjoy the silence.

 January 2019,4,nice location- property allows smoking in the lobby,Seems the norm in Morrocco is to allow smoking inside the buildings. If you can get through the smokers the rooms are spacious and comfortable. Club access is very nice and the happy hours make for an enjoyable evening. Reserving a view of the mosque was a good choice. If you have the hotel get a car for the airport make sure they have discussed the payment with the driver in advance. We asked for a car to be reserved and they pulled a taxi off the street. Made for a very unpleasant ride when he berated us for more money the entire time to the airport.,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2018,4,Hyatt Casa es mi casa,"We stayed here for a night each time transiting into and out of Morocco, and were totally satisfied with our choice. Especially since we were traveling with a two-year old. The hotel is very plush, with a fabulous lobby and very hospitable staff. The rooms, while pretty small for the price we paid (and the only reason why we wont give all five stars), were comfortable nonetheless. The location of the hotel couldn't be better: right across the medina gate. The tram stop is also just across the road, which can take you to the train station easily. The square in front is very happening on weekends. The breakfast was absolutely royal: fabulous dining area with an incredible choice of food. I would honestly stay here for the breakfast alone.

 January 2019,2,Low service mindset & Not recommended to go with children,"The hotel itself is modern and nice and is situated in a convenient location. Rooms are large and well equipped. Breakfast buffet is fine as well. The issue with this hotel is the poor service mentality. For example room was available much later than promised (1,5 hrs waiting in stead of 30 mins mentioned at check in) and non cleaning of room during day (housekeeping had tried at 09:00 when we were still asleep and room was locked from inside, which they took as a sign that we did not want our room to be cleaned that day). However most disappointing was the fact that we were staying there on New Year’s Eve with two young children. We wanted to attend the dinner that was organised but menu was not at all sutable for kids (lobster, dishes incl. alcohol etc.).

 December 2018,5,Incredible staff,We stayed for two nights at this property and were blown away by the service. The property is very nice (room was great and exactly what we expected from pictures/description) but what sets this hotel head and shoulders above others in the area is the staff.

 December 2018,2,A bad choice in Casablanca,We were in Casablanca just for one night at the beginning of our group trip to Morocco and location is everything when you have only one night to explore the city. This hotel is located away from the beaches where the Four Seasons and other nice hotels are. Besides that the room was smelled mold and dated. It was our tour company that made this bad choice.

 December 2018,3,Heart of the city,"The property overall is very good, nice rooms, good service and decent buffet spread. Located in the heart of the city meant that you have the pros and cons - the real Casablanca comes to life just outside the hotel. Crowded, flea market on the street, traffic is a mess and filthy.

The rooms were clean and comfortable. The Club Lounge provided a nice place to relax while grabbing a snack. We had lunch in the lobby restaurant and the food was very good. I had the seafood pasta - highly recommended. The only drawback is if your room faces the ocean / mosque and if on a weekend night, you might hear the young adults yelling in the streets after the clubs close (around 3am). If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room on the other side of the building.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The room was large, the bathroom and separate shower a real pleasure and a comfortable bed with large pillows an added luxury. The full breakfast enough of an offering to keep one going for the whole day and the coffee a real bonus after the offering at the riads. The wi-fi in the room took some time to connect on all our devices. The staff from porterage to concierge to reception and housekeeping were all friendly, efficient and a credit to Hyatt. other than breakfast, we did not use the food and beverage facilities, but the hotel is so well located that we opted for a little more local…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The lobby has a dark decor with many seating areas that work well as a meeting point or a place for a quick coffee before going out to the bustling streets and the adjacent old medina. The room was great in size, spotless, and offering great sleep quality and excellent bathroom size and amenities. Tried the three food outlets; Bissat for breakfast was perfect in quality but poor in varieties, Dar Bida for dinner is a must with all its Moroccan cuisine options and the French Cafe M that was top by all means in terms of creativity and taste.

 October 2018,4,Nice hotel but not worth the price,"Stayed here for almost a week for a conference. I’d have given it a 3 but the staff were super. The hotel has some nice attributes- lovely pool; helpful, multilingual staff; well appointed rooms; plentiful bottled water. Beds were very comfortable. I liked the decor- pictures of old Casablanca in the common areas, various shades of white in the conference rooms, Moroccan touches throughout w/o being touristy. The negatives were that no matter where you stayed it was noisy- on one side of the hotel there was a band playing until 11 pm every night on the plaza and on the other you were woken up by the call to prayer early every morning. The windows seemed to block out very little of the noise- Not ideal for jet lagged business travelers.

The Moroccan restaurant also offers Moroccan music and a belly dancer - very welcoming to the weary traveller. The selection of Moroccan wines was very good and not expensive. The French Brasserie is also one of Casablanca's top restaurants.

This has been nicely done! The bar has a lot of seating arrangements, some of which are just a little bit uncomfortably crowded and close together. The back part of the bar doubles as the breakfast venue. This is a nice touch: it really makes the this big space lobby-bar-restaurant the beating heart of the hotel.

We asked for twin non smoking room and they gave us a room that was dirty, hadn't been cleaned, Stains everywhere, lights didn't work and could hear drilling. Changed to a smoking room which was much more upgraded and clean. Didn't smell bad of smoke. The problem is the street noise is immense. A concert took place in he square the 3 days we were there that went on till 130am which they didn't warn us about or do much to control. For a 5 star hotel you expect to be able to sleep in it which was not great due to the noise.

We couldn't taste the Moroccan restaurant because ... It was closed!!! We were offered to have dinner in the lobby but we kindly refused.

 May 2018,3,Check your bill!,The room seemed clean although I found 3 pubic hairs in the bathtub! It was a good sized room with sufficient space to accommodate my large suitcase on a bench. There was an armchair and footstool and a long desk area. One entire wall was windows providing a view of the mosque in the distance as well as a busy shopping street. As the room was on about the 3rd floor and the window was not double glazed there was considerable traffic noise at night. The bed was comfortable and was made up with nice sheets.

 June 2018,4,Good for business,"Service was very good, staff was friendly. Breakfast buffet is pricey without offering very much at all. The hotel is very centrally located so it's easy to get to different stores and restaurants. It's great for business but if coming for pleasure, there are other, less expensive alternatives. Don't be turned off by the metal detector you have to walk through to enter the hotel....there's a consulate nearby so security was always around.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 August 2018,5,First class stay,The staff is lovely. The room is spacious with big windows. Important for me is that the air conditioning works and is not centrally controlled by the hotel. Adjustable in the room. The pillows are the best. I am tempted to nick one. The pool area is perfectly acceptable for a hotel in the middle of a city. Much happening outside - so it feels lively. WiFi is a bit iffy - but that is not specific to the hotel. I like it and will be back next week.,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 June 2018,3,Got a great deal on a club room,"We went to Casablanca during club room renovations and scored a deal where we could enjoy dinner and breakfast for only 17000 Hyatt reward points - which is a complete steal. However, the rooms were, very interesting, in that all the bathrooms were one way mirrors and not very family friendly in that regard. (Do NOT recommend for families traveling with children). Our view, however, was fantastic looking at the square and evoked what I would imagine as images of turn of the century Shanghai.

 June 2018,2,Disappointed,We stayed for two nights. Although the security was excellent we were very disappointed in some of the food and service. If you have any allergies or dietary issues don’t go as they are awful at dealing with any issues. Although staff can speak some English they do not understand when you are asking things and it became very difficult to get someone to help. Concierge was hardly ever there and when asked they would just send you to someone else rather than help as we had expected. Food was okay but not great. Our dinner the second night came with burnt bread and was subpar. The French restaurant was very good and they were good at accommodating allergies. The beds are really hard and by the end of the second day all of us were having problems.

 May 2018,1,Like rude & incompetent service? The Hyatt Casablanca is for you!!,"Never and I mean NEVER have we received such horrendous service! I cannot speak to the service of the hotel. My review is strictly on the bar-restaurant on the main floor that we received May 27/18. We arrived at about 4 pm and asked if we could just have a drink as we noted the tables were set. No problem. We had to move to another table as thoughout the bar they have machines pumping out the smell of potpourri which is revolting and so not in tune to a world that is going towards a no-scent policy in offices, etc. Is there mildew or some other odor they are trying to cover up?

Comfortable bed, pillows just the right balance between soft and firm. OK but not great blackout curtains. The bathroom in this suite had a separate toilet area. The bathroom had all the usual amenities. Fluffy bath towels. There were four free bottles of water included with the room. We had a pistilla in the Moroccan restaurant, it was excellent.

Eventually caught her attention and ordered the second beer again and asked for the bill. When the bill arrived discovered we had been billed for three beers - which at €8.50 is not a huge deal, but still, not something to just gloss over.

Moroccan restaurant was also very good. Rooms are laid out very nicely and are really comfortable. Cons: The street noise is incredible. The windows are not double pane or noise proof.

The restaurants and bar were great and the service was outstanding from the bellmen to front desk and concierge. We wanted to take the tram to La Corniche and the concierge had a bellman walk us out, buy the tickets and put us on the right one.

Offers alcohol in their beautiful lounge. Our stay wasn’t long enough to try their restaurants but I think we would have enjoyed that too. It’s in a great location. Our room was on the 9th floor and had a great view of the United Nations Plaza.

 December 2017,3,"Compared to other Hyatt hotels, the room layouts need improvement","This hotel is typical of the Hyatt hotel: excellent location, good staff. However, the rooms themselves may be typical in design for Morocco, but atypical for Hyatt: a small, cramped toilet room separated from the bath. This toilet room barely has room to open the door inwards, and one must practically hug the wall to open it from inside. Why is this separated from the main bath? For hygiene, one must walk to the bath/sink room anyway. An added inconvenience is the electrical system -- apparently one needs to read a manuel to figure out the master light switch. So, in the middle of the night you need to go, you flick on the light switch near your bed, and ALL the lights in the room turn on, disturbing your partner. Why not have a lighted light switch right next to the toilet or…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,5,Best choice in Casablanca,"I am frequently travelling to Casablanca and always stay at the Hyatt. The rooms are beautiful, well maintained and very clean. The luxurious and elegant lobby/bar give an added value to your visit. The service is not always quick, but very nice. Food is excellent in all restaurants. If you have the chance to stay in a suite, then it will be a once in a life time experience. My valuation: best of Casablanca",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,4,Best breakfast in town,"We only came to have breakfast and were not disappointed. Really nice selection of fresh food, fruits, juices, breads etc. Very friendly, responsive staff.

 November 2017,5,A fabulous Hotel with Amazing Staff,"We stayed at the Hyatt and were extremely happy with the central location within walking distance to the Old Medina shopping markets. Our rooms were very clean, with updated bathrooms; the beds were very comfortable. Casablanca is a very busy city of 3.5 million people and this location sees a lot of action/ performers at the square across the street. Having said that the most important part of the stay was that we felt very safe there once we entered the Hotel gates. We would definitely recommend this hotel. A special thank you to managers Ludivine Ughetto and Abdellah Rida El Idrissi. Both of which went above and beyond their duties to accommodate us and take care of our party.

 April 2017,3,Too Expensive with less upscale realm,"Overall The hotel is certainly one of the nicest hotel in Casablanca. Other Western chains are around (including two Starwood properties), but the Hyatt is the hands-down winner in terms of exclusivity and class. Situated in the Place des Nations Unis, it is within walking distance to just about everything in the city, including the main city center, the Hassan mosque, the Old Medina (right behind the hotel) and, if you don't mind a little stroll, the Maarif area. Is the hotel worth $500/nt like they often charge? In my opinion, no. The Sheraton or Le Meridian right down the road will give you more-or-less the same comfort for half the price. But, if you are really loyal to Hyatt or staying on behalf of a client, the Hyatt is a very nice facility. Common Areas Superb.

I am on a business trip and monthly I will stay at least 3/4 times in 5 star hotels.So I do have a good reference , if I may say so. Cleaning,front desk and various service staff are all very friendly , however I do believe that the management is very stingy and tries to make a buck out of every occasion. It goes to such an extend that this is in particular visible in the behavior of the security staff, if you take drinks with you from outside the hotel in a bag ,they will tell you that this is not allowed and take your drink away, however since there is no legal basis for diss proprieting ,they return it to you after you complain to the front desk.

The best example of their service can be summed up by this. We had left an item at the hotel, and they offered to drop it off all the way in Marrakech. Unbelievable for a $ 10 item, especially since it was unsolicited. The rooms were nice with great views of the Hassan mosque. The regency club is spacious, with a nice evening cocktail hour with champagne. Security is always present. Their front desk staff are very helpful and knowledgeable.

This is still up to now the best 5 star option in Casablanca. The location is good (Not far from the Train Station) and to the key Casablanca centric locations. The area is noisy, but so is Casablanca, Hotel is doing its outmost to bring it down with soundproofing, but you do get awaken at night by Taximen fighting at the exit of Hotel Night Club or due to random night annoyances. All restaurants are outstanding. Breakfast is great (but expensive). Service is good and staff is always very supportive. Front Desk, PR Manager, Concierge.

It was expensive, yet worth every penny. I loved the live singers and musicians, the decor was really beautiful (like a tent) and the food was delicious.

 June 2017,2,Overall we were very disappointed!,"We stayed at Hyatt Regency Casablanca for 4 nights while we visited the City on our holiday. We chose the hotel for the central location, the large swimming pool, and the 5 stars. Unfortunately we were disappointed with our stay. It's a large, old hotel with traffic on all sides. The rooms are poorly insulated so you get the heat and noise of the city. Our first night was very uncomfortable as there was a concert in the square opposite the hotel that kept us awake until about 1:30am. The antiquated aircon in the room made a lot of noise but produced very little cold air. We complained in the morning and an engineer fixed the rattle of the aircon, but the room was still very hot for the remaining nights. The noise continued to be an issue due to the outdated windows.

 June 2017,5,Great views and helpful staff,"Stayed here overnight after a long journey. It was a great place to relax and unwind. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They certainly accommodated our needs and helped us find the train schedule, a menu in English (since our Arabic and French aren't great) and just made us feel incredibly comfortable!

I asked for a handicapped room so as not to have to climb into a tub and had both a shower and a tub. However, the beds were hard as were all beds in the hotels we stayed.

 September 2016,5,We felt like celebrities!!!,"My mom and I have done lots of traveling and stayed in many hotels in many cities of the world. I have to say this is by far the BEST hotel we have ever stayed in. I honestly do not know where to begin. Let's start with the rooms. The rooms have excellent views. One side of the hotel faces the Medina (old part of the city) and the Hassan II Mosque. The other side offers a view of the modern part of the city. We got a chance to experience both views because in the middle of our trip we went to Marrakech and spent two days there, coming back to Casablanca and checking back in the hotel again and this time ending up with a view of the modern city. Both are awesome! The breakfast was superb. Their fruit juices are really good.

And not just the ordinary Hotel lobby food! Much better. Staff are attentive and friendly. Rooms are clean and bathrooms are decent size w walk in shower. Very few English speaking tv channels and no english or american newspapers in the hotel - that is not impressive. The hotel has style and you feel well taken care of.

Unfortunately the chef had already closed the kitchen. We were then escorted to the restaurant bar which had a very nice and full menu (not just snacks) and got food and drinks which we were all delicious. I had a delicious burger and my wife had half a chicken with mashed potatoes. The next day we were granted lounge access and the manager of the lounge was so pleasurable and had us laughing at his jokes.

Yassine, the concierge, was extremely courteous and could not have been more helpful to us. Every time he saw us, he was ready to assist in any way he could. Best concierge service we have ever experienced!! I recommend arranging your airport-hotel transfer service through the hotel. The hired drivers are courteous and the cars are very nice and comfortable. We selected the Hyatt for its location and convenience.

 April 2017,3,Weekend in Casablanca,This hotel is richly furnished and decorated and has two good quality restaurants and a nice pool area. However it seems to be more of a business hotel than for holidays with lots of corporate functions and events. We stayed at the weekend and there was very little atmosphere and the restaurants were almost empty. The pool was not really set up for sun bathing and the bar and lounge areas are dark. The selection of food available in the executive lounge was disappointing although this is a brighter room on the 8th floor to sit and enjoy the surrounding views. Our room was very comfortable and well equipped with a great view of the grand mosque. Despite being on the 10th floor the noise from the road below was unbearable with car horns blaring late into the night.

 April 2017,1,Do not stay Hyatt Regency; skip Casablanca on your tour,"Upon arriving at the Hyatt Regency staff were confused about the details of our online reservation. When we tried to clarify, they were defensive and did not take our feedback. The concierge service was equally unhelpful. On the first night we asked directions to locations around the hotel. We received a vague, ""brush off answer."" the next day, the individual handed us a map while on the phone with another client, waving us away without an explanation. To note, there are certain ""classes"" of bookings for the hotel - per the prices listed on their website.

The views from the upper floor rooms are exceptional. But the staff starting with Rita at the reservation desk to Handi (sp) in the lobby just go above and beyond in every sense of the way. This was the 7th and last hotel in our 17 day tour and we were exhausted and sick by this time-but the positive attitude of the staff really elevated our appreciation of where we were and not to waste the last 3 days of our trip in our room but to go out and enjoy the city of Casablanca. The breakfast buffet, the room service and the concierge as well as lobby and security staff treated us like rock stars.

Bathroom's door is glassy and you have no privacy in there. During my stay elevator went out of order for several times. So we had to try the stairs that the door of the emergency exit didn't open properly. Staff were trying to be helpful but they didn't know enough english.

They gave us a terrible room in the 2nd floor (plenty was available though). The door of bathroom don't close, material not well maintained overall. Things I appreciated were the atmosphere at the club, and room service.

Lobby is a little tired, but we enjoyed a light bite in The Living Room. Fitness center is small but doable. No spa, but we found one close by. Rooms are a good size and the a/c works.

 December 2016,4,"NICE BUT ODD ROOM, GREAT PEOPLE","Okay, so i was here with my family and we checked in with wonderful people at the desk. We got up to the room and it looked so nice! One design flaw that I think is just a european/african (not american) thing was the shower door was clear, but that is common and not a problem. The door to the bathroom was also clear! This caused discomfort in the room, as no one could be on that half of the room while someone was showering for risk of breaching their privacy. The views were excellent, as we could see the Grande Mosque. The food and restaurant experience was lovely and I would love to stay here again if I could!

 December 2016,5,Luxury in Morocco,"We had booked a night at the Hyatt prior to beginning a 3 week OAT tour and after the stress of 30 hours of traveling and list luggage it was the perfect decision. I was greeted warmly and professionally after my midnight arrival and the hotel kindly charged my credit card and paid my taxi driver in cash. A pretty nifty arrangement for non-Uber taxis who only accept cash. Our room, 906, was paneled in rich ribbon mahogany and beautifully furnished. Beds were extremely comfortable and appreciated after a long journey. An arrival snack of fruit and biscuits greeted us, as is the custom in most Arabic lodging. Power outlets were plentiful and there was a nice working desk. We had upgraded to a view room and it was worth it.

As in all hotels some are better than others / in need of maintenance. The first room was not clean - used dental floss on the floor. The second room also at the front of the hotel overlooked the hotel's construction. Big machines drilling so noisy room at all times. I then moved to a room facing the back / mosque.

The first time, all was excellent: the room was spacious and sparkling clean, the bed and pillows were super comfy, the elevators were fast, the hallways quiet, the breakfast buffet was outstanding (the best we had in our 2-week visit of the country). There were 2 free water bottles in the room. Then, we got room 429 when we returned 14 days later. It was the filthiest room of our tour. Something wet was fermenting and oozing out of the carpet onto the marble floor of the bathroom. The bad smell was limited to the area near the door.

The location of the hotel is ideal at the centre of Casablanca & next door to the outdoor markets. Its right in the middle of the hussle and bussle. The hotel has some nice restaurants, bars and a nightclub which I frequented. In one of the restaurants later in the evening you could watch ""Belly Dancing"" which was something different for entertainment. If you are looking to stay at this hotel, I would book it now.

We gad dinner in the Moroccan restaurant of the Hyatt Regency - a truly dreadful ""vegetarian tagine"" which consited of frozen vegetables warmed up with butter in a tagine dish. Cost was $19 for this farce. Next we had a meal in the international restaurant in the Hyatt Regency. The food was fine.

 November 2016,5,An island of tranquility in a sea of traffic and business,"We had acquired enough Hyatt points from their co-branded card to stay for a night at the Hyatt Regency as we passed through Casablanca. What a wonderful experience! Gorgeous, old-world tranquility with a large, quiet lobby and bar area, dark wood and subdued lights, and dozens of intimate nooks where you could carry on a business or personal conversation. The bar had reasonably priced drinks, and some free appetizers which showed up at our table as if by magic. We shared a bottle of Moroccan Chardonnay, which was surprisingly good, and took in the ambiance. One note: for those who are bothered by smoking, there is no apparent relief. Many people smoke, and the ventilation system doesn't do a good job of pulling the smoke out of the bar and lobby.

Indeed a puzzler.,"I was not a member of Trip Advisor when we stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Casablanca for one night while part of a group tour last January 2016 but now that I am I wanted to remark on a design feature at the Hyatt that has puzzled me since that stay. The room we were in was very nice—clean, comfortable and up-to-date. The bathroom was in a separate, small room, which is not very convenient as you do not have access to a sink should you need it. However, the real puzzler was the see-through glass door for the tub/shower/sink area, remarked upon by earlier reviewers as well. The door to that area faces the bed, at least it did in our room, so 1) there is no privacy by virtue of both the glass door and its location, and 2) if you use the bathroom and then turn on the light to…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

As said, otherwise still a fine hotel. Given the age of the building, Hyatt should pay extra effort that the quality remains high inside (outside, it looks outdated anyways, but this is not important to me really).",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

I searched online and found the Hayyat to be the newest in that area. I moved from the old style 5 star to the hayyat. I can say that this hotel makes you feel that it's 2016. New Style. Nice clean rooms. Great service. The guests are high class and some are on business trips. They have a nice night life in the weekends. The price is high comparing the other 5 star hotels in the same style. I am not sure if this hotel is ok for kids. Over all I will stay in this hotel in my next stay.

 July 2016,4,Very Classy,Very comfortable rooms as expected from the Hyatt. Great location too!

The beds are also very good and pillows soft not the Moroccan hard as cement pillows. The lobby is lovely but, some of the seats are ""sat out""! The hotel is quiet. There is excellent security in place. They have great bell men.

After entering the room, we noticed the carpet was wet and called reception to report the issue; we talked to Saida [Team Leader Front Office] who took action immediately: a technician came to check for the cause of problem and found a leak coming down from the ceiling at the room entrance. Then, we saw the Hyatt Regency team in action: Saida escalated the issue to the appropriate level, called us back to inform we were going to be moved to a different room and that we had been granted access to their Club Lounge!!

The first two of us arrived early and had to wait for quite a while for one of the staff to come and take our order. When the waitress finally arrived she showed a lot of attitude when my husband spoke in Moroccan to her. She only wanted to speak French (we are in Morocco after all!) Very odd but we ignored it and carried on. Then, when one other of our group arrived and was sitting for at least 15 mins, I went to one of the staff and asked if it they could please take our order, I got a shrug for an answer. Then another of our colleagues arrived and I caught the waitress's eye and asked her to come and she shook her head and shrugged again.

I had called beforehand and arranged for an airport pickup and asked the hotel to arrange for a driver to Rabat the next day. The friendly, professional and efficient staff had followed up and all went according to plan. Our room was spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable.

Don't get me wrong, for downtown Casa this has all the facilities and security you need. But it is horrendously overpriced and leaves you feeling very ripped off, with drinks more expensive than London or New York. A round of 5 drinks for almost €100 including €6 for water or €8.50 for Red Bull. Seriously?! The ""temporary"" gym has been temporary for years now.

Clean room, spacious, with a large and fully furnished bathroom. I've tested both restaurants and they were great. Only two small points: when arrived I approached the staff in English (I don't speak French) but the guy continued to speak in French with me. May be in an international hotel like Hyatt there should be more attention to people not speaking local language. I need to say he was the only one I met during my 4 days there.

The wifi in the hotel is good too. Both times we were upgraded to a suite, which were very nice. The executive suite especially is wonderful and big. Both suites were comfy, with amazing beds, new flat screen TVs, safe, and Nespresso machine. The automated minibar is annoying though (especially with a kid and if I just want to store some of my own drinks). Also, the furniture/fixtures in the rooms are mostly old and need refurbishment. The airco/heating works fine for cold air but didn't provide heat as we experienced some of the colder days in Casablanca at the end of winter. We ate once at the buffet breakfast and it's amazing.

The hotel front desk said' no go'. Retired to my room sadly. Again the next day i asked and was told 'dont go'. Sad. My room was great, well appointed, good soaps etc. Internet was quite fast.Breakfast was adequate if unremarkable.

Was delighted to enjoy a plate of oranges and macarons when we entered (better than any oranges we purchased ourselves in various souks). - Big bath, big separate shower. Toilet was in a separate little room, far from the rest of the room, so a lot more privacy from each other than we had in any riad earlier in the week! Nice amenities. - Lobby is tastefully done and we enjoyed a glass of wine one night. Reasonably priced. - Good wifi. - Walking distance to the smaller train station. Probably even walking distance to Hassan II Mosque (maybe 20+ minutes), but it was raining, so we cabbed it. - The area is a bit seedy in terms of restaurants, etc - but we found a decent local place within a few minutes walking of the hotel.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2015,4,Well located superior hotel,"The hotel is well located on the United Nations Plaza in the center of Casablanca. It is a large, white, bland, rectangular building whose cracking exterior plaster, particularly at the end, reveals its age. To make matters worse, an absurdly discordant entrance canopy in faux Graeco-Roman style has been added to the front. This tacky structure looks as if it was salvaged on the cheap from some sword-and-sandals epic in the film studios of Quarzazate. Once you get inside things improve markedly. The public areas are modern, sleek, and handsome. Check-in is efficient, with staff who speak fluent English and who are unfailingly courteous and helpful.

Breakfast was not included in my rate so paid extra for this, surroundings nice in an Arabian style with as you would expect plenty of choice and a chef on hand for omelettes etc. We ate in the hotel one night and the food was excellent.

Banks and cafes so near. We loved to sit in those cafes for hours sipping Moroccan Tea and watching the crowd pass by. McDonald and KFC just opposite the hotel as well other eateries. Room was good spacious and window opened to the front road side. Comfortable bed and good toiletries in bathroom. One odd thing is the WC is separate from bathroom. Just close to room entrance. Bathroom has cubicle as well the tub. Breakfast is awesome. Fresh orange juice and cut fruits. Omelette of choice. Moroccan bread with usual loafs and cakes. Best to end with Moroccan tea which I found the best in Morocco.

 June 2015,4,Very nice but rooms and gym need refurbishment,Old looking but located right next to the old quarters. Nice staff particularly the concierge. Breakfast was a bit confusing as they always wanted us to go somewhere else. Rooms had great view and insulated from outside noise. Sound proofing between rooms was not so great. The carpets in the rooms needed replacement. Food was ok but there are such amazing options in the city that you should venture out.,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 August 2015,5,Staff Appreciation,"To whom it may concern, We recently visited the Hyatt Hotel Casablanca, and we wanted to share our praise for the staff at the hotel. My husband and I arrived on the evening of August 17,2015 for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. Royal Air Maroc informed me at the airport that my luggage did not arrive, and I was worried that this would spoil what was supposed to be a special night. We were greeted at the front desk by your wonderful personal relations manager Fatima. She not only checked us in smoothly, but after hearing it was our anniversary, she graciously offered us a room on a higher floor with a view. She helped us make special plans by arranging a table for us at Le Relais de Paris, an amazing restaurant on La Corniche. Fatima also helped me do my hair…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The room, as requested, had a view of the Hassan II Mosque and the sea, was was spectacular and I was offered an early check in. Oddly, there was no storage or drawers anywhere in the otherwise lovely room...which made no sense, since there was plenty of space, just poorly designed. Tiny closet, with tiny shelves, no dealers anywhere...very strange. Very nice amenities, nicely replenished, plenty of extra bottled water. I made use of the Club level privileges which were definitely worth the extra price at this hotel, they offered a very nice breakfast, beautiful canapés and snacks at cocktail time with a nice…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 August 2015,4,A beautiful Hotel if you just want to relax.,"The Hyatt Regency Casablanca is a beautiful Hotel with beautiful rooms. The rooms however, depending on which level you are on my not have a nice view (as ours didn't - overlooking the top of the lobby as we were on level 2). The food is reasonable, the staff are in general pleasant, but NOT extremely warm with the greeting. However they tend to be somewhat more friendly / warm if you are either French or of Middle Eastern background. I myself am Egyptian (now living in Sydney) however my girlfriend is Maltese (but looks english due to the colour of her skin etc).

The hotel is right across the street from the medina of Casablanca and a short taxi to the famous Hassan II mosque as well as to Rick's Cafe. While the food may be a little pricey, it is good as are their drinks.

 August 2015,3,Disappointing,"Stayed for two nights whilst on business, I spend roughly 200 nights a year in hotels and have become pretty tolerant in regard to expectations. Having experienced Moroccan hospitality many times I was saddened to be at the receiving end of discrimination, being a white British man who travels length and breadth of the globe one expects occasional discomfort in my being there, I was surprised by many of the staff in the hotel whom may not directly verbally express it but by the way of their actions it is obtuse - small things observed such as bottled water to native guests on arrival at the pool - I wasn't met with the same courtesy. Having to stand at the bar to get served as ignored at the table, to again return to get a further drink. Small things get noticed.

 July 2015,4,Very Accommodating,"I had some free nights and points so I used them at this hotel. It was unexpectedly good. I had a nice room facing the old medina. The wi-fi, A/C, bathroom, towels, bed and pillows, phone, and free water were great. A Nespresso machine was provided. The restaurant, bar, mini-bar are outrageously over-priced. A cafe is $5 (50 dirhams). When will these hotels realize that overcharging x 5 simply annoys guests-no matter how much money they have. Oh well. The concierges were quite helpful. I found restaurants and a taxi driver for a tour of the city. This is a story in itself. First, the price for the tour was 200 dirhams an hour; at the last minute it became 250/hr because ""the driver speaks good English.""

Everyone from the littlest employee to the biggest was asking during the stay how i was.i couldn't be but happy and the departure was a bit hard for me as i felt that i was leaving a family.

Lobby area can get smoky with cigarette smoke depending on how many people are in the lounge, as this was during Ramadan and this was the buffet meal in the evening it was quite packed so understandable why the smoke level was high.

When I asked about this, they said they don't have rooms with double beds available. Next day, the same reason was given, until I made further complaint and was moved to a double bed room. 2.

In many American hotels you are given an answer to your questions BUT at this Hyatt not only did staff tell me they also showed me. This consistently happened with all staff members I encountered.

This pervades throughout your stay whether you're in the exquisitely warm, contemporary yet unmistakably traditional breakfast area, any of the nothing short of marvellous restaurants or simply relaxing in your room.

My husband gets up earlier than I and I just couldn't get that extra 45 minutes of snoozing time. I've not seen such a ridiculous arrangement before. Otherwise the rooms are fine.

Casablanca is the best connected international airport in Morocco so most travellers start here; however, apart from the name which evokes romantic notions, the city does not have much to write about. The hotel though is great. It is extremely well-located, has great views of the main square in the city and is close to a lot of the sights. The rooms are clean, well-appointed and have more than adequate space. Service levels are generally high and the breakfast was definitely the best we had in Morocco.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,5,WHAT A PLACE,"The people who work here, make it great. So very nice a friendly. Great restaurants and lounge's in the lobby. The lobby is beautiful.

My room was brilliant, overlooking the plaza in front of the hotel.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2015,5,I am in love with this hotel!,"The staff are AMAZING! and after that, the lobby and restaurants are beautiful, the rooms are gorgeous and clean, and the views are amazing. I usually stay at much cheaper places in Casa, but my partner wanted to splurge. I am VERY happy that we did! Be sure to ask for a room facing the place des nations unies.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2015,4,The best hotel breakfast ever!,We were just staying in Hyatt Regency for two nights at the beginning of our Moroccan holiday. I had little expectation of the hotel but it turned out to be just fine. The souk was close by and the huge square was a great introduction to everyday life in Casablanca. Room was perfectly adequate but the highlight of the stay was the amazing breakfast. The chef and his helper were ready to make some wonderful specialities and every food item we tried was of top quality. Staff were helpful; we didn't swim... SO cold! The fitness Centre and the Hamman were closed for renovations but we spent time exploring the medina (right close by) and taking a tram which is just opposite the hotel. A lovely way to travel.,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Also the front counter staff greeted me by name each time I entered the lobby.The accommodation was spotless and all issues were attended to promptly. There was no waiting when a request was made.

 March 2015,5,"Hyatt Regency, gold standards anywhere!","We stayed at HR Casablanca for only one night. The check in / out was very fast. The room is as expected nice for the money. The breakfast is ample and high quality. Nothing to complain about. The Medina is right across the street, making this location very desirable as you can easily wonder through the medina without too much fuss with taxi cabs. We did not try the hotel restaurant but will assume that the HR standards are maintained. This is a hotel i feel familiar and the only hotel i stayed in Morocco that has a fully functionable great shower, and a hair dryer which i don't need to press down a button, also with long enough chord to dry my hair comfortably.

 March 2015,5,A short but very memorable stay - oozes quality!,"Regularly doing business in neighbouring Algeria, I came to Morocco for the first time not really knowing what to expect. I stayed in Casablanca at the Hyatt for one night, but despite my fleeting stay, left thinking this was a top, top establishment. A good location by all accounts, but what really stood out for me, and made this hotel deserving of 5 stars, was the service. From the moment I stepped out of the taxi people were at my beck and call and numerous people welcomed me to the hotel in an amicable manner. This is a great feeling to experience. Then, upon checking in and other enquiries, there are no issues that can't be overcome, as the receptionists fluent in 3 languages. They try and cater everything to your personal preferences and nothing is more important than your…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2015,5,Just a bit of lunch!!,"Very attentative service! Used business centre and coffee shop/bar! Staff coudn't do enough to help me!! The lunch was as expected 5*!

 March 2015,4,"Great Location, Comfortable Room","My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights for vacation. Room was comfortable, hotel was centrally located. The hotel had multiple restaurant options and all were good. We really enjoyed the French and Moroccan restaurants. My only complaint is the inconsistent service. The concierge was non-existent. We tried talking to the front desk but did not get any helpful recommendations. Additionally, the service at the 6pm Bar was sub par. When we were there it was never crowded and the server/bartenders were just standing around talking. You had to work hard to get someone's attention for service. Overall, I would probably return to this hotel in Casablanca.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

If you are staying in the room with business partner or parents it is impossible to take shower !! They don't have dinner buffet.It's a la carte. We were with a group so they put us in the night club are to have breakfast. Not plesant to have breakfast in a dark room with underground music.

 February 2015,3,Average,"I stayed two nights for a conference. Location is excellent as close to the market, the mosque, and transportation. Room was large with a nice view. Loud at night on weekends as it is close to a major square. Bed is excellent, bath is excellent with excellent amenities. Ate breakfast and lunch there, and food was far below what I expected.

I would have liked to stay longer: the room was attractive, the bathroom great, and the bed, the best of the trip. The lobby, bar, and restaurant are stunning. It is a bit wierd, however, to eat breakfast (lovely spread) in a dark, turreted room that feels like a Moroccan stage set. Staff was very pleasant and efficient.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Before check-in, we may have THOUGHT we would have preferred a local riad to a ""global hospitality company,"" but turns out.... we would've been wrong. The impersonal, international setting we feared never materialized. Instead we enjoyed Moroccan ambiance and found comfortable beds; a lavish breakfast buffet; and a super location.

 January 2015,4,Comfort and Safety in Casablanca,"My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Casablanca for New Years Eve. Guests must walk through metal detectors to enter the hotel, which is a bit alarming. The staff was excellent, our room was comfortable and clean and room service was fantastic. The hotel is across the street from the Medina (which by the way is not exciting - nothing compared to the Marrakech or Fes medinas.) I would recommend the Hyatt Regency Casablanca if you want comfort, safety and service.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,5,Beautiful hotel in the downtown,Lovely lobby in this downtown hotel. The general area around the hotel is not good but much of Casablanca is probably the same except for select residential areas. It is close to markets and local activity. The check in was easy and our room was ready when we arrived. Our room included breakfast and snacks in the upstairs lounge area. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The Moroccan restaurant on the first floor was excellent.,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

At first we were interested in more local hotels instead of an international brand. However, we were pleased to find out that the Hyatt is one of the best hotels in Casablanca and it well deserves this recognition. The hotel is centrally located, very well appointed and kept in top shape. The rooms were nice sizes and had great attention to detail. We stayed on the club level which included a breakfast and evening snacks and a full range of beverages which was enough for a supper after a long day of touring. We enjoyed breakfast in the first floor restaurant which had a wider variety and was very good. The décor was also Moroccan in nature and very well done.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The hotel is not just an hotel, it has two reastaurants inside, a bar, a pool, a gym, free wifi. For the room nothing to say: they are big and with all confort you need, both shower and bath as you like. Breakfast is good as well as you can have warm and cold, maybe a bit pricy (around 26 euro).

 January 2015,5,Don't judge a book but it's cover,"On arrival in Casblanca, I looked at the Hyatt... Slightly faded white walls made it look run down, I was more than happy to be staying somewhere else. We ended our Moroccan experience with a second visit to Casblanca and decided for a change of hotels. The Hyatt was lovely, a beautiful elegant lobby, great breakfast, free wifi, and most of all brilliant service that made me feel welcomed and at home as well as looked after. The only complaint that I can make is that the hotel shower doors are see through, staying with my granny made for quite the awkward situation. The location is perfect, a few metres from the medina, even closer to the tram and all round very central. The vibe was great and the staff as well as taxi drivers were very accommodating and helpful to my granny…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2014,5,Lives up to the Hyatt Reputation,"The service was top notch from the moment I got off the tram and crossed into the Hyatt sphere. The staff at the door took my luggage and showed me to reception. Checking in was no problem and I was shown my room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom/shower room was a good size. The only oddity was the toilette which was separate from the bathroom and whose door didn't close properly.

 July 2014,5,Casablanca at its best,"If you want to visit the city in style, this is the hotel to book. Right in the centre of Casablanca, you may walk from the Hyatt towards the modern part of the city or in the opposite direction & style, the Medina. The insides of the hotel are impressive, and the restaurants are recommendable though pricey. Rooms are of fair sizes, and the view from the top floors are excellent (ask for the ones with a view towards the Medina).",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,5,Hotel stay,"fantastic, great , probably one of the best Hyatt hotels I have stayed in and I have been in a lot of them spanning all continents including that in Auckland, New Zealand.

 December 2014,5,Pleasant Surprise,"This is a very good business hotel in Casablanca. It is situated fairly well in the city and everyone knows where it is located. The room was great, comfortable and spacious. The restaurants serve very good and flavorful food. I must say however that it is the professionalism and the quality of the staff.

I will certainly stay there over and over again.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,4,Good business hotel with a touch of charm,"Well located the Hyatt is an inviting hotel in Casablanca. Rooms are up to the international standard and the atmosphere of the lobby boast some sort of an old charm. It is strange that smoking is permitted at such an international place. The Regency club must be recommended at the 8th floor for its business facilities and very kind and attentive service. Surely, a place where you feel good on a business trip.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,3,OK hotel - with a few hiccups,"The most impressive part of the Hyatt Regency Casablanca is the lobby. But that’s about it. The rooms are OK, but are let down by a few odd touches. Most notably, the toilet is in a separate room, with a ‘sewage-type’ opening on the floor. This meant that I came across a few insects, which was very disturbing. And parts of the hotel are starting to fall apart, quite literally (eg electricy sockets, etc…). Staff are generally good, although a few would benefit from more training re customer service. One final point about Casablanca – if you’re thinking of visiting the city as a tourist, don’t. There really isn’t anything to do or see here.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,5,"Excellent Service, Great Location, Perfect for Business","This hotel should be your first choice if visiting Casablanca on business. Located centrally to the old town and waterfront. Having stayed in Hyatt hotels all over the world, the service at the Casablanca Hyatt really stood as being incredibly good, in a different league to all other Hyatts and on par with what you'd expect from the Taj group (especially the 8th floor business lounge manager). The room was excellent, good bed, good facilities, quiet and a great view over the sea and Medina. The food in the Moroccon restaurent on the ground floor is fabulous and one of the best restaurents in town. It was a shame that the spa is under construction, but this was made up for in other ways. I would definetley stay again.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2014,4,Excellent Hotel But...,"I stayed with a group for 3 nights in November 2014. This is an awesome hotel. Everything about this hotel, the location, the rooms, the staff, the food, is good. However, one thing frustrated me quite a bit and I don't understand it at all. The toilet was separate from the bathroom and without a place to wash hands. Why? What is the logic behind this? Additionally, the plumbing in the shower, which was otherwise very spacious, needed to be repaired. Every time I took a shower, I was ankle deep in dirty water. These are the only two faults I found, that push me to give 4 stars.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2014,4,Very good for Moroccan standards,"Check in and welcome: Valet parking was offered; Parking for free; Most probably one of the most professional check ins, we have ever experienced; the senior receptionist (a lady) was really very friendly, explained everything in detail, gave us an room upgrade and took care of everything. Room: The hallways towards the room and the room doors look a bit old and shabby; Clean room, especially compaired to the Moroccan standard; perfect view towards the Great Mosque; Nice mattresses, pillows and sheets; Free wifi. Bar: Great, cozy ambience; Try the Casablance beer! Pool area: Not very inviting; Should be improved; No service (drinks) etc. was offered.

 November 2014,4,Great service,"Spent the weekend at the Casablanca Hyatt. The hotel is centrally located with many restaurants that are rated highly in Trip Advisor nearby. The rooms are nice as is the rest of the hotel. The lobby is the showstopper and is filled throughout the evening. It has a lot going for it but it is not a five star hotel. There is something missing that makes you want a little more. However, the price is incredibly reasonable and I would rate it highly.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2014,4,Feeling welcome at a great loaction.,"Very friendly service. Calm and nice rooms, where you can feel well. Good location to visit the city.The breakfirst is a must with big variety.

 November 2014,3,Need to reinvest,"Services, food, bar, restaurant are at 5 star level, but the rooms leave much to be desired.

Wow - you can not compare the two hotels. The staff are friendly, the rooms are modern and very relaxing (for a hotel room), the set up of the hotel is excellent and as a diamond member the lounge and service is exceptional. Moving to the Hyatt The managers of the Diamond club on the 8th floor Rada and Abderahim are both fantastic and make the stay most enjoyable. As hotels go within Morocco this is excellent.

 October 2014,5,Still the best business hotel in Casablanca,"This is not my first review of this hotel - I stay here often, but not always, when I travel to Casablanca. My choice is often defined by what conferences I am attending... in this instance it was for my own team so I could influence the choice and we chose the Hyatt. In terms of accommodating a larger booking, it was managed by our admin team but the feedback I received was positive. What I wanted to really write about was the professional and personal service I continue to receive.

 October 2014,4,Modern hotel,Beds comfortable. Next to medina (although there wasn't much there). Nice hotel with many more plugs than some of the other hotels I stayed at in Morocco.

 October 2014,5,"Immaculate, wonderful service and very safe","My husband and I spent a few nights at the Hyatt while he recuperated from an illness before boarding our flight home. What a good decision - the hotel is located right in the heart of the city but yet you pass thru gates to enter and the security is very tight. It is a world unto itself. As soon as you drive in, it is a whole different world - an oasis. A wonderful oasis !! The pool was a welcome relief - the water so sparkling. We enjoyed dining poolside. We received impeccable service and the food was very, very good. I even splurged and enjoyed a medium rare hamburger. There is an ATM right in the lobby and plenty to do at the hotel so one never has to leave. We tried going to the Medina right across the street one afternoon, but quickly returned to the hotel. …",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2014,4,Never disappoints,"I have been staying at this hotel on and off for the past ten years and it never disappoints. Booking by email is a little tricky, you never get the same person twice but it always works out in the end. Pick up from the airport was timely, the vehicle clean and comfortable. The staff are all impossibly kind and friendly, eager to be helpful. The lobby lounge is my favorite spot for a drink, a meal or just to hang out. The other restaurants are just as good and attentive. Both standard rooms and suites are large and comfortable, room service and housekeeping are immediate.

 September 2014,4,Stay at Hyatt Regency in Casablanca,"I stayed there recently for a week on a business trip. It is not the first time as I have stayed there many times before. However, upon arrival this time, I was greeted like a Celebrity and was given an upgrade to an excutive suite as I was told this was my tenth stay at the hotel. This was very good and I really did not expect such a nice and professional treatment. I think the only aspect this hotel is lacking is a nice Gym and spa which both are under renovation and I hope they do a good job.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2014,4,A very high quality business hotel,"The Hyatt Regency is located in the centre of Casablanca, within walking distance of some of the main Government offices. It is furnished in the typical Hyatt, slightly old-fashioned, style, with lots of dark wood, but that is a style with which I am quite happy. I arrived to find my travel agent had failed to make the reservation, but they were able to find me a room, with an excellent view over a busy square. The room was a good size, well-equipped and comfortable. WiFi was free, and the connection was made quickly, though the line speed could be slow at times. The breakfast buffet had a good range of food, with a few imaginative choices. I also ate in the lobby bar, but the food here was less interesting, and the service was very slow.

 September 2014,4,A large central Hotel,"Located Place des Nations Unies, right next to the old Medinah, the hotel can be reached by cab in 40 to 70 minutes, based on the state of chaotic traffic. The hotel is luxurious with nice lobby, a good-looking and comfortable bar. The outdoor pool is large and open throughout the day, but does not open early enough to take a swim before going to work. Rooms are large comfortable, but it is difficult to get a non-smoking room even when asking at booking time. As a result, togther with noiy and sometimes old air conditioning uits, rooms can have a bad smell. Beds are comfortable, bathroom is very nice, and the desk and chairs are designed for business work. Service is very nice and very kind like often in Casablanca, but could be more professional.

This hotel felt very safe, clean, and very friendly, and had an exotic flair that I wasn't expecting from a Hyatt. When staff didn't know the answer to something they always found out and solved the problem; overall, great hospitality. They even wrote a lovely note that they left in my room when the door locks stopped working, which was a nice touch! The pool is beautiful and I very much enjoyed swimming in the mornings before the meeting. The rooms were spacious and nice, great bathroom, with consistent internet. There were movies on the room TV, in English, which was nice for a night, albeit they were censored quite a bit (to be expected, I guess).

 September 2014,4,Nice for a big hotel,"The public spaces in this hotel were beautiful. They reflected the character of the country. The rooms were very comfortable, but they had the bland look that hotels seem to favor these days. We appreciate the convenience of the split bath--wish all hotels had that! Our room looked out on the medina and the minaret, which we liked. We liked the availability of bottled water, which you need for this trip, without being nickled and dimed for it. One problem for us was that we were on a different time zone and there was not anyplace in the hotel where we could eat before the late start of dinner. They advertised tapas, and a bar with food, but there was none. The hotel is in a good location, across the streets from the souks, and in the heart of everything.

 September 2014,4,The service you'd expect for the price,"For a western traveler in a North African city, the Hyatt Regency Casablanca provides the kind of experience you would hope for. It is centrally located on United Nations Place, near the Old Medina and lots of shops. A shuttle to and from the airport is available through the hotel, and it worked well on the leg I took it, although it was nearly twice as much as a cab. Rooms are spacious and clean (although mine did not get made up one of the eight days I was there). The one hotel restaurant I ate in, Cafe M, had very good food that was almost, but not quite, European.

We were given another suite immediately which was perfect. It was almost midnight and yet we were able to order sandwiches and drinks. On the way to breakfast the following morning I asked the concierge if it would possible to arrange an air conditioned car with an English speaking driver to show us around Casablanca.

First, the positives - there are some really nice staff at the hotel from concierge to front desk to the executive lounge. They were helpful in doing things like getting medicine from the pharmacy, moving rooms, and helping in the lounge. Now, the downside. Overall the hotel is quite uncomfortable. If you are a non-smoker, this hotel is not for you. There is smoke everywhere including in the rooms that are non-smoking (it filters in through the vents and under the door). Second, the beds are extremely uncomfortable and I am not usually a troubled sleeper.

The souk is just across the street! The staff was friendly, they spoke english (not all of them), breakfast venue was a bit tiny and I could do with a bit more international variety. But overall, my stay was very satisfactory. Also, across the square where the hotel is, there is a small and very traditional moroccan restaurant. The food there is to die for!!!

The best example I can give of the quality of services is when they had run out of Casablanca beer at the end of Eid. Typically things run slower the week after Ramadan as many people (including suppliers) take time out.

It was difficult to get our tea served before we had finished eating. The Moroccan restaurant downstairs was rather fun, with its evening entertainment. The first belly dancer had no belly and didn't seem to dance much, but as there were only a few guests maybe she found it uninspiring. It must be difficult to dance when your audience is so small. The second, on the other hand, was great to watch, and the food was excellent.

I arrived late, and when I got to my room, I was desperate to brush my teeth and go to bed. I wanted to use bottled water to brush my teeth, but put my mini bar was locked. When I called downstairs, they said it was locked because they did not have a credit card on file. This was not true, as I had just checked in and given them my corporate Amex card. They send someone up to open the door, but this took him about 20 minutes. Eventually, I was able to brush my teeth and go to bed. The rest of my stay was much better, and I enjoyed the meals in the hotel restaurant. This hotel seems to be THE place to be seen in Casablanca, as Tom Hanks and John Kerry were both there during my stay.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2014,3,Club Services and Fitness Center Lacking,"If you stay on the club level and plan to visit the club room in the evening, make sure you arrive early. The first night food and beverage was replenished; however, on the second night nothing was replenished. For those of us arriving midway through the evening there was little left. The fitness center is way in the back of the hotel. There is some exercise equipment, lockers and spa related facilities, but the quality is severely lacking. It's not an inviting place to visit. I stayed on the side facing the tram and found my room to be noisy.

As it was a working trip i did not have the luxury to use as a normal holiday hotel, but that said we made use of the swimming pool,gym and various restaurants in the hotel with our clients. I found there were enough front of house english speaking members of staff at the hotel, and were very willing to help and assist me in any way they could at anytime of day or night.

 February 2014,4,One of the better choices,"Although there are a few more alternatives such as Sofitel and Sheraton, Hyatt is the better choice in Casablanca. It is located next to Old Medina and in a rather poor section of the city. I have to say it is quite expensive and VERY expensive in Moroccan standards. However, if you will be in Casablanca for business get a Club Level room if you can afford it. It comes with free wireless Internet (good speed) and use of the lounge. Lounge cocktail hours are quite limited (6-8 pm) and not much food, but it is not too bad for breakfast except there is no hot food.Service in general is quite attentive and rooms are fair size, however the plumbing is rather noisy.Overall not a bad place to stay in Casablanca.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2014,3,"Excellent Location, but not perfect 5 stars service","I stayed in Hyatt Regency Casablanca for three nights. The location of the hotel is very good. It's actually the most strategic place for a hotel in Casablanca. The location will provide you with access to Tramway, the Old City, Hassan the 2nd Mosque and basically everything is close to you. On the other hand comes the quality of service. In my point of view this hotel doesn't really worth 5 stars because in my case the room services didn't clean the room everyday, and we didn't have enough bottles of waters sometimes because obviously they didn't come except twice out of four days. The food they provided for breakfast wasn't 5 stars service. Once I had piece of rotten strawberry, and sometimes when a certain type of foods runs out, they are slow to refill it, so you end up…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

You will not be disappointed with the management, staff and quality of rooms provided. I travel a lot and have stayed in many hotels around the world. When it comes to the best, you have found it. I felt I found an African gem of a hotel. Plenty to do also as there are shops and shopping within walking distance of the hotel. If security is an issue for you the hotel is well guarded by top notch security professionals. The rooms are excellent (don't forget a nice hot bubble bath), clean and have most everything you need.

 January 2014,5,This place is why I love Hyatt,"My husband, 3 year old, and I had the pleasure of staying at the Hyatt Casablanca in January 2014. Our stay was flawless. The hotel has a touch of Morocco overlaying the traditional Hyatt style, but if you are looking for a more authentic or exotic feel, this might not be the hotel for you. If you want high end, dependable quality, though, I can't recommend this hotel enough. We were upgraded to a suite immediately upon checking in, and it was lovely. There was an extra bed (twin) put in the spacious living room area for my daughter, and she loved it. The helpful desk team presented her with a flower each time we stopped at the desk, and a waiter gave her a small teddy bear at breakfast.

Apparently it's the safest place to stay, and after being mugged at knifepoint, safe sounded great to me. But anyway! The food here was delicious, the staff was really helpful with arranging for cabs to take me to get my new passport, and even had one of their doormen walk with me to a trusted photography studio to get a new passport picture taken.

No problem with noise. Nice sized bathroom. Breakfast was great with beautiful public rooms for eating and using the free WIFI. No complaints except it was an expensive night ($400+ per night) to add on to our tour. Not the hotel's fault.

 November 2013,2,Tatty at the edges,"I have stayed at this hotel at least ten times, mainly because there are not really many options for a good hotel in Casablanca. The stay I have just taken will be my last. Firstly it is way overpriced for what it is. Yes the location is good and the rooms quite comfortable but the hotel is starting to get very tatty i.e. stains on many chairs in the lounge area, chipped furniture, old fashioned bathrooms..... absolutely miserable security staff....slow service....and worst of all the low slug chairs everywhere in reception, breakfast room and the Moroccan restaurant,,,,these have not changed in years and they are very uncomfortable INDEED.

After a 12 hour journey and total confidence that I had paid for the room I was not going to be moved that easily. I was there as part of a business delegation staying for 3 nights. Somehow with the help of the organisers of the conference - not the hotel who had given up on finding me a room - I was finally given a room two hours after arriving.

The Der Beida Moroccan restaurant was fantastic with authentic Moroccan food and live entertainment. This was let down by a case of food poisoning of a signature dish from the Der Beida restaurant menu. Further, early in the morning before checking out, I had my electric shaver stolen from the bathroom of my room. I did not report immediately as I was a little late for my flight. I reported these two incidences via the Hyatt feedback form and have not yet received a reply. All hotel staff should be searched by hotel security to ensure hotel guests are not stolen from.

By now my wife had a sprained ankle and a large blister on her foot and the front desk staff were most helpful in providing a medical kit and even assisting with applying iodine to the area - service that was way beyond expectations. We were on the Club Floor and the first night just stayed in the Club and had wine and appetizers for dinner. The other folks we were travelling with went to the Moroccan restaurant and had a good evening. We also just had breakfast on the Club Floor and that was fine as well.

 July 2013,2,Hyatt poor service,"My girlfriends and I stayed at the hyatt, the only international chain throughout our recent visit to morocco. The rooms were crampy for triple share & the toilet doors were see through. A bit odd for friends sharing room. We stayed the 1st night in Casablanca and our last night. On our last night upon arrival from marrakech, we informed reception that we didn't want a room with transparent toilet doors. She said ok and yet assigned such a room to us. We had to call reception to change room, asked for front office manager Armando but he instead of offering solution, gave us excuses, ie said only 10 rooms in hotel with non transparent toilet doors and all were full. my friends spoke with another reception Zara who assigned another room but with strong food stench and we called…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2013,4,A wonderful experience - what an awesome service!,"The location is marvelous just next to the basar and the service is awesome. I had a suite on the 11th floor and i was impressed by the view from my room over the basar towards the sea. I also very much liked the Nespresso machine in the room, but the best was the piltes mat, so I could do my morning exercise in style. I did not like that there was a carpet, but to be honest it looked fresh and clean. The internet was fast. The mattress a little bit too hard. The room might need some renovation within the next 2 years, but for the moment it is still ok. The breakfast in the executive lounge was great and the service was awesome.

I have a special bond with the hotel: I can't put my finger on it, but it makes me feel at home. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. The staff is very, very friendly. I'm always impressed that they greet me by name. The hotel is clean. The little touch that makes it for me is the lounge music throughout the entire hotel. Breakfast is elaborate but rather expensive at 260DHR. As well, it's funny but sad to see that the staff easily looses control during the morning rush. Glasses are not added fast enough, the jar of orange juice remains empty for too long... Nothing a good manager wouldn't be able to fix though. The attached Café M is worth the visit!

Prior to that I visited the corniche ( Ain Diab) along the Atlantic coast, which had a mushroom growth of bars, night clubs, karaoke clubs etc. These places were infested with men & women looking for lonely foriegners to cheat & rob them of their money and other valuables.The Black House was real fun and an upscale place to drink, dance and meet beautiful & young Moroccan women.

The lobby is amazing, food is very high quality (would recommend to try the pastries), my bedroom was perfect and the service the best ever. Staff is very well trained, there is nothing wrong about anyone in the staff. The gym is good and the area around the pool very pleasant. I would also mentioned the breakfast which can't be missed. The cooker can make wafles, pancakes, omelettes ans again the quality of products is very high. Breakfast can be continental, English or more local. The breakfast is adapted to everyone.

Large meeting rooms for business events. Don't go there for the swimming pool, however, as it is rather small, and more the background to the pool restaurant than a relaxing holiday place. DO NOT use the ground line for confcalls, as they will bill you over 100 Euros per hour! Outrageous!

Its not cheap, but the facilities seem pretty good - although we did not get chance to use many of them. Room and bathroom were clean & quite plush. Everything (aircon, TV, WiFi) worked perfectly, and the bathroom had a separate bathtub & shower. The breakfast buffet was OK, with European & African options - but the service was a bit chaotic. It took ages to get tables cleared & re-laid. The bar near the lobby is a good spot for a beer or a glass of wine.

The hotel is also extremely well appointed in the heart of the city overlooking the recently upgraded United Nations Square; which is very pretty. The hotel is simply lacking a quality management presence. There is no shortage of staff but they are badly organised and rarely were we attended to without prompting in the hotel bar and cafe. At no point did we see any senior member of the hotel team making their presence felt to either guests or more importantly staff. If they were doing so, it was extremely discreet and was not having any impact. By no standard could the property boast genuine 5 star service.

Slept well on the 3rd floor facing the tram line, noise was within expectations (its very central and the old souk is close by). The staff were very helpful and worked to help us find a few innovative solutions to those little problems that occur first day in a new place. When in Casa again we will return for sure.

Our room was clean and spacious; bathroom is large. However, the toilet was at another location and there is no washbasin in there so we had to go to the bathroom to wash hands, that was a bit awkward. We had a queen size bed and bed was firm, bed linen, towels were clean. The sleep quality in that room was good, did not hear any noises at night.

 August 2012,2,Miserable service,"This is a review from an unabashed fan of Hyatt -- I travel a lot for work, stay at Hyatts around the world, Diamond on the rewards scale, love the brand. The Hyatt Regency Casablanca has the worst service of any Hyatt I have stayed at worldwide. I stayed here for two nights on business this past summer. First night, arrived at 10 PM. No one in line for reservations, was asked to wait 20 minutes for unclear reasons for check-in. Was essentially fluffed off by the woman at the counter when I asked for separate twins (as I had requested by telephone 3 days prior, and advised them of the late check-in). Was told that there were rooms with separate beds, but I had not requested them previously, and hence they could not place me in one. Not sure what that was about, but I asked to…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2012,2,Flying insects and cockroaches in restaurant!,"I stayed at Hyatt Regency Casablanca for business and received a room overlooking the city, which was good. The hotel facilities were not matching its price and I didn't receive any Platinum member services during my stay. The bathrooms were not properly cleaned and only received minimal care. The food variety for breakfast was also not sufficient at all. All was fine until I spotted flying insects roaming around the food at the buffet and a cockroach by the piano which is located right outside the dining area. I asked to have the food removed and changed, which actually happened. My problem was that this was the norm there at the restaurant every day. However, I have to say that the staff at the restaurant are very nice. This is my second time in Casa and I was hoping to get…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2012,3,Not many choices,"First of all I must say that there really arent a whole lot of good options in Casablanca. The city is dirty, noisy and generally not very safe. The Hyatt probably is the only decent option which could be why the staff has such a ""whatever"" attitude. We checked in a day prior to our tour and our tour director was actually the one who checked us in with the staff. This was all prepaid by the tour company. We were told that the club lounge was not open for drinks for the next 2 nights and not for breakfast the next morning. We were given other options. No problem. The next afternoon my husband and I decided to relax and have lunch by the pool. We waited OVER 45 minutes for service.

 August 2012,4,Casablanca oasis,"We stayed at the Hyatt in Casablanca for a long weekend and although it was Ramadan and the restauramts were either closed or very busy, the stay was very enjoyable. The rooms were very nice and clean and the pool area / bar / restaurant was the same. Staff were helpful although English is not perfectively spoken it is certainly acceptable and knowing a little french goes a long way. There are a lot of nearby restaurants and cafes and a large medina is opposite the hotel. We visited ""Ricks Cafe"" which, albeit not the original from the film (there never was a Ricks in Casablanca), was a really good night out and everything you would have expected from the film version.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2012,3,Quality remains an elusive goal,"For a Hyatt, I must say the hotel is disappointing! The lobby is nice with a nice warm feel to it with lots of comfy sofas, the staff are smiley & the Moroccan restaurant is really good, the hotel is 2 min walk from Medina, but that's about it!!! I stayed in room number 100 where one of the phones was missing, the other broken which means you can't even call the reception when there's a problem! The sink didn't drain water & internet could not be accessed due to ""interface"" issues that needed at least 2 requests & 30 min to fix but worst of all, almost unbearable the AC was broken & released exhaust fumes into the room. Worst of all, when you inform the duty manager about all this, you'd imagine he'd be appalled & actually do something (he did fix internet though) …",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2012,4,Falls short of the normal Hyatt experience,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in October 2012 as it was recommended by the client I was visiting. The choices in Casablanca are limited for ""5 Star"" hotels as although this is advertized as 5 star it certainly falls short of the label. I booked a club level room and the quality of the room and amenities did not feel like a $400 per night hotel. The furniture and bedding was dated. The club lounge was actually very good and the service was also good. As Casablanca is a smoking environment having the club with its non-smoking rule was worth the extra room cost. All the hotel restaurants and bars have smoking in all areas even though they have the ""non-smoking areas"".

 October 2012,2,Surprisingly below average,Read the reviews about this hotel before arriving so probably set my expectations much higher than they should.. This is not the best hotel in casablanca and if it is oh dear! I arrived at around 1 am and it took about 10 minutes to check me in. The reception told me there were no room so he would give me a junior suite for 1 night BUT I have to leave it the second night and go to a room. My answer was but I am only staying 3 nights and I don't want to move about?! He was not too happy but reluctantly agreed. It's not my fault they had no rooms! I had booked well in advance.... Upon coming to the suite was thankful I didn't get a room! Refurbishing is badly needed for a Hyatt am surprised of the conditions.

We reached the hotel after 12 hours flying, we were all looking forward to go to our rooms to take rest and we thought that checking in would hardly take 5 or 10 mn since payment was done at the time of booking. It actually took one hour! First the receptionist said that there were no booking in the name of our company, I asked her to double check but she said that as per her system no booking was there.

 September 2012,4,Nice Hotel for Business Travellers,"Hotel was just as expected. Pictures do not lie. Room was clean and comfortable. TV was quite small but no biggie. Food was wayyyy over priced, especially breakfast. Expect to pay over $30pp for simple meal of pastries, coffee, eggs, and potatoes. Total rip off. Lounge area was nice but beware this is a smoking hotel and people in Casablanca LOVE to smoke. Yassine (our concierge) took excellent care of us. He recommended an awesome restaurant called Cebastan on the water for dinner. Wonderful experience, about a 15 taxi ride from the hotel. Always take the red taxi and negoiate the price before getting in. Any trip less than 15 mins should only cost around 30DH. We paid 50DH from the Casa Voyeurs (sp) train station to the hotel.

 September 2012,4,"Nice but watch out for ""helpful"" valets","The hotel is beautiful, centrally located and the food is reasonable. There is a common area in front of he hotel for catching taxis. The hotel valets were extremely willing to help us get a taxi. However, it wasnt until the third day there that we realized that the valets and taxi drivers were badly overcharging us. We paid anywhere from 80 to 100 MAD when in reality we should have been paying 30 to 50 MAD. We realized that the valets were getting kickbacks from the taxi drivers. While this is a very common thing in Morocco, I feel that the hotel should have done a better job at protecting their patrons and ensuring that they were not taken advantage of.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2012,5,Best business hotel in town,"I always stay at the Hyatt Regency when in Casablanca. It is an excellent hotel with wonderful rooms, excellent service and a really first class Moroccan restaurant. Also, great breakfasts. The rooms are very quiet and comfortable and I've always been able to get a lot of work done. Casablanca is probably the least picturesque city in all of Morocco and, for me the hotel is a welcome refuge from the urban ugliness. At the same time, it is right beside the old traditional market, which can't match Fas or Marrakesh but does have a certain amount of charm. At the moment the hotel is fronted by massive construction of a metro system, which will almost certainly improve the public area but is presently a pain. I think there is pretty much a consensus that this is the best hotel in…",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The pool side restaurant offered a tranquil, relaxed atmosphere, a menu with interesting and imaginative selections, and the food was excellent quality and delicious. Service was gracious and friendly - my waiter even offered to help troubleshoot my Mac when it could not connect to the wifi (which he was successful with). Thank you! The staff thoughtfully ensured transportation to the airport was arranged to allow for traffic delays and that the price was a customary fare, due to me traveling alone and not speaking French.

Great olives! Their lounge is rather dimly lit, and the music gets loud. However, the music and dancing in the Moroccan restuarant is better (authentic) and really relaxes the weary traveller.

Out of the three cities I spent time in, I found Casablanca to have the fewest English speaking folks but the desk staff did speak English. On the plus side, there is more Spanish spoken in Casablanca than in Agadir or Marrakech. The noise below is there - it's in a very busy part of town.

Best thing about the hotel is the spacious and comfortable rooms, not to mention the great view of the - not very distant - Hassan II mosque and the ocean. Meals and the service are extremely good, and the staff is friendly. The location of the hotel has a good side and a bad side: one way, it is located downtown where one can get close to anything no sweat, however, and because of the civil works downtown Casablanca - specifically around the hotel - the area is always jammed with traffic.

 March 2012,4,It was fine - very good staff - Roadworks uggh!!,The hotel is fine - It is a Hyatt Regency so you expect it to be nice - and it is fully adequate. I had a superior room and was kind of disappointed with the view - it looked out over the Place des Nations Unies which is being totally torn up at the moment - the square is strewn with barriers as they lay tram lines over the area. The surrounding area is very picturesque - nice parks and squares all within walking distance. The restaurants in the hotel are very good - though expensive by local standards. The grand taxis congregate right outside the front door and of course try to charge you outrageous prices to go the smallest distance. The staff at the hotel are wonderful - especially the concierge.

Bottled water was free, there was free, fast wired internet in the room, and there is ample room in the very nice lobby for impromptu meetings with colleagues. When I was there in December the computer was down at checkout, which meant we got only handwritten receipts until a regular receipt was emailed several days later. The elevators were broken and being repaired, so there were queues. Breakfast was not included and expensive, and the room was expensive. There is road construction in front which makes crossing the street to a regular breakfast restaurant tricky but possible. You can walk to the medina.

Especially the breakfast area with it's classic-style dome, as well as the restaurant and fireside-area in the lobby were warmly appreciated. The main (big if you're here for leisure and not business) is the pool, which is in a small fenced of area by the back of the building, separated from the road noise by a fence and bushes (feels like standing in the middle of the intersection). Still, besides this, another good side is the location right off the old Medina, inviting for a casual stroll.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The separate toilet room at the entrance of the room is a nice touch. The corridors are dark, but feel luxurious. The lobby is a snapshot of the 50's in the US... Loads of leather couches and chairs and smoking is perfectly acceptable (this bothered me, but to each his own). Meals were lovely but expensive.

We stayed at sofitels as well as 5 star riads and Hyatt Casablanca was just a class apart.

Hotel services were attentive and helpful, its location very good (easily reachable) and breakfast in the lounge was very fine indeed, offering a range of Arabic as well as European foods to choose from, along with Nespresso coffee. The hotel also features several restaurants, and the one we tried served decent french cuisine. The room itself was spacious and offered all amenities you'd otherwise expect, but also displayed a kind of neglect and lack of maintenance that was also apparent in the rest of the hotel.

I was offered an upgrade so my room was probably better equipped than standard, and the hotel offered free broadband wireless. I hope they do that for all the guests since paying for wireless when the roomrate is above 250 euros seems a little cheap.

From the moment first moment I stepped into the plush hotel lobby (3am!) the staff have always gone out of their way to look after me and my colleagues. I've stayed on every floor of the Hyatt and seen it through a refurb too. To be honest interior decoration is obviously lost on me because I hardly noticed the difference. However all the rooms were clean, tidy and very comfortable. I love the bathrooms although the shower drainage can be a little slow. No free internet either which for me is a disappointment at any hotel, whatever the star rating. The food at the Hyatt is excellent.

The rooms are fine and the breakfast spread is pretty good (although there were flies around the uncovered items every time I stayed and ate there over several weeks). The staff isn't very competent, however, and the concierge was pretty much useless for recommendations and information on places around town.

The service sub standard - we were ignored for 15 minutes in the lobby lounge bar area and one of the attendants even had the audacity to ask us if we were guest because he was hesitant to serve us! Every time house keeping came in they didn't knock and just threw open the door so help you if you were getting dressed or something. The gym is pointless and there are always staff in attendance which is nice but people staring at you while you are trying to work out is really awkward.

I do recommend that if you are visiting Casablanca that you visit the new mosque. Very interesting tour of a beautiful site of worship. If you want to say, I ate (or drank) at Ricks by all means go.

Our first impression was poor, in that the driveway was blocked - not by neatly uniformed doormen, but by hefty thugs in black suits, so we had to walk up from the road. Despite booking and prepaying for 4 rooms, we were greeted with the news that we were being sent to another hotel of an 'equal standard', as they were completely full, and 'guests were refusing to leave'.

The hot water came on instantly. The building itself is a rather unattractive 12-storey white concrete block on a busy square, right outside the medina and near the port.

I happened to fly through there, so I ended up staying a night. But given how grimy and rough that city is, I at least wanted to feel comfortable and happy. The bed- top notch. I slept like a baby. The food? Absolutely amazing. I recommend the moroccon restaurant. Get one of the Pastilles, and a tanginess.

Hassan II, a very busy street in the city centre. As such, the traffic was quite loud, which is also due to the fact, that Moroccons like to use their horn. The window glazing was not that good, so that the traffic could be clearly heard. This is the only critique I would point out. The king-size bed was very comfy and the bedding was clean and nice.

 December 2010,4,Nice Hotel,"Casablanca is the gateway to Morocco, you only go there because of the airport. The Hyatt is a nice hotel in a good location, it's clean, comfortable and meets the five star standard. We stayed in executive suite and could not fault the room. Breakfast was nice with a good selection of food, the area was a bit small and tables a bit low. We approached the counter in the evening to get a restaurant suggestion from the concierge to find there wasn't one available. Staff were friendly and we would definately recommend this hotel to start off your trip in Morocco.",Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hyatt_Regency_Casablanca,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2010,5,Best location,"Casa is not a beautiful city, and most downtown hotels are in crowded, dirty, very auto-polluted areas. The Hyatt is great because it is set back several hundred yards from all of this congestion, making it the best hotel location in the central downtown area. It is very clean and modern, with great rooms (updated, soundproof, great bathroom) and a great pool.

 October 2010,3,"sparkling clean, so why did I come away wanting a shower?","I can't complain (much), since I knew what I was getting into booking a ""luxury"" hotel in a place like Casablanca, but this place really kinda made me sad. It's sparkling clean, the room was perfectly luxurious, and service was always offered with a (tight-lipped, jaw-breaking) smile. The only structural oddity was the bathroom, which was separated from the main room by a glass door (the toilet has its own wood-doored room). This was very inconvenient when we arrived and I wanted to get a shower while my husband wanted to order room service. My dislike was somehow more ephemeral in nature. I don't expect a lot of character from large, chain establishments, especially in areas like Casablanca where some travelers specifically seek chains out in order to escape local ""charms.""

 August 2010,3,Very disappointed with this Hyatt stay,"The room was booked in exchange for a free weekend nights promo and if this was the reason for the poor room provided, then shame on the management. Anyway, after check-in I went up to the king room, which was spacious and well appointed but had a musty dank smell about it. I was tired and thought that the smell was probably hotel wide, so decided to make-do and not complain. This was a wrong decision as that night I was kept awake by a regular (every 20 mins or so) buzzing noise from outside the room which went through the entire night. Irritated after a sleepless night, I complained the next morning and was offered a similar replacement room but there was no genuine apology or acknowledgement of the problem.

The check in was good, I was offered a Regency Club access, the staff was very nice and they were always smiling and helpful, also I was welcomed by the duty manager. When I accessed the room which was a twin, I found one bed not made up which was a little bit disappointing, the pad was out and the pillow was in the middle not in the right place, on the other hand, there is not tea and coffee amenities, you need to order from room service, however the room has a great view and was overlooking the Great Hassan II Mosque and the Atlantic Ocean.

The excuses given were feeble and there was no manager in attendance. I suggested that they might want to give some drinks to the people who were waiting, which they did. Pity they had to be prompted. I finally got a room and it was fine...for a while. At about 9pm the music started at the Moroccan restaurant below and it went on until about 130am.

The bedrooms, though, were very average and nothing like the public areas. The Six PM bar was amazing. We loved the décor and atmosphere and also really enjoyed the meze in the Moroccan themed restaurant (Dar Beida). We had a number of problems with our first room. It was on the 7th floor and offered a fantastic view of the medina and mosque but the rooms above were being refurbished so there was lots of noise.

The second time he tried to drop me off at the same wrong terminal and I let him know that this was not correct. He was so insistent that I was wrong and he was right that he walked in to the terminal to the counter with me only than to confirm that yes it was in fact the wrong terminal.

 April 2010,5,The Ultimate in Casablanca,"The Hyatt Regency is where you MUST stay, IF you can afford it. It is a wonderful hotel. Well located, extremely professional and don't even think of skipping breakfast or having breakfast anywhere else. They upgraded us (wife's 50th), and the suite we had was plush. The only thing wrong with it was that the shower would not drain away the water as it wasn't levelled well but apart from that, we could see nothing amiss and a lot to commend (e.g.free shoe-polish) The Hotel needs to consider FREE internet access to all it's guests - not just the Regency Club (higher floor) guests. After 12 nights in Morocco, this was the only 5 star property we stayed in, doing this rather silly thing - charging guests for internet access. Very short-sighted!

 February 2010,4,The best of a bad bunch,"Having been to Casablanca about 15 times now, I have stayed in both the Starwood hotels (Sheraton & Royal Mansour) and the Hyatt Regency. As a businessman, the best choice has to be the Hyatt, 4/5 is generous but compared to what else is around. The restaurants are all better than the aforementioned offerings and the rooms more modern and cleaner. The Sheraton is old and dated. The Royal Mansour has a more traditional approach / entrance but the rooms are tired, old, dirty and in need of a makeover, i.e. in one room, I was taking a 50/50 risk using the plug as to whether I'd get electrocuted from all the wires sticking out!

Upon check out I was explained different options that I had for my next visit. Coming back to Hyatt this November, I decided to take for extra ~80$ the Regency Club room that seamed most fitted for my needs. This room type included the access to Regency Club that offered all those side amenities that we have a habit of taking and ending by paying a lot of money for.

The hotel was perfect for the children who spend a lot of time by the pool. I personally enjoyed a massage and a Hamman in the spa.

The staff were very helpful and most spoke very good English. We also used some of the facilities and note the following about them: The spa was on the average side - I did have a hammam which was excellent, but my friend has a massage which wasn't great. The pool is fantastic, we spent a wonderful afternoon lazing around drinking cocktails, one of the best poolside bars I've found. The concierge service is very efficient, although there was a mix up with the spa that saw up double booked - no big deal as the hammam replacement was fantastic.

Yes there was a lot of security, but nothing compared to our exit from Casablanca terminal 1. The security was reassuring. I was greeted by name at the front desk, registered and taken up to the Regency Club for a decent expanded continental breakfast. Our 9th floor city view room met (slightly exceed) my expectations for a Hyatt Regency. The bathroom was great. We liked the glass door and seperate WC.

The toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom, which is nice, but it was so small you had to stand on the toilet to get the door open. The shower/bath was separated from the bedroom by partial glass doors, so steam and noise were not contained and there was no privacy. Service was essentially non-existent. Granted, we were there during Ramadan, but even though we were happy to adapt to the shedule, we kept being told to come back to the restaurant an hour later until someone finally took pity on us and told us that we would not be served (despite a full room of diners eating heartily).

Once inside the hotel the security presence was not at all oppressive. Check in was quick and efficient and my room was spacious and appeared to have been recently refurbished.

We had a nice and very comfortable double bed with luxurious sheets; the perfect bed after a long day of plane travel. The only problem we had was the smelly toilet. Luckily the toilet was a separate room from the shower, tub and sink. Once you closed the door, you can't smell anything at all.

The hotel does not ""overlook"" the harbor, though it is close by, with the Medina and its many shops directly behind the back door. The lobby and common rooms have no windows and were dark and way too smoky. Some sort of ventilation system is needed! The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful.

Yes, the hotel is expensive. Breakfast approx 30 US$. I did not have dinner in the restaurant. Most nights just a drink and a snack in the lobby lounge (aka Living Room) which were reasonably priced. Internet access is also very expensive. Rooms were fairly large, like the typical American hotel room. Ordered breakfast one morning and never received it, but also was not charged for it. A billing problem was easily corrected during check-out.

 July 2007,4,French Hyatt,"I have just spent a week at the francophone version of Hyatt. Coffee is not available in your room. The Internet works but is crassly expensive at $30+ a day! or $0.80 a minute.

The food was good but a little pricey if you consider the country you are in. The service was a little slow as they seem to be always busy and not enough waiters. The breakfast was also very impressive. My room was comfortable and clean with a very impressive bathroom. Unfortunately I had a problem as the air conditioning was not working. That same evening I was moved to another room that was fine. It was a bit of an inconvenience but they did send 2 members of staff to help move my clothes.
