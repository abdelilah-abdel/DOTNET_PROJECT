 December 2022,5,Luxury in Town,"Such a treat!!! The hotel is beautiful - the interior courtyard where breakfast is served & the rooftop terrace in particular. You don't want to miss sunset on the roof. The service we had was top notch. The food was excellent. It is in a great location, too, so that you can walk to everything in the old Medina and the beach.",hotelName,city
 December 2022,5,Wonderful Hotel Perfectly Situated,"Absolutely fabulous hotel right against the Medina wall. Originally a palace and then an orphanage, lovingly restored. Rooms are small but well-appointed and very quiet. The staff were lovely and attentive. Dinner at the hotel was excellent. The bar was quiet and comfortable. Take advantage of the rooftop deck, especially when it's time for the call to prayer - you can hear it echoing all over the city. We love that they kept the courtyard here open to the sky. Everyone at the hotel was so kind and helpful. They also organized a wonderful tour for us with Hassane. If you drive here, you have to park outside of the Medina wall - call the hotel and they will send a porter out to help with your bags and show you where there is complimentary parking.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2022,4,Lovely quiet place to stay,"Our driver dropped us by the side of the road where a porter from the hotel was waiting to take our luggage and show us the short distance to the hotel. We entered the Medina by the Bab Marrakech gate and almost immediately on the right is the hotel. The hotel is built like a Riad with a large inner courtyard full of plants and seating and this is where the buffet style breakfast is served and also, on the occasion we ate in the hotel, where the evening meal was also served. We were in room 23 one of the premium suites. It had a small entrance area with table and seating which lead into the bedroom containing a very comfortable KSB, TV, safe, Air Con, another small seating area and loads of wardrobe space. There is also a good hotel wide WIFI signal. The main windows look out…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2022,2,Poor and expensive choice despite charms,"My wife and I have just returned from spending 5 nights here (preceded by several more in Marrakesh) and were very disappointed by the Heure Bleue, which is not at all up the the Relais and Châteaux standards. The historic hotel is nice enough, and the rooftop pool (and one of the staff members there) truly special, but everything else is disappointing. Most staff barely smile, (not the usual charm of Morocco) and seem confused by simple requests, and the format of breakfast and “order ahead” meals is monotonous and subpar. While Essaouira is charming and worth a visit, I’d avoid the Heure Bleue. Lastly, while it’s impossible to be precise, returning home with severe “gastrointestinal issues” makes me suspect that the hotel is failing on hygiene standards too.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2022,4,Lovely hotel but seemingly inherent problems,"This is, in the main, a lovely hotel, conveniently positioned at the Bab Marrakech, just inside the Medina of Essaouira. It has some terrific features, but a few things that also let it down. The hotel is in a riad style, with a lush central courtyard where you take breakfast, and can also have dinner. There is a dining room which is quite dark, and another bar across the courtyard. The breakfast is buffet style and very pleasant. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant one evening and the food and service were very good. The rooftop pool is a fabulous spot to enjoy the sunshine, although do not sit in the corner farthest from the pool (on the Medina wall side) - a dreadful gas smell wafts through intermittently! Compared to other poolside service we experienced while in Morocco,…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2022,4,Convenient Location,"Stayed here for two nights. Hotel is in an extremely convenient location. It’s a beautiful hotel. The breakfast was good and had lots of variety. Our room was very dark and that’s the only thing I didn’t like. Although we didn’t use it, there is a pool at this hotel but it was quite cool outside and the water isn’t heated.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2022,4,Very good indeed.,"Very conveniently situated by the gate to the Medina and just a few minutes' walk to the harbour though the Medina and its warren of tiny shops and stalls. Bedroom/suite was large, very well appointed with a sofa, chairs and coffee table and large wardrobes. But it did feel a little utilitarian. It was one of the few hotels we'd been to where there was ample space for two suitcases however! Bed extremely comfortable Our room had a small lobby area with a desk though for some bizarre reason the electric sockets are routed through the main light switch, so USB charging was impossible at the desk overnight. Bedrooms accessed in the manner of a riad via galleries situated around a very pleasant inner courtyard area with palm trees and large plants. Stairwells look rather stark and…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2022,5,Excellent Service at a Great Location,"The hotel is perfectly located right next to the gate to the Medina, a 10 minutes walk to the old fishermen port and a minute from the Medina shops. Our classic room was small but tastefully furnished, the shower was spacious, there were 2 USB sockets by a small desk. Sitting choices were limited and uncomfortable. I am giving the hotel a 5 star mainly owing to the excellent service. They took great care of our needs, provided a bottle of disinfecting alcohol liquid which is very useful while Covid is still around and is not usually provided in hotel rooms. The inner courtyard is tranquil however looking up from the courtyard on the rooms above, the walls were in need of new paint, the hotel appeared Warren down from that view point. Some of the plants in the courtyard looked…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2022,5,Old World Charm,"What a joy to stay at this hotel. You are greeted and served a beverage immediately on arrival. The hotel manager greeted us and provided information about the hotel and locations of the restaurants and services. At night, the center courtyard is lite up with colored lights which gives the hotel a magical feeling. Rooms are air conditioned and Wi-Fi works well.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2022,5,Old world charm with modern standards,"Charming hotel in the old city, built around a central courtyard, it exudes old style sophistication. ( An English bar complete with studded animal heads and a billiard room complete the vibe). Excellent service and restaurant recommendations for dining other than at its own restaurant (also very good) made our stay a delight. There is also a roof top pool and sun terrace which allow you to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2022,5,The sophisticated side of Essaouira,"Luxury inside the Essaouira Medina. An amazing building from the 19 century, now is a sophisticated hotel to discover Essaouira from inside. They provide you a warm welcome at the beautiful garden with fresh orange juice and local products while they are doing the check in. We were delighted with a very kind staff and manager, large and nice rooms and a great swimming pool at the rooftop. They have as well a hamman and restaurant that probably is super nice but we didn’t have the chance to try as we stayed just for one night. Amazing breakfast too, with fresh orange juice, fruits, different kind of breads, bakery and so… Totally worthy",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2022,4,Luxury Hotel just inside the Medina,"Great Hotel just inside the Medina wall. - Friendly staff- we had a two night stay - The reception, the inner courtyard, and the bar rooms are all done extremely well  Our Room: - Small not tiny- One Exterior window in the bathroom that was maybe 24inch h by 8 inches wide - They chose form over function, it had a decorative sitting table with two pillow stools in the corner of an already small room. - Very nice amenities, Illy Coffee Pods etc. The rooftop: - decent views of the surrounding area, you can see the sea from some spots - Comfortable cabana chairs, they could use more umbrellas, the English couple next to us had to sit two chairs apart in order for both of them to get some shade. - the pool was okay, 5ft deep all around.

 July 2022,5,"L'Heure Bleue Palais, Essaouira","We wanted a really comfortable hotel in Essaouria with a 5 star feel and facilities. The pool made such a difference, especially as it is on top of the hotel, on the 4th floor, overlooking the town. The hotel is literally on the Medina wall, just inside and sit you can be in the thick of it in a few steps. Its easy to access anywhere from here. It proved a very comfortable escape from the markets and hubbub of this fabulous town on the coast and it was so nice to return each day to our hotels. Our rooms were light and spacious and comfortable. They were able to arrange an interconnecting room for my son which was perfect. Again, really attention to the customer, nothing too much trouble, friendly staff and good concierge service. We would definitely stay here again. Highly…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2022,1,Gorgeous building and location but food and especially service not the level expected,"The location right in the Medina and the stunning building left us expecting a real treat upon entering this outstanding Riad. Unfortunately we were very quickly disappointed…. The hotel staff downstairs were charming, smiley and helpful however the service on the rooftop restaurant was absolutely not what we expected of a high class and very expensive hotel…. The waitress first of all didn’t come to ask what we wanted for 30 minutes, then she wanted our food order. We said we would first drink our aperitif but she still came back 4 times!! We then placed our food order at the same time as our second aperitif. Mistake as the food appeared before we had finished…. The second time we came, she did not take note of our order, and despite us repeating it we found ourselves receiving…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2022,4,Great place to stay in Essaouira.,"The hotel is really well situated as it’s the very first building you come to inside the old walled city or medina. The old town is quite compact and from the hotel, it’s only 5 mins to the very heart of the medina, and a further 6/7 minutes to the busy port - which is certainly worth visiting. The layout is that of a conventional Riad with a large colonnaded open courtyard and all rooms facing inward to the atrium. Breakfast is served in this courtyard. We had a lovely large room on the third floor - there is a lift. Above this there is a roof terrace with a bar and a pool. The pool is at one side of the roof so it doesn’t dominate the roof space. There is a bar downstairs but it’s all very dark wood, dark furniture and darkly lit - rather like a gentleman’s club of old.…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2022,5,Unforgettable stay.,"Unforgettable stay. Perfect location to explore the town. Room was very comfortable and full of character. Public spaces such as the lounges and dining areas are tranquil and beautiful. Breakfast was excellent and extra-special on Easter Sunday with a stunning display of treats. Every member of the staff team was outstanding and a credit to the hotel’s management, with an attention to detail and warm manner: attentive without being intrusive.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2022,5,Excellent hotel and service.,"Probably the best hotel on our 2+ weeks Moroccan tour. Very specious and comfortable rooms and bathrooms. Excellent location. Breakfast with almost everything you need or want. High class restaurant for lunch or dinner, with great ambiance and menu. Highly recommended if in the area.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2022,5,Beautiful riad in Essaouira,"We stayed here two nights while in Essaouira. The location is just inside the walls of the medina so easy to access from parking and our car. The building was renovated and expanded from an old riad. Beautiful property. Our room had a separate entry area, sitting area with fireplace, bedroom and bath - basically a suite. We had breakfast here - excellent and spent time in the lovely library, which had a great fireplace to enjoy on a rainy night. Staff was very professional and helpful. This was one of the few places we visited in Morocco with elevators.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2021,5,Simply the best!,"This is one of those rare opportunities when I wish it were possible to give six stars! The hotel is like a riyad, a haven of tranquillity just inside the city walls, but there is parking available at a short distance. The room (get a suite, it's worth it!) was spacious and decorated stylishly in keeping with local tradition. The restaurant offers gastronomic delights and the service is just first-rate -- friendly and professional. Now, you may wonder, this is all very well, but why the call for six stars? Well, I unfortunately broke my ankle during our stay in Essaouira and the director and all the staff went way beyond the call of duty to assist in every way they could (accompanying me to the clinic, etc.) to make me feel comfortable. It really made a difference at a…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2021,3,Overpriced hotel that lacks Moroccan charm,"I stayed at many places over the course of three weeks in Morocco. HB was the most expensive and least charming. Place feels a bit stale and sterile and staff a bit stiff. The location and breakfast are very good, but that's about it. Not good value",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2021,5,Excellent location and service,"L heure bleue is in the Medina of Essaouira, the perfect location to explore on foot the Medina, the port ( not to be missed) and the remparts.

The spa was excellent and so was the restaurant, including breakfast. All in all an excellent experience.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2021,5,An Unforgettable Experience,"Essaouira. This is one of several locations typically included as a day trip on many Moroccan tours, in this instance from Marrakech. It is often offered along with other options, such attending a cooking school where you can learn to make typical Moroccan dishes, or a day of pampering at your hotel spa. I made the choice to stay in Essaouira because there is a Relais et Chateaux hotel there, L’Heure Bleue Palais, and so I knew this would be a special place. The hotel had been closed briefly and being at the end of Ramadan, the hotel was not yet re-opened, but when we inquired about the possibility of my staying with them, they more than graciously offered to open a day early to accommodate my stay, yet another clue that this experience was going to be exceptional. …",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2021,5,Hidden gem,"Stayed overnight, very convenient location with easy car parking and straight out to medina. Within seconds you are in the “jungle” and within seconds you are in an “oasis”. Hotel has great facilities which we enjoyed like a cigar room with piano, rooftop bar with a pool & sunbath area, riad type patio and even fireplace inside your rooms. Service was also amazing. Will come again",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2021,5,Character filled,"A wonderful choice to stay in Essaouira. Easy access with a guarded parking lot just outside the hotel. Well appointed rooms and public spaces, sort of an old English colonial look and feel. I will say that the heated pool is still a little cool for American tastes.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2021,5,Top Notch Service in Essaouria!,"I spent 2 nights at Huere Bleue Palais towards the end of my trip to Morocco. The hotel is beautifully appointed and they truly thought about everything one might need in a hotel room. They even did a nightly turndown service as well as a departure gift (bottled water and some of their homemade cookies!). The service here was impeccable. Naima answered all of my questions and even helped me get a PCR Covid test (for my return to the states). She was friendly and informative! I had sprained my ankle the day before arriving there, and when I asked for ice for it, within minutes they were at my door with ice in a vacuum sealed bag - perfect for what I needed. I had dinner there my first night, and it was absolutely incredible. They started me off with an amuse bouche of a melon…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2021,5,Great experience,"I was in Essaouira twenty years ago. The city has changed and developed a lot. Its becoming more and more crowded. This hotel was an incredible finding. Inside the gates of the castle L´heure Bleu is a great choice for someone that values a little bit of peace and “luxury” after the outside experiences. The rooms are not big and have the issues of any rooms in a converted building. But service is impeccable, the front desk was incredible delivering everything in a short time and all the amenities are premium. Being there make sure you have the time to look at both main rooms in the ground floor. They are incredible craftmanship masterpieces. By the way, the hotel restaurant was the best restaurant we went during our stay in Essaouira. A great surprise.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2021,5,Best place to end our trip in Morocco!,"We felt so fortunate to spend the last three nights of our summer adventure in Morocco at this hotel. The two suites could not have been more perfect for our family of six to fully immerse ourselves in the gorgeous, easy-going vibe of the medina in Essaouira. The hotel staff were always gracious and accommodating, and we particularly loved the design and decor of this hotel since they manage to keep so many of the details from prior periods alive like the lovely tinted windows with single pane window shutters. Would highly recommend a stay at this hotel and city if possible!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2020,5,Best staff ever....,"The staff really makes a difference. From the moment we walked in, through the tour of the property, to the excellent restaurant and courtyard dining, to remarkably fast room service, to the comfortable and quiet rooms, the cherry on top of our wonderful stay here was the staff and the friendly, accommodating people who work here. My room was comfortable and quiet with nice appointments. You might hear some street sounds during the busy day, but my room was very quiet at night and I slept without any interrruptions. Everything I ate was absolutely delicious and served with expert hospitality. There is no doubt this will be my home away from home when I'm in Essa.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2020,5,"Great Location, Large Rooms","This is a very nice hotel just inside the Medina walls. The location is great and the rooms are large and well appointed.

 February 2020,5,Great value for old school elegance & service,"The location, immediately inside the Bab al Marrakech, is extremely convenient -- allowing ready access for walking out into the Medina, to the beach and the city. Our room was lovely and elegant but with modern conveniences. Best of all, however, was the quality of the service from the hotel staff. We enjoyed an exquisite, private couple's hammam and massage. And, when I phoned the concierge from the middle of the Medina, seeking a last minute restaurant recommendation for lunch, she was unfazed and quickly provided advice and clear directions for a couple of nearby alternatives. Having L'Heure Bleu as our sanctuary made the whole experience of Essaouira wonderful.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 January 2020,5,"Unique, calm hotel located right in the Medina.",This hotel is perfectly located right by Bab Marrakech gate into the Medina. You step off the crowded streets and into an oasis of calm. This hotel has got a lot of character and immediately makes you feel at home and relaxed. The best part is the roof top with a heated pool and amazing views over the medina and out to sea. The rooms all have a lot of character and history about them and overall it was a great stay. I would recommend to anyone visiting Essaouira.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2020,5,Great visit,Everyone at L'Heure Bleue went out of their way to be sure our stay was excellent. The room was spotless and spacious. The breakfasts were delicious and generous. Everyone at the front desk was helpful and kind. I would highly recommend this riad/hotel and would definitely stay here again. Thank you all for a great visit.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2020,3,Spa Treatment,"Average quality of service, hammam wasn’t the real “discovery”, the sauna room was bautiful and warm but the scrub was very fast and the room where I have been scrubbed felt cold after the steam room. The massage therapist didn’t seem to be experienced as her touch and technique felt a bit mechanical and anxious, massage room is so small that she kept bumping on the table. Overall nice as I ended up clean and relaxed enough but not up the the expectations, I had the same quality of services in more affordable places and this was supposed to feel like a treat but it didn’t 🤷🏻‍♀️",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2020,5,Super relaxing time!,"My husband and I have spent three nights at this hotel, one of the best we have ever been at. The attention to detail, the hospitality, the relaxing atmosphere... all make for the perfect stay. After a few days in busy Marrakech and a long trip to the desert, staying at HB was like arriving at an oasis for us. The rooms are very comfy (we had the deluxe room) and breakfast is just amazing. Thank you to all the team at the hotel for your efforts!!!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 October 2019,4,Charming Small Hotel in the Old Town,We spent two nights at this charming hotel with a lovely rooftop pool and bar. The classic rooms are small but nicely decorated. The excellent hotel restaurant is around an interior garden. The bar is nice and they have a piano player at night. The location is close to the beach and the old market. The hotel is pretty and convenient. I would highly recommend this hotel.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2019,5,Beautiful Oasis on the edge of the bustling Medina.,"We stayed here for 5 nights. We have enjoyed every minute of our stay. It is on the edge of the Medina opposite the car park, we drove from Marrakech. You can walk everywhere. Essaouira is a lovely place. The hotel is so full of atmosphere, we thought very well kept due to its age. Staff were helpful & always smiling. Breakfasts were fabulous, so much choice. Pool has luxurious towels. New Wi-fi has been installed whilst we were here and is fast! Agree with the fine dining- just not our ‘cup of tea’. We ate in the Medina for lunch & had a snack from room service in the evening. Our room over looked the walls & was great. Really enjoyed our stay.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2019,4,Interesting stay,"My husband and I had three nights here at the end of our travels in Morocco. It was definitely more posh than we needed with fancy people sitting around sipping cognac and smoking cigarettes in the courtyard like they were in an old film in Casablanca, but it was fun to watch! They have all the great comforts you'd expect for the price - rooms are fully supplied with endless coffee and water and snacks, slippers, robes, lovely bath products. We were so cold during our stay we had multiple baths in the large tub. They returned our laundry much quicker than we expected on our fist day which was a nice surprise. The food wasn't the best we'd experienced while in Morocco but still lovely. The setting in the courtyard for dinner was more spectacular than the food. Thoroughly enjoyed…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2019,5,Stunning hotel in the medina!,"A friend and I stayed at L’Heure Bleue for three nights in November and loved it, the hotel feels like a palatial embassy with dark wooden cosy rooms that are a haven from the windy beach in Essaouira, the courtyard is just beautiful and a perfect place to have breakfast (grab a heater if you’re there in winter!). The rooftop pool has lovely views and is a quiet spot for lunch or a cocktail, even in the wind they have some covered alcoves. Our room was huge and even had a lovely window seat over looking the courtyard with original (I assume!) wooden screens and little glass windows. Our bathroom was fit for a king with big double sinks, a bath, separate shower and separate toilet room.

 November 2019,3,Falls short compared to other experiences in Morocco.,"The rooms are okay and the hotel is well located but it was the only place we stayed where the service was sub-par. We requested water several times, called more than 2 times about coffee machine not working. No one wrote anything down so I am sure they forgot. The hotel seemed more than 1/2 empty and the front desk had no ideas about dinner suggestions. All that said, the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Not sure whether it would be better in summer. All and all this was not my favorite city.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2019,3,Nice hotel,"Essaouira is a very nice city by the ocean , we choose to stay in this hotel because of the location, it is well designed and near the old souq , rooms are spacious, specially those looking the road .

Breakfast is very limited.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2019,4,Lovely place in need of TLC,The staff and courtyard are lovely. The pool which was supposed to be open until 6. The cushions were taken away at 4::45. The towels in the pool area and for the beach need an upgrade. But the one glaring issue especially for a Relais property is the inability to control the air conditioning. There is essentially none. While the building is old perhaps it is time to figure out an improvement to this.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2019,5,The best located hotel in Essaouira,"It may not be PC to refer to Europe’s colonial past but walking into this beautiful hotel one cannot help but feel transported to that era. With its colonnades, courtyard garden and English bar complete with wood panelled walls and leather arm chairs it’s an experience worth travelling to Essaouira for. The hotel is in a perfect location within the Médina but right by the wall so easy to access and quiet but within walking distance of the souk and restaurants. If you are coming here from within Morocco I can recommend the super efficient air conditioned state coach company- Supratours. The stop is a 2 minute walk from the hotel and you don’t need a porter with “un chariot” but beware there will be a fight over you when you step off the coach. A firm “Non merci” will suffice. …",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2019,1,Needs an update,"As mentioned by many others, the courtyard is beautiful and location is good. But the room we stayed in, was quite outdated. Scratches everywhere, the rug was shredding in pieces. And the AC thermostat was a joke, you could not select a temperature. Need more light inside the room. We had a deluxe twin room. However, the beds were extremely small, if you were turning on your side, you will fall off the bed. Zero view whatsoever, we were lucky to have an outdoor window, but you could only see the parking lot (disappointing). Breakfast was by far the worst we had in our entire 14 day tour.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2019,4,Outstanding Riad.,"The inner courtyard of this beautiful Riad is extraordinarily attractive, with a multitude of plants. Diners eat their breakfasts in this courtyard in this setting. Breakfast is buffet, but orders for hot items can be placed. although our room was attractive, its location allowed us to hear people outside in the Medina or piano playing in the lobby which is why 5 star is not awarded. An upgraded room is recommended to assure quiet. It is, though, a highly attractive Riad in a great location.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2019,5,Superb,"Service, location, food was fantastic. All personnel at hotel were incredible. The location in the medina could not be beat. The staff anticipated our needs & went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2019,5,Excellent experience in a traditional palace,"Magnificent palace full of history and charme. The culinary experience made the real difference, with a delicious mix of local ingredients, innovative cuisine by the Moroccan chef and an excellent service. We enjoyed very much our stay even if the room is very noisy on top of the kitchen and too close to the laundry. The rooftop terrace is very nice too, the personnel is extremely gentle and the food, again, worth the visit. The pool is small but pleasant. The room service is a bit rough, and we had to ask for a better service. The weather during our visit was very windy and spoiled a bit our experience. The music in the evening was very pleasant, too. We suggest a better acoustic for improving the room comfort. Overall an excellent experience, we will be back!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2019,1,Overpriced and dated with poor service,"We stayed for two nights. The hotel is very dated and needs a complete overhaul. The rooms are dark and the only thing in the mini bar was two small bottles of water. The bar on the roof is supposed to close at 6pm (not sure why as most in the city open late) but when we went up there with friends around 5.45pm the waiter told us his shift was finished and made it clear he didn’t want to serve us. All the cushions for the benches, chairs etc were all put away already and so we ended up dragging them out and setting up the table ourselves. The lunch we had up there on the day we arrived was bland and my boyfriend’s had to be sent back as he is allergic to egg and his burger for some reason arrived with slices of egg in it. The waiter wasn’t happy when we explained this but he did…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2019,5,"Best hotel in the city - luxury, service, location - everything!","Bottom line: fantastic luxury right inside Essaouria medina. Delightful, luxurious, great service. Enthusiastic recommendation! Here is more detail. Our travel group consisted of a total of two families, each with two parents and two kids. The kids were aged 13 and 11. We were on a two week trip through Morocco. We are seasoned travelers and have stayed in a wide range of accommodations. We eagerly wanted to stay inside the medina in Essaouria. From our research, this seemed like the ""must stay"" hotel. It deserves the title! The location is superb. Right inside the old medina walls, easy walking throughout the entire medina, about a 7 minute walk to the nearest beach. We found Essaouria to be a delightful town.

 July 2019,5,Heaven!,"I booked two nights here seeking tranquility and a bit of pampering after a 12 day tour of Morocco. From a gracious welcome in the beautiful courtyard to a well appointed and quiet room with all the amenities to the gem of a spa, L’Heure Bleue exceeded my every expectation. The staff went above and beyond assisting with tours and confirmations for my onward travel. Advance emails to the spa resulted in very helpful advice about scheduling treatments in the evening. The breakfast buffet features something for every possible taste and the pastries were a delight. Finally, the roof top pool was a perfect place to relax after touring. Do treat yourself to lunch there!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2019,5,A great hotel,"From the outside doesn’t look nice, so I was worried but once in, everything is beautiful, the gardens and rooms are great, service is superb and the swimming pool on the rooftop has spectacular view of the city. Recommended!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2019,5,The hotel that sets the bar for elegance and charm,"My husband and I spent 2 nights here during our travels in Morocco....our only regret was not being able to stay longer. It was so perfect in every way. The rooms were gorgeous and very clean, the location was excellent and just a short walk from the beach, and the staff was so helpful and classy. There were so many little touches in service that took the level from being great to being outstanding without being pretentious. I told my husband that this hotel is the hotel all other hotel employees should come to train and learn how to provide quality customer service. Their breakfast is superior to any other hotel breakfast we had in Morocco and their rooftop pool, deck and bar is the perfect, private escape from the bustle of the market. While we were there, the general…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2019,2,"Everything was ""Just Fine""","A Bit of a disappointment.to stay at L’Heure Bleu, which has a great location just inside the Medina but the property is overdue for an upgrade. The property still boasts a Relais & Chateaux badge but I have to say the place could use an update. The rooms were fine and the breakfast was fine and the bedding was fine and the pool area was fine and the internet was awful but the showers were great….so you decide based on your priorities. There are other newer hotel options located outside of the that I might decide to stay otherwise.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2019,5,An oasis!,"Stayed 2 nights on a road trip. Parking is free and just outside the walls. Welcome tea and cakes delicious. Room was very comfortable with phenomenal shower. The roof terrace has very comfortable sun loungers, and there’s a nice bar where you can offer food and drinks. We ate st the hotel restaurant 1 night, it was so so, probably because I didn’t really like much on the menu, but the atmosphere was nice and the service good. Also had a drink in the library which was pleasant. You can buy cigars there too if you wish. Breakfast was a delicious buffet with eggs and pancakes made to order. Great espresso.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2019,5,Excellent,"We first stayed in a well rated Riad in Essaouira and then decided to give us an upgrade. Absolutely clean and nice hotel, friendly staff and a breakfast under Palm trees. We checked the ratings before and I can honestly not understand how some folks were downrating this hotel. It's excellent and probably the best adress to stay in Essaouira",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2019,5,Médina hotel of quality,"A small group of friends had a very enjoyable stay at this quality hotel just inside the Médina walls. The staff were very friendly and considerate of our needs at all times. A beautiful Riad style courtyard was a great place for breakfast with a nice range of local and international foods on offer. We had one dinner in the restaurant that was a mix of international and Moroccan food, while expensive by local standards, was of a high standard. Staff even put the dining room fire on which added to the atmosphere even though it wasn’t very cold. A very enjoyable stay for all of our party in a very conveniently located large Riad in the Médina that is easily accessible for arriving guests.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2019,5,1st Class Hotel,"We have visited l'Heure Bleue,Essaouira on two occasions and on both visits the service, hospitality and attention to detail was of the highest standard. The choice of food for buffet breakfast is very good (but be aware the courtyard can be quite cool so some warm clothing may prove to be useful).",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2019,3,Charming but in need of an update,Full of character but in need of a bit of TLC especially in the bathroom and the pool terrace. Staff are friendly and helpful. Location is good if a little noisy at night. Breakfast average but dinner on the terrace was good ( can be a bit chilly - take a sweater!).,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,A Moroccan Jewel,"This was by far our favorite hotel in Morocco, complemented by the fact that Essaouira is just such an excellent place to visit. From welcome to departure the staff treated us extremely well and our room, a junior suite, was outstanding. Located just inside one of the main entrances to the medina their restaurant is excellent and breakfast is served in an open atrium buffet style, which is outstanding. Book this hotel and you will not be disappointed.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2019,5,Weekend in Essoauria,Sweet hotel in the heart of the city. French Colonial with lovely public areas and a very nice breakfast. Suite Rooms were very comfy and nice bathrooms. A great rooftop pool area with very relaxed vibe and good food and wine. Staff were excellent.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,Good choice in Essaouria,"My wife and I spent two nights in Essaouria after some days in Marrakesh. L'Heure Bleue Palais was a very pleasant place to stay. It is just in the beginning of the main street of the medina, so it is very practical if you have luggage and it is easy to find. The building is absolutely stunning. It is like in a movie set. The roof terrace is a nice place to relax, but in April the sea breeze was still rather cold. It is not the cheapest place to stay in town, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay for a few days it is worth it. We enjoyed Essaouria very much. It is not as hectic as Marrakesh and the people are a lot friendlier. We would recommend people to only to visit Marrakesh, but also go to Essaouria and this is a good place to stay.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,Stunning place,Great location in the walls so close to everything. Beautiful building well looked after real luxury. The rooms are small but the most comfortable bed with lovely clean linen. The bathroom is good great shower the soap is amazing. Beds drawn back at night with a chocolate on pillow. Great choice at breakfast served in the courtyard.Staff are very friendly and helpful and gave us a lunch box when we left.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,Holiday,"I was immediately amazed by the location. But the thing that struck me most was (besides the beauty) kindness and willingness to help me solve some of the tasks I had, the girl works at the reception: named haasma.In 2 minutes solved the problem for me.Brava and super in his work.Thanks.

 March 2019,5,Gorgeous oasis,"This hotel is all colonial architecture, charm and class. You’re greeted with delicious tea and cookies in the stunning atrium that has a full tropical garden. The rooftop boats a pool the color of the sea with lounge areas fit for reading and relaxing the warm Moroccan air. The breakfast is not to be missed. We enjoyed cocktails in the lounge at night with a fire and sunk into the beautiful leather couches and felt a million miles from everywhere, in the best way!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2019,4,Beautiful building but tiny beds!,"I stayed as part of a small group trip. This was our last stop. Staff were excellent, very friendly and attentive. Great selection of food at breakfast but poor coffee. Lovely roof terrace with large pool and great views. Room was really hot with no means of controlling temperature and the single beds were tiny! A couple of personal niggles; don’t like flower petals strewn around and didn’t like the fact that a member of staff came into the room so often. Probably my fault for not using the “do not disturb” sign.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2019,5,Perfect blend of old and new,"We escaped the hustle and bustle of Marrakech to the coast Unseasonally hot in Morocco, the brief escape to the coast was a great idea . No better place than Essouira No beter place to stay than here in area. Perfect location on an old/ historic building that has been upgraded to provide everything the 21st century traveller could want whilst decor in public areas has been maintained at a period style to reflect the buildings age and history. The internal courtyard is just beautiful. Swimming pool and terrace is a lovely relaxing area too. - sun and shade available. Bedrooms are comfortable and well furnished. Dining room is tradition and elegant. Romantic too. Excellent quality food tho it is charged at quite a premium. Staff delightful in all areas.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2019,5,Amazing riad in Essaouria medina,"This definitely is a haven of calm just inside the medina gate. A huge courtyard in the centre where you can relax, eat and drink. Everywhere has magnificent tiling and the bar and restaurant fabulous carved wooden ceilings. Fires were lit when weather turned a bit chilly. Our room was very nice with all you require in it. Breakfast buffet is amazing and included in the price. The staff were very friendly and welcoming with always a smile and a greeting. The restaurant menu looked good but was far too expensive for us so we ate out. Loads of reasonably priced and good restaurants to choose from locally.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2018,2,Can’t decide if it’s indifference or complacency,"The hotel is a lovely building and the location at the edge of the old city is a good one and it is easy to locate amongst the maze of narrow streets and alleys. The room was also quite comfortable and although quite large, did feel quite cramped because of the way it was laid out and the ‘stuff’ that was crammed in. MYbe also because the main windows face into the riad and you are very much open to the corridor if you do t keep the windows closed, making it dark. The service however is amateurish at best and unpleasant at worst. Although are driver did phone to let the hotel know we were arriving and a staff member to come to meet us in the car park, they were happy to stand and watch as we struggled with our bags up to and into the hotel. OK we have been spoiled by the…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2018,5,Perfect December stay,Wonderful old school hotel with charming and attentative staff. Common areas are excellent and we spent more time at the hotel than we had planned. Rooms are spacious (we had the basis room category) clean and cool. Good location inside the medina.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2018,5,love it! best staff in Maroc,"a week or ten days there in January each year is a great post-Christmas healer with just Maroc gold, seafood and no alcohol. unless windsurfing you do not swim in the sea. the wind is too much and bloody cold. there is a walled pool and bar at the top of the hotel. one thing, thoigh, the main restaurant is good but expensive, so if staying for a week just have one dressed-up blow out there otherwise eat out for less than a third of the price (or less, with locals). the restaurant in the harbour is the best but book ahead",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2018,3,Not Up To Snuff,"L'Heure Bleu Palais is a Relais et Chateau Hotel, but it is not up to usual Relais et Chateau standards. The rooms are not especially attractive, the lighting is poor and the whole place needs shaping up. Set in an old Moroccan palace on the edge of the Medina, L'Heure Bleu offers excellent breakfasts in the main courtyard with a pretty young woman who makes Moroccan pancakes and delicious fresh OJ as well as a large display of pastries and fruit. The dinners are not outstanding.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 October 2018,4,Lovely Hotel That Could be Better,We stayed in room 38 for 2 nights. It was a lovely room - just wished the air conditioning worked better - hot and stuffy. The bathroom was large - but the configuration of the shower was very weird - small and slippery. The sunset view from the rooftop/pool area was lovely but that area needs to be redone and updated. The overall hotel ambiance is very 1940’s and we liked it. Breakfast is served in the inner courtyard/atrium. It is buffet as well as served eggs. The bar area is all dark woods and animal trophies - the cocktails were delicious. We also had dinner in the hotel and the food was absolutely delicious. The hotel location was perfect. We were able to walk everywhere.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2018,4,A Beautiful Hotel Much Improved ....,". We visited this hotel around 8 years ago, and although the hotel was beautiful it was let down by snotty dismissive management and things that didn't function. In truth we never wanted to return, but ended up back here due to bizarre circumstances. And what a big relief. Essaouira has has become a much nicer place, and the hotel has a different manager who is very personable and helpful. We also found all the staff very pleasant and accommodating. We think the hotel quite beautiful and worthy of a few days stay to properly relax in and appreciate. It's a place of peace and tranquility. I'm very confused by some reviews that state the hotel is shabby and in need of updating. Far from it. It's a lovely period character property with history. To update it or modernise it…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2018,5,Stunning,"Lovely room. Met by the General Manager just after check-in for a chat. We talked the GM several times. He is charming, with a lovely smile and a trade mark burnt orange scarf, and makes you feel very much at home. Fabulous food in the restaurant through Chef Ahmed. Some dishes were a revelation both in taste and appearance. He is a very clever and modest man. We wish him well with developing new recipes that he has planned. The hotel is just inside the medina and very close to everything - walking everywhere is fine with no need for transport around the town. Two little things were not quite right: first, there was nowhere to rest suitcases in the room (other than on the floor) and insufficient storage to unpack. Secondly, the safe was not screwed down. Those two little…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2017,5,Wonderful Hospitality,"We stayed here for 4 nights in December including New Year's Eve. The hotel service and staff were amazing, among the best I've ever experienced. The manager was very present at all breakfasts, engaging with guests and learning about our trip. Having traveled extensively, it was a really pleasant sense of involvement and personal attention to guests' needs. Great location as well. Interiors of rooms are beautiful - windows to exterior are small.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2018,3,good hotel in serious need of updating,"This hotel is situated in the Medina, which makes it an excellent choice for touring the historic section of Essaouria. However, the hotel is in great need of updating and refurbishing. It is certainly not up to the high standard one expects from a Relais Chateaux hotel, or any four or five star property. The standard room that we stayed in was extremely small and barely functional. I have stayed in 3-star hotels that were nicer and cleaner. The safe did not work, and it had to be changed three times before an operative one could be found. The toilet did not flush well either. The room smelled moldy and there was no ventilation in the bathroom so that after you took a shower the bathroom was totally moist and disgusting. Shampoos and other bathroom lotions were stored in large…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2018,4,Relaxing stay,"We had a relaxing stay here. Certain parts of the hotel feel tired/dated and may need a gentle ""Facelift"". We enjoyed the billiards room although the table needs replacing. Good breakfast. Lovely views from the rooftop and decent lunch food albeit in my view slightly overpriced. They could make more of the amazing rooftop - we took beers up there to enjoy the sunset.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2018,4,An Oasis of Calm in Morocco,"This hotel was a wonderful find. Extremely helpful staff, very friendly, clean and with a beautiful roof terrace and pool. A wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the town. They provided us with a lovely gesture on departure in the form of a goody bag with small bottles of water and the wonderful almond biscuits we had enjoyed during our stay. Would highly recommend.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2018,4,"Excellent service, great location","The centrepiece courtyard is fabulous ( outdoor dining), the food is good, and the location is super convenient being just inside the medina. Free parking a short distance away. And the service is attentive and extremely helpful - I needed to find someone to polish the superficial scratches off my rental car, and they drove me to a garage where it was cleaned. The indoor restaurant, bar and rooms are a bit old fashioned - decor is like an old gentleman's club from the 1940's. The rooftop pool hours are limited - I like an early or late swim but the pool doesn't open until 10am and closes at 6pm ( even though it is light until after 8pm). And the price for the laundry is exhorbitant. Despite these qualms, an excellent place to stay.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2018,2,Very disappointing,The hotel is tired and dirty. The service is ordinary. I cannot believe I trusted this to be the usual Relais & Chateaux hotel experience. What a joke. Relais & Chateaux... are you kidding me. I actually left two days early due to this very disappointing hotel.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,Super Location,"The hotel is lovely and in a great location. The rooms are a little on the small size compared with many others we have stayed in - more like Parisian sizes than those of other European cities. The staff were helpful and polite. The pool area was excellent. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. All in all, a very good way to end our honeymoon in Morocco.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2018,4,Charming Hotel in great location,The hotel is located in the center of the town and at short distance from everything you wished to see in Essauira. The building is ancient and full of charm with a patio and a roof terrace absolutely beautiful. The room was good overall but a perfume was covering a bit of humidity smell and the noise isolation was weak. Breakfast was very good.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2018,5,"Stunning riad style hotel, in fantastic location!","This is by far the best hotel/riad we stayed in during our 9 day trip to Morocco and overall, probably one of my all time favourites of all hotels that i've stayed in. From the moment we arrived, the service was amazing and it continued throughout our stay. As we arrived very late in the evening after a delayed flight, we checked in and went straight to bed, so the following morning was really the first time we actually saw how beautiful the hotel really was. Breakfast in the centre courtyard was lovely and the food was simply delicious. We ordered omelettes and enjoyed watching the lady freshly cook Moroccan pancakes, yet not nearly as much as eating them (I think this was the highlight of our mornings)! We were served hot tea/coffee, along with fresh orange juice and enjoyed…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 May 2018,5,Amazing,"My wife and I sadly only had 1 night at this amazing hotel and it was the highlight of our week in Morocco The building alone with its history is worth a visit and being located inside the old Médina was a big bonus We arrived by bus from Marrakech and surrendered to one of the guys with a cart who took our bags to the hotel, the walk took 15 minutes and cost us 50 MAD as we had no idea where our hotel was and there is no vehicle access inside the walls of the Médina We discovered later that day that our hotel is just inside a main entrance and only 50 metres from the bus stop so don’t fall for the cart guys! The traders are all friendly and polite and the smells, tastes and sights of this wonderful place are a treasure to experience and the prices cheaper than Marrakech and…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2018,5,ONE OF THE BEST FINDS IN MOROCCO!,"This pleasant, and quiet Riad style hotel, is located within the walls of the Medina and on a street of the Souk. You are greeted by a..”sincere welcoming to your home away from home.” Service is both friendly, and exceptional, and only surpassed by the incredulous quality of their dining. Both the breakfast, and dinner are authentic high quality Moroccan. The dining room ambience is accented by a roaring fire place, live music, and coffee in the adjacent gardens. It is the only hotel during our extensive travels, where we had our bellman eagerly volunteer to assist us in our departing room check (under the bed as well) to assure that nothing is left behind",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,"Atmosphere, style and service","This is a lovely hotel in an excellent position : you step through the archway into the medina and there on the right in a high unassuming wall are the blue doors that lead into a luxury riyadh- style hotel with dark carved woods, a sunny plant-filled courtyard where the fountain gurgles, and rooms on three levels. On the fourth floor open terrace is a cool blue pool, comfortable sun-lounging furniture , a little restaurant, and stunning views across the medina and to the sea. We were welcomed with a little tray of delicious fresh orange juice, little cakes and dates, and later a guided tour of the hotel with some of its interesting history..

 November 2017,5,Luxury by Moroccos Seaside,An enjoyable place to stay while visiting Essaouria Medina. The rooms were not overly large but delightful and traditional with all the amenities needed. the restaurant is also recommended. The night lighting is strange as they light each floor in different coloured LEDs making it look more like a theme park rather than the grand old hotel it is. Apart from that its a great place to stay.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,Gorgeous hotel in the Medina,"A gorgeous grand hotel situated in the Essaouira Medina. A short walk to the seaside and port area.

 March 2018,3,Not up to relais chateau standards,"We stayed here 2 nights. We had a large room that was broken up into nooks and crannies so as to make it feel cramped. Lighting was terrible. Several tiles were lifting up so that when you walked on them they wobbled, sometimes so much so that you tripped on them. Seating was uncomfortable. A knob for one of the shutters was broken off. Service was largely indifferent, especially in the lounge and at breakfast but very good at the front desk and in the dining room.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2018,3,This is not a real relais chateaux,"I think it might be one of the best hotel there,but definitively not a relais chateaux . The hotel is beautiful , colonial design will high ceilings, and a garden in the middle . The rooms need renovation, they are dark and smell. Not very comfortable beds and very very noisy . The body milk bottle have been refilled os many times that the cap had lost it colors, i didn’t even touched it. The towels not soft and weak breakfast , We had dinner there and was very disappointing by the chef. Just think of it as an average 4star hotel. But the staff were extremely nice and friendly .",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2018,5,Lovely stay in L’Heure Bleue,"Had a lovely 3 nite break in Essasouria. L’Heure Bleue is a traditional Riad style but with Luxury service. We stayed on the 3rd floor premium suite rooms, and loved all the wood furniture & the space. Bed massive, bathroom huge with a bath you can really soak in. I’m 6’ 3..... Rain shower also good. Room a little dark but you can open shutters into the central courtyard Hamman treatment and massage we thoroughly enjoyed. We were fortunate with weather so the rooftop terrace was divine and excellent for lunch too if going back to airport in afternoon. Cool Casablanca beer! Ice cold in Alex moment! Lovely breakfast arrangement but the orange juice provided is carton and poor compared to rest of offering. Clever use of shot glasses with fruit, I’ll try that idea…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2018,5,Very nice Riad and very helpful staff,"Great location and great restored Riad - we also had the Hammam/massage treatment as a couple which was terrific. Such nice ladies in that area. We had an issue with water pressure on our first night and Mohamed and Kamal looked after us with a room move that was sensational. You will see in many of the management responses that they want you to raise any issues at the time, not afterwards so they can rectify the problem for you. They genuinely want you to enjoy your stay in their wonderful Riad and beautiful city. We spent 3 nights here and is currently our favourite town.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 March 2018,3,This hotel needs sunshine - it rained for our two day stay!,"We were unfortunate to have pretty horrid weather for our two day stay in Essaouira and inevitably that colours one's view of the place. With the sun streaming into the central courtyard, the roof terrace buzzing with guests enjoying the pool and sunshine, and the louvre doors to the bedrooms thrown open to catch a breeze, this might be a wonderful place. But the terrace was closed to all but the most foolhardy because of the weather - it looked like an English resort on a wet winter's day. The hotel is hard to find so make sure you get directions. The nearest transport can get to the place is 50 metres or so; you have to walk the rest - not much fun in a torrential downpour. Our room on the first floor was small and dark and frankly not what I would expect from a five star…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2018,5,Short but sweet stay,A beautiful hotel in an ideal location just inside the medina. All the staff were very welcoming and helpful. We appreciated all the hard work that went into running the hotel by the staff. The suite we stayed in was spacious airy and extremely comfortable. At last a room with a kettle and espresso machine which was an oasis. The 1st hotel in our trip to provide this. The hotel restaurant was superb and we were made to feel at ease. The food was simply amazing. Unfortunately due to the weather we didn't use the roof terrace but we did get up to the terrace and the views are amazing. The breakfast selection was beyond our imagination and although buffet style we did not feel like you needed a fresh cooked option.

The majority of the patronage being french.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2018,4,Good Quality and Location,We stayed here for three nights in January and enjoyed the place very much. I still can't pronounce Essaouira let alone spell it but it is a pleasant location with a nice beach and all the usual markets that there are in Morocco. The hotel is at one of the gates into the old town so is handy both for that and strolling along the beach front which has been nicely modernised. The classic rooms in the hotel are ok but not spacious but the deluxe and the suites are very nice indeed.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2018,4,Escape to Essaouira,"This Riad is really well located. Easy to find and close to where you can park. It has everything for the traveller who wants luxury comfort. Lovely room. The pool on the roof is perfect with great views. Breakfast offers a great selection. It’s not a traditional Riad with that home feel it’s more like a hotel. It’s bigger and more professional. Laundry service was available and a resident hamman.

As we ate breakfast I suddenly got a flash back to the similarly planted open terrace in the Petit Palais! A pleasant setting for a morning meal. When we arrived, we were ushered to a seating area where we were offered heated towels to refresh ourselves. We were then offered fresh squeezed orange juice, cookies, dates, and water. Our room which we were told was an upgrade, was a bit weathered. Tiles on the floor were loose in a number of places. The bathtub is strangely positioned, with high sides, and a potentially difficult path to get in. The hotel has a spectacular roof deck which must be totally divine in warm weather. It has a very appealing heated pool as well. We had an excellent dinner in their dining room serenaded…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

Advice on were to go in the Medina was very much appreciated. A bit of old world charm with modern day quality service.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2018,4,Nice hotel - spa is the only downside - difficult to find availability,"This is a very nice hotel. Good rooms, nice facilities and excellent food. Personnel are really sweet and make you feel at home. They are always attentive and ready to help. Location is perfect. The minus of this hotel is the spa. It is always full and it is a nightmare to book a time. They have just 2 people for almost 40 rooms. The majority of guests are interested in spa treatments when on vacation in Marroco. We are there for 2 nights and were not able to book a time.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2017,5,Best place to stay,"We just returned from an amazing stay at L'Heure Blue in Essaouira. It was beyond our expectations. The service, the food (you MUST eat dinner at the restaurant), the comfort of our room, everything exceeded expectations.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2017,4,Great start to our honeymoon!,A great 4 night start to our honeymoon! A fantastic location at the edge of the medina and impeccable and friendly service from the staff. Roof top terrace was great with wonderful views over the beach and to sea.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2017,5,Luxuary in The Medina,An absolute oasis of colonial luxuary at one of the main gates in to The Medina. Call in for drinks even if you do not stay. Lovely little nibbles with your order. Visit it for the day and use the roof top pool. Lunch is included for around £30 ... amazing 4 courses and the service is excellent. Lounge area look so cozy and decadent. Standard rooms looked small but beautifully fitted out in keeping with the style of the hotel.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2017,3,Nice rooftop and lovely staff,"This hotel could be a great one with a few changes. The staff were the most helpful and gracious that we encountered in any hotel in Morocco. The rooftop is bright and attractive with gorgeous views. The colonial look of the building is quite handsome. The food we tried at the hotel was very good. The downsides: Beds desperately need an upgrade. Most uncomfortable. The rooms have a not so nice odor, like an old musty smell. Soundproofing in rooms not the best. We stayed in a suite room for two nights.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2017,1,Nothing positive...only negatives,"It's better sometimes not to describe but as a warning there is no positive at all in this hotel. The rooms with high humidity in November ... Noisy rooms , The worst wi-fi ever of all the hotels I have visited . Average breakfast Extreme noise in the toilet !!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2017,4,RoofTop!,"Colonial style hotel in a perfect location. Choose a higher category of the room, because smaller rooms are not very convenient and are really tiny. Enjoyed the evenings at the rooftop terrace, very interesting to watch from there how the life is so different on that side of the world.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Wonderful boutique hotel,"We loved our stay in this hotel. The location was great right in the Medina. The food was great, breakfast in the beautiful courtyard. The roof top was a very nice area and we enjoyed a delicious lunch there. A very enjoyable stay; highly recommended.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2017,5,Luxury hotel on the edge of the medina,We were upgraded to a suite on the 2nd floor and it was really gorgeous. The large sitting area was extremely comfortable and we also had external windows (somewhat rare in a riad). Breakfast was in the pretty ground floor garden terrace and there was also a nice rooftop area with lounge seating where we had lunch. Dinner was good but a bit too formal for our tastes.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Midnight at the Oasis !,Located in the medina this hotel is a little slice of luxury in a somewhat hectic area. Beautiful breakfast served in the garden courtyard. Room clean & comfortable & quite. Staff very helpful. We didn't eat in the restaurant although it looked extremely romantic & I'd love to go back & give it a try.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2017,4,Three days recovery,As we are in our sixth week trip around Morocco it was great to stay here for three nights. Walk outside to the Medina Suite comfortable and clean Great courtyard in the middle and pool on the roof. Windy place and cool at this time of the year Staff friendly and accommodating Ahmed a divine Chef so we stayed here for dinner each night He is a great chef and the restaurant staff a delight,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2017,4,A family home transformed into a boutique hotel,"Like most traditional Moroccan hotels, the Heure Bleue Palais is fashioned around a Riad's courtyard. The lush green garden sets a pretty scene for afternoon tea or breakfast. According to the hotel, the interior design features four styles; our suite was oriental.The hotel has the feel of an old colonial home, and indeed the Palais was once just that. Today the four floors feature comfortable accommodation and a rooftop pool and bar. Service was very friendly, particularly in reception, but it wasn't always prompt in the bar or at breakfast. Our room was spacious albeit the attention to detail was under par. We had a missing shower head support, non-functional tap-ware in the bath and problems with the TV remote. Not to worry, the maintenance staff were quick to respond…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2017,5,"Luxury setting, perfect service","We stayed at Heure Bleue Palais for 1 week and couldn't have been happier with it. If taking a taxi from the airport you are dropped a short distance from the hotel which you are greeted by grand blue doors on your right, from the first moment you step through the doors you will feel at home. We stayed in a suite which was spacious, clean and well kept but with a rustic feel to it. The large bath was a nice bonus as normally due to height we struggle to fit in. The bed was easily big enough for us, although slightly hard for my partners taste. Breakfast buffet is well stocked and you can easily add variety so you don't get bored of the same food. Service was friendly and prompt. Housekeeping each day were thorough and restocked anything needed in the room. Water, tea,…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2017,4,An oasis of calm,"Our second visit to this hotel as it's an ideal base for exploring the medina which we love. It would be so easy to walk past the hotel without even realising it existed, but stepping out of the bright, hot, noisy, bustling medina alley, through the riad's huge doors and into the cool calm of the dark wood hall is just bliss. There are tall palms and a gentle fountain in the central courtyard which add to the air of tranquility. The rooms are lovely, but a lot of the hotel could do with some general TLC - peeling paint on the landing, one of our plug sockets didn't work, one of our shutters was hanging on with only one hinge, one lift (of the two) was out of action all week etc. etc. Breakfast was great with loads of choice. The staff are lovely and very helpful. The…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,Elegant and peaceful oasis in Essouaira,"Luxurious hotel just inside the medina walls. The decor is beautiful and tasteful with colonial features. The staff were incredibly attentive, with a great breakfast buffet! The rooftop pool and seating area was a highlight, watching the city from above in this tranquil setting. One criticism - the restaurant is very expensive for dinner, restaurants in the town were much better and cheaper.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2017,4,Great roof top area and pool,"A very nice Riad in a great position. Staff excellent and very efficient except one girl at breakfast, I am sure she was a very good worker but very unfriendly. I think she thought we were American but we are not. We did find that if you not French in Essaouria the boutiques didn't really want to know you. Guess what English is the world language. Thanks to all the staff that helped us as our bags were missing for the 3 nights we stayed. The roof top is beautiful and well kept as is the pool. Our room was very comfortable and kept very clean. Bed could be a bit more comfortable but that is personal taste. Food was very good.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,Elegant dinner at L'heure Blue Essouaira,"We stayed at the sister riad in fes (riad fes) and went to this property for dinner during our stay in essouaira. Dinner was absolutely delicious and the hotel property creates for elegant ambiance. The only reason we did not consider this property was because we wanted a beach front property. In hindsight knowing the location (less than five minute walk) I would stay here next time. The service impeccable and the food is simply amazing. Highly recommend the prawn risotto:) and the chocolate mousse (egg free, dairy free and sugar free!). I will take their word for it. The front desk manager was very friendly and provided us with a reliable source to get the oh so famous Argan oil. I wanted to make sure I got the real deal (100% pure) and he recommended a source that I will be…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,Luxury hospitality,"I stayed a week in this beautiful old palace in the Medina. My first impression was how beautiful is the place and when you go in is like to be in a oasis of relax in the middle of the outside chaos. The service I have experienced here is the best I had in my life, professional, honest and very friendly .The treat you as you were a familiar .Food is excellent, starting from breakfast, grill in the swimming pool and finishing with the restaurant. I found the restaurant team extremely well organize and top hospitality. My very big problem was that I didn't want to leave the place any moment, I loved to stay the whole day in . Thank you very much to all the staff !",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2017,4,Excellent choice for staying in Essaouira,"L’Heure Bleue, once we’d found it, is in an ideal location just inside ‘Bab Marrakech’, one of the gates in to the Medina. There is no charge for parking which is a few metres away, just outside the gate. The pool & terrace are much larger than they look in photos. The lovely long beach is nearby & great for a walk & a paddle but the pool is much nicer (& less windy) to relax by. Rooms are quiet & we much appreciated being upgraded from our booked Deluxe Room to a Suite. Kamal on the front desk was exceptionally friendly & helpful. Tip: Take a sweater (my husband forgot!) / cardy – even on warm days the wind whistles down into the breakfast courtyard",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2017,5,5 stars in the middle of the medina,"Great location: within the medina, but still easy to find. Breakfast was excellent. The interior courtyard is amazing, day and night. Nice rooftop pool deck with great views and a chilly pool. Classy bar, drinks were fairly expensive. Staff were super friendly, maybe a little less attentive than some westerners are used to; more of an attitude of letting the guests have their privacy. Would definitely stay here again.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2017,4,Blue Gem of a Hotel,"The pathway leading to this blue gem was strewn with litter and beggars and I was coming off the heels of a very rollercoaster long drive. So I was skeptical. But once inside the doors, we were greeted with a beautiful courtyard, and respite from a long trip. The beds were quite small; service very friendly and bend over backwards helpful. A little annoyed to hear the billiards in the wee hours of the morning but it was temporary. Our driver to and from Essouira and tour guide were reliable and delightful and helped us navigate the best of this ancient town. And best part is we were a stone's throw to the bustling medina and beach.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,"Amazing stay in Essaouria! Exceptional service, great roof terrace and gorgeous internal courtyard.","Exceptional service! Everyone was not only incredibly caring and helpful, but went the extra mile every day in every small gesture to pamper us and make sure we had the best possible experience. Amazing roof terrace and internal courtyard. The roof terrace is even nicer and bigger than it appears in the photos, and it was the best spot to relax and enjoy the sunshine in great comfort. The courtyard is an incredible oasis of peace from the noise and chaos of the medina, gorgeous and soothing.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2017,4,Good hotel option for Essouira,"This is probably one of the nicer hotels in Essouira but didn't compare to our other hotels during the trip (Palais Faraj in Fes and La Maison Arabe in Marrakech) despite a generally similar price. The location is good, just inside the Medina walls and a short walk through the Medina to the wharf and beach. The staff was great, and able to help us with whatever we needed. However, our room was small and all the rooms face the courtyard, which can be noisy at times. The hotel does have a pool but Essouira is very windy (famous for kiteboarding and windsurfing) so it was too cold to really use the pool when we were there. The do include a breakfast buffet and it was good. The hotel does have a cinema room where you can watch one of their DVDs. It also has a pool and…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2017,3,Beautiful property if you get a decent room,"As the positive reviews note, the location of the hotel as well as the architecture are terrific. Drawbacks are that (1) we didn't have a real window in our room. This made the room smell damp from the shower and (2) AC didn't work which means we were hot at night although it was cool outside. (3) Internet is so slow in most rooms that its barely usable. Included breakfast and service were fine overall except attention to detail when cleaning bathrooms. For the amount of money you're paying to stay at this hotel, all the above shouldn't be issues. Since most places in town charge a fraction of this price, probably better to pick elsewhere unless you feel strongly that you want to use the pool or enjoy the architecture.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,Lovely old style riyadh hotel,"Loved it - old style riyadh. Great staff and ensure that you book a suite which is not much more than the other standard / deluxe rooms below the suite standard. The suites have both shower and bath and that bit more space. If you can book a room, avoid the taxi rank side - not horrendous at all but attracts a little more noise but that drops to nothing later on. Evening meals aimed at gourmands - so we gave that a miss and went to Caravanne Cafe 5 mins away which was fab - see review. Breakfast very good. We were gutted to leave - loved the place and the town which felt very safe indeed. The hotel is in the town - so literally you walk out and there it is !",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,A great find.,"The hotel is right by one of the entrances to the medina. The building is beautiful. Balconies run around the nicely planted and shaded central courtyard. Our room, 28 is huge, with an entrance foyer, seating area and large bedroom with a large bath and shower room. Tea and coffee making facilities and a refrigerator with water are provided and renewed each day. the bed is very comfortable with great linen. The dining is fantastic!. Breakfast is excellent with Moroccan dishes, cold meat and cheese, fresh fruits, cakes, pickled lemons, nut, dried fruits etc. Egg dishes can be ordered. Dinner is on another level. It is the best we've had in Morocco It is not cheap but well presented and served in the courtyard or separate dining room. There is a small cinema and a billiard room.…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2017,2,Disappointing,"L'Heure Bleue Palais did not live up to our expectations. While the ambience is nice, the interior of the rooms is of rather low quality: The beds are quite uncomfortable and the plumbing is poor. What surprised us most is the low quality of the breakfast.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,The Best,"If your budget allows it, stay here. If not, at least try to dine here. The service is fabulous. The atmosphere is sublime. The food is delicious and creative. The wine list is varied and affordable. Highly recommended!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2017,5,"excellent location, lovely courtyard, fabulous breakfast","This is a historic building that has been carefully and tastefully renovated to preserve the ambiance but upgrade comfort. The hotel has an excellent location. Our family (two adult daughters) had two rooms, side by side, which were nice but not exceptional but very nice They were dark with the main windows facing the courtyard, as is characteristic of many older riads. Everything worked well and was very comfortable. The breakfast is outstanding with wide variety of very fresh food--the best we had in all of Morocco. The public areas of the hotel, the courtyard and roof top, are lovely. We enjoyed a nice drink in the courtyard with a musician in the evening after dinner . Excellent service.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2017,2,Not worth it,"I loved the room, loved the beauty of the riad, perfect location, great breakfast, friendly staff except one at breakfast BUT you can have the best hotel with the best view from the rooftop that does NOT make up for me having to have cold showers and a very lukewarm tub part throughout my stay- that is a non - negotiable and a basic requirement- HOT water- the excuse given by 2 staff- that we are showering when all the other guests are showering- REALLY, this is a hotel and most guests shower before breakfast! Yet the hotel was not full to capacity and we didn't have hot water at midnight, at 8:30 am at 10 am on another day and even 12 pm it was still only warm- extremely dissapointing as this was the most expensive of all the hotels that we stayed in from fes to casablanca to…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

Check in was warm and welcoming. Mamadou with his big smile is so helpful and friendly,and specially front managers Naima and Mohamed, and all the others did everything to help and to please us. Big compliments! The first 2 nights we stayed in a deluxe corner room on the 3 th floor. This is just under the roof terrace, so sometimes specially during lunchtime, it was quiet noisy. After 2 days we moved into a deluxe suite on the second floor, and that was a real gem. beautiful decorated, including a wonderful fireplace, amazing bathroom, little salon, work desk etc. Absolutely wonderful. For me personal, the rooftop restaurant and swimming pool area , are…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2017,4,"Wonderful Service, Amazing Rooftop Terrace/Pool","We give this hotel our highest recommendation for service - what a lovely and fantastic staff, especially Kamal and so many others who made us feel very welcome from the minute we checked in throughout our stay. And this must be the most fabulous rooftop terrace and pool area in all of Essaouria. We spent one whole day there lounging on the very comfy chairs/beds and having a delish lunch - the club sandwiches and Essaouira grilled sardines, yum! Loved the main dining/courtyard area and also being able to use the balcony & cool, old-school chairs in front of our rooms. We had a gorgeous dinner one evening and loved the breakfast selection. Our family of two adults & two teenagers definitely enjoyed our time here but we got a vaguely cold vibe, or just something a little off,…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,Beautiful!,This hotel was small and very well done! It's at the entrance of the medina which was a little chaotic at first. The giant trees in the foyer were a nice touch. The room had a fireplace and the rooftop was really amazing! We loved it here.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,Fabulous Riad Experience,"Adjacent to the ancient medina of Essaouria the Heure Bleue is a restored building in the style of a Riad - 4 floors built around a central courtyard enclosing a beautiful garden. All of the rooms open to the attractive and bright courtyard. The rooms are well furnished in a style evoking Morroco in the '30s. The location is within easy walking distance of all of the attractions with a souk just beyond the front entrance to the hotel. Pool, bar, restaurant are all well done and the staff is most hospitable. This is the perfect place to stay when visiting Essaouria. One caution. We were independent travelers and relied on the hotel to arrange a half day walking tour of the Medina and a car with English speaking driver/guide to visit an Argan oil cooperative and surrounding…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,Our second visit - won't be our last!,"This is the best hotel in Essaouira and one of the nicest I've stayed in anywhere! The rooms are pure 1930s style Moroccan luxury - think if Agatha Christie had set a murder mystery in Morocco! A cross between a Sultan's dream and a gentlemen's club. The rooftop sun deck is a great place to swim, read relax and catch the breeze and have a lovely lunch. The location is perfect. Breakfast is delicious (especially the Berber pancakes made fresh in the dining room). The restaurant is also excellent for dinner.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2016,4,It's like being in a classic black and white,"This is probably one of the most atmospherically charming old world romantic hotels that I've stayed in. It's has a real Casablanca ""play it again Sam"" kinda feel. The dark wood panelling of the restaurants and bar with animal skins and with the scent of old leather and cigars is intoxicating. The room is just as charming with a central fire place which can be lit by request and it has bay windows with shutters where you can look in to the central atrium and peep on opposing suites while you read. The roof top bar and pool is also a bonus, really chilled with great views, a real sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the streets. My only criticism is the variety of food, breakfast was a little limited mainly breads and all a little dry. Evenings were okay but once again a…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2017,1,Hospitality until 21.30,"I have been visiting this hotel various times as I own a house in Essaouira and was never impressed by their hospitality. Tonight we went for cocktails; we were 3 and paid 50 euro's, returning at 21.40 for dinner and being told the kitchen is closed. After saying we didn't understand and walking to the reception, the manager and receptionist didn't even bother to get up and said 'we're using fresh products and there is nothing left' It was quite obvious there was no willingness and not necessary an empty kitcken. Bizar for a Relais & Chateaux; obviously their rates doesn't reflect their staff motivation",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2017,5,The most beautiful hotel in Essaouira,"This hotel really made my whole trip to Essaouira special, it was absolutely one of my favorite parts about this city! You escape the hustle and bustle of the Medina into this beautiful, tranquil, and calm courtyard full of palm trees when you walk in the door. The rooftop pool deck is great not just for the pool, but I also had one of my favorite meals of the trip here, a really lovely lunch spot. The location is perfect as you don't have to venture far into the winding alleys of the Medina to get here, it is just right inside the gates so it is super accessible and easy to get to. I definitely recommend staying here if you are heading to Essaouira!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,Lovely Hotel made even better by the staff,Based on the edge of the medina this hotel is very much at the top on customer service.Nothing is too much trouble and they are very proactive.

 March 2017,4,Very nice stay in a seaside hotel,"We spent one night here. The rooms were not as luxurious as other places we had stayed in Morocco, but fine. The courtyard is pretty. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. It had more variety of fresh fruits and breads/pastries than any other place we stayed. Rooftop pool and deck are also quite nice.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2017,5,Fabulous small hotel in old town,"Loved this hotel where the staff are the best thing about it, warm and friendly people for whom nothing seems too much trouble. They went out of their way to take care of us. We had a suite on the top floor (of 3) which had tiny windows opening onto the square outside the old town, and big windows with shutters opening onto the central courtyard. Being on the outside wall of the town the hotel is quiet, but has easy access to both the beach and the medina, so it's easy to find restaurants for a change of scene. The only drawback is the Wi-Fi, which can be quite slow at times, but that is not specific to the hotel - the internet cafés were the same speed. Altogether would highly recommend the hotel.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2017,5,Great place,Excellent and elegant riad in the Medina close to Bab Marrakech gate . Had a very nice premium suite and much appreciated the professional and friendly staff.

The rooms were spacious & the decor was fab. Each day the room was made up, fresh fruit (dates & oranges) & water were left & each evening our beds were turned down. The roof top terrace with pool was a great addition with towels and sun hats provided, you even get a complimentary smoothie shot which are yum-perfect chill out area in right inside the bustle of the medina!

With just a simple blue door in a high white wall and no name sign it hides conveniently just inside the Medina. It is a total contrast inside to what you experience outside. You have the calm, splendor inside and a bustling Medina outside on your doorstep. Without doubt it is the best hotel in Essouira. It is on the site of an old warehouse that was turned into an orphanage then left abandoned for 30 years in 1960 until a local family bought it and turned it into a luxury hotel. It opened in 2004 and is a hidden gem. Despite being quite expensive it is good value for money if you want a hotel of this quality and style in this…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

Very slow breakfast service in cold patio...",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2016,5,Spectacular hotel,"We really liked this place. Very welcoming upon arrival, and we ate breakfast here each morning. The room was beautiful and I could not get over how amazing the hotel interior was. It's the perfect location too. The restaurant seemed a bit expensive, even by the standard of some of the high end dining in Marrakech, so we did not eat anything but breakfast here. Very helpful staff. Would definitely recommend it. One drawback was the shower. You have to hold it in your hand (it's a 'telephone' shower). Would be much better if mounted to the wall.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2016,4,Nice hotel in the old medina,"This hotel feels like an enclave. Behind the white walls and big doors from the busy medina street its all hushed calm, pot plants and lots of tiling. Its just inside the gates from the south side of the medina. All of the rooms appear to be opening onto an internal courtyard with a pool, bar terrace on the roof. Great views and breezes up there but it was all closed up for the winter. Our room was quiet, clean and comfortable and was decorated in a kind of African style. Le Sens de Marrakesh toiletries are in the bathroom, one of my favourites and oh so luscious! These can be brought from the display case at reception if you need to stock up. There was spicy incense burning in the room when we arrived which also added to the ambience. Fruit and biscuits are also on offer.…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2016,4,Very good hotel in excellent location,"The building itself is beautiful, with a large inner courtyard and nice rooftop pool and bar. Very beatify sitting room where pre-dinner drinks are served. Well-decorated rooms in ""african"" style, with lots of dark wood, tiled floor. We had a standard room (the smallest category) which I thought was on the smaller side, even comparing it to other riads we stayed in. Same was true for the bed (American King size). That said we spent most of the time outside, and the location is perfect: right at the entrance of the medina, yet at the same time only a 5min walk to the beach. Staff was friendly and accommodating, but not quite 5*: e.g. service at the restaurant tended to be at the slower side. Quality and quantity of the breakfast buffet was very nice. Value/price I'd give it a top…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2016,4,Not quite 5*,"The building was stunning and we were welcommed with fresh juice and biscuits. We were given a tour of the facilities before going to our room which was ready even though we arrived at midday. Majority of staff were very polite and friendly. However, what has stopped me giving it 5* was the breakfast service. 1st morning we arrived at 10am and lots of items had not ben refreshed (breakfast finished at 10.30), had to askfor juice aand butter and no one really noticed us. 2nd day we were earlier thinking it would be better but it was much worse. Had to ask numerous times for juice, gave up and collected it myself when i saw it on the side. Multiple requests for butter, in which time toast was cold and when i asked for the 4th time, the waiter was borderline rude letting me…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2016,4,"An oasis in a lovely city, but it is not prefect.","When I arrived at this hotel I felt like many other commentators. My room seemed tired and in need of a refresh. But after a day or so I began to appreciate what it is and what it is not. The staff is wonderful, the interior courtyard is beautiful, the cuisine (breakfast and the Moroccan dinners) are wonderful. The views from the rooms are not great. But if you can get a room with a terrace that looks outside the medina it is OK (if a bit no noisy until 10:30 pm). Essaouira is a lovely coastal Moroccan city and the hotel is perfectly located. The medina is full of vibrant souks and real Moroccan people. The views of the harbor are amazing. So I suggest you go into the experience with an open mind and you will be pleased. There is a wonderful community of local artists…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 November 2016,5,Magical place,"This is a very unique place in the world. We stayed for two nights and felt sad when we left. What is great: The location - an old palace at the outside of the medina just behind the wall and a city gatl. You can actually drive to it, they have a private parking outside the gate. The service: warm and friendly staff, they really care for you and you can truly ask for anything. The rooms: great decor, facing an inside courtyard with a fountain and the restaurant. The rooftop: pool overlooking the old city, with lounge chairs and a small second lunch restaurant/BBQ The atmosphere: this is how 1001 nights feels like, little treats like fruits, cookies make it very personal What could be better: Pool: just a little bit too cold and time to buy new towels and pillows Hammam: visit…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2016,3,Lovely riad but seen better days ...,"Honestly, is such a sleepy seaside town heure-bleue is a lovely escape, which lights up at night. Lovely rooftop pool, but it just lacks a bit of life. We felt like we are the only people in the place which meant no-one was serving on the roof. The room, which was sizeable smelt musty, like it hadnt been used for months, and the carpets and bedspreads were so dusty they could use a spectacular beating. The wi-fi was a disaster zone and dropped every minute ... 0.8mb/s so not enough to even send pics on whatsapp. Shame really as Its a relais et chateaux. Like essaouria i would say it has seen better days. Strikes me as a town on the decline. Quite a bit of game of thrones filmed here ... but the battlements are closed for rennovations for a year, no doubt before season 7 and…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2016,3,Great hotel- if you have a room with a window,"The hotel has a beautiful inside garden. The bar is very impressive and the breakfast was very good. The staff was nice and inviting. But- the room that we stayed in had no windows and although the staff lid a scented candle - it had a moldy smell of a room without a window. To be correct - there was a small window that turned to the inside patio, but to use it meant zero privacy. When we ordered the room on a internet ,n they did not mentioned the fact that there are no windows. In our opinion the price of the room did not reflect the standard of it.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

The staff are very helpful and friendly. The central garden area is delightful and the setting for the buffet breakfast which is excellent. The terrace includes a pool, a bar and restaurant for lunch, and ocean views. With two lifts as well as stairs, it's easy to move around the hotel. Highly recommend.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2016,4,Well placed Hotel,"This is a very well placed Hotel just inside the Medina, so easy to walk to the Port and souk from. Lovely setting with a central courtyard, we had one of the few rooms that looked out away from the Medina so it was much lighter than the rest of the rooms which look into the courtyard and are rather dark. Lovely roof top pool and lunch bar. The hotel is rather ""Tired"" housekeeping was hit and miss the bath was a disgrace very very chipped with a horrid plastic mat to hide them, and the air con did not really work. No one was very bothered they tried to fix it but there was no sense of urgency or real interest. Essaouira is delightful really lovely well worth a visit",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 September 2016,5,Lovely surroundings in a perfect Medina location,"This hotel, part of the Relais and Chateaux affiliation, is exquisitely renovated. All the rooms open into the lush greenery of an open atrium. In addition, the staff is very helpful. We had the least expensive room, and it was simple and perfectly designed with a comfortable bed and a large and functional bathroom. The only snag for us is that we had some urgent internet business and the connection was so weak and slow we became fearful that we would not be able to complete our business. Also, with all the pledged to service of the staff, there is not the level of warmth that I experienced at Les Jardins de le Medina in Marrakech, where I felt drawn to friends very quickly, and this hotel, perhaps just for our California taste, is too formal. This is exemplified in the…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

The roof pool works beautifully, with immaculate service, and lovely snacks and drinks. The bedrooms open on to a spacious atrium, with a cloistered corridor on each floor, and a small fountain at the base - it provides a brilliant location for breakfast and dinner.

The breakfast was great, the pool are was great, the staff were the most welcoming people and they couldn't go further out of their way to help you. The culture between the staff is great and it is a huge contributing factor to what made the stay so great. Location is good and really easy to find, you don't have to wind down any alleys to get in.

 August 2016,4,Great location and excellent service,"My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights during a visit to Essaouira. The location was perfect- just inside the Bab Marrakech gate in the medina making it easy to find and easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The porters, front desk and wait staff were all excellent. We had breakfast twice, dinner once, and drinks twice in the lovely palm-filled courtyard - a perfect respite from the crowded medina. We were upgraded to a larger room which was nice. The rooftop pool was OK but the windiness made it uncomfortable to stay up there too long. My only real issue was the musty smell in the room. Our clothes smelled of damp wood even upon return home to NY. Other than that, it was perfect.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,Far from the madding crowd,"We have visited Essaouria before but now that our offspring are older and want their freedom we opted to stay in the Medina. Our first time at Heure Bleue and it didn't disappoint. From the moment you walk through the front door you are made to feel very welcome. Moroccan hospitality at it's very best. Traditional design, with a central open courtyard providing welcoming shade during the heat of the day. Piano bar, games room and even a cinema where you are able to watch your own dvd's. There's a roof top swimming pool, not heated, and it certainly took your breath away as you slipped in.

The location is perfect, inside the walls of the old city and just a short walk to the beach, the harbour and the main square. But what makes this hotel special is the staff from the sweet old guy that monitors the car parking to the team on the terrace. The door guys that greet you in and out of the hotel, the reception and breakfast team, the barman that remembers what you like to drink, everyone come across as really wanting you to have the best stay, sincere warm and caring.

The chef Ahmed Handour deserves a Michelin star...or rather not if we want to keep the restaurant a well-kept secret among guests. He proposes excellent, creative versions of traditional Moroccan gastronomy, with a twist of audacity. The second night, I left it to the chef to create something new...and there came the best meal I had in ages (NY and Paris included). The only thing L'Heure Bleue could improve is the service at the spa, which was rigid and quite cold in comparison to the rest of the staff, whether in the patio, bar, restaurant, rooftop pool or reception.

Stepping through the big, blue doors from the busy, bustling street was magical and once inside, the hotel is an old-school, palm filled, calm haven. The staff are all fantastic; so warm and keen to make sure that everything is just as you'd wish it to be. Little touches, like remembering your cocktail of choice or how you like your tea, make all the difference. Our standard room was absolutely fine; not too small and we were OK with a shower instead of a bath (they are in the deluxe rooms!).

Breakfast was delicious, roof terrace was fab (albeit a bit windy) and the lunch BBQ exceeded expectations - so tasty and well worth the money. Didn't have the dinner as it seemed quite pricey, but I'm sure it was great too! Staff were fab and friendly! Room was amazing and old world classic chic. Literally the only fault I could find was that the DVD remote didn't work! Hardly a deal breaker... Go and stay here, you won't regret it!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

The air conditioner in our room wasn't working properly and after a day we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working. The rooms were lovely but few minor maintenance issues need addressing in both rooms. The bbq lunch on the roof top was lovely and would recommend this.

The property has been updated with all modern conveniences. I had a suite complete with fireplace.

If I had any criticism it would be that the lovely Bar Anglais should have a fire lit, and either an honesty bar or a barman in the vicinity.

The hotel, right inside the Medina, so unless you can't carry your baggage a little way, don't let a stranger with a cart charge you 5 Euros to wheel it over. In fact I believe the hotel will bring your bags if you get dropped off at their shuttle bus stop. The service was exquisite from the moment we arrived. The upgrade to a suite was unexpected and appreciated. The room was beautiful and highlighted by a blend of traditional Moroccan and French architecture. Booking the hamam was easy and friendly. The hamam itself was the nicest we visited in Morocco.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2015,5,Beautiful in every way,"Stayed here again mid December and loved it. Staff are all fantastic and our suite was divine so big and comfortable. Breakfasts are amazing with a beautiful buffet and cooked eggs etc. The hotel is in the medina but as soon as you walk through the door you feel that you are in a quiet and peaceful oasis. Our room was really quiet and very spacious with a massive bed and lots of comforts provided. Bathrobes, shampoo, body lotion from the spa etc. The weather was fab so we used the roof top pool each day and the serivce is great so you can have drinks and food up there if you wish. The staff really make this place special. The location is great for the beach and the medina. They ordered us a cab for the airport and it was cheaper than some old one we got from the airport as had…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2016,4,So helpful,"Everyone here is charming making out stay so comfortable, old world character and the roof top terrace is great for a few hours relaxation after a morning exploring the beach, medina and port. Breakfast in the courtyard was delightful, it's cool in January so don't forget a wrap.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2016,5,The pocket Hammam is a jewel,"We have never stayed the night, but have spent some hours there on different occasions, particularly enjoying the ""pocket Hammam"", which is a must, to be enjoyed ideally in pairs but fitting for a group of four. It is a compact succession of three spaces, a miniature temple of sensuality. The hot steam room is octagonal, with small toplit urns on four of the sides, just wide enough for you to sit in and not burn your elbows with the hot black stone that clads the whole space from the dome to the floor. The black marble floor does have a thin white venature to help you read the perimeter in the otherwise totally black, misty space. The temperate scrub room is also all black, with two black marble tables for you to lye on and be skinned alive by the masseuses. If you don't know…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2016,5,Excellent,"I travel all the time and make myself at home everywhere but there are three hotels that have stolen my heart and this is one of them. The others are the Merrion in Dublin and the Regent in Zagreb. From the moment the Senegalise doorman lets you in to the ""see you again"" of the reception through the staff who attend to your every need this place is a treat.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2015,2,Magnificant rooms and awaful people at the front desk.,"This riad is magnificent but the people at the riad don't reflect the magnificence. I was shocked at how rude and unhelpful both the front desk attendant and the riad manager were when assistance was asked for. The hotel staff engagement was as if they were doing the guests a favor rather than delighting the guests. Great rooms, food, location and building otherwise.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2015,5,Old world charm meets modern luxury,"This hotel has much to offer including a beautiful design and great location right indie the Marrakech gate: turn left and you are outside the Medina with easy access to beach, turn right and you head right into the very manageable Medina. Ground floor features many common rooms, restaurant, spa and courtyard, all of the upper floors overlook the courtyard with standard rooms on first floor and suites on floors 2 and 3. The pool and lounging areas are on the roof. Pros: nice bathroom with double sinks and separate shower and tub; comfortable bed and pillows; very good food (lunch is served on roof top terrace); great location; very friendly and helpful staff; beautiful décor Cons: little loud; a lot of smokers on property; room was a bit dark",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2015,5,Luxurious,My wife did not know what hotel I had booked. From the moment she arrived to the moment she left her mouth was permanently open in disbelieve. This is an amazing hotel and if there are places that provide a better standard of service then they must exist in heaven! I would say that this style of architecture is more suited for the summer months but even when we sat down for breakfast we were provided with a gas overhead heater. Even if you just visit the restaurant you will not be disappointed. I was treated like family on my 50th birthday. Thank you to all the staff.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,Wonderful hotel that lives up to its Relais and Chateau name,"This is a great hotel that has wonderful charm and beautiful interior design. I would highly recommend this hotel. PROS: -great service as expected by Relais and Chateau. -location. You are at the foot of the medina. BUT you are not an the water. -Rooms are very nicely appointed. -nice rooftop bar area. CONS: -Although the property is nicely appointed, it still needs to go a bit further to truly be a 5 star Relais and Chateau property. My room was nice, but the bathroom was covered with some mildew stains on the wall, the sink dripped incessantly and the shower pressure in my room was not very good. (My colleagues had better pressure, I'm told.) There was a half drank bottle of water in my room when i arrived. Non of these issues are terrible, but if you're going to be…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,incredible good service,this hotel is truly a gem when it comes to service. the people are so friendly and so good in giving you more than you need. you order tea and you get it with nice pastries... the decor is really nice and very reminiscent of the twenties-forties. tasteful garden. Only comments would be : they could play some soft classical music to add atmosphere.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,Fantastic,"We have just spent a week at this stunning boutique hotel. The service and attention to detail was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Great location, stunning views & delicious food all make this a perfect place to stay and relax. With the medina on the doorstep and the beach 5 minutes away it has everything you need. We will definitely be going back.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,Relaxed & comfortable,"Welcoming, excellent service with unexpected extras, like pastries/biscuits in the room and free tasty canapés with drinks. Relaxing lounge area around the plants. Cool and quiet. Pool area is relaxing but the pool was too cold! Great location within the medina but away from the hustle and bustle.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,"Stay once, stay twice","A peaceful riad situated at the heart of Essaouira, l'Heure Bleue is a combination of hospitality and savoir-faire, of Moroccan tradition coupled to a western touch, that resulted in a memorable 2-day stay. Spaces are beautifully decorated in a colonial style and rooms extremely comfortable. I loved having breakfast in the patio and particularly appreciated the freshly-squeezed orange juice and Moroccan pancakes. You can chill endlessly by the swimming pool situated on the rooftop that overlooks the old town and ocean. Evenings are very pleasant too and if you decide to have a quiet dinner at the hotel, canapés and tapas are a good choice. Staff is welcoming, caring and helpful which made the stay even more agreeable. Until next time, thank you!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,Pure Perfection,"We just got back......and please do not hesitate even one second to stay here!! Set right inside the bustling medina it is truly an oasis of luxury, sophistication and service. You will be amazed at how gorgeous it is. And what a great value for a Relais and Chateaux property.....amazing! Our room was fantastic and oh so comfortable and the mint tea, cookies and fruit left for us each day! Outstanding breakfast! We did the Couples Hamman and Massage treatment......you wont believe how special it is. This is a hotel to be savored for its beauty and style and the royal service that every guest gets!!!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Great Stay!,"We loved this hotel! It was the best hotel we stayed at in Morocco. Excellent retreat from the hustle and bustle just outside the door. Staff was fantastic, room was very spacious and well appointed. I would highly recommend.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,A great oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Medina,"Whilst we didn't stay at the hotel, we had a recommendation that it was fabulous for lunch on the terrace. We never even made that, but we did stop for aperitifs and canapes in the enclosed patio. The service was impeccable and the surroundings exquisite. The food we had was well presented and extremely tasty. I would definitely give this place some special attention if you want to have that special occasion. It was quite expensive, but definitely worth the outlay!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,Chic hotel with superb staff and great location,We had a wonderful long weekend at L'Heure Bleue staying in one of the scrumptious suites. The hotel courtyard is lovely and the roof pool top very relaxing. We took our bikes as we were exploring the area and they gave us space to build and store them and helped us source spares when we had a minor mishap! Nothing was too much trouble. We had spa treatments which were fantastic and I well recommend their couples signature hamman. They also recommended some wonderful local restaurants to save us the hassle of researching. When we hadn't come home by dark one evening from being out on the bikes - due to said mishap - they called the vinyard they knew we had lunched at to check we were ok and hadn't had a accident - so thoughtful. Breakfast was simply divine and HUGE!,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Impossible to describe .....,"It is almost impossible to describe the beauty of this hotel, its quality of style and hospitality shown by every member of staff. Although we did not stay here we visited on two occasions ... our first visit was to look around the hotel and to gather some literature and this was followed by a drink in the spectacular courtyard. We ordered Royal Breakfast Black Tea and the tchaba teabags have to be seen to be believed - check them out on the tchaba website! Our evening visit was for the Chef's Kemia (Sunday Special) - consisting of various tapas style seafood dishes + a glass of wine, costing approx. 320 Dhs (£22.50). The hotel is based around a courtyard with colonial style furniture and exotic greenery and is a unique setting to enjoy a leasurely drink.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,A fine Boutique Hotel,We stayed a week in this very well appointed hotel. The room was fantastic and the pool area a pleasure to lounge around. The service was impeccable and the staff very attentive and knowledgeable. The breakfast table offered all manners of choices. The pool terrace also had a very good menu. The only slight tarnish to this establishment was the evening meal. It simply does not live up to the very high standard the hotel has set for itself; but then we had been spoiled by fine dining at the O'Bleu Mogador.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2015,4,Beautiful but with niggles...,"Beautiful hotel, lovely quiet spot at the edge of a busy medina. Our room was very well appointed with balcony. Lobby and dining area like something from a bygone era. Service was great, staff friendly. Breakfast was plentiful. I agree with past comment that the pool was cold - definitely too cold for me! I also think some maintenance is required on the roof terrace because some floor tiles are definitely past their best (not something that would normally bother me, but when paying a premium for premium looks, these things start to stand out). I guess this is down to the elements as it is very windy in Essaouira. We asked for a transfer cost from Marrakech and it was double what anyone else quoted me, and whilst I appreciate they are running a business, I found this to be…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,An experience to remember,"We stayed in this hotel from 16th - 19th September 2015 and it is a lovely hotel with outstanding service. the interior courtyard reminded me of a colonial style house and with 33 rooms you have a choice of a suite or a basic room. Our suite was big enough for 3 to sleep in albeit one bed was in the window alcove, however comfortable. The breakfast is taken in the courtyard and the choice is immense, fruit, nuts, pancakes, cereals and pastries but just a few. Tea facilities in each room is unique and fresh fruit every day in the room. The pool on the roof has to be the most beneficial addition during the summer, with great views, mellow music and lunch was fantastic and very reasonable in price. however, for me it is about the people and the staff, from cleaners to the…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2015,4,Great looking courtyard,"Stayed for two nights 17/18th September, great welcome from staff given a nice cold glass of fresh orange juice and some nibbles, suite was nice but have had nicer ones before, sadly we received bad service at breakfast, so we had to speak to general manager they said they would deal with it, when we got back from our day out we were asked if we wanted dinner on the house, we had a large lunch so declined, but whilst we were watching the rugby in there cinema they provided us with lovely sandwiches and fab service, it was sad we had to complain in first place, hotel is very charming, the pool isn't warm beware!!! Essouria is much more laid back than Marrakech,",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2015,4,Throwback to a bygone era,This is a beautiful hotel which is a complete contrast to Essouria. You step into another world when you step through the door. It's perfectly located on the edge of the Medina but a complete escape from the streets of the town. The staff were friendly not soulless and will help with any issues you may have. The rooms are classically furnished with beautiful walk in showers. There is not a lot of storage space but enough for a few nights. Prices are higher than average but you expect that. It has tea and coffee facilities which is novel these days. The courtyard area is to due for: a sea of calm and tranquility which huge natural palm trees. There is a great terrace with a large swimming pool and views over the medina.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,Stunning hide-away...,"This hotel was stunning. A masterpiece behind some grand blue doors. Aesthetically, it was the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in - the layout, decor and ethos was amazing and every day fresh fruit was left in your room. Brekkie fantastic, lots of fresh fruit, fresh eggs and the Director came around all of the tables every morning to say hello. The swimming pool at the top - fab. (Lunch a little rich, not many snack things so I'd suggest getting it in the town). Staff were lovely and kind and there were lots nooks around the hotel to go and sit and relax. Wifi is not great anywhere in the hotel but who needs that anyway!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 July 2015,5,"Top-flight establishment, centrally located","This is beautiful, top-flight property on the edge of the relatively small medina. So it is easy to walk to just about anywhere of interest in the town. We stayed in the upper-floor suites, which are very spacious and have lovely furnishings. The central courtyard, where the fine breakfast is served, is lush and welcoming. The staff is friendly and generally well-organized. There is a rooftop pool — but remember, it’s always windy here, so it might seem chilly, even in the middle of summer.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,A pearl in the Medina,"The hotel in the medina is magnificent. We stayed in two beautiful adjacent suites/rooms. Breakfast, lunch on the rooftop and dinner were excellent. I truly appreciated the hospitality of the whole team. The hotel is small; they really make the difference by giving you a personal service that you cannot find in large hotels. Many thanks for your friendliness and assistance!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,Quiet Oasis!,Stayed here for 3 nights in August. Greeted with fresh orange juice and delicious biscuits in the wonderful courtyard. This hotel is full of character and quiet from the medina of essaouira. We stayed in a Classic Room which was clean and well decorated. The breakfast was amazing. So much variety and fresh pancakes made to order. Staff were extremely polite and attentive. Swimming pool was an added bonus for relaxation and drinks by the pool. A wonderful place to stay and already planning next year's visit!,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Best place in town,"A beautifully renovated old palace with friendly, attentive service and stunning rooftop pool/terrace. Very comfortable stylish rooms and well located just within the Medina walls and also close to the Supratour bus station if you have travelled from Marrakech as we had. A word of advice (and nothing to do with the hotel) - Don't ride camels on the beach unless you fancy a trip to Essaouira's A&E department!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Saved our holiday,"We were supposed to stay in Maison de Cinema in the medina, but our first night there was quite bad. Uncomfortable, noisy, not clean at all. So we booked the best we could find in essaouira. This hotel saved our holiday and made it so much better than we imagined. The service was top-notch, the rooms were great and the rooftop with pool is just wonderful! During our stay my girlfriend got sick from eating somewhere in the medina. We were so happy with the additional care this hotel provided. They took special care for her dinner when she wasn't feeling well. They upgraded our room just for her comfort and arranged a doctor to take care of her. Afterwards they also brought her the medicines. I would like to say a big thank you to the people that did this as it saved our…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2015,4,Stunning Riad in the Medina,"What's not to like. The building itself is in the riad style with a colonial flavour, arranged over 4 floors with a large, lushly planted central courtyard dotted with tables. This is where one enjoys the lovely breakfast buffet, replete with Moroccan specialities including made to order crepes and little pancakes. There is a rooftop pool and restaurant ( a tad on the windy side, but it's Essaouria and it's always windy!). The rooms are really large and perfectly appointed with lovely touches such as Moroccan sweets set out in the evening. Comfy beds, blackout curtains and a good shower complete that checklist! The staff very on top of things if a bit on the stiff side. The location is right in the Medina so handy for shopping and restaurants, everything is only a short…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2015,4,Best riad in the medina!!!,"Very nice welcoming, amazing food, service is pleasant and very attentive. We spent a few hours with the chef for a cooking class and he showed us how to make the small breads and the famous couscous. The swimming pool is beautiful on the rooftop but sometimes can be a little windy. The rooms are good but a little old or maybe the bathroom could be re-done. But all is functional and comfy. We spent a wonderful week. Thanks to the whole team at L'heure bleue Palais!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2015,5,Fantastic stay in Essaouia,"This was the last of three hotels we stayed in whilst in Morrocco .See other reviews for Kazbah Angour and Les Jardins de La Medina. This is a stunning building with rooms on three levels over the ground floor around a central courtyard with a pool and cafe restaurant on the roof. Everything about this hotel was first class. It is located just inside the Medina at Bab Marrakech so within easy walking distance of the town, port and ancient walls. We had a suite on the second floor which was like a bedroom cum lounge. The fixtures and fittings throughout the hotel were very olde world but beautifully maintained. It reminded us of what a Gentleman's club might have been like in the thirties or forties. The English bar was a lovely relaxing spot to sip a quiet drink and the dining…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2015,4,Peaceful haven in beautiful seaside setting,"Spent three nights at this lovely hotel after three hectic days in Marrakech. Thoroughly enjoyed the peace in the centre courtyard, the lovely sun terrace on the roof with amazing views and the excellent food and service. Yet one step outside the door and you were in the heart of the bustle of the side streets of Essaouira. We had a lovely room with a small balcony overlooking the square just outside the medina. Slightly noisy if we opened the window but enjoyed the people watching. Room was serviced frequently with fresh fruit, biscuits and bottles of water replaced every day. We enjoyed dinner twice at the hotel and the Berber couscous was accompanied by local live musicians. Lunch on the sun terrace is to be highly recommended - the tuna sandwich with French fries was the…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2015,5,A stay at this Riad should be on everyone's bucket list !,"We were pleased to get to Essaouira after 5 hectic days in Marrakech and when we arrived at the HB all hecticness dissolved into tranquility beyond imagination. Old enough to have seen ""Road to Morroco"" many times I remembered Bob and Bing always sported a sailors hat whilst chasing Dot about the place so I wore a Captains hat most of the time in the HB, I fooled the staff initially but they soon realised I was no VIP in fact just a prat in a hat. At the end of the 9 wonderful days we spent at the HB the staff got their revenge on me in the form of our room bill; I had been indulging in Glenlivet single malt most nights in the Salon Anglais before repairing to our bedroom, little did i realise while sipping and dreaming away in the opulent surroundings of the SA (grand piano,…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2015,5,Superb location,"This riad style hotel is superbly located, built into the ramparts of the old medina. Old-fashioned haven of calm inside, palm and fountains in a central courtyard with armchairs to relax in, this area is also used for breakfast in morning. The comfortable and well-appointed bedrooms are situated on the balconies around the courtyard and decorated and furnished in Moroccan style. After a morning in the town or a day's activities the roof terrace, with pool, is just the place to relax with maybe a spot of lunch or a drink. We found the staff to be very good, friendly and efficient. All in all, Essaouira is a good town to relax at the end of a holiday and L'Heure Bleue Palais a good hotel to relax in.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

The hotel and staff exude old world charm and style, e.g. cinema and billiards rooms in the IPad age ! Could imagine Bogart drinking a martini in the Salon Anglais. The rooftop terrace is a great place to relax, lunch and sip a drink in the sun, with a refreshing sea breeze. This was important as we did not find Essaouira especially relaxing or welcoming, particularly for blonde ladies who want to wear shorts on a hot day (so much for bohemian spirit) ! Would recommend a room facing the central garden, as ours had a street ""view"" (not really a view) and the garden is a fabulous space.

 October 2014,5,A trip to a bygone era,"Beautiful building with large, comfortable rooms and an extensive breakfast in a light and glorious courtyard. As Essaouira is a windy city the fire they lit in our room was an unexpected treat and added to the romance. Ideally situated within the medina yet is has a pool on the roof. The water is very cold but , while not full -sized, it was just about big enough to swim in, a rarity. Prices are expensive of course. But if you want to treat yourself after days in Marrakech or the desert, it has all the creature comforts. One warning. When I was there they were having problems with credit card machines. I had the same experience in other hotels. In case that's still the case best to leave extra time for check out if you're jumping on a bus straight after.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

Large wooden doors were opened to reveal the hotel in all its glory. What an oasis. So ornate and luxurious . Check in while served fresh orange and sweets, room 4 was ours and what a treat of old colonialism fixtures. Perfect Time to explore.

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a spacious suite with windows facing the street that enters the medina. While some might prefer complete quiet, we loved keeping our windows open so that we could enjoy the sounds of the street. The hotel has a wonderful central courtyard and lovely rooftop deck. It was too cold in March for us to try the pool but it would be great in warm weather.

 April 2015,4,"Very lovely, just a few issues.","We stayed here for 3 nights over Easter and overall, we had a lovely time. Location is great; right on the edge of the medina. The hotel itself is very small - just a tall building with no grounds at all, but in the heart of the medina that's what you'd expect. Lovely central courtyard with rooms either facing out over the medina or into the courtyard. The highlight for me was the lovely roof terrace - with a lovely (if freezing!) pool and lots of nice places to sit or sunbathe, and it never felt crowded. The breakfasts were lovely too, with a lady making fresh Moroccan pancakes. Our room was fine; they are all on the small side and pretty dark generally.

It is easy to find your way around and you don't experience the hassle you do in Marrakech. We loved it. This Riad is top notch on every level. Rooms, food, staff, swimming pool. It has a laid back but friendly ambience. It was pretty windy when we visited and sometimes breakfast on the patio could be quite chilly. Sunday lunch at the swimming pool should not be missed.

As soon as a patron enters, he is swept into another world of luxury. The hotel is very atmospheric and elegantly decorated. However, it is the service that is truly superb. This starts with the check in when you are greeted with hot towels and appetizers while seated in a garden in the hotel’s center. So much nicer than standing in a reception line as you normally find at most hotels. The rooms, restaurant, hamman, pool, and breakfast buffet are all outstanding, but what makes this hotel really special is the staff. My husband became ill and desperately needed medical attention.

 April 2015,2,Dissapointment in a Relais & Chateaux in Essaouira,"We spent one night, Wednesday 15 April in suite 18 of this hotel. Problems: at three in the morning, trying to turn on the light we find out the suite was out of electricity. Calls to reception and visit by electrician who switching keys on and off made electricity return….for ten minutes and then blackout again; so, I did the same as the electrician but leaving a different key down (off) and we recovered our lights. The toilet door will not close, no matter what: it is not very delicate for anybody. There is no light in the seating part of the suite, only a picture lightly illuminated: impossible to read. There is no power outlet anywhere near the desk so you can’t plug your computer, phone and what have you. On the positive: staff is courteous and correct and the hotel…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2015,5,Very classy hotel,"An elegant hotel on the edge of the Medina, with great rooms and very frielndly, helpful staff. The food seems expensive, so we ate elsewhere, but it's a great place to stay and easy to access the highlights of Essaouira from there.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2015,5,Wonderful place!,"We spent four days in Essaouira at L'Heure Blue. The weather have not been fantastic, but this hotel made the stay something to remember: the room was very comfortable, well equipped and stylish in each detail; the lounge and the patio very warm, but the personnel is the real plus of this place: friendly, always ready to help and take care of the customer, charming, great group of people! The Restaurant as well is first class, very good choice of plates, Moroccan cuisine both traditional and revisited, very interesting Moroccan wines. A place to go!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2015,5,Stunning Hotel in an amazing location,"Hotel chosen from a brochure based on location and amenities.Hotel didn't disappoint in any way.The location in the Medina in Essaouira was very different from any other place we've ever visited.Entirely different culture from every aspect-language,people,life styles,cuisine,shopping etc.Service at the hotel was outstanding in every way,from the breakfast room in the riad up to the rooftop pool and grill bar.The premium restaurant on the ground floor was sumptuously furnished and the dishes were wonderfully prepared and served.The room was well appointed and serviced with soft comfortable beds.Even a log fire if required! This hotel's greatest asset was without exception,the wonderful attentive, and friendly staff.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2015,4,Loved the location,"Hotel is in the medina of Essaouira, easy walking to everything interesting. The hammam is exceptional. Breakfast is very French, including croissants...and pork products...but also included almond butter with argan oil, a local specialty. We were spoiled from staying in smaller riads, so this place didn't seem as special, because it is a bit larger. It is a lovely place, and the staff is extremely nice.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2015,5,Excellent & Amazing,"I decided to take 4 days off to manage to assume my heavy workload of the moment. When I arrived at l'Heure Bleue, I found a real harvest of peace and tranquility. Everything is made for you to be able to relax. Employees are so delicate in the way they treat you. Always a nice word, always very discreet as well. As I worked very efficiently for the 2 first days, I also have the opportunity to go on a fantastic road trip organized by the hotel, out of the traditional tourism paths : ""les moments d'exception"" We visited the Heure Bleue vineyard, and had lunch with local people : I will remember this forever. It was also the opportunity to find myself again, far away from everything I used to know, from everywhere I used to be.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2015,5,Wonderful Riad,"I can only sing the praises of this hotel. The location, right on the wall of the medina, was very convenient. It is only a 5 minute walk to the beach and around the same to be right in the centre of the medina. All the staff are very attentive and well mannered. We did not speak French, however we were still made to feel very welcome by both the staff and management. We ate in the restaurant one evening and on other evenings the staff booked us tables at local restaurants O'Bleu Mogador, Elizir and Silvestro, all of which were good. Breakfast was amazing with a vast array of fresh fruit, pastries and freshly cooked Moroccan pancakes. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2015,5,"Amazingly excellent, elegant hotel. My wife and I adored it.","I have read a number of other reviews of this hotel that are mixed. It is often said that he who critiques says more about himself than that which he is critiquing, and some of these reviews bear this out. One person, whose review is prominently highlighted, takes great exception to the noise and bustle and smells outside the hotel. There are La Quinta's in Las Vegas best suited for this individual. This is Morocco, and that's just how it is here. Another person objects to the fact that it was cold and windy. Certainly there are fancier hotels that can adjust the outside temperature and wind; go to them. Another person feels the hotel is too dark (despite the fact that there is a massive interior courtyard open to the sky and windows everywhere). Again, there are many…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2015,5,Perfect for exploring Essaouira,"We chose this hotel after considerable research and studying trip advisor! It is on the edge of the Medina- so we expected some noise, but staying in such a beautiful , traditionally designed house more than made up for it ... We found all staff to be friendly and responsive. A word of warning- it is still early in the year and breakfast is al fresco in the beautiful courtyard, designed to keep out the sun. Take a sweater ! The food was wonderful , both in the restaurant and the Terrace. We have stayed at many Relais and Chateaux and loved Heure Bleue for its Moroccan ambience.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2015,2,Oh dear!,"Right on the town walls/Medina, the hotel overlooked a busy (vehicle-wise) square and a pedestrian & motorcycle thoroughfare. The overall impression of the internal of the hotel was one of darkness – not unsurprising given that all the wood was black or thereabouts. The overpowering smell of drains resulted in us being moved - but still the Suite, through extremely small (single glazed) windows, overlooked the roof tops - piles of rotting rubbish and sat dishes. In spite of asking for a quiet room, the suite was anything but - with incessant traffic noise and at night, children playing. Incidentally, very limited tv channels but a dvd was available.

 February 2015,4,Excellent location,"This hotel is situated on the edge of the Souk, convenient for the old town and the beachfront. Essaouira is very windy so it was nice to enter the palm-filled courtyard and relax. We were greeted by efficient, friendly staff with the usual orange juice and biscuits. Our room was on the second floor but there is a lift. It was spacious with a comfortable bed, large sitting area and bathroom with bath and separate shower. We only had to ask and our fire would have been lit but we were warm enough without. We went out to dinner but breakfast the next morning was the usual international fare, maybe a lttle disappointing as we had been used to typical Moroccan breakfasts in other hotels we had stayed in.

 February 2015,3,"Great location, beautiful old hotel, sadly without soul","We (family of five) stayed here for 2 nights. The location is perfect - right on the edge of the old town and the hotel itself is beautiful, however, the atmosphere and service disappointed. The only member of staff who genuinely charmed and interacted with us was the doorman. Management is helpful but heartless. Some Moroccans work in the hotel, but this place definitely does not communicate the usual Moroccan soul. Guests are made to feel like a paying guest, nothing more, and service at breakfast and during dinner is erratic and quite unfriendly. We had to wait for more than an hour for our room to be cleaned on arrival, although the hotel was expecting us.

 February 2015,4,Not quite as good as it should have been,"This is a very good hotel with a high reputation. The building is stunning, arranged around a large palm filled courtyard with the swimming pool and sun bathing terrace located on the roof. It is on the edge of the medina and an easy walk to the harbour and town centre. The bar is quite dark and can be a little gloomy. Our room was ok but nothing more than that and everything worked in the bathroom which is always helpful. We enjoyed the breakfasts and ate dinner twice in the restaurant, pricey but well cooked and presented. We enjoyed the hotel but in truth the service was just a bit lack lustre. Sometimes it was difficult when in the bar to attract anyones attention. We made a dinner reservation that didn't find its way to the restaurant and things generally moved fairly…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

Low key entrance just behind a square, lovely courtyard filled with palms and little pools, served freshly squeezed orange juice and pastries on arrival. Decided to brave a hammam experience with my partner- we were pampered with steam room, doused with warm water, covered in black soap, scrubbed intensley and left to soak in a soothing body mask before a quick but relaxing argon oil massage. Left feeling like newborns! Very nice room and big bathroom ( although shower over bath hard to clamber into and hand held shower) along with complimentary tea and more pastries!

 February 2015,5,"Fantastic place, brilliant staff","We stayed only one night as a day out from Marrakech. It's a very unassuming building on the outside, very close to town and docks, but once inside it's an amazing and beautiful Riad. We were upgraded to a suite which was very well appointed and comfortable. We spent a couple of hours lying by the pool in the afternoon (the pool was very cold as it was early Feb and pool not heated). In the evening we had a hammam which was fantastic. We didn't eat in the hotel in the evening but it looked very nice. The breakfast was a real treat and very nice to be able to sit in the open courtyard. All round a really enjoyable experience and highly recommended.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 February 2015,5,great hotel and location,"Traveling with Abercrombie & Kent we stayed at some of the top hotels in Morocco and this was our favorite. The location is just inside the medina and the building is wonderful. Although the rooms were not very large, they had great attention to detail and were very well furnished. We were there in February and could not enjoy the roof top pool but see how it could be a great place to come and relax in warmer months. We also enjoyed the village within the medina. It is smaller than many of the famous medinas in Morocco but easy to get around with many choices of excellent restaurants within walking distance",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,"Great hotel, best in town for sure!","Moved from another hotel to this one, no regrets at all! Great place, decoration and ambiance! Regular rooms are not big, but quite comfortable.

 January 2015,4,Old school style and quality,"A perfect place from which to enjoy all that Essaouira has to offer. A welcome, serene retreat within the walls of the medina and only a short walk from the beach. Nothing here is too much trouble. The staff are wonderful, the food is outstanding. Breakfast being an absolute treat, dinner exquisite. Suites are cozy and spacious with real wood fires. The only negative would be the spa...didn't quite meet expectations, but a relaxing experience all the same.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,Quality,Everything about this fantastic riad is wonderful. The building is decorated in the old Moroccan style. Our room was a second floor suite which was spacious and comfortable.

The only glitch was trying to find a bartender one night.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,Delightful hotel with genuinely hospitable and courteous staff.,"This was our fourth visit to L'Heure Bleue. Whilst the beach in Essaouira is stunning, it is perhaps the hotel which draws us back. It seems that this is a hotel which attracts loyal and dedicated staff, many of whom have been working in the hotel for some time and are genuinely welcoming. It is so delightful to return to the hotel after a walk on the beach: the central courtyard beautifully presented,all of the public areas are full of character and very attractive. If the weather is chilly sometimes (well, it was winter when we were there) there is a cosy fire in the bar. when tHhe sun shines there is a rooftop terrace where lunch can be so.

 December 2014,5,"Outstanding service, very attentive staff","A very quaint hotel with a beautiful courtyard. Excellent location in Essaouria. We were upgraded to suites which were large, not ultra luxurious but very nice nonetheless. Rooms were lit with candles every night for turndown. But the most amazing thing about the hotel was it's staff who were amongst the best i have come across anywhere, genuine, helpful , dedicated. There was pretty much no request that was turned down, whether it was fresh aloe vera juice in the morning or organising our very own Gnawa music ceremony. Housekeeping were great too, all our clothes etc were neatly folded and organised.

 December 2014,5,Just perfect,"Beautifully restored building at the entrance to medina - just in the center of town. Main Essaouira beach is just 10 minutes walking away. After arrival we were offered a welcome drink - superb experience. We stayed at the hotel during low season and got upgrade to Deluxe room (they have balconies facing outside of the hotel, all other rooms are facing to inner patio). Rooftop terrace is a world of its own. The pool was quite cold, but after my request the staff turned heating on and later the pool had 28 degrees (in December). Breakfast is also a nice experience, we had our private buffet... Staff is very kind and helpful. Hotel also has its own hammam, which is quite expensive (extra cost). All in all very nice experience (5 stars).",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2014,5,Amazing Location,"This riad, more like a boutique hotel, is located just steps into the magical Essaouira medina.

The spa here is also good, offering traditional treatments such as a Hammam.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2014,4,Slick and comfortable and very handy,"As seems to be so often the case in Morocco, noise and bustle (and large holes in the ground in this particular case) can be happening literally outside the door, but all remains calm and serene inside. This stately place worked its charms gradually.(It was always going to have a tough job coming after Kasbah Tamadot). Our upgraded room, with all its traditional shutters was lovely - a good roomy bath too. But what I remember most is the outstanding breakfasts. Quince jam, apple and saffron jam, delicious pastries... Service is excellent and turn right out of the front door and you are in the thick of things in moments. All in all, a very nice place to stay.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Wonderful,"We thought this place was wonderful. Obviously it is expensive but We thought the staff were excellent, without exception. We stayed 3 nights. It is a Riad rather than a normal hotel but has everything you could wish for. The restaurant is expensive but we ate there 3 times and thought it delivered exquisite food - arguably 'fussy' or 'over engineered ' as a previous review said - but it probably deserves a Michelin star for food. If you want 'rustic' go into the Medina. Service is very good but some additional attention to detail required , eg: tell the guest something isn't available when he sits down, not when her orders. The hotel is in the Medina. A bonus in my opinion. Straight out of the door into the action.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,Wonderful Welcoming Hotel,"We stayed at L'Heure Bleue in the beginning of October for two nights. You walk through a tall door that opens onto a teaming street in the old part of the city, a short walk from the seaside. Inside you are greeted with a lushly planted courtyard decorated in an evocative Moroccan style. The rooms are comfortable, but you need to ask for one with a balcony. We ate dinner at the restaurant and it was superb. The staff were attentive and helpful. It is good to tour Essaouira with a private guide who can show you the magic of this city.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 September 2014,3,Pretty good...,"I wish I could put 3.5. Nice enough, but we thought it was a riad. It was bigger and less personal than what we expected - not ridiculously clean, and slightly damp (likely owing to the proximity to the sea). But staff was friendly enough, it was clean enough... it was alright. It kind've felt like the style and feel of a nice all-inclusive in Mexico or Dominican.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,Excellent Riad,"We stayed at L'heure Bleue at the start of October. It has a beautiful courtyard where guests can peacefully eat meals, have a drink of choice or simply relax. The rooms are nice, though nothing special. What makes this riad special are the people, who are very helpful and attentive. Their recommendations for tourist services were excellent (with the exception of the surfing shop, which they should excise from their list of vendors). The food was superb. We especially recommend a lesson in Moroccan cooking from Chef Handour. It was one of the highlights of our two weeks in the country. It is located only about 10 meters inside of the walls oft the medina and so very easy to find, provided that you know which of the 4 gates it is near.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2014,4,Colonial charm,We visited this hotel as part of a 2 weeks holiday in Morocco with my wife and my 3.5 years old daughter. This hotel has a lot of colonial character and we liked it very much. All furnitures are in dark wood. The hotel offers a parking for the guests which is constantly monitored. We had a suite which was unfortunately facing the outside wall of the medina and that was a bit noisy at times. Breakfast was served in the internal yard and was very tasty and offered a good variety. The pool area located on the roof top provides a very good and quiet alternative to the at times chaotic life in the medina. The wifi while free of charge was a bit slow We used the restaurant only once and we found it totally overpriced and not that good (dishes were over engineered and spiced). The room…,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

The ideal way to visit Essaouira.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2014,4,Highlight of our 2 week stay in Morocco,"3 of us spent an all too short 2 nights in this lovely hotel. The location is fantastic, at the edge of the medina. This is a great place to go shopping with the added benefit of a short trip back to the hotel to deposit the booty! From the minute we arrived to the time of departure we were treated with curtesy, friendliness and great professionalism. The open area is a lovely oasis. Check in, which wasn't a great experience in other hotels on our trip, was really well done. Being greeted by fresh orange juice and the nicest biscuits ever was lovely. The manager greeted us which made the experience even better. We were very kindly upgraded, the suites are absolutely gorgeous. The terrace was great- birds eye view of the medina and the sunsets. Lovely relaxing place. The bathroom…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2014,4,Great roof terrace,Stayed here for 3 nights on first floor overlooking atrium. We arrived here after 8 hour drive from Skoura frazzled! Cool towels and welcome drink hit the spot. Rooms and towels could do with TLC. Food and service here was very good. Having already contracted a tummy bug whilst eating outside our previous hotels decided to play safe and eat and drink in hotel we were not dissapointed nice choice of food and Moroccan wine good if a little pricey. Great roof terrace with really attentive staff on hand. All in all an enjoyable stay,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,Should get a Michelin star,"In a two week Morocco stay this was our favorite hotel, and others were twice the price. The atrium setting is truly unique and an incredibly peaceful spot at any time of day. Our suite was uniquely Moroccan but comfortable for westerners. Do not miss dinner at threir wonderful restaurant with classical guitarist and great lighting. The cuisine was best in Morocco, continental with Moroccan hints. Definitely deserves one Michelin star!!!! Staff were all attentive and helpful and most hospitable. We hope to come back.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,Restful and charming,"I spent 2 nights in this typical Moroccan riad which is ideally located in the medina and also very close to the beach. It is a very quiet place where the manager and his staff obviously feel concerned by providing a lot of personal and delicate attention to the guests while remaining also nicely discreet. Breakfast is simply excellent just like the food I had for dinner. Special thanks to Naima at the reception who made her best to accomodate each of my requests, always smiling. Rooms are well equipped and nicely decorated. Congratulations to all the team! I highly recommend and for sure will return.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2014,3,Just a tad disappointing,"This was the second part of my visit to Morocco. After a three hour drive from Marrakech arrived to the hotel just after mid day. Reception staff were polite and I was offered tea whilst I waited for the room to be ready. The twin bedded room was on the first floor with ensuite shower and bathroom. The air conditioning is controlled centrally. So it was difficult to get the temperature right. It was a little noisy too as the service lift was just around the corner. Overall the room decor is a little tired, the towels need replacing. However on the upside the food was delicious. The breakfast buffet was sumptuous with lots of choice, fresh fruit, fresh juices, cold meats, cheese, pastries and delicious coffee. However the omelettes were not that good. The dinner menus,…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2014,3,Could be so much better,"Stayed at L'Heure Bleue for 4 nights - immediate reaction was good but soon found that this is not a typical Relais & Châteaux establishment. The twin room we shared was very small and smelled musty with poor air conditioning which was either on or off.... when we commented on this to the front desk we were advised that the AC was controlled centrally; maybe it needs to be updated? Bath and hand towels have seen distinctly better days - indeed the most shabby I have ever used in a hotel anywhere! The staff have a policy of greeting you as per their 'mission statement', just wish it felt sincere and not mechanical.

The 3 story building is open on all sides to the tranquil inner courtyard where they took the weary travellers (Who had just braved Marrakech traffic and driven a further 150 odd miles) and set them down, whisking away their passports and luggage to fill in the required forms with the first and dispatch the latter to the room.

And on entering its portals....it had the wow effect....courtyard with a mini-forest through the reception area. Everything in the hotel was brilliant...with a couple of exceptions. Breakfast great, lovely staff, shower was brilliant...and roof terrace, with pool, is magnificent. We had dinner out each evening...as we wanted some authentic Moroccan, rather than hotel food. We arrrived an hour or two before checkin time, but we did not have to wait to get to our room. Two exceptions ....wi-fi a bit dodgy and slow at times.

 September 2014,4,"Slightly Pricey, good but room for improvement","Stayed for 4 nights in a standard room - like other guests we had to wait for room to be ready, but drink and nibbles filled the gap. Staff all very friendly, helpful and welcoming. Only quibbles would be that snacks, e.g. at the pool are a bit pricey (approx £17 for a club sandwich). While you do get a reasonable amount and it is well presented, it makes lounging by the pool all day an expensive choice and also means not many takers - a slightly lower price may encourage more guests to eat there. Could also do with tea / coffee making facilities in the room as you don't always want to call room service or head downstairs for a coffee. Other than that a nice hotel and would consider staying again.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,Tranquil oasis in bustling medina,"This is a beautiful, old colonial style hotel with amazing suites and very friendly, attentive staff. Located just inside the Medina but close to the beach, it is ideally situated with the huge, added benefit of a massive swimming pool on the rooftop (especially as the beach can be windy). Our room was amazing but initially the a/c was not working and then never very effective which was a shame. The pool area was lovely but small gripe - there were insufficient sunbeds - this happened on 2 occasions although the staff were very good at identifying ones for us as people left.

 August 2014,5,Best hotel experience I will probably ever have!,"This was the first hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon to Morocco, and although all three hotels we stayed in were amazing, L'Heure Bleue had the edge. From the moment we arrived and were treated to fresh orange juice and Moroccan nibbles, to the moment we left after five fabulous days, we couldn't fault a thing. The staff were attentive and really delightful; nothing was too much trouble. The room was spacious and characterful and the bathroom was great with a powerful shower and lovely Moroccan toiletries.

After a further 30 mins we enquired again at reception and were told the room was still not ready. We were not too bothered and knew they were doing their best but 10 mins later we were shown to our beautiful upgraded suite. A very welcome treat.

 August 2014,2,Mostly Average - Good location though,"Overall a disappointing experience compared with other fabulous properties and Riads in Morocco, it's a shame to leave a negative review when the grounds and entrance are quite lovely. Our room was not cleaned properly, the bathtub was full of short and curly's! You would've had to be blind to miss them (cleaner did rectify as soon as I called). We had no shower which is fine, however the handheld head on the bath tap was a joke! The water dribbled out and fluctuated in temperature so much that you either got scolded or froze with no in between, it was impossible to wash my long hair, fine I thought I'll have a bath in stead....

 June 2014,3,"Great Location, Average Accommodations","My friends and I stayed at the L'Heure Bleue on a recent trip to Essaouira. Recently restored to approximate its old glory, the hotel boasts of a great location and great surroundings. It's central patio is a peaceful oasis from the hustle and bustle of the medina and the winds of the beach town. Upon arrival, the team provides you with a delicious selection of Moroccan pastries, mint tea, and fresh squeezed orange juice. The team is very amiable, willing to help in any way, but expect the service will be similar to the pace of a beach town. Definitely a bit more relaxed. While the room service food options were good, the breakfast buffet does not offer as much optionality as you would expect from this R&C hotel chains. While the surroundings were beautifully cared for, the…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2014,5,Awesome Service in the heart of the medina.,This hotel from start to finish was excellent! The absolute highlight of the trip was the private cooking class with the Head Chef Ahmed. My son and I were treated to high expertise and a fun amazing meal. He was attentive and joyful and you can feel the pride in his cooking and teaching. We learned a new method for extracting seafood from crustaceans and its amazing. The property is in the heart of the medina with easy walking distance to a beautiful beach and beach boardwalk. You will also be at the beginning of shopping area. The room we were in faced the courtyard and was a comfortable room.

The internal courtyard is styled in a French colonial fashion, with rattan furniture with Palm trees towering up the centre. The rooms all open on to terraces that look down on to the central courtyard. On the roof, the sun terrace pool and bar provide a tranquil place to relax. The staff are very polite and helpful, and no worries about tipping every time as they have a box at reception when you leave. The restaurant is a bit pricy but the food and service were excellent .

It is right on the edge of the Medina near one of the old entry gates. It is quiet and tranquil when you come through the front door from the busy street outside. The rooms were great with very quiet air conditioning units and huge baths. The hotel has a colonial feel with lots of oak paneling and leather. The Pool on the roof has great views and lots of very comfortable loungers and shady areas. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, something we found in all the hotels we stayed in during our visit to Morocco. We didn't eat at the hotel as it worked out around £60 a head which was quite expensive for four of us. There are lots of good inexpensive hotels within walking…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

A great wow factor with the old charm and gentlemens club feel to it. The central topical plant courtyard is a delight, and a lovely place for your breakfast. The rooms are smaller and very French looking all facing into the courtyard but again charming. The roof top terrace is a beautiful spot for lunch and tanning although the poolside waiter needs to go to charm school and smile and be nice to his guests. He has that Parisienne pout! Breakfast is basic and disappointing. Looks impressive but really there is nothing much to eat. It is a wonderful little find for a few nights but it is very French in its running and appeal.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

The old palace has kept its 19th century attributes, including to quite an extent in its suites, where you can still feel part of its history. The service is impeccable for any request you may have, and the staff is certainly very well behaved. The food is excellent served in either an authentically decorated restaurant or outside in the patio which boasts an impressive quietness; Plunging into the rooftop swimming pool is a must not to ne missed.

The dramatic entrance into a courtyard of palm trees looks very impressive at night when lit in colors. The staff is friendly and helpful (though most of them don't speak English well) and the breakfast spread is delicious and never-ending (try the different jams). The pool deck is also a wonderful space to lounge and relax. Our tapas in the bar were also delicious. Although we didn't eat at the restaurant, a local chef from Lyon told us it's her favorite restaurant in town. The bedrooms are gorgeous but the only windows face the courtyard -- at least in the regular rooms. As a result they are a little dark.

If possible book a suite where the room is comfortable and where you have a good size ensuite bathroom with both a bath and shower. The restaurant has a tremendous range of authentic Morocco food and a good wine list with local wines featuring in good measure.

It turned out to be good, not great. We stayed at the Palais Heure Bleue for two nights traveling as a family (2 adults, 2 kids). The hotel was well maintained, clean, and had comfortable furnishings. It's a good location right at the edge of the medina and a quick walk to the beach. We were warmly welcomed, served complimentary juice and snacks while we relaxed in the spacious inner courtyard (our rooms were being prepared).

I was a little sceptical when we arrived after driving from Marrakeh. From the outside it doesn't look like much but don't let appearances fool you. I was stunned by how beautiful the hotel was from the inside. The courtyard is just amazing - an excellent buffet breakfast, and dinner are both served here.

Our junior suite was fantastic and the little curtained window seat a joy! The breakfast was great and our 2nd dinner in the restaurant very pleasant.

After a long day of travel, we arrived at the hotel about 11 30 pm. Once inside, there was a warm welcome from the receptionist, who took us to our junior suite- room 29. It was a spacious room with a walk in shower, two sinks and a bath. There was separate toilet with a window. Plenty of towels and bath products were provided.

My room had a tub with hand held shower, but no place to mount the shower head. Had I noticed the setup prior to my first shower I would have asked to change rooms. Taking a bath was next to impossible as the hot water pressure was very weak. Maintenance came and looked at the problem, but said there was nothing they could do. We ate lunch on the roof top terrace and dinner in the main dining room. While both locations are aesthetically pleasing, the meals were very expensive and of average quality.

We could not make ourselves a cup of tea as there were no tea or coffee making facilities. We called reception and were transferred to the Reception Manager. We were advised that these facilities were not provided and that if we wanted drinks we should call room service, I replied that this would prove very expensive and as I had my own tea bags could hot water be supplied. This met with a very surly response, however an agreement was reached. The following morning I phoned for my hot water it arrived – tepid water in two very badly chipped black cups !!!

The rooms are fine, not large and the cupboard space is not great but well looked after and comfortable. Excellent food in the restaurant and the staff were more than willing to suggest other restaurants and how to get there.

My wife and I chose Essaouira as the destination for our first wedding anniversary, and figured we may as well splash out on L'Heure Bleue Palais for this special occasion. Three things became very clear early on: The riad is perfectly placed as a base for exploring Essaouira, being located very near one of the main entrances of the town (i.e. a short stroll from your airport transfer coach to the front door) and within easy walking distance of everything else; the riad staff are…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

Fab ground floor courtyard for b'fast, drinks, with bar (old English drawing room feel) and upmarket restaurant...you wouldn't want to eat here every night, which is fine as loads of great restaurants within walking distance. Essaouira is a calmer, gentler, medina type city than say Marrakech and easy to find your way. Weather great, but quite windy as it is on the Atlantic Coast.

Our room was very nice- small, but nice and delightfully decorated. My negatives about it- only one place for a suitcase and no air-con. You could open a window but no screens and lots of noise from outside in the courtyard. As 2 singles I would have preferred beds to be a bit more apart from each other not jammed together so closely.

The decor is fabulous and service superb. Our only complaint and the only reason for not giving a 5 star rating, is the quality of the one main meal we had there. We knew meals were expensive here, but as with all good hotels we did expect good quality. Unfortunately we did not find this the case.

On the roof terrace a beautiful swimming pool with a breathtaking panorama of the city and the ocean. Quite dear, but the good experience worth the money spent.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2013,5,Best hotel in Essaouira!,"I always stay at L'Heure Bleue. Just fantastic. The personnel is very gentle. The hotel so clean, a fantastic smell. A breakfast never to forget. The spa is worth going. I do recommend it to anyone going to Essaouira. No doubt is one of the best hotels in Morocco!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2013,3,Nice but pricey,"We treated ourselves to a night In the famous Heure Bleu Palace. We have been to morocco many times and we found this hotel lovely but quite overpriced. The pool upstairs is nice to hang out on, although we didn't relaize how windy Essaouira is during the summer. The rooms are comfy, the staff are friendly but a little inconsistent. We ate dinner at the restaurant and didn't really find the magic. The breakfast is amazing in the lovely courtyard and the spa is pretty good. The hotel keeps passports which seems like a pretty ancient practice, we travel a lot and haven't done this in years. stupidly we forgot to get our passports when we left although we were quite annoyed that the hotel didn't also hand them over automatically on checkout. We got to Marrakech and after a…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2013,5,Wonderful Place to Spend our Anniversary,"The L'Heure Bleue Palais is like an oasis of calm as you step off the bustling streets of the medina. We stayed as a couple for 4 nights at the end of June / start of July 2013. Everything from the beautiful welcome food and drinks (freshly squeezed OJ, ice cold water - much needed after our long journey, the juiciest dates known to man, and a plate of moroccan patisserie), to the unexpected upgrade to a suite, made for a perfect first wedding anniversary getaway. Incidentally, they didn't know it was our anniversary at that point so the upgrade must have been simply down to it being low season and the hotel not being fully booked. The whole place has a colonial feel to it, luxurious without being overly slick and modern (which I loved), and the staff incredibly friendly and…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2013,5,"Great hotel, very French","We stayed in this impressive converted colonial building and had a great time. It was a bit different from the other places we stayed - much more formal and French. This isn't a critisim - they offer first class service and accommodation in grand surroundings, with an air of Michelan-star about the food. The doorman and car-park attendant were especially friendly and helpful for us, but also the room was lovely (although the view a bit odd - Essaouira rooftops are a bit like Rio's favellas), the pool nice (but a bit windy, and the wall at the far end could do with a quick lick of paint), and the restaurant very impressive, and breakfast was an enormous spread. If you like all of lifes luxuries, this is the place for you!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2013,5,Authenticity and joie de vivre!,"To repay the exquisite hospitality of my friends in Marrakech, I have invited them to spend a long weekend in Essaouira, at the hotel L’Heure Bleu. Situated in the medina, but easy to get to, this old caravanserai has been transformed into a beautiful hotel by the owner, a Moroccan adviser of the King, known internationally for his culture, which has been able to renovate the building with great taste. Beautiful and immaculate rooms with comfortable beds. The service was perfect and excellent the food served: The beautiful terrace with a swimming pool offers serene moments of relax, under the splendid and clear sky of Essaouira. A place to consider for the authenticity and the joie de vivre of the past.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2013,3,Lovely but a bit stuffy,"We spent four nights at this property because my husband was determined to surf in Morocco. The beach was long a beautiful but it was very windy and the water cold. He was prepared with his wetsuit and was able to rent a board from a local outfit. The surfing was not great but worth it when he got to take a picture with him and the board on a camel! Success. This hotel is locate at one of the entrances to the medina and is a lovely, colonial style property. Our room was large and very lovely - especially the bathroom. The staff was kind and somewhat knowledgeable although we had just come from a very exceptional experience at the small riad - Dar les Cigognes - in Marrakech where the service was amazing and very personal making this property seem lacking. The pool and…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 May 2013,5,A taste of luxury,"We arrived here after a traumatic time with husband in hospital in Marrakech. Some relaxation was needed and a bit of pampering. We were upgraded to a fantastic suite and it was absolutely beautiful. Service excellent all round. Food out of this world. Dinner is not cheap here but it is beautiful and the salt baked fish is especially to be recommended. Wonderful views from the terrace too. The facial I had in the spa was a little disappointing - I had hoped for an hour of relaxation but it only lasted 3/4 hour and much of this time was spent being steamed and having pores ""dealt with"" - however the spa is lovely, the beautician was very sweet and the Sens de Marrakech products are heavenly.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,Marmite,"I loved this place, my partner did not. She hankered after the cool minimalism of our Marrakech Riad Dar-K. However I loved the colonial style, the staff who couldn't do enough for us and the wonderful suite that they put us in. The view from the roof was beautiful and the English Bar- just fantastic. I want to come back someday. The staff were fantastic- the doorman was right out of a Tintin book- huge, fez wearing and very smiley. The food at breakfast was lovely and the courtyard beautiful. We had a hammam at the hotel which was great fun, very naked and very invigorating. Wonderful.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,A palace... and you're the royalty!,"I can't recommend this highly enough. We had a lovely warm welcome with dates and tea followed by a guided tour of the hotel services. The rooftop pool was delightful with views over the town and sea and the complimentary fresh fruit kebabs were a generous refreshment. Breakfast was delicious, we loved the freshly made moroccan specialities. Our only comment would be that the food in the hotel is very expensive compared to some very nice restaurants in the medina, we spent a lot on dinner on our last night and had tagines which were not as good as we'd had elsewhere and were more than twice the price. The decor, staff and location are all excellent, we hope to return someday.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2013,4,Nice but a little tired,"Just inside the Medina in Essaouira is this pleasant Riad. Very comfortable and with good facilities, although they could have dispensed with cathode ray tube televisions. Only a short walk to the usual jumble of shops and stalls in the Souk. Just one word of warning, and this relates to the fish restaurants by the water. They are not as cheap or as good as they either could or should be. They cost of a meal of fish and sea food sitting on ""rustic"" wooden tables with similarly ordinary seating was nearly on a par with a first class restaurant in Fes. One is better off eating at a less fashionable place in town.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2012,5,One word - amazing!,"A group of 4 of us stayed at L'Heure Bleue Palais in February 2012. What an absolutely fabulous hotel. - We were upgraded to beautiful suites on arrival - The staff treated us like VIPs and were super helpful when the airline had lost my boyfriend's suitcase and arranged to collect it for us from Marrakech which was a 5 hour round trip for the driver. This was particularly important as the airline staff couldn't speak much English and we had to trust the driver with my boyfriend's passport - the breakfasts were amazing - we loved the roof top terrace and pool area with lovely lunches and little snacks brought out when we had drinks The spa was quite expensive but that is the only tiny complaint I have. I cannot recommend the hotel enough, it is gorgeous and we cannot wait to…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,A very happy holiday,"The purpose was to enjoy 7 days of relaxation in an interesting place. We had not been to Morocco before. From our perspective, this hotel proved to be ideal. The building is interesting (so glad we did not opt for a typical European hotel), without exception, all the staff were professional, helpful and friendly from the moment of arrival until our departure. By using the hotel's special 7 nights offer, we were able to combine cultural insights, exploratory trips and distinctive activities (incl camel riding, quad biking and a cookery workshop) all tailored to our specific requests on timing etc for which Naima merits special thanks. Essouira is small (and it is as it says a ""windy city"" but there is plenty to seek out if you wish.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 June 2012,5,Beautiful town with a hotel to match,"I have been severals time now and l'heure bleue is one of the best hotels i have been too, The service is excellent and the rooms are very well appointed. Essaouira is off the beaten track for UK visiters as there are no direct flights, but it is worth the 2-3 hour drive from Marrakech. During the summer it is warm, but the wind keeps the temperatures to a good level. Nearby there is also a world class golf course designed by Gary Player! Top hotel and top service, what more can you ask for!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,Loved our room and fireplace,"We had a suite and our friend had a connecting room -- just so convenient that way to go back and forth. The suite had a fireplace and since it was a cold windy nite in April, we asked the staff to make us a fire. They did, and left wood so we could keep it going. It was so wonderful to lie in bed and look at the fire -- the fireplace was in the middle of the room and could be viewed from either the sitting area or the bedroom. Just toasty. The bathroom was large with a decent shower separate from the tub. Two sinks. Nice robes and amenities plus large thick towels. We got room service for dinner and they were quick to deliver and take away when we were done. The weather was too chilly and windy to consider even going to pool on the roof, but it did look very nice from…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 March 2013,5,A wonderful few days!,"This is an absolutely wonderful hotel. In the Moroccan tradition, beautifully decorated and furnished with wonderful, caring staff. The suites are spacious and comfortable with very good lighting and stylish decor. There are fireplaces in every room should the wind cause the temperatures to drop too much. The restaurant offers some of the best food we have ever eaten. Very well positioned on the edge of the souk offering easy access to the seafront and the souk area.

The hotel breakfasts are very good. Dinner in the hotel not so good. The hotel is about 15 mins from the bustling fishing harbour. New fishing boats are built there as well. The flat sandy beach is massive, safe for kids, and is washed twice a day by the sea.. No donkey rides tho,' it's camels!!

They picked us up at the airport and we were welcomed to the hotel with mint tea and nibbles and sat in the beautiful courtyard while they took our bags up to the room. We were then shown to beautiful suite with the fireplace in the centre. Breakfast is fab here with loads of choice and the service is amazing. The rooftop area is fab, although the pool was chilly in February. We spent a couple of hours here every day chilling out. The beach is a short walk so you can do long walks on the beach every day and even the harbour is only a short 10-15 minute walk.

 January 2013,5,Beautiful Hotel,"My husband and i stayed at the hotel in January for 2 nights and wished it had been for longer. From the moment we arrived the staff could not have been more helpful or friendly, our room was beautiful (we were upgraded to a suite) and the whole place has a lovely feel to it , classy but not stuffy.The views from the roof top pool are gorgeous and the pool itself was very clean and large enough to have a proper swim. After i had a bit of an accident while horse riding the staff noticed my limp and arranged for me to be taken to the pharmacy and translated for me so that i got the right medication.

After a drive from Marrakech we were warmly greeted by the manager and relaxed with hot towels and snacks. After a short hotel tour we were shown our room. I was travelling with my father and the room was just what we required. Individually decorated and well appointed, the room was comfortable and spacious. The towels were particularly memorable.(A small point). All the staff we met were welcoming and the food was full of flavour. The chef even came to greet us one evening!

The room was fantastic, complete with a fire place which on one evening was very useful, a man with a stack of logs popped up within minutes of asking and a roaring fire was on the go.

We have visited Essaouira several times over the years and we really appreciated the pedestrian-only medina, so different from the motor-bike crazy alleys of Marrakech. This time there were bikes everywhere, beeping at pedestrians to get out of the way, blowing nasty fumes at customers in the cafes of the main square, and creating a noisy ruckus tearing up and down the medina at night. Everybody we spoke to is fed up with the bikes. One restaurant (Il Mare) had five of them revving outside its entrance and a whole tour group took one look and decided to eat somewhere else.

Much needed R&R time. It was the perfect place to unwind – and is truly an oasis within the hectic and congested medina. The service was great. We were upgraded to a suit on the second floor which provided us a nice size room we could read and relax in. The décor is very similar to a Raffles. The breakfast was great – and we enjoyed being able to sit each morning in the beautiful courtyard while enjoying the buffet and reading the newspaper (a few international papers available.)

 October 2012,4,Luxury in The Medina,Luxurious Hotel on the edge of the Medina. Very Expensive but beautiful place to stay. Reception staff welcoming and provided an excellent service. Rooftop terrace wonderful views and great location for breakfast. Service slow at breakfast and not the same high standard as other 5 star hotels I have stayed in. Crepes always arrived cold which was disappointing. I missed having a kettle in the room so that I could make tea or coffee when I wanted rather than having to wait for room service. I would stay again and recommend to family and friends.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2012,4,Some great features,We stayed here for five nights and for the most part I would say the hotel is great. The roof top pool and sun deck is probably as good as anything you could wish to find. The room was spacious and well maintained throughout our stay and breakfast served on the roof top is a joy. The staff were very friendly and helpful and created an atmosphere of peace and calm throughout. The general cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired for a 5 Star Hotel. The floors although swept daily need washing. I used a wet flannel to rub three or four areas of tiling and the dirt lifted with no effort at all. It is a shame because the hotel could be spectacular. Our biggest disappointment was the complete lack of menu translation available in the restaurant.

We ate in the hotel restaurant 2 nights out of 3 and the food was some of the best we experienced in Morocco. The service was very attentive, and the atmosphere of the restaurant very relaxing in the plush surroundings. We were disappointed that the wind kept out time sunbathing in the luxurious rooftop for much of our stay, although we were blessed with one full day laying in the sun and being spoiled by the fabulous staff.

The hotel staff were courteous and helpful and the Riad/French colonial style is wonderful, making it seem a true oasis of calm in the bustle of the medina. However standards did not meet our expectations for a 5 star hotel. The hotel has fresh air ventilation rather than air-conditioning, contrary to our understanding and that of many other reviewers. We stayed in room 24 where the airflow was woefully inadequate meaning a lost night's sleep as it was so stuffy and when we raised this with the hotel staff in the morning they said it was working properly.

From the welmonjng tea, through breakfast and dinner, we were treated to the ver best Morocco has to offer. Our suite was beautiful, but the great pleasure of this wonderful hotel is its beautful garden whether seen from the veranda or when dining under the lush foliage replete with a happy chorus of resident birds.

Its location is fine but the restaurant is very expensive. We didn't eat there but had room service and a chicken club sandwich, nothing out if the ordinary, was £20! Our first room was internal and on the first night the air conditioning was broken which led to a very hot and uncomgortable night. we informed them at breakfast and a fan was provided which just wasn't on given the price if this place.

So is the service: discreet but warm and friendly - especially from Mamadou and Lissame who were wonderful. My daughter brought her much beloved doll with her on the trip.

They say the wind can make you go insane - not if you're staying in L'Heure Bleue. This place is and oasis of colonial charm harking back to the days the empire. The Decor is very old school and the bar in particular reminded me of an old london gentleman's club. It's significantly cooler here than in Marrakech - but they light the fire for you to drink your £20 glass of Brandy by. Drinks and food are pretty pricey, but definitely worth it - BTE (Best Tagine Ever).

 April 2012,5,Favorite Hotel In Morocco,"We stayed at several five star hotels during a recent 10 day trip to Morocco but agreed that L'Heure Bleue was our favorite. Though the building was completely renovated during its recent conversion to a hotel, all of the spaces including rooms, lobby, courtyard, restaurant and bar have a very old world feel to them. There is a very authentic sense of historic grandeur without feeling fussy or overdone. The bar is incredibly chic and I regret not having spent more time there! We had dinner at the restaurant one night and it was good, not great, and also one of our most expensive meals in Morocco. It was worth it to spend an evening in the beautiful dining room but we had better seafood in some of the simple (and very inexpensive) local restaurants. Breakfast in the lush…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 April 2012,4,Fine food and excellent service,"We spent two nights at L'Heure Bleue and I would recommend it highly. It is just inside the old Medina, with a rooftop terrace with a pool, loungers and a very good lunchtime restaurant. Essaouira has excellent fish - you can watch it being unloaded from the large inshore fishing fleet and sold in the market, so you know that what you are eating is absolutely fresh. In the evenings dinner is served in a traditional Moroccan-style restaurant off the patio at ground floor level, and was exceptionally good - the sea bass with subtle ginger flavours was really memorable. On a chilly evening a log fire was burning, and in one corner a guy was playing a lute and singing - good ambience!

 March 2012,4,"Fantastic and charming place, despite noisy room..","Unfortunately we spent only one night at the Heure Bleue - a Relais & Chateaux Riad / Hotel within the Medina - and arrived in the early afternoon; we've been brought by Fathia, extremely kind and professional at the same time, to the internal area with palms and plants, and served with a fantastic Moroccan tea plus local cookies and fruits. The Manager, Mr Laustriat, introduced himself very kindly and has been, along with Fathia, always at our disposal for every need. The suite we've chosen was really very nice but was facing the external side of the hotel, extremely noisy due to public road works present all around the hotel (obviously out of the Hotel control) that started at 7 o'clock in the morning and of noisy people in the square during the night.

 January 2012,5,A Bit of Paradise,"If you have the chance to stay at L'Heure Bleu, TAKE IT! It is the most wonderful hotel in all of Morocco, as far as I am concerned. The staff is fabulous. The decor is tasteful. The rooms are so comfortable. Treat yourself to a service at the spa. I had a traditional hammam which was fabulous. The restaurant is magnificent. Leave plenty of time to enjoy the buffet breakfast. This might be a splurge for many budgets, but it is well worth it.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2011,5,Simply Fantastic,"We spent two nights here near the end of our trip to Morocco and fell in love with Essaouria and the hotel. From the moment we walked in the staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were smaller than other hotels, but were nicely decorated and impeccably maintained. The hotel was a 10 minute walk to the port and was easy to find when we needed to get back. The breakfast buffet had a great selection and the food was very tasty. Our kids took advantage of the snooker room and we all enjoyed watching ""Casablanca"" in the small cinema. The staff was very helpful and provided us with restaurant recommendations and allowed us to have a late checkout on our last day. The hotel is expensive, but worth it for us to have a very pleasant place to relax and be pampered.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2011,4,Wonderful respite after 9 days traveling around Morocco but expensive.,"We ended our nine days of travel in Morocco here after stays in Casablanca, Fes, Rabat, Imlil (High Atlas Mountains) and touring in Marrakech, Volubilis and Meknes. It is a beautiful hotel, a true riad, which our guide told us is defined by trees actually growing in an open courtyard. The courtyard is beautiful and a charming place to have drinks before dinner. At dusk the birds get active in the tops of the trees, singing and fluttering around which we found to be delightful. Staff is welcoming and very helpful. When my husband was under the weather on a Sunday morning a staff member accompanied me to the nearest open pharmacy and helped me buy the necessary over the counter meds we needed. The staff also was helpful in recommending restaurants and giving directions. My…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2011,4,Great place to relax,"I was not feeling well when we were staying at L'Heure Bleue and I've therefore mostly been relaxing inside the hotel instead of going into town. This hotel is perfect for that with it's rooftop terrace with daybeds, it's cosy bar and last but not least it's small cinema where you can see old classics like 'Casablanca'. Drinks and food are nice but expensive. The included breakfast is superb. Negative point: the room was way too warm for me to sleep and no airco or climate control working. I have to agree with some other review writers that that is strange for a 5 star - hotel in this price-range. But still, we'll come back soon!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 November 2011,4,Very good luxury hotel albeit too expensive,"The hotel is a typical old colonial palace from architecture to atmosphere. The service is excellent. The personnel is smiling and makes sure you are well taken care of. However if you compare with other luxury hotels in essaouira, the room charge is too expensive compared to what you can get elsewhere.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2011,3,Disappointed,Just returned from a 11 night trip to Morocco. After spending 4 nights in Marrakesh we headed for L'Heure Bleue. Upon arrival we were greeted by the Manager and given a much welcome drink with nibbles. First impressions were very favourable as the courtyard is very beautiful and comfortable. We were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite and were shown to our room (24). It was big enough although only had one chair in both the room and on the balcony which we thought was odd as it was obviously a room for two. The bathroom looked very nice initially until we tried to get in and out of the bath (there was no seperate shower) I am 5'8 and my husband is 6' but it was almost impossible to get in and out unaided and I don't know how someone smaller would have managed!

 August 2011,5,A fabulous place to chillax,We stayed here in August before going to Marrakech. The location was great: about 5 mins walk along a busy street to restaurants and 10 mins to the windy beach. Rooms are spotless and service is excellent. The OJ and pastries on arrival were great. The proprietor went out Of his way to shake the hands of all guests. I had a massage in the spa which was the best I've ever had! Sun terrace is relaxing but food is pricey. Much better value to pop along the street for a crepe or a falafel baguette. Service in the hotel was outstanding and the staff were lovely. Order a mint tea and mini pastries arrive too! A great place to relax and chill before or after Marrakech.,L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2011,5,"Lovely, stylish hotel in the medina","We stayed here for 8 nights this August. On arrival, the room( angle suite\) smelt very damp and we discovered a damp problem in the shower. This was immediately rectified. The hotel is beautiful. The central courtyar, where you eat breakfast( amazing) and are served evening drinks is beautiful. Full of tropical plants and fabulous lighting at night. The restaurant is ecellent. Definitely the best in Essaouira. Lunch is served on the tearrace on the roof. This is also very good and very comprehensive. One order is enough for two people especially after breakfast! The pool is unheated and freezing!

 July 2011,5,Gem of Essaouira: An Artifact from the Colonial Period,"After a 3 hour trip from Marrakesh, we arrived at the Essaouira medina. We had no idea what to expect. Once our driver parked the van, a very friendly man called Mamoudh welcomed us and accompanied us to the largest building in the medina, which was the hotel, built as a Riad. The inside decoration is beautiful with European, African and Arab touches. In the middle of the hotel is a beautiful garden. All the rooms face to the inside garden. The hotel has a very soothing atmosphere, especially when sitting in the garden. The restaurant was excellent. We ate there twice and both times had the catch of the day. During dinner there was live music performed by a outstanding lute player. The hotel also organized a tour of Essaouira with an excellent guide called Rachida.

The entire medina can be reached easily on foot. The rooms were the best we had in Morocco, and the food and service were excellent. Our only complaint was that the wind made swimming in the unheated roof-top pool an exercise in braving the cold, but this did not detract in any way from our enjoyment because Essaouira is not hot enough to make one crave a dip at the end of an afternoon of walking about.

Breakfast was excellent and the service and smiles from the staff made the stay. Spa and hammas very nice too - would certainly recommend.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 January 2011,5,Wonderful hotel and great staff!,"From the moment you walk into the hotel you can feel it is a special hotel. I had three nights here and really enjoyed my stay with them, the rooms are well designed and everything is of a high standard. Having a real fire at night in our room was a real treat! All the staff are a real asset to this hotel, both professional, friendly and accommodating. We had a really nice couples Hammam and would strongly recommend this, the Hammam is wonderfull and the treatment matched! I sincerely hope I can go back and I am sure I will. Is it worth the 2 – 3 hours drive from Marrakech – yes! Did I wish I had stayed anywhere else in Essaouira – not at all. Great location, great team and good professional management.

In contrast to the usual holidays we have everything was seamless from the meeter and greeter at the door to the little old cleaning ladies that did a fantastic job. Although this place could never be described as cheap in a million years you do get what you pay for and we believe we received the best. We organised our break through luxury-riads.com which was the cheapest by a long way for the hotel, they also arranged a cheap airport transfer for us which was welcome after our early morning flight. I would come here again, hell I’d live here if i could and coming from a fussy so and so like me that is indeed high praise.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 December 2010,5,Fantastic Experience,"We arrived at Heure Bleue at 2.0 am on Christmas morning. Pretty tired after a long journey from a snowy Heathrow! We were being waited for by a Manager and a Night Porter. They checked us in very efficiently and escorted us to out wonderful room. Normally all the rooms in Rhiad look into the central courtyard, however ours (room 24) was a corner room and had a balcony looking outside the building. We thought this was fantastic and that we'd got the best room in the place! Our view was South so we had sun on our balcony and looked across the Town straight over alovely paved square with lots going on and to see all the time.

Whoever trained them did a great job. The rooms were simply beautiful The towels were so pulsh, the bedding was stunning the pillows were so soft hated to wake up in the morning.

 December 2009,5,A dream in the nicest city of Morocco,"Essaouria is the most beautiful and romantic city in Morocco. L'Heure Bleue is absolutely the place to go for the following reasons : - typical Moroccan palace (Ryiad), with luxurious decoration - large bedrooms (difficult to find in Ryiads) with all what you need and more - delightful food (French and Moroccan fusion) - very charming staff - swimming pool and large sundesk on the roof with a view on the city - the New Year's Eve is fantastic (cocktail in the patio with at will Champagne and lovely appetizers + belly dancers and other attractions - fabulous diner - dancing party) - easy to find in Essaouira (very close to the bus station) - inside the Medina Expensive but that is worth it !",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 July 2010,3,Is it worth the journey?,"L'Heure Bleue is a pleasure to arrive at after 3 hours driving from somewhere like Marrakech, but is yet another one of those over-priced hotels that promise so much yet deliver so little. The hotel itself is delightful to look at and is the best place to stay in Essaouira - and the most expensive. It's debatable as to whether you think Essaouira is worth going to. The shopping is certainly lacking - and it's the most windy place I've ever been to, especially in July. Apparently it's always so - a fact that's kept quiet. We took a suite which cost 530 Euros a night. The suite was nicely decorated, but probably the smallest suite I've ever been in. No point changing suites, they're all the same size. But it was very comfortable, pleasant seating area, good internet connection -…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2010,3,Beautiful Hotel that misses on all of the important details....,"I stayed at L'Heaure Bleue last week for two nights with a friend and was, frankly, very disappointed in the quality of service and room relative to the cost. At 300 Euro per night, I expect to be treated much better. The worst was when we were told that, despite the fact that our room was very warm lacking any ventilation that turning on the AC would not be possible since ""people on higher floors are comfortable and we cannot turn on the air until June."" Basically, we were told too bad despite the fact that it led to uncomfortable nights with little sound rest. That said, the courtyard in the middle is beautiful and the hamman is nice but I would not stay here again. Jesse",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

There is an open courtyard with plants and balconies that open onto it. Breakfast buffett is served in the courtyard. The rooms are nice although a bit small.

 October 2009,5,Unforgettable Heure Bleue,"We went for a week in Essaouira to relax. Our travel agent had recommended us this Relais et Chateaux and we were not disappointed. First of all, some of the comments on Tripadvisor are related to the high price that you encounter in this hotel. For sure, if you compare with what you can get in some restaurants in town, you can be very surprised, but I would say that you don’t come to such a place to start counting your pennies…and the service that is displayed is worth what you are paying. Then, the hotel in itself is wonderful. We had chosen a suite and we recommend choosing either the Portuguese or English style suite.

 August 2007,3,Overwhelmingly expensive,"L'Heure Bleue was supposed to be the highlight of our Moroccan holiday. It was by far the most expensive hotel of the four we stayed in, and we were looking forward to the luxury. However, we felt disappointed - although the building is beautiful and clean, the room was so tiny as to be comic. The service, while attentive, was nothing like as good as we had received elsewhere, for much lower prices. The bar and restaurant prices were simply astronomical. Completely out of proportion. We didn't eat anything in the hotel and restricted ourselves to a cocktail once or twice while there - they were London hotel prices! In our view, this hotel was not a patch on Riad Dharia in Marrakech, which was cheaper and better.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 August 2009,5,Hotel perfection!!!!,"Heure Bleue - both the hotel and staff were truly first class. Their attention to detail was incredible, each evening the staff closed our shutters & curtains and lit scented candles to await our return to our room. The roof top terrace was an idyllic hide-away from the bustle below. Every detail was thought of - the manager of the hotel even gave us departure cards so we would not have any last minute form-filling at the airport. Whenever we entered the hotel we were greeted by someone asking us how our day was and when we ordered drinks we always received an appropriate and complimentary little savoury or sweet nibble to accompany them.

Although it looks and feels much older, this colonial style residence is less than five years old. The central courtyard is delightful and follows in the Muslim tradition of providing a clear shaft of daylight to the overhead sky. The bar is straight out of colonial Africa and you really expect to see Ernest Hemingway drinking (and smoking) in the corner of the lounge. Contrary to some reviews the staff are friendly and courteous and always willing to be of assistance.

This was our honeymoon and some of the reviews worried me. However I went with it and, although expensive for Morocco, it was an amazing stay. The basic rooms (c300 euro) are small but cute - however the air con was not working so we were moved. The next room wasnt working so after a stressful few conversations we were upgraded by the very competent manager (the assistant manager was not quite so good). The junior suite was fatanstic. 3 things made our stay; 1) The normal staff were unbelievably polite, smiley and helpful. The front desk even more so. This is not always the case in Africa. 2) The breakfast is all made on site and one of the best i have ever had 3) The pool terrace (only one…",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

Our room itself was lovely, but next to the linen room with a very squeaky door which the housekeeping staff were in and out of from early in the morning to well into the evening. A request to oil the hinges was ignored. The air-conditioning in the room didn't work, and after several requests someone was eventually sent to have a look and failed to mend it. Several more requests and we were provided with a fan - on the last day of our stay. There was also renovation work going on below our room, so we were subjected to banging and drilling noises throughout the three day stay.

We were tired so we order room service... the guy came to our room and had no hands available to knock the door, so he did it with the tray. we had to put the tray on the bed given that there was no desk, table or any other place to put it.

There is no doubt that the food in the dining room is excellent but that doesn't make a great hotel. The experience of checking in was the worst of the 4 hotels - we were told ""you're room is on the first floor"" and left to find our own way there. In all other hotels we had been shown to our room and the hotel facilities were explained. This summed up the service from the front desk throughout - perfunctory. Indeed, we received a message 23 hours after it had been delivered - it was a good job it wasn't that important.

Yes, you do get a little bit of noise, but you're in the medina for goodness sake ! The breakfasts were delicious, and lunch was great - we had it on the roof by the pool, where we lounged all day in the sun.

A walk through the main entrance takes you directly into the colourful, busy streets of the town. It is but a 10 minute walk to harbour and beach. Our room was functional, tidy and clean without being spectacular. The staff are helpful and polite but not over obtrusive. Breakfast was lovely and the eveing meal was really good (especially the sweet!) if a little pricey. Having spent 3 days in Marrakech prior to our stay at Essouira, it was a nice change.

Internet would not work in 2 of the rooms and the wireless connection was very slow in the public areas. There was a leak in one of the rooms so my daughters were moved to another, smaller room. My room was very noisy and especially so at 03.00 when the woman in the room above was walking around in high heels!. Worst of all is that all 4 of us suffered from food poisoning after eating at the hotel.

Beautifully restored building, within the walls of the old city. Very quiet at night. Food was great, a mixture between french and local style. Drinks are not cheap compared to Dutch price level. Lovely roof top pool with sea view. Staff does speak English, we did our best to communicate in French and this was appreciated.

 November 2006,1,Pretentious Establishment,"We had looked forward to staying at this hotel for a weekend during a two week holiday in Morocco, however we found the bedroom tiny and certainly not worth the rack rates.

An experience not to be repeated - I would recomend the Sofitel instead.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 October 2006,5,Thoroughly enjoyable stay,"Can't complain. Stayed 4 nights in October. They upgraded us from a junior suite to a suite upon arrival. Pool, rooftop terrace, location, breakfast, bar were all great. We didn't eat in the restaurant as there are more interesting places to eat in Essaouira than a hotel and having stayed for 3 nights in Marrakech I didn't want another tagine.

 September 2006,5,A Beautiful Retreat,"We spent four nights here, and found it simply lovely. The rooms, though small, were quite comfortable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The breakfasts were delicious - in fact, we were so full, we didn't eat lunch! Dinner in the restaurant was fantastic, and the ambiance was delightful. Most of our days were spent on the rooftop deck, lounging by the pool. The scene was serene, and the views picturesque. We also made it to the hammam, and what an experience that was! My skin has never been so soft. The two-hour long couple hammam was one of the highlights of our Moroccan honeymoon. We loved the location inside the medina, and had fun exploring Essaouira. L'heure Bleu was a delightful, relaxing getaway.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

We were in Morocco for almost two weeks - loved the country, the people and had no problems anywhere else. In fact, we loved Essaouira. Here's the story.... This is NOT a 4star hotel. Just isn't. The courtyard is beautiful, breakfast is great and the restuarant for dinner - is awesome. Our room was run down and smelled (musty, dirty). And the A/C didn't work - so it was very uncomfortable b/c you CAN'T OPEN THE WINDOWS. Even with the windows closed, there is a TON of noise from below.

 February 2006,4,Loved it,Ended up here after no reservation at the Sofitel Mogodor (See review of same date). Kuoni moved us here from the other hotel and what a difference. Although the room was small the whole experience was fantastic. We dined in the hotel once which was my wifes birthday and the meal was great. They even gave her a home made Birthday cake and sang happy birthday in Moroccan. The staff could not do enough for you - i could not even carry my drink from one place to another without a member of staff doing it for me.

 November 2005,3,"Beautiful property, great town, thoroughly mediocre service.","This is a simply beautiful hotel in a beautiful town. That's the good news. The bad news is that the service simply isn't up to scratch for the relatively premium price that the property asks for, especially in Essaouira. Not to say that it's particularly bad, but it isn't much better than a decent chain hotel (and pales in comparison to the experience you will have at a premium riad in Marrakech for the same price - think Riad Farnatchi, for example). I had a nice time here, and the room was very nice - but I can't help but think that my 300+ Euros/night would have been better spent at the Dar Mimosa, a bit out of town. Likely a 3.5/5, though the TripAdvisor system doesn't allow for half point ratings.",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

As other travellers, I consider that the rooms with fire place are much more pleasant as they offer a romantic atmosphere, youmay spend a full week overther without wondering what you can do...just look around and enjoy the spa, the billiard, the city, the beach and the atlas Mountains. Very good point also to consider this incredible vineyard called 'Val d'argan' at the entry of the city. The owner was 1st of all in 'Chateauneuf du Pape'!!! Very tasty!!!",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira

 June 2005,5,"For peace, seaside and gourmet addict: 2005 Conde Nast Hot list","Want to go somewhere different? Do just like we did discovering an incredible 5* Hotel/Palace mix of Arabic, Andalusia and colonial Architecture at the door of The Medina of Essaouira. Should you not remember: Orson Wells 1st and then Jimmy Hendrix helped us to discover this unique city. Why did we go there and should like to share this great experience: looking for romantic place to escape from crowded Marrakech with good food and full comfort... Here it is: L'Heure Bleue with its amazing pool on the rooftop terrace offering stunning view on the Old medina and the Seaside...Wonderful sunset, so romantic... We have booked a standard room but wished to have booked a Junior suite with fireplace and bath + shower + dvd...anyway very nice design and definitely comfortable... …",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
 May 2005,5,Great Hotel,"Fantastic luxurious place. The designs are amazing. Down to every detail. Only the pool on the roof can be windy at times and the rooms are quite small, but the whole feeling is great. The patio area is sooo nice. Service is excellent (which can be rare in Morocco).",L_Heure_Bleue_Palais,Essaouira
