 November 2022,4,"Authentic, very good staff","Wonderful people in this facility! The manager Idriss was very helpful in arranging tours, carry out, and any detail like special breakfast dishes. The staff were all friendly and attentive one of them helped us with an issue with a remote. There is a beautiful rooftop terrace which overlooks the harbor and new town we ordered carry out and Idriss arranged to have plates and utensils and wine glasses sent up. Idriss also arranged a WONDERFUL tour of old town the tour guide Mochine is the best! This is an authentic Moroccan space. The property is fairly close to the edge of old town in one of its alleys. There are traditional pictures, the tiles are ornate and the doorways are arched. The stairs do not have a hand railing so you’ll need to take your time going down.

 November 2022,5,A great few days,"We had a great stay here a week ago. Idris’ hospitality was amazing, he really went above and beyond to welcome us, provide advice and make our stay as nice as possible. The breakfast was great, location really good, it has a nice roof terrace with view of the city and the room was good value. Wi fi strong too so good if you want to work. Thanks very much !",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2022,5,I can't recommend enough,"This hotel was absolutely charming. We stayed in some expensive hotels on our trip and despite this hotel being cheaper, it was by far the best. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful. Beautiful view from the terrace. We went for our honey moon and upon hearing this they bought me a rose. It was such a lovely touch that no other hotel had bothered to do. We felt very safe and at home there. Anyone lucky enough to visit, we hope has as wonderful a time as we did.",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2019,5,Great value for money!,"This place is really cute, located perfectly in the medina area, rooms and bathrooms are small but perfectly clean! The rooftop terrace is amazing. It is a great value for money-place. Only bad thing was that we ordered a taxi for 6.15 AM for the train station, and it did not show up. We had not paid for it and went down the street and found another taxi, so everything was fine, but it was a little annoying. However, the place was really good!",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2018,1,Awful!,This is by far the worst place I've been. The place is gloomy and the room reeked of damp. You really don't want to spend any time in it. Very noisy at night. Minimum service : the room was never cleaned and the bedsheets and towels were never changed. No drinks or food except for breakfast that is not that good. The bathroom is really small and there's water everywhere after taking a shower. I don't recommend this place at all except maybe for its location that is the one and only good thing about this riad.,Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2018,5,Juice and cakes,"We spent two days in this Riad for my girlfriend’s birthday. The place is in the heart of Médina, is small and beautiful, the terrace is so so nice, and the staff is super amazing! We told him about the birthday and he helped me to find two delicious tiny chocolate cakes with a candle and some fruits juice (no bubbles for us!) to surprise my girlfriend. When we thought the night was already perfect, he knocked at our door with... a gift! What great people we met during our stay at this Riad, we highly recommend it for the position, for the comfort and for the people who work there. Thank you for making this a very special day.",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2017,3,"Lovely little hotel, good customer service - needs repairing & updating","As you walk in it's beautifully decorated. You're greeted with Moroccan Tea while you're checked in. The hall and stairway is beautiful too. Unfortunately, the card machine didn't work and so we had to walk to a cash machine. Bearing in mind we arrived in the evening- it wasn't a nice place to walk around as a newby to the area and being a woman with blonde hair (I clung to my boyfriend like glue). Our rooms were basic. There was a TV and cable, but only one plug socket (so you had to choose which one you wanted- pointless really)- when we asked for an multi socket extension cable the lovely guy didn't know what one was. We ended up finding one and he allowed us to use it for the night. The toilet and shower led much to be desired- the water pressure was terrible and the water…",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2017,4,"Simple Rooms, Fitting Character and Rooftop","The rooms are simple yes, but comfortable. The stairs are windy and steep but you're in the middle of the Medina after all. The staff was super friendly and even let us make a mess in the kitchen (which we cleaned up of course). The rooftop terrace is pleasant in the evenings but nothing more than that. I would recommend this place.",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2017,5,Escape from the busy streets,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful experience. One of, if not the most, enjoyable places that we have stayed during our two month backpacking trip. Comfy beds, ensuite with shower and consistent hot water, and a beautiful terrace. Breakfast was delicious and consisted of various sweet breads, jams, coffee, mint tea, and orange juice - not much protein but a good start to the day. The staff were incredibly friendly (spoke English) and helped us plan our stay in Tangier as well as suggestions for the rest of our time in Morocco. When we asked about washing they took our laundry and did it for free! The only con we noticed was that the lighting was quite dim in the room",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2017,3,Ok,"The hotel is really well situated in the Medina, especially if you come to tangier ville (as it's only a 10-15 minute walk). It's also really easy to find again once you have got lost wandering the medina. The staff are friendly and conversant in English which helped as my French is better than my Arabic... but not by much. Their card machine wasn't working when I came to pay and they happily accepted euros instead as I'd spent the last of my dihrams. (I also got a little bit of a discount in doing so). Unfortunately there were some drawbacks. The internet didn't work in our room (we were in room 7 at the top and, as others have said, it is the best room as it has views and is away from the bustle of the city below). We aren't addicted to the internet but it helps when…",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2017,5,Much better than we anticipated,"Dar Bargach is a great value for money and it's actually better than it looks in the photos. We stayed in the top floor room and we had the rooftop all to ourselves. Amazing view, delicious breakfast and in walking distance to Kasbah, Grand Socco etc. Also, the girl than runs the place (so sorry we forgot her name) is absolutely helpful - she arranged us a taxi transfer to the bus station and gave us great tips about Tangier. Highly recommended.",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 July 2016,1,Horrible and dirty rooms,"Horrible and dirty rooms, incovinient place. The staff was very helpful and gentle. The stairs were very narrow.

 August 2016,1,Awful,"We had asked for a room on the ground or first floor because of health problems and were given a room on second (top floor) which you couldn't swing any self respecting cat in - added to this the stairs were incredibility steep. Bathroom had broken shower mounting and the tap in basin didn't appear to be anchored, electrical plug was hanging from the wall and was dangerous, worse thought was the air con which didn't work. We asked to be moved and this was done - air con worked but manager did not leave the air con control and then it was freezing used both bankets so we wouldn't freeze.

My phone was both out of charge [power] and I couldn't put credit on it without a network. Internet cafes were all closed and a map of Tangiers was nowhere to be found. I had to make a fund transfer to my Visa which was impossible without a network WiFi or 3G , but I walked towards the west and the Medina or Casbah where nobody would help me find the Hotel.

 September 2014,4,A good stay at Dar Bargach,Dar Bargach is located in the medina. The place had many stairs. + Good hostel. + Good location. + Good bed. + Good bathroom. + Good breakfast. + Friendly staff. - Only some of the staff spoke English. The older man at the reception was very poor to English.

 October 2014,3,Follow these simple steps and you'll have a lovely stay,"First, make sure that the remote controls to operate the air conditioning units are not under LOCK AND KEY when you arrive (I decided to stay explicitly because the website indicated they had been installed). Then, be sure that everything in your room works before you accept it: toilet, water, etc. Then, maybe consider using your own pillow case cuz the linens are really thin. Voila. Sadly, I moved to no less than THREE ROOMS and had to deal with a very embarrassing toilet situation cuz I didn't have this good advice. The guy who works here, Abdelilah, is obviously a nice guy dealing with an occasionally crappy (ahem) set up. Honestly tho, the place would be borderline great for the price if not for the snafus. But you do get what you pay for I guess!",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2014,3,"Price/location are good, but there are flaws","Other reviewers are right on: The price is right and the staff is friendly, but the beds are hard and the rooms are stuffy. We didn't mind staying here for a night, though. The place has a cool authentic feel to it, and the views from the terrace are beautiful. Our room had one small window to the open-air staircase in the center of the hostel, and we got a bit of a breeze when it was open. The location is good, on the edge of the medina, though. Other reviewers have complained about the noise, but we didn't notice that. I'm sure it depends on other guests and whether it's a party night. The lighting in our room was dim, which other reviewers also noted. The WiFi was a bit spotty but worked quite well at night and in the morning.

 August 2014,3,You really do get what you pay for,"Its cheap and its well located thats about it. If you are looking for somewhere to crash on a low budget this place will work for you. The rooms are so so so hot it is almost impossible to sleep and i agree with other reviews it is extremely noisy at night and noisy from the staff. There is limit comfort to the room and the wash room is not the greatest. On the first night we tried to order food through them and they told us that it was not available. They offered to walk us to a nearby restaurant but we were taken on tour of the medina and taken into lots of different shops - long story short dont except help in the form of a guide they are only after money, it is not them being friendly.

 June 2014,4,Everything you need on the edge of the medina,"This was our first experience of accommodation in Morocco, and we couldn't really say a bad thing about it. The location is ideal, out on the edge of the medina but within minutes walking distance to all of the main areas. We arrived to a warm, homely welcome with plenty of information, maps and recommendations. The beds are a little hard, but we seemed to sleep just fine. Other guests have commented on the noise, but we feel this is fairly common throughout Morocco - we stayed in room number 7 at the top of the building (easily the best room) and did not really hear too much during the night. The breakfast is simple but the coffee is good. Here is how you find the place (it is not hard despite testimony to the contrary): Step one - ask your cab driver how much it will cost to…",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 March 2014,5,Great value & location,"We really appreciated our stay at Dar Bargach. The receptionist Catty (I hope I spelt it right) was helpful and gave us good advice about hustlers, where to eat, what to do etc. If coming in from the port I recommend taking a blue petit taxi and asking for Dar Bargach near hotel continental. Should not cost more than 15D as it is 2/3mins away from the port. Room was lovely and clean, shower was hot and breakfast was delicious. Only complaint would be the light in our room was very dim and I found it hard to read. Overall very enjoyable stay!",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2014,4,Perfect Start to the New Year,"I stayed on New Years Eve and seriously chilled out with Mohammed and another member of the staff all night in the guest lounge. They taught me Arabic and talked about cultural differences in gender. The receptionist was also very sweet. At the end of our trip we came back through Tangiers and went straight to Dar Bargach but it was all booked up, so the receptionist found us a room at the bed and breakfast next door for the same price. The place is just when you walk into the medina, its easy to find, its cozy and you meet nice people. The breakfast was nice and everything was clean. I woke up to a new day in a new year to friendly people and mint tea in a new country. deserves great reviews.",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2013,4,Good budget option,"I had a good stay at Dar Bargach. The hosts were friendly, the room was clean and had its own bathroom, breakfast was included, and the wifi on the first floor was okay. The place is a little hard to find. The trick is to walk up th hill towards Hotel Continental and keep an eye out on your left for signage to Dar Bargach. Dar Bargach's location makes it a convenient choice for those arriving by ferry. I arrived from the train station, which is 4km away in the ville nouvelle (in my infinite wisdom, I walked). All the same, it's a convenient start point for those who want to explore Tangier's medina and surrounds.",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2013,5,Dar Bargach - Highly recommended,"We had an amazing seven nights stay at Dar Bargach. The location of the hostel right within the Medina is fantastic and the staff are extremely helpful, discrete and friendly. The rooms are small, but clean and comfortable with windows facing the court yard. Breakfast served in Moroccan style, was tasty and filling. The roof terrace, where we spend many happy afternoons and evenings, offers amazing views over the Medina and Tangier.

We highly recommend a stay here!",Dar_Bargach-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Dar_Bargach,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2013,4,Idyllic Moroccan guesthouse,"If you're looking for a typical Moroccan style guesthouse, this is it! Right in the middle of medina, the ancient section of Tanger. Though at night it is incredibly hard to find, there is no street lighting and the medina is a maze so I would not advise you to arrive too late at night. Though there will probably always be a guide to bring you there (for a small fee of course). The rooms are great and the beds are clean, so is the shower and bathroom. The service isn't amazing, they slightly overcharged compared to the price that was state on the Internet. The WiFi will barely work in the rooms, partially because of the the thick stone walls.

 July 2013,1,Stolen items!,"We were on our first trip in Morocco and we wanted to really have the chance to experience the charm as well as the fascinating culture. As a young couple, we are on a limited budget so we chose to go to Dar Bargach because of their price and other reviews on TripAdvisor... What a mistake we made. The gravest qualm we had was the theft from our luggage by a member (yes, they allow multiple staff members into rooms). Upon arrival, we were told that we arrived too early (10:00am) and to 'walk around' until our time to check-in at noon. This was not very hospitable but that was fine and we left.

The rooms are small but cosy and very clean, so are the bathrooms. They have a very nice terasse from which you can overlook Tangier. The breakfast was richer than the typical Moroccan (hotel) breakfast, with some small pasteries, cake, bread, white cheese, honey, olive oil and olives (and tea and coffee, of course). The staff is exceptionally friendly and discreet, we were made to feel at home. We enjoyed our stay at the Dar Bargach. A very good budget option, I would go there again.
