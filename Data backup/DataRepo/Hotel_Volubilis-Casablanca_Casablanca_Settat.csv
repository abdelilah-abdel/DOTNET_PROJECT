 October 2019,2,Sort of OK,"If you really want the lowest cost place to stay, maybe you could do it. It is a safe place, an extremely friendly staff, close to the center of town and reasonably clean. However, you might consider this: The hot water did work in my room. Too much trouble to change rooms or hotels after checking in. Skip the hotel breakfast. Not worth the money. Didn’t get sick on the food. Have fun in Casablanca.",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,hotelName,city
 January 2018,3,Enjoy from outside!,"Hotel Volubilis is one of the beautiful examples of Casablanca’s Art Deco legacy. Unfortunately, hotel itself is really worn out and is waiting for significant financial injection. Enjoy the exterior and don’t even think about staying here.",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2017,2,dont go there,"although the bell hope was a nice guy and helpful, no one spoke any English. they simply could not communicate with you. not helpful staff at all. the room was terrible. something out of the 1950s. no way a 3 star. 1 star at best.",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,1,Worn down and dangerous.,"The hotel is in terrible condition and in immediate need of attention. First, the room smelled like and old bar, cigarette smoke. Second, we had a bird inside our room. We managed to let the bird out through our window. Third, a big hole, made by corrosion at the bathtub (see picture). Fourth, two lamps were missing. One in the ceiling and one above the mirror. The one above the mirror had live wires ""out in the open"". Fifth, the AC didn't work. It was a mobile unit, however, the flexible exhaust hose was removed and fitted as a water lock to the toilet. Staff didn't speak English.",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,1,Go away,Very bad and terrible rooms Poor rooms and high prices You can find a very good hotels with the same price beside it friendly staff rooms are small and dirty noisy air condition not work overall go away,Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,3,A OK hotel - but the staff!!,A well placed hotel - and value for maney Small rooms - but due to the price OK Charming lobby at Transatlantic Breakfast the same as Transatlantice But the receptionist at Volubilis was extreamly unpolight and I found lazzy ! If it was not for the receptionist the hotel got a higher score,Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2014,1,Dont go to this hotel...it is a fraud.,"We showed up with a reservation made through hostelbookers.com. The rude girl in the reception said there was no reservation and that it was not her business to find out what had happenned. Eventhough we showed our confirmation of the reservation and the payment of the booking fee, she said she had no contact in hostelbookers and could do nothing. After discussing for a long time with another man in the reception (who of course also treated us like we were crap). we saw he had our reservation printed and written by hand ""not accepted"", but they could never explain why. They said to us they could offer another room, a more expensive one, but wouldn´t take what we had paid before. We left to another hotel after loosing our time and money, and called hostelbookers, who then told us…",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2013,1,Stay away,"I was uncomfortable the entire time I was there. Unclean rooms, I have no clue if those sheets were even washed. I didn't use the towels the Hotel provided. The room had shampoo, the bottle was half empty so someone topped it off with water, very ghetto. The hotel is connected to a man's bar, so strange men are constantly coming in and out. Smelly, musty, stay away. The staff was nice though, they kept our bags after checkout while we set up our departure. But that's about it. Even for free, I would NEVER stay here again.",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2012,1,Don't Stay Here,"This hotel charged 45 euros for one night in a double room, we were initially told this would be 40 euros and they even tried to charge us 50. Exceptionally damp bedding, could not see through the window or open it as it was boarded up on the outside. Shower curtain didn't reach the top of the bath so consequently the entire bathroom floor - bare concrete - was soaked, towel rail fell off the wall. Very loud night club downstairs that went on throughout the night. Lift only worked when it felt like it. The breakfast hall - which is actually shared with the more up-market Transatlantique - looked like a horror film, dirty, untidy and un-cared for. Breakfast was horrible - fluorescent slices of meat, blobs of old butter floating in water and stale pastries. The architecture…",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2011,4,Support Art Deco hotels before they disappear.,"If you love architecture, Hotel Volubilis and its sister Hotel Transatlantique next door are for you. Hotel Volubilis is cheaper and a step down in quality. Breakfast is served in the dining room of Hotel Transatlantique. The bathroom sink leaked, but otherwise, my room was clean. The furniture is old. I always cringe when I read that a hotel has been 'renovated'. It usually means the charm has been erased and replaced with generic blandness. I am a frequent traveller who prefers old. I especially liked watching the sunrise over Casablanca from my 1919 balcony. If you need quiet, use earplugs. This hotel is downtown, not in a sleepy suburb. Plenty of sidewalk coffee cafes inhabit the neighborhood surrounding this classic Casablanca hotel.",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2010,1,"Unsafe,rude, extremely dirty,poor condition, worst hotel ever.Please do not stay.","The hotel was really bad. The staff was helpful at first but was rude later on. The room was extremely dirty. We had to change the room as soon as we went inside our room.The new room was also very dirty. The bathrooms was dirty. There was a horrible smell in the bathroom.We both couldn't even take a shower the next day because it was so dirty. The room was not even cleaned the next day. When asked they told me we that they will clean it the next day.The hot water would not work. Had to keep the tap on for around 20 mins to get some hot water. Our friend who was in another room actually slipped on the bathroom at cut his arm.The staff was really unfriendly.The hotel does not even have a first aid kit.When we asked for help, instead of helping we were told to go to the pharmacy…",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2010,4,"Central, clean, safe and welcoming","I stayed here for two nights and felt that it was good value for money in an excellent location and that my room was safe and secure. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout. The rooms are relatively small and basic but they are light and very clean, with nice balconies to sit out on. Breakfast is in the linked Transatlantic Hotel, giving you a chance to enjoy its ""bygone era"" granduer. A very good budget option all in all.",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2009,1,"Unsafe, Rude, and in Poor Condition...But Lovely Architecture!","Stayed for 2 nites. Fighting outside lobby/bar nightly. Rooms small, broken art and furniture,door barely locked and easily picked by novice. Airconditioning constantly leaking in middle of room, no warm water on 2nd day. No wi-fi as advertised. Restaraunt with nice decor but poor menu and ultra-minimal biscuit,coffee, jelly and a couple slices of lunch meat. Staff helpful at first, but very pushy and even rude for tips later....even after tipping quite well! Much more.... but generally all negative. Good news is it was cheapest and nice local architecture/art on 1st floor only. Not worth the savings.....especially when personal safety involved. Please dont take the kids!",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2009,3,"Nice folks, REALLY noisy","THe exterior of this hotel is a birthday cake of art deco marvelousness, and the tiny lobby has been tastefully redone as well. the staff could not have been any nicer and really very helpful. on the downside, the rooms while recently redone, were done so on a very small budget and it shows. musty and damp. and the noise from the disco down the street kept me awake until 4-5 am the two weeknights i was there.",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2009,2,"rooms need refurbishment, but the staff is very friendly","We were on a low budget and only for 1 night only - and for that, the hotel was ok. If you stay longer I would not recommend it. Location is quite good. Public area's are beautifully done in marrocan architecture. Breakfast feeds you, but that is far from european standards. At nights it gets very noice as a night club is in the same building. Staff is very friendly and helpful! The rooms need to be refurbished expecially the waterpipes...every time you flush the toilet or use water strange noises appear which do not sound too healthy. Bottom line: for one night ok and staff makes up for a lot!",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2009,3,Overpriced!,"I chose this hotel as a medium priced hotel, but soon realized that it was way overpriced for the quality of the services. I went in low season and still had to pay 350dhs for a single room. The hotel rooms are musty, very noisy as there is a nightclub located in the same block. It advertises wireless, which it does not have; there is a computer for 20-30guests with a slow internet connection. When cleaning the rooms, the staff will leave all the rooms on the same floor open and go from one to the other, without paying much attention to who comes in and out: thus, do not leave anything valuable in your room. The only high point is the fact that the Volubilis is joined on the ground floor with a nicer hotel: Hotel Transatlantique. As a consequence, one can enjoy the restaurant…",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2008,4,"Convenient, good value","Found hotel in guide book - pretty cheap, decent location, clean Was next to a nightclub which seemed pretty noisy, but didn't actually keep us awake. Internet access - free for half and hour - was pretty useful Grand taxis are reasonably easy to get round the corner to the left; petit taxis on the main road round the corner to the right also easy to get About 10-15 mins walk from Place Mohammed V; 10-15 min taxi ride to beach",Hotel_Volubilis-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Volubilis,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
