 November 2021,1,Do not trust pictures‚Ä¶,"Lack of hygiene‚Ä¶ Bedclothes are not regularly changed, bathroom was not clean, shower floods every time (I thought it was me throwing water out but it wasn‚Äôt) excellent location in Casablanca, close to most place of interest. Breakfast cost 3‚Ç¨ and it‚Äôs supposed to be served from 8:00 but the concierge was sleeping until 8:30 in the reception‚Äôs couch‚Ä¶. After he woke up and was asked about breakfast told me to wait for him to buy it in the street and bring it into the hotel‚Ä¶. üòÄ Of course I told him not to do it! If you need a place just to sleep one night and do not have booked a better option it‚Äôs ok but take in consideration that it is not a clean place at all!",Point_du_Jour-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,hotelName,city

It looks like a ‚ÄúHole-in-the-wall‚Äù from the outside, and even when first entering the lobby. But the rooms are spacious, the beds are super-comfortable, the staff is warm and friendly, and the breakfast is more than adequate. They people at the counter are anxious to help you find your way to wherever you want to go. For the money, you cant go wrong.

This hotel is walking distance to the Place de la liberation with all the cafes and restaurants, and of course the old Medina ( highly recommended) , but if you're not afraid of walking a bit further,like an extra 15 minutes I also recommend in the morning the fishing port with the fish market and the fishing boats. lots of great photos to take there.",Point_du_Jour-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Point_du_Jour,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2018,4,"2 star hotel, 5 star service","This hotel epitomises the phrase 'cheap and cheerful.' But it's really all about the great staff. Given it's only 2 stars, this isn't a hotel for fine linens and silver service. Or strong water pressure, for that matter. But for a short stay, it's a great place to get your bearings.

They were also very helpful in pointing out places to visit and providing directions or advice on how to get there.

 March 2018,5,This is the best choice,"I'm an expat currently working in Morocco. Even there are some great 5 star hotels in Casablanca, when it comes to midrange hotel which is appropriate both for business and leisure it's very difficult to find a good one (this happens in other cities in Morocco, most of budget hotels are old and not well maintained). So this hotel is the best choice for travelers who don't need a luxury hotel but need good service and cleanliness to rest. Why I recommend this hotel: Casa port station is walking distance. 1 min walk from tramway station. Located in central area. Quiet and safe area (in weekend bars and restaurants around make some noise but till 0 a.m.) Cleanliness. Shower works well. Beds are comfortable. Decor and lighting are simple and chic. Good amenities for this price. ‚Ä¶",Point_du_Jour-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Point_du_Jour,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
