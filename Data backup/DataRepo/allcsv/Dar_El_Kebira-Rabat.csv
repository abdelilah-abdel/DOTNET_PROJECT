 January 2023,5,Lovely Riad in a great location,"This was a lovely Riad in a great spot. Although we had a medical emergency the staff were able to assist us in dealing with it. The facilities were great, but don't expect a five star European style hotel. It is totally Moroccan. The terrace breakfasts are not to be missed.",hotelName,city
 June 2022,5,Charming,"Dar El Kebira provided my family (a party of 7 in 4 rooms) a lovely experience. The staff was exceptionally professional and helpful, breakfast on the rooftop was delicious, and the rooms were cozy, clean, and charming. The location was ideal - in a very quiet, narrow street but just steps away from the Medina. We did not want to leave this beautiful place.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2022,5,Morocco trip,"Very nice Riad, nicely decorated and comfortable. Warm and welcoming staff. Breakfast was very nice. Very nice views from the terrace, beautifully decorated courtyard. Located across from the Kasbah. We recommend this riad.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2023,5,Great Service at Sofitel Rabat,"I am writing to thank you for a great stay at Sofitel Rabat. I also write to commend Najat in the housekeeping department for the kindness, care, warmth, and attention that she gave to us. We have three small children, and Najat provided so much help to us during our stay.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2022,5,"The Best Riad, service/people and perfect location 10/10 !!","We stayed here at the end of Nov for a few nights, honestly the riad was beautiful from the moment you walk in, absolutely stunning not only was it incredible architecture it was spotless clean ! Even better than pictures. the atmosphere and vibe was 10/10. Location was spot on you are in the heart of old Medina with souks and markets surrounding you with the Kasbah and sea 5mins walk.

 November 2022,4,Step back in time staying in the heart of the Medina,Our first three nights in Morocco and we were immediately immersed in Moroccan hospitality! The Dar aka the hotel was built in the 15th c. and has been upgraded about two decades ago. The rooms are quirky but well decorated. The rooftop lounge is amazing and breakfast is served there. You can see all of the old city from the rooftop and hear the calls to prayer from the minarets. We met interesting travelers from Canada also staying there. Shout out to Hamid who wears many shoes working at the Dar and his smile never leaves his face- he is amazing!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2022,5,Nice introduction to Morocco,"Following our flight from the US to Casablanca arriving early in the morning, we had an opportunity to visit the Hassan II Mosque. Don't miss it If possible! It is an unbelievable From there we went on to Rabat to begin our tour of Morocco beginning with a stay in this wonderful Dar (lacks a fountain and garden but otherwise is similar to a Riad except it is smaller). Our room was on the first floor overlooking the courtyard. It was clean and had a bathroom with a bathtub and shower (getting out of the bathtub was an adventure since it abruptly sloped in the middle). The room was very clean and had a very comfortable, firm king bed. We had our evening meal on the terrace overlooking the courtyard below. The terrace had a nice view of the surrounding area of the medina.‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2022,5,Beautiful and comfortable gem in Rabat,"This classic Moroccan ""Dar"" is a beautiful gem in Rabat Medina. We stayed one most comfortable night and we are very sorry that our plan does not allow more. The decor is eclectic and the atmosphere is second to none. We recommend this hotel for its beauty, its comfort and for the kind hospitality we received.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2022,5,Beautiful and true Moroccan,"A dar is a house, in this case accepting visitors. A riad is a home with a central garden. This is our preference, with ultimate Moroccan flavor and ambience. To access (in the medina) we travelled in a maze of narrow alleys, trusting our guide, and were blown away when the barely perceptible door was opened. Beautiful staff, gardens, and food, with Moroccan welcome tea. Part of the experience is talking with the other international guests. (Some French is helpful for the locals).",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2022,5,Riad in Rabat,This Riad is very nice and Soufiane his an awesome host. I recommend this experience. This place was very well located in the Medina and has a very traditionnal feel. It is not your typical western hotel and is worth seeing.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2022,5,Review,We truly enjoyed our stay at Riad Dar El Kebira. The Riad is in beautiful condition and the staff was very helpful and kind. Our bags did not arrive in time and they tried to help us locate them multiple times. The rooms were very comfortable as well. The breakfast was good although the dinner was a bit expensive. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay and highly recommend It.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2022,5,Peaceful Riad‚Ä¶,"Truly Amazing Riad, very comfortable, peaceful and tranquil. The team are really helpful and always go over and above! Very pleasant stay, highly recommended a visit on your tour of Morocco üá≤üá¶ Enjoy üòâ",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2022,5,Great care shown by staff,We arrived very hot and frazzled to this lovely Riad. We were greeted with mint tea in a cool and tranquil courtyard. Our room was very comfortable and we were upgraded to an even larger room (both with aircon). We were very well looked after and enjoyed the breakfast on the rooftop and the sound of the call to prayer. We also enjoyed dinner in the Riad one night - try the harira. Great location too. The Riad kindly arranged a driver and an official guide of Rabat. I would happily stay here again and would highly recommend it. Our particular thanks to Hamid who took such good care of us.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2022,5,Great riad,Great experience beautiful riad. Staff was very helpful. Located in a quiet part of the Medina close to the seaside. Breakfast was good. Room was beautifully decorated. Dinner is available but we prefered to eat out,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2022,5,The best riad in Rabat,"I loved everything about it, the rooms are beautiful and clean, the staff is very welcoming, kind and respectful, the rooftop has an amazing view on rabat which gives you a glimpse on the beautiful city.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

 October 2019,5,Fantastic Riad!,"We decided to go to Rabat for a short break and this Riad looked perfect. It was! The staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough to help us. Fantastic breakfast served every morning by Youness and Hamid was fantastic! He helped us with all sorts of everything, nothing was too much bother. The Riad is in a great location, the rooms are all well equipped and overall atmosphere of the place is one of tranquility. Can' recommend this place enough. Thanks you to all the staff for making our stay such a lovely one.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2020,5,Very pleasant stay,Very nicely decorated and appreciated the bottled water given to us daily. Room was quiet and beds were comfortable. I don't think the heating/air con was working but this wasn't a problem. The hotel is well located as it's in the medina and it's very quiet at night. We were offered an upgrade to a bigger room but this was a queen bed and we wanted a twin room. Breakfast was delicious with various breads and condiments/jams and fresh orange juice (as well as other things) We didn't use the hammam but had a look at it. It looks small but quite decently priced.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2020,5,A Good Riad in Rabat Medina,"We enjoy staying this riad. The host provides good services including good breakfast and good dinner. The riad is in very good condition, well decorated. The location is great, easy to walk to scenic area. Highly recommend for tourists.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2019,2,Poor air conditioning can ruin the stay,"The people at this Riad were very nice. The breakfast was good and the hamman was excellent. We visited in September and the weather was still quite warm throughout the night. We had two rooms and, unfortunately, the air conditioning in my room was not working. I didnt want to leave my window open at night as there was an empty rooftop to another building within armsreach to my room. There also was a small clustering of very tiny ants in the room. The person at the desk told me they had no other rooms to switch me to making it quite uncomfortable to get a good night's sleep. We had previously booked for two nights but switched to another riad for the second night since they could not fix the air conditioning. Unfortunately, the owner charged me for the second night even‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2019,5,Charming Riad in the medina,"We stayed at this Riad in the December holiday season and had an amazing experience. Right from meeting us at the curb to get out luggage and throughout the entire stay, the staff was friendly, attentive and courteous. The riad was charming and located right in the medina, which made it easy to shop around the souq. The room was large and the shower was perfect! Overall, great experience!!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2019,5,Great Riad/Hotel if you are passing through Rabat,"We stayed here in December and enjoyed it! The staff was incredibly nice and accommodating. We interacted with Younnes the most. The location is great and close to the Medina. We only stayed one night, but would 100% recommend!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2019,5,Secret Rabat,"Tucked inside the busy streets of the Rabat medina is the wonderful Riad. Rooms were comfortable, clean, toiletries plentiful, breakfast abundant and staff exceptional. Samhae the evening manager took care of us as if we were royalty. Samhae perfectly arranged for a private guide/driver to visit Meknes and Volubilus, two locations well worth the day. Moreover, see arranged for transportation from the airport to the Riad. Samhae was so lovely and after a full day of touring it was a delight to see her smiling face as we returned to the road. Definite keeper.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2019,4,A hidden nice place,"The location of this Dar is really good, as you are walking distance from the Kasbah and the souks, inside the medina. The room was OK, the dining room and terrace are nicer. Good breakfast, not all the staff speaks english.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2019,4,A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE,"We had no idea about Riad and thus stayed here during a trip to Rabat in end May 2019. We asked the hotel for a cab to pick us up at the airport and it was waiting for us when we arrived. Once we got down from the taxi, they picked up our luggage and showed us the way from the car park, which was 5 mins walking through old town, which is called Medina. It‚Äôs good to note that the hotel is actually located in the Medina but within 5 mins walking from the main road. It has different types of rooms but we got a room with narrow width. The length was ok but practically no more than 10‚Äù walking space on both sides of bed. Therefore it was difficult to get up and down. All the windows of the room were opening inside inner courtyard which meant no noise. The weather was pleasant,‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2019,5,"Excellent Location, Delightful Hotel",We loved our stay at this Riad in the hart of the Rabat Medina. Lovely staff and amazing breakfast on the roof top. Would stay here again for sure. We also enjoyed the onsite Hammam. This was a wonderful part of our stay in Morocco.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2019,1,Stolen money,"I wasn't planning on leaving a bad review, considering most of the staff was kind at the riad and overall I had a pleasant experience. Ahmed was great and did a great job serving breakfast and the dinner was delicious (if not a bit pricey) However, the second day we asked for our room to be changed and a staff member assured us our stuff would be moved. We had every inclination to trust our staff would be taken care, anyways before I left I counted all my dollars in front of my husband, and on the way back I recounted and $40 dollars were missing. It felt horrible but we were understanding and told the receptionist and said we would not report it. What angered me, was just as I was leaving she asked me again if I was sure. It made me feel as if I had lied, and to make matters‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2019,4,Great start to our Moroccan holiday,"We arrived at the riad tired after our long trip from Melbourne, Australia to be greeted by friendly and happy staff who sat us down before they gave us some mint tea and Moroccan cookies/pastries to have while our tour driver organised our check in at the front desk. The interior of the riad was beautiful, stunning, very clean and spotless, staff were very helpful when it came to booking our dinner time and would like to go back again for a longer stay. Dinner was delicious starting with their bread, olives, pickled vegetables, cucumber, beef tagine and veal tagine. The Moroccan wine was very nice too!! We were booked into the Agdal room for our overnight stay but knowing now that it was a small room, we would book a bigger room next time. Ahmed who looked after us during our‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2019,5,Magical Moroccan experience,"From the time we arrived after a long travel day, to 4 days after we left. The friendly and extremely efficient staff made us feel at home. All and all an excellent introduction to Morocco ! I would recommend this Riad to anyone and everyone!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2019,4,Lovely riad with welcoming staff,"A beautiful little riad for our first night in Morocco, tucked away behind a door in an alleyway. Our room was small but great in a traditional Morrocan style - we loved it. We had no problems with noise from outside despite our room being alongside an alley. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because the evening meal was sadly not great. The chicken in the tagine was so hard I couldn't chew it, and my husband's vegetable tagine was bland and tasteless. We have since eaten the same dishes elsewhere which were tender and flavoursome. Maybe we were unlucky and it was the cook's night off?? Breakfast however was wonderful - freshly cooked to order, lots of it and served by lovely staff on the terrace. üòä",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2019,3,Seems minimal for the price,"Our room was on the second floor. In the evening we heard every conversation in the courtyard with our windows (note the ONLY windows and door were facing an interior courtyard) and door closed. At 6 a.m. the staff setting up for breakfast woke us as they moved tables and chairs directly above our room. The first room they showed us was so small the only place to put a suitcase was on the bed, no place to even leave a few clothes outside the suitcase. Finding a place to store the suitcase was not possible. Make sure you get one of the larger rooms.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2019,5,Magical Riad in Rabat,My husband and I started a trip of a lifetime to Morocco to celebrate our 25th Anniversary. We began in Rabat thanks to the wonderful travel assistance of Experience Morocco - highly recommend this tour agent. The first night at this romantic riad was magical. Breakfast on the roof the next morning was perfect. Highly recommend staying here. Rabat is a gem.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2019,5,Relax in Rabat,"Riad Dar El Kebira. Well done. A really well located riad that is comfortable, relaxing and friendly. The peaceful interior is a haven from the bustle of the souks and provides the perfect counterpoint in this important Moroccan city. The staff are terrific, breakfasts on the balcony something to look forward to each morning and the mint tea and pastries always a winner any time of the day. Thanks for the numerous little things that add up to a great stay.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2019,4,Pleasant Stay and value if under $120US,"Tucked away in the labyrinth of roads that make up the old Medina, this is a pleasant retreat. Rooms are very small unless you opt for the themed rooms, but then the price is higher. Court is beautifully kept and suitable for an arrival or departure tea. Wifi is good and strong as was the A/c in our room. Tastefully remodelled space. Breakfast on the terrace is hit or miss - sweet breads are made at one time it appears so unless you arrive first, yours may be cold and crusty. Simple breakfast with fruit and yogurt that can also be found on the water just a 10 minute walk away. Enquired about the ‚Äúspa‚Äù a ‚ÄúHammam‚Äù and say a very small closet that had been converted. Didn‚Äôt leave me with confidence in the experience or in who might be qualified among the staff to deliver the‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2019,5,World Class Hospitality,"As my first stop in Morocco, I‚Äôm impressed with the beauty of this Riad. Beyond the unassuming entrance lies a beautiful courtyard with moorish architecture and morrocan accents. The rooftop terrace is a quiet paradise perfect to enjoy my favorite mint tea. The hospitality of the staffs put me at home from the get-go. Hamed has been my go to person when I have a question, he‚Äôs very helpful and knowledgeable. Love my split level room and the food is amazing. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place. Beautiful Riad with a top notch hospitality. Well recommend.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2019,5,Great place to stay,"Rooftop view is very nice especially for sunset and sunrise view. Bear in mind that guests staying there should not make any noise after a certain time (that means no loud sex, haha). Room is nice and location is very convenient as it's near to the Rabat Medina.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2019,5,Excellent,"The property is historical yet clean and neat. The employees are very welcoming ans have good customer care. The food and the tea has been great and I will not miss to come over and over again. Internet is very fast, and the services are great.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2019,5,Wonderful staff!,Riad Dar el kabira is perfectly located in the medina. The staff is incredible! Younes or Ahmed are always here to assist you and always with a smile. Anane the chief cook of the hotel is great . I recommend!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2019,5,A Moorish Dream,"If a genie would come out of a lamp and ask me what I want right now, it would be to go back to Rabat and stay at this Riad again. Nicely tucked in the heart of the medina, it surely is a sight for sore eyes. Being a first timer in Morocco, I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the Riad‚Äôs Moorish architecture, its inward facing sunlit courtyard, the interior d√©cor and the mosaic tilework that intricately adorns its walls and staircases. My room was just sublime, authentically laid in Moroccan tradition. I absolutely enjoyed my breakfasts and late evenings on the terrace, as the cool Atlantic breeze blew over the rooftops overlooking the meandering streets below. It was such a great experience being in the real living space of the local population, and watching real life happening‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2019,5,Beautiful place,"The interior looks like a museum. It was our first Riad in Morocco, and the most beautiful. The owners are very nice and helpful. We had a medical emergency during our trip, and they went out of their way helping us with advice in this difficult situation in a foreign country. One aspect to keep in mind is that the Riad is inside the Medina, no car traffic. You have to walk for 3-5 minutes to get to the place.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2019,3,Mixed Experience,"This riad is lovely, and if you get the right room you will probably enjoy your stay. Ours overlooked a narrow alley where motorcycles, heated conversation, street games and music kept us up night and day (more precisely, from about 2 pm till about 4 a.m.). It was impossible to sleep or even read, and the TV and air conditioning couldn't help because they weren't working. After three days of this we were pretty bonkers.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2019,3,Mixed Review,"This riad is beautiful, the staff is gracious, and breakfast on the roof terrace is sweet. However, our room overlooked a narrow echo chamber of an alley where very loud voices ricocheted from noon until 10 pm our first night, 11 pm the second and ultimately, on our third night, until midnight. It was impossible to nap in the afternoon or sleep at night or even to read. Tried to distract ourselves with the TV but it was broken. Tightened the windows in a vain attempt to bring down the decibel level and suffered because the a.c. didn't work. This was during ramadan, and along with various calls to prayer, which we were prepared for, came amplified singing under our windows between 2 and 4 a.m. Don't book here unless you plan to sleep only perhaps between 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. (and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2019,5,Great location and great Riad.,The Riad is located in the Medina. It is very close to the ocean and the souks. It was very easy to get around. I could easily walk to all the sites and find my walk back. The Riad was beautiful. The room was lovely. The staff was very helpful.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2019,5,Hidden Gem,This delightful Riad is so beautiful on the inside with traditional Moroccan decor. The staff are friendly and attentive to any request. They have a small hammam and offer massage. The food is traditional and flavourful. The room comes with breakfast and is also plentiful and delicious.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2019,5,Lovely visit,"I loved the ""secret"" location of this riad off the main road and down a pedestrian walkway. The space was beautiful and comfortable, the staff were very friendly, and our team enjoyed great breakfasts out on the terrace.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2019,5,Lovely place,"Beautiful rooms in a traditional Moroccan riad. No hair conditioner offered and I had a leaking sink, but those don't stop me from giving this place a great rating. I've been there many times now and love it.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2019,3,Be advised,"The Riad is clean and comfortable. The rooms are sufficiently spacious and the decor is nice. It is located inside the M√©dina- it can be hard to find and I don‚Äôt think it is wise for a single female to stay here alone unless you have someone to walk you there in the evening (the Riad is safe but I don‚Äôt advise walking through the M√©dina alone at night). Breakfast is nice, the food is traditional Moroccan and good quality. The service is slow- you need at least 45 min. I did have one issue with this Riad- I understand local custom is to open windows but it was disconcerting to return to my room and find the windows that open into the courtyard (1st floor) open. Anyone could have entered and had access to my things. I addressed this with the gal in the office who assured me she‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2019,1,Before You Book--Don't,"We are going to Morocco in two weeks. We booked this hotel 6 months ago. We received an email two weeks before our departure that said due to a technical error that they had in their system they were canceling our booking. There are either two choices here. They are incompetent, or I have a piece of the Brooklyn Bridge and I will sell it to you. Trip Advisor has reviews for good reason. To help others when they travel. You all can decide for yourselves",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2019,4,Excellent Service,"All of the staff working in this Riad are very kind and welcoming, and we even got a free upgrade from the Marsa room to the Souissi suite! We were welcomed with mint tea and these delicious little biscuits and were shown every courtesy possible. Dinner with the lamb tagine was well done, and they even gave us an extra flan since the two of us were sharing one three-course menu! It was really a kind gesture on their part. Ahmed helped us with our luggage and found us a taxi to the train station and everyone was very pleasant in general. The only reason we are not giving it five stars is because the Riad seemed a little old and could use a little polishing up. But overall, a good choice if you find yourself in Rabat!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2019,5,Absolutely Lovely in Every Way,"Dar el Kebira exceeded my expectations and hopes. I stayed for four heavenly nights at this wonderful establishment tucked just inside the medina and would return in a heartbeat. After my transportation, arranged by Dar el Kebira, dropped me, Yunez warmly welcomed me and led me to the property where Safoune welcomed me again, reviewed an excellent map with me and ensured I would settle in pleasantly. Thrilled by the elegant interior decoration complementing the stunning centuries old tiles and fretwork, I retired to my large and inviting room. There were all the little special touches such as bottled water, bathrobes and flip flops, making my stay that much more comfortable. Their restaurant features superb Moroccan cuisine; actually some of the best I've had in three‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2019,5,Great!,"We enjoyed our stay at the Riad Dar El Kebira, - we were welcomed friendly - the room was nice - dinner was amazing (the best Moroccan I had during my two weeks in Morocco) - breakfast was a large selection of local food and plentiful - hammam and massage were very relaxing",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2019,5,A real moroccan experience,"We came from Belgium to discover and enjoy the authentic side of the moroccan culture and Dar El kebira Riad was an excellent experience for us. The location is just perfect to visit other must see places in the heart of the capital and it‚Äôs also close to the beach. We‚Äôd like to thank the riad‚Äôs staff for their kindness, their help and their good sens of humour, and especially Miss Samhae Moussahal for her hospitality and her practical suggestions. The food is not just delicious but presented as masterpieces and reflecting the authentic moroccan tastes, we just loved that ! The room was a typical sheherazade arabian nights space where you‚Äôll want to spend the entire day.. but you definitely should go enjoy the breakfast in the sunny rooftop ! We‚Äôll come again for sure..‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2018,4,Clean and traditional,This Hotel is small and friendly Boutique Hotel in my opinion. Staying here very much felt like 'Traditional' Morocco. It a good choice for couples and those who are not looking for a big International hotel.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2019,2,Desapointed,It‚Äôs ab2.5- 3 star hotel it‚Äôs no good and nice the furniture Floor and walls need tone paint and clean TV HAS A PROBLEM and the shower the same running water and dirt Safe deposit box in room you can take the box out of the room,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2019,4,"Excellent location, wonderful staff...","The location was excellent for our short stay in Rabat. The service is wonderful as well. However, I was a bit disappointed in how tired everything appeared. The bathroom in our suite was in dire need of a paint job. Sheets and bedding really need to be updated, as well. It just had the feel of neglect, which is a pity because the building is so beautiful. I don‚Äôt regret staying here because of the warmth of the staff, however, I was happy it was only a one night stay.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2019,4,"Beautiful riad, excellent location","Nicely restored riad with a convenient location near the shore. Common areas are spectacular. Had a comfortable bed in a spacious room. WiFi good, satellite tv needed attention. A few details in the room and bathroom were rough, such as light fixtures that had burned-out bulbs, a bathroom sink without a stopper, and a wobbly holder for the showerhead. Breakfast was fine, but service was slow and not attentive. Staff were friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. While very good, we had been spoiled by a flawless stay at another riad, so we may have been pickier than otherwise. Also, should you stay in a room with windows opening onto the street, make sure to ask how to close the exterior shutters to cut out the street lighting.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2018,5,Excellent,"We stayed at both of the branches of this Riad. One is the older more established, the other is newer and less established. They are 3 min from each other. The service is impeccable. They came to the parking area and picked us up. They took our luggage up to our room. The rooms are spacious in both. The newer Riad has an elevator which helps because Riads all have steep stairs. All the rooms have TVs but limited English channels. It doesn‚Äôt really matter because there is so much to see and enjoy and savor that tv was not our priority. The bathroom in the newer Riad bathroom was tiny but there was a walk in shower. The older Riad had a bigger bathroom but the tub was a fall hazard. It was so narrow that I felt I was going to fall over while showering. There were robes and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2019,4,Good location in Rabat,"Stayed here one night during a road trip up the coast of Morocco. The dar is located down a quiet street in the Medina that is a quick 5 minute walk from the Kasbah and sea. The dar is a bit rundown, which isn‚Äôt a problem, but the photographs that are shown here on TripAdvisor are a little deceiving. We came here with my in-laws, and their room was a bit nicer with a nice standing shower. Our bedroom was located upstairs and had a comfortable mattress, but the shower/tub was cramped and difficult to bathe in without feeling like you were going to fall over. Breakfast here was the best we‚Äôve had while in Morocco due to the variety of food and how fresh it all was; we were given yogurt, fruit bowl, fresh lemon water, typical Moroccan pastries, cheese, honey, and coffee/tea.

 November 2018,5,Excellent Service,"The hotel is ideally located in the Medina of Rabat.

They even upgraded us to a better room. Overall, a very enjoyable experience!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2018,5,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Rabat medina.,"A truly beautiful place, the sweetest atmosphere and the nicest staff. I was there on to film a video and the manager allowed us to shoot in the hall, which saved our life because the location was the best I could have asked! Rooms are clean, beautiful and comfortable. Breakfast is great and cooked with love.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2018,5,Awesome stay,"We had a blast staying there. The rooms are so beautifully colored! No stress at all from the staff and reaaaaally great service. the terrasse on the rooftop offers a gorgeous view of the city. Moreover, everything in the medina is close by. Would totally go back there to enjoy a good stay!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2018,4,Surprise gem and a true taste of Rabat,"Stayed here for 1 night as part of a work trip and was pleasantly surprised at the real traditional gem in the middle of the old town Rabat. Dont get me wrong, when walking through with my case I was petrified what I had done wrong in choosing this place where all colleagues were in chain hotels, and yes the place is pretty on impossible to find when unknown to the area. Once in, my perception changed completely. Lovely friendly welcome and a welcome drink whilst we waited in the central lounge area. The rooms were ok for 1 night with a bottle of water and welcome snacks. Wifi worked well and so everything that was needed was present. OK so the rooms opening into the indoor courtyard is a tad bizarre to get used to but its traditional. Cant say I heard that much noise‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2018,3,"Old property, friendly staff","The property is very old, you feel the floors, doors and everything is patched up. The staff is friendly and helpful, breakfast is good, location is ok, you still have to walk with your luggage to get there which is the case with any Riad in the Medina.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2018,5,Customer service 6/5,Riad is decorated in such a beautiful way that you don¬¥t mind spending time in your room or in the lovely rooftop terrace. Nothing like boring hotel rooms where you stay for nights rest - accommodation here is experience itself! We enjoyed tasty breakfast every morning and had dinner at the Riad as well. Dinner especially was super tasty. They listened our special requests both in breakfast and dinner so we really got what we wanted. The ultimate best thing was great service we received. All the staff members were kind and made us feel like home. They helped us with everything we needed and spoke very good English! As I work in hospitality business myself - I can honestly say that customer service can¬¥t get any better than this.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2018,5,Don‚Äôt hesitate to book.,Superb Riad! Our room was spacious and amenities made available. Breakfast is served on the rooftop which has some great views. We missed breakfast on our last day but the staff were very accommodating and offered us a late brekkie with late check out at no extra cost! Executive customer service. We were also allowed to leave our luggage until the evening and they also printed off our boarding passes. Would stay here again. Take a boat over to Sale and spend a day getting lost in the madness there.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2018,5,Quiet Luxury in Rabat,"Fantastic experience from start to finish. The riad is gorgeous and tucked away in the old Medina. Service was outstanding, all staff was friendly and helpful. Food was delicious. We felt very comfortable and safe throughout our stay. Highly recommend Dar El Kebira!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2018,4,Lovely Riad in heart of the market.,"Friendly staff spoke English and arranged everything perfectly. Delicious dinner and breakfast, Stayed one nite and room was very nice, but linens need replacement. Bathtub was difficult to use, slippery and narrow. Experience was authentic and enjoyable. I would recommend this Riad in Rabat. Excellent location.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2018,4,Good Hotel with Good restaurant,"We, a retired couple, stayed at this hotel in the Rabat Medina for 2 nights in September while visiting the city. The hotel is located in the very centre of the Medina. It might have been hard to find, but the hotel arranged a pick-up at the station and then had someone meet us at a drop-off point to lead us through the maze of laneways to the Riad. The accommodations are typical of a Riad, with rooms on multiple floors overlooking an interior courtyard. The d√©cor has a pleasant, ornate, oriental flavor. Our comfortable room was on the second floor and consisted of a separate comfortable bedroom and sitting area. The ground floor had two bedrooms and a long salon used as a dining area, as well as ornate furniture spread around the central space. We ate dinner in the Riad‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2018,5,Great value for money,"Very friendly and helpful staff, conveniently located with super fast internet. Charming ambience; not the highest quality but you're not paying through the roof either. The rooms were small but well decorated and pleasing. Well worth the money..",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Our first Riad,"It was our first Riad, and the expectations were high, but exceeded. We had a friendly welcome with mint tea sitting relaxed in the beautiful hall while checking in. The Riad is in a good position in the Medina. The service was attentive, the supper and breakfast on the rooftop was tasty and we enjoyed the lovely view. The rooms were clean and nicely arranged. We recommend this Riad.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Our first Riad,"It was our first Riad and the expectations were high, but they were exceded. We had a friendly welcome with mint tea sitting relaxed in the beautiful hall while checking in. The house is a wonderful arrangement. We had tasty suppers and breakfast on the rooftop enjoying the view over the Medina. Service was very attentive. We recommend that Riad.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Superb Riad!,"We fully enjoyed our stay in that riad in Rabat. Excellent service, extremely friendly staff, good breakfast on the terrace. The Riad is good located in the Medina of Rabat. Everything can be easily reached by walking. The medina of Rabat is our favourite, becaus of the friendly people there. They don‚Äòt bother you all the time!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Zwin bizef!,"Our stay at Dar El Kebira was great. The staff was welcoming, easily accessible, and accommodated all our requests. When we arrived, Hamid met us at our car a little ways away from the hotel and escorted us there. He also helped us orient ourselves to Rabat. The location of the hotel was great; near the Oudayas and right in the old medina. The staff were also very flexible; for example, we slept through breakfast one day and they still prepared a full wonderful breakfast for us almost an hour late. We also enjoyed the hammam experience we had, and were able to book it last minute. I would highly recommend Dar El Kebira for anyone who visits Rabat :)",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Beautiful Riad conveniently located in the old city,"We loved our stay here! The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, and the riad itself is beautiful. It is also conveniently located in the old city. I would highly recommend this riad to couples visiting Rabat!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2018,4,Best part of visit to Rabat...,"We discovered this lovely gem in the Medina when searching for a hammam.... had a perfect afternoon of lunch, hammam and massage. Such a beautiful, clean, relaxing setting in the heart of the medina in Rabat. We highly recommend Dar El Kebira and hope to actually stay at the hotel on our next visit to Rabat.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2018,5,"Lovely hotel, great staff","We stayed here for two nights, we loved the location inside the Medina. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, served on the terrace. I highly recommend this hotel. My family and I enjoyed every minute of it.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2018,5,Lovely hotel,"Great, intimate hotel in the heart of the medina. You have to walk from the main road into the medina but it is well worth it! Accommodation delightful, traditional Moroccan decor and design with a very relaxing atmosphere. Breakfast on the roof terrace was a lovely start to the day. Youness and the rest of the staff very attentive, patient and obliging. Highly recommended. 10/10",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2018,5,Very comfortable Riad - close to the entrance of the medina,"We accidentally booked 2 rooms, so I can say that both were lovely. Mine was nicer, with claw footed tub. Daughter's was comfortable. Lovely terrace breakfast - typically Moroccan except probably larger and you have the option to add an egg - recommended, since lunch is served late and you will walk a lot. Very accommodating staff. This is not a modern hotel - it's a Riad - traditional building - the common area is beautiful and not air conditioned. The rooms have good a/c. The entrance is close to the entrance to the medina - which makes it easy to bring in your luggage.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2018,5,Luxury Stay in Rabat Medina's Heart!,"Dar El Kebira is the PERFECT Riad for your stay in Rabat!! My boyfriend and I loved it from the very beginning and we enjoyed every moment we spent there. Relaxing, Cleaned, Quite and with the most helpful and friendly staff. Breakfast on the rooftop (best view on the city) was amazing with delicious fresh Orange juice and Yummy bread and Jam. I also absolutely loved the room, stylish and cozy, and the bed was super comfortable. I recommend it to everyone who wants to enjoy Rabat and have a lovely time in a beautiful riad. Thanks!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2018,5,Veeeeery nice!,A very nice riad in the middle of the old city. Yet it's very quiet when you are inside. Such a lovely 'palace' when the door opens. The rooms are very big and decorated with good taste. We almost felt like our honeymoon ‚ù§,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2018,5,Great Riad for a Rabat visit!,"This riad deserves its praise and high ratings. Great location, comfortable rooms and the breakfast on the terrace is lovely. The food quality is quite high. Note, as with many Riad's, this is located in the old Medina. If you walk to it from the nearest train station, like I did, going through the Medina, you will be in for a very rocky walk as many of the winding foot paths in the Medina are under construction and the cobble stones are torn up. Tough going with a roller bag, though glad to see my Away bag held up to the punishment. This Riad is in the north eastern corner of the Medina about a two min. walk to a main, paved street. If you walk THAT way you'll have an easier time of it.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2018,5,"Lovely Riad, friendly, helpful, clean.","Great rood top views, lovely room. Youness also helped us call ahead to our Riad in Fes. Quaint and small, baggage transfer from main street and slow paced continental Moroccan style breakfast included.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2018,5,Flawless hospitality,"Gorgeous traditional riad in the Rabat medina. Our stay was flawless, from the warm welcome with excellent mint tea to the beautifully decorated rooms. We stayed as a family with 3 teenagers, and the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home and cared for. Excellent breakfast and delicious dinners. We very much look forward to returning in the future.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2018,5,A small quality riad,This is a smaller riad compared to some but very well fitted out. Traditional riad design can be noisy due to the central courtyard design but at Riad Sara care has been taken with the doors and curtains so that you can close yourself off from the world. Breakfast on the roof top was first class and ranks as one of the best I have had in Morocco.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2018,5,"Perfect place to stay in Rabat, Morocco","This is a wonderful Riad based in the medina of Rabat. It has both charm and service in equal measure and doesn‚Äôt miss a beat - their rooms are clean and functioning as well as being beautifully decorated, their breakfasts delicious and plentiful, and the people they have chosen to work within the Riad are excellent; they are present as and when you need anything, and are kind and generous in how they can make your stay as hospitable as possible. The atmosphere is one of a professionally personalised run home with character and plenty of space. There is also a hammam and treatment room as well as a few places to sit and relax outside of your room. I have stayed here twice and the Manager generously upgraded me on my return visit; I did not expect this at all and he and his team‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2018,5,Gorgeous room. Wonderful hospitality.,"Great location in the medina, near the Kasbah and souks. A hotel employee came out to transport our luggage and escort us to the riad (our driver dropped us off on a main street, a fair distance away). We were welcomed with mint tea and cookies in the beautiful courtyard before the porter carried up our bags and showed us our room (on the second floor, facing a small (not the main) courtyard). Our room was absolutely exquisitely decorated in a traditional Moroccan style‚Äîprobably the most beautiful hotel room I have ever seen, with much thoughtful attention in arranging every lovely detail. The room is admittedly quite small, but perfectly sufficient for my wife and I. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, and we slept very well. Breakfast was served on the rooftop‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2018,5,Authentic and Charming. Perfect Location.,"Dar El Kebira is located right next to the magnificent Kasbah de Oudayas and the Medina district of Rabat. Beautifully traditional, with stunning architecture and woodwork, beaming with light and traditional music playing in the background. Authentic and charming. My Pinede Suite was on the first floor overlooking the courtyard and the lounge area. Spacious yet homely, with full poster king size bed, TV, air con. Bathroom with all mod cons including toiletries, towels, dressing gowns and slippers. You can book a hammam treatment at the riad after a flight to scrub away all impurities, worries and stress. Perfect way to restore harmony and balance. The rooftop terrace is beautiful offering incredible views of the famous Hassan Tower, the perfect spot to kick back after a day‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Elegance in the Souk,",Wasn't sure what to expect after walking down many alleys and asking many folks for directions. Then-arrived at this non descript door. When it opened, an entire new world appeared...absolutely beautiful. I had heard of RIADs but did not know that this hotel was a riad Our stay could not have been nicer-from the beautiful bedroom to the breakfast on the terrace. The greeter and porter met us, took us to our room and, upon departure, he pushed our bags nearly a half mile and hailed a taxi. They were so helpful and unassuming. This is a must stay, trust me!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2018,4,Good Experience,"Good experience in very local property. The location is very central to visit Rabat. Kind staff. Lovely dinner and breakfast on the terrace. The Riad has a very well kept atmosphere, with many details.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2018,4,Breakfast with a view.,"A group of long-time friends (couple and solo woman) spent one somewhat jet lagged night at the Dar el Kebira in April 2018 after arriving late that afternoon in Casablanca. This is not a hotel with a front desk and many rooms. It is the Moroccan equivalent of the British B&B, with just a few rooms. Dinner (a delicious tagine) was at the Dar, as is the custom. The rooms were well equipped and they retained beautiful details of the house in its conversion to a Riad. The classic old bathtub was a bit tricky to stand in to shower. Sounds do travel, we could hear the sports fans watching a game in one of the terrace rooms. But it was perfectly quiet at night for sleeping. The beautiful, and large, breakfast was served on one of the terraces with the views out over the‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2018,5,"Wonderful , centrally located Riad in Rabat","My husband and I had our first impression of Morocco by staying at the lovely, authentic Moroccan Riad in the capitol city of Rabat. After being greeted in the beautiful central court with the customary mint tea and cookies , we enjoyed the traditional style Moroccan home with lovely mosiac's all around, a central fountain and plush furniture catering to comfort. Our room had a small dressing niche, petite bathroom and a loft comfortable bed. Dinner was excellent, served in a personalized style of small tables with lovely linens and breakfast was served on the rooftop with a nice view of the older city and skyline of Rabat. The food was delicious, the people very accommodating, the location right withing the market area and a few short blocks to the ocean and waled city gates.‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2018,4,Unique Location,"I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in the heart of the Rabat medina and close to great shopping, the beach, and sightseeing. The staff are incredibly warm and friendly, and the roof top is wonderful for breakfast.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2017,5,"Had a really nice stay, perfect location","Definitely recommend this place - very conveniently located to the Kasbah Oudayas and the beach, and to the interesting walks in the Rabat medina. Extremely friendly and helpful porters. The breakfast on the roof patio was wonderful.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2018,5,Very pleasant stay and friendly staff at Dar El Kebira,"I stayed here for business and the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially with navigating the medina. It does take a little figuring out (where you're going), but the riad is beautiful with well appointed rooms that are clean and comfortable. I felt very much at home. I ate several nights at the riad and was pleased with the food selection and quality.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2018,4,Beautiful Riad in the Rabat medina,"This is a very beautiful Riad... we enjoyed our stay there. We stayed here for one night on our return trip from Marrakech and didn‚Äôt have s lot of time, but enjoyed the beautiful courtyard, rooftop, and had a very nice meal in the restaurant. Our room was not one of the suites and was a spec small for the price. Also, there was a used bar of soap in the shower that was a bit disconcerting. Outside of these two things, the place was wonderful. The free breakfast is huge and delicious. We had a fabulous dinner in the restaurant where the chicken pastilla was one of my favorite bites from my entire trip.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2018,5,Beautiful authentic Riad with lovely staff,"If you want to stay somewhere authentic with beautiful interior , great service , amazing food AND in the heart of the Riad then this is the place ! It was amazing ! The dinner was delicious , the complimentary brekkie was on the rooftop and just perfect ! It was warm in winter with lovely endless hot water . And as far as nice hotel prices in Morrocco go this was very well priced ! Thank you !",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2018,5,5 star luxury yet affordable!!,"I found this Riad by chance and could not have been happier. Inside, the place looks like a castle, impeccable interior design. The staff is very kind and accommodating. The manager is super friendly and gives good advice on where to shop for what. They even helped me with finding a babysitter so I could take surf lessons at Medina surfing which is right next door!! Breakfast is served on the terass and all the meals are very generous. Also, lots of tourist sites (the market/medina, the casbah, the tower of Hassan, the marina) are walking distance from here!!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2018,5,10 Reasons to stay at Dar El Kebira,"As a regular business traveller for many years, I always find the temptation to stay with one of the big corporate chains difficult to resist ‚Äì simple convenience coupled with the comfortable expectation of the familiar wins out. Time spent researching where to ‚Äòget your head down‚Äô is often seen as wasted: this trip felt different ‚Äì a long weekend in an unfamiliar place, where we sought just a flavour of the locale. Dar El Kebira far exceeded the high expectations with which we set out: 1. THE WELCOME STARTS BEFORE THE VISIT An email from Safouane greeted us before our arrival ‚Äì enquiring as to likely time of arrival and whether we would require an evening meal. Our flight arrived late evening, so the sensible option was clear: order from the menu, using the hyperlink‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2018,5,Incredibly Accommodating,"Riad Dar El Kebira was maybe the most accommodating place we have stayed in. They have a beautiful family feel, great architecture and interior design. Fresh fruit, water and toiletries in the room. Which is HUGE! And the service is 10/10. I really would recommend this Riad to anyone visiting the Rabat area.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2018,4,It‚Äôs not your father‚Äôs motel,"A Riad is a cross between a very small hotel and a B and B. This was the first time we had stayed in one. There are about 6 rooms around a central courtyard. The room was long but very narrow, being barely enough for a double bed and space to squeeze in. The sitting area was also small and we could not get the TV to go on. The flies, however seemed to have enough room although they did not disturb us at all while we slept. The decor was charming and very Moroccan. Mattress was excellent. The bathroom was very large, disproportionately so given the size of the room. The staff was outstanding‚Äîfriendly and welcoming. Breakfast was very good and plentiful but you basically took what they had.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2018,5,Authentic local experience,Noel and the rest of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The Riad is very authentic Moroccan and not terribly modern. The team treated us like family. The only caution is concerning the taxi service organized by the Riad - the fare is very expensive compared to what you can get on your own. Otherwise a great place.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2018,4,Lovely stay,"A very beautiful property which is very nicely decorated. Staff including everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. First night was in a room on two levels. Lovely room but rather tight on space in the room and toilet. Very kindly upgraded next day to a larger room which was much more comfortable. Breakfast on the roof top was very homely and nice although the broken dishes could certainly do with replacement. No hesitation in recommending although for anyone staying the first time in a riad, please ensure you know how it compares with a regular hotel!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2017,5,Great stay,"Friendly and helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms. Dinner and breakfast were traditional and delicious. We only had a short overnight stay but it was a very nice one. The Riad was also in a great location.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2017,4,Business hotel with charm,"Pleasant stay, very friendly and helpful staff, very good food. Pricey, but worth the money. As a business traveller it offered me the services I needed but remained a homey and rustic place. A gym is close by and other services such as internet are adequate.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2017,5,Beautiful and friendly Riad in Rabat,"This was our first stop in Morocco; what a wonderful introduction to the hospitality of the people of Morocco. A beautiful hotel, traditional decor, very comfortable rooms. We had a choice of rooms, chose a room upstairs for privacy and quiet. Dinner in the Riad our first night was delicious. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. The staff (manager Nawal Rajabi; porters/waiters Youness and Hamid) were very helpful and attentive. Only minor complaint was wifi connection was inconsistent; Nawal admitted she was having trouble with the router.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2017,5,A Quick Night in Rabat,"My party of three stayed here for just one night, yet it was by far the most memorable venue we stayed at during our week in Morocco! Great location, clean rooms, good food, and amazing staff. I would absolutely stay here again! Big shout-out to Rawal for making our stay feel like home!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2017,5,Warm home in the middle of the medina,I have been in Riad Dar El Kebira and I was impressed with the quality of service and welcome we received by the staff.

 October 2017,4,Beautifully authentic riad,We received a lovely welcome at this beautifully maintained period Riad. The architecture and interior design were a joy to admire and the service was first class. We ate a traditional Moroccan dinner in the comfortable area and we served breakfast on the terrace with great views of the city.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2017,5,Charming Riad,What a lovely place - it oozes charm. The service was outstanding - I found that speaking French was a big advantage with the staff. We had dinner in the riad and the food was excellent. We ordered quite a variety and we were happy with all choices. Recommend having a tea or breakfast on the rooftop terrace. Great perspective on the city. Front desk staff also very accommodating. Room for 3 was very nice - a little tight but that was actually part of its charm! So much nicer staying in abroad like this vs a big hotel.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

 October 2017,5,Perfect place for a tea on the rooftop!,"The place is beautiful, clean, and the rooftop offers a great view on the Medina. The staff is welcoming and friendly, and the tea is very good, serves with few basic pastries. A piece of heaven in Rabat!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2017,4,"An ancient private home converted in a hotel, warts and all","What can be improved: my room had not outside windows, and had glass doors: fresh air, light and privacy were insufficient. You should inform your guest in advance of this! This is the downside of a hotel coming from a home: it might be acceptable in a family but it is not in a hotel. What is very good: the staff is very friendly, available and helpful; the terrace has a nice view and the breackfast served there is excellent. These are strenghts for the hotel",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Highly Recommended Stay for Anyone Wanting to Experience Rabat,It's very close to a lot of the landmarks and is located in the northeast corner of the Medina. The hotel is very clean and ornate. The staff would go out of their way for anything you need. They serve great local cuisine which is a little pricey compared to other places but honestly it tasted the best out of all of them. They also have modern amentities such as a/c and warm showers as well.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2016,5,"Lovely, perfectly presented","A lovely Riad in a very good location. The staff were very pleasant, friendly, attentive and helpful. The rooms were all different in size, layout and furnishing and, as we were with a group, we got to look into most of the different rooms - all were lovely. We loved our room (La Pinde) and had a very comfortable stay. The very good breakfast served on the rooftop terrace was a great way to end our visit.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Still my favorite place,"For the second time but with my husband , as they used to welcoming guest even at a late time this riad is like a home on my point of view you can arrive at any time you will find someone waits for you ,our flight was late for one hour as arranged and without informing the reception ,we found the man (HAMITH) still waiting for us . We recognized the way to the hotel following the signs that was well implanted , the stylish streets still the same I think nothing can be changed because of the traditional,simple and quiet area. The breakfast on the roof was magical enough to more than one person, dinner also was delightful ,getting the menthe tea on the roof at night in that amazing weather of rabat it really deserves to be experienced Thank you nawal for your help also ‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Great location and personalized service,"Hotel has a great location in the heart of the old Medina. Easy to find (follow the green signs). Beautiful authentic Moroccan rooms and cuisine. The best rooms are on the 2nd floor. 3rd floor rooftop serves as the breakfast area and has a great view across much of the city and to the water. There is a small hammam and massage area on the 3rd floor which was steamily delicious. The entire staff was very warm and helpful.

 August 2017,5,Magical Experience,"I enjoyed my stay at Riad Dar El Kebira, cosy room come with authentic decor and it feels like home, so tradition.

You get what you pay for, guaranteed!!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2017,5,"We enjoyed it so much, we booked it again!","Riad Dar el Kebira was the first place we stayed in Morocco. We enjoyed it so much, we booked it again for the end of our trip and got an additional room for a friend! Cars cannot enter the medina, so you can park adjacent to the medina or get dropped off at the entrance to the medina. You can call the hotel to send someone to guide you and help with the luggage or you can follow the green signs (which we did) to the hotel. It is at most a 5 minute walk with just two right turns. The staff is very welcoming and brings tea and snacks to the courtyard while you register. The rooms are beautiful and the air conditioning is a blessing! I had a walking cast and easily managed the walk to the riad, the stairs to the second floor room, the stairs within the two-level room, and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2017,4,The hammam was a great experience,"We came to this Riad to have our first hammam experience and it was amazing. The lady didn't speak English though but that didn't really matter. After the hammam we ordered a few snacks and they told us 20 minutes, which wasn't true. After almost an hour we told them we're leaving, we had another appointment, and waiting almost an hour for some snacks is ridiculous.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2017,5,Another lovely stay at the riad,"I stayed here for the second time in the past year, and was again delighted. The staff is welcoming and attentive, and the room was wonderful. we slept with the windows open to hear the sounds of the city. The breakfasts on the roof are sumptuous, and we ate dinner twice in the exotic dining room. I highly recommend this place. Easy walk to the best of the medina, the beach, the casbah, Hassan Tower. Only issue was pickup at Casablanca Airport. I recommend either taking a cab or the train rather than relying on the car service from the hotel.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2017,5,Nice Riad in Rabat Medina,Great experience in a traditional riad. The building is beautiful and has some great traditional rooms as well as a nice rooftop. Breakfast is really good and the staff is very helpful for recommendations and travel issues.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

 June 2017,3,"Nice and authentic, small rooms though","Riad was beautiful and looked very tidy, our room was pretty small though. Breakfast was very rich. Location is also good, in the medina, near the kasbah and close to the beach (10min/walking). Parking was possible on the nearby parkinglot, no problems.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2017,5,Great Place to Stay in Rabat Medina,"The Riad is perfect. Well located, excellent multi-lingual staff who helped us with everything: driver, airport pick up, touring, restaurants. The breakfast was wonderful with Moroccan specialties each day and the views from the roof top terrace are great. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to the Kasbah, medina and many great restaurants.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2017,5,First Stay in Morocco and it was Wonderful,"We had just flown 15 hours plus taken a Train from Casablanca to Rabat, so we were tired. We were given great directions to find the Riad, the only problem I did not read which gate to start at. Plenty of signs directing you if you start at the correct gate. Smail greeted us at the door and took our bags to our room. He then offered us Tea, Coffee, and snacks. Nawal took care of all our paperwork. I swear it was like Smail and Nawal were our best friends welcoming us into their home. They gave us a tour of the Riad and explained when and where breakfast would be. They also offered to have us have dinner at the Riad which we excepted. Dinner was fantastic. Smail was not just the bellmen, he was also the waiter for dinner, and the waiter at Breakfast which was served on the roof‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2017,5,"Lovely and relaxing, great service too",I enjoyed my stay at Dar El Kebira!! It was tricky to find but there are large signs showing the way. The riad was gorgeous and I enjoyed my room. I arrived very late after a delayed flight and the gentleman quickly checked me in and showed me to my room. Breakfast was on the roof top and more than I could eat! I got suggestions on sites before I headed out for the day which were helpful also. After a long hot day of sightseeing it was great to relax on the roof top before a tasty dinner at the riad. Thank you for my stay. I will return next time I'm in Rabat and would recommend to my friends and family.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2017,4,"Great location, friendly staff","A beautiful common area and lovely rooftop. Staff were very friendly and food was delicious. Harissa soup for dinner was particularly good! Room was comfortable, not as spectacular as some others we have stayed in (but we had been quite spoiled up until that point!) Location was excellent- close to the sea, all major monuments and the old town.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2017,5,Lovely Riad in the heart of the medina,I stayed at this Riad for two nights with two of my friends. The staff were extremely helpful as I needed to email them with a couple of queries before we arrived and they always responded promptly with helpful information. Finding the Riad was easy - we had difficulties with finding our accommodation in Marrakech so were concerned - as there were sign posts helping us find the location throughout the medina. The staff were extremely friendly throughout our stay particularly the staff member that served our breakfast each morning and took our bags to our taxi on our last day. As our room was split over two levels we found there wasn't a lot of excess space to put our bags and move around but overall the room was very pleasant. The room also had the best wifi connection we had‚Ä¶,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2017,5,"So welcoming, you may never want to leave...","We park outside the medina and wind our way on foot through the covered alleys to our lodging for the night - the Dar El Kabira Riad. We walk through an unassuming wooden door and into a courtyard, 3 stories tall, covered at the top with a pyramid-shaped glass ceiling. It is astoundingly beautiful, filled with light, as well as a variety of furniture and artifacts. We are invited to sit down, and are offered glasses of tea while our passports are being. processed. I am admiring a very large set of carved double doors with large barrel locks, wondering where the door leads to. Soon, we are given our keys and are led to our rooms. I nearly fall over backwards when the door I have been admiring, turns out to be the door to my room ... The room has the dimensions of a large‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2017,4,Riad Dar El Kebira,Very friendly & helpful staff. Nice rooftop breakfast. Excellent position in the Medina next to the souk. The Necropolis of Chellah complete with nesting storks is worth a visit only a short blue taxi ride away. Entrance fee 10Drm.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2017,5,The most efficient and kind hotel staff I have ever met,"Not only an authentic and beautiful setting, the staff, especially the manager is devoted to the well being of her guests. I have encountered some problems with Royal Air Maroc regarding my flight ticket and it was impossible to solve it, making my trip very hectic. But the manager insisted to help me and to get my flight ticket right, she spent hours with the aircraft company and finally got me on the right plane. In addition, she organised all the transfers to Casablanca accordingly. Her colleagues are also warm, smiling and devoted.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2017,4,Warm small hotel,"One night stay in Medina area. Charming staff in hotel which seems like it could have been a residence. No elevator. Small room but common areas and rooftop sitting area are really nice. Close walk to waterfront, sook, and Oudayas casbah.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2017,4,The authentic Moroccan experience...,Riad Dar el kabira was our first Riad experience and it did not disappoint us at all.The ambience is awesome and the service is excellent .The staff is very courteous and smiling.I loved the room decor. Breakfast served by Ismail at the rooftop was the most relaxing experience.The only thing not in its favour was that the room was slightly small.Otherwise we totally enjoyed our stay there .I would highly recommend it to other families .Thank you for a very nice stay.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2017,4,A nice place.,"The Riad looked good but there were a couple of hiccups. Our room was occupied by someone else, so we were relocated to a tiny little room. It was quite warm so we tried to use the air-conditioner but it didn't work despite assurances it would ""soon"". So we spent time on the rooftop terrace where the service was excellent. Breakfast was also excellent!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2017,5,The Best of the Best!!,"The staff and accommodations surpassed my expectations. Thanks to the great staff our stay in Morocco was excellent. The riad was beautiful,romantic and authentic. You feel like you belong ther from the moment since you ended this majestic place. You are greeted with mint tea and pastries then taken to your room each room is different and beautifully decorated great size, beautiful bathrooms with foot standing tubs. The breakfast is upstairs in the terrace outdoors or in this very luxurious dining room. Nawal went out of her way for us all the time. She was the best hostess. Thank you, Julie",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2017,3,"Nice riad, but not the one advertised","When we arrived at the Dar El Kebira hotel, were were told that we had a room at ""Dar El Kebira 2"" and were escorted to another hotel a few streets away, where we seemed to be the only guests. The hotel was a fine traditional riad, but the decor was nothing like what I chose based on the photos. We had paid an upgrade for a deluxe room with a bathtub, but the room we were given had a tiny bathroom and only a shower stall. It didn't seem right at all. My husband managed to sleep, but I didn't, in part because I was kept up by the smell of the furniture (apparently freshly varnished) and the sheets, which were some of the roughest I can recall anywhere. The staff at the hotel was very helpful and professional during our two-day stay and the hostess was sympathetic when I‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2017,5,A lovely Riad,"When we arrived at the Riad we were somewhat surprised to see that our booking for a triple room for 3 single men comprised queen bed & a single. This was unacceptable, our hosts were really obliging & quickly found us an additional room in another Riad, at no cost to us. The fault lay with the tour operator & not the Riad. A traditional dinner & breakfast on the terrace was delightful.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2017,5,The best service in Morocco so far,Everyone was so nice and hospitable. They gave us recommendations for places to go. They even gave us a ride!! So happy to have met our hosts and stayed here even for one night. My family and I took so many photos here just to remember the wonderful memories.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2017,5,"Stunning home, definitely five a five star experience!","The Riad was really easy to find, sitting just off the Main Street that runs through the old medina, so we had no problems making our own way there! Upon entering the Riad we were blown away by the traditional Moroccan details that adorned the courtyard and received a warm welcome from the staff, who served us tea and dried fruits and were available around the clock to answer any questions we had! The room was cosy and well equipped with everything we could need and was the perfect retreat to a long day exploring the city and we were welcomed each morning on the roof terrace to a breakfast full of local and seasonal produce and could enjoy coffee with a view as the sun rose over the medina, which was a really special highlight! The management and hosts went above and beyond‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2017,4,A week in the Medina,Lovely and helpful staff. Location characterful. The whole interior decor was beautiful and authentic. Terrace excellent in summer. Food and room a little disappointing considering our expectations and the price. Rooms felt a little claustrophobic if you didn't have an outside window. Glass (room) door opened on to a public gallery.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2017,5,Lovely Riad in the heart of the Medina,"We spent 2 nights at the Riad - it was beautiful - a lovely authentic Moroccan tiled courtyard where we were warmly greeted with mint tea and pastries. The staff was very attentive and accommodating - they started breakfast for us at 7:30 one morning upon request, which required staff to begin their day earlier. The room was spacious with a large private bathroom. The food at dinner and breakfast was plentiful and excellent. And Moroccan wine is available as well. I would return to this Riad in the future, I highly recommend Dar El Kebira.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2017,4,Well appointed Riad in Rabat,This is quiet gentle Riad just off the Medina. Excellent roof terrace for breakfast and a good dining room. Our room was quiet and well-appointed. Easy parking nearby although quite difficult to find !!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2017,5,A warm welcome in the Medina,"We stayed in this Riad on two separate visit to Rabat during the same holiday at the beginning and again at the end. Amina Khayou was extremely gracious and helped us with anything needed (restaurants, sight seeing, car service, etc. ) as well as going out of her way to secure services at the best prices. Amina and her staff have created a customer experience that includes comfy beds and hot steamy showers, beautiful surroundings, delicious breakfast, and a generous, professional, warm service style that makes you feel at home. This is not only a luxury Riad, you are surrounded by people who sincerely care. I highly recommend without hesitation Riad Dar El Kebira as a lovely, peaceful retreat from the hectic, colorful and exciting souk at its doorstep.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2017,4,Gorgeous Riad...,"I really enjoyed my stay at Riad el Kebira, it was my favourite Riad in all of Morocco. The property is gorgeous, rooms well appointed, and staff is incredibly courteous and friendly. Breakfast was a multi - course delicious extravaganza. One minor comment is that the wifi was really weak in my room, but was working fine in lobby and rooftop. Would highly recommend and will definitely be back.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2017,5,Great Stay,"Great Stay, excellent service, breakfast was great, great location, Wifi service was great, In will recommended even though it is a Riad it was easy to find it. The service in getting help with the luggage and parking is great.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2017,4,Hidden gem in the Medina,I had a wonderful stay in this gorgeous riad. The personal is very friendly and help out smoothly when there was a problem with the heating. I was upgraded to a bigger room to compensate a chilly night.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2017,5,"Comfortable, convenient Riad","This Riad is conveniently located in the Medina with an easily remembered route in and out, unlike some we have stayed in !. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. They changed out room as didn't think I would manage the stairs in the duplex - having seen them they were correct! The rooms were comfortable, with towels, dressing gowns and toiletries available, which is handy when only bringing hand luggage. Bottled water and fruit was replenished everyday in our room. The duty manger was very knowledgeable about the area, and provided a map and should us places we should visit. Would definitely return",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2017,5,Excellent service,"Dinner was delicious 3 course Moroccan fare for 280 mad. Additional tea for 2 pax and still water at 100 mad. A tad expensive but well worth it. Service from all the staff was top notch. They provide Havaianas, bath robes, nice toiletries, tissue paper in the rooms, which some other hotels don't. Sumptuous breakfast spread on rooftop terrace was a joy! A very pleasant visit!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2017,4,Nice place,"The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk into the medina which means your car cant go in. U have to call the hotel and they will send someone to get u. If u can't climb stairs and u don't get one of the two rooms on the main floor u have a slight problem. Breakfast is also up on the top floor. Whether they will serve u on the main floor, I don't know. The breakfast was not bad, decent though not a lot of food. My room was a nice size. My biggest problem was the tub and shower. The tub is dangerous as there is no non slip tape here. Also when using the hand held nozzle to shower, the curtain is right on you which is kind of skeevy. They need to correct that. Service was excellent I may add.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2017,5,Great stay with delicious food,"After a week in Fe's , we arrived late to Rabat, we had a problem to park our car until the man from the hotel come to lead us to the right area , the old medina was dark at night with a narrow streets but as the man said it's so safe to have a walk The entrance was so beautiful with a big door ,traditional design and magical architecture inspired of Moroccans history. It was so calm at night we had a suite on the first floor with superb bathroom with too many windows that i really loved it. On the morning we had a Moroccan breakfast it was too much for 2 person but it was lovely After a special visit to the kasbah then we had lunch near to the ocean we turned back to our hotel . We having a drinks on the terrace for a couple of minutes then we go‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2016,5,Hooray for porters! And breakfast on rooftops! Beware parking scams,"We stayed in the La Souissi room, which was laid out a little strange...it was long and skinny. I'm guessing it was to hug the outside walls of the riad. The shower here is a clawfoot tub with a shower curtain, that I'm not really a fan of. They spoke very good English at the riad. Breakfast was served up on the rooftop terrace (so bring sunglasses) and the wait staff was very attentive. They are also able to do same day laundry if you drop off by 8am. We added on the 1/2 day tour to our package. It was a good tour but it was more like 2hrs instead of a 1/2 day. The tour guide did drive us to his favorite ""locals"" spot for lunch. The walk back from there was an easy 30min. We also added the hammam and massage to our stay. If you are male, its a little bit different‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

 January 2017,5,New Year visit to Morocco,"Dar El Kebira is an excellent riad. The interiors are stunning, it is well located on the edge of the Medina for easy access, and the level of service, in particular, was fantastic, with very attentive house and restaurant staff. Ismael, in the roof top kitchen and who served breakfast, is a great guy. Would highly recommend this riad.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2016,5,Relaxing stay,We are still here but had to post about our visit so far . The time we have been here has been so enjoyable and relaxing . Will come back again when we travel back this way . The staff are so very helpful from the manager Amina to the cleaners . We were told of places to see by Amina and how to get there which made it so much easier . We had dinner one night which was very good . Always enjoyed the breakfast our waiter Email looked after us so well . Would have eaten more times in Riad but wanted to explore . A must place to stay .,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2016,2,Not worth the money,"We stayed here for a few days while in Rabat for work. I started out with an open mind after reading all the reviews, but they are warranted. The manager absolutely has an attitude problem and poor customer service skills. We stayed in the Marbas (sp?), and it was not ideal. The bed was tiny and incredibly uncomfortable, the shower clogged, the bathroom smelled moldy/mildewy, the room was very narrow, the satellite tv didnt work, the wifi barely worked in the room. We informed the staff that the TV wasn't working on the first night, and they said someone would be there in 30 minutes to fix the issue. That never happened. The wifi worked on the terrace, but not in the room. We were offered an ""upgrade"" but the manager was never around to give it to us. She lives on the property‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2016,4,"Nice spa, quite small","In the very centre of old Medina, it's a very nice Riad, with a small Spa on the roof. Very nice hammam/scrub experience + strong/energizing massage. Nice view of the city from the roof garden (see attached pictures!)",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2016,4,Lovely riad,"Dar El Kebira is hidden in the corner of the medina, but with easy access to a main street for taxis and walking. It's just over the hill from the beach and across the street from the gorgeous Kasbah les Oudaias. In the other direction, it's easy to get lost winding through the narrow streets of the medina, but great fun and a wonderful place for souvenirs and local items. The colorful furnishings of the riad are captivating and even though the drawer handles fall off sometimes, you don't really mind because it's all so charming. The bed is a bit hard but again, you're in this lovely room with tile and drapes everywhere. If you want a window you have to ask for one, otherwise you'll never know what's going on outside of your little cave. Is the sun up? Is it raining? Your may‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2016,5,Arab Delight,"This Riad is tucked away in the Medina in Rabat. Once you find your way around you realise that it's not too far off the beaten track. We stayed in a large suite which had beautiful original furnishings. Breakfast was served on the roof terrace and provided a delicious selection of fresh fruit, crepes, cheese, olives and bread rolls.Unlimited coffee and cooked eggs available on request. The restaurant for evening meals was based in the downstairs salon which was furnished with beautifully decorated bench style seating and cushions. The main shopping area which caters for every taste in food, carpets, trinkets and leatherware is about five minutes away in the narrow medina streets.

 August 2016,3,First Riad in Morocco - 29 August 2016,"This is a nice Riad, the Hostess was a little rough but I think this is just her personality, whilst the young man who assists her was so gentle and kind and happy to assist in any way possible.

 September 2016,4,"Perfect location, delicious food, helpful staff","the staff was helpful from the moment we arrived. They even helped us call or rental car company to sort out an issue. It was an easy walk around the souk, to the Casbah and down to the ocean. The room was fantastic and the dinner we ordered one night was some of the best food we had in morocco. I still dream about the breakfast!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2016,4,"Friendly, welcoming staff. Great location in the souq. Traditional Riad",The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are quite small but there are options to up grade to the larger room types. All the rooms are unique and eclectic and are authentic Moroccan in d√©cor and style. The location is fabulous but if travelling alone I wouldn‚Äôt suggest not walking to and from the markets alone at night as the alley ways are small and a little daunting. Breakfast is traditional Moroccan served on their rooftop which gives a good view over the city.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2016,5,Amazing,I stayed at Dar El Kebira near the end of August and I had an amazing experience. Amina was amazing and helpful. I would suggest that anyone visiting Rabat should stay here. When we arrived we were greeted with a cup of tea and suggestions of things to see in the city. The first night we ordered from the Riad and the food was amazing Thanks Hotel staff for everything,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2016,3,Mixed Results,"Our stay at Dar El Kebira was a mix of good and disappointment. Here's the breakdown: Pros: - Pretty, decorative riad - Good location near Oudayas Kasbah, Rue des Consuls (main shopping pedestrian street), Le Dhow (docked boat for late night drinks), and access to cabs (more on cabs below) - Good breakfast, which is pleasant on the terrace if it's not too hot. - Nice and courteous staff Cons: - Manager at check-in and check-out seems to mean well, but she comes across as gruff and non-inviting. Quite a contrast from almost every other hotel manager or employee we met over our 9 days in Morocco. Also, she was never around over the course of our stay and it was difficult at times to find someone if we needed something. - The hotel arranged for our car transport to the‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2016,4,"Unique, clean, safe","Yes, of course, Rabat has the chain hotels which will make you feel like you have not left home, but who wants that, really? The Riad DeK is intimate, old and charming. It is located in a quiet corner of the Medina. The staff is helpful and very proud of their place. Surely, there are things to complain about but only if you thought you were checking into a traditional hotel. Otherwise, go and enjoy! The wifi worked great and the breakfast plentiful.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2016,5,Great place to stay in Rabat,"Dar el Kebira is in a great location -- just inside the medina across from the Oudayas...close enough to walk to souiqa and downtown if you want, and close to all the river/beach sites as well -- excellent breakfast, too!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2016,4,"Great Staff, Imploite Management","The staff was exceptional. Kind, welcoming, friendly, and they went out of their way to be incredibly helpful at every turn. I wish I could say about the manager, but I cannot. The manager was very cold and explicitly transactional. The woman (I hate that I forgot her name) that greeted us on Monday morning was kind enough initially, but once it was time to settle the bill...she was short and insistent and not very friendly. A few examples: 1.) Perhaps she was frustrated because the hot water was not working that morning and maintenance personnel were in her office hurriedly trying to fix it. But, instead of apologizing for that and not letting your customers see you sweat, she was very short and rushed me along. 2.) On my first day, I had some complications with travel‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2016,5,Great stay,"Great service. Staff are professional and friendly. Couldn't ask more of them. They welcomed us with a nice cup of tea, helped us navigate the Medina (even handed us a map) and gave instructions where to park our rental car (and how much we should expect to pay for it). Rooms are small but cosy. They have all the comfort you need. They are not as fancy as rest of the building, though. But we didn't mind. Breakfast on the roof terrace is magical and shouldn't be skipped. We didn't eat diner here, so can't comment on that.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2016,5,Excellent Place- Highly Recommend. You will not be sorry,"4 of us stayed for 3 nights at El Kebira May 17-20th. Wow... it was the highlight of our 3 week vacation throughout Europe and Morocco. Wonderful staff... Great rooms, ambiance, outstanding service. The breakfast on the roof terrace is delicious and so fresh. We cannot speak more highly of this accommodation. Beautiful and terrific. We did purchase a dinner for (4) one evening from the hotel and it was just ok.. We were also disappointed in that we missed having a hamman and massage as they only have (1) person doing this and we could not be accomodated. When in Rabat, you must stay at the Dar El Kebira... Thank you for wonderful memories!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2016,5,Beautiful Riad in Rabat,"I travelled through Morocco for 2 weeks, Riad Dar el Kebira stood out as a wonderful little gem in the heart of the Medina. Rabat was easy to navigate and explore without a guide. We enjoyed the Riad, staff, accommodation and service. The roof top terrace could do with a make over to encourage the use of such a beautiful space overlooking the old city. I would highly recommend this road as an authentic Moroccan experience.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2016,5,Magical stay!,"I find this Riad magical, there is so much love to detail all around it! It transports you to the real moroccan way of living.

I will definitely come back!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2016,5,An Exquisite Riad in the Rabat Medina,"We stayed at Dar El Kebira for 11 days and have nothing but glowing remarks about the Riad and the entire staff. The Riad was a welcome sanctuary from the narrow passageways and crowds of the Rabat Medina. We stayed in a larger room that had a seating area and it was very comfortable. It was immaculately kept clean every day by a friendly and welcoming staff. Breakfasts on the rooftop terrace was served in a relaxed manner and was a great way to start the day. We used the Riad as a base for day trips to Fes and Casablanca and an overnight trip to Marrakech, but came back to Dar El Kebira and felt at home.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2016,4,"Good service, specially by mr. Youness, at dinner and roomservice","the hotel is beautiful inside, the room was great, but taking a shower in the bath was not easy to get in and out, or to stand without a grip. to reach the hotel at night is not easy with a lot of luggage. it is recommended to order a shuttle from the airport to the hotel.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2016,3,Review of Riad Dar El Kebira,We stayed at this Riad at both the beginning and the end of our 11 day trip to Morocco when we came to visit our daughter. The location of the Riad was convenient to getting about. The two gentlemen that assisted us at the hotel were welcoming. The rooftop was comfortable and the breakfast was nice. We asked for a cab to pick us up at the airport and it was waiting for us when we arrived. The down side of this Riad is the unfriendly hotel manager. She was abrupt in every conversation and in most cases unhelpful. We asked if she could arrange for a driver to take us to a location in the north. She told us it would be too expensive and that we should go and check out the bus. One evening we asked her if she could make change for us as we had to take a cab and we only had large‚Ä¶,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Great Riad,This Riad surpassed all my exceptions. The staff were all so helpful and made our stay such a pleasure. The Riad is tucked away in the Medina in such a quiet part of the city but with easy access. We had dinner in the Riad twice and enjoyed both meals. Would have no hesitation in recommending the Dar el Keira.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Excellent Hospitality at this beautiful Riad,"We stayed at this beautiful Riad for 2 nights, with our kids and wish we had stayed a bit more. Interior is done beautifully, the breakfast was a treat everyday and their in house dinner which we tried one night was truly remarkable. The staff is very friendly, very accommodating, and generally helpful. All our needs were immediately taken care of which included a late night request for hot chocolate for my kids(and it came with complimentary biscotti). We came back with beautiful memories. Highly recommend this if you are planning a Riyad experience in Rabat",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

 April 2016,5,Lovely Riad in Rabat Medina,"We had a wonderful two-night stay here. They sent a car for us to the Casablanca Airport, and staff met us on the street and led us to the riad. The signs were easy to gfollow, so we could have walked on our own. The breakfasts on the roof were delightful, and the dinner in the riad was delicious. The riad is located close to the kasbah, historic gates, and the beach. We will return here soon.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2016,5,"Lovely, relaxing Riad",The riad is located within the medina and an easy walk to most locations. 20 minute walk from the train station. The roof top terrace is set up with both indoor and outdoor spaces suited for all weather. A lovely space for breakfast and a bottle of wine in the evening. The riad is beautifully decorated on each floor and the staff was always available to assist as needed. A lovely stay.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2016,4,It's a palace,"There really isn't a better word than ""sumptuous"" to describe this place. Remember all those French chateaus and palaces you saw with beautiful chairs and tables and marble and mosaics all kept behind velvet ropes and ""don't touch"" signs? That's the furniture in your main rooms. Have a seat. The location is good, easy walking distance to the Kasbah and just about everything else. The souk is right there and it's much more genteel than, say, Marrakesh. Don't miss breakfast on the roof, and just for fun, walk up the back stairs. Even the back stairs are beautiful.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2016,4,A sumptuously decorated Riad the way it should be,"Small but richly decorated room with a good bathroom and bed. Very nice common sitting and dining room at the ground floor, and likewise a very nice lounge and brakfast area on the top floor. Friendly staff offering good but somewhat slow service. I found the charges for the room, the dinner and especially the wine quite high but I have not checked if these were exceptional or normal rates in Rabat.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2016,5,absolutely stunning,"I've traveled the world, independently for 40 years....this is the real deal. If you want to stay in a totally authentic, charming riad with wonderful service, stay here. I guess the people who gave less than steller reviews need a more ""modern"" hotel. If you want to feel what it may have been like to live in one of these marvelous homes, stay here.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2016,4,Nice place- helpful staff,"We enjoyed our stay at this beautifully restored home, and had two dinners as well, which were pricey but tasty enough. The rooms are small- there isn't a lot of room to open a couple of suitcases. Also, the small shower took about an hour to fully drain. Although it's in the heart of the medinah, signs from the nearby medinah entrance make it easy to find. Choose a room away from the street if you want to avoid noise from conversations outside and motorbikes.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2016,2,Not very happy there.,"It actually is a pretty little riad but for the money and what we got, we were not happy. The room we got was for 3 people, two could sleep upstairs and the third in a tiny little space downstairs. The room smelt funny like it had mold or dampness, loads of stains in the bathroom, it was old and worn. Good point was a nice little rooftop place to eat breakfast, we enjoyed that. Location is not great, thru a lot of backstreets and it was a bit scary really.But we only stayed one night so it was not too bad but I would never recommend a longer stay.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2016,4,Imdad Raja,beautiful place to stay with lovely staff always willing to help with anything you need. I had a fantastic stay the rooms were well looked after and the location was good also near the marina bay beautiful weather just to top things up.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2016,3,Hit and miss,This was a mixed experience. Firstly the good things: it is ideally located near one of the entrances to the medina and near the kasbah and the corniche. So easy to get back and forth. The staff were very friendly. The upstairs outdoor/indoor terrace was a lovely spot to work (this was a business trip with some holiday time as well). But.... Firstly they changed the room I booked because I requested a fixed shower holder (they are almost all hand held except in the smaller rooms). But the wall attachment was useless and the bathroom ended up completely flooded. The chairs in the small narrow room were wooden with thin cushions which made them quite uncomfortable to sit on. So we asked to change rooms (for a fee) and we were shown the only other room available which was even‚Ä¶,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2016,5,True Medina Experience in a historic place,"Recommend for a Medina experience. We parked half a kilometer away and enjoyed a night, evening and morning walk. A staff accompanied at night for a walk. We enjoyed, room, wine, breakfast and were satisfied with the place, location.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2016,5,A taste of Rabat....,"A wonderful Moroccan experience. We didn't bother to leave for dinner as you can order in the morning after a rooftop breakfast and they will home cook the tagines to enjoy in their downstairs lounge and dining area. A must try if you want to feel the real taste of Morocco, the Riad experience is way different from a modern 4-5 star hotel which we can all experience anytime. There was TV, hot water and all the basic needs for 2 nights and my wife was happy for the experience. It was something to remember....",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2016,5,Best Riad in Medina,"Excellent service for the entire 2 weeks period, the hospitality of the staff is outstanding and perfectly balanced. Hanane makes the best breakfast in Rabat even for lactose intolerant. The location is great, I was jogging on the beach every morning. Room service is very good, so highly recommended.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2016,4,Stylish and decent enough riad,"This is a stylish riad in a great location within the medina, well sign-posted, and a short walk away from the main soukh. The staff are fantastically helpful, and the breakfasts on the terrace were wonderful even if not the very best we have enjoyed in Marrakech. We thought the evening meal was decent and the offer of wine was welcome but it was probably appropriately judged as decent but not exceptional food. The room we had was somewhat cramped and I thought that overall it was probably a little expensive for what was on offer.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2016,4,"Great location, beautiful","This is a beautiful riad in a great location easily accessible by car with a parking lot a few blocks away. We had a suite on the 2nd floor which was beautfully decorated, a nice size and had modern amenities in bathroom. Close to the Kasbah and Andalusian gardens. We woke up to the smell of fresh bread from the bakery across the street. Food and wine was great in restaurant. Check-in wasn't very welcoming but not rude in any way. It was just very tactical compared to the other places we stayed on our trip through Morocco. Maybe because it was late in the evening, around 9pm and they wanted to go home. The server did however let us stay in the lounge pretty late after our dinner since we arrived so late and wanted to unwind with another bottle of wine after our long car‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2016,5,Great Hotel!,"Stay here to feel like a part of Rabat. The custom design and decorations are fantastic. Go for the Hammam spa treatment, it was quite the experience. Be prepared, the rooms are long but narrow, that is just the style of many Riads, but some Westerners would find it small if you are use to big square rooms.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2015,4,Lovely Riad located deep in the Medina. Very Authentic,"Our room was beautifully decorated, smallish but fitted into the building well, to have made the rooms larger would have meant alterations which would have taken away not added to the experience. The staff put themselves out and go the extra mile to ensure you, their guests, enjoy your stay. The riad is actually quite easy to find from the Kasbah les Oudaias. How helpful of the porter to point out all the signs on our 5 mins walk from the manned parking area through the medina! Breakfast was very nice and served on the rooftop terrace. We loved Rabat, much less touristy than Marrakech, Agadir or Essaouira with plenty to see all within a short walk of the riad. I would highly recommend a stay at Riad Dar El Kebira you wont be disappointed. We had some initial issues with‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2015,5,THE place to stay in Rabat,"This place is absolutely the best. I stayed there over the Christmas holiday and used pretty much all their services and amenities including pick up from Rabat airport/ drop off in Casa, their restaurant, the hammam/ massage, etc and everything was truly amazing. Staff is welcoming and makes you feel at home. I had a warm welcome with complementary Moroccan tea by Yassir after the easy trip from the airport to the riad. I had told them in advance that I wanted to eat there upon arrival since I was getting in late and the kitchen was ready. I had a pastilla and my first chicken with lemon and olive tajine in Morocco and they were both great. Note, they do serve wine and beer in the restaurant and in the lobby. Moroccan breakfast is served in their beautifully done rooftop with‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2015,4,"Charming riad, good location, great service","Tucked away on a narrow alley in the medina, you will find this very beautiful riad. It being our first night in Morocco, I cannot make comparisons to other Moroccan accommodations but the staff were so friendly and helpful, you'll feel like you're being treated royally. The common spaces are quite beautiful. Our suite was large and comfy. Elaborately decorated. Nice toiletries and towels. Mattress was a bit firm, lighting was dim and English TV channels limited (but we didn't care). Each suite is unique and ornate. Dinner was pretty good but service surpassed the food. While we arrived too late to preorder couscous, they served us some from another guests order. My wife's chicken was a bit dry, but she was pleased to be served two styles rather than having to choose. My‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2015,5,"Full of character, great service, and ideal location","This riad in the heart of the medina was perfect for us. It's a very charming historic building that evokes Arabian Nights. The staff were always helpful and we enjoyed the tasty breakfast on the rooftop. It was a great location for exploring both the medina and the casbah. The price was reasonable and very good value, especially when compared to some of the soulless modern hotels. We had difficulty finding it when arriving at night, but only because we made the mistake of attempting to walk from the train station (a longish walk with luggage). Had we taken a taxi and approached it from the other side of the medina (nearer the casbah) we would have found the approach well sign-posted. We would definitely return to this hotel.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,4,Very good hotel but parking is not very easy,Hotel within the old city so you must park your car outside city and walk 5min. It is not very easy to find the hotel but you can ask local boys who will lead you to the hotel for a small tip. The room I had is quite small but the hotel has very good breakfast and location is very convenient for sightseeing,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,5,"Lovely quality, great service, good location, reasonable price.","Stayed here for 3 nights on our first visit to Morocco. The Riad is located in the heart of the city's old Medina, and surrounded by the rabbit warren of beautiful old walk ways and streets with their colourful little wooden fronted shops. It's also just a short walk to the Kasbah which has a lovely public garden (free) and serves traditional tea and sweets over looking the river and sea. The Riad has fairly small rooms, but their quite plush and its interior is traditional and charming with a few open fires. Breakfast is served up on a lovely open roof terrace overlooking the city. For what you get and the price, we found it a great place to start our Moroccan adventure. Highly recommended.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Excellent Traditional Riad set in the Medina,"We stayed here 4 nights this week and really enjoyed our stay, the Manager Amina and all her staff are very efficient and friendly. The rooms are small but very traditional and clean. The morning breakast is well worth having served on the terrace overlooking Rabat. We took dinner two evenings , the food wine and service could not be faulted. All in all a very nice place to stay in Rabat. First night arrival the Riad would be difficult to find, we used the Riad Taxi service and pleased that we did.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,5,My first choice in Rabat,The riad is amazing. Exceptionally beautiful. The bathroom was wonderful and the rooms are vey boutique. The service is first class and it is a vey safe part of town and very close to the souks. My only negative was a bit of dirt around the sink area and had we been staying longer I would have drawn attention to it but it wouldn't put me off staying again.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,3,Ok Hotel,This hotel is clean and beautiful but unfortunately noisy at day time. the service is not the best n but OK. I was there for 5 nights and the personal was very polite and helpful except one time. Compairing with the price I cannot say it is a 4 star hotel but it is clean and beautiful.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Charming traditional riad in the Medina,"My first night in Morocco, and one night stay at the Dar El Kebira. Beautiful building with original carving and wood architectural features. Very helpful staff who served wine and snacks on the rooftop. Wonderful views! Traditional antique furnishings throughout, and in my lovely bedroom on the ground floor. I had dinner in the Dar, and it was delicious.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,5,"Brand new cultural experience in Morocco, Africa.",We were sighted with the hotel managements help to organize taxi and train and taxi for a special trip 6 hours away. We could not have done it without them! Breakfast on their rooftop terrace was exceptional.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,5,well cared for at Riad Dar El kebira,"We were very impressed with our short hotel stay at Riad Dar El kebira. We felt safe (even though we did not speak any other language's) and were always greeted at the door by the concierge there are security camera's in place. We needed help with traveling to Chefchaousen,Morocco the concierge was able to give us in english very clear directions for the train and a reserved taxi in advance both ways, all are our connections were on time and smooth. We were allowed to leave our luggage and travel light for our trip. We returned and had a lovely room waiting for us with our luggage already in the room. We used the internet to check flights etc...when it came time to leave and again another the great taxi to the air port on our departure. All hotel staff were genuinely kind and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2015,5,Had a great time here!,"Both the staff and the hotel were great! Very exotic, different from any hotel I have stayed. If you are looking for a unique experience in morocco this will do it. Staff was very friendly and clean! Room was small but had everything that I needed. Also the food here was great. Really clean. Location was a little hard to find but there are signs in the streets that will guide you to the door.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,4,Romantic and genuine,"Very pleasent stay, perfect lokation, and very helpfull staff. Quite higly priced, compared to other riads! Extremely charming, eventhough it has seen better days.... Beds rather hard, but got a good night sleep anyway!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Excellent Riad in the heart of the old Medina!!!,"I recentely travelled to Rabat Morocco and I stayed at the Dar El Kebira Riad for just two nights, that was such a wonderful experience !!! A very nice Riad in the heart of the old Medina, with a very nice staff :) starting from the manager, a very nice professional lady to all the others, they just make you feel you're at home :) I booked a standard room and I got a deluxe room instead!! The design was breathtaking, makes you go back in time to the golden age ! The breakfast is served at the terace.... very yammyyy ;) I miss it already :(, I will definitely recommend it and will definitely comback again inshallah!!! Thanks for making my stay as confortable as possible :) see you very soon!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2015,4,Good base to explore Rabat,"After looking at a few choices on booking.com, we chose Dar Kebira for our two night stay in the last week of October. We were swayed by its handy location and the pictures of the d√©cor. Our room choice was the Pinede suite (Max Occupancy 3 ). Before arrival we emailed the Riad directly and requested for the airport transfer as well. Now to the review:- The airport transfer taxi was waiting at Rabat Sale as we arrived and whisked us straight to the Riad, a 20 minute journey the last section of which was along the waterfront. Being in the midst of the Medina , the narrow streets don‚Äôt allow drop off at the front door . Not a problem as the doorman had been given a heads up and he was waiting and walked us and our luggage through the narrow alleyways of the medina to the Riad‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2015,4,"Great Moroccan ambiance! Rooms were good, Food amazing, massages relaxing!",We stayed here for only one night at the end of a long trip. Unfortunately our train was delayed coming in so we didn't have a lot of time in the medina. The location is a little confusing so it's important to have someone come get you from the street! Even though we saw photos on tripadvisor the room was way smaller than it looked! It was nicely decorated and ours had a little loft. I took a look at the other rooms and noticed that they were not as nicely decorated on the inside as other riads. However the lobby and dinning experience makes up for it!! Excellent food and service from Youness! Our massages on the top floor were excellent and classic moroccan. The terrace is really nicely decorated but the views are nothing spectacular...in fact a little awkward being close‚Ä¶,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2015,4,"Nice facility, great location","The Riad has an ambience that brings you back in time, a perfect environment for the Rabat Medina in which it is located. The rooms can be awkward but that's because of the old style layout of the building. Dinner was out of this world good, perhaps the best food we had on our trip. Only downsides were (1) we were bumped from the Riad on our second night and had to relocated to a less-than-desirable facility nearby and (2) the lamps are not grounded and my wife received a 220 volt electric shock (she's OK). We would go back but would double check to ensure we have a room throughout our stay.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2015,5,Great stay,"Dar el Kebira is a gem in the Rabat medina. Classic Moroccan taste, superb location with a decent view. Very nice breakfast and amenities, did not try the lunch or dinner. Will definitely stay there again inshallah",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2015,5,Fantastic place,"This riad is in the heart of the Kasbah in Rabat, very safe to get to and easy to find. We stayed in the room el bouregreg, very clean, excellent service, every little detail is well thougt of and the decoration is so exotic. Beautiful breakfast on the terrasse, very good food. Cannot believe how nice everybody was, there is a hammam and massage in the riad that is available, tried both, highly recommended. A lot of things to visit within walking distance, loved this place and loved Rabat, would go back there without any hesitation, well worth it!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2015,5,"Authentic Charm, Generous Hosts","I used to live in Morocco, so I have some experience with service norms in the country. Riad Dar El Kebira is exactly where you want to go to experience the charm and mystique of the Orient with the comfort of Western hospitality. Amina and her staff are authentic, genuine, and generous in their service. You will feel more like you are visiting with family than staying in a stuffy hotel (which is much more expensive). The Riad itself is lovely. Located in the middle of the old city (the Medina), you are located near everything you want to see, be it the old Kasba or the fantastic souk (market). I can promise you that the prices in the Rabat souk are better than any other place in Morocco, so this is the place to buy all of the wonderful items on offer. If you are‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2015,4,Beautiful Riad,Beautiful Riad in the Medina. Rooms are very nice and clean. Lovely breakfast on the terrace. Dinner was excellent but pricey and is a good option if you're tired or if it is late to venture outside. Walking distance to the Kasbah Oudaias. Friendly and helpful staff.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2015,5,Great place to stay!!!,"We enjoyed 3 days and nights in Riad Dar El Kebira and we has a nice days. Once we came inside,everything was perfect. Nice arquitechture,kind and warm hosting. Rooms are amazing,good and tasty breakfast and a great service from the crew,specially Simmohamed,kind regards! I highly recommend this Riad for your days in Rabat. Good trips!!!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2015,4,Good Riad in the Medina,"This is a good place to stay in Rabat if you want the medina experience. It is small, well-maintained Riad that is a few twisting streets away from the entrance to the Kasbah. The breakfast is fine, if a bit repetitive after a few days. We also had dinner once, as most places were closed for Ramadan, but it was basic standard-issue Moroccan tangine. The rooms seemed a bit cramped and dark, though we got two of the largest, but for the price, the hotel is a relative bargain.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2015,5,Wedding photo shoot,The staff welcomed us and allowed us access to all areas for our photo shoot. Our room was prepared very well and the service was very professional Thank you dar el kebira for a wonderful evening for our wedding photos!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2015,4,Amazing service in a beautiful Riad,"Amazing service upon arrival until the end, the staff gave us a map and showed us where to go and the best way to explore the city. The staff was attentive and very helpful. The riad is authentic and beautiful. We stayed in a suite upstairs which was perfect and quiet. I didn't love having a bathtub as a shower and the they could definite update the blanket used on the bed. Overall our stay was wonderful!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2015,5,A Great Service Hotel,this is a great place because of its location. the hotel also makes you feel like staying in a house during your trip. the service is amazing from the hotel manager to Younes and Mohammed. the only thing i did not quite like is that you have to pay cash for hotel taxes and food and drinks consume in the hotel. we would have wanted to have more of our meals and drank more in the comfort of the hotel to relax at the end of the day. but with the cash system we were forced to eat out where credit card is accepted. unfortunately for the establishment they could have made more from us if they accepted credit cards. but everything else is great.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2015,3,Decent choice for Rabat Medina,"Compared to the riads we stayed at in Marrakech and Fes, this one was overpriced for its accommodations. The rooms are small and a bit stuffy. Our bathroom had it's fair share of ants and other crawling things. However, the rooftop terrace and other common spaces are very nice. Breakfast was standard Moroccan fare. Dinner at the restaurant was very good but somewhat pricey.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2015,3,Not a 5* by any stretch of the imagination,Hard to find and I never get lost anywhere in the world. I'm not afraid to ask for instructions and I had pre-printed instructions. Not even close to 5* accommodations. The room had a funky smell the claw foot tub was not bolted to the floor so if you moved out the middle it would tip up. We stayed at a riad in Marrackesh that meet all of the 5* accommodations western travelers expect (they are not on expedia). Try something else.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Great location,"If you are looking for a Riad to explore Rabat this is well located in the Medina and a short walk from the Kasbah. We initially stayed in one of the smaller rooms which was cosy and quiet and on our return from Tangier stayed in a suite which was wonderfully appointed and worth the additional cost. A substantial Moroccan breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace. Rabat is a fascinating city and while not always considered a tourist destination worth exploring. Thanks Amina, Yassir and all the staff for your wonderful Moroccan hospitality, we are looking forward to our next visit.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2015,3,Lovely riad in the heart of the medina,"We loved this riad! Overall, it was a great location but the staff was not very present. It was pricey for the experience but the room was comfortable, the location central and the terrace had a fantastic view.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,5,Fantastic stay at a beautiful Riad,We had a wonderful stay at this Riad. The decor is very tastefully done and is simply stunning. We couldn't get over taking pictures of the Riad! The rooms are small but comfortable which is not unexpected considering its a traditional home. The bathrooms are very nicely done as well. The location is perfect as its in the Medina and you can walk to all attractions. The hospitality is really good. Both Amina and Mohammed were very obliging. We had booked a trip to Fes via the Riad which went off very well. The food and ambiance is excellent. The breakfast is very good.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2015,2,Surprisingly Poor,"The pictures looked great; the reviews looked better. But the Riad did not live up to those expectations. My room was very small. It was also noisy as it looked directly outwards onto the alleys of the Medina. There was nowhere to put my clothes, except a small cupboard to hang things. I know there were lots of rooms free in the Riad, so I have no idea why I was put into this room. It was not cheap, so was pretty poor value for money. Disappointing.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Overnight in Dar El Kebira,"I had already heard about this Riad, I was told that it is one of very few in Rabat with a beautiful traditional decoration. And when I first entered I realised that it was even more beautiful than in the photos. But when I spent the night I found that also everything has been caarefully placed in such a way that you would always find what you're looking for. Beautiful experience. I certainely recomend it. Ahh .. forget to tell you that breakfast in the terrace with the view of the Medina and in the horizon the ocean ... was delicious!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Rabat Visit,We stayed at Riad Dar El Kebira for the second time in 6 months. It was again a wonderful experience. The Riad is located in the Medina and very convenient to local sights. The staff were all fabulous and very accommodating. From booking restaurants to airport transfers and sightseeing trips they did an excellent job and everyone was so generous and friendly. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Rabat. Their restaurant was excellent with high quality authentic Moroccan food. Breakfast was served on the Terrace and was perfect. Our rooms were furnished in traditional Moroccan decor with all the modern conveniences included. We will definitely return to Dar el Kebira the next time we are in Rabat. It is important to note that credit cards can be used to pay for the‚Ä¶,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,5,Awesome Experience!,"This riad is fantastic. This visit was my first time to Morocco, or anywhere in that part of the world for that matter. The place was easy to find, but be aware you will walk down a couple of well-marked narrow streets in the Medina. The front door is just a plain non-descriptive door, so knock on the door below the sign. Amina, the manager, was very welcoming and offered me the traditional Moroccan mint tea, dates and almonds when I entered. My room was super and very comfortable. The location is great for exploring the Medina and near-by sights. The food was super...no complaints what so ever. I definitely would stay there again!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,4,it's a luxury ryad with its defaults,"Before sleeping in a Ryad, you have to know that a ryad is very noisy and also wet. Alas, as in other ryads, the internal noise made by people walking or taking breakfast is waking up everybody... So forget about sleping to 10AM or take your ear plugs!! Should be good to have some noise policy‚Ä¶ Our room was also very wet because the bathroom doesn't have enough fresh air... Walls are retaining water :-( The service and breakfast are great. Nice people except the waiter being a little bit arrogant, telling us that breakfast was served until 10am and not later. Also telling us that we haven‚Äôt pushed the right button for the bell but he was sleeping somewhere backwards: we pushed the right button and heard the bell 4 times and had to call the Ryad. So this is why I'm only putting‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2015,4,very nice and confortable,"Very nice interiors. Comfortable, elegant and quiet stay, even though some more fresh air in the room would be desirable. The terrace is very relaxing. Friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast ok. A buffet would be better than personal servings.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2015,3,Very nice for a stopp over,"We stayed there on our way to Marrakech and it was nice. The staff was very kind, dinner (a little too expensive) was good, breakfast also. The room had TV, wifi and air con, and was of course beautiful designed. Would go here again. People in the medina were also very kind.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2015,4,Pleasent and comfortable!,"The staff were extremely pleasent and helpful. The room was very well accommodated. I have to say that throughout my visit to Morocco Dar El Kebira was good value, however I was not blown away. I had stayed in much better in other places in Morocco.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,3,"very friendly, helpful staff","Although I was very well received, I would not return to this riad. I have visited quite a few all over Morocco and this one is just okay but not outstanding. What I really did not like was the very strong mouldy smell all over the place. There is definitely a problem with airing the rooms, my clothes even felt slightly humid. I also think they quite overdid the oriental decor, a bit less would have been more. And after my stay I felt really harassed by their constant reminders to leave a review. So here it is, not overly positive but honest.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2014,5,Great Riad in the center of Rabat,"Stayed here for a night, great place to explore Rabat from with excellent staff. Nicely decorated, comfortable and worth the visit. It is easy to find by following the signs in the Medina. Would go back!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,2,Not quite up to the mark,"We stayed a night on a tour of Morocco. The welcome was friendly enough, the room quite clean and comfortable. but that was it. The room was a tad narrow (to be fair, that is not uncommon in riads located in medinas). The tub was dangerously narrow - one had to balance oneself precariously while taking a shower. While leaving, we were told brusquely that we would have to pay in cash, even though they accept reservations by credit card. I would not recommend this place - there are surely better options available.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,5,THE Place to Stay in Rabat!,"Romantic surroundings and impeccable service are the best ways to describe this Riad. Although we arrived later than expected, the caring staff made us feel welcomed as though we were their first clients of the day. They even arranged a late meal that was amazing, and they never made us feel rushed. The location is excellently placed to explore the surrounding Medina and various parts of the city. They arranged for an excellent private tour led by the extremely knowledgeable and proud local, Mr Fadel, whom is a MUST if you have limited time in Rabat. This is Moroccan hospitality at its finest--would highly recommend this for any visitor!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,5,An exquisitely beautiful place to stay,"We spent a few nights in the Riad Dar El Kebira and found it to be a very comfortable, quiet and attractive place to stay. The rooms, furniture and antique furnishings were lovely. The place is kept spotlessly clean. The food (and Moroccan wine) were extremely good, and vegetarians were well catered for. The staff were very helpful and efficient. The service was exemplary. However, we were surprised that smoking appears to be tolerated in certain parts of the hotel. And, if you are planning a special occasion, be aware that the price of champagne in Morocco now appears to be astronomically expensive, even by the standards of multi-star hotels. The hotel's website gives room prices in euros only. But those prices seemed to be a little out of date, because you are billed in‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,5,Stylish Riad in the centre of Rabat,We were welcomed to the Riad Dar El Kebira with some mint tea and a friendly face which was very welcome after a slightly arduous journey from the station to the Riad. Dar El Kebira is ideally placed in the Rabat Medina right next to the main shopping street and just a short walk to the beach views - you couldn't really ask for a better location as a visitor to Rabat. We were lucky enough to be upgraded and found that we had a very beautiful and large room which was stunningly decorated. The bedroom had a very nice bathroom with high quality soaps and we were also provided with drinking water and fruit in the room. From the room there was a little bit of noise from outside in the morning but in some ways it was nice to hear the hustle and bustle of Rabat outside. Aside from‚Ä¶,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2015,4,Great Stay @ Riad Dar El Kebira,Loved my stay at this place...Would recommend visitors in rabat looking for authentic architecture and something unique to book this riad! Rooms are great...Food was particulary Good...Location near the media...Staff was very attentive to our needs! Thank You so much for the great hospitality!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2015,5,A haven in Rabat,"Our first three days in Morocco we stayed in Dar El Kebira. It was a haven for us after flying many hours then driving from Casablanca. We were welcomed in to cool reception and served almonds, dates and mint tea before being taken to our rooms. The hotel is in the medina and an easy walk to the gorgeous waterfront, the Kasbar, and of course the many alley ways of the medina. Dinner at the hotel was a treat, and beautifully presented. Breakfasts up on the roof were exceptional with Mohammed's friendliness, warm welcome, impeccable service and generosity in sharing local details. Our rooms were authentic and the hotel tasteful and especially quiet at night.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2015,3,Overpriced,Half a cup of terrible lukewarm tea upon arrival. They didn't have the room we booked so without apology tried to give us an awful room for the same price. Nice Riad but not worth more than $70/night.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2014,5,Beautiful luxury in the medina of Rabat,"My husband and I spent a night at Dar El Kebira and what a wonderful experience. It started with the gracious greeting we received upon arrival including a tray of delicious Moroccan treats and mint tea, followed by our lovely room, and capped off with a delicious Moroccan dinner. The owners and staff were so friendly and kind; we felt like kings in a castle. The only downside, if one could call this a down side, is because the riad is located in the medina there is no easy or straightforward route to walk to find the riad. I must say, this just added to the mystique and experience. We stayed at several riads while traveling around Morocco, and the Dar El Kebira was our favorite.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2015,5,A great experience !,"I had a great time at Dar El Kebira, the property is simply wonderful and the hosts did a great job creating a peaceful and welcoming atmosphere. It is a great experience especially for tourists like me (all the way from cold montreal) as it is located in the heart of the medina of Rabat and I would greatly recommend this destination to anyone wanting to truly learn about the moroccan culture. The little souks inside the medina are very interesting to visit. At the riad, the rooms are comfortable and cozy. The staff portrays moroccan hospitality at its finest; they are very welcoming and available to suit your needs even late at night. It is just magestic waking up to a beautiful sun and having breakfast on the rooftop terrace, sipping warm moroccan mint tea, and enjoying a view‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2015,2,not super awesome,"Of the half dozen places we stayed on our trip to Morocco this was probably the second worst. The worst place had no hot water. It was certainly adequate and while not especially comfortable it was comfortable enough. I'm not generally an entitled, complainy person, but feel it necessary to warn travelers that this place is certainly not worth the over $200 a night they charged us. The room was cramped. There's nowhere to put your luggage. There is little privacy and quite a bit of street noise. The room we stayed in was stuffy, dim and dreary (there was barely enough light to read by). The claw-foot tub (sounds nice, right?) was small enough that I stumbled and fell when taking a small step backwards (my friend had the same experience--really, that could be quite dangerous).‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2015,4,A Pleasant Riad In Rabat,"This Riad has a convenient location in the Medina not far from the Kasbah. While the rooms are not as nice as in the photos (as another reviewer observed) and I would not call this a 5* hotel, it is nice and comfortable. We had rooms off the lobby on main floor. Both were comfortable and clean. We had both lunch and breakfast on the upstairs terrace. The views from the terrace on the top floor are great and the food was very good.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2015,5,"Beautiful interior, very comfortable Riad","Not too difficult to find and well positioned for the souqs, the Kasbah and the sea, this Riad was very comfortable. The welcome was fine and the Moroccan details of furnishing and decor were great. Our room had a 4 poster bed and the bathroom had a deep bath (we never did find the light switch though!). It was the only time during our holiday that we had a TV and comfortable seating area for viewing. We only spent 1 night here but it would warrant a longer stay, being a good base for Rabat's attractions and with a log fire and books for the winter evenings. The recommendation of a fish restaurant was disappointing, after quite a long walk to find it, and we were the only diners. Breakfast was excellent, served by a cheerful Mohamad on the roof terrace. He was also very helpful‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2014,3,Nice room,"Nice entrance way, sitting area and dining area. My party and I stayed on the 2nd floor which overlooked the courtyard. The room furnishings were pleasant. The sink pattern was the most unique that I have ever seen. The front desk was pleasant. The food was fine. Unfortunately, a few of the kitchenware were not cleaned enough for my liking or seemed old. During dinner I saw a lip print on the wine glass before taking a drink. During breakfast the silverware was either old or needed to be cleaned.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2014,5,We could not have been made more welcome,"After some searching on the web for a Riad in the Medina I came across the Dar El Kabira. The location was spot on in that it was walking distance from a number of the tourist sites and on paper it had all we were looking for so booked to stay for 4 nights over the New Year period. We arrived at the Riad 9.00pm on 30 December after our flight from the UK and we could not have been made more welcome. In asking whether it would be possible to have some dinner, menus quickly appeared and food provided.The rooms were clean and comfortable and atmospheric which fitted in perfectly with a few days in Rabat enjoying the sites. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at the Riad including offering to go to a bank for one of our group to change pounds into Dirhams as we were having‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2014,5,An Amazing Cultural Experience,"Greetings to all travelers.. As a cabin crew which travels and stayed at different places/hotels, I must say...Riad Dar El Kebira has captured my heart and I would recommend Riad Dar El Kebira -Rabat, Morocco for those travelers who wants to experience the amazing Riad's ambient. It has the value of money & culture. The staff were polite, friendly and very helpful. During the night, it was very quiet & peaceful. I fall in love with this place and looking forward to visit/ stay again in future. The interior were fantastic ( traditional concept ) with a mixed of classic French concept (bathroom). Each room has different d√©cor which I found it unique and has their own beauty . Food was tasty too.. It was walking distance to the souq and other cafe's around the corniche. Many‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2014,4,Beautiful riad,"We stumbled upon Dar El Kebira - without any booking. Even if it was late in the evening, we were warmly welcomed. We decided to cancel our booking at a nearby riad and enjoy our time at Dar El Kebira. The riad and the rooms are lovely decorated and clean. You will surely enjoy the included traditional Moroccan breakfast, served at the terrace. The staff is friendly and the service excelent.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2014,3,Understanding a Riad,"I stayed here for 4 nights attending the football from the 12th-15th December. The riad itself is comfortable and located within the medina so exploring and access to the markets is very good. With this style of accommodation do not expect generous space in your rooms. This is what you may call boutique or traditional accommodation, where fittings and facilities have been adapted over time. I personally would stay in this style again, particularly if there were two in a room as you would be falling over one another. Having booked through a travel agent (first time in a long time as it was a group booking) there is no doubt the rates charged were excessive also. The staff are very pleasant but this style is just not my cup of tea. Been there, done that, back to hotels...",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2014,5,Business travel with cultural pause,"With the soccer clubs championship taking place in December in Morocco, all hotels were overbooked by ""Real de Madrid"" or ""Cruz Azul"" staff ... finally, this was a very good thing. Between two business meetings, I spent three nights in that Riad, in the middle of the Medina. In normal time, I would have never known what is a genuine Riad and that would have been a mistake! As, I really enjoyed the beauty and atmosphere, cleanliness, all modern services of the ""Dar El Kebira"" place. On top, very good food served as if you were at home. I am not sure that big international hotels will see me again soon, in Rabat!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,4,Good place for the night,We only stayed for one night and thought the riad is in a good location but we didn't wander Rabat much. The owner lady wasn't that friendly... But she tried by making dinner reservations for us. The rooms were nice but the website made the riad nicer than it was in my opinion.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2014,4,Dar El Kebira-,"Rabat was our first stop in Morocco and selected Dar El Kebira for 2 nights for our stay but one spent one night due to being told that our booking with Booking.com arrived 10mins another booking for the same room so we were moved to another riad for the first night. When we taken back to the Dar we were up-graded to a suite which was comfortable and roomy. The location is good as it easy to get to the main section of the medina ( down Rue des Consuls) and the main sites (Kasbas des Oudayas etc which you can do in half a day). The Dar is in a quite area of the medina so there hardly any noise to be heard.The rooftop terrace gives a good view of the medina, Kasbah and port. We has dinner at the Dar on our last night and was very good and satisfying. The manager and staff were‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,4,Worth staying here,"Two of us stayed here in October. The Riad is well placed for the sights of Rabat as it's situated just inside the medina.. Bedroom was very comfortable and well equipped. Breakfast on the roof top terrace was good. We had dinner one night and were very satisfied, the following night the manager recommended another local restaurant so it's worth getting ideas from the manager as to where to go. Great advantage of Rabat over Marrakesh and Tangier is that there is no hassling in the market and the prices are much less.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,3,Reasonable Price,Best bit is Breakfast on the terrace with views of Medina.Traditional breakfast.Good for short stay.Wanted 2 rooms close together. Could not accomodate that.Next morning wanted to see manager for wifi password 'Manager is sleeping.',Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,4,"Beautiful riad, great food","The location was good, just barely inside the medina. The rooftop terrace was private with some nice views. The public areas were beautiful and really well maintained. We had one of our best dinners at this riad. The bathroom was a bit small but the room was comfortable and charming.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,3,Pleasant Riad,This was a pleasant Riad and in a convenient place in Rabat which we enjoyed. It was very quiet but the room was a little on the small side. The driver picked us up from the airport and that was the most convenient way to get to the Riad as the Medina can be confusing when you first arrive.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,3,"Very reasonable, good location, helpful staff.","Our first night ever in Morocco was in Rabat, at Dar El Kebira. After 17 hours of travel, it was very nice to have a driver from this riad pick us up from the airport (15-20min drive and then 5 min walk within the medina). This is in an easy to find and good location in the medina. The staff were very nice and helpful. Our room was a bit odd in that there was a small sitting area and bathroom on one level and then narrow steep stairs up to the bed. However, it was comfortable with an AC unit that worked well. The bathroom was disappointing - a tub with a very small curtained shower area so it was not the most comfortable or easy place to take a shower. Compared to other riads that we stayed in for similar price, this was the not quite as nice. But overall it was functional and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,4,"Attractive place, very friendly and helpful staff","This was our first trip to Morocco and Rabat was our port of entry, so we wanted something truly Moroccan. As far as we can tell, Dar El Kebira is that. The manager and her staff were very friendly, attentive, and helpful, and the place was very clean and nicdely furnished/decorated. I agree with Peter B's advice on checking room size, as our room was small. Further, we had asked for twin beds and got a room with a Queen. They did accommodate our needs by providing a roll-away bed, which worked, but took up the limited space and wasn't as comfortable as a regulaer bed. Cabs/cars can't get to the Riad because the streets are so narrow in the Medina, but it's only a 5 min. walk from the drop-off point via a well sign-posted route. It would have been nice, however, to know about‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,5,"Wonderful staff, authentic charm","This was my first visit to Morocco, and also happened to be a business trip (with 2 colleagues). I specifically requested that my local counterparts find a traditional Riad in the medina (old town), which ended up being the Riad Dar El Kebira. It was about a 20 minute drive from the airport, and an additional 5 minute walk through the maze-like alleys of the medina to the hotel (although I would have felt nervous walking through the medina alone I was always accompanied by my male companions, but that is part of the charm of the Moroccan experience, and in reality everyone we came across in the medina was friendly and polite). Once inside the hotel, I was very quickly checked in and served a wonderful mint tea before being taken to my room, which was the ""queen"" room, and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2014,4,"Helpful staff, authentic experience","Located in the Medina the Riad Dar El Kebira is well signposted amongst the narrow lane ways. We stayed in the suite, which was quite roomy, but I would check before booking as some rooms were appeared very small. Internet was very patchy, poor or non-existent in our room. The staff were obliging, especially getting our luggage from the street, and the view from the roof terrace was great. Breakfast was plentiful and our waiter had quite a sense of humour. Being in the Medina is an authentic cultural experience, so be prepared for coping with that experience. The bath/shower head was challenging to keep the water inside the bath and the floors not quite 'pearly-white' clean, but it was tidy. A bottle of wine was very expensive, but the staff were helpful in directing us wherever‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2014,3,Disappointing,"Riad Dar El Kebira was a pleasant place to stay but we were a bit disappointed. It cost about 120 euro/night (for a standard room - which is only OK). This is much more than any of the other riads we stayed in Marrakech, Essaouira, or Fez, and was not better. The Internet connection is quite bad (again compared to other riads) and the breakfast (served on the roof terrace, which was very nice) was fine but not really special. The staff were nice, but seemed to be mostly doing their job, not anticipating your needs (which we found at the other riads we visited). The final problem was that they charged us 40 MAD for a bottle of water (about 3.50 euros and cost about 6 MAD on the street), which all the other riads gave us for free - after we had a hamam (steam bath) that cost about‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2014,5,Amazing Place and Amazing Staff,"This was our first visit to Morocco and what a great first impression. Even before our trip, communication with management was great. From the time we booked our room and every time we had a question or request, we received an immediate response. The Riad is in the Medina, and about 15-minute drive from the airport. They arranged for a car to collect us from the airport and we had someone waiting on the other end to help us with our luggage. This is at a cost of 250 MAD each way which can be paid when checking out, but note it has to be paid in cash. It is a very convenient arrangement if you are arriving late on a Friday evening. Our flight was delayed for an hour and the driver was still waiting for us with a smile. When we got to the Riad, we were quickly checked in and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2014,5,A welcome surprise,"We came here, referred by others and were charmingly welcomed and well treated. Being in the medina is an experience, you can get lost, but it is also the heart of the city and worth the getting lost! (There isn't really a problem as nearly everybody speaks either French or English).There are lots of things to see and explore, and the group at the Riad are so helpful, thank you Amina. There is wifi, but it can be alittle erratic, so go downstairs, have a mint tea and appreciate the surroundings.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2014,5,Again... Beautiful.,This was my second stay at the Riad Dar El Kabira. I was thrilled that I was once again going to be staying in this magnificent riad. It is tranquil and the ambiance very much what you would expect in Morocco. Amina the manager was again very welcoming and was upgraded to a gorgeous suite on the second level. Could not believe how beautiful the room was. The bathroom was extremely large and had a huge bath which was very welcome after long days on the road and roaming the medina. Chose to eat in the riad rather than go out for dinner and enjoyed a delicious lentil soup followed by beef tagine. Beautiful Meknes Rose to accompany. The perfect morocco experience in beautiful Rabat.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2014,5,First rate,My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights prior to her starting a course in Rabat. We were looked after well by all the staff who were all friendly and helpful. The attentiveness of the management to our needs was superb and I will definitely try and visit again with my wife.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2014,5,Slice of heaven,"Mohammed and Younes were stellar hosts in this magical riad tucked away in between the Kasbah and the Old City. So near to everything, including the cool Le Dhow restaurant, and yet remote and quiet, with a small alley of beautiful doors leading to the hotel. Rooms are kaleidoscopic treasures of colors, shapes and ornaments, with frosted glass windows to let in sunshine but retain privacy. Exquisite service every step of the way, decent breakfast and dinner. Claw-foot bathtubs and I'd go back in a heartbeat if I could!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2014,4,My Stay at Dar El Kebira,"I have been coming to Dar el kebira for the last five years now both on business and pleasure and it has been nothing less than sheer pleasure. The staff, the manager (Amina), the owner Mr. Alaoui have been gracious and fabulous hosts. I really recommend this fantastic place for all to visit. This is truly a Morocco experience at its most refined and traditional best. Thierry",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2014,5,Beautiful place,I stayed here at the start of a two week trip to Rabat to study Arabic. It's a beautiful riad in a good location and my room was upgraded. Staff are friendly and helpful. I'm already looking forward to staying again at the end of my trip for two more nights.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2014,4,A lovely Riad Experience,We really enjoyed our first Riad experience here. Staff very attentive and dinner was lovely although check wine prices before committing. Location great and rooms and wifi excellent. Drinks on the roof top at sunset were really special as was breakfast up there the next morning.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2014,5,A true Morrocan experience.,"The riad is easy to locate and about ten minutes from the beach.We were amazed at the beauty of this Riad.The use of original furniture and sumptuous textiles make it a stunning place to stay. Made very romantic at night by the use of candles and Morrocan lamps. The staff were all really attentive and friendly. We really enjoyed getting to know them all, We really enjoyed breakfast served on the roof terrace each morning. I have a gluten free diet so I took my own bread. But i had scrambled eggs as an alternative to the breads and cakes on offer.The staff had a copy of dietary requirments for following a gluten free diet in Arabic and French. I tried the hotels Hamman with a massage which was a great experience. I would like to thank the staff at Riad Dar el Kebira for such a‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2014,5,the perfect Riad in the middle of the medina,great place in the middle of a busy city. the roof is such a gem where you can enjoy your breakfast or a mint tea in the afternoon. I highly recommend this hotel and the staff were more than welcoming and helpful. Mohammed helped us with our bags to the taxi they ordered for our departure to the airport. Everything was flawless!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2014,4,The real moroccan experience .,"The location is perfect. The rooms are wonderfully decorated. The breakfast on the terrace is really good. The staff is very friendly. As a negative point, they were suppose to have our dinner ready for our late arrival but as our flight was delayed they were no longer expecting us so we had to go out at 12 am to looking for some dinner.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2014,3,Disappointed,"As our first stay in a riad we were disappointed with the quality of this establishment even though we were warned the standard was not equal to ""western"" star ratings. The bathroom was ridiculously small, the linen cleanliness questionable. The wait staff for the evening meal were good and the tagine very tasty but we had to pay with cash for the meal and were not advised prior to eating. The dining room was tight with no privacy, seated within 2 feet of other diners.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 June 2014,4,"2 nights, 2 rooms, 1 good one bad",The Riad is is an excellent location and the staff are friendly and helpful. It is clean throughout and has some nice d√©cor. First night stayed in the 'Standard Room Oudayas' with a Queen bed but the 'Occupancy: 3' must be a joke and 'Size: 25 sqm'is hard to believe as this room was very small - it really was just too small to enjoy and would only really suit a single. It was clean and breakfast was OK but the room was just too cramped. The next night we were offered a move to 'Luxury Room Chellah'which was a good size and much better and was a good room to have - but the website price would be a bit too steep. Could be a good choice but could be too expensive for a good room and the Oudayas would not be worth it.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2014,4,Nice stay with wife and baby,"Beautiful restored Riad close to the entrance to the old Medina, on what seem to be quite safe streets. Even walked down the streets to the Riad in the evenings and felt quite safe. Manager and staff are extremely kind and helpful in every way.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

 May 2014,5,An amazing Riad,"What an amazing place to stay! Fantastic location, and so different from a modern hotel. Having only 10 rooms, the only time we saw other guests was mainly at breakfast - it was really peaceful. When we arrived by taxi from the airport (which was easily arranged via e-mail to the Riad the week before our visit, and then added to our final bill which meant we didn't have to have ready cash in Dhirams on arrival - a small but really helpful point!), we were then led through the Medina to find the Riad - and as soon as we walked through the entrance, it felt like a complete oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of the Medina. It was luxurious, and also a really authentic Moroccan feel - including the mint tea on arrival. The room was stunning (we had the Bouregreg on the first‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2014,5,More than Authentic,"We were slightly worried about Rabat in general, BUT the Riad, the Medina and neighbouring district was so far from the tourist traps of other towns that we were in awe. It was so genuine and authentic. No pressure from the locals but real friendship was on offer everywhere. All the Riad staff were intent on giving us their best, they wanted us to enjoy and to take home memorable reminiscenses. Its location could only be bettered by its staff and their attention to detail, no request was too small or too much trouble. Hoping to return with family members later in the year.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

 April 2014,5,the jewel of Rabat....surprisingly amazing!,"I grew up in Casablanca, but lived in new York for the past 24 years. Whenever I visited Morocco, or had friends visiting Morocco, we always over see the City of Rabat and do the usual circuit (fez, Marrakech, essaouira, ouarzazate,...) This time around, I decided to take my guests to Rabat, and stay Overnight. We ended up picking Dar El Kbira because of its location, so convenient, walking distance to Kasbah Al oudaya, in the middle of the souk. As we arrived, we were greeted by a smiling team, they showed us around, and offered us some juices, and Moroccan tea in the terrace. What a view! I never knew Rabat has a view like that.....The staff was very friendly, and willing to do anything to satisfy us.

The location is just a short cab ride from Rabat Ville train station. If you don't have luggage and feel like a nice walk, you can meander down the gorgeous Mohammed V Boulevard, into the Medina and through the souks to the Riad. Each of the rooms are decorated a bit differently and are very clean and comfortable.

Incidentally, the owner of the Hotel was visiting on my second day at the Hotel and SiMohammed did not waste any time to introduce me to him, thank you for the introduction.

The staff is service oriented of the highest degree and the breakfast on the gorgeous terrace was fabulous. stay and enjoy.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2014,4,"charming riad, excellent experience","We had a wonderful experience staying here. My review will be a bit lengthy just to give others a picture of what it is like actually staying here. It was nearly a five star experience in my opinion, though I'm sure this would vary for others depending on the type of stay you are looking for. In the first place, people should know that riads are typically smaller hotels with only a few rooms, and their appeal is to have a more authentic experience of Moroccan hospitality and charm. One of the few downsides of our stay was that there are no rooms with two beds, so while I got to sleep like a princess in a beautiful canopy bed my dad slept in a small trundle bed (not quite fit for a princess but comfortable - he had no complaints but I'm sure this wouldn't work well for‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2014,3,Not worth it,"Nicely situated but that is about it. Impressive Riad but not worth the value. Room with no windows and meal not worth it, barely edible. If you like the show this is a good place, if you want real comfort try some place else",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2014,5,GREAT PLACE,"This was our first ever stay in a Rhiad and found it great!! The rooms were very clean and the staff very helpfull. You get a very real sense of the city's folklore while walking through a market and a Morrocan neighborhood, before getting to the Rhiad's entrance. Once you cross the door you inmediately feel a very nice atmosphere. The Rhiad is beautifully decorated , in a very traditional Morrocan Style. It is a great experience Overall !!!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2014,5,beautiful place,"we stayed in 4 riads whilst in Morocco, and this was by far the best. It has been restored to an excellent standard with attention to every detail. Clean and quite comfortable. Very nice room with a glorious big bath! the breakfast was mosty good - ( we asked for an omelette and were given it), and the location is very good, right by the fort and the souks; inside the medina, of course. The staff were good, particularly the manageress, who really cares about you having a good experience whilst there (told us about good cheap restaurants too!) We would THOROUGHLY recommend this for a truly Moroccan experience.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2014,4,Recommended to stay in Rabat,"We stayed here at the end of January and cant rate it highly enough. The Rooms are amazing, spacious, decorated beautifully and very clean. The staff cant do enough for you and the breakfast lovely. We had dinner one night and it was delicious. Its a very chilled out place and the moment you walk through the front door you are transported to a haven of relaxation and luxury. The Manager recommended restaurants, places to visit, view points, all of which were excellent. Recommended.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2014,5,Bravi!!,"A wonderful place in the heart of the Medina. Very close to Rue the Consuls (ask the taxi driver to let you at the beginning of this road; you'll find a police station on your left and then follow the indications for the Dar. You'll take the first on your right). Staff is incredibly available and helpful. Place is quiet and comfortable. Breakfast is served on the beautiful terrace. Si Mohamed is very kind. Choose it,you'll never regret!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2014,4,Wonderful!!,"I wholeheartedly recommend staying here when visiting Rabat. It is in a great location - in the medina but not too far in with good signage so you can find it, and very close to some great beach views, the Kasbah les Oudayas, and the Andalusian Gardens. Our room was not huge but very comfortable and there are some very nice places you can sit and read and have wine or tea in the main courtyard which is done up beautifully. Breakfast is included - on the rooftop terrace which has an interesting view of a wide expanse of rooftops, etc. The staff is very courteous. Would definitely come back.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2013,4,Must go back one day!,"Only had two nights in Dar El Kebira. Got taxi from railway station (travelled to Rabat from Marrakesh). Driver gave us wrong directions - no cars in Medina. Young shop keeper left his shop and took us there AND he would not take a tip. Was just happy to practice his Englidh. Although in the heart of the Medina, quite a pleasant approach to the riad. Roads narrow but clean. Riad was quite breathtakingly beautiful. Room also very attractive although not much usable space e.g.. no drawers or desk/dressing table. TV but no hairdryer although I had emailed ahead and they said there were hair dryers. Had dinner on first night. Service was impeccable - all staff very well trained - almost over the top. Food good but usual Moroccan menus. Wine a bit expensive but good. ‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2013,5,Excellent Riad,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this charming Riad within the medina. The rooms were authentically decorated and spotless. And there was plenty of hot water in the shower! The staff were friendly and welcoming. The breakfast upstairs near the terrace was delicious. I highly recommend this Riad.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2013,5,Wonderful Moroccan experience!,"Earlier this month, my friends and I went for a two week tour across Morocco. We visited several cities and one of our favorite stays was at this beautiful Riad in the medina in Rabat. The entire experience was top notch. The traditional Moroccan architecture just blew us away, and the terrace view of the city was spectacular. The staff was very warm, welcoming and made us feel right at home. The manager Amina, was extremely friendly and tended to our every need with a smile! Amina was also very knowledgeable about the city and had excellent entertainment recommendations for us while we were in town. The restaurant had a wonderful ambiance and served up delicious traditional Moroccan dishes. The rooms were very clean and luxurious and the comfortable beds were the perfect end‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2013,3,Moroccan experience with terrible breakfast,"We stayed in this hotel as it had a higher favorable rating from fellow travelers as compared to other hotels in Rabat. As all Riads, this one is also one of the old buildings converted into hotels inside one of alleys in the Medina. While getting in and out is not a problem expect some filth leading to the hotel door step. The rooms are Ok for the value. One might be wowed if it is your first time in Morocco but then the decors and the colors are Moroccan specialty anyway and you will find it everywhere. Do not expect much on your breakfast. The Moroccan pancakes are drenched in fat, yogurt and the plain omelets undercooked. The only good thing on breakfast was fresh fruit juice. Overall it was OK not great for both comfort and Moroccan hospitality. Staffs are friendly and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2013,5,Just beautiful!,"We were a group of 10 friends from Italy and stayed there for 1 night on 04 October. We were very pleasantly surprised by the welcome we received, the decor and serene beauty of the place, the professionalism, courtesy and efficiency of the staff. The rooms were comfortable, lavishly decorated and very clean. We had an aperitif in the roof terrace, a superb dinner in the patio with impeccable service from the well-trained staff and then an equally good breakfast again in the roof terrace. We were generally looked after by Yessir, who speaks very fluent English and is very helpful and efficient. It is located in the Medina but at the same time near enough to the sea front. After dinner, we took a stroll in the Medina which is smaller than, for instance, the ones in Fez and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2013,5,Feel like home,"In one word, the best. Located in the heart of the city, everything is quite reachable through many transport means. I loved the architecture and the design, very unique. Besides, staff are friendly and polite which makes my stay very enjoyable. Rooms are clean, and the bed very comfy. All of this for a good price.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2013,4,Elegant traditional riad,"This one will not disappoint you! Elegant,well run, friendly staff, good food, pleasant roof top terrace for breakfast,,,,,and Rabat was a real surprise! Don't miss a visit to the ruins of Chellah....small, but very interesting.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2013,4,A beautiful traditional Riad,"Tucked away in the Medina, you are in the heart of old Rabat. We arrived at Casablanca Airport and the Riad had kindly organised for a taxi to pick us up, which we were really grateful for as it was a late flight in too late for the train. Arriving at midnight we were whisked up to our room and told not to worry about checking in until the morning. It was a beautiful room, with everything you could need. It was lovely hearing the call to prayer each morning too. The only downside of staying in such a beautiful building is that the doors clank and you wake up early to others moving about the building but it certainly didn't spoil anything. Breakfast on the roof terrace with blue skies was a great start to the day and was very tasty too. We even braved a Hammam which was lovely.‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2013,4,Good quality accommodation,"We stayed a night here and we pleased with our room. Although a bit dark, the bed was very comfortable, and the wifi worked well. We eat out that evening at Le dhow. We would have eaten in but when we asked for the menu at 14.30 we were told it was too late to order most of the items including brochettes. That left a very limited choice. Strange that they were disinterested in having a party of 5 eat in. Breakfast was fine but be aware that English is not well understood. We asked for 3 scrambled eggs and one fried egg and got 3 boiled eggs and an omelette! It would have been better for them to have said say that they didn't understand. Even in French we had problems.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2013,1,Don't come here hungry.,I wish the restaurant lived up to the beauty of the riad. We were looking forward to a relaxing Moroccan dinner in the riad after being told they had a Moroccan kitchen and served dinner starting at 7:30 pm. Imagine our surprise when we went to eat and found almost every item on the menu was not available. No couscous that day (huh? isn't that in *every* Moroccan restaurant?). We ended up with 3 oily dishes of unrecognizable vegetables and a tagine of more vegetables-- soggy and floating in oil. To say the meal was horrible is an understatement. It was only after we complained about the lack of choices that the hotelier told us we needed to have ordered our dinner before 3:00 pm. How could we have ordered at 3:00 when we arrived at 4:30? We were pretty surprised to see a‚Ä¶,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2013,4,Small. It cosy,"Our riad in Rabat was beautiful. It is in a great spot for wandering to the medina. It is very neat and clean. Unfortunately, two women travelling together seem to accumulate a lot of luggage and the room was so small we had nowhere to put our luggage. After a bit of furniture being shuffled around and a few giggles we somehow managed to get things organised. My girlfriend then collapsed on the bed and we realised that the beds were so narrow that we might end up on the floor during the night. However, it was a lovely clean room with a small bathroom to go with the small room. I highly recommend staying at this riad. The staff were helpful and friendly and it is in a great location.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2013,4,A lovely place,"A very traditional Riad with a truly authentic Moroccan feeling. Excellent, clean rooms with large baths. The massage service was also very good! The food is good, but it's pricey for what you get. I only have one minor criticism: the bread at breakfast was hard and on one morning it was even frozen in the middle. There is a shop right next door to the riad selling delicious fresh bread. Some of this in the morning would be excellent! Otherwise, thank you again for a lovely stay.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2013,5,Beautiful and very friendly,We loved this place. In a very quiet and beautiful part of the Medina yet still close to Rue de Consuls shopping and the Kasbah Oudaya. Extremely friendly staff. Good food. Beautiful rooms (very different each one so choose the right one for you). Breakfast on the rooftop. Can highly recommend this place!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 August 2013,3,Great traditional ambience,"Traditional home with moroccan decor and ambience, very charming. Inside the Medina but easy to reach and in a safe and rather clean area. Staff and owner M.me Amina very kind and helpful. Room with traditional beautiful decor all but practical. A bit humid. Not suitable for business travellers with lots of things to recharge and in need of desk space . If you care more about charm than comfort it is your place.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2013,5,Absolutely fantastic traditional Moroccan Riad,This is an amazing place to stay in Rabat. It is located in the medina. Cars can't drive on the roads near the hotel and it is traditional and romantic. This is a huge traditional Moroccan home that is very spacious and beautiful. Great value for your money. The suites are stunning. And there is a great rooftop terrace that offers good views. I would highly recommend staying here in Rabat.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

The building‚Äôs traditional d√©cor is stunningly beautiful, in the rooms as well as its soaring courtyard. We stayed at the Dar el Kebira twice, and experienced both a standard room and a suite, both were lovely and capacious. The manager and other staff are professional and most helpful ‚Äì even to the point of cheerfully transporting our luggage from the hotel to the nearest street that allows motorized traffic (which the medina itself does not allow) at 5:30 in the morning.

 June 2013,4,"Nice, but bring earplugs just in case!","We stayed at Riad dar el Kebira for 3 nights in the Oudayas room and we had a pleasant stay. The staff were nice (although most didn't really speak English so brush up on your French/Arabic!) and the riad itself feels quite homely. Breakfast is also quite generous. The room was really big, as was the bathroom. The curtains also totally blacked out the room, which was great. However, the room smelt a bit musty and felt like it hadn't been used in a while (but we don't know if this was actually the case!). The only issues we had were the fact that the room was on the ground floor and therefore it got quite noisy at times. This wasn't much of a problem for us as we'd brought earplugs, which we'd recommend in case you get this room. The shower also didn't have hot water once but it‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat

 June 2013,2,Nothing special but interior,"We stayed hotel for 3 nights but what I can say definitely it is not 5 star. I am a frequent traveller and never come across a 3 start place claiming to be 5 Star. Here are negatives 1. The place is in Narrow Street of madina and one cannot carry luggage via car or taxi. If taxi drops you at wrong end of the street (as happened to us) than, be ready to search for about quarter an hour. The location being just in Madina or among souk may not be ideal for everyone. 2. No telephone in the room. As we have to patch up with our local friends to go out together but felt great difficulty in communication. They tried to call hotel number but no one picked up. Same happened to us very next day when we tried to come back to hotel and lost our way, we called but no one picked up the‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2012,4,Family Travelers,"My family of 11 stayed at this riad in December 2012. We enjoyed our stay very much. The restoration of the facility was excellent and the sleeping rooms were just fine. The furnishings were charmingly old. We also had an excellent dinner, with good service, although we had difficulty in communicating in English with some of the staff. The staff was particularly good in dealing with the 5 youngest in our party (ages 7 to 13) who had just finished a long trip. The manager was most helpful and pleaseant. The local is excellent. We would all choose this riad for our next trip to Rabat.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2013,1,Terrible experience,"Tops the list for management with attitude, rooms with mildew, dirty showers, and high price. It only took 5 phone calls from a local person and over an hour to get the Riad to send someone for help and direction. The rest you can imagine!!!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2013,5,A great Riad in a great location -- loved it!,"My wife and stayed at Dar El Kebira in Rabat in May 2013. We LOVED it. The riad is located inside the Medina and is perfectly located for exploring the Kasbah and the souks. The restored building is beautiful, with courtyard replete with fountain, beautiful artwork, Morocco handpainted furniture, gorgeous wood doors. The room was small (European standard) but beautiful decorated. The owner and staff were wonderful, always finding ways to make your stay comfortable. Moroccan whiskey (mint tea) and sweets welcomed us upon arrival. I cannot find a single complaint. Highly recommended -- grade A in all respects. One of the two best places we stayed on our Moroccan trip, and with the location it was absolutely a delight.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2013,3,Nicely restored house with a gracious hostess,"This Dar has been carefully restored, and shows great attention to period details. Some of the interiors are a bit too Berge Follies Roaring '80s for my taste, and cleaner decor could let the bones shine. Nevertheless, this is a handsome home, a fine place to stay in Rabat, well-located near the Souk and the Fort, and a stone's throw from a beach walk. The hotel is run by a great manager who truly understands how to be hospitable, and this makes the whole experience of checking in their very worthwhile indeed.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2013,4,Feeling at home in the Medina,"This is a charming place to stay in Rabat. There was good communication before arrival, and a car service from the Casablanca airport was arranged (though I was charged 10 Euros more than originally communicated). My first time in Morocco, and the Riad soon felt like home. The room where we stayed the first night had a musty smell, but for the next two nights we were given a larger and nicer room for the original, lower room price. Great breakfast area with simple breakfast and great service, with a view over the old city. The surroundings and decor are beautiful. Location is excellent. Amina speaks very good English and is super helpful.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2013,3,Average.,"Dar el Kebira had a service that was not too bad. The problem is that most of the staffs speak only French, so we had a hard time communicating, though the staff were kind so we ended up speaking in pictures. There seemed to be mood swings in the staff though. Sometimes they completely ignored our ""hi""s. Breakfast was good, warm bread. Towels were old and unclean. The biggest problem, and the greatest thing we didn‚Äôt like about, is that our rooms were extremely small. We stayed in a deluxe room, the duplex orangers, which had an area of 24 meters squared. We have agreed to stay after we looked at the size of the room, and we understand that there were three other rooms of the same size.

Before we got to ""business"" we were greeted with Moroccan hospitality- sitting in an amazing courtyard and enjoying tea and sweets. The riad arranged for a transfer which was convenient as the driver took us as close to the riad as possible and then another person transferred us and our baggage through the streets of the Medina right to the door. A good thing- you don't want to get lost as your first experience but once you get your bearings the riad is easy to get back to. Everyone made us feel welcome and comfortable and the rooms were fine. Note that most all riads are similar in that the windows open up on the inside towards the courtyard and this means that the lower rooms can be a bit dark.

But what makes this by far the best hotel in town is the staff. They will always welcome you with a genuine smile and their warmth makes you feel actually welcome and that they are happy that you are staying at their home, they are people you wish you could be friends with.

They also didn't have the dessert we wanted and instead gave us the yoghurt used for breakfast with no reduction in the price, so felt the 280 dirhams per person completely unjustified.

The Souissi suite has windows which face the street and apparently you can hear the call to prayers at 5:30 am but I heard nothing in the Pinede suite.

I recently spent four nights there on my own and found the staff welcoming and super helpful but not suffocating. Breakfast was fresh, delicious and way more than I could eat. Beyond all the ornate touches you expect in a high-end riad, the room featured comforts like an immense tub, luxurious towels and robe. They've really got their act together here; aside from being breathtakingly beautiful the place just functions really well; I will go back, definitely.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2011,5,Beautiful stay,"arriving at Dar El Kebira we immediately felt overwelmed by the beauty and the warmth of the place. A great window through moroccan culture for my visiting friends from texas. I, myself, though from morocco, felt amazed by the authenticity of the ryad. the service was personalized and thorough.The suites were spacious and very intimate. actually, the whole place was very intimate. We enjoyed the food very much, as a connoisseur of moroccan cuisine i can tell you that the tagines and the moroccan cuisine in general, are perfectly represented. I highly recommend the place to anyone looking to enjoy a beautiful moroccan experience....",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2012,5,Fabulous luxury,"Takes your breath away! From the tales of 1001 nights! In the heart of the old town,perfect location for shopping in the souk and seeing the main sights in Rabat. Excellent service, personal attention to your every need.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2011,2,Bad experience,"Not a luxury riad but an overstuffed old place. The lobby remodeling, the food and the mint tea were good. The bedrooms are ridiculously small, no TV, no internet, no safe, no fresh air. Manager Amina ""misplaced"" one of our passports and she was very defensive and confrontational (it ""reappeared"" in a different passenger's luggage side pocket days later), making the rest of our trip in Morocco an odyssey.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2011,5,Gorgeous stop in Rabat,"We spent the first night of our Honeymoon here and this hotel did not disappoint. It is everything we would expect of a Riyad... And it was just the right size. The staff went out of their way to please. The tajines for dinner were delicious, but a little too expensive. Overall I would recommend for anyone looking for a little luxury in Rabat.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2011,5,Great!,Amazing! And so nice! Really! I can't say this enough! Thank you!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2011,4,Fantastic,"The inside is a calm, organized, friendly place. Employees will take care of u and will not disturb u in case u want to be left alone. The rooms let u sleep like a baby, fresh to go to work in the morning. Inside the medina, and if you're sick of fancy hotels but still want to be in a confortable place. This is it!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2011,4,Most convenient to the Medina !,Beautifully furnished Riad in the Medina on a street off the Rue de Consuls. Lovely interiors & bedroom. The Manager Amina was most agreeable & kind. She told us about a marvelous restaurant on the ocean called Restaurant la place that was wonderful !!!!! Right off the main street in the Mediana for the souks & shopping. We really enjoyed our stay. Thanks so much.,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2011,5,Great Friendly Location!,"What an awesome place! In the heart of the Medina, the location couldn't be better. You get a real taste of Rabat Morocco! Close to the beach, the Medina Markets, and great food! The Hotel also has great food as well. We ended up staying in 3 different rooms here! the first one was nice on the first floor but my girlfriend has allergies and the staff (which was amazing and really friendly the whole stay!) moved us up to the second floor Suite for just a little more money. The Suite was amazing and had 5 windows to get some fresh air! I would recommend staying on the second floor myself. We stayed 5 nights and the last night there was a wedding (which in morocco is quite an event and loud that lasts until 7am) and the amazing staff moved us to a quieter Room on the same‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2011,5,A perfectly situated riad with 5* hotel service,"This splendid riad is situated just off the main route through the medina and is close to the new promenade area and kasbah. The service is outstanding and the imaginatively and Arabian nights inspired rooms have all the amenities normally only found in high class hotels such as house shoes and toweling robes. Given the age and shape of the building, naturally some rooms are bigger than others, but all are well designed and have great decor and furniture. Some bathrooms only have a shower which is not a problem for most, but worth mentioning when booking if it is. There is a great roof terrace for breakfast, drinks or sunbathing and the food in the small but lovely restaurant is excellent. Overall a really great place to stay in Rabat - brilliantly situated, an authentic riad‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2011,3,A Night without fresh air!!!!!,Good location!! Hotel is like a museum and overstuffed!!! There is no direct fresh air coming to the rooms since they sealed the access to fresh air!! The rooms are smelly and claustrophic!!!,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2011,5,The most beautiful hotel and experience to date...!,"Having chosen the 'old' city in Rabat, I was looking for a true Moroccan experience. Dar El Kebira offered the charm and beauty of this culture with all modern conveniences of the Western world. Imagine this: carved wooden doors, Moroccan tiles, fireplaces, spices, jewels, lights of brass and candles reflect a sensuous, seductive peaceful environment. I had trouble leaving the hotel and I will definitely plan another vacation there. The staff was always available, discreet and no request was denied. The dining room and cuisine were wonderful. The terrace 'au soleil' for breakfast or drinks...Request the Hammam and try a hot steam and a true Moroccan spa. All stars possible. Elynn, Palm Beach, Florida",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2011,5,magical,"This is my third time visiting the wonderful country of Morocco and the first time staying at a Riad the beautiful Dar El Kebira is a wonderful place to stay it feels like you are staying in a palace the smallest details in the decoration and the comfort is meet along with the people that work there they always greeting you with a smile and want to make sure that all your expectections are meet. The food is extrardinary and I also recommend getting a hammam for the conmfort of its privacy, the breathtaking view from the terrace is amazing to catch the sunset with friends and ofcourse to have some Moroccon Tea. My staying was a truely magical experience:",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2011,5,Absolutely gorgeous,"This is an absolutely gorgeous, gracious and amazing place to stay in Rabat. This was my first trip to Morocco, traveling with friends from Texas and we were lucky enough to stay at Dar El Kebira. I had such a wonderful and magical stay here from the first moment that we were welcomed. The building is amazing and the decor takes you into another world of beauty that you usually only see in museums. The food was delicous and the staff was wonderful. DInner in the main dining area, breakfast in the rooftop terrace, spa services, everything surrounded by luxury. And to top everything off, a staff that was so helpful and gracious. I will recommend Dar El Kebira to anyone and everyone, a lodging expierience like no other.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 January 2011,5,The dar El Kariba was a perfect place to spend our first night in Morocco and set the tone for entire visit.,"Arriving from Casablanca after a long flight from Atlanta we were warmly welcomed to the beautifully decorated dar and taken to the roof terrace where surrounded by minarets the evening call to prayer echoed over the city . Supper served in front of a fire on the main level began with a delicious bowl oft harira followed by a beef tagine and ending with a luscious fresh fruit dessert of diced apples with a circle of fresh strawberries and pomegranate seeds in the middle accompanied by a bottle of Moroccan wine. The dar is interesting and comfortable, the staff warm and helpful and the food, delicious. It is located in the medina very close to the main shopping street.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2010,4,hospitality and good service for a 3 day business trip,"Thank you for making our stay so lovely. For business travelers coming from Dubai, we were really impressed to have all the benefits of a big hotel in such a charming riad in the heart of old medina.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2010,4,Etonnant- Amazing,I spent 2 lovely days in this Riad that was just terrific and affordable. I have to say that the dinner on the roof in the Middle of Rabat's Medina was just amazing. The breakfast and the room service in the room was unexpected and we trueky enjoyes our short stay..,Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2010,5,An excellent and very interesting experience,"We as a group of Bosnians being on a business trip had a very pleasant stay in this hotel. It was real pleasure to experience traditional Moroccan atmosphere and enjoy in a traditional Moroccan food. The management of the hotel, as well as the whole staff, were enormously hospitable making us to feel being at home. We recommend it to wholeheartedly to everybogy going to Rabat.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2010,3,"Business travelers, read this!","I have a bit of a dilemma here. The staff seem to be really nice folks, and I hate to say something negative about their hotel, but I do feel I need to warn other business travelers. My company has a project in Morocco and we're still looking for that perfect hotel that's decent and not too expensive (we'll need to spend many weeks there until the end of the project). So of course we checked TripAdvisor, and Dar El Kebira showed up as the city's #2 hotel *for business* (it still does as I write this). For people who don't know what a ""riad"" is (like we didn't), this can be totally misleading. Let me highlight the things that a good business hotel has and Dar El Kebira (and probably any other riad) doesn't have: - access to a main road (the hotel is in the medina - which is a‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2010,4,Good choice,"In general we discovered that Rabat is underestimated by the guide books. Beautiful, none touristy and international city! Dar el kerbina is a good base to explore the main attractions in the city and very close to the kasba and souks. Clean rooms and good service with a reasonable value for money and lots of antique furniture of different periods. Fluent English speaking owner and manager.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 November 2010,5,Ideal Riad in Ribat,"It's hard to find anything to improve at this gorgeous riad ideally located in Rabat. Rooms are beautifully decorated (no light enters in morning if you like sleeping late!), rooftop terrace is fantastic for breakfast or for lying out in the sun, service and friendliness of staff is top notch, and you are perfectly located in the medina near restaurants, the market, antique and rug stores, etc. Very relaxing and top quality place. Rabat is a good city to walk around in and it's ideal for a 48-hr city trip. Would be criminal to go to a big charmless hotel when you have options like this with infinitely more charm and style.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2010,4,"Nice, but overpriced","This was our first stop as we arrived in Morocco from an exhausting and long flight. We park our rented car at the wrong parking lot, so when we phoned the riad someone from the staff gently came to rescue us and drove us to the right place. We were surprised that they upgraded us to a suite, more spacious than the room we originally booked and with a relaxing bathtub that was really providencial for a tired couple. That was really nice from them, although the original price for the room was increased by unexpected taxes. Later on, after visting other towns and charming riads, we also noticed that the price was really expensive for what it offers. We had a dinner that was the most expensive in all our stay in Morocco. But what we will remember is their kindness in providing us‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2010,5,"A beautifully renovated and luxurious riad, highly recommended","We arrived into Rabat late at night exhausted after a delayed flight and then drive from Casablanca. Amina is the perfect host to welcome you into Morocco. Beautifully presented platters of fruit and nibbles in the rooms were just what we needed to settle, as it was too late for dinner. Chocolates on the bedside table were also a lovely touch. We are a family of five and stayed in the Orangers and Pinede suites. They were both divine, my favourite the Pinede. Both rooms were more luxurious than the website photos show. Late at night, I could not resist using the beautiful claw foot bath tub. The only riad we found in Morocco which had a bath tub. Breakfast on the terrace was delicious and plentiful and the service was excellent. We felt sorry to leave after only one night‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2010,5,Highly Recommended,"A beautifully renovated property, with a proprietor who goes out of her way to make sure you enjoy the stay .The food was excellent, although slightly on the expensive side. Highly recommended.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2010,5,"homy, cozy with VIP treatment","I definitely recommend Dar kebira. My partner and I wanted to avoid the regular, standard hotels and we found the exact spot, to our great satisfaction. The personnel is very helpful and caring. We loved the ambiance, the furniture and the lay out of our suite. You must venture to the roof-top where you will enjoy the view of the old town while drinking mint tea and tasting delicious moroccan pastries. The location of Dar kebira is of prime importance. You are right in the middle of the medina, a mere 5 mn-walk fron the rue des Consuls, the main shopping area. It was a great experience. Looking forward to renewing it.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2010,4,good not great,"This riad ranges from 3 to 4 stars in quality. The hostess speaks passable English. The structure is well designed but the furnishing are somewhat faded. We had one good meal and one poor meal. This is not as nice as other riads we stayed at during our visit. In the medina, there is far less hassle than in more touristed cities.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2010,5,"Been there several times, always had a great stay","Rabat now has quite a few good hotels but this one is a rarity in Rabat, located in an ancient, beautifully renovated riad in the medina. It has few rooms, so you won't usually be bothered by other guests. The rooms, especially the upstairs ""suites"" (slightly larger rooms) are beautiful, like the rest of the riad. The dowstairs patio (with free WiFi), the dining room, the rooftop terrace/breakfast room are all wonderful. The staff is very friendly and efficient, especially the managing lady. You probably won't be able to find the hotel on your own the first time, as it is quite well hidden in the medina, but walking there with your taxi driver or one of the hotel staff will make for a charming, wonderful first impression, along the narrow, lively streets of the old Arab city.‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2010,5,Great Personal Service,"We can't say enough about Amina and the staff at Dar El Kebira. Taking 7 friends with us to introduce them to Morocco and staying in the medina of Rabat was a great decision rather than staying in Casablanca our first night. The medina has its own mystery which created the exotic atmosphere they were hoping to see on their first trip. The staff was excellent, Amina was attentive to all our needs. She is a wonderful hotel manager. She was waiting for us as we entered the medina to transport our luggage which was an added plus. Not all riads have such a thorough service. Our room was fantastic. Some rooms need a flip of the AC (fan) to recirculate air. The hotel food was very good!!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2010,5,"next time we are in Rabat, we will eagerly stay again at the Dar el Kabira","This is an excellent Riad, featuring exquisite Andalusian/Moorish decor -- tiles, woodwork, courtyard open to the sky, intricate decorative flourishes -- plus rooftop dining, and extremely positive and helpful staff, in particular the gracious Amina. The food, too, was excellent, in one case dinner prepared for us at the last moment, since we were late arrivals and we hadn't been expected to dine at the Riad. Breakfasts were exceptional, as was every dinner. We will certainly stay at the Dar el Kabira the next time we are in Rabat. The only thing that I would do differently next time is not order a half bottle of red wine for the room after coming in late on the third night of our stay. The full bottles of white wine with dinner were fine, but the half bottle of red wasn't‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2010,5,Even better than the review,"My husband and I were in three cities, and other than this riad we stayed in standard hotels. Rabat was definitely the place to depart from that style, and this riad was every bit as nice as advertised. The pictures really do not do it justice. In addition to the place itself, the manager Amina was a reall delight, as was Mouad our server. They did everything they could to make our trip more enjoyable and relaxed, and in fact caused us to stay one more day. Direct flights go out of Casablanca, a town to avoid, but this riad offers cab service to the Casablanca airport--definitely a better choice. All in all, this was a choice that ended our trip on a high note.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2010,5,A Moroccan Jewel,"This small hotel deep inside the medina is gorgeous. We took a suite for one night and wished we could have scheduled a longer stay. The Sousissi suite was better than pictured with refined furnishings, a friendly and helpful staff, a great dinner, and a real feel that you were welcome. The rooftop lounge and inner courtyard were truly magnificent.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2010,5,The perfect riad,"For us this was the perfect place to stay in Rabat. Dar El Kebira is an intimate riad meticulously furnished and decorated throughout with carefully chosen antiques and art. The staff is friendly, helpful and always there when you need them. The restaurant is beautiful with excellent food from breakfast to dinner. Our second floor room, ""Chellah,"" was two-tiered, gorgeous and romantic. There was nothing about this riad that wasn't the best we have experienced in Morocco!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 December 2009,4,"Nice, but felt a bait and switch","The Dar was lovely and the people working there quite nice; however I was offered 2 rooms at 119E each-the Agdal and the Attarine. When I emailed to confirm shortly before our arrival, I was told that we had the Agdal for 119E and the Pineda Suite for 159E. I reminded them that we had the Attarine, but they said that was not possible. Not wishing to jeopardize our hotel on our first night in Morocco, I did not argue by email. Upon arrival, I was again told it was not possible, although I could tell that the Attarine was empty. I let it go and decided they could be the ugly Moroccan and I would not appear to be the ugly American. We came back for our last night in Rabat before leaving Morocco and this time they tried to give us and charge us for 2 suites. I asked for the‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 September 2009,5,Oasis of calm right in the middle of the medina,"I stayed there for one night on a whistle-stop tour of Rabat. Location is great - accessible on foot from the entrance to the Kasbah des Oudayas, and very close to the action in the middle of the Medina - although far enough away to be quiet enough to sleep. I didn't have any trouble with noise. The place itself looks gorgeous inside - a real oasis of calm - especially when you get up to the roof terrace for breakfast. I took dinner there in the evening - which again, I couldn't fault. Overall - a gem of a place. If you're trying to find it, there are signs up around the media; or if you have a GPS, the location is N34 01.693 W6 50.156",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2009,4,Wonderful in every way.,"We arrived around midnight, tired and weiry after a long plane and train journey but it was well worth the wait. Very friendly staff showed us around. The lovely court yard is matched but the amazing roof top terrace where you can take breakfast or meals. The room that we had was beautiful, the fixtures and furnishings were lovely particulaly the wonderful bathroom. We had a big tv and free Wi-Fi. The location is at the top end of the medena and within easy walking distance of the medena itself or the Kasbah or main town. I would highly recommend this place for either buisness or pleasure.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2009,5,A ne pas manquer,"We occupied during four nights the two small suites available. This was a unique experience, much better than most 4&5 stars hotels I use for my business. The decoration is refined; the hostess and staff are extremely dedicated. This Guest House is located in the middle of the old Medina a few minutes away from the main bazaar street. This implies accepting the lively atmosphere of a Medina with a bit of noise now and then. Finally, we had a ‚Äúsafety feeling‚Äù at all times of the days and nights we do not enjoy at home!",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2009,2,Not worth the money .,"The place was pictured to us as a luxury riad...we were disappointed. The suite ""pinede""is nothing to dream about.Clean but quite dull with a lot of noise from the street and from the courtyard inside the riad.Not much privacy in your room. Better know before that there is no safe,no mini bar ,no phone ,no tv and no internet in the suite(only a very tiny spot downstairs where you can catch your mails if you're lucky);this wouldn't be a problem if you were paying less. Breakfast is served on the small roof (truly pleasant) but food was very average. No restaurants to go dining in the surroundings : the riad meals and wine were at a very steep price according to what we ate. In summary : over-priced for what is advertised.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 February 2009,3,Nice Riad but certainly not worth the price,"The Riad is quite nice to be sure, but due to the heavy price tag I couldn't really recommend it. I stayed at Riads in Fes and Marrakech which were more luxurious and yet 20-30 euros cheaper per night. Also, while the hostess clearly made an effort to make sure we had what we want, it was never with a smile and she always seemed like she would rather be doing anything else than dealing with us. One afternoon she also seemed to be engaged in a shouting match with some of the other staff, which we could hear from our room and needless to say did not exactly make for a relaxing atmosphere. Having said that, the room was good, clean, heated and with a nice bathroom. If you're not too bothered about getting good value for money, then I'd say it's not a bad place to stay.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 October 2008,5,Charming Riad,"We were absolutely delighted with this Riad. An old building, painstakingly restored, but with a modern roof-terrace, where breakfast was served. Car-parking was about 400 metres away (close for a Riad) opposite the Kasbah, but help with the luggage can be summoned from the Riad. The manageress spoke good English, and was very friendly and helpful, and by arrangement, provided an excellent dinner one night (alcohol has to be pre-arranged). The room (on first floor) was very comfortable, with main windows overlooking the central courtyard; there were some additional windows overlooking the access alleyway, which was somewhat noisy before 11:00pm, but seemed to quieten down in the night-time.",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 July 2008,5,elegant warm riad,"An absolutely stunning riad in a terrific city. Stayed for 4 nights. The manager, Amina, was amazingly helpful, warm and open from start to finish. She met our taxi at the beginning and led us to the riad which is situated just inside the walls of Rabat's stunning medina (lovely whitewashed walls and gorgeous colours). The riad itself is breathtaking - a historic building that was always well cared for and hence, in tact. The breakfasts on the roof were very good (delicious dried spiced olives), with views of rooftops and Sale in the distance. The riad is well placed for shopping in the medina and is right across the street from the spectacular Bab des Oudaias & beautiful kasbah (make sure you have tea at Cafe Maure - the views and pastries!) and beach - which was good for our 4‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 May 2008,5,"Kind service, beautiful riad","This is a beautiful riad in Rabat, a welcome change from all the businessman hotels you'd otherwise stay at in Rabat. The riad is wonderfully decorated and the welcome -- from a fruit basket to mint tea to bottles of water -- was really nice at the end of a long trip. The staff is on top of all the details and welcome with advice and went out of their way to help return something we'd left behind by accident. The setting in the Medina is great (as people have mentioned, it's a bit tricky to find the first time but the map on their website helps and the locals in the Medina were able to guide us, too) and it's a different side of Rabat that introduced us into the beautiful, serene (at least by Fes and Marrakech standards!) Medina. The rooftop terrace was beautiful and‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 April 2008,4,Hard to find but great for someone looking to stay IN Moroccan style.,"If you book this well hidden but great guest house then make sure you don't come by car as you'll have a hard time to find it yourself. If you still do then you better get a proper map before. Once you're there, you'll love it if you want to experience a nice, small, but very special Moroccan guest house right in the very heart of the souk area and old town. Great is also that the location makes it possible to discover the most interesting parts of Rabat without a car, the only little challenge will be to find parking nearby. Just one more comment, if you are a 'one fits all' kind of a 'home away from home' seeker - don't bother to go there it's everything other than that but a true Moroccan experience for the ones who look for something truly unique which makes the‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
 March 2008,5,They really make you feel like home,"We - my wife, our 2.5yr daughter and I - stayed at Dar El Kebira for 3 nights over the weekend and just loved the place. We were a little bit verexpecting from Rabat but this hotel really made us feel so welcome and like we were staying at old friend's house. It is indeed an oasis in the place. Special thanks to hotel manager Amina - I've never seen anybody in the hotel industry going that extra mile in everything. So if the price is reasonable for you and you want to spend a night or two in Rabat - this is the place. It is very conveniently located just minutes away from main shopping street in medina (Rue Consuls) but away from it so in a quite place. We asked for a transfer from Casa - our plane arrived at 1am at night and we were met by their driver, all very professional,‚Ä¶",Dar_El_Kebira,Rabat
