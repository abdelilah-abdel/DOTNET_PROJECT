 October 2022,5,A Fabulous Stay,"We had a wonderful stay here at Riad Zahra. The staff are SO friendly and the Owners are just the loveliest: so attentive, polite and it was so nice to have been made to feel like a guest in a home rather than as a room number as hotels can make you feel. The riad is less than a 5 minute easy walk down to the beach, which was perfect! The vibe of the riad is so calming and relaxing, the rooms were kept immaculately clean and tidy and had all that we required. The garden area (with resident tortoise!) was probably our favourite, the pool was fabulous a lovely relaxing area, spacious enough to be comfortably used by multiple guests staying at the Riad. Breakfast was OUTSTANDING, the best breakfast out of the three stays we did during our Morocco trip. Walking down to…",hotelName,city
 August 2022,5,Super friendly place with great seaside vibes,We had an excellent stay at this neat riad. It was a block away from the beach and a 15-30 minute walk to the ports where the vendors are selling fresh catches. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that guests were all greeted with warm welcomes. I'm sure it's fixed by now but the shower did not drain but I was too far into vacay mode to remember to tell them about it.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2022,5,THIS CALLED HOME!!,"(+) I just feel like I slept in my own bed. Too comfy for me. The breakfast was perfect! My boyfriend and I loved it! Hotel is close to the beach area and medina like approx 10mins walking only. I didnt expect Essaouira will be this much cold. I coudln't stay in the pool more than 5mins coz the wind was too strong for me zzz. (-) Our room is no. 2, which very close to the front desk. And the view from our room is the windsurfing storage/front desk (not sure). And was so noisy. We are unable to change the room as the riad was fully booked.

 April 2022,5,Fantastic cosy Riad!,"We stayed at Zahra for five days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The Riad is lovingly furnished, with a delightful central courtyard.

Even though they were busy during our stay, they took the time to talk and were attentive and helpful. The food is also fantastic; the breakfast was great, but I'd suggest eating at least once for lunch and dinner. The seafood platter was a feast!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2022,5,A welcoming peaceful haven.,"Absolutely loved this place. We have been regular visitors to Essaouira for over 15 years and usually stay closer to the medina. This time we wanted a quiet time to relax and this was the perfect choice for us. So pleased we finally got there after several flight cancellations due to covid over the past couple of years. Xavier and his lovely wife were very friendly and welcoming. The building itself is absolutely beautiful. We had a superior room with two balconies, one overlooking the front of the hotel onto a quiet residential street and the other overlooking the side.

 February 2022,5,Beautiful Riad,"Beautiful Riad, lovely rooms, nice decoration and friendly owners. It felt like such a treat to stay here.  We liked the location being nearby the beach.

Breakfasts are great and Xavier even offered (without us asking) and made us breakfasts-to-go for our 5 a.m. departure on Day 3. Loved our pool time here. Camel rides, restaurants, and kite surfing just a 4 minute walk.

 November 2019,5,Bijou Hotel in the Windy City of Essaouira,"From the first contact by telephone, to the taxi for departure to the airport on the return trip, the overwhelming impression of Riad Zahra is one of relaxed, good natured competence. Nothing to panic about –“ if it’s not a problem, it’s not a problem, and if it is a problem then it still isn’t a problem” (I quote Xavier) ! And he means it – and it is true. Bookings (taxi, restaurant etc) are made on your behalf, and they are always correct. Languages spoken are French, Spanish, German, English, Italian and – of course – Arabic. The hotel is staffed with well trained, motivated and good natured staff. Fatima is delightful and the other bar staff and the chambermaids discreet, efficient and hard working. The pool is maintained spotlessly, getting a good clean every morning,…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2019,5,Friendly and beautiful hotel,"Extremely friendly place to stay in Essaouira. Staff is helping in everything they can and the hotel is beautiful and clean. Good location, good food, nice pool. The best place we stayed during our trip in Marocco.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2019,5,Owners are superb,"I stayed here for 2 nights on business. The owner and his staff team were all very helpful and had useful advice on literally anything and everything. I must have asked the owner a million questions during my stay and he was more than happy to answer them all with a smile. He spoke perfect english too and so do his staff. I've been Morocco 5 times in the past and never have I experienced customer service like this. He treated me like family. The riad is in a good location. The taxi takes 2minutes to town and costs 7dhs which is about 60p! The beach is less than a minute walk from the riad. The room is large, beds are comfy and pillows are nice. A nice intimate riad with a unique charm.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2019,5,"Absolutely lovely Riad, ideal for Essaouira beach and the medina","We spent a very happy 6 days staying at this lovely Riad, situated just a short walk from Essaouira beach. During that time we loved going to both of the excellent in-house restaurants (one being a ""sea-food lovers"" delight and the other having a wide choice of options, where the ""menu du jour"" is always worth a look at). We also enjoyed the buffet-style breakfasts which included freshly-squeezed orange juice, pancakes, yogurt, and fresh fruit and olives. Our children made full use of the open air pool, whilst it gave my wife and I chance to stretch out on a sun lounger or enjoy a drink on the terrace. It takes around 20 minutes to walk from the Riad into the medina, but this was very pleasant stroll along the sea front and, when we were tired, we travelled back in taxis (around…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2019,5,Fab find,We returned to this Riad for the 3rd time and will most certainly go back again. The family that own and run it and it's two fabulous restaurants are lovely and could not be more welcoming. Everything is kept spotlessly clean by the staff. Breakfast is plentiful and the pool is a delight. Xavier and Jofre deserve a special mention !,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2019,1,Fatal experience,"READ BEFORE BOOKING I spent 10 days in Morocco, moving to various riads and also coming to this. I must say that at first glance among the many who disappointed me at first sight this gave me a good impression..but it disappointed me later. the structure is beautiful and offers the possibility to park a private car without having to pay. offers a terrace where you can relax and a large swimming pool for sunbathing (given the strong wind currents). the cordiality is not lacking but it is intolerable to enter the room and find the smell of permanent bleach (and given the strong currents it is impossible to stay with the open window), at breakfast I took a glass of water and lemon from the self-service that was going to be fatal to me, there was BLEACH inside (the carafe was…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2019,1,"Everything was nice and good, except...","Look, Riad Zahra might not be a super modern or most visually stunning Riad but it has a lot going for it. It's location (30 minute walk from the Medina) is actually pretty nice and allows for a quiet night's sleep. The staff is incredibly nice, friendly, and accommodating. The food they serve is pretty good as well, and they have one of the swankiest restaurants in town. The pool area is very cute with lots of kittens (who we named Skittle and Chewy Spree) and turtles. It's a very relaxing area with many shaded spots to enjoy the weather and read a book. The breakfast is above average with several breads, pasties, some cheese and meat product, fruits and jams. Unfortunately, everything is cancelled out by the fact that we were constantly finding cockroaches in our bathroom and…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2019,5,Beautiful Riad,"Lovely friendly staff, clean traditional rooms, fabulous breakfasts and a stunning pool, this riad was wonderful. The kittens and tortoises were a bonus for the kids too! Would highly recommend. We also had lunch in the restaurant a couple of times which was delicious and well priced.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2019,5,Perfect for Family Holiday,"Riad Zahra is in a perfect location, close to the beach and a reasonable walk to the medina. Very clean and beautifully designed. I was travelling with my grandchildren aged 5 and 7, and their parents. We had a large family room overlooking the pool which we used several times a day !! The kind and helpful owners were at the hotel every day and could not do enough to make our stay perfect. The environment is very safe for children with many staff around. It was a really memorable holiday and we hope to return to Riad Zahra again next year.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2019,4,Great hotel for everyone,"We stayed here for 3 nights, the owners really made the stay special. They are very warm and welcoming and helpful. I loved the way they greeted all the children and made them feel special too. They speak excellent English great for all us non French speakers, the rest of the staff are excellent too The pool is a real asset especially to my teenage daughter and the room we had was lovely",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2019,5,"Nice hotel, good food and very high standard of services!","Herewith I would like to thank you again for a very enjoyable stay.

 June 2019,4,Lovely Riad with lovely people,"Myself, husband and two young children (aged 3 and 4) stayed in Riad Zahra for 3 nights. Its a beautiful Riad, clean, cosey and has very spacious rooms. All the staff are lovely and extremely helpful, and the children really warmed to them. I'd googled a camel riding experience and when i'd asked the staff about this i was advised that it's one of the companies they work with - they booked this for me and arranged a pick up to the ranch within 10 minutes of me inquiring, and there were no extra costs booking via the Riad. I was very impressed! The only very slight negative comments is that due to the popular seafood restaurant upstairs, it can be noisy in the evenings as you can hear the tables and chairs being moved etc, but i think that depends on where your room is situated…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2019,5,wonderful !,We were made to feel very welcome. Lovely pool too and just a few minutes walk to the beautiful beach. The hotel was clean and well furnished. We walked into the town every day ad found eveything accessible.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2019,5,"Beautiful riad, great staff","We stayed at Riad Zahra for only two nights but wish we could have stayed longer. We arrived in Essaouria after 3 days in Marrakech and the chilled vibe and lower temperatures were exactly what we needed. The riad is clean and very spacious, the room for 3 of us had plenty of space. Though it wasn't that warm when we were there, I still had a dip in the pool which was lovely. Breakfast was great and staff were super helpful about getting in and around town and also organising airport transport for us. It is about a 20 minute walk to the main Medina in Essaouria but it's a lovely walk along the seafront, or you can get a taxi for around 10/20 Dirham. Would recommend just walking as it's not far. Beautiful town - try the seafood on the harbour!!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,"Great, cosy, homely place","We stayed for 2 nights and wish we had stayed for longer! The riad is clean, welcoming staff with spacious, clean and airy rooms. Comfortable beds, high quality crisp fresh towels. Staff are very friendly and helpful which I suppose stems from ever smiling Xavier and his lovely wife who are always at hand to help with tips and answer any questions. Its situated in a superb location few minutes from the beach and about 15 minutes from the Medina. It has two restaurants that provide a good selection and quality of food is super. We ate at the seafood restaurant on first night and were impressed with the presentation, quality and taste - worth going there even if not staying at the riad. Hospitality of Xavier and his family top it all....Highly recommend this place and will…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,Great riad and great restaurant,This is a nice riad very well managed. It is very close to the beach and about 15 minutes walk along the beach to the Medina and the port. We had a large family room with view sea view. The pool is very nice too. The riad has two restaurants. We dined at the elegant seafood one with fresh fish and lobster from the tank. Make sure to reserve in advance. We recommend the restaurant even if not staying in the riad.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2019,5,Lovely accomodation with a warm reception,"This was really one of the nicest places that we stayed in, during our recent tour of Morocco. From the moment we arrived, the staff were friendly, spoke good English, and made us feel at home. The food was excellent and our lovely room had a small balcony with a side view of the ocean. If I ever visit Essaouira again, I will definitely stay at Riad Zahra. Pity we were there at the tail end of winter, so couldn't enjoy the stunning pool, but hopefully next time it will be there in summer.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,Really comfortable and warming experience,"Arrived the hotel late and was not disappointed with the attentive service! The hotel room was neat and clean with a sense of style and moderness. Meals were delicious and filling, but its a shame to had not been able to try the pool within the hotel (it looks great and safe as well!). Will definitely rebook if my friends and I were to visit this town for a second time.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2018,5,Spacious Room with a cute Balcony,"This Riad is only 5 minutes walk from the coastline; where you can enjoy people flying kites, surfing, playing ball or just enjoying the walk along the promenade. Its very windy if you, so carry a jacket. This Riad layout is very beautiful; all rooms are upstairs and the restaurant is tucked at one Conner. The rooms are spacious with a cute balcony - nice chairs are provided for you to just sit and chill. Generous amount of toiletries are provided. The room is well decorated. The breakfast spread is good and well presented. Enjoyed my breakfast here. Good place to stay as its nice and quiet.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,Wonderful hotel with beautiful pool,"Wonderful building, comfortable room and bed, clean, and great staff. Breakfast is good and the location is perfect for the beach.

 January 2019,5,Kind staff & great customer service,"My husband, 2 daughters & I stayed 1 night at Riad Zahra as part of a tour we booked through Viajes Marruecos Inolvidable tours. The staff were very friendly & dinner was delicious. Loved the decor of the room & the hotel. In the morning my husband & 1 daughter fell ill. Xavier & his wife were amazing providing me with information of a local pharmacy, providing food & drinks after breakfast was completed & allowed us to have a later check out. When we completed our tour in Marrakech, I realised I had left a scarf ( with sentimental value) at the hotel so I emailed the Riad to see if it had been located. Xavier replied very quickly & after a few really kind emails, he arranged to have a driver bring the scarf to Marrakech for my collection. Xavier & his wife hospitality was…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2019,5,Perfect Riad by the beach,"We stayed at the Riad 2 nights and loved it. From the room that accommodated us 4, to the perfect cleanness and ambiance of the room and the hotel, to the most beautiful decorations and art pieces - it was perfect in every way. What made a wonderful difference was a wonderful French/Moroccan restaurant with great food at breakfast and dinner. They also serve alcohol - featuring local beers, local wines and local fair. The French owner and the hosts could not be nicer - including giving us a lift when out driver could not get through the closed streets. The hotel is a short walking distance to the beach which is also a big plus. Highly recommended!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2019,5,Nice stay for a good price,"Nice rooms, spacious and clean, there was a cleaning team everyday. The bathroom was nice as well.

 December 2018,5,Highly recommend this Riad in Essaouira,"My husband and I are Indian professionals working in Malaysia. This was our first trip to Africa and we arrived in Essaouira on our last leg of the trip, tired and irritated by some racism along the way. We were just going to spend one night and then, we would be heading off to Casablanca for our flight. So we were cautious with the warm welcome at the desk that afternoon. We settled into a clean and airy room on the first floor, with fresh and clean towels, but minimal toiletries, which we did not mind. We travel with our own anyway. We went out for lunch and got back to the same friendly face behind the desk. We asked for a kettle and were promised that it would be given to us at dinner. We went out again to visit the beach and the Medina, and when back, the kettle was…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2018,4,Hospitality and food,"Riad with 24 rooms is very big....the owner (husband and wife) is Spain origin, very friendy and helpfull. Room is okay.

 May 2018,5,Must Stay,"This place is absolutely 5* in every way. It is family owned and ran, and done properly. The mom and dad went truly above and beyond any of my expectations in making me feel safe and comfortable during my stay. As a female traveler in her 20s I had a truly beautiful experience at this place. It is up to date, spacious, family or solo friendly, each room has its own middle eastern characteristics, its immaculate, both restaurants in the hotel are delicious and properly priced, and the pool area is well kept. I would stay here 1000 times over if i ever came back to Essaouira. Thank you for all the family and staff for making my stay perfect!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2018,5,"Great place, great staff, great pool - Thin doors!","Loved staying at this place, the staff and owners are fantastic, and the riad is well taken care of. The pool is one of the better pools I've seen in riads so far, and I've travelled all over Morocco. One thing to note however, which wasn't a great inconvenience but still something one should be aware of, is the fact that the doors are fairly thin. If you are a light sleeper, or intend to sleep in long into the day, be aware that you might hear other guests walk outside of your room, or talking in the lobby. Regardless of this fact (which is the same for most riads), I would highly recommend Riad Zahra for travellers to Essaouira.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2018,5,Charming place; can't wait to go back!,"Riad Zahra is a pleasant, charming place to stay with very interesting decor in the hallways and lobby. The host, Xavier, was engaging, friendly and very helpful to us before and during our stay. He and his staff made us feel welcome. The rooms, which were simple and pretty, were very comfortable and appealing. We wanted to stay longer. The breakfast was lovely. It was a great value and we can not imagine a better place to stay in Essaouira!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2018,5,Couldn’t Be Better,"Everything about the Riad Zahra is wonderful: the lovely hosts, friendly staff, big and beautiful rooms, pool, location close to the ocean, and the food in both on-site restaurants. We could not have been happier, especially since we were staying a week. Choose one of the junior suites for a spacious and well designed space...",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2018,5,Almost perfect!,"Perfect place for a relaxing few days with friends. 20 minute stroll along the seafront into the medina and to the port, ideal to walk off the excellent lunches available in the town! Several pleasant afternoons spent chilling by the pool with a beer or a coffee The only down side was the small bed/day bed available as the second bed in a requested 'twin' room. Thznk you for a wonderful stayy - will definitely return one day.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 September 2018,5,Riad Zahra Apartment,"My wife and I returned to one of the Riad's self catering apartments for the second time in four months, returning home last weekend. Overlooking the private swimming pool on the ground floor the apartment was ideal for the two of us...one large double bed, two separate bathrooms with showers, large kitchen and sitting area plus a large conservatory. Spotlessly clean and very well appointed with all we needed. The Riad Zahra is no more than 100 metres away and we used the facilities there all the time. Two excellent restaurants, cosy bar and veranda overlooking the pool. Staff brilliant, friendly and helpful. It was noticeable that the staff were well motivated and seemed to be really involved, a tribute to the very helpful owners Xavier and Edith. We shall return again!! …",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2018,5,5 star experience in a Riad,"Very happy to have a tour of Morocco ending in this delightful seaside town. Made even more special by this amazing Riad - from the very beginning, my friends and I felt very welcome and that nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were traditional, spacious and had all that was required (I have become accustomed to not always having a mini fridge in rooms now) and the pool was a lovely place to relax by with a book and a cool drink. Both restaurants in Riad Zahara were a pleasure to eat at and once again, the service was first class. Thank you to Xavier and his family for an unforgettable stay.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2018,5,Look no further,You want a lovely traditional Riad- Yes? You want a lovely room- Yes? You want a great location near the beaches/ bars and surfing? - Yes? You want wonderful hosts who will do anything to make your trip wonderful- Yes? You want to try some lovely local wine - Yes? You want fantastic food at great prices- Yes? Well this is the Riad for you!!!!,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2017,5,"Beautiful, affordable, great location","I was traveling solo to Essaouira and booked this riad based on price and location. The owners are simply lovely and luckily are multilingual. The rooms are comfortable. The food is great! Although it felt a bit too chilly to use the pool, I enjoyed sitting by it in the evenings with a glass of wine. This riad is right across the street from the beach and close to my favorite café. A 15 minute walk will get you to the medina! Choose this riad if you want to stay out of the hustle and bustle of the medina but be within walking distance of it. And it’s a lovey stroll along the beach to get there. I miss it!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2018,5,Lovely Hotel,"Spent a few days cooling off in Essaouira after walking in the Atlas Mountains. Hotel was very traditionally decorated despite being in the modern part of town. Good pool, large rooms, reasonable prices and good quality food.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2018,2,Noisy and rundown,"Stayed here for 3 nights in June. The hotel owners and staff are very friendly and the hotel was clean, but unfortunately, the hotel itself is really rundown and needs a bit of a facelift. Our windows didn't lock and a safe was not provided. Noises at night and during the early hours of the morning were also extremely loud which resulted in my family and I struggling to sleep well. In addition to the noises outside the hotel (neighbours dog barking, cats fighting and seagulls) the banging of the hotel kitchen rubbish bins below our room and the thin walls made it hard for our stay to be peaceful and relaxing. Lastly, the structure of the walls around the pool did not block the wind and therefore it was too cold to sit by the pool. Agreeing what has been said by others, the wifi…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2018,5,Feels like being invited by friends or family.,"If you like big, anonymous, impersonal hotels with large crowds and a humming ice machine in the hallway, stay away. This is a small, family-run hotel with an atmosphere. The atmosphere is due to the decoration where you feel the care and personal taste, but most of all, the atmosphere is due to the family who runs the hotel. A Spanish couple and their son (their son is responsible for the fish restaurant upstairs where, btw., we went three times). All three of them, each in their own way, are extremely warm and welcoming, and it's more than their Mediterranean character; they seem to genuinely enjoy being with their guests.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2018,5,Fantastic Riad,"Riad Zahra is a really great place to stay in Essaouira- really near the cool beach bars and kite surf centre yet only a short walk into the Medina. The hotel has a great sheltered pool, good food, drinks and lovely owners who will make your stay a real success!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2018,4,+Lovely place and staff -Crappy wifi.,"Riad Zahra is a beautiful and pleasant building, situated in the southern part of the town in a well-situated area. There is a pool that can be used between 9 AM and 8 PM, and two restaurants are situated inside the building. The beach is a few 100 meters away. The charming Medina is 2 km away, and if you are tired after shopping and eating, a taxi back costs only about 1€. The cleanliness is spotless. The breakfast is more than acceptable and less than excellent. The only minus is that the tables in the breakfast restaurant are quite impractical and ""user-unfriendly"" for moving to and from the sofa. On the plus side are tasty coffee served with hot milk aside and freshly pressed orange juice. All in all I did enjoy the breakfast well, and it was a good start of the day. The…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,Cosy riad away from the bustle!,"Essaouira was the last in our itinerary of our 12 day Morroccan tour. We decided to stay at Riad Zahra. Firstly it is outside the Medina, so our private taxi could drop us off at the door of the riad. Secondly it is located 2 minutes walk to the beach, so a little after we checked into the riad, we took a walk to the beach. While we walked along the beach, we realized than we had almost reached the Medina. The Medina itself is small and cute and you can walk around and do some shopping for Argan oil or have a glass of fresh juice or whatever. Argan oil is produced closer to Essaouira and we felt it would be worthwhile to buy the stuff here than elsewhere in Morocco. The taxi back to the riad supposedly costs 10 Dhs, but we decided to walk back along the beach to the riad. One of…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,"Good location, big rooms, friendly staff","We were a family of 4 who booked 2 rooms in the Easter school holidays. The hotel is lovely inside and the staff at reception were lovely and there was nothing that was too much bother. Breakfast was great, with a cold buffet selection plus a daily hot item like moroccan pancakes. Pool was good although we weren't lucky enough to get the best weather so didn't use it as much as we would have otherwise. They arranged a taxi for us from the airport. Rooms were cleaned daily. Beds were hard but that seems to be the norm in Morocco, but we still slept well. In a quiet side street, easy 20-25 min walk from the Medina or around £1 in a taxi (taxi's only take 3 people). To the left along the beach is a set of 4 beach restaurants where we enjoyed lunch most days as we could sit in…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2018,3,Mixed experience,"Good points Friendly and polite staff, close to the beach. Nice pool to relax next to. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Not so good points The breakfast was okay on some days but burnt bread and eggs that were not even boiled properly on other days. (If boiling eggs was a struggle perhaps scrambled or sunny side up would have done nicely) If we had know the quality of the same monotonous breakfast that was served each day, we would not have booked with breakfast included. Also the fruit offering was a couple of half mouldy bananas, very disappointing.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,Your address for good food and fish,"We had a lovely dinner at The riad, the view was splendid, and the service was excellent. The starters were so yummy and variant, Im not a big fan of seafood but the plates were well marinated and tasted GOOD. Not to mention the homemade tiramisu, a pudding to DIE for.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2017,5,"Convinient, friendly and good value.","Stayed here in june 2017 with my family of six. We had to book two rooms, as they don't have rooms big enough for all of us. The rooms are quite big and comfortable. Breakfast is included and is very generous and tasty (maybe a bit on the sweet side though...). There is a big swimmingpool that we found to be a bit too chilly. It may be perfect on a really hot day but even in june - the weather in Essaouira was not very hot. It was at times very windy, so hold on to your hat! Location-wise, this riad is almost spot on. It is a nice walk for about fifteen minutes along the seafront into the spectacular old town. We usually opted for a 'Petite Taxi' to get back to the hotel in the evening. It's dirt cheap, fast and fun. I do need to mention the staff at Riad Zahra. Everyone is…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2018,5,A gem of a hotel,"This hotel has classic feel not the usual plastic and marble, where it out rates all the competitors is the personal service from the owners, they are there from the tome you rise till you retire and they and the staff offer excellent service. The pool tho a little cold in early January does give a lovely setting to sunbath until the early afternoon, the evening meal offer at the hotel was such good value and excellent quality that we used it every night from day two, the options and meal suggestions were a mix of flavours and every one was better than anticipated.should I return to Morocco this area and Hotel will be on the list",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2017,5,Lovely friendly hotel in a great location,"My husband and I decided to come to Morocco for a week to escape Christmas completely, and we stayed at Riad Zahra for 5 nights. After having our first night in Marrakesh and a comfortable and very cheap coach ride (80 Dh - £6.40 for a 3hr journey) we arrived at Riad Zahra. The first thing we noticed and best thing about the Riad is the staff and owners - they are extremely friendly and helpful but in a completely sincere and non-pushy way. Special mention to the delightful waiter- who also seemed to be doubling as a reception clerk and must work incredibly long hours, but always has a smile and a friendly greeting! Our room was clean and quiet and had everything we needed but I think we'd picked the cheapest when booking and I did get 'room envy' of some of the bigger…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2017,5,Authentic hotel with good atmosphere,"My girlfriend and I stayed in the hotel for 7 nights. All staff contributed to deliver a good service and the atmosphere was very positive. The location is 3 minutes walk from the beach which is handy if you go kitesurfing. I have been in many hotels all over the world, but the Riad Zahra is definately the only hotel which I hope to visit again.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2017,4,Nice and tidy,"Big riad with many rooms made it a bit unpersonal. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. Nice pool with many sunbeds. Good breakfast. The beds were a bit hard, esp. the ""sofa beds"". Clean and tidy. Very big and beautiful reseption area.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2017,3,"Nice Riad, simple accommodation.","The Riad is well kept, rooms are comfortable , the beds are worn and internet is very spotty. There is a pool to cool off on hot days, but the area gets spotty sun over the day for sun lovers. There is an on site restaurant that serves great meals and reasonable prices, which is more like fine dinning. A short 10 minute walk to the beach and a reasonable stroll (30 min) gets you to the town centre. No air conditioning, which is ok during the windy months as you get a cool night breeze. There is free on site parking and the location feels secure.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2017,3,A mixed bag!,When you go for a bargain holiday you always hope that you will be pleasantly surprised. But it’s always a risk. We decided to have late September week in Morocco staying in Essasouira at the Riad Zahra. It cost around £60 a night B&B. It was a mixed bag! It is a family run - really family run - hotel. The couple who run it live and breathe the place. They are there at breakfast and still there when you get back from a night out at 10.30. And they are attentive and friendly. The hotel is based in an old riad - as are many hotels in Morocco. A big old mansion with a central atrium with rooms gathered around it. It had a swimming pool which was one of its main attractions - although you had to be brave to swim in it - it was quite bracing! But it was nice to sit and…,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,A lovely Riad full of charm and tradition,"The Riad Zahra was recommended to me by somebody who had previously stayed there and it did not disappoint. We had a suite on the top floor with a partial view of the sea. The room was spacious for the 3 of us and had ample storage for our clothes and belongings. The beds were comfortable and the room was extremely clean. There was maid service everyday. The owner and all of the staff were exceptional. All were very friendly and extremely helpful with any requests. The pool was quite cold but the children tolerated it, especially as it was quite hot the week we went and we did encounter the resident turtle one afternoon which was lovely. The Riad is very close to the beach, not far from the camels and horses and other beach activities. It was about a 20 minute walk down to the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Short but enjoyable stay,"A quick trip out to Essaouira as part of a bigger Marrakech-based trip. Excellent place to stay, about half an hour's walk from the busy port area, and close to the promenade. Helpful and friendly staff. Nice pool. Excellent seafood at the in-house restaurant, and a cheeky wee tapas/wine-tasting deal the next day which set us up for the return journey to Marrakech.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2017,2,Be careful about the room they give you,"Our experience at this riad probably would have been much better had we been offered a better room. Ours was directly behind the reception desk, so we could hear every conversation that transpired on the other side of the wall. The room was so dark that we had trouble seeing the clothes in our suitcases, and it had a slight odor of sewage coming from the bathroom. The shower had very low water pressure, and the temperature vacillated constantly from lukewarm to cool to scalding hot. We asked to be moved (we had booked this place several weeks in advance), but the only other room they had available was right next door, which I imagined was probably not much better. To be fair, the manager only charged for one night when we had booked for 5; don't know whether we'll ever see…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Kiting,"I stayed in the apartments they have next to the riad.. Excellent quality and service. Riad Zahra helped me with everything incl money exchange, activities, transport, kiting, car rental, cleaning and even getting rid to the apt. The restaurant was also very good",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2017,5,Best hotel in Essaouira,"Just got back from an excellent 7 nights in the Riad Zahra. Xavier and his family/staff are extremely friendly and efficient, offering advice on what to do and where to go, and even organising various trips for us. There is alway a friendly welcome whenever you enter the hotel at any time during the day. We stayed in a superior room overlooking the pool on the ground floor, it was very spacious, comfortable and beautifully decorated in a traditional mannor as was the entire Riad. Food in the main restaurant was excellent, breakfast was simple yet delicious, lunch and dinner had great variety, and all the restaurant/bar staff were very friendly. (The Zahra Grill is also amazing but I will go into more detail on their review page). We were there to windsurf, surf and…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,"Great location for kitesurfing, great food, and very friendly staff","My wife, myself, our baby daughter, and my parents stayed here for the better part of a week and it was a great experience. The hosts are very hospitable and did went above and beyond to cater for all our needs especially with regards to our baby daughter. Besides both the restaurants serve great Moroccan food and it is located a few minutes on foot from the kitesurfing spots and kitesurfing schools. We will definitely also stay here the next time we visit Essaouira.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2017,5,Home from home,"Stayed at Riad Zahra and Essaouira for 5 days whilst travelling in Morocco. Lovely gem of a Hotel with traditional and sympathetic decor throughout. It is certainly a place to chill out with friendly, helpful staff and owners. You can relax in the delice bar / restaurant or have a more formal meal in the grill on the top floor. The mini suite we stayed in was a good size and spotless. There is a decent size pool pick your spot if windy snacks and drinks available throughout the day. There is a plentiful breakfast with a reasonable choice of fruits, pastries, eggs and pancakes. If you want to know anything or wish to participate in an activity the staff will arrange. We just loved the ambience of the place easy to fall asleep in the lounge area. There is also a choice of beers…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2017,4,Happy ending,"I was part of a tour group which stayed here for three nights and our tour accommodation was meant to have been at least four star. I had previously read rave reviews about this riad and was really looking forward to a three day rest after a hectic on the go tour schedule. I was therefore very disappointed to be given a room on the ground floor which although clean was very small, dark and a bit damp. I spoke with the owner and he said that our tour company had only requested standard rooms and not the superior rooms which were only about $10 more. Sensing my displeasure he very kindly moved us to another room on the top floor. This room was much bigger and was light and airy and had sea views. The thing that I loved most about this riad was the food. It was a real treat to be…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,Fantastic holiday,Fantastic 2 week stay. Delicious breakfast attentive hosts made my husbands bday very special with a cake and a superb meal at the grill restaurant. Children loved the pool and searching for the tortoises. We will definately be back,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2017,5,Excellent service and stay!,"Exceptional service and quality in Riad Zahra! We couldn't have enjoyed our stay anymore then we did, our three night stay we didn't even venture to eat anywhere else for our dinners as the restaurant upstairs was one of the best meals we have had here in Morocco. Breakfast was also great, every morning was fresh produce which we have found hard in Morocco. The only negative thing I would mention is the shower head kept falling every time I switched off the shower, which could cause a serious injury if someone had bad luck. Thank you to the owners for being so welcoming and lovely!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2017,3,"Lovely Riad, Nice Location, but only a few Issues","I stayed here for few days and I have to say that the Riad itself is nice and clean. If you come to a town like this then you obviously should not expect a brand new building [for the person who wrote about the quality of the rooms being old and rusty]. Positives are that the location is really nice, not crowded, close to the beach, and maybe 20 minutes from medina, but the taxi is very cheap [7 dirham]. Nothing to complain in this regard. The swimming pool is maintained regularly and the staffs are helpful [to the people who complain about the staff, they should be more grateful that they speak English and try to be helpful, give advice and organise things, because we've been to other places where French was the only option]. However, maybe there should be some more focus on…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,Best place to stay with friendly owners!!,we stayed there 2 weeks ago and it was a pleasure to be in a place like this. the owners are super friendly and make you feel like at home. they are showing you around the hotel and are always here to advise you or help. The location is excellent as 1 min away from the beach and only 10 min walk from the medina. the staff is very friendly and the food is good specially the fish. the room are clean and well decorated with local furnitures. it was a very nice stay and i m sure i will come again.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2017,3,family vacation,"We had a nice stay at this riad. It's a little bit farther (about a 30 minute walk) from the medina. but easy enough to pick up a ""petite taxi"" from the main street/medina to take you back and forth (10dir each way). The riad itself is generally well kept and well-equipped with a 2 restaurants on site and swimming pool (not heated). The staff (and owner) were friendly and helpful with local recommendations of things to visit and see. there is no air conditioning so keep that in mind, but if you get a seaview room then being right off the beach you will get nice breeze. but once the window closes it does heat up the room we had several meals there - as the restaurants were recommended on TA. breakfast was very good - fruit, breads, teas, coffee, juice lunch was good -…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,Wonderful Riad next to the beach!,"I loved my two-night stay at Riad Zahra. The owner was incredibly kind and friendly, always asking me how I was doing and available for any questions. The Riad is only a 20-minute walk from the city center and it is a very safe and comfortable walk along the beach. The dinners were delicious! The Riad has two of the best restaurants in Essaouira. My room was spacious and had all the necessary amenities. I didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it was lovely to have my breakfasts by the pool. This is the perfect place for some rest and relaxation, especially after visiting Marrakech!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2017,4,Wonderful Riad at a great price with excellent service.,"I booked Riad Zahra online as we wanted to visit Essaouira during our trip to Morocco for the Gnaoua festival and wanted to sure we had a place to stay. The owner responded to all pretravel queries extremely promptly and answered all our questions. The room was lovely and traditional with a little side balcony, a double bed and two settees/beds. Plenty of hot water, towels for the room and for the pool available. The staff were welcoming and helpful on all occasions without being intrusive. One evening we dined in the downstairs restaurant and loved the food and the setting. Breakfast was brought to table, fresh bread, butter and jams and there was tea/coffee and additional fruit and yoghurts. Essaouira was exceptionally windy, even more so than usual. We were happy to walk in…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2017,5,5 stars! Perfect Riad for any occasion!,"I cannot recommend this place any more ! It had everything you needed for a lovely getaway. We had been in both busy Marrakesh and the calm Atlas Mountains so we were looking for something in between and that's exactly what we got. Extremely friendly owners and staff who made an extra effort to ensure they got to know you throughout your stay and someone was always on hand to help. We ate in both restaurants and they were both great, really yummy food! The pool area was so clean and nice, we spent most afternoons there sunbathing. The room was spacious and cleaned everyday. We had a nice view of the sea from our window and there was no need for air con due to the strong winds! Essaouri itself is great.

Very kind and friendly staff. =o)",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2017,4,A gem of a place.,"A gem of a place. Less than 3 min walk from the beach, 20 mins walking to the medina. The Riad is charming with cool art and friendly staff. I did not eat at the onsite restaurant or utilize the pool but both looked pleasing (I just spent too much time outside of the Riad to take advantage of them) I highly recommend and would definitely stay here again.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2017,5,Kite boarders home-from-home Heaven,"A superb family run business where you will find very friendly owners and members of staff always willing to help meet your needs. (In deed, the owners even eat in the dining room with the guests, albeit at their own table). The two restaurants serve delicious meals, one specialising in a variety of fish dishes prepared from fresh catches of the day. The rooms offer varying degrees of comfort, depending on your budget, but are clean functional and offer a good nights sleep although light sleepers may experience a little difficulty if they require very dark rooms as the curtains are not lined. An open air pool and ridiculously low prices for large gin and tonics complete the setting. Beyond the hotel, the old Medina is a 15 minute stroll along the promenade. It will offer you…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2017,5,"Great location, wonderful staff, amazing food","Just back from a great stay in this lovely riad. The staff were friendly, helpful and very welcoming, and the food was fabulous. Especially recommend the upstairs restaurant, where you can have fabulous seafood, watching the sun go down over the beach. About a 15 minute walk along the beach from central Essaouira, which suited us fine - we were happy to be a bit away from the hubub. But this part of Essaouira still has it's own beach restaurants, and surf places. Would definitely return to the Riad Zahra",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2017,5,Great Staff and Beautiful Hotel!,"Riad Zahra..location wise, yes a bit far from the medina but in my opinion this is a great place to get away from the chaos and all the craziness in the medina. We were winding down from our vacation in Marrakech so that is probably why I feel this way.The looks of this place is simply amazing, just beautiful. Not the regular ""western/European"" feel of a tech overpriced hotel. The beach is just minutes away and local shops to eat are around the corner. Not a bad location in itself even though that the medina is about 20 minutes away by foot! The Staff was absolutely wonderful. Caring and helpful from arrival to departure. So friendly and willing to go above and beyond..I really enjoyed and appreciated that! The room was GREAT! Very clean and warm. The decor was quite nice.…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2017,3,Decent for the price,"We had to change our reservation at the last minute so got what we were told was the last room available. The room was musty, the floors were concrete and the bathroom was dimly lit and tiny. It is also located about a 20 minute walk from the old city, and we regretted not finding accommodation closer. That said, the staff was very friendly and helpful and there is a big pool, although it was not warm enough to swim.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2017,5,A welcoming oasis,"We stayed for 10 days at the start of July - our last visit to Morocco was 39 years ago. Xavier, Edith and their team at Riad Zahra made our return most enjoyable, relaxing and memorable. This is truly an oasis of calm from the hustle and bustle of everyday life; you can do as much or as little as you like and Xavier and the team will try to make that happen for you - airport transfer brilliant, and we hired a car for a day, visited a Berber market and got to see more of the real Morocco. Everyone of the diverse international guests was welcomed with the same warmth and it did not matter if you were staying one night or ten, if you were young and sporty or not so like us, if you were single, a couple or a group. Perfectly placed for walks north and south along the 8+km beach, a…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 June 2017,4,Lovely stay,"Lovely riad just over the road from the kiting area of the beach, and a 10 minute walk or 10 Dirham (1 €/ £) taxi ride from the medina, souks and harbour. Rooms were clean and spacious. The pool was perfectly clean, and an absolute must if you want to sunbathe - much too windy on the beach. The wind in essaouira is wonderful though, totally refreshing after a few days in marrakech! Xavier and his team were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. Only ate one meal in the restaurant but it was delicious. Only very minor negatives were that the beds were a little hard for me (but that's just a personal preference) and as with most riads, sound travels very easily through the walls so if you're a light sleeper you wake up a lot. But every riad I've stayed in has been like that. We…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2017,5,The perfect Riad and location........,We stayed for a week 10 -17 June.. Everything was prefect about Riad Zahra. Xavier and his team work so hard to ensure your stay is everything you want it to be. Spotlessly clean in all areas of the hotel. Delicious food and drink which can be taken at any time. A beautiful sparking swimming pool.enjoyed by the littlest and grown ups alike. Blinking distance to the most amazing beach and a very enjoyable gentle stroll along the wide beach promenade into the amazing Medina - again with everything you need to make this a truly memorable holiday.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2017,4,Short and Sweet Stay,"Just returned from a 3 nights stay at Riad Zahra (attended niece's wedding at the weekend). Wonderful hosts who were friendly and obliging to our requests from arranging airport transfers to early access to the swimming pool. This Riad is located just behind the main beach promenade stretch and 20 minutes walk to the Medina. Good breakfast with plentiful fresh fruit, bread and cake. The Superior room and the Double room were of good size and clean also the towels were changed daily although the taps and lighting in the bathroom in the Superior room may need to be updated. We (5 people) had superb meal at the Riad's Seafood Grill restaurant on our first evening then recommended this restaurant to our relatives who ate there on the following day and stated this was the best…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 May 2017,5,Amazing Riad. Highly Recommended,"Not sure where to start here! Hotel was cleaned daily, fresh towels, and poolside also cleaned including sunbeds! Staff are extremely helpful - every one of them. Food was gorgeous with generous helpings for the price. Can charge stuff to your room and pay the balance with card/cash. Bureau de change offered but only from Euros to MAD. Would recommend anyone to stay here, also family friendly.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,Simply wonderful ...,"We spent a week at Riad Zahra from 23-30 May 2017. From arrival to departure we were looked after wonderfully by the owners and their team of staff. Nothing was too much trouble, advice was plentiful. We stayed in Room 35 - one of 2 rooms with a sea view, and it was well worth it - very large room, impeccably clean and good daily service. Especially impressed by the consideration and respect given to staff during Ramadan which commenced on 28 May, with restaurants closing for short time to enable staff to take breakfast together. Both restaurants serve great food in nice, ambient surroundings and being able to open a tab for the duration of our visit was a bonus. The pool is a great place to relax after a busy day at the Medina or beach, a nice place to meet other guests…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

The three highlights for me are the pool area, where you can relax in the shade with a good book, great service from the staff and the great food in the two hotel restaurants!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,Amazing Riad and Service,"We stayed at Riad Zahra for 3 nights and had an incredible time in Essaouira (thanks to Xavier's and his son's hospitality). As soon as you step into the Riad, you are greeted by Xavier (no matter the time of the day) asking you how your day was and how he may be able to help. The amenities are fantastic - room had a beautiful view of the ocean, food at breakfast is top notch, and the pool is great to relax after a day of sightseeing/kitesurfing.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,"Friendly, laid-back, great stay!","Our first time in Morocco and Xavier and his team were the perfect hosts and immediately made us feel like the Riad Zahra was our home from home. We loved the beautiful decor in the riad, the simple but cosy room, the inner courtyard, and the fantastic restaurants - especially the view over the sea from the upstairs restaurant where we watched the sun set over the water while we ate. It is a 15-20 minute walk along the beach to the main part of town and the medina but we liked being a little outside the hustle and bustle; part of the joy of staying here was how peaceful and laid-back it was. We ate in both the upstairs and downstairs restaurants and the food was extraordinary in both - I can't compliment the chef highly enough. We definitely plan to return!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,Super friendly charming riad,Riad Zahra is a great riad located by the beach about 20 minutes from the medina (less than 1 euro taxi ride if you are lazy). The owner is super friendly and helpful and the place very nice for more than reasonable prices. Recommended!,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,My 5th time,"As always, very good to stay in riad zahra. Very friendly owners. Very close to the beach. Delicious food to eat in front of the pool. Very spacious rooms. 15min walk from the medina. Its my 5th time in riad zahra",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,A touch of class,"Edith, her husband and staff work very hard at making you feel like you are staying with friends. You feel the warmth the moment you arrive and it does not stop. Everything is perfect: location, cleanliness, excellent cuisine, the beauty of the decorations. I will come back to Essaouira and to Riad Zahra and I will recommend it to all my friends. Thank you for a wonderful time.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,Sometimes trip advisor does not have enough stars,"We arrived lated in the evening to another hotel, which we had booked online, to find that it was closed for 3 months (booking agent error!). The owner was mortified and rang the owner of the Riad Zahra to ask for advice. We got more than advice. Xavier was full (he always is) but opened up a beautiful apartment for us, for the same price as a room. For the whole week he, his wife Edith, and their children (who run the Riad) could not have been kinder or more helpful. It turned a potential disaster holiday into one of the best stays I have had anywhere EVER. The apartments are a new venture for Riad Zahra. They are 2 minutes from the beach one minute from the hotel are beautifully equipped and are set around a lovely garden with two swimming pools, one for toddlers. Essaouria…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,Had a fantastic time!,"This place was great, the people there are so friendly and caring and includes brilliant food from 2 restaurants. It's right next to the beach with only a short walk into the madina! I would highly recommend this place.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,A family reunion for a big birthday,"We had a great family and friends time here for a week, The pool area is wonderful to sit around when it got too hot, the food is excellent, and there is a good selection of drinks, all at very reasonable prices. The staff are excellent, very helpful indeed. The rooms were fine, the shower was hot and powerful, everything was clean. The location, away from the Medina (about a 25 minute walk) but close to the beach, worked well for us. I would certainly recommend the Riad Zahra.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2017,4,"Cosy, relaxed and friendly","The interior is cosy and welcoming, relaxed and friendly. We had 2 nice days along the pool (where there are turtles!) and had excellent breakfast and dinner at the hotel. I would definitely book this next time as well. I can recommend it.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2017,4,"Great place, lovely atmosphere","Our stay in Riad Zahra was very enjoyable. The owners and staff are very friendly and helpful and the place looks great. Breakfast was relativel meagre compared to other places we visited during our trip to Morocco, but given the price, it is still great value for money!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2017,5,Fantastic Fortnight,"An hotel with a great friendly, welcoming atmosphere! This hotel was booked from me by Bleukite as part of a kite boarding package. I was very happy with every aspect of the hotel. All the staff are very friendly, and efficient. The hotel boasts 2 restaurants, both of which serve delicious food. The main restaurant downstairs has a good mix of local and 'regular' dishes. The 'specials' menu changes daily and the dishes I sampled were very good. The steak from the 'regular' menu was simply delicious. The Zahra Grill upstairs is a fish restaurant which is reviewed elsewhere, but is a *must* for anybody who likes fish! Thanks for a great stay.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2017,5,"Relaxing, Clean, Quiet, Great food, will definitely stay again!","We came here to escape Marrakech for a bit. We had 2 nights booked at Riad Zahra and shortly after arriving decided we wanted to stay 3 nights. Every single thing from check-in to check-out, front door to the room, breakfast to dinner was absolutely amazing! We had the best sleep I think a person could get in Morocco, and after the noise of Marrakech we needed it! The managers are brilliant to say the least, helpful and friendly. The location is also top notch, near the beach and several beach bars/restaurants. The garden is a paradise for anyone who is a plant lover; it has tropical palms and flowering plants out by the swimming pool area which has both sun loungers and shaded comfortable places to sit while outdoors. The decor in this place is beautiful with grand staircase…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2017,5,"Clean, Friendly, Comfortable","This lovely place is in a quiet peaceful area, about a 15 walk along the beach to the medina, and about a 4 minute walk to beach. It is full of very friendly and helpful staff. The whole place is very clean. The rooms delightfully comfortable ... comfy bed for a good sleep, and good bathroom. All very peaceful. All good. I'd happily go back.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,Sea and souk stay,"Great accommodation run by a Spanish couple with lots of experience and good advice about what to do, where and how. It's about 15-20 mins walk from the Medina but you have very close access to the beach and all the activities there. It's also worth walking around the back and through the newer part of town as an alternative route to the port and/or Medina. Lots of local walks or horse riding or camel riding. Surfing and other water sports are on the door step. Riad is more like a hotel but still maintains morrocan theme. For sun worshipers it has a nice size swimming pool with good sun in the morning. I would definitely go there again, highly recommended.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2016,4,"Quite nice riad, good service","This is a quite nice riad, located on the outer part of town in a nice and quite neighborhood. Customer service was very good and welcoming, breakfast was also quite good. We booked a double room through our guide and stayed there for two nights. Our room was not bad, it was clean, but had one drawback: bed mattress and pillows were quite stiff and need to be replaced. It was not very uncomfortable to sleep in that bed.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2017,5,Beautiful Riad and wonderful staff.,"We've just returned from our fourth trip to Morocco. This stay at Riad Zahra stands out like the jewel in the crown. The staff were warm and friendly, the rooms comfortable and extremely spacious. The shower, hot, roomy and really powerful. That's been a negative in past stays in other Moroccan hotels. We ate here most days, either lunch by the pool or dinner in the evening. Lots of choice, lovely Moroccan wines and above all the service and warmth of the people running the hotel, was second to none that I've experienced in recent stays in hotel chains. We stayed from the 31st January until the 11th of February. We were only booked in originally for seven days, but we were so comfortable and happy there, we extended our stay for a further four days.. The location near the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,Great out of season holiday break,"The Riad Zahra is located close to a long, sandy beach which ends at the the walled city of Essaouira, about 20 minutes walk away. The hotel is attractively decorated in Moroccan style with spacious rooms and communal areas including a restaurant downstairs, bar, patio and lovely pool which was just warm enough for a swim in January. During high season, there is an additional fish grill on the second floor. Jofre and the staff could not have been more helpful and even let me use the office computer each evening. This is definitely the place to stay in Essaouira.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2017,2,Real shame,"Whilst the local staff were friendly welcoming and extremely helpful this place was not what we were expecting. When we got there the room smelt damp and was very cold. It had been raining and by the time we got back to the room in the evening there was a leak and water inside the suitcase. We asked to change room explained that the clothes in the bag were wet. That took a while which wasn't a problem - we understand that these things can happen. What was a problem was the owner's son who was in charge. He was rude, acted like we were making it up. He eventually agreed to put us in another room downstairs which was damp too but at least didn't have a leak. He did nothing for us on the wet clothes not even a sorry. Another day we heard a whole lot of commotion in the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,"excellent service, location and overall experience","We spent our Christmas Eve at Riad Zahra two nights during Christmas of 2016 and we were absolutely happy to be there. The best thing about Riad Zahra is its location. It is just few meters from the beach in Essaouira and you can walk along the beach to the city medina - it takes only around 10 - 15 minutes and it is a splendid walk. It is a great spot especially if you travel around Marrocco by car - you can park right in front of the Riad and do not have to worry about the car anymore. Another awesome thing is Zahras ""feel home"" approach of its owners. The owner Xavier made us feel very welcome, he will give you great tips and recommendations regarding the city and activities. Breakfast was also very lovely in a very nice hotel restaurant. The riad is full of amazing art…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,"Wonderful, homely, relaxed, beautiful riad","Lovely riad with proper Moroccan hospitality. Everyone here is friendly and laid back and very very helpful. Visited in January so didn't use the pool but I'm sure it's great in warmer months. Lovely meals, room was perfect, and just a short walk up the promenade to the medina. Highly recommended and we will be back here for sure.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,Please find time to stay at this fabulous family run hotel,"Wow is the way to describe this place Staff ,food, wine are superb .Location v near the beach Last weekend was my 5th stay and I would not consider staying anywhere else .I am loathed to tell you how wonderful it is as there may be no room in the inn for myself and family",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,Lovely Holiday!,A lovely destination. 2 minutes from the beach and a short stroll by the sea to the medina. The food was excellent and the room was very clean and comfortable. What really made the trip was the hosts. All of the staff were very friendly and I even got a free lift to the airport as mein hosts were getting the same fight as me! Could not recommend highly enough and I hope you had fun in NZ!,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Great Christmas and New Year,Xavier and Edith are wonderful hosts being always about to talk to and attentive to guests needs. The Riad itself is beautiful and the food changes daily but is always good and tasty and the staff are efficient and friendly. A great place to make your centre when visiting the area,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2017,4,Just what was needed,"Away from the main hub of activity in Marrakesh and into a more peaceful Essaouira was aided by this Riad. It's 20 mins from the Medina and 2 mins from the beach. Has a lovely pool which was too cold when there but looks a good morning swim in warmer months. Staff all brilliantly friendly and on hand for info on things to do and with transport questions. Rooms could get quite cold,they had big blankets which helped but it's that time of year. It's not far from bus station and medina. And I think is a better bet for a peaceful time in Essaouira.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,"Stay at Riad Zahra, Essaouira","Thank you for a lovely stay! Amazingly helpful and friendly team at Riad Zahra who helped with any request and made my stay really comfortable. Room was basic but clean and view of the sea, just what I needed.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Very cozy place!,"Friendly hosts, very clean and comfortable room, nice fire place in the restaurant. The draw-back is a bad wifi. It did not work in my room at all, and was on/off in the reception area. I stayed for a week, my fav treat was mint tea and Moroccan sweets:) breakfast is ok, missing cereal. But very delicious crepes!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2016,4,Nice riad near beach,"+ location is great: 2 min walk to the beach where you can ride camels/horses (my kid loved it) and to all the beachfront restaurants with good views + The riad is beautiful and nicely decorated + Big, clean pool with little garden around: it was kinda cold and pool wasn't heated but we still enjoyed a swim in the water and just hanging out by the pool looking at the flowers and birds. + Decent breakfast: had to order eggs separately though + poolside breakfast + Ok food: they also have a thai menu and I decided to try it because I had been eating veggie tagine for 3 days by then. The noodle dish wasn't authentic thai by any way but it tasted good. + friendly owners/managers + friendly and helpful staff : we ordered food in the restaurant but my kid didn't eat his plate at the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Really enjoyed our stay,"After a hectic few days in Marrakech this was exactly what we were looking for, nice clean rooms, a quiet pool (with entertainment provided from watching tortoises) close to the beach and only 25 minutes walk from the Medina (along the sea front which is very nice) the staff were very accommodating, posted our post cards, showed us directions to shops etc over all very enjoyable, just a couple of mozzy bites which I have a particularly bad reaction to so maybe bring along some repellent/close your window",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2016,5,Wonderful place to stay,This is a lovely riad with lovely staff. The food is excellent. The rooms are small but we never spent very much time in the room except to sleep The Riad is very well positioned on the beach I highly recommend it !,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2016,5,"Great, laid back Riad near the beach and a bit away from the Medina","We spent 2 nights at Riad Zahra and had a great experience. It's just off of the beach and about a 25 minute walk from the Medina (straight down the beach) which was perfect for us. The loacation was perfect for us to enjoy the Medina but have a more relaxing, quiet place to go back to. It's family-run and the staff are all really nice and laid back. Rooms are simple but sufficient, and the mattresses are quite hard which is something another reviewer commented about. They also have a restaurant on the main level that's open all day. I really liked the food and the wine we had was great. They have some interesting Moroccan wines, which we didn't know about, and there's the option of a wine tasting with tapas. The restaurant is next to the pool, and they also serve coffee/tea so…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Second visit and we loved it,"We came to arias Zahra in easter 2015 and loved it so much we returned for the exact same holiday in October 2016. This is the first time in our lives we have returned to do the Sam holiday. Xavier and his family are so welcoming. Our children loved the hot chocolates and pancakes for breakfasts; the swimming pool with its turtles and tortoises is very popular; and we love how you're so close to the beach bars - far enough out of the medina to have some tranquility, but close enough to hit the town to shop, visit and eat out. Thanks again Road Zahra for another wonderful trip.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,3,Beautiful but lacking,"This Riad was very pretty, but not very functional. The food was very good here, I epsecially liked the Meatball Tajine. I liked the location away from the Medina, close to the beach, and close to the Carrefour! I did not think the lack of air conditioning would be an issue in late October, but I was mistaken; it was very warm at night. We opened the window to cool down, but there was no mosquito net, so we got eaten up by mosquitoes. I think the addition of air conditioning would absolutely bring the rating up. I would stay here again in the cooler months, it was a very lovely place, and the staff was very kind.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Perfect end to our Moroccan adventure!,"We arrived to this beautiful Riad weary from our adventures through the Atlas mountains and the Sahara and we're delighted with what we found. The Riad itself is absolutely beautiful and is perfectly located in a nice quiet area but with excellent access to the beach and the medina. The rooms were well appointed although our bed was a bit too hard for us (true everywhere we stayed in Morocco though!). The pool area and downstairs restaurant were lovely and the staff very helpful. The food was delicious. The transfer arranged to the airport on the last morning was efficient and very comfortable whisking all five of us to the airport in plenty of time. We all had a wonderful stay at Riad Zahra and to top it all off, it was priced very reasonably indeed. We'd return if…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,3,Friendly but flawed.,"Lovely welcoming Riad. The owners & staff couldn't have been more friendly & helpful, especially when our daughter was poorly. The Riad is gorgeous with a great (if a bit cold) pool. The setting is also great - we liked being a bit further away from the Medina & so close to the beach. Travelling with teenagers means that Wi-Fi is far more important than it should be - it was unreliable & slow, & our room had so few plug sockets that the 4 of us struggled to get everything charged in the 24hrs we were in Essaouira. Also, we may have chosen badly, but the food wasn't as nice as we had elsewhere on our trip, a bit disappointing & the main reason for only 3 stars. If theres any thoughts of future investment, we knew there was no air conditioning, & that was ok. But even at the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Sian&Ricky,"We stayed a week at Riad Zahra....what a place, the staff were more than pleasant the rooms were clean and comfortable and the food is awesome, we definitely will go back again, thank you Xavier and family ☉🐪🖒",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,4,First visit to essaouira,"We stayed in this comfortable well managed Riad for two nights. The room was clean and well furnished in traditional Moroccan style. Good breakfast is included in the price- and the owner and his spouse are very hands on, eating breakfast and dinner with hosts. We had a lovely meal - Moroccan European style and if you wish to consume alcohol this is available with a selection of wines and beers as well. The location is a twenty minute walk from the Medina so it feels quiet and relaxed. I would go back again because the owners are so friendly and welcoming.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,Simply perfect,"Thanks to Xavier and Edith for their hospitality and kindness. Everything is excellent at Riad Zahra (rooms, cleanliness, food, pool, beers!) but what makes it something exceptional are the people working on it. We travel with our 3 years old daughter and they made us feel at home. Thanks to the staff: women in charge of the cleanliness, men serving breakfast and dinner, they are really friendly. Because of my job, I'm travelling all around the world staying in many different hotels and for the first time, there is nothing bad that I can introduce in my review.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Excellent stay,"I stayed with my dad for one week in mid October. We found the owners of Zahra to be very friendly and helpful, and very interactive with all guests, taking a genuine interest in everybody's experience. The decor was gorgeous, the location fab and the food delicious. We ate most days or evenings in the downstairs dining area and once in the grill upstairs. Both were fantastic. The pool was chilly but the tortoises hilarious. The staff were all very friendly and attentive and I highly recommend this hotel. The only area I think they could improve is to offer some tomato/cucumber and a boiled egg for breakfast. The choice is plentiful but it's all sweet based which is not my preference.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,An excellent stay.,"We enjoyed a relaxing stay at the Riad, with friendly attentive staff. Advice was plentiful regarding sights and activities, including booking taxis and bicycles during out stay. We hoped to kitesurf as the beach is only a few minutes away. Unfortunately there was only one day of good wind so we hope to return another time soon!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,4,One of the best,I came to this hotel with my husband for a week the room was nice clean with nice moroccan style the staff very helpfull with a big smile all the time the location is amzing 5min walk to the beach and 8min driving to the city i recommend the place,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,So good that I'm taking a group of family/friends next year,"I stayed with my daughter for a week at the end of September and loved everything about the Riad. The room (a standard) was basic but clean and traditional. Everything we ate at the Riad was wonderful and the upstairs restaurant was incredible. The staff are friendly without being intrusive and as 2 women travelling alone we felt very safe staying here. The Medina was great fun and you can get a taxi there or back for less than £1. We had such a wonderful time that we have already booked to go back for my husbands 50th birthday, along with family and friends. Would definitely recommend staying here if you're visiting Essaouira!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Kite surfing holiday,"Xavier and family were exceptional hosts and made us feel very welcome at all times and nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were very clean and lovely decor ,and staff very friendly . We were both impressed with the restaurants as we are both into catering especially Zahra Grill!

Xavier was a great host and saw that we were comfortable...location...25 minute walk to the Medina along the beach and also taxis @ 10 MRD . The breakfast was not a buffet but they would serve a group of six on their round tables..freshly baked bread , eggs to order to pay extra, we were told that the baker delivers it every morning around 8 am, for early check out you have to inform them a day earlier.

 September 2016,5,nice small hotel in Essaouira,"Very friendly small hotel, rooms were nice, with 2 patio windows to allow breeze to waft through. Staff were very good, lunches and dinners, were excellent, but breakfasts became repetitive. Nice swimming pool, but unheated, just a little too refreshing for me. it came with resident turtle which was novel. The room we stayed in , a superior room, was large enough but lacked storage space, a small chest of drawers would have worked wonders. We had a couple of small faults on arrival, but these were sorted by the next morning.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,A great experiance,Yet again the Raid Zara has come up trumps great safe family Hotel that never fails to please Superb food great location .If you are going to Essaouira this is the only place to stay it maintains a true Moroccan style The wine tasting is recommended Many thanks to all the family and staff .Recommended Many thanks see you in November,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,Great food and incredibly friendly,"Xavier and his family were incredibly friendly - always willing to help / provide tourist advice at almost any time of day. I don't like eating in hotel restaurants but the food at Riad Zahra was excellent (try the seafood in both restaurants). Location was great for us as we were there for kite surfing, surfing, horse riding etc. which was only a couple of minutes walk away. The medina is a 20min walk or a cheap (1eur), quick (<5min), easy (one road) cab ride. Being away from the medina made it nice and peaceful as well. I would definitely stay here again.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,All good,"Its my 3rd visit to riad zahra. I will for sure come back again. Very friendly service, very nice food, clean and confortable rooms. Its very close to the beach and 10min walk to the medina. The best place to stay in essaouira",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2016,4,Cosy riad,"Stayed here in a group. The management were very understanding to our needs. The food excellent. The swimming pool a great size. Ambience, wifi and location all made our stay conforable. If you have mobility issues, then there are comfortable rooms on ground floor too. Highly recommended.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2016,3,Good service,"We stayed here too shortly (arrived at 4pm and left the morning at 9am) to enjoy the swimming pool and restaurant. We preferred to visit the city, which is really nice, and spend time there. The hotel is nicely located, you can walk to the center in 15 min just along the beach, or take a taxi ride if you want to take easy. The room is spacious and plenty of comfort. Breakfast well prepared with plenty of options, fresh or cooked as you prefer. The owner and the rest of the personnel take seriously their job, paying attention to the costumer comfort. We had our rental car delivered at the hotel, and the guy could only speak Arab or Moroccan, so they also offered to help us in translation. Thanks!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,relaxing stay,"Beautiful surroundings, with a lovely family atmosphere, riad zahra is the perfect stay for all. Provides the perfect base to explore the interesting surroundings, yet also a great environment to relax around the pool, read a book, drink tea and watch our children play safely. Food is tasty, good portions and great value for money, staff and owners are happy, helpful and make you feel very welcome with some great tips and advice about things to do and the local area. Thank-you for a lovely holiday, I would highly recommend this riad for a traditional, relaxed and welcoming holiday.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,Really nice hotel,Very nice hotel and really nice and helpful staffs. On our arrival we got warm welcome by the owner of the hotel. He showed us the paces to visit on the guide map. We had problem with internet and they upgraded our room free of charge. They serves amazing foods. Only a couple of minutes walk to the the beach of Essaouira. you can spend the entire day at the beach of just be lazy by the hotel pool. Its a great place for family stay. I loved it there and I am sure you will love to stay there as well. Contact the hotel if you need pick up and drop off to and from the airport.. Book directly over the email and you'll get discount which is saved from booking websites.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,Wonderful Riad in Essaouira,"Riad Zahra is excellent in so many ways! We stayed over a week and were so well accommodated by Xavier and his wife, and the great team of staff there. They really went above and beyond to make our stay as pleasurable as possible. Rooms on the second floor are bright & beautiful, with an amazing sea view. The pool is lovely and clean, with comfy sun-loungers and the added charm of the resident tortoises who are just adorable! The facilities are very well maintained. We loved having 2 restaurants on site, and had some of our best meals in Essaouira here. The one upstairs, Zahra's Grill, is a really exceptional fish and seafood restaurant. We had a very relaxing and peaceful time, and the Riad seems to accommodate families very well too. We were assisted in arranging and…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 August 2016,5,Riad Zahra Essaouira,"What a lovely holiday we had in Morocco. We booked directly with Xavier (Owner) and his emails were always prompt and reassuring. The taxi organised by the hotel was waiting for us when we arrived at the airport and we were very warmly greeted by the owners of the riad. Every where was very clean and every member of staff was courteous and helpful. The rooms are very traditional and this makes it more personal. We passed many of the large and expensive hotels on our way into town and were glad that we chose this riad. The breakfast was lovely and a hit with children and the half board evening meal was always and without exception lovely. We didnt try the upstairs restaurant as we had lovely meals downstairs, but we did have a peek and it looked lovely with sea views. The pool…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2016,4,Nice,We stayed at the Riad zahra during a two day stay in Essaouira. The Riad is in an excellent location a few metres from the beach. The staff are very friendly and the rooms were clean and nicely decorated. We ate at the restaurant and the food was very nice although the service was a little slow. The only negative aspect of our stay was the lack of air conditioning in the rooms. Although I can appreciate this may not always be necessary so close the sea the rooms were stuffy and the Windows had to be opened. Opening the windows resulted in a lot of mosquito bites. Our room was also situated above the bins and the smell wasn't pleasant. A dog barked all night and there was a lot of noise which disturbed our sleep.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2016,4,Nice lunch in stylish riad close to beach.,"Nice lunch just off beach front - hotel itself looks very nice but we just had lunch here. Traditional Moroccan food with generous glass of wine. I noticed they offered morrocan wine tasting too. We are at the more casual one adjacent to pool, there is a #1 trip advisor Zahara grill also there. Kite surfing holidays available too!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,Fantastic stay!,"We have just returned from our second visit to Riad Zahra. I have stayed in hotels all over the world, and never stay in the same place twice.....until now!!! The Riad is absolutely fantastic and a wonderful stay if you want to recharge your batteries in a beautiful setting. The rooms are spacious. We had one with two balconies! The Riad has two amazing restaurants, making it possible to eat there day and night!!! Make sure you visit the Grill on the top floor which has a lovely view at night of the coast. There is a lovely pool which is very welcome when the temperature is so hot. The children staying were entertained by the resident turtle and tortoises there! The one thing that really makes Riad Zahra stand out from anywhere else I have stayed is the owners, their…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2016,4,"Great place, very freindly and helpful staff","We were a group of 14, including children, teenagers and grown-ups and we all had a wonderful time at Riad Zahra in June. The pool and terrace is a great place to relax and have fun and the food is very good at both restaurants. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We can really recommend this place to everybody.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,An amazing place to stay!,"Lovely people. Wonderful venue. Location is excellent, away from medina but all walking distance. Really close to some fantastic beach bars. Excellent value for money. We stayed here 5 nights for a really good price. Lovely swimming pool and they do excellent tapas and beer between 6-7pm for 35 dirham. What an excellent stay!!!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,"Lovely, welcoming hotel in a good location","We had a great stay at Riad Zahra. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, and nothing was too much trouble. Anytime we needed info or wanted to arrange something they had no trouble helping us out. The pool was very well kept, although the Essaouira winds got a bit strong at times. The room, a standard double, was simple but nice. It was cleaned daily and had everything we needed. Riad Zahra also has two restaurants. The restaurant downstairs (Les Délices de Zahra) was is good but basic. The restaurant upstairs (Zahra’s Grill) was amazing, with one of the best meals we had in Morocco. It's a 20 minute walk to the Medina, where you'd probably spend most evenings. You can get they for no more than 10 dirham if you want to take a taxi. All pretty easy. All in all, I'd have…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,"Lovely, welcoming hotel","The owners and staff at the Riad Zahra were exceptionally welcoming about everything, and in actual fact, is nicer than the official photos portray. We were very happy to have chosen this hotel and would certainly recommend it to other travellers looking for an economic place to stay. Simple but charming.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,Fantastic Hosts,"Our month long stay in Essaouira for kiting is, sadly, coming to an end. Have had a fantastic time and the family who run Riad Zahra are the most welcoming, helpful and charming hosts anywhere! Would definitely contact Riad Zahra for accommodation for our next trip to Essaouira.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2016,4,"Good location, great staff.","The owner of this Riad Hotel, as I'd describe it, was very helpful and welcoming. He speaks English, French and Spanish so communication is easy and there is good info around the Riad. The room wasn't the biggest we stayed in during our Morocco trip but it was fine for our two night stay. Breakfast was good and included cake which always gets the thumbs up from me! The pool area isn't as big as it appears on the photos, with many areas in the shade, but it is clean, tidy and nice to have if you need to cool down. The 20 minute stroll into town is lovely. We took a taxi back to the Riad in the evenings and it only costs 10 dirham (around €1). The Zarah Grill restaurant gets great reviews but we didn't eat there as the draw of the many eating places in the Medina was too…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,"Refreshing pool, quiet nights, beautiful interior, spacious room","Refreshing pool, a bit windy, but it is so everywhere in Essaouira. quiet nights, very good to sleep. beautiful interior, with amazing collection of art. spacious room. Nice breakfast in a beautiful dining room. Tasteful wine tasting of Moroccan wines with tapas- affordable (60dh). Free parking.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Great Family Run Riad,"We had 2 nights here in June and agree with all the reviews here. A great choice and very professionally run by a family who know their business and clientele well. Xavier (owner) is also completely honest, as the first night we missed the evening meal due to a mix up with our tour company (we didn't know we were on full board). So Xavier mentioned this the next morning to make sure we didn't miss again and cheerfully, without request, he would refund the meal charge and would do this again for the second night if we preferred to eat elsewhere. A very honest approach and they could have elected to not say anything and keep the difference. Room was large (even for 4) and very clean. It's a newer place and rooms are all off a central, double story foyer making it essentially a…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Saudi man in Essaouira -Riad zahra,"It is so strange from saudia arab man to find them in small town looking for kiting beach activity and relaxing faraway from hustle, noise, nightlife. I was very concern about my accommodation, the price, hospitality, food, supportive, cleaning, same as usual from any traveler. I'm really did not imagine that (Riad) or hostel can be better the 4/5 star hotel. RIAD ZAHRA they mad that to me great welcoming, excellent team work , smiling all the time, supportively at any request from me and they im coming back to Riad Zahra again. Regards to all",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Friendly family run hotel a great find so close to the Kitesurfing action,"My first visit to Morocco but I have travelled extensively. Nothing faceless or bland here - family run friendly service where you can simply see 'it matters' to them. Xavier the owner and his family where always friendly and could not do enough to help. They were importantly never overpowering as can sometimes can be the case with a smaller venue. The balance is just right. It is a street back from the seafront within quick reach of the kitesurfing and windsurfing action we had come for. Only 15-20 mins easy seafront walk to the Medina. One of the best local kiters is actually Xavier's son Geoffrey (seriously!) - always smiling he gave the more experienced in our group help with quality surfing spots and kitesurf downwinder action. The rooms were of good size, beds comfortable…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,This is a fantastic place to stay...,"I stayed here last week with a group of friends who had organised the trip and kindly asked me if I would like to join them. As such I had not done any of the pre-planning and booking so I didn't know what to expect especially as it was my first trip to Morocco. To say we had a great time and that this is a fantastic place to stay is an understatement. It has a very traditional feel as you walk in, rustic isn't the word really but certainly in keeping with it's locale. Also as you walk in you will be met by the owner and his staff. To a person they were always very friendly and helpful. Always very accommodating. I have stayed in a lot of hotels in my time and I really think this is the best experience of hotel personnel I have had. The rooms are basic but again that's in…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Lovely staff in a lovely city,"The staff make this riad. Each of them that we dealt with were lovely. Room was fine, no air conditioning but being a windy city that wasnt a major proble. Breakfast was lovely, pool very nice and some good deals to be had in the bar.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Just returned from a Fantastic Holiday,"The hotel is about 15 minutes walk from the Medina. We had a 9 year old and a 5 year old with our group and it was perfect. The owners and staff couldn't do enough for us. There were other families there and the kids all loved the pool and the turtle. This really is a super place for a family. They are so accommodating, the beach is very close and the walk to the medina along the beach is actually a bonus. The food at the hotel is also excellent and again very accommodating to families. I cannot recommend Riad Zahra enough. We are already looking forward to our next visit.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Family holiday,"What a great find. We we're looking for a hotel for probably our last family holiday, kids getting older. We were made exceptionally welcome by the owners on arrival, and were treated by all the staff in a similar fashion until we left. To coin the phrase "" it does exactly what it says on the tin"". It's a family run hotel and offers great service, I would like to mention the standard of food; excellent and the choice of sea food again exellent.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,Absolutely perfect,My sister and I just came back from a short holiday in Essauria and stayed at this Riad. Xavier (the owner) his family and all the staff made our stay so comfortable and unforgettable. The hotel is very traditionally decorated and absolutely spotless. We booked a larger room which was very nice and comfortable with double balcony and a large bathroom. The continental breakfast lovely and plentiful. The swimming pool area is perfect for the hotel size and the beach is just a 2 minutes walk. I would recommend this riad over and over again and will definitely go back.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,one of the best !,"Such a lovely place to stay, we stayed there for 2 nights. The staff are all very nice and helpfull and had a smile on there face. the owner was great from when we arrived to when we left. The pool was great too . Thank you all for a lovely week",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,Amazing Riad,"My sister and I stayed one night and loved this place! All the staff were so friendly and helpful, meeting our every request. The room was great, and pool is awesome, especially as you can enjoy a beer or 'wine tasting' experience right next to it! It's about a 20 minute walk into the medina but lovely walk along the beach or a really cheap and quick taxi. Breakfast was huge and delicious so overall great value place to stay!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,A great stay,"This Riad is a great place to stay when visiting Essaouira. It is located close to the beach, and on a walking distance to the old town and the harbour. The Riad (Spanish style) restaurant is simply great, the place to be for a wonderful risotto with lobster in the sunset. The hotel has nice comfortable rooms, a beautiful swimming pool (with turtles) and a good bar. All this gave us a great stay.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2016,4,Very much recomended stay,"Last week I have stayed 2 nights with my friends. I stayed in Essaouira before, but however my stay in this chic and cozy hotel put a spell to my Essaouira experience. The location is great to enjoy the beach, access the medina easily and rest in a peaceful silence atmosphere. The rooms are clean, comfortable and very preciously decorated. The crew and the managers were so much appreciated as they were willing to respond every single need or requests. I will come again and again.I highly recommend this hotel.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,Little gem in the Windy City,"The perfect Riad, traditionally furnished, spotlessly clean. The staff - this Riad is run by the owners and their son - are without exception absolutely wonderful. They are always smiling, happy to see you, remember your room number and nothing seems to be too much trouble. Ideally situated just one road back from the beach means that the pool area is gains some shelter from the wind. Lots of room around the pool (with its three resident turtles) with plenty of loungers and tables for a lunch in the sun. With two restaurants serving a varied and delicious menu there isn't a lot to make you leave - although if you do it's a 20 minute walk into town, three to the beach, and a taxi back is never more than just under a pound. If you have a hire car there is even parking right…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,"Cleaner, beter food and a hospitality better than a 5 star hotel","Every place in the Riad Zhara is really cleaner than anyone espect. The host Xavier, his wife and Son are really HOST! The want the best for all their geust, you have to experience yout self! The personal are not only friendlly, they are trained and friendlly, then troy the kitchen, 2 restaurants ( upstairs a grill restaurant) , the Son of the owner brings you the best food you can imagine. Father and Son looks the same, only, of course, younger, but he understands and helps you in choosing. Xavier, want the best and only the best food for his geusts. What is the secret of of Riad Zhara?? Their hobby is their work!, not just their work.

 April 2016,5,Great Place with fantastic food and location,"I was on a windsurfing trip with friends and we usually stay in the Medina. These is a very convenient location as you can easily walk to the Medina and be on a much quite area for your stay. The rooms are comfortable, extremely clean, and the decor is charming. The owners are Catalans and really nice people always trying to make your feel at home. The food from, breakfast to evening tapas is really good. The pool on a very hot day will for sure be a must. I highly recommend these Riad for everyone. Manuel - Lisbon",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,Wonderful place to stay,We had only booked to stay in this lovely raid for one night but ended up staying three. It's a lovely place. It's very well run with lovely attentive staff. Our room was clean and the free breakfast was great. I can highly recommend ! I certainly intend to stay here when I next visit the area,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,clean and quite,"Very nice hotel located a few minutes walk from the beautif beach of Essaouira, only few minutes drive from the medina. The room was perfectly clean and quite. The hotel dispose of a nice pool that you can easily enjoying even in the more windy days since it is well protected. I really enjoyed my stay, the personnel is very kind and accomodating.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,Loved Everything About This Riad !,"I can not say enough good things about this Riad. Everything was perfect! The ambience the food ...all SO good!!!! Easy to walk to places as well. The staff were friendly, spoke some English and made our stay very pleasant.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2016,4,Nice riad,"We spent 1 night in this riad and it was very nice stay. It is close to medina (15 minutes walk), its close to beach (2 minutes walk), in a quiet residential area, with parking right in front of the hotel. Riad has a pool, which we didnt have time to use. Staff is very helpful and nice. Breakfast was tasty - traditional moroccan. We would give 5 stars to this hotel, but rooms were pretty plain with no special charm. Furniture looked old. All in all - good stay in a beautiful city of Essaouira, which is a must see in Morocco.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,Loved everything about this place!,"Spent three nights here in April and had a really enjoyable stay. It's beautifully designed, has a tasteful, spacious decor and it's very professionally run by the lovely Spanish owners. Nothing is too much trouble for them and their staff. Even though it's a small hotel (23 rooms) there are two restaurants. The food is very good (we ate there twice) and you can get a set 3 course meal for £10 and they serve decent wine for £12 a bottle which is really cheap for Morocco. The upstairs restaurant is more expensive but wow! It's a 20 minute walk into the town along the sea front but a taxi will only cost you a pound! We had a standard room which was what I would class as medium sized with a good sized bathroom. It was spotlessly clean as is the whole place. You really can't go…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,Second time but not the last for sure !,"The prefect stay due to : - friendly staffs, friendly bosses always dedicated to help you or simply have a chat - not luxurious accommodation but perfect clean, a real morrocan riad, with all comfort you deserved, very good beds, good kitchen from breakfast to diner - location near to the beach and kitesurf schools (important for us), possibility to rent or clean material. For sure, if I have to go back again to Essaouira, it will be there !!! I went to a narrow beach (Moulay) with the always smiling geffrey(sorry for the spelling), Xavier's son (the proprietary) and it was amazing !!! good waves, high jumps, oasis discovery I could not imagine better hospitality in Essaouira. You make our days, Thank you so much !!! Take care & stay the same. big kisses to your lovely wife.…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2016,5,The place to stay!,"Riad Zahra was for me at least, the perfect place to stay. Quiet and unassuming with rooms that provide all that you really need with a comfortable bed, a working shower, sufficient power points and absolutely fantastic staff. Nothing was too much trouble! The owner, his wife and his family all worked in the hotel and seeing them at breakfast or dinner meant you had a point of contact who smiled - rare to find in more expensive establishments. It even had a beautiful pool, great food and quiet zones if needed. Staying off season in March meant that evenings tended to be cool so the log fire in the bar was a real bonus and even other guests seemed friendlier! Solo traveller and family friendly - an oasis of calm: THANK YOU",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2016,5,Third time in Riad Zahra,You always feel at home in this Riad. It may not be the most luxurious Riad but for us it is perfect. The warm attitude from the owner and the staff makes you feel welcomed. This will not be the last time so we warmly recommend Riad Zahra.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2016,4,Old style in new build area.,"All staff we met were helpful, polite and happy. The young man and lady on the front of house desks especially so. The room was a lovely size, comfortable, clean and all we needed. The rooms all face into the centre lobby, which is very large and echo's well. With the hardwood floors this means you hear people walking to their rooms and unlocking them. We could also hear people in the next room quite clearly. Location for us is what we wanted after being in the heart of Marrakesh, less busy, very close to the beach and a decent leg stretch along it into the port and medina. Has a nice sized pool out back. Liked best: location and front of house staff. Liked least: the echoing lobby.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2016,5,Really nice service,"It's an old well conservated building, with swimming pool. The best of the hotel are the owners. They are spanish and they arr always taking care of the clientes. They help you all that they can. I' d comebach without hesitate.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2016,4,Beautiful riad in a beautiful seaside village,"What a beautiful village Essaouira is. And topped off with a wonderful riad. Lovely rooms, excellent hosts. Beds need updating though. Only 1 room has seaview and we could not get it. Breakfast is super by the poolside just a damper was eggs was a charge of 3.5 euros, which is a dampener when u are 18 to 1. Internet a bit of a problem as is the whole of morocco. Otherwise mwah.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2015,5,Lovely place to stay in Essaouria,"I enjoyed my stay here very much. I loved the pool, found the food quite good, the rooms were clean, and the hosts were accommodating and friendly. I also really enjoyed being out of the medina but still so close to it and so close to the beach. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2016,3,beautiful views,"Set in the quiet and cozy sseaside Essaouira, Riad Zahra was a charming hideaway that boasted beautiful balcony views and traditional Moroccan style setting. Friendly owner and helpful staff made for a lovely stay overnight. room was spacious and fairly comfortable, but found breakfast a bit disappointing. Apparently, eggs are not featured on the ,frankly, bland breakfast menu. Surprising, seeing as to how every other riad we visited in Morocco included them in the menu . Ordering an omelette at Riad Zahra would set you back 30MAD. Not particularly pocket friendly .",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2015,4,Delightful couple,"The owners went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. They made an effort to make the bed large enough for my tall husband! Sadly the pool was freezing cold (I should have checked as this can also be a problem in some Hotels in Tenerife this time of year) and you couldn't sit by it due to the builders banging next door. So we tended to go to hire sunbeds from a great seafood restaurant on the beach called Fanatic. Ate there 3 times! Rooms were clean, although a bit dark if you wanted to read. Take ear plugs in case you hear Cockral and dogs barking. There is a hairdryer you can borrow. The plug sockets are plentiful and are the small round pin type. The breakfast is the same bread, pancakes and cake every day but you can ask for a boiled egg if…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2016,4,Friendly hosts. Great restaurant. Hard beds,"This is run by a very charming expat couple (French and Spanish). The facilities were efficient and clean. Unfortunately the mattresses were hard, but this was compensated by the warm covers. The decor has character. Their restaurant is ranked 5th in Essaouira and serves many foods including western favourites. They also bring food to your room. Restaurant service is slow but the same as most places in Morocco. There's a pool out the back to relax and right next to the beach. Would stay again.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2015,5,The perfect quiet gateway in a wonderfull place,"We found the place and the owner (Xavier and Edith) extremely welcoming and attentive to the details and special needs of each host. The rooms are comfy, the in-house restaurant very good. Xavier has lots of good advices for tours and visits around Essaouira as well as contacts with other local businesses (reliable one) if one wants to plan excursions or activities. Thoroughly recommended!!!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2015,5,"Excellent Riad, such lovely owners","What a lovely place to stay. It is quiet and a short walk from the beach. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Xavier and Edith are the nicest owners. Made us feel so welcome and gave us great advice for our trip! Highly recommend a stay here. 3 days was perfect length of time. Many thanks Emily and Naomi Brighton,UK",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Amazing!,"It's been a completely lovely experience. This beautiful Riad gets you into the real Morocco culture. Jofre and his family, Zahra's managers, have organized all kinds of activities for us to enjoy the most Essaouira! They are really nice :) I strongly recommend Riad Zahra and its restaurants!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,"Good environment, rooms, ambiance.","First: we would highly recommend Riad Zahra Mogador in Essaouira. The staff were friendly, the rooms were nice, and the ambiance was pleasant. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed on the very day we arrived, so we didn't get to sample the Riad Zahra Grill which is one of the top-ranked restaurants in Essaouira. We may have been spoiled by our 6-room Riad in Marrakech, but the Riad felt a bit impersonal for us. One of the delights of our trip was experiencing the personal nature of Riads (as opposed to the impersonal hotel style service in some other countries). Zahra reminded us a bit more of a hotel than a Riad. Still, great value, good ambiance and environment, and clean/pleasant rooms. Would recommend.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2015,5,This place is great,"Very friendly staff. The proprietor makes you feel like a long lost close family friend. Lovely decor. Large, clean rooms. The food here is really, really good - we ate dinner here and it was superb. And for breakfast,they lay out a lot of fresh local fruit. I don't know why other hotels in Morocco don't do the same, as the local fruit is fantastic and it's very cheap! The hotel is at the end of the beach, which we liked because it was very quiet - although it is only a 20 minute walk to the Medina.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2015,4,Decent choice for families,"Our itinerary in Morocco allowed us one night’s stay in Essaouira where we would arrive by Road from Rabat , along the coastal Road driving thru the Coastal towns of El Jadida and Safi. Having anticipated a late arrival, we did not want an expensive choice , but something decent with a homely feel to it and yet in a good location (closer to the sea). Riad Zahra ticked all those boxes. Our drive to Essaouira from Rabat took much longer than anticipated. We finally arrived at Riad Zahra around 9:00 pm. Quick check in later , took the grand central staircase to our room on the first floor. The room had a good sized window overlooking the pool. With the sun long set, the lights provided in the room were inadequate. Our room was very poorly lit that I kept looking for another…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,Wonderful stay; outstanding staff,"We stayed here for 5 nights and could not fault the place! From the moment we arrived, Xavier and his brilliant staff went out of their way to look after us and make our stay thoroughly enjoyable. We enjoyed swimming, the breakfast, the tapas hour, the tortoises and the overall atmosphere. We also ate their on our last night and the food was wonderful. Xavier was also very efficient in all of our emails prior to our arrival, sorting us out a taxi transfer and return to Marrakech airport. We couldn't recommend this place anymore; perfect! Thank you to all of the staff at Riad Zahra!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,What a really good place to stay,"I don't know how many words you can use to write a review but either I would run out of them or it would unfortunately be time to leave this place. I write this just having had another lovely lunch with my family sat round the pool with little kids having a great time in the pool. Were do I start? ..... The beginning would be a good idea we were greeted by the owners and the cool quirky reception and our bags taken to our rooms, first impressions were good our rooms were spotlessly clean and more than adequate with a really powerful shower that helped my bad shoulder after all the surfing Breakfast was always good. Lunch we had by the pool Evening meals were scrumptious! ALL of the staff including the pool guy, the maids, the waiters, the chef and the turtles were always…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Great hotel run by amazingly nice family. Wish I would stay longer!!!,"I had a great time at Riad Zahra. Since the first minute I walked in I just loved the atmosphere, the kind hosts, the amazing hall, cosy room - everything! It is very close to the beach and I would recommend to enquire about water activities with them (kite-surfing, stand up paddleboarding, surfing, etc.) as they are passionate about those sports. we had an amazing time visiting the island on SUP and kiting together. Truly amazing experience - cannot wait to be back!!! And by the way - the food in their restaurants is AMAZING too! They get fresh fish everyday and really know how not to spoil it - soooo good it was!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2015,3,average stay in a good location,"From Riad you would expect more than this small aged hotel has to offer.Rooms are spacious but in no way correspond to the RIAD . Interior of rooms is old and not in any traditional style, instead completely style-free. WIFI is present and working. Restaurant food is tasty. Breakfast is inexistent and poor. Lobby of the hotel is the only thing about this place, that earns points. Pool is unheated and pool area is tiny. Next to the hotel there was at the time of our visit a construction work going on which disturbed our stay. Location is good as all is close. Staff is friendly and helpful.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,A little piece of Heaven.,"Wow, what a fantastic couple of days spent here. We booked for one night and stayed two. Can not find fault in any way. Friendly and helpful owners and staff. Excellent food. Great choices for breakfast. Amazing lunch and evening meals. Top-notch restaurants on-site. Two of them to choose from. Beautiful relaxing Pool with resident Turtles. Our room was on the ground floor, We were given a choice of two to look at on arrival. Both were beautiful. All en-suite facilities include. We hope to return soon.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2015,2,Disappointing!,"Rooms are spacious however dingy cavern like with poor lighting. Everything is outdated and old, towels are dingy, scratchy and tattered, soap the size of a sugar cube, mattress sags, tv's are ancient, careful with your electrical appliances even with your converters. Mold in the shower floors.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2015,4,"Nice riad , good area",We stayed for 4 nights . Lovely hotel with very helpful staff . Breakfast was lush . Pool ideal for sunbathing and swimming and we loved the turtles ! Really close to the beach and about a 15-20 minute walk to the medina .,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2015,4,Great Value for Money,"Within minutes of booking we received an honest e-mail from the owner, Xavier, warning us that building works was taking place at the rear of the property. We were concerned, but needn't have been, for although it was from time to time noisy, there was more than adequate compensation by the extremely attentive, pleasant and helpful service from Xavier, his wife and all his team members. Riad Zahra's decor is best described as Shabby Chique, but this merely adds to the quirkiness of the Riad. Our room was spotlessly cleaned each day. If we required, all the towels were also changed each day. Our shower never ran out of hot water even in the early evening. In addition, towels were also provided for use by the pool where the two terrapins and three tortoises were a constant source…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Delightful home from home,"From the warm welcome that greeted us, our entire stay in this family owned Riad was delightful. Staff at all levels are efficient yet unobtrusive, helpful and charming. The Moroccan style decor from the communal areas to bedrooms is seriously attractive especially some of the paintings. Service superb. Food in both restautants excellent. The garden and large swimming pool are beautifully tended : brilliant place to relax in sun or shade and/or enjoy tapas or fuller meals - and chat to the turtles ! Owners very helpful, organising car hire, taxis etc and helping you find interestng things to do and places to visit in this glorious country. We've been before & we'll go again !",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 September 2015,5,perfect stay for Essauoira,"We stayed a little more than a week in this cosy Riad. It is family run business and you experience it from start to finish. Lovely pool with turtle attraction, good food with reasonable prices, just the right size for a small hotel. Let's hope that the constructions for a new building nearby do not have too much influence on the value of this place",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,"Nice place, great staff","Friendly and welcoming staff was exceptionally helpful. Prior to booking, the owner, Xavier, patiently responded to a serious of emails with answers to my question. He also arranged for car service from the Marrakech airport. The breakfast was excellent as was the food in both restaurants.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Excellent value accommodation,Stayed for 5 nights in Essaouira. Nicely located near the dune area were there are nice beach bars. Owners really friendly and helpful and very welcoming. Room lovely and large and pool area is great with a nice large pool. Breakfast a little basic but overall brilliant value for quality of accommodation.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Wonderful stay! Great hotel and lovely people,"I don't think we could have asked for a better place to stay for our time in Essaouira. Riad Zahra is such a lovely hotel and my boyfriend and I really felt at home there for our 10 night stay. Firstly the staff are really attentive and helpful. We felt welcome from the off, there was always a friendly greeting when we came down to breakfast in the morning or came in after a day out. They helped us to organise a kite-surfing lesson and a camel ride, and gave us breakfast to take with us to the airport on the day we left as we were leaving so early - it felt like nothing was too much trouble. Our one bump in the road was that we didn't have new toilet rolls put in our room one day but as soon as I asked at reception the problem was resolved so no complaints! We had a room…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Excellent Riad - temporarily blighted but still excellent,"This is a lovely Riad - the decor is fantastic, the quality of food is excellent and it has a lovely pool. The owners and staff were brilliant - really helpful and friendly. We had a ground floor room right beside reception which at first we worried would be noisy, but apart from the first night (when we retired early and were very tired) we didn't really notice much noise. The room was large (double bed and bed settees which could have slept up to 3 children). It was very dark - even with all the lights on and the curtains open you couldn't see properly, The bed was comfortable. It had an ensuite, with a powerful shower (although the fixture was broken so it wouldn't hold the shower head at a good angle) and loads of hot water. There was occasionally the smell of smoke…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2015,3,"big rooms, clean, nice experience","It is more a hotel than a riad, but is nice. We needed a double room for 2 people, we got a room for 4. Beds were enough big for 4 people, probably a big family, room big enough as well. Bathroom clean, no window. The hotel has a pool,which is a really good point. Unfortunatelly in front of it is a new building which is taking the son at certain point of the day. The furniture is a bit old. It has a library, so you have no need to bring books :) Breakfast is good; has many fruits, gem, honney, coffee, fresh orange juice. It is enough. It is the same breakfast everywhere :) wi fi is is good, but is each time a different one, pool, restaurant no1, restaurant no 2, terrsase, hotel. Sometime youhave to move from one to another. The price is good, so do not hesitate to book it!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Lovely people,"It was a pleasure to have stayed at The Riad Zahra, although it was for only one night. The welcome from Xavier and his wife Edith was warm. All the staff I had any interaction with was very pleasant and helpful. The room I was allocated was adequate for my needs. The swimming pool was also pleasant, and it was nice to see the small family of turtles going about their business without having to worry about guests. The location is perfect as it is only a few minutes to the beach, and a nice stroll to the harbour. The breakfast was ample, and the dinner I had was also nice. I will definitely return and stay for longer in future.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Home away from Home,"Perhaps the best riad in Essaouira. The family run home away from home is fantastically decorated, with spacious rooms in rich warming colours and very authentic. the food is so delicious you will be looking forward to the ever changing lunch/dinner menu range, or you might find a great dish from the set menus. Ether way, they are exquisite. Xavi and Edith are welcoming, honest, attentive, kind, ever so friendly and great with children. They are happy to accommodate any need and answer any question you might have. From room queries to excursion suggestions.Their entire staff are wonderful. The pool and its turtles are a great bonus!!! I have no negatives for this riad, nether did my family. Don't hesitate to book or enquire, you won't regret it",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Amazing time & place,"We travelled in a large group of 16 - rooms are spacious and clean, beds are warm and just perfect. Food is delicious, staff are kind and patient and it is well located! My friends and I had an amazing time!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Great accommodation and food,"Accommodation booked by Majestic Morocco Tours - what a great choice by Linda and Karim, who recommended and organised everything. Just a short sunshine break, so tended to stay chilling out by the pool in the day, rather than go on any other trips. The breakfast was great and the food in the riad was so good that we ate there some lunchtimes and evenings as well. Had a really good time.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,5* for Riad Zahra,"My parents, my brothers and I have just come back from an amazing stay at Riad Zahra. We arrived at the hotel and were promptly checked in and shown to our rooms. All the staff were extremely helpful and always brightened up the atmosphere of the Riad. The swimming pool was lovely amd secluded- the turtles were an added bonus! The location was excellent too, just 2 minutes walk from the beach and 20 minutes from the Medina. Mostly we walked to the Medina, but it was only 8-10 DH each way for a taxi! All the rooms were kept immaculate by the helpful cleaning staff.The good thing about being in a small hotel is that if you need anything, your queries can easily be answered and solved. However, on top of this, the person who really made our stay an excellent one was Xavier.…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,Fantastic hotel,Really lovely stay here. The hosts and room were lovely. Complimentary breakfast in the morning was delicious. The poolside area is really nice and you can spot some tortoises by the side! Good value for the rooms and stay.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!,"We have just returned from a wonderful stay at Riad Zahra. Everything was faultless - fantastic food, enjoyed at both their restaurants, a beautiful setting with every home comfort you could ask for. Yes, there is building work going on in front of the pool area, but Xavier explained that to us immediately on booking, and it was only a minor inconvenience for the guests. The rooms are very well appointed, and kept beautifully clean by the wonderful housekeeping staff. All the staff at Riad Zahra were amazing. They could not do enough to make our stay perfect in every way, and always with a huge smile on their faces!!!! I have stayed in hotels all over the world, and I would be hard pushed to recommend anywhere where I felt so much at home as at Riad Zahra.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Fantastic stay in the Riad Zahra for our 10-day windsurfing holiday to Essaouira!,"This Riad is run by a brilliant couple (from Barcelona and Midi-Pyrenees) who really, really care about the well-being of their guests. They go that extra-mile to get to know you and make sure you have no issues with the room, food etc. Some of the services provided: - Free wifi in the main atrium/lobby - very strong and very useful for checking important emails and business whilst away. - Currency exchange - they will happily exchange a range of currencies and charge NO commission. This is extremely handy, meaning you do not need to go to a local bureau de change. - Taxis - they have good contacts with the local taxi company and private hire vehicles, making a visit to the town centre or transfer to the Mogador airport very very easy. - Half Board - If you choose to pay for…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,Rasmus Henriksen,"We stayed at this charming riad for 3 nights and enjoyed the stay very much.

The breakfast is great and there's a big clean pool behind the building.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,"Delightful ""Hometel""","We stayed here for 10 nights, in a family room for myself, my husband and our 9 year old son. Our son called it a ""Hometel"" because it felt like being at home. The ambiance and decore was colourful, traditionally Moroccan yet calming. The room (no 20) was spacious and light with a double bed and two singles, one of which we used as a settee. The breakfast was simple, delicious and very fresh. Usually fresh fruit and juice, yogurt, pancakes, cake, fresh bread with jam and local honey. Our hosts, Xavier, Edith and their son Joffrey were very accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. They helped us organise a camel safari and recommended places to visit. The hotel has two restaurants: Les Delices de Zahra (bistro type international cuisine) and Zahra's Grill (seafood…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Second Visit,"This was our second visit to Riad Zahra. We stayed there two years ago on our honeymoon. This time we came with our one year old daughter. Our memories were of a pleasant hotel where we could relax and stroll into town if needed. We remembered that the service was good. We remembered wrongly. The service is excellent. On arrival we were shown around and warmly welcomed. The staff took care of our every need, however strange. Our daughter was well catered for and we didn't have to worry at all. There have been some changes. The Wifi is better; the seafront outside the hotel is not a work in progress any more and very pleasant and the restaurant downstairs has an even wider range of food on offer. We didn't eat at Zahra's Grill this time because of the baby. The biggest change…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Excellent Riad,"We stayed here for 6 days and had such a wonderful time. The owners and staff were absolutely fantastic - so friendly and willing to help with everything. The Riad is beautiful; the room very comfortable and cool; the pool clean and relaxing; and the restaurant is incredible. Breakfast was a simple but tasty selection of breads, cake and crepes with lovely coffee. The restaurant (Zahra's Grill) is simply fantastic - probably the best place we ate in Essaouira! The only slight downside was our room was on the ground floor and therefore at times a little noisy, but this didn't really bother us.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,fantastic place!,"We had a wonderful stay at Riad Zahra 2 weeks ago. The staff were without exception outstanding; nothing was too much trouble, they spoke several languages and always smiled! I have seldom seen such good service. They even made a marvellous birthday cake for my husband which they didn't charge for! The food was outstanding and the whole building was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. It was lovely to sit by the pool with their delicious food- the tortoises were a great addition too !! It is clear that the Riad is expertly managed by the charming and efficient family who own it. Many thanks for a lovely holiday.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Wonderful and stunning.,"Such a lovely place to stay, we stayed there with family 5 adults 1 child and one baby.

The pool was great my daughter krystal loved it but spike are 11 month old was not soon keen. Thank you all for a lovely week 😀",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,A fantastic place!!!! Would go back in an instant!,We were advised of this hotel by Windseekers... And what a great recommendation!!! They are just the friendliest people that can't do enough to help you!!! And you can honestly see they love their jobs!!! Hotel was stunning / service blinding / food excellent and so affordable. Sadly the wind was a bit sketchy for kite surfers wanting to learn tricks - sooooo gusty but even so Id go back in a blink of an eye !!,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,4,4 days in the sun.,"This is a lovely place to stay! From even before we arrived the owners were helping us with arranging a taxi from the airport, he was very honest about the building work around the Riad but to be honest we hardly noticed it. We were warmly greeted as we arrived, the room was comfortable and clean. The pool area was clean with plenty of chairs tables and loungers for enjoying the sun. Turtles and tortoises added to our pleasure by the pool. The breakfast is a set menu, but pleasant and more than enough to start the day. Prompt service in the excellent restaurants, bar snacks and tapas available - all excellent. It was a 15 - 20 minute walk into town which was lovely. It is very windy in the summer months so lying on the beach may not be possible, however if you like water sports…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Relaxing stay!,We had a lovely four night stay at this beautiful riad. The room was large and had everything you needed. It was decorated in a traditional way. It was so nice to have a pool to relax by and swim in- we loved the tortoises around the pool too. Food was lovely here in both restUrants especially the grill restaurant. Service was wonderful- the staff were so friendly and helpful. They helped us to arrange reservations at restaurants and booked taxis' for us- nothing seemed to much trouble. Wonderful hotel that would suit couples and families.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,A little Gem,"Riad Zhara is advertised locally as a ""23 bedroom family house"" and that's exactly what it is. As soon as you arrive you are made to feel part of the family home, everyone is so warm and friendly, helpful and polite. You will be tempted and want to go and try the different restaurants, and you should. You will discover that no where does food better than here. The chefs use best ingredients and traditional cooking which will tantalise your tastebuds. My recommendation is to try the lamb/beef rack of ribs and chicken skewers or any of the tajines. The food is amazing in this place, you'd pay a bomb to eat like that back In the UK. The Riad is furnished beautifully with traditional touches and xavier goes all out to make sure your stay is wonderful. If you want a true,…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 May 2015,5,"Beautiful, relaxing, charming","We loved staying here on the first leg of our honeymoon.

 June 2015,5,"Personal service, perfect location, gorgeous building, great food...","Riad Zahra is a near perfect vacation spot. I spent my two days two nights eating great food in their restaurants, walking to the medina along the beach, and relaxing by the pool. It's really nice to stay someplace where the staff greet you personally every time they see you and make sure that you're as happy as possible. I booked close to last minute and they were extremely accommodating, offering me the choice of one room on the lower level or switching between two upper-level rooms. I'd recommend the upper level rooms--the sea breeze is incomparable and the light is better. Rooms were all spacious with large beds and at least a small desk and chair. It was nice that they had large closets to keep bags and such out of the way. The two restaurants are quite…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2015,4,Wonderful personal Service at Riad Zahra,"As soon as we walked in to this charming riad we were greeted like old friends. Xavier and his staff cannot do any more to welcome you further. The big plus in this place is the friendliness of the staff, the simple but delicious breakfasts which are served to you and the free resting pool. The jewel in the crown is the top floor restaurant, Zahra's grill. Outstanding quality lobster rice risotto /caldeteera. Yum! Rooms... Well a little shabby chic if one were being generous. Towels etc have seen better days and housekeeping is somewhat hit a day miss. The riad is 5 minutes walk if thT from. A excellent bea have bar which has has some great live music.

Room was huge and very clean. The staff were excellent and helpful and always pleasant. Breakfast was plentiful and the turtles and tortoises by the pool were a great addition! Now you can fly direct to essaouira from Luton will seriously look at this as an ideal holiday destination over the med!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2015,3,Nice place but nothing special,"It's a pretty hotel with nice rooms and a good restaurant on the ground floor with friendly staff and good (if relatively expensive) food. It's a good location out of the town centre, just a 20 minute walk down the beach. There's a tapas restaurant at the top of the building too, but unfortunately it was closed when we were there and is closed much of the year. There was also a great deal of construction work going on next door while we were there, which is obviously not the hotel's fault. It is worth noting though that this new build will probably block sea views for anyone with rooms on the sea-facing side of the hotel. Also, pet turtles in the pool!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2015,5,"Personable, warm, family-run hotel","Coming from Marakesh, we felt kind of harassed and exhausted, so were glad to have 4 nights in this charming refuge.

Thanks for a relaxing stay!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2015,5,Great little hotel and great value,"This is a lovely family run riad. Excellent value, friendly and very helpful. It is a 25 minute walk to the medina but a lovely one and also convenient for the camels if you fancy a go! As other people have commented we appreciated Xavier's honesty about the building work and were glad we went ahead with the booking. A lovely and peaceful place to relax. My daughter loved the turtles in the well maintained and sparkling pool.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2015,5,Fantastic stay and very helpful staff,"Amazing stay in Riad Zahra with 3 other girl friends . Location is very good, nice 15-20 minute walk along the beach to the medina. We normally walk to the medina then take a taxi back (10 dirhams). It is really the staff and the service that makes us want to come back to this riad. Everyone in the riad is really helpful and friendly. Xavier very kindly helped us arrange a taxi to Imlil for us. One night we came back late and the restaurant is closing but they very kindly let us have a table and served us dinner even though it's past their normal opening hours. We had a nice afternoon chilling by the pool with the turtles. Very near the kite surfing and camel/ horse riding area. Thanks again team Riad Zahra! :)",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2015,5,Fantastic,"we had a great time at Zahra, Xavier and the team were brilliant. Food was 1st rate as was the service from all the staff.

 May 2015,5,"Family run, fabulous","Second visit, just as good as last year. It's a family run place with two good restaurants in house. Rooms are good and staff very friendly.

The staff were very helpful and friendly and so kind! Breakfast was typical french/Moroccan ... And more than substantial. We loved the location... A pleasant 20 minute walk along the beach-side esplanade into the main medina of town. The pool was huge, clean and well maintained. We loved the resident turtles! Xavier was very honest with us when we made the booking about the building works being carried out next door. I was very appreciative of his honesty and am very happy that we proceeded with the booking. The building works didn't bother us at all!

 April 2015,5,Amazing - stay here,"The family who run this riad are so lovely, helpful, nothing was to much trouble, they gave us advise/ recommendations, drew us maps. We wish we had time to stay longer. Our room was gorgeous and well decorated with comfortable beds. It is a 1 minute walk around the building onto the beach and far enough from the medina to enjoy a 20 minute stroll on the sand which means its peaceful at night. The restaurants served lovely food and it was all very reasonably priced. We would definitely stay again.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2015,4,"Beautiful, friendly riad with plenty of character","We stayed in this riad for 2 nights at the end of our week's trip to Essaouira. The first 5 nights were spent in the medina, so we wanted to stay for a while at the other end of the long beach. Zahra and the riads at this end of the beach are better for people who want to enjoy the sporting activities on the beach (surfing, horse/camel riding, quad biking). If you would prefer to shop and eat, then stay in a riad within the medina at the other end. Zahra is a beautiful riad with very welcoming and friendly staff. Good breakfast although as I am gluten intolerant it was tough to find breakfast (lots of cakes, breads, pastries). But I am sure if you asked they would prepare something special. There is a lovely swimming pool of a good size. There are tortoises in the garden and…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2015,5,A Super Riad,"Never having been to Morocco before, we were not sure what to expect but we were more than pleasantly surprised by the wonderful welcome we received on arrival, the friendliness of the family ,Xavier, his wife and son, and the ambiance of the Riad.

The whole family is very friendly and attentive and nothing is too much trouble.Xavier says he loves his life and it shows! The Riad is a beautiful building with large bedrooms and two wonderful restaurants, where they didn't mind going off the menu to create something for us if we so desired. We never did get to eat any of the starters as we were always given tapas as an aperitif and by the time we had eaten that then the brilliant main course there was just about enough room for a delicious pudding. We drank them out of Gin a few times, but no problem, they had replenished it by the next day. Riad Zahra must be the most…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 March 2015,5,Dont think twice ...book now !,"Just wanted to offer my compliments and thanks to the fabulous family who own this beautiful riad . We have been welcomed and attended to with 5 star treatment since we arrived in Essaouira. The location is wonderful and the riad is spectacular, but as most reviewers agree, it is the hosts that make your stay so special . they are just lovely people who want to ensure that their guests have absolutely everything they need whilst in their care .

 April 2015,5,Best of all worlds,"Our family of four has just completed a fabulous 10 nights at Riad Zahra. With two small children we wanted somewhere quiet, with a pool, where we could choose to spend the whole day relaxing if we wanted. The location is great - just 2 minutes onto the best beachside cafes, where you can do all the watersports you like, or just loaf about eating and drinking. Then it's only 15 minutes walk (or £1 / E1.20 taxi in 2 mins) from all the action in the main town of Essauoira. Some days we did sightseeing, others we were able to sip cold beer poolside whilst the children played. Bliss! Xavier and his family provide a massive, friendly welcome.

 April 2015,5,Accomodation for joy!,"Hi guys! I was travelling alone to Essaouira mainly for surfing. Riad Zahra Hotel I settled in was, I think, one of the best hotels I've ever lived in, not form the point of luxury accessories in rooms, but from the point of unforgettable atmosphere which you will for sure enjoy for the whole stay, and kind, happy locals working there. Rooms are in classical Moroccan style, well furnished. Hotel has two restaurants, one of them (Zahra's Grill), I guess, has one of the best cuisine in town. Ones I watched how chef was cooking - pure art in its excellence!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,Loved it,"Loved this place! We ate here most nights as we were too lazy to walk down to the medina, the food portions were huge and they had the best spaghetti Bolognese ever!

Will definitely stay here again when I go back :)",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,Just the right place,"You will get what you have expected for a budgetable, comfortable, guest oriented, home alike accomodation. During our stay we came across to so many gestures that we felt as if we were in our friend's house. I haven't been accompanied to a dining room with greetings even in 5* hotels in every occasion. I hope this may give you the idea of fine management that they offer to their customers/guests (usually they call it as ""our families""). From top to bottom to all the stuff we are sending our best wishes and thanks for the invaluable attitude to ourselves during our stay. Don't miss it, do consider to reserve for a stay if you are planing to visit Essasouria/Morocco.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2015,4,3 nights,"Love this place, people, the staff everything is amazing. Some people have complained about breakfast which I fail to comprehend, if you want a 6star breakfast buffet then it's probably a good idea that you attend a 6star hotel and pay that price. Breakfast is sweet, one pancake, two bits of cake, some bread with the usual toppings and some fruit, I'm not aure what else you want with it? 20min walk to town which is cool (once you get over the fact that you'll have some scrote ask if you smoke or ""hashish?"") You get to pass all of the restaurant and surf shops allong the way which is very nice and even nicer are the people who work there.

 March 2015,5,Lovely Riad and great hosts,"Loved this Riad and the hosts are very helpful. The room was nice and comfortable bed. Received an email after booking about the building site next door....we still decided to stay here and Im glad we did because apart from a bit of noise in the daytime around the pool the building site didn't bother us. It was too cold to swim in the pool anyway so we went exploring most days to the medina or beach bars. Its a 20 minute walk from the medina but we'd just had similar in Marrakech and actually preferred it because you get to see more and things you wouldn't see if you stayed right in the town. The food at Zahra's grill on the roof Is to die for. We had prawns, clams and the lobster of the day and OMG it was some of the best seafood Ive ever had. It was quiet and we were the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,A change of pace.,"We stayed here after a bad night in an hotel in the old part of town. Well worth the money, a chance to sunbathe and swim without being sandblasted and annoyed by the beach peddlers. The lobby makes a great impression and the rooms are also impressive. Room had a view of a building site (can't be helped in some respects-progess!!!) but there was no noise or hindrance during our stay. Breakfast was standard Moroccan fare. But better. Nice coffee for example. Run by a lovely couple and yes, the pool area has turtles and tortoises.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2014,5,Very kind staff,"We stayed here for almost a week. After the chaos of Marrakech, it was very nice to relax here for a while. The owners are very friendly and made us feel at home. The pool is big and clean, the breakfast and Restaurant was perfect!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,"Warm welcome, excellent facilities","Had a very pleasant two night stay at Riad Zahra in January, low season. The first thing we noticed were how welcoming and helpful the staff were. The restaurant is very good and offers good value, with a different special each evening. We ate here both evenings. Breakfast was fine, nothing special but definitely satisfactory. Wifi was free, fast and reliable. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The location is good, just across from a nice part of the beach and about 20 minute's walk to the medina and harbour. Highly recommended!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2014,4,first experience in a riad,Riad Zahra was our first experience staying in a riad. It was beautifully restored and the host was welcoming and very friendly. Unfortunately ours was only a one night stay so we had little time to enjoy the amenities. We arrived late in the afternoon and checked out early in the next day. The breakfast room was beautiful and the meal delicious. My husband and I had a room on the first floor while the rest of our family (4) had upstairs rooms. I can only report on ours which was very comfortable. Our family had our own minibus and driver so he drove us to the medina that evening and to the fishing peer the next morning. Neither is to be missed. We were a bit disappointed that the riad was not in the medina but it worked out very well since we had our personal transport.…,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2014,5,Great week in Morocco and stay at Riad Zahra Essouira,"From the moment we entered the door it felt good at Riad Zahra. The owners are very friendly and hospitable. The villa is beautiful, in a quit place. Cross the street and you're on the great beach. Walk 20 mintes and your in the old fish harbour and medina. The bedroom in the Riad was great, the breakfast was excellent, the pool was great. I can't name anything bad, except for the rooster that kept on crowing at 4.30u in the morning. But after telling this, the next day it was gone (rooster tasted delicious). We stayed her for 4 nights, and felt like at home, but in a holiday way. The owners helped us well with the trips (camel ride, renting bike, reserving taxi)",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,Fantastic,"My partner and myself had a great stay at the Riad Zahra. The location is perfect. Walkable but far enough away from the medina but close to the ocean and bars and restaurants. We were able to wake up and see the ocean from our room. The room was spacious, clean and nicely decorated. However, what really made the place special was the people working there from the owners onward. Everyone was willing to go the extra mile and help when it came down to issues with our boarding passes or managing to leave our iPad in the room at 5 in the morn!! Really special place and we would defo return again.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Beautiful riad with a proper pool,"We weren't expecting to be in Essaouira at all but got diverted from our desert trip due to flooding! So this was a last minute booking by our local operator Atlas Trek Shop and we were extremely happy with their choice. Zahra is a lovely riad with huge rooms, beautiful furnishings and a courtyard/central staircase that would put many 5 star hotels to shame. The owners are a lovely Catalan couple - very friendly and helpful at all times. There is an excellent restaurant with reasonable prices and a decent selection of Moroccan wine. The early evening ""tapas special"" was a great deal. Its about a 20-25 minutes walk along the promenade to the gates of the Medina and the harbour - well lit and felt perfectly safe at night. All in all, highly recommended - and yes they really do…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2014,5,A great place to stay in Essaouira,"I stayed with a group for a few nights. The main spaces of the hotel are beautiful, be it the lobby/reception, to the dining areas, to the pool, or the rooftop restaurant. The food was great. The rooms were spacious and clean. The service was exceptional with everyone being very friendly. I enjoyed going to the restaurant on the rooftop and seeing the sunset. The Old Medina is a 15-20 minute walk that is quite nice as you go along the beach. The beach itself is not far from the hotel (a block, perhaps).",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Amazing Riad!,"Myself and my girlfriend had an incredible stay here for just one night - we would have loved to stay longer! The food was excellent, the service was amazing, and the room was gorgeous - highly reccomended!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Awesome stay! Would love to visit again,"I really enjoyed my stay in Riad Zahra Mogador. The riad is a short 20-30 minute walk from the medina which we didn't mind walking since the weather was so nice and you could walk along the beach. There are turtles in the pool! Yes, turtles. The pool itself is very calm and relaxing with lots of greenery. The service was one of the highlights of the trip. Xavier helped us out a lot with directions, calling a cab for us, organizing excursions, etc. He's always smiling and was very friendly. Since our bus back to Marrakech was in the evening, he looked after our bags until then. The food was good too. The breakfast had an assortment of fruit, breads, jams, coffee, juice and yoghurt. We had dinner one night at the riad and that too was lovely -- hummus, monkfish and Moroccan…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,"Lovely Riad, Great location, will definitely return!!","We have just returned from a lovely weeks stay at Riad Zahra. We arrived after a busy 3 days in Marrakech and was looking forward to some relaxation...we weren't disappointed! Our room was big and clean, and had a lovely view over the swimming pool and across to the beach. After getting settled, we had a quick tour of the Riad, before my children could wait no longer and hit the pool!! The turtles and tortoises were very popular with the children, the staff in the kitchen handed out lettuce so we could feed them!! The staff were all very welcoming and friendly, able to offer suggestions and advice about activities on offer in the town. The location was fantastic, 5 minutes from the beach, and 30 - 40 minutes to the medina (2 small children make any walk longer!) We ate in…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Lovely Riad with great staff,"We looked and looked in Essaouira before booking the Riad Zahra, and glad we did. The whole experience was great, very very pleasant owners who went above and beyond to make you feel welcome, very informative. I liked the way, they took to your room and let you settle in before you went out and explored. Breakfast was a great feature, filled you up for the day, drinks at pool were well priced and internet was good, loved the turtles at the pool. Would come back here for sure. It is about a 15 minute walk to centre of town, but the walk is along the beach, so it makes for an enjoyable walk.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,Honeymoon relaxing,"We spent 3 nights at the Riad Zahara in September after a manic 5 nights in Marrakech and I suspect it won't be long until we're back. We arrived off the Supratours bus (highly recommended!) and as we had rucksacks, decided not to get a taxi but instead walk along the waterfront. From the centre of town (next to the medina) it's about a 25 minute walk or so along the most beautiful seafront to the riad. It's easy to spot with lots of signs, set just off the main road and just a 2 minute walk from a gorgeous, long sandy beach. We were welcomed by the concierge and owner almost as soon as we arrived and after a quick tour were shown our room - a sea view on the first floor. The room was huge, clean with a big window overlooking the pool and over to the beach. It has a great shower…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,Great Riad,"A lovely quiet Riad close to the beach but within a 25 minute leisurely stroll along the attractive promenade to the Medina. The location could not have been better for us as we were kitesurfing and this riad is very close to a couple of hire places (we were with Explora). The owners and their son were kind and helpful, accommodating our extra nights stay with ease. The room (number 20) was big and comfortable in Moroccan style. The whole Riad had a lovely feel. It also has a pool (complete with turtles) and nice poolside area if you want to relax. Breakfast is big and filling and lunches good with large choice. We did not eat here in the evening but I understand it has a great reputation (it was fully booked the one night we did think about it). If back in Essaouira I would…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,Pleasant Dinner,"After looking up restaurants on Trip Advisor while in Essaoiura, we saw the Riad Zahra and made the short walk from our hotel along the beachfront. Upon arriving, we were greeted and told they have two restaurants. We opted for the fish restaurant, so were taken up to the top floor. A lovely restaurant overlooking the pool below (complete with turtles!) and beach; perfect to enjoy the sunset too! The food was fresh and very enjoyable and would recommend visiting. Service was prompt and friendly. Thank you for a pleasant evening.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2014,5,Home from home : a blissful break,We love this little family owned hotel so much we go back regularly. Delighfully designed and furnished the downstairs dining rooms can be intimate or more open. The top storey fish and meat grill restaurant is splendid with gorgeous views over the sea. Food in both excellent and service can't be faulted. You relax by the swimming pool or on the terrace overlooking it : accompanied by three small turtles ! And tapas snacks available all day. A range of bedrooms all well furnished and delightfully decorated (beds a tiny bit small and hard for us - but we're used to a very big one at home!); good shower/WC rooms. The entrance and public spaces are warm and friendly with great atmosphere. Everything is spotlessly clean. But top of everything is the welcome by the owners (and their…,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2014,5,A relaxing stay outside the city center and its crowded Souk,"We really enjoyed our stay since its location is outside the noisy center of Essaouira, and only 3 mins away from the beach! We loved the big pool with its three little friendly turtles! This might sound like a tiny detail but they sell beers at the bar! Believe me we never enjoyed a beer that much especially since we had spent the two previous weeks in morocco drinking only soft beverage... The couple who runs this Riad is really nice and gave us great tips to help us to pursue our trip in the best conditions.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2014,5,Great hotel! Great location and just the way it should be,"I stayed in Riad Zahra on a short holiday in Essaouira. It was a last minute booking and we didnt expect too much but it certainly excided our expectations. The hotel was very clean and neat and the stuff super helpfull with every little thing we needed. Our room was on the ground floor which i didnt like at first but it was so big and nice and beautifully decorated that i didnt mind at all after all. The breakfast, the pool and the restaurants were great as well. Also it is just a short walk from the Medina, really close but far enough not to be in the fuss of the center. I would definetelly go back if I have the chance!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2013,5,Very nice place,This place is just a few minutes away from the beach. The room is confortable and clean and the view from the restaurant is amazing. The staff is fanstastic and they went well over any aspectative. I would raccomend this place!!!,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2014,5,Nice place and good food,"This is a lovely Riad about 15 minutes sea front walk from the Medina. The hosts are very nice and friendly people and the service is great. It has two restaurants with very good food and breakfast is lovely, the best I had during my Moroccan tour. I would definitely recommend it to family and friends.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2014,5,Beautiful Riad,"We came to Essaouira for the main purpose of Kitesurfing, so decided to stay at this Riad as it was close to the kite school and had great reviews.It certainly didn't disappoint. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. The rooms were traditional and clean, the pool area was lovely - the turtles living around the pool were such a special touch! The restaurants were very nice and the food exceptional. It is around a 20 minute stroll to the Medina and just minutes to the beach. This stunning, traditional Riad lived up to my expectations and I would definitely recommend for people to stay! If I return to Essaouira I would definitely stay at the Riad Zahra :-)",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2014,5,Riad Zahra 1-10 July 2014,"The primary reason for our trip was kitesurfing/surfing . I found the staff at this facility excellent , always there when you needed them and couldn't be more accommodating. there are two excellent restaurants on site which serve delicious food at a reasonable price.the included breakfast is basic but tastes great The rooms are cleaned daily and to a high standard Its a 2 minute walk to the beach and a 15 minute walk to the Medina. The Riad will also arrange excursions upon request The pool area is clean and well laid out , there are also resident turtles in/around the pool which is a nice touch. All in all I highly recommend this Riad to people looking to kitesurf and explore the Medina as well as families",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2014,5,Stunning Riad and fabulous owners/staff,"I stayed in Riad Zahra with my mum in late June and I can't recommend it enough. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel incredibly welcome and every part of our experience was wonderful. I primarily came to kite surf in Essaouira and after being recommended Riad Zahra by the owners of Explora it exceeded our expectations. The Riad itself is beautiful, the owners are superbly friendly and the staff are exceptional. The whole place has an incredibly positive vibe and it was a fantastic experience. The food is sensational and it is easily one of the best experiences I have ever had on holiday and I have travelled a lot. I think the part I loved the most was the genuine warmth of each and every staff member we met... was a very refreshing experience. I 100%+…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2014,5,If you are thinking of Essaouira then stay at Riad Zahra,"After a four night stay in the heat and excitement of Marrakech we travelled to Essaouira in a private car organised for us by Xavier at Riad Zahra. We had stayed at the truly excellent and twice as expensive Riad Noga in Marrakech and expected a lower standard at the Zahra. Yes, the Noga was a more sumptuous property but the Zahra did not disappoint in any way at all. A low key but friendly welcome set the tone for a great five night stay for my wife and I together with our two sons. Our room (no.20) was side room with balcony and was spotless and tastefully decorated. Our lads had a smaller room but again it was excellent. We ate in the top floor restaurant on our first and last nights and the food is truly excellent. Run by the owners son it is a small but superb place…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2014,5,Beautiful riad with wonderful owners and delicious food!,"We arrived at the riad a few hours before check in and were greeted very warmly by the owner, given a tour of the grounds and made to feel very welcome by the pool whilst our room was prepared. The grounds are nicely planted and there is a sizeable swimming pool, which was normally dotted with three resident tortoises - quite the attraction in themselves! The room was on the ground floor and was spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated. Regarding meals, there was always a good choice at breakfast and we dined poolside most days as the lunch menu was delicious and the service was always impeccable. We took evening meals in the fish restaurant upstairs, where the dishes were always cooked to perfection and we ate some of the best fish courses we have ever eaten here. If you…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2014,5,quiet with beautiful views and an owner that cares.,We stayed here for 3 nights. Had a mini suite with a view of the ocean and pool. My partner was on crutches and they made us very comfortable. The owner and staff are always around making sure everything is perfect for your visit. The food in both restaurants was superb. This hotel is a 15 -20 min walk along a beautiful promanade to the medina. But the beach is right across the street. they have an unheated pool that is protected against the wind. Would definitely recomend this place to everyone. And make sure you eat upstairs at the grill restaurant. Beer is always cold!!!,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Wonderful hotel run by wonderful people,"We stayed here for a few relaxing days. Staff was present in a very pleasant way: always friendly & helpful taking care of us. The room was nice & spacious with ocean view. The swimming pool was great, especially with the turtles/tortoises around/in the pool. The kids really were enjoying being around these animals. Also nice to have a choice of two restaurants. A good restaurant next to the swimming pool, and a really excellent roof-top restaurant. The breakfast was very nice as well, with good/fresh food being served at the table. It was about 15 minutes walking next to (or on) the beach to the old city center. We really enjoyed our stay here and can definitely highly recommend it for a pleasant stay in Essaouira!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2014,3,Overall a good stay..,"We visited Essaouira at the beginning of May and stayed in Riad Zahra for 5 nights. We arrived quite late (around half 10pm) and were very pleased that we still could have a dinner in the spanish restaurant upstairs. The staff in Zahra is really helpful and lovely. The restaurant itself is fine, but the food was very plane and tasteless. We didn't give this restaurant another chance and were dining out every other night (there is a good bar on the beach,2min walk from the Riad, - The Beach with Friends - where you can chill with glass of wine and pizza). Our room was quite basic with very tiny TV, but very clean. There is a nice indoor and outdour launch/bar downstairs next to the pool where we spent majority of time reading books and drinking mint tea. Breakfast is average and…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2014,3,Not what we were expecting from a riad,"This is not a intimate riad, it's more a small hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful but the room was a bit mean, and decoration sparse and uninspiring. Felt like it needed a good lick of paint and certainly the curtains did not keep out the light. Also no air con. Maybe we were spoiled buy having stayed at some fabulous riads in the country earlier on our trip and at the coast things are a bit different.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Windsurfing in Essaouira,"We travel to Essaouira each year for a Windwise.net windsurfing trip and always use Riad Zahra as our base. It's a brilliantly run family hotel with a really warm welcome. The staff service is always superb and very personal, which makes our stay so much more welcoming. Whether it's tapas by the pool or sunset view for dinner, the food and atmosphere is superb after a full day no the water. Our clients love it and we look forward to return for many years to come!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2014,3,Riad Zahra,"We stayed at Riad Zahra in early April. We found the staff very pleasant and willing to assist. The room was a little basic and the plumbing could have been better, the shower kept changing temperature. The outdoor swimming was however a blessing and the restaurants and food were very appetizing, breakfast, lunch and dinner.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Wonderful,"We liked the fact that this hotel was far enough away from the medina to be quiet and so close to the beach that we had some lovely walks there but what made it really special was the people. They were so friendly and welcoming that it made our lovely stay even better. They gave us a map and explained how to get to different places, greeted us every time we passed reception and even allowed us to check in for our flights and print off our boarding passes on our last day. They really do go above and beyond what is normally found in hotels. The pool area is lovely, although we weren't very lucky with the weather! We loved the tortoises and turtles around the pool - adorable! Thank you Riad Zahra - we loved our stay with you.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Excellent hotel,"Our stay in Riad Zahra was truly wonderful. Clean spacious rooms, delicious breakfast and friendly staff and owners. The fish restaurant at the top of the hotel with views across the beach was immense and the food amazing. The hotel is a 2 min walk away from the kite surfing beach and the owners are happy to look after any kit. The town is about 20min walk away or a cheap taxi (8 dirhams).",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,lovely hotel great people,"myself and friend where recommended the hotel through a friend. the main reason for our visit was for kitesurfing. I enquired by email (quite a few as I was undecided on dates) and each time I got a quick and helpful response. The hotel rates are very reasonable and exceeded all my expectations. The location was perfect for the beach and also a nice 15 minute walk to the town centre. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The mini suite we stayed in was gorgeous. room was extremely clean. we ate in the restuarant and food was lovely, reasonable price and great service.

 April 2014,3,Very friendly - great for the beach,"We stayed at Riad Zara for 4 nights - it is close to the beach which is great and about 20/25 Min walk into town but taxis only cost 20 dirhams - but ....only take 3 passengers!! We enjoyed the walk. The owners were lovely and friendly- my daughter was fascinated by the turtles in the pool and the tortoises around the pool- some guests didnt notice the difference,,!! Our room was a big one for the 4 of us but on the ground floor right next to reception which actually was relatively quiet in the evenings but a bit noisy in the mornings. We didnt have an evening meal at the hotel - the menu looked nice but pricey. Breakfast was adequate but service quite poor- even though friendly.We had to ask for spoons every morning / the tea pot for 4 had 1 weak tea bag so we asked for…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,A warm welcoming and friendly riad.,"Our stay at Riad Zahra was made memorable by the incredibly warm hospitality offered by the owners and staff. Thank you for helping make my wife's 30th birthday a fantastic day by helping book the camel trek and spa treatment. Every time we came through the day we were made to feel like we were the only people staying in the Riad by being greeted with a friendly face and a ""How are you? Is everything ok?"" The steak at the restaurant upstairs was delicious. The room was clean and comfortable and the pool was well maintained. It was also also great to see some of the local wildlife lazing around the pool - 2 turtles who roam around the pool sunning themselves. I would definitely recommend Riad Zahra for value for money and the location is great, being a 5 minute walk from the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Lovely family run riad with amazing staff,The owners could not have been more helpful. Even sending a lost item back to England for us. They service is impeccable and the rooms were clean and comfortable. It's 15 min walk from the main city bits and 1 min from the beach. The pool area is nice but the pool is cold (nice in the summer but a little too cold for march). Free tapas with your beer between 6-7pm and the food was good. We'd reccomend it for anyone looking for a relaxing stay.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2013,5,"Wonderful, homelike place","This hotel is so great because of the owner and his family - they make you feel welcome and at home. And yes, the location is great too. This is the second time we have stayed here and we were very happy to find out that they had added a restaurant on the top floor. It was wonderful! The place is by the beach, withing walking distance of the medina. There is parking on the premise. The breakfast is wonderful. The only issue, that I wish they would do something about, is to get softer mattresses. The beds are very hard to sleep on.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Amazing hospitality in a beautiful Riad by the beach,"My partner and I just spent a fantastic week at the Riad Zahra. We were not planning to stay so long but Essaouira was incredible and the Riad Zahra was such a wonderful place to stay and relax, we didn't want to go anywhere else. It's location is by the beach where it's beautiful and quiet in the mornings and brimming with activity in the afternoons. Then you can head over to the Medina and Port for exciting and stimulating Moroccan experiences. The best of both worlds. We mostly came for the kitesurfing but the whole city and experience gave us everything we wanted and needed from a holiday and a bit of travelling. It's run by a super friendly, helpful and smiling family who went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and as comfortable as possible. It was a real…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,I wouldn't change a thing.,"I've just spent a week at the Riad Zahra. The main purpose of the trip was to get away for my birthday and kitesurf in the lovely Essaouira bay. The Riad Zahra came highly recommended and I can see why. Located just off the beach, it's somewhere between a hotel and a guest house, run by a fantasically friendly and helpful family. The restaurant is open to non-guests and has some excellent food at relatively good prices. I will stay there again.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2014,5,"Winter sun, comfortable Riad","Spent a very relaxing 10 days on a yoga holiday at Riad Zahra in the warm winter sun of February.

 March 2014,4,"Pleasant stay in a lovely, traditional Riad","My partner and I visited Essaouira for a kitesurfing holiday, as the wind here is very consistent. Having chosen Riad Zahra for its close proximity to the beach, we were pleased with our choice. We found the owners to be friendly, helpful and always willing to greet you with a smile. The restaurant staff were also friendly and attentive and when I informed the young man who served us breakfast that it was my partner's birthday, he obliged by bringing out a delicious cake - complete with candles. Nothing was too much trouble. What a lovely guy! The riad itself is tastefully decorated in a traditional, Moroccan style and the mini suite we stayed in was perfect for our needs.

 February 2014,2,Disappointing,"After staying in two lovely riads in Morocco, myself and my boyfriend were really looking forward to coming to the coastal town of Essouira for 2 nights. On arrival at Riad Zahra, we were disappointed to be greeted lukewarmly at best: the receptionist bluntly demanded our passports, and while I searched in my bag for them, she did not make any polite conversation with my boyfriend or myself, ask how our trip was, or offer any information about Essouria or indeed even offer us a cup of tea or give us a chance to catch our breath! We were then led up two flights of stairs to a very small bedroom, the smallest we stayed in in morocco, despite it being double the price of other riads we had stayed in. It appeared to be looking onto a old block of flats and a car park. The shower…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 February 2014,4,Good value hotel in Essaouira,"My parents, daughter, & I stayed at the Riad Zahra in Essaouira for one night. The hotel is a block from the beach, which was convenient. However, the rooms are fairly basic - but the price was also very reasonable. There's a large pool (although our February visit precluded anything more than taking a look at it), and the included breakfast was fresh and prompt.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2014,5,Distinctive Service,"We arrived at Riad Zahra on a cold and rainy day to what was fortunately a very service oriented receptionist. The heater in our room was insufficient to take the chill out of the room but on being told of this, within minutes the receptionist found two heaters for us that worked better than the first. It took less than an hour before we were able to send a second heater back and enjoyed the remaining 5 days in comfort. This standard of service was displayed by all staff throughout our stay. Our room was kept spotless and the restaurant staff was attentive. This Riad is along the waterfront about a 20 minute pleasurable walk from the old Medina. If we were too tired for the return leg, the ‘petit taxis’ are plentiful and cost only 7 dirhams. We were in one of the smaller…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2013,3,We liked the turtles but don't have many good memories of this hotel,"We stayed in some wonderful hotels and gites in Morocco so perhaps our expectations were high, but we found the owners only grudgingly interested in us as guests, the pool freezing, the cockerels too noisy to sleep, the food mediocre and the whole experience so bereft of humanity it made us melancholy. My daughter ate some reheated pancakes they served - only partially reheated. If I know I've recieved reheated food I normally insist it is heated to piping as working with microbiologists I am aware of the dangers, but as they were only chocolate pancakes and the service was so grudging I didn't want to be a pain. My daughter was vomiting with food poisoning for the rest of our stay and it lingered for so long even when back in England she was offered a hospital bed. Some people…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,Lovely Place,"Had a wonderful stay here with my family of six at the end of our trip. Very comfortable rooms with great views of the beach. Xavier was extremely helpful to work with and was very accommodating with our room choices as well as arranging transportation. We loved being on the beach and found the walk (20 minutes along the beach to the medina) no problem. The kids had a great surfing lesson arranged right at the surf shop attached to the Riad. The action on the beach is unbelievable to watch and very entertaining. There was a wonderful New Year Eve's celebration with great food, music and entertainment-glad we didn't go anywhere else!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2014,5,"Friendly, relaxing Riad Zahra","I chose the Riad because apparently it was designed by the same architect who built the legendary Mamounia Hotel in Marrakech. It was the perfect choice with a gracious entrance, traditional feel and sea views. Owner Xavier's response - at very short notice - and helpfulness by email (including a YouTube of the Riad) couldn't have been better. We could pay a very reasonable deposit by secure payment system in advance which was reassuring. Essaouira is 2 1/2 to 3 hours drive from Marrakech, by the way (I didn't realise when I booked our flights!) so transport to and from Marrakech ended up being quite expensive. The location was great, being about a 20 minute stroll to the Medina (old town) and the ocean roar being the main sound to be heard. The restaurant was good and the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,Perfect place to stay to experience Essaouira,"We stayed here for 7 nights over New Year and it was perfect for us. Owners and staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, food was good and the decor and atmosphere attractive. It is a walk to the medina (only 15-20 minutes) but that's actually fun as you walk along the seafront. You are also close to the better part of the beach for walking (and for the camels and horses). So you can experience both the beach scene and the medina. Loved the pool area and even managed one rather chilly swim. Lovely stay, thoroughly recommended by us.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2014,5,Great place to relax after the stresses of morocco,"A wonderful place run by a lovely couple who were helpful and kind whilst letting you get on with your holiday in piece. The staff were all very friendly, the pool was too cold to get in but thats because its winter, looks great though and the resident tortoises didn't seem to mind going for a dip. Rooms were basic but nice, great shower after some fairly ropey experiences elsewhere that was a nice. It exceeds what it is trying to be, good value for money.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2014,4,Riad where you feel welcome And At home. Swim with The turtles in The swimmingpool...,"This riad contains all you Need, visiting Essaouira. After 15 days of dessert in Nomadic land i extended my trip here for two nights in this riad. Perfect location close To The beach, but The medina is kind of a walk (20 minutes or take a 7 dirham taxi) Fantastic pool With turtles to swim With. And a very good restaurant. Aks for The crème vegetable soup, outstanding!! Edith And Xavier (The owners) are always there To help you. Highly recommended! A top 10 choice!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2014,5,Perfect hotel right by the beach,"We spend a few days here after travelling around Morocco, and it was the perfect place to relax for a few days in the sun. The hotel is perfectly located right by the beach, and so great for people who want to kitesurf, surf or just relax at the many beachfront restaurants. Our room was great - we had the most basic (standard price) which was lovely, and had a giant walk in shower with plenty of hot water. The staff were very friendly, especially the owners who were always around to answer queries or recommend restaurants. The service in the restaurant and bar was also top notch. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, and very much hope to return. Thank you for the perfect end to our trip!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,"Great location, friendly and welcoming","We booked Riad Zahra after staying here last year. Although we like to stay in different places we were looking for somewhere comfortable for a couple of nights to relax and take stock from a work / road trip. The riad is in a great location, a few minutes walk from the beach and a short walk from the Medina and port. We had a car so it was nice being able to park it outside. Being out of season there were only a hand full of guests staying so it lacked a little of the bubbly family atmosphere it had on our last stay, but all the staff were very friendly and happy to accommodate anything we wanted. The room was comfy and warm with extra blankets and a heater provided. Extremely powerful hot shower and clean towels everyday. We ate in the bar both nights of our stay, the food was…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,"Perfect Morrocan experience, totally relaxing environment !","We got this Riad as a recommendation from some kitesurfing friends who stayed in May . Myself and my son Stayed for 16 days in November Xavier and his staff could not have done more to help and make our first trip to essaouira more pleasant. We went to surf, kitesurf and play golf. The surf was great almost every day, only three days of wind. The golf course was fantastic though expensive at £75 The Riad was spotless, the pool area was like a tranquil oasis. The pool was really cold but refreshing. The maid service was exceptional every day. Lovely as the place is it was the professionalism of the staff that stood out, nothing was to much trouble and an amazing ability to make you feel at home. Kind regards Tim and Brad Spring",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2013,5,Very welcoming,"We stayed here for a few nights on our honeymoon. After the chaos of Marrakech it was nice to relax and get our energy back. The staff and owners were very friendly and helpful, despite our poor French. We ate at the Riad every night and found the food was delicious and well priced. Watching the sunset with a cool beer and seafood in the grill was a real highlight of the stay. We nearly decided to cancel our return trip to Marrakech and stay on in Essaouira because it was so lovely.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,Great value Riad,"A lovely Riad with a beautiful and charming central courtyard. The owners and their staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful and the facilities and pool were excellent. Our room was clean and comfortable with a view over the pool to the beach in the distance. Breakfasts were good, and we had dinner in both the downstairs and upper restaurants; both were excellent! Location was good, just a few minutes from the beach and with taxis costing a fixed fare of 8 dirhams (£0.61) in central Essaouira, it was cheap and easy to get around and visit the old Medina, fish market and harbour.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2013,4,Home from home family run hotel,"Stayed for a week and the owners and staff were excellent. All extremely friendly and helpful. Food good throughout the stay; the owners eat all their meals in the hotel restaurant which adds to the relaxed atmosphere. The upstairs grill restaurant was even more impressive. And the food costs are on a par with other locations, but typically better quality. 20 mins walk to the medina - but this is not a necessarily bad thing. Other tips: Ranch Diabet for horse riding (see web site). Great harbour views from hotel bar next to Taras restaurant; access via the inner walls. Recommend a meal at one of the 'huts' near the harbour; good local fish. Lots of choice for good, and good value food in the Medina. If you like a hike (not a walk), suggest the Al Qalb monument on Azlef…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2013,4,Kindness,"We did try and enjoy our selves but I was becoming ill . The Riad is very nice and our room was clean. The pool area clean and very nice . Breakfast ok . We would go back the staff were very helpful we were checking out and I had to see a doctor . In the end the reception arranged for him to come to our room ( we were leaving ) He was English speaking and very good I needed antibiotics . So I was grateful for the service , and the local Doctor they used . Thank you Riad Zahra.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2013,5,"great food, great staff, great pool","I would definitely recommend this riad. It had friendly and helpful staff, a lovely ground floor terrace with a swimming pool, great breakfasts. All in all a lovely riad located a 5 minutes walk away from the beach but 15 mins walk from the Medina. The grill restaurant on the top floor was the best food we had in our 2 weeks in Morocco.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2013,4,Good value friendly hotel.,Stayed for 6 nights for a bit of r & r after couple days in Marrakesh & traveling in the Atlas mountains. Hotel has a nice chilled atmosphere & the owners are very friendly & helpful. Good location close to the beach. Its away from the main area but only 25min walk or 50p taxi ride to the Medina & restaurants. Nice clean pool area with plenty of sun beds & sun most of the day & out of the wind. Had booked basic room but wish we had realized that there were larger rooms with balconies. Unfortunately none available when we arrived. Our room over the reception was quite noisy & the bed was very hard & uncomfortable. Also very light in the morning as south facing & thin curtains. Good stay & would come back..,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2013,5,Perfect place to chill out,"Stayed here for a week on a kite surfing holiday. The hotel has great atmosphere, very friendly and helpful staff. There is a pool, lounge and two restaurants. Location is perfect for beach access with several surfing schools just around the corner.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2013,5,Perfect relaxing place,"We went to Riad Zahra for the third time. That sais it all. It's the mix between the more than friendly owners, the good food in the restaurants ( two!!), the fresh fish is to dy for, the open pool, and its very near the beach. The prices are more than acceptable. So, à place to look for when going to Essaouira.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2013,4,Nice rooms and friendly staff,"The hotel as a whole has a nice ambiance rooms are big and spacious, colorful and well lit. There is a problem with the toilets and the stink inside. The toilet in my room was leaking in the roof, that could have caused the stink. Walking distance from the old Medina. Staff was friendly but the food was a bit lousy and meager. On the whole a good place if you are not expecting very high standards.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2013,2,Could be better!,"Rhiad Zhara has a reputation for being a stylish Rhiad 5 minutes taxi ride, 25 mins walk from the old Medina. (8 dirhams). However there are issues that we feel need to be highlighted and resolved. We stayed at The Rhiad for 4 nights on recommendations from trip adviser in room 21 The Rhiad Zhara provided us with a very hard mattress that had a large hollow due to not being turned regularly. This ensured a very bad nights sleep although the manager tried to rectify by adding two mattresses on top !! The terrace toilet above our room had a leaking toilet system above which kept us awake The breakfast is very uninspiring consisting of bread rolls two dairy lee cheese segments , very small crepe with honey and jam... Fruit was provided which was ok but peaches where unripe…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2013,3,A nice standard,"Located 20-30mins walk from Medina, sea view from some rooms, parking in front of the hotel (free of charge), helpful assistance, the room ok, just the stink coming from the toilette was disturbing (once the door closed, all fine), bed covers / blankets 100% clean, helpful and friendly reception staff, there are two restaurants in the riad (ok), nice breakfast",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2013,5,"practically perfect relaxation - great for friends, families and kitesurfers","This charming riad in Essaouira is so calm and welcoming it feels like home from the moment you walk through the doors. Set back from the main road in a quiet street with its own parking, Riad Zahra is a 2 minute walk from the amazing beach. Strolling along the sea front at a gentle pace will take about 15 minutes to reach the medina and harbour. Xavier, the proprietor is gently hospitable and with his family and staff take care of every detail in an unfussy way. The rooms are comfortable and many have a balcony (or 2). Breakfast is simple and plentiful and both restaurants serve delicious food. Make sure you dine one evening in the rooftop restaurant where the catch of the day is grilled to your liking with superb views of the bay - I would recommend reserving a table…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2013,5,Great place with excellent staff,I would recommend this hotel to fellow travellers. We stayed for 10 nights and booked an extra night as we enjoyed it so much. There are plenty if local restaurants and two good ones in Riad Zahara itself. There's a gorgeous beach 2 minutes walk away and the town centre is a 15 minute walk away. Taxis are easy to get and a good price if you haggle.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2013,5,Amazing !,"I didn't stay here I only ate here at the restaurant and it was beautiful ! It was fairly empty so we had one to one choice of our food with the chef, the waiter was very pleasant and polite . The food was beautiful we chose our own lobster and personalised our meals. The owner was very nice and accommodating . Would 100% recommend the restaurant !",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2013,3,"Nice Riad, with some good and not so good bits","Had mixed feelings about Riad Zahra. The good bits: the staff! Xavier was very welcoming, helpful and spoke perfect English and many other languages. And the young Moroccan guy that worked in the restaurants was so lovely and charming, with beautiful English was very informative. Lovely restaurant areas both up and downstairs, the best breakfast on all of our Morocco trip and good large pool with turtles! So unique! And the whole place is very very clean, which is the most important thing to me when travelling. The bits I didn't really like we're the room we were in. It looked over the carpark and was over the reception and was so noisy and felt a bit dingy. I am a light sleeper and could hear every time someone came and went, spoke, parked a car, drove past etc. the whole…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2013,5,Family holiday,"My wife and I and our young son stayed at Riad Zahra for 6 nights in August 2013 as part of a 2 centre holiday to Morocco. The hotel is ideally situated close to the beach for kite & windsurfing and a short (1.50GBP) taxi ride (or a 20 minute walk) from the old town. The room we stayed in was spacious and clean and the shower always produced ""properly hot"" water. The food at breakfast was always fantastic with fresh fruit, especially copious amounts of wonderful tasting melon. The wifi, although not brilliant in the room, was more than adequately fast when seated in the reception, allowing us to stay in contact with family and customers back home. However, it was the exceptional service provided by Xavier & his staff throughout our stay which left the greatest impression and…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2013,4,Friendly staff in a great beach location,We stayed here for five days in Aug 2013 and we were very happy with the staff and the location of the riad couldn't have been any better with a 5 min walk to the beach. The room was clean and tidy and the whole riad was decorated in Spanish influence. Due to its standards there were a lot of guests coming and going and due to our room being above the riad reception there were times in the night which it was very noisy but overall a great break and would recommend especially if you could get a sea view room,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2013,4,Wonderful and Relaxing Stay,"Staying at the Riad Zahra wonderful and relaxing experience. It is a large riad (more like a hotel) with over 20 rooms, a spacious dining room, a pool (the best part!), and a restaurant. From the minute we arrived, we felt welcome and relaxed. The riad really is right on the beach, and we could see the ocean from our room. As others have mentioned, the beach was quite windy (a welcome change after experiencing the intense heat in Marrakech), so we didn't end up doing much sunbathing or swimming on the beach (thought it seemed excellent for water sports!). However, we took a several pleasant walks along the beach, and it was just a 10 minute walk from the Riad along the beach into the center of town. You can also take a very quick/inexpensive taxi. Our room was very large and…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2013,4,great,"Friendly staff, nice pool, great breakfast, cheap lunch and dinner options, nicely decorated rooms, beautiful central courtyard area.

 July 2013,5,Great place to relax and unwind,"Like many of the reviewers here, I found the Riad Zahra is a wonderful and welcoming place to stay – I had a very chilled out week here on my own. The rooms, main building, pool and restaurant are maintained to a very high standard by a very friendly and professional team. Xavier, his wife and son and all of the staff cannot do enough to help you and make you feel as though you are are staying at a home away from home. The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated in a traditional Moroccan style, and the ambience is very relaxed and friendly.

 July 2013,5,Riad Zahara,"This hotel was faultless, however, we did leave early as we went for the wind and sadly we hit the only time for ages there was none! :-( We exhausted other activities and not only did we have no wind the weather was poor, the sun shone for max 2 hours over 5 days, and there was an awful sea mist that kept rolling in. So that aside, my view on the hotel was fabulous, the owners were brilliant and very sympathetic to us and always had a smile on their faces, and worked extremely long hours. The rooms were spotless and maintained to an excellent level. Breakfast was plentiful, and the restaurant food both upstairs and down was great. We ate there several times and always had something different. They also went the extra mile whilst were there as we wanted to watch the tennis…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

They also helped us organise a camel ride and quad biking and made it very easy for us. Breakfast and dinner was also lovely, with speciality Moroccan dishes that were delicious. The pool was also large and had turtles in them, which was a pleasant surprise and made swimming all the more fun! The room itself was quite quaint and had a traditional feel to it. Everything was really clean and spacious too. Also location is perfect as it is situated on a quiet part of the beach so there is little noise in the evenings; yet it is still only a 10-15 minute walk to the main medina and practically situated on the beach itself.

I've been travelling a lot in my life and I will always remember Riad Zahra as one of my highlights, especially regarding being so welcome, the beautiful house, the spacious rooms, the combination of professionality&easy-going plus the thing I cannot really put in words: feeling home after just a couple of days!

 May 2013,5,Lovely informal Riad in Essaouira.,"I stayed in the Riad Zahra, one of a group of 11 windsurfers, during the first week in May 2013. We arrived from the airport very late at night, tired and ready for sleep. We were greeted very courteously and shown to our rooms with no delay. I shared a twin room which was plenty large enough although, to be honest, was a bit short on space for two people's clothing etc. The decoration is delightful and photos on this site give a taste of the local style. The en-suite bathroom was clean and charming with Moorish appeal. In the light of day, the interior of the hotel is beautiful with a grand entrance hall, foyer and staircase. There are huge palms and ferns reaching right up the second floor and paintings by a local artist all over the walls. Breakfast was served in…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2013,5,Perfect Riad for a Kitetrip,"A perfect spot for a kitetrip in Essaouira, located very close to the beach. The rooms are big, the breakfast is the best & the owner, his son and all the other staff who work there are very kind, all really nice people. They make you feel like home immediately and they help you with anything, anytime, always! There are also a few shelves with books you may read (all kind of languages), which was a great solution when I finished my book ☺. The kiteschool next to the riad is very good too. Great teacher and helpful staff. If there’s no wind to do watersports, you can relax at the pool & in 5 min (cheap taxi) you’re in the Medina. I do absolutely recommend this Riad to all kiters who are planning a trip to Essaouira! And hopefully I come back there once myself!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2013,5,Great location for watersports,My family and I have just returned from 5 nights stay at Riad Zahra really great location if you want to take part in water sports and the taxi to the Medina in the evening is 50p so no big deal. Excellent hospitality with a lovely breakfast each morning.

 May 2013,5,Sensational riad & wonderful staff,"Just spent six nights @ Riad Zahra & cannot speak highly enough of the place, the management, & staff. The riad is 250 meters from the beach & was the perfect location for us as we were in Essaouira to go kite boarding. Our room overlooked the pool & gave us sweeping views of the beach. There are two restaurants within the Riad & each served great food, especially the afternoon happy hour/tapas. Xaivier (the owner) is/was wonderfully polite & engaging and cannot be faulted for how the place runs. His son Jofrey gave us really useful local knowledge about the beach & for kiting.

The large swimming pool is an added bonus despite the cool temperature, & you might find yourself sharing it with the small resident turtle! It is about 20 mins walk into the Medina......great going barefoot on the beach or less than a £1 by local taxi.

The price is very low but the quality is very high! The food is great, you can have lunch at any time in the swimming pool and great grill meat and fish (always fresh) on the terrace, which has an astonishing view.

 May 2013,5,"Great staff, great food, great hotel",We stayed at Riad Zahra for 10 nights in May. As far as hotels go it is one of the best experiences I have ever had. The staff can't do enough for you. It is a family run hotel and you really get that personal touch that the big chain hotels can't deliver. The food in the restaurant is of a very high standard and very reasonably priced. The hotel itself is beautifully presented and the terrapins in the pool are adorable.

The rooms were really nice moroccan style, the food was amazing we had tapas everyday and eating in the restaurant there are panoramic views of the whole bay.

 March 2013,5,"Friendly, personal and accommodating place to stay","We came to this Riad as a group of kitesurfers and were lucky to stay somewhere that fitted our needs so well. Not only is the Riad conveniently situated next to a kitesurfing school, but it is also right next to the beach. On top of this, a wind-meter on top of the hotel and sea-views made it easy to time our outings to perfection! The staff at the hotel were attentive and accommodating, even going so far as to give us advice on kitesurfing, where the best places to eat were and kit storage. We ate at the hotel, whilst watching an incredible sunset, and the food was impeccable along with the service. If we returned from kitesurfing early enough, a tapas with a free drink for 25 Dirhams was a deal that was too good to miss. A few areas for improvement would be overly-firm beds…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

It is situated less than a 5 minute walk to the beach making it a great hotel to stay at especially if you are there for water sports. There is also a water sports shop at the hotel, where you can hire out kit and have lessons.

 February 2013,4,Nice and clean but nothing special,"Perfect location close to the beach, nice and clean rooms (altough very windy - even with all the doors and windows closed) and really good service. Extra plus for the tortoises by the (cold) pool! Our conclusion was: a good hotel for a good price, but nothing special. We liked the generous breakfast, but the lunch was tasteless and boring.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2013,5,Great place to stay,This is a great place to stay. Easy to get to town and very close to the beach. The staff are excellent and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Rooms are well appointed and the decor is traditional. For what you pay it is well worth it. We would stay here is we come again.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2013,5,Perfect hotel,"What a particularly nice family run this really good little hotel. Not pretentious in any way, just good, clean, comfortable, and excellent value. And an enormous breakfast was included. I asked where I could hire a car and they kindly organized a car to be delivered to hotel which saved a lot of hassle and was good value. The owners were very friendly and the swimming pool is very nice. Two tortoises live in the garden!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2012,5,Couldn't have been better!,My friends and I had a fantastic time at Riad Zahra. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The Riad was beautiful (I've since been inspired to decorate my own place in a similar style) and very reasonably priced. The rooms were lovely. Location was great too. Close to the surfing area and not too far from the Medina. The pool area was picturesque - surrounded by brightly coloured flowers. The turtles and tortoises provided hours of amusement. I would recommend it to anyone and would happily stay there again if I returned to Essaouira.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2012,5,"October 2012, nice & enjoyable","Nice familly stay, where we enjoy the place even as we experienced quite unusable bad weather (raining...). Perfect situation as very close by walking from the beach & kite/winsurfing clubs, enabling the kids to go and come back alone.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2012,5,Fabulous stay,"I stayed at the Riad for a total of four days and was overwhelmed by the hospitality of the owners and staff from the word go. After our welcome to the Riad, we were offered onsite assistance during our stay, which is always reassuring for foreign travellers. The Riad is only a mere 20 minute stroll from the medina and tucked only minutes away from the beach. Breakfast every morning was exceptional (and super generous!), the room was clean and comfortable and the constant attention from the friendly staff was such a pleasant surprise and made our stay truly memorable. The poolside was a welcome retreat from the crazy beachside wind, while the Riad's restaurant offered a fabulous range of fresh, Spanish-inspired food. It's just a shame we weren't there long enough to see the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2012,3,Disappointing,"Found our stay at this Riad to be rather disappointing after staying in wonderful riads in Fez and Marrakech. Foyer area very nice, and the staff were helpful and welcoming. Rooms were dowdy and the shower areas need updating. No flyscreens on the windows, so could not open. Beds extremely hard and uncomfortable. Breakfast was poor and as previously noted lin other reviews eft uncovered. We had dinner in the restaurant upstairs. Two of the meals were extremely poor quality. Reasonable pool area, though can get crowded and insufficient seating around perimeter. Short walk to the beach, Very disappointed with the beach, as it was quite dirty and had a lot of broken glass. Nice walk or cheap taxi ride to town centre. A couple of nice restaurants/cafes on the walk into…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2012,3,"2 mins walk to beach, 20 mins walk to Medina or a very cheap taxi ride.","We have just returned from a week at the Riad Zahra and really enjoyed our stay. The Riad staff are very welcoming, a special mention to Jeffrey, who always had a smile on his face and was eager to please. The food in the upstairs restaurant is amazing, the chef is a great chef with a fab sense of humour. The food in the downstairs restaurant, could've been better. Breakfast was ok but the same thing every day got a bit much, could've done with an option and maybe some fruit. The tables were set up with the food ready for people to come to breakfast and the flies got there before the clientele each time as food was left uncovered. Was a bit unclean too, we ate downstairs one evening and there were still crumbs left on the seats and floor from breakfast. The rooms were very dark…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2012,5,Beautiful Riad,Riad Zahra is a beautiful property and very authentic. We spent 6 nights here. All of the staff were very polite and efficient. The room was very comfortable. We ate in both restaurants and the food was superb. The Riad Zahra is perfect if you are in Essaouira for kite surfing as it is across the road from the main beach (a two minute walk). The Riad provides weather information for those that need the wind for their holiday! It is an enjoyable 20 min stroll from the main town or you can take a taxi for around 80p. Would definitely stay here again.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2012,5,"Fantastic Riad, Fantastic Staff, Fantastic Location","Riad Zahra is a wonderful Riad with a perfect location less than 100m to the beach and a short 15 min walk (or 5 min taxi) into the Medina. Riad Zahra is not only great for singles but couples and families. It has a wonderful welcoming feel and a very friendly atmosphere with staff being able to speak a number of languages. Rooms are large and perfectly adequete for everyone's needs. Great range of food can be bought through out the day not only in the pool side restaurant, but upstairs in their new tapas and grill restaurant. Would recommend this Riad to anyone travelling to Essaouria and can't wait to visit again!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2012,4,A very relaxing stay,"The location of the riad is graet. it is in front of the seaside and not far from the medina (20 minutes by feet, 5 by taxi,car or touristic train) The rooms are clean, and quite big, We had three beds, even if we are a couple. The breakfast is very good and plenty of delicious food : there are the crepes too. There are also two restaurants: one traditional one and a spanish one. We had dinner at the spanish one. It was very good. During the night there is no noise, the temperature is fine. We slept very well. There is also a little swimming pool. and the possibility to rent surf and kite-surf equipment , or to book some surf and kite-surf lessons.( no wind-surf lessons and equipment) The owners are a family of spanish . They are very kind and they speaks italian…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2012,4,Riad Zahra - real nice place and great owners,"Riad Zahra definitely is one of the place you should consider to stay when in Essaouira. Even when it is slightly out of town, the atmosphere is great. The owners are really nice - Spanish/French - and will go out of their way to help you out with tips and advice. The two restaurants are great. We did not try the tapas, but this is available. The pool is superb and the two turtles swimming in there add a spark to it all. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are nice.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2012,2,Such a disappointment...,"Who ever designed the web page for this riad should be shot. It is very decieving. It is not right on the beach and the walk to the madina is probably 20 minutes, plus. The owners are delightful but we had booked through an agent and were expecting twin beds (was travelling with a girlfriend) and as two women we wanted our own beds. It is very dark and didn't look clean. The owners helped us find other accommodation which was much more to our liking as we were a five minute walk to the madina. Shopping in Essaouira far surpassed Marrakesh not only in price but in choice as well. I would definitely go back to Essaouira but wouldn't stay at Riad Zahra.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2012,5,Cant wait to go back,"The Riad Zahra is a wonderfull budget hotel with a great location 30 seconds from the beach and about 15 minutes beachfront walk to the centre of town. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, genuinely felt that everybody wanted you to have the best time possible. Room was cleaned every day and had everything you required to a good standard. Both restaurants served good food for a good price. Going to the upstairs restaurant for a beer and freshly cooked tapas looking out over the beach at the setting sun, after an afternoon on the water was a perfect end to the day! hotel is located right next door to a brilliant kitesurf/watersports school which made it easy for renting equipment and arranging lessons. Staff were equaly as helpfull and also arranged twice weekly client…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2012,2,Reminded us of Benidorm...and not in a good way!,"Essaouira is an absolutely beautiful town I would definitely recommend visiting. But don't stay in the Riad Zahra! It is really far from the medina, at least a 20 min walk, and it would not be safe to walk back to the Riad at night. You see far more by staying in the medina, and have loads of amazing food options (food at the Riad Zahra is questionable).The hotel itself was shabby and dated. The turtles in the pool were the only positive! We also had a GIANT cockroach in our room - lovely! Our room was next to a building site which was really noisy and annoying. The bathroom was really dark and actually quite creepy. It was a strange place to be and reminded us of Benidorm....larger older men in very small swimming trunks sunbathing on the horrendously uncomfortable pool-side…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2012,5,Fantastic Riad!,"Riad Zahra is a fantastic Riad close by the Atlantic Ocean in the laidback surfers town Essaouira. Essaouira is very windy and therefore ideal for windsurfers and kite surfers, but also surfers will enjoy themselves. Next door of the Riad is the surf school where you can arrange your lessons or hire materials. The Riad has an outdoor swimming pool with turtles walking and swimming around! The rooms are not too big, but big enough and have spacious bathrooms. The rooms are clean. The mattress is a bit hard and therefore makes it easier to dream about surfing at night ;) We had lunch once at the restaurant of the Riad and it was not a success but in town there are many good restaurants. It is absolutely worth going to Riad Zahra. Good price – quality ratio.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2012,5,Great place to stay in Essaouira,"My husband and I stayed for three nights in May 2012 and we were really pleased with Riad Zahra. The owners were incredibly welcoming, kind and helpful. When I was feeling unwell, the owners drove me to the pharmacy and accompanied me just in case I had trouble explaining my issue. Nothing was too much trouble and they helped us with reservations at local restaurants. The riad is beautifully decorated and the rooms pleasant. We really enjoyed the location - 10-15 minutes walk from the Medina along the sea front - which meant we had a lovely walk up and down the beach each day. Its a great location for the water sports, horse riding and camel treks. Breakfasts were good. As a bed and breakfast it was great, however for the 'foodie' traveller I would recommend leaving the riad for…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,Perfect location for kiteboarding,"We loved the riad due to its great location near the kiteboarding area of the beach. There is also a kite shop next to the hotel. The owner and owners family were wonderful, very helpful, helping with reservations ar restaurants and spas in town. It's about a 20 minute easy walk to town, or a quick cab ride. The riad has a restaurant on site which is nice especially because it has a bar",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2012,5,Second visit and just as good as before,"This May I returned to Riad Zahra after about three years and fould that it much the same. That is friendly, reasonably priced and clean and tidy. The hotel is at the end of the beach so is a good ten minute walk to the old town. Not a problem as the beach boardwalk is just a block away, no need to walk along a busy road. If you don't fancy the walk say at the end of a day in town the taxi are cheap 5/10 dirham. Since my previous stay there are some beach restaurants added just a couple of minutes walk. These seem reasonably priced and have a good atmosphere, lovely to kick back in front of the open fire beer in hand watching the sun set. The hotel offers dining though it can't be considered a dining destination, just a place to get decent food at a reasonable price. The…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2012,5,Just perfect,"So friendly, clean, delicious food, great pool and the new BBQ terrace will be fantastic with the best view of the beach & sunset. The family & staff go out of their way to look after you- I caught a cold on the journey over and the following day Jofre drove me to the chemist. I picked up the wrong medication and Xavier (the owner) drove me back again! The following morning, Jofre brought me hot milk and honey. My wife and I weren't sure if we paid cash for 1 meal and without question, it was taken off our bill (we hardly had to ask). Also, my wife hurt her back after a small quad biking accident. The first mention of this at the Riad and Xavier had Tiger Balm ready and recommendations for good massages. The Riad know all the best companies to book for horse riding, quad biking,…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2012,4,"Helpful staff, great pool.","We stayed 6 nights in june and enjoyed our stay. Not the most luxurious riad but spacious room with very helpful staff and very good value for money. It was incredibly windy whilst we were there and the pool although enclosed offered no shelter from it, to the extent that when a 4 year old child was stood on the edge, a particularly strong gust blew him in!! Take a warm top as it was unexpectedly cold at night. turtles in pool was quite novel. 20 minute walk alongside the beach into the medina was quite pleasant or a 10drm taxi ride(about 80p). Very clean.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2012,5,Brilliant place to stay!,"Only stayed two nights, but were overwhelmed by the kindness of staff. Location is 2 minutes from the beach and the 0,60 eur taxis drive u to the medina quickly unless you want a nice 15mins walk at the beach. Breakfast is includes and delicious. They also serve lunch and dinner - without pre-bookins. Great big pool and sun'bathing in the garden - and the best - ther are 2 little turtels swimming with you :-)",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,"Welcoming, clean and comfortable Riad","The owners and staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. They mostly spoke good English and fluent French. We didn't think we'd eat much at the hotel but the food ended up being good, generous and reasonable and the eating area comfortable and relaxing. There are resident turtles in the pool and tortoises in the bushes. We went at the end of April and it was very windy -- it was OK by the pool if you lay down! The beach is beautiful and huge -- we had an amazing day on the dunes on a less windy day. Definitely try the avocado milkshake in town.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2012,4,Friendly place with a lovely pool,"We booked Riad Zahra as we were looking for somewhere with a pool. We found all of the staff here genuinely friendly and helpful. It felt like a very relaxed place with all sorts of visitors from couples, to families and groups there for the water sports. It is about 20 mins walk into the medina, but we quite liked the walk and enjoyed being close to the beach. The Riad was very clean and we had a big room with an amazing sea view (room 35). The pool area was good with plenty of seating, although at times it was pretty windy and chilly. The breakfast was tasty and there was plenty of it!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2011,5,friendly coastal Riad,"Stayed at this Riad in sept/oct 2011 for 4 nights. Lovely welcoming people. I thought I had booked a room with Balcony, but no, the owner apologised and said to book direct on the web site next time, to ensure I get the room I want. Same price. It is very popular and caters for all groups of people. Nice room, very clean, shortage of wardrobe space, but ok , I managed. I had packed a few dresses for nightlife in Marrakesh for the end of holiday. I think it's best for a traveller without to much baggage. The breakfast served either on the terrace or dining area. Possible to have it at the pool as well as in your room [extra ie: room service] was good, nice choice etc The pool is lovely, secluded and only a few yards from the beach. We went up on to the sun terrace ,[…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,"Fabulous stay! Friendly, welcoming and relaxing.","Riad Zahra is situated outside the Medina close to the beach, and prior to checking in here we had been staying in the medina and wanted to stay somewhere a little more relaxing. The Spanish hosts couldn't be more hospitable and have an eye for their guests needs. The pool area is fabulous with the swimming turtles stealing the show. The Riad courtyard is beautifully decorated and the rooms are comfortable and roomy. We found the bar and food was very reasonably priced, and the breakfast was delicious. With the beach only a few minutes walk away our 4 nights spent here were a perfect end to our two week stay in Morocco.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2012,4,Very nice to bring children,"Nice place to bring the kids. Calm, relaxing and very nice and helpfull staff. Not far from the beach.Big rooms where the whole family could sleep. Nice food. Nice and friendly place.. Note: The beds are a little bit hard, and the tv is small and not so good. The kids loved a camel ride on the beach. It cost about 120 MAD per person. ( Do it the first day and the camel owners will leave you alone after that..)",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2012,5,fantastic relaxed Riad,"we felt welcome from the moment we arrived. The relaxed atmosphere was perfect for a holiday with kids as we never felt that they were being a nuisance to anyone, in fact the opposite. Everyone was so friendly. Our room could sleep the whole family which was great and being next to reception meant they was always someone on guard whilst they slept and we stayed in the bar area to relax of an evening. It was a very cold room, but when we mentioned this we immediately were given an electric heater that worked a treat, with huge apologies. The only downside was the freezing cold pool, but it was to be expected at the time of year we visited really. We did look into the atlas hotel to use the pool but there too it was unheated. however the addition of turtles in the pool cheered…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2012,4,Cosy hotel,"Cosy hotel in the outskirts of town 15 min walk to medinaen. Good restaurants nearby. Menarat far away will not disturb your sleep.

Note: hard beds.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2012,5,Xavier and his team are awesome hosts,"I am just back from 6 nights staying a this riad and can't recommend it enough. It started with the manager, Xavier, greeting us late on arrival with an offer of tea, coffee etc. This set the standard of friendly faces for the remainder of the stay. We even found a heater placed in our room before we had to ask as the temperature had dropped the previous day. Breakfasts were great and the juice to die for. The pool area is adorned with friendly turtles who wonder about and even go for a swim. If there's only one thing that stood out as a bit of feedback it's that the beds are a touch hard. But by the end we were used to that also. I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially kite surfers as the Kite-surfing Morocco shop is next door, the waves are in front and other…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 February 2011,5,Essence of Morocco,"This Hotel is highly recommendable. I was there for 4 days by myself to enjoy some optimal relaxation. And I must say, Riad Zahra is the right place. It's not located near alle the other hotels nor directly at the beach, but that doesn't make it a bad thing at all. It only takes 2 minuttes to get to the beach by foot. Because of it's location it's incredibly quiet at the terrace and the pool. There's absolutely no traffic noise at all, which makes the pool even more enjoyable. The pool is great and the sun is alwys shining on the terrace. This amazing hotel also has a Restaurant.

 September 2011,5,Great place to stay in Essaouria,"Riad Zahra is a great choice because you get all the style of the Moroccan riad but without the noise/privacy problems that you might encounter in some smaller establishments. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love the feel of a traditional riad, but this usually comes with added ‘bonuses’ such as knowing when your neighbours are taking a shower and being woken in the morning by sounds from the riad kitchen. Rest assured, the walls of Riad Zahra are of solid construction and coupled with the sea air you’re guaranteed a goods nights sleep! You won’t miss out on Moroccan style if you stay here; all rooms and common areas are done out in a very tasteful unfussy way.

 November 2011,5,Very good value for money in Essaouira,"Wonderful riad that has everything: great location (especially if you want to surf etc.) close to the beach, great atmosphere, very helpful owners, nice swimming pool and good breakfast. The beds were a bit too hard though.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2011,5,Nice little beachfront hotel!,We have stayed in Riad Zahra for almost a week and enjoyed every day of it. The whole building is really beautiful as are the pool and the rooms.

But also their staff try their best in making you have a terrific stay.

One point to note - the beds were a little small, but the owners did everything possible to make your stay great, and have made the hotel fresh and ready for guests... as it's very clean and freshly painted, with sizeable rooms and lots of plants and decor. The swimming pool was great, very clean and even had turtles swimming around in it, what a novelty!! But it did lack ambience and atmosphere... perhaps some music would make a difference......

Xavier and all the staff were wonderful, they made time to mingle with the guests and they were definitely a hit with our 19month old! Tapas hour was a great time to chat with other guests before heading into town for a meal. The turtles and tortoises kept the girls entertained all week - the poor turtles even got a ride round the pool in a pink dinghy! The only drawback would be the unheated pool, but once the initial shock wore off it was nice and refreshing. We had a wonderful meal at Tatiana Restaurant and enjoyed shopping in the Souks which was far less pressured than Marrakesh. I would definitely come back, 6 days just didn't seem long enough.

The walk to the town takes about 15-20 minutes and it is windy at night, but taxis are less than a pound each way and we felt it was better to stay a little walk away from all the noise and hustle and bustle.

The rooms were very comfortable and clean, book early because it is a very popular hotel. Our boys loved the pool and were fascinated by the many tortoises around the grounds.

The place is very clean and well-kept, and the staff are very lovely and attentive, and equally comfortable speaking English and French. The decor in the rooms and around the hotel is beautiful, with lots of interesting art and artefacts on the walls. We never expected travelling abroad with our 3-year-old son to be so relaxing, and the fact that it was is in large part a measure of what a nice place this hotel is - the staff were happy to play with him, and we felt someone was always keeping an eye on him if he went wandering!

The walk to and from town is very pleasant, and taxis are cheap. This Riad is beautifully decorated and spotless. The staff were always willing to help with a smile, and Xavier even organised a meeting for me with Ranch de Diabat, the local equestrian centre.

I would recommend this Riad to anyone travelling to Essaouira and I will definately be back!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2011,4,Pleasant stay,"We stayed here for 4 nights back in April. Due to bad weather in the mountains we phoned to see if we could come 1 day earlier than planned and they managed to fit us in. We originally had a room on the ground floor, but the helpful staff moved us to a better room on the top floor after the first night. The bar area and restaurant are very nice and we enjoyed the tapas at happy hour which was particularly good value for a beer and a tapas dish. Breakfasts were lovely and we got proper crepes every day. The weather while we were staying in Essaouira was awful - relentless rain and flooded roads so it was nice to be indoors in such a lovely, comfortable place.

 July 2011,4,"Great staff, 1 block from the beach","While our family loved the Essaouira medina, we found the beach to be so windy and cold -- even in July -- that we couldn't spend time on it. So we wish we'd chosen a riad in the medina rather than a hotel near the beach. However, at Zahra the staff was lovely and the public spaces were nice and staffed with excellent folks. They seemed to have a lot of happy customers. The pool was too cold to swim, so the owner gave our driver directions to another hotel he owns about 15 mins away with a much warmer pool and nicer environs -- he let us and other families staying at Zahra spend the afternoon at that pool, which was great for all our kids. There is a beach just beyond that hotel (south of Essaouria) that's protected from the wind and we spent hours happily there, as well. …",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

The place itself is beautiful on the inside, with trees, plants and paintings galore, as well as a lovely grand staircase. The breakfasts were OK (we found that breakfast in Morocco was rarely impressive) and served gracefully, but tapas hour is to be avoided. The pool was of an excellent size, if not completely freezing, but they provide an indoor shower next to it as well as plenty of sunbeds. To our surprise and delight, we found the pool area populated with a significant number of turtles, who spent the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2011,5,Stay at the Riad Zahra Mogador!!!,"As soon as we arrived we were greeted with a warm welcome by all staff members who were friendly and most helpful throughout our entire stay. The hotel is decorated beautiful with its bright and airy reception and lounge area, atmospheric restaurant/ bar and charming pool area, which was crawling with the hotel’s very own family of tortoises. Our bedroom was located on the side of the hotel but we did have a view of the beach. The room itself was lovely and had a bit of traditional Moroccan charm, but most importantly it was clean. There's no air conditioning in the room, but as Essaouira is also known as the windy, sleeping at night was not uncomfortable at all as there was constantly a cool breeze coming through (well in June anyway). Just a little tip for all those sun…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2011,5,Fantastic place,"We had a wonderful time at the RIad. It's a beautiful building, very well located and utterly tranquil. Every single member of staff was welcoming and extremely helpful. Lovely pool and balcony. The restaurant also served up some great food: excellent value all-round. I'd thoroughly recommend staying here and hope to be back in the near future.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2011,5,Great value and exceptionally helpful staff,"Perfect place to stay if you are here for the beach sports. A simple, yet well equipped hotel with a pool and separate raised sun terrace; on 2nd floor - perfect for catching those evening rays, out of the wind! Less than 5 min from the water sports centres and main beach cafe/bars, but 1.5km from the medina. Very comfortable rooms with excellent views, ensuite w shower, loo and tv (w English channels).  No AC, but not necessary here, due to stable temperature. WIFI throughout and a free Internet terminal at the front desk. Simple but well presented breakfast of yoghurt, breads, crepes, jams, OJ and tea/coffee.  Extremely helpful and welcoming staff, this is what really makes this place stand out. Well priced and I will definitely be back!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2011,4,Very mellow hotel outside the medina with great personal owner service,"If you want a small hotel (23rooms) with great personal service, right on the beach near the main sea sports centres for surf, widsurf and kitesurf (and camels, quads...), and importantly a pool out of the wind; but don't mind a short 25min walk (or cheap petit taxi back at 7 drhms) to the mellow medina - this is a great base. We had a great 10 days but there were also groups dropping in and out more quickly who also seemed very happy. We'd go back with no hesitation.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2011,5,I would advise anyone to stay at this lovely riad,"me and my partner stayed at the riad zahara in May 2011 and we are so pleased that we chose it. It felt like a home from home and the staff did all they could to make us feel welcome. The food - in particular the tapas happy hour was great value for money and the breakfast was generous! the riad has a lovely pool with two friendly resident turtles!! The decor is cosy and authentic and the reception area is quite exceptional. it is a perfect location for the beach, medina and port. I would like to thank the lady who booked us the riad eva in Marrakesh for our onward journey - we were not disappointed, thank you! Liz & Parit",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2011,5,An excellent family friendly hotel,"We had a wonderful 4 night stay in this hotel. It was just by a clean beach where you could walk for miles. The Medina wasa lovely walk ( 20mins) along the coast. The staff were helpful, friendly and the hotel was spotlessly clean.The breakfast was delicious and evening food also very good. We had 6 and 8 year old children who loved the pool and turtles. Would highly recommend and we hope to go back.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2011,5,Loved it!,"Stayed here for a week in March, absolutely loved it. Very relaxing, nice food, nice and clean rooms, will def return. The people that run this place are probably the friendliest i have ever met!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2011,4,Great,"Thoroughly recommend it. The staff are really friendly and helpful. The food is great, both breakfast and dinner. I swam in the pool which was too cold really but I got to share my swim with the two tortoises. Very laid back but always helpfulif you need it. downsides: very hard bed, and we had to steel ourselves sometimes to walk into town for dinner, good 15 to 20 minutes. But really, the place outweighs both of these, I would come again and would recommend it. Lovely to be away from the bustle of the medina and on a quieter side of the beach.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 March 2011,4,Loved Essaouira & Riad Zahra,"We have just returned from a 2 week holiday in Morocco - stayed 6 nights in Riad Zahra and we can recommend it. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, most with great english. They were super with our 3 year old boy - this was his favourite hotel in Morocco (mainly due to the 2 turtles that live in the swimming pool! - a real hit with him). The hotel is very clean, with modern Moroccan styling - not really a Riad though (more a characterful hotel). It is very light and spacious, large rooms with comfy beds and fab powerful shower. We had room 16, great view of the beach and camels. We organised our stay via Naturally Morocco and can recommend them highly too.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2011,5,Excellent hospitality!,"We stayed for just two nights in Riad Zahra, but I regret that we decided to move to Marrakech. The rooms are nice and clean, good value for your money, really close to the beach and windsurfcenters and the staff is really helpfull! For example: I forgot my phone in the hotelroom and found that out when I was back in Holland. Just one call and some emails later my phone was delivered at home by Fedex within some days! Very kind! Just go there!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2011,5,good accommodation,"good riad , nice stuff ,the swim pool is very good , but too cold to swim , essaouira was our last city we visited , we stayed 2 nights and than we left Morocco ,essaouira and riad zahra are recommended",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2010,4,A very friendly hotel in an excellent locaion,"Excellent location just opposite the beach. Very friendly welcome and friendly service throughout our stay. The swimming pool was very clean and well maintained, with the odd bonus of tortoises around and occasionally swimming in it! Breakfast was good and lunch by the pool also good - we didn't eat there in the evenings so can't coment on these. A 15-20 minute stroll along the promenade to the old town which has a good selection of very good restaurants. Restaurant Sirocco (www.le-sirocco.com) was excellent. The only negative was the bed - very hard and not comfortable.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,"Comfy, fun, stylish, and near the beach","We were really impressed with this place. Extremely friendly and helpful staff (some of whom speak impeccable English!). Clean, spacious room with a lot of local flavor. Comfy bed. Comfy and fun lounge areas on the first floor. A lot of variety on the menu if you opt to stay in for dinner. The price was a bit of a splurge for us as budget travelers, but it seemed reasonable for how nice the place felt (especially compared to other places with similar amenities). It's located in a nice residential area, just a couple blocks from the beach.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2010,3,Great stay within the budget,"A comfortable, but less charming, riad in this coastal village. The staff could have been more accommodating, but they were not always around. We never got a warm feeling being in this riad. The breakfast was extremely disappointing: bread, jam, honey, and coffee. Our second morning we were able to order more, but only after we inquired about ordering omelets. The only thing that saved our visit was the fact that for 5 of us for 2 nights, the bill was well within our budget.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2010,5,Excellent Place. Perfect for families with children and close to the beach and in walking distance of the medina,"We loved our stay at Riad Zahra. Like an other review mentioned, an excellent compromise between a traditional Riad and cosy hotel adapted to children visitors (swimming pool, easy access by car and to the beach). Very friendly and helpful staff and owners. Good food in the restaurant, beautiful interior decoration, nice swimming pool and terrace. Even with small kids walking to the medina was still possible and the beach is just around the corner. New Year's night was very nice and well-organised.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2010,5,Cozy Hotel,"The hotel is charming, and the personal extremly nice, helpful and engaged. You feel allmost at home and this feeling can you never have in a big hotel. The beds are hard but it was good for my back. The breakfast can be better. After 7 days you feel tired of all bagettes and croisant!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2010,4,If you want a compromise between traditional riad and large hotel,"...this could be perfect. We stayed here for 6 nights and really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere, excellent service and in particular the pool. There is a family of tortoises (turtles?) in the garden which was probably the highlight of our daughters' entire trip to Morocco! The owners are French and Moroccan and couldn't be more helpful. The food we had was unremarkable but they serve alcohol and the atmosphere in the bar/restaurant area is very relaxed. The medina is 20 minutes' walk away or a cheap taxi ride. Essaouira is great but the beach is for playing (kite surfing etc) rather than sunbathing and the sea is very cold. If you're travelling with children then I'd definitely recommend finding accommodation with a pool. This hotel fitted the bill perfectly and I'd…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2010,3,Average at best,"We have just returned from our stay at Riad Zahra and would say it is average at best. Having read all the reviews I have to admit I was expecting to be wowed with a charming riad set in a great location; this just wasn't the case. The Riad is 'ok' on first look, this got steadily worse when we were shown to our room which was small and very basic complete with literally the hardest bed in the world...oh and cockroaches, lovely. There are redeeming features such as the pool and the obliging staff but I did have a constant unease that the place just wasn't clean. I wouldn't say don't go (unless of course you have back problems as you just wont survive the bed) but I wouldn't recommend it either.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,You MUST stay here,"Absolutely lovely, the photos and reviews are very true. Unfortunately we only stayed for one night - should have done at least two.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2010,5,"traditional gorgeous Riad, with lovely pool and great location","Lovely rooms and central Riad area is stunning. Staff are lovely and very helpful, spoke fantastic English and French. Hennin (sp?) was lovely and friendly. Staff called the other hotel and helped us cancel and gave us a room for the last two nights...true stars who made our week fabulous. Lovely big pool and sunbeds, turtles and tortoises wandering around and swimming in the pool. Hotel balcony faces the sea which is just over the quiet road which is gorgeous for a sunset. Which are also stunning setting over the island out to sea. Beach is 30 seconds away for walks, etc and Essaouira town is just 15 minute walk along the beach, the walk is safe and fine. Suggestions as always is to respect culture by wearing long sleeves and trousers while out in town, this will save you from…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2010,5,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff and close to the city - Stay here!","Normally I don't write reviews but i've taken the time to give this hotel the praise it deserves. We looked through loads of hotels when trying to decide where to stay in Morocco and finally settled on Riad Zahra because of the good reviews. Here's my feedback from our stay Hotel Beautiful traditional hotel with gorgeous rooms and a real Morcan feel. The lounge/bar area is really inviting and relaxing and you could quite easily hang out there for a night - we did. The pool is very relaxing and there are loungers to hang out on. There's two tortoises who hang out there all day which makes for a good picture. There's also a roof terrace where you can sit and have a drink and what the sun go down. No prolems with hot water and the rooms are made over each day, if you…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2010,5,Perfect hotel in a perfect place,"We were looking for somewhere to relax after the hustle of Fes and found exactly what we we wanted in Essaouira. The city itself is beautiful; good shopping, nice restaurants and a lovely beachfront. It is as windy as everyone says which is why the hotel, with it's great pool and sheltered sun terrace area, was so perfect. Aside from the pleasure of having turtles pottering around as you lay in the sun (ignore the muppet who questioned the hygiene implications?!), the staff were very attentive with good food and drinks served all day. The room was fine - nothing special but exactly what we needed while the interior of the hotel itself was very nice - much better than the first impression you see from the beach. We did a surf lesson with the adjoining surf school which wasn't…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2010,5,"Shhh, I'd rather not tell.......","Sometimes you come accross a place that you don't want tell tell people about because its just too good and you want to keep it a secret. When we left, we were seen to our taxi by the owners - as we pulled away I said to my partner ""I don't treat my friends and relatives as well as they do"" and I meant it. Yes, the tv was small and a mile away as the room was so large, and yes there were only two chanels - but who cares! The views of the beach, the tortoises, the pool, the bar, the food, the stroll to the medina, the walk to the island....................All this and the fun, good tempered bargaining in the shops. This is THE place to chill out and be looked after.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2010,5,Beautiful Riad with Wonderful Hospitality,"What a fantastic find !! Once you've been to this Riad you will never want to do a 'typical' hotel stay again. It was beautifully decorated in the communal areas aswell as the rooms. We have a triple room with large bathroom and 2 balconies which was plentiful. We had the misfortune of rain/thunder on our first night so we ate at the Riad. The food was delicious but if we had stayed for more than 4 nights I'm sure we would have run out of choice as the menu was only limited. The local beer namely flag is very nice if a little pricey at 35DH (local bar on right hand side next to petrol station as you walk into Essaouira - Bar Mogador I think sells for 18DH). The owners of the Riad were always on hand for advice and the waiting staff, pool attendant & cleaners were always…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2010,4,Loved the turtles!,"Very pretty welcoming hotel, full of plants and colour. Sea view rooms are a good size with an excellent view of the pool and beach. it's a bit of a hike to the town, but a pleasant promenade walk. Very good pool with resident turtles, plus tortoises in the grounds. Worth having the pool as the beach was too windy to sit or swim! Lots of places to sit, wi fi in the foyer, traditional furnishings, poolside bar/terrace. Breakfasts are good. The only downside is the quality of the food on the snack menu (we did not try the set evening meal as no veggie option and due to poorish quality of the other food). There are loads of places to eat in Essaouira so don't let this put you off! Overall very good value and a pleasant stay",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2010,5,Delightful hotel,"Our daughter has been working nearby Riad Zahra for a few months and booked us in when we visited her this July. What a shame it is off the main street, the place has a wonderful entrance and just got better as we walked around. The welcome was very friendly, our room on the top floor very spacious. we loved the Moroccan feel, not over the top, just right. We slept very well after our long journey from Marrakesh by bus. the bathroom is ok for size with everything tiled in mosaics. Generous sized shower, wash basin and loo. Two very large towels each, plus soap and shampoo. T.v bit boring only local programs and my French is rubbish! In the morning for breakfast there is a choice of where to sit, in the dinning room, only about 6 tables with the seating around the wall on…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 January 2010,3,Nice accomodation but not for those seeking authentic riad experience,"The acomodation was clean and spacious. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was tasty and filling. The pool area was beautiful and the views of the sea superb. however, this is a hotel, as opposed to a riad. It is also a 20 minute walk from the medina. I would not recommend this hotel if you're looking for the riad experience, but it is a reasonably priced hotel if you do not want to be within the medina.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2009,4,Friendly family hotel,Real find. More famliy hotel than riad. Stayed for 5 nights. Friendliest staff who made us feel at home and took marvelous care of our young daughter. Walking distance to the beach. Beautifull pool area.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2009,3,Not a Riad but a comfortable and clean hotel with pool,A smallish hotel which lacks the charm and character of a true Riad and frankly could be a hotel in any coastal resort on the Eurpean or African coast. The food was good and the service generally ok. If you want a pleasant affordable base in easy reach of both the beach and Essaouirra town then this is perfectly good enough. With the added bonus of a decent swimming pool.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2009,3,"Not bad, but REALLY not great","Riad Zara: Very friendly staff and a GREAT pool provided a nice and welcome oasis from Essoueira's heat, wind and Medina. The food in the restaurant was amongst the weakest on our holiday - that's not to say bad, just REALLY nothing special at all! The room was a bit of a let down, and the weakest part of the whole experience. It was absolutely clean, but the decor is drab, the facilities nothing special and the overall experience entirely unremarkable. I wouldn't go back, or reccomend it, but neither would I actively disocurage you from going. It's just nothing special, and you could therefore have a more memorable experience elsewhere. We stayed here because of the pool, but on second thought, we should have been in the Medina - where all the action and character that…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2009,4,Very good Riad in the windy coastal town of Essaouria,"We stayed at Riad Zahra for 9 nights in August. My wife and I had an upstairs room; our two teenage kids down stairs. The Riad is very clean and the rooms are spacious. Our kids room was a little on the dark side, but ours was bright. The breakfast was yummy: fresh bread, pancakes, freshly squeezed orange juice, croissants. We had lunch at the hotel most days: the choice was good and the food excellent. All of the staff at the Riad, including the two very kind and welcoming owners, were wonderful. The pool is a good size, but it isn't heated ! Right next door to the Riad is a surf school run by some young Moroccan folk: they were really helpful and the surfing course my son went on was good. They also arranged some horse riding for us which was just wonderful: we were…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2009,5,"Great hotel, good value for money - lovely experience","What a great hotel, with really genuinely friendly (and multi-lingual) staff. Great rooms with were well maintained and cleaned. Breakfast was very tasty - croissants, crepes, fresh orange juice and tea, coffee, hot choc or mint tea. MMMMM Nice (though unheated) outdoor pool - complete with turtles and fantastic sun-trap roof terrace overlooking the sea! Wonderful place. and just across from the club mistral centre/wave area of the beach. about 15 mins walk from the medina.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2009,5,"great atmosphere, friendly people, super breakfast, free parking in front of hotel.","With our four children (8,11,13) we made a roundtrip through Maroc. We stayed at 7 great hotels/riads and Riad Zahra had the best atmosphere. It's a very nice place to stay becouse of the location, the people and the cosyness of the riad. The rooms are very simple but clean. The breakfast is good and the service is great. Also for people who like to surf they have a surfschool and its only 50 mtrs from the beach. To go into the medina you walk 10 minutes or go 2 minutes by car. You can leave your car in front of the hotel. They also have a nice and clean pool.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2009,4,Perfect place for family coming by car,"This hotel is in a villa outside the city walls. It is very easy to find and there is parking right in front of the house on a quiet street. The rooms are clean and very simple - kind of like a youth hostel - decorated with traditional items. No frills. Scandinavians would like it! The owner is on site and very friendly. Breakfast is wonderful and the service is quick. The benefit of being outside the city wall is that it is easy to find and you don't have to leave your car outside the city walls and drag your suitcases through the small streets in the medina. The disadvantage is that you will have to drive or walk to the medina in order to see the city and the famous views. And for kids, there is a nice pool.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2009,2,"Relaxing and friendly, great value. Perfect place to chill out","We'd had a bad journey, arriving very tired only to find the online booking agency had mucked up. What could have been pretty disastrous was turned into a great success thanks to the efforts and kindness of the owners and staff. We stayed 5 days and returned for 2 after a week in the ante-Atlas. Spotless hotel (so who worries about a few ants ? You're in Africa ! They're nature's cleaners !), good food, attractive restautant & terrace, delightful pool (and tortoises), Helpful, friendly staff. Easy access to Medina by foot or (v cheap) taxis. We were moved from pretty basic room to one far better as soon as possible. Double beds are a touch hard and small: suggest take a 2 bed room for far more comfort !",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2009,1,Awful place to stay - avoid at all cost or buy yourself a tent!,"I must admit that reading the reviews, I must be on a different planet. But I have to say our time at Riad Zarha was terrible. I would not recommend staying here under any circumstances...basically buy a tent! The rooms were shoddy, staff were unpleasent, the location is miles away from the medina. For once we were fooled by all the seemingly good ratings on expedia and tripadvisor only to be thoroughly disapointed. We stayed in (more costly) Marrakech for half the money Riad Zarha charged us. So I was surprised that Riad Zaraha failed on so many counts. There were ants in our room, and they even failed to provide a fan (let alone AC). For £70/night in Essouria you'd expect that at the very least. To describe the beds is quite hard (pardon the pun) but they seemed to…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2009,5,Perfect place to stay in Essaouira,"We came with the intention of staying one night and ended up staying for the remainder of our Morocco trip. We were enchanted by the charm of Essaouira and found refuge in Riad Zahra after the intensity of Marrakech. Some may prefer to stay in the center and closer to the medina but for us the location of Riad Zahra was perfect and the 15 minute walk along the beach was relaxing. The staff was amazing. Everyone was kind, welcoming, and extremely helpful. The Riad itself was beautiful, clean, comfortable, with nice views, and some really great artwork. We will definitely be back.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2009,4,Great value- especially if you want a pool,"This Riad is really lovely. However, it is a bit of a schlep from the main medina which is a nice enough walk but it is about 15 minutes and if you're only there for a night you might prefer somewhere closer to the action. It's super though to have a pool for longer stays because the beach isn't too nice. The rooms are comfortable but pretty basic, although for £45 a night you can't complain- Morocco isn't any where near as cheap as you would expect.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2009,4,Good value,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Riad Zahra. The hotel was quiet, relaxing with very friendly staff, as we came to expect from other places in Morocco. The room was huge, but quite plainly decorated and furnished - decent standards for a 3* hotel. Everything was clean and there was a good power shower. The breakfasts were good, although we weren't that impressed by lunch or evening meals and would recommend people venture further afield. Ocean Vagabond is a nice cafe bar about 100 metres away from the Zhara which attracts all the kitesurfers and where we spent a great afternoon reading. Elizir in the medina is one of the best restaurants I have been to in a while and not ridiculously expensive. And you can pick up a great lunch at the outdoor fish stalls by the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2009,4,"Great hotel, you won't be disappointed","My wife and I recently returned from an 11 day trip in Morocco. We stayed exclusively in riads.

I am rating this based on the fact that this is a budget, but very good, hotel. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This This is a great hotel- clean, well run, etc. We had a balcony with a view of the ocean which was across the street. The staff was very friendly, the owner literally carried my luggage up. Recommended.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2009,5,Nice Riad in a safe area,"We have been locking for a Riad outside the Medina with a parking for our car, in order not to have to carry our luggage too far and based on reviews here booked the Riad Zahra. Reception staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a nice sea-view room, large and with a nice bathroom. It was so windy that the hotel sign on the roof made noise, but we slept well. Breakfast was very good as well. The Riad is a nice walk from the Medina along the beach. We had dinner in the restaurant Le Coquillage at the entrance to the port and enjoyed the very good prepared seafood very much, but also the menu and the restaurant at the Riad looked nice. We recommend the riad as well as the restaurant Le Coquillage.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2009,5,Great Ryad in the wind town,"We have recently spent 3 nights in the Riad and felt really comfortable and welcomed. The couple who own the Riad are very friendly and helpful. They and other members of the hotel speak different languages (French, Arabic, English, Spanish, Catalán). The Swimming pool is super clean and great to do some laps. There are families with children but we thought they were very well behaved and nice. When the wind blows in the beach, it is a great way to sunbath, chill out and relax. There are a couple of turtles who swim and walk in the pool. The rooms are spacious and clean, some of them with great views to the ocean. We had dinner one night and on arrival and the food was very good + the portions quite generous. Breakfast is based on jams, honey, orange juice, local bread…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 May 2009,3,Too expensive for what it is,"We stayed in Riad Zahra for two nights in May. For 800 dirham we got a small room with a view of the building next door. There were ants in the room, the toilet door didn't close properly, and the walk to the medina is quite far (20-25 minutes in that heat and wind). No air con or fan. It was all pretty ok, but I wasn't overly impressed. The pool is nice, the staff was very helpful. During our stay the hotel was overrun with Dutch families, for some reason. Because of that it wasn't necessarily very quiet or romantic. If I were to go back to Essaouira I would try somewhere closer to/in the medina.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2009,4,Good times at Riad Zhara!,"I’ve spent 5 nights in Riad Zhara in april 2009. It is a nicely decorated riad. The staff is very friendly and helpful, there is a nice restaurant annex bar downstairs with excellent food. Breakfast is ok. There is also a big pool, but unheated so the water is rather cold. The rooms above the kitchen and restaurant (on the left side if you face the ocean) are rather noisy. We have slept 4 nights in room 14 (right side). This room looks rather plain, but is very quiet. I have also slept one night in room 20 above the kitchen. This is a very nice and spacious room with balcony, but there is also a lot of noise. So take earplugs with you if you intend on sleeping there. The location of the hotel is fine. It is a nice walk along the boulevard or the beach that takes about 15…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira

 December 2008,5,What an oasis near the beach,"We arrived at Riad Zahra to a great welcome. Having never stayed in a Riad before, we weren't quite sure what to expect. The tiling, the entrance and the different artifacts throughout the Riad were lovely. My poor fiance was sick with the flu and they brought up a meal to the room for him. It was too cold to use the pool at Christmas but we did have great weather. Our balcony caught a glimpse of the sea. The room was large and I loved the bathroom, it had a good shower. The staff were all lovely. We should have stayed longer in Essaouira and less in Marrakesh. Thanks guys for a lovely stay.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 February 2009,4,"Beautiful, friendly, great food, excellent atmosphere!","We had a perfect stay at Riad Zahra. It's located near the beautiful beach. It's a 15 minutes walk along the seaside to the harbour. The people of Riad Zahra are very very friendly, it feels like home. There is a nice swimming pool (a bit cold in february though) and the bar/restaurant is great. We had very good meals there (try the pastilla, it's lovely). The interior of the hotel is beautiful and colorful. It's a great place to stay when you don't like the standard hotels and are looking for something special.

Essaoira was probably our highlight and the staff at the Riad Zahra played a big part in making our stay as comfortable as it was. The staff was accomodating and had everything we needed. The food and drink was good and our kids loved dipping into the pool even in December. The breakfast included in the price was delicious and got us off to a great start each day. The Riad is close to all other accomodations including a very short walking distance to the beach and Medina. If you stay in Essouira be sure to book at the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2008,5,A truly Palatial Riad!,"Arrived to Essoaira to get away from Marrakech - found the Zahra to be a wonderfully relaxing place, friendly and helpful staff, very chilled out restaurant with a lovely ambience about it. Lovely big pool - although we didnt get to use it as it was a tad windy and we didn not want to disturb the resident turtles. Place is literally on the beach and you can either take the right and go to Essoaira or the left and go Camel or pony trekking. Also lots of Kite surfing. Yeah the beds are hard - but so is every other bed in Morocco it seems and think how much better it is for your back! Recommend that you pay the extra few euros and get a room with a balcony (700MAD) - great big rooms with sofas. would definitely return to this Riad.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2008,4,"Great atmosphere, but be prepared for hard beds!","First impressions of the Riad Zahra were exactly as the reviews suggested, a beautiful friendly Riad, with pretty, simple rooms and wonderful staff. Of the 3 places we stayed in Essaouira, this was our favourite, however, not sleeping due to hard beds and mosquitoes took it's toll and we left after a few nights. We did notice that all beds in Essaouira are hard, even in the 5 star hotels, although these were less hard than those in Riad Zahra. Such a pity as I think this Riad is wonderful and the owners deserve the excellent reviews in tripadvisor. Good points: atmosphere, staff, moroccan style, wi-fi in rooms, pool area, location Bad points: hard beds and slightly dull breakfast",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 July 2008,5,Perfect!,"Just returned from our trip to Morocco and we absolutely loved this Riad. The staff were so friendly and helpful, especially the young girl who works at the front desk. It is about a 10 DH taxi ride from the bus station and a 10-15 minute walk from the Medina, but the beachside walk was much welcomed after large meals in the Medina. The room was cute with a nice bathroom and large window to let the breeze in. Our TV didn't work that well, but it didn't bother us at all. I would definitely recommend this property to those visiting Ess.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2008,5,Gorgeous!,"What a lovely place! The rooms are spotless-very nicely decorated and lovely bathroom. The breakfast was great and they do lunch and dinner there which are also very nice. The pool is lovely and theres lots of little tortoises walking round the edge in the flowerbeds. The owners were lovely and nothing was too much trouble for them. For the price, i dont think you could ask for more in Essaouira!",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2008,5,"Friendly, relaxing and efficient","I've just spent a great week at Riad Zahra. The staff were all extremely welcoming, always helpful and friendly and the service was prompt and efficient. The Riad is decorated in an understated and authentic way, though I believe it's owned by Spanish people. I enjoyed the 15 minute walk along the beach to the medina several times a day to watch the fishermen bring in their catch, to explorte the souks, to visit a hammam, to walk on teh ramparts and watch the waves crashing over the rocks etc. The Moroccan people were very easy-going and friendly and I was happy to walk back alone in the dark in the evenings - though I could perfectly well have taken a petit taxi. I'll definitely go back.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2008,4,Park your kids here!,"After a long journey to get there, the welcome was warm and supportive. It is a pleasant and relaxing space to be in - and it's a shame that modern hotel buildings in the UK cannot incorporate traditional features so gracefully (or, indeed, at all). Without exception, the staff were helpful and kind, sorting out an annoying problem with the shower before I could even roll my eyes and quip about Moroccan plumbers; they kept our finicky-eating 5 year old's tummy full. The set menu was fresh and tasty, despite the limited choice - but we found the choice off the main restaurant menu limited and unappetising. But on our last day we had the tapas - hardly what you'd get in old Cordoba, but inexpensive and good for a poolside lunch. The family of tortoises in the garden, and the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 April 2008,5,Most Chilled Hotel Ever,"Superb- lovely big rooms, real style, big firm beds, massive showers lashings of hot water. Brilliant pool area, lovely relaxing restaurant, excellent breakfasts, best coffee in Morocco. Gorgeous hall area with sofas and board games. 2o minutes to town along lovely sandy beach. Only criticism lights a bit dim to read comfortably at night- must be getting old. Kids loved it- and the camels to ride just outside1",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2007,5,A Very Friendly Riad,"This is a lovely riad with the friendliest staff of any hotel we have stayed at. Most of them speak good English which certainly helps when the first language is Arabic! The public areas are spacious and attractive and reflect the local architectural style. The bedrooms also are spacious, some with balconies and sea views. Maybe the bathrooms would benefit from a face lift, but overall this is a very comfortable riad with a lovely pool (although it was cold when we were there in November) and roof terrace with a super sea view. Very attractive dining room with excellent value (and quality) menu - about 140 dirhams (less than £9). The Riad is about a 15 minute walk along the sea front to the town. Very pleasant walk along a wide, well lit promenade. Taxis cost 6dhms…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2007,4,Great hotel,This is a lovely Riad and really good value for money. We travelled with our two children (aged 1 and 3) and the hotel staff were most accommodating and provided a really good quality travel cot for the youngest. They were also happy to provide an early supper for the kids in the restaurant. The hotel is about 20 mins walk along the beach from the town centre but the area feels really safe and quiet at night. The hotel was full when we were there so definitely book in advance.,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 September 2007,4,Riad Zahra is a good family run hotel,I stayed at this hotel from the 9th-13 Sept. I found the owners and staff very friendly and very helpful. The room was large and very clean and had a seaview. The food was good and very reasonably priced. It is not a luxury hotel but was comfortable and I think we paid a fair price. I would stay there again,Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 November 2006,4,A nice walk to town,"My advice to anyone travelling to Essaouira is to take the Supratours bus - the local bus is hot, dirty and takes absolutely ages. We arrived hot and tired at Zahra. The staff were great, very helpful after a long day. Zahra is a good 15-20 walk to the main centre of town. Don't be put off by this! It is completely flat and you can walk along the beach. We actually enjoyed walking along the beach back to our room every night after indulging in a huge dinner (walked off the tagine belly!). If you walk away from the town you can explore the dunes - they were shooting some kind of crusades film there while we were wandering about. The riad staff were great, the food was very good, the pool was lovely.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 December 2006,4,A good choice but a bit of a walk,"My partner and I spent 3 nights at Riad Zahra between Christmas and New Year and were very pleased with our choice: it's attractive, the price was very reasonable, everyone was very welcoming, the room was spacious and there's a bar! We ate there one night and it's a nice environment and the food was reasonable; a more than adequate option if you don't fancy the trek into the medina. It was nice to have a pool although we only sat by it for a couple of hours to relax. The only negative was that it was a bit bright in our room and the morning prayers seemed very loud but it takes a lot to avoid them I think! Also worth noting that it was pretty cold inside and there's no heating in the rooms. But I think that's quite normal. I'd say it's more like a 15 minute walk from the…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 October 2006,2,Riad Zahra,"I've just come back from a week at the Riad Zahra and I'm afraid I was rather disappointed. It looks very pretty in the pictures, but I found it noisy and uncomfortable. The hot water was erratic and when it rained several of the rooms flooded. I actually checked out earlier than planned. Bring ear-plugs and a sense of humour !",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 June 2006,5,A comfortable affordable riad with very friendly and helpful staff,"The staff at Riad Zahra in Essaouria were incredibly friendly, helpful and went out of their way to make our stay more comfortable. We liked it so much that we lengthened our stay. The prices are very cheap, the food is delicious and served in the colourful bar/restaurant area by the pool. We couldn't have found a better riad in Essaouira I'm sure, it was a five or ten minute walk along the coast from the medina - but we liked being in a quieter part of town. I would recommend it to anyone who fancies a stay in Essaouira - we really enjoyed our time there. They also organised a hire car for us which was great, so we drove to Oualidia one day, the beach there is much better for sunbathing.",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
 August 2006,4,Riad Zahra Mogador,"Riad Zahra, this place is a real find. We stayed there B&B for an excellent week's family seaside holiday, recently. We found it very friendly, with good food at lunch and dinner. The place is popular with surfers, windsurfers, kite surfers, French walkers and travellers interrupting their busy itinerary for some relaxing sea air. The rooms are clean, functional, furnished & decorated in modern Moroccan. Our room next to the roof terrace, on the top floor, had excellent views of the splendid beach. The bar and dining room overlook a decent unheated patio pool, long enough for a wake-up dip, and pleasant enough to amuse children, for hours. The hotel kindly arranged taxi transfers to and from Marrakech, to connect with our flights with Atlas Blue. For the faint hearted there are…",Riad_Zahra,Essaouira
