 December 2022,5,A Top Class Resort,"Family holiday with two adult children and stayed for 7 nights through TUI. The food options in the resort were wide ranging and very high quality. The hotel was very clean and was well run. The staff are tremendous, particularly the entertainment staff. Shout out to Nagib, Ismail, Jenna and Risla, who were a delight. There is plenty to do at this resort (eg darts, volleyball, table tennis, aqua fit, pilates), without feeling as if you have to do everything. My son lost his headphones whilst in the pool complex, which he tracked to somewhere in the city, so unfortunately it would appear that these were stolen by someone.

The heater indoor pool and gym are excellent facilities. Slightly disappointed that at an all inclusive five store hotel use of the sauna required an additional charge. Once checked in we were not offered help to our rooms by a member of staff and bags and were just told which direction the rooms were despite the hotel being huge. We initially got lost and had to come back and ask for help. The food at the restaurants was average but the staff were good and were constantly cleaning up and…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2022,3,Dissapointed,Currently staying at the Palace for the 5th time and what a disappointing stay so far. Normally this hotel is so chilled and relaxing even at this time of year but not now! Kids are running around the bar area and main lobby f from early morning until late evening. Not only is this loud and annoying but it is a health and safety issue for the poor waiters carrying glasses on trays etc. make sure you order a coffee early as you will be waiting at leat 10 minutes until it arrives in the morning in the lobby and at lunch time/evening you no longer get your wine in a bucket nor is it poured for you. What’s happened???? I know I sound like a snob but when you pay more and expect 5 star and it definitely isnt anymore it’s disappointing. Think it’s time for a change next year!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

After 3 nights in Marrakech, we were ready for relaxing in the sun and the hotel was perfect for that. Positioned close to the beach (with just the narrow promenade between the hotel gardens and the sand) meant we could easily stroll along the shoreline or sit on the hotel sunbeds. The hotel grounds are beautifully laid out offering a mix of seating areas with loungers, tables and chairs, comfy sofas and large sunbeds.

This time for 12 nights. What I remember most was how amazing the staff were. That was the biggest take away from our trip in 2017. This time we were coming with our 3 year old daughter and 3 month old baby so it was a very different holiday from our last! Right off the bat - nothing has changed (which is such a nice thing!). All the public spaces were still sparking like new. The floors and walls gleamed, which was no surprise as everyone took so much pride in their work and the property. There are a few reviews where people say they feel ignored at the bar. I don't really understand this as the hotel was really busy, if not full and I don't think I had to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Lunch in the snack bar was left overs from the previous day or hamburgers (daily) and evening meal was repetitive although somewhat better than breakfast. The best meal was one we had out that we paid for! The 2 restaurants were nice however you do need to book in advance and there was no sign of the Italian open at all. Pool bar drinks are not good.

They are so welcoming and make you feel comfortable and give you the confidence to get up and dance and have some fun throughout the day. Then at night they are the evening entertainment where they can really show of their talent. In particular, Aziz's breakdancing was mesmerising, never seen anything like it.

However, our first day and night were a terrible experience. The toilet plumbing smelt bad and made noises all night. Our room was on the ground floor so it was noisy all night due to guests. The hotel was very busy throughout the day and night - guests all over all the sun beds, in the gym and pools, and in all the relaxation spaces. Food was poor quality and abysmal range, not appetising at all. Smelt of alcohol everywhere. Rooms look dated and need renovating. Overall extremely poor for the price charged.

It was a lovely room with twin beds pushed next to each other, lounge area and big bathroom. The bed was rather hard and the duvet cover was extremely heavy but we slept ok. The hotel is beautiful throughout with a good selection of food and drinks on hand 24 hours a day.

People occupying them however, were smoking, drinking being, noisy and moaning if they got splashed by a ball....don't sit on the ones by the front of the pool then! The whole hotel (all indoor areas) are so dark, its a struggle to see most of the time. The power went out twice while we werw there and it was out for over an hour each time.

The balcony door fell apart on day one, see attached photos maintenance came within an hour and fixed it but we were a bit worried about it breaking again.

We also got a free upgrade to a executive suite over looking the sea, I can honestly say that it's the biggest hotel room I have ever seen, it was massive. The food was very good, but the reason I have given four stars and not 5 is the food was very repetitive. We understood there were 3 al-a-cartes, but while we were there the Italian was closed, (after asking some of the staff we were told it was due to them having problems with staff…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2022,3,Woefully disappointing,"Sadly disappointed with the whole Agadir experience. Our first impression of the hotel on walking through the door was ‘wow!’ The entrance, bar and lounge area is truly impressive with beautiful decor… it promised so much. From that point onwards however it was more than a little disappointing. The sheer size of the hotel is clearly not for us… if quantity over quality is your thing then this could be your ideal holiday. Canteen food served in a canteen environment… We tried the specialty restaurants… the Moroccan cuisine was terrible… the Asian slightly better but still not good. The drinks were standard for an all inclusive… limited choice and weak. The bedrooms were very good, large, well appointed and kept very clean throughout our stay. Sun beds were plentiful, although the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,4,Fantastic break,"Congratulations to the managers for creating this amazing experience and respect to the staff for working so hard to make it happen. Beautiful resort, great service, tasty food. Highly recommended. The pool is the highlight of the resort, and the lobby bar a very pleasant surprise, extremely lively",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,4,Perfect with imperfections,"Right where do I start.... I'll be honest and fair in this review because like any trip there are some good points and some that could make it better but at the end of the day, would I return?? That would be a wholehearted yes I would! We stayed for 10 days all inc and asked for a quiet room. We arrived late and there was some cold food/snacks available if we wanted after we'd checked in, although we didn't bother it was good to know we could've if we wanted. Check in was warmly welcoming, smooth and swift which was appreciated. The room, 4069, was spacious, tidy and clean. Yes, it overlooked an across the way car park but this wasn't an issue and was as requested, quiet. It was fairly close to the open bar terrace at night but that closed at 11pm so no issue. I will say this...…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,5,Perfect couples chill out hoilday,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful, from the lobby garden area and pool. The hotel rooms are good size. Only down side to room I was on the Aircon wasn't very good and shower was inside the bath and no light. Got courtesy room on last day with walk in shower so much better. The staff as amazing couldn't help you enough. From getting to seated in the restaurant to topping up drinks. Rashid at the pool bar was amazing so was Abdul wahid, also Hasan in the 24hr bar. The food was really good plenty to choose from, also the Moroccan and Krystal restaurants. Gutted the Italian was closed as only open in the summer. 1 thing I think could make the place better is the outside seat area near the pool could be used on a night doing a BBQ or some type of event adding more seating and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,5,"Great break, great food, great hotel, great staff.","We had a week here in October 2022. It was the first time we had gone to an all inclusive resort and we were very pleasantly surprised. It is a well appointed hotel, the rooms are large and comfortable and the pool area, the bars, restaurants and common areas clean and well maintained. The food was fantastic, especially considering the sheer amount of people catered for. A wide choice for all diets with a lot of variety including a daily tagine to get the local flavour. The staff were very good, some of them really outstanding and friendly. Particular mention to Abdessalam of the animations team, who played petanque with us was a great presence around the pool area and even ran a class to learn some Arabic/Berber language phrases. We will definitely return here after such a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2022,4,Don't let the other reviews put you off!,"Like many, we were worried when a slew of 1-star reviews flooded TripAdvisor for this hotel a few weeks before we travelled. Fortunately, I'm happy to report the hotel was very good, though not the 5-star experience it claims. The rooms are large but dark thanks to the dark wood prevalent throughout the hotel, and general lack of lighting. Here the hotel loses a star for the dark bathroom, drawers that didn't close properly, rubbish aircon, and a minor ant problem. The public spaces, however, are grand, spacious and clean, with plenty of seating. The pool area is a major draw, with its mix of sturdy sunbeds and cabanas. Yes, no one adheres to the no reservation policy, but the average care-free traveller won't have much trouble finding a bed, even later in the day. There's…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2022,5,An amazing holiday,"My husband and i arrived at this hotel on 22nd September for 2 weeks . We arrived around 11pm , checked in and went straight to the restaurant which was kept open for late arrivals . There was a good selection of food on offer . We requested a room change the following morning (just for a nicer view ) and we were given a great room on the ground floor right by the pool (Room 1020). The staff throughout the hotel were brilliant , . The manager must be so proud of his staff . The manager himself always made a point of welcoming the guests around the hotel , especially in the restaurants .The food was very good in all the restaurants , plenty of choice for different tastes .

 October 2022,4,A beautiful hotel with friendly people!,"We have just got back from a lovely week at the Riu Palace in Agadir. The hotel is beautiful; all of the furnishings are top class, the pool area is luxurious and it is exceptionally clean. Honestly, I’ve never seen a hotel so throughly cleaned every single day, in both the rooms and throughout all of the public areas too. The staff are mostly very friendly and go out of their way to welcome you. Three people deserve a shoutout and huge applause from management from our stay - HAFID in the restaurant, RACHID barman by the pool and IBRAHIM who helps by the pool every day - wow, these three gentlemen really looked after us. We hope the hotel recognise this review and thank them for their incredible service. We would highly recommend the buggy experience which we booked via our…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,4,1st time to Morocco,Just come back from our 1st visit to Morocco This hotel is lovely hotel grounds are well kept & clean staff are all very polite friendly & helpful Rooms are a little dated with dark furniture could do with some updating the bathrooms with the baths in I think that the bath should be removed shower wasn’t brilliant no light in the shower over the bath so was a bit dark when having a shower. Food was nice but was limited with the Italian restaurant closed for dinner & only one place to eat at lunch with the snack bar I think there could more themed dinners in the buffet restaurant both Krystal & Moroccan restaurant nice but again limited on food choice. Pool is really beautiful & kept clean everyday All in all we did have a lovely stay,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,4,Relaxing break,"Beautiful hotel! Weather was fabulous while we where there, staff at this hotel are great, do the best with what they have. Food is typically what you would expect from all inclusive, breakfast was always my favourite meal of the day, evening meal I sometimes struggled with. Cocktails are hit and miss depending on who makes them. They do serve champagne /sparkling wine and plenty of it! Although not always around the pool area but a tip here and there goes a long way! Pool area is what makes this hotel stand out…we had both a pool view and sea view. Would I return? For a relaxing break at the right price yes….if its action you are after, the area in general isn’t very lively.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,4,Honest honeymoon review,"So this is my honest review after 11 nights at this hotel following reading so many worrying reviews. We visited for our honeymoon and we’re not expecting 5 star London. We had been to Marrakech so knew Moroccan standards and this hotel blew us away with being so lovely! Reception was busy with a positive atmosphere when we arrived even after midnight, a number of members of the team on reception making check in pleasant and swift. We were blown away we were greeted with the restaurant being open AND serving hot food such as fries, steak, stuffed peppers along with breads, cold cut meats, cheese, desserts etc, we went to bed after travelling with full tummies- great start! The room was incredibly spacious! His and hers sinks, clean, fresh & welcoming with a vase of fresh…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 October 2022,5,Relaxing break,"Just coming back from this hotel, was unsure what to expect having never been to Morocco and reading some less than positive reviews recently...firstly the staff are excellent, you do have to tip to get the premium service levels, so I would advise getting some change and tipping, 20dir here and there is nothing for the service you get! The massive plus side to this hotel is the pool area! It is probably one of the best I've stayed in anywhere! The food is very good, good selection and plenty of different dishes for all (maybe not the greatest for children but I would recommend this place for children, there is very little for them to do here!) Rooms are a good size and stocked with drinks every day, cleaned well and are generally good! The hotel is stunning inside, one of the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,4,A beautiful place with some room for improvement,"Currently sat in the beautiful reception/bar area, as we've checked out but our transfer isn't until 9.30pm. Everything about this place is generally as beautiful as all the pictures you will ever see, reception area huge and luxurious. Rooms, starting to feel a little tired, but certainly didn't put us off in any way. Food, mmm I've not been impressed to be honest. Breakfast in the main restaurant wasn't the best, as said before lukewarm sausages, fried eggs with lots of runny whites, and some of the usual things you recognise don't taste as you'd expect them too. Lunch in the snackbar/Italian restaurant was extremely repetitive so as long as you enjoy burgers, pizza etc your ok. Evening meal in the main restaurant again, didn't seem to have a great deal of choice and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2022,3,"Beautiful hotel, staff could improve","I felt ignored at times by the staff, but the personal trainer at the gym, Mo, was incredibly friendly with me and had so much knowledge about the human anatomy.

Its stunning exterior and interior makes it appealing for all, whilst it is a big hotel, it never feels too big or too much. The pool and poolside is always kept so clean and comfortable. Facilities are also great - the indoor pool is lovely, gym is good too. The bar areas inside and outside are lovely, they create a great atmosphere and such comfortable surroundings. With the hotel being on the beach, the view all day from the hotel (especially sitting outside at the restaurant) was absolutely incredible & so special. The hotel has great access to everything you need! The fridge in the room also gets topped up every few days and they are more than happy to give you anything you need. I can honestly say that one of the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2021,5,Lovely baby moon,Came here for a mini baby moon! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel. The hotel is probably the best on the strip luxurious wise. The only negative I would say is the hotel is so large getting around was a bit of pain (unsure if this was because i was heavily pregnant) but nevertheless beautiful grounds and plenty of space to enjoy your stay. I previously stayed at Riu Tikida Dunas with family and would recommend that if staying with family,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2022,4,Another lovely visit,"Upon arrival we had our usual welcome, so many of the staff were pleased to see us again as this was our 10th visit to this hotel. The food is very nice although a little samey. In the main restaurant we were always looked after by Marouane, Samira, Mohammed and Yassine and in the lunch restaurant it was Fatima, Karima, and Hanane. In both restaurants we always had to table ready for us. One of the managers, Brahim, helped us with a small problem. Two others that deserve mention are Tariq at the pool and Safae one of the cleaners who always had a smile and kept the loos clean and sweet smelling.

We have now returned from a weeks stay and are happy to report the hotel is every bit as good as we remember! The food, service, rooms etc are all excellent and every bit as good. Taking everything into consideration this hotel is 5-Star in my opinion. Sure, if you go looking for faults, I’m sure you will find some. However keep in mind where you are and the price you paid.

Prior to Covid, we had been regular visitors to the hotel & couldn't wait to get back. However, even we couldn’t ignore all of the recent bad reviews about terrible food & upset stomach’s. We were getting worried that the hotel had taken a massive nosedive & gone completely downhill. Having spent a week at the hotel, we can wholeheartedly say it’s as good as it’s ever been. The food is fantastic. Beautiful fresh salads every lunch & dinner service. Tons of choice…..meats, fish, vegetarian, tagine etc…. If you experience an upset tummy, I’d say it’s more likely due to a change of food, over indulgence or too much sun. The hotel is clean. We never saw any mess / uncleared…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The standard of food across all is mediocre at best and after a few nights, it felt repetitive and more of a chore to eat. Specifically Crystal (the international restaurant) is bizarre, the menu on the booking app is different to what you get offered at the table, we sat for 30 mins without anyone asking us if we wanted a drink (bearing in mind its a small restaurant and it wasn’t at…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel building and gardens/pool area are lovely and the staff work really hard. The rooms feel a bit dated and could do with a refresh. There was also a terrible damp/drains smell. The doors to the bathroom are slats. This looks dated but also attracts dust. The room is not dirty, it just doesn't feel 100% clean. There was no light over the bath/shower. The ceiling fan did not work. We requested a matress topper as the bed was a bit hard and received it without any problems.

The rooms are very nice, if I could be picky I would say that robes should be provided in all rooms in a 5* hotel but they're not. I don't think I've ever received such excellent service.

Unfortunately, I was not helped with my luggage upon arrival at the hotel and the rooms were not up to a 5star standard. There was no slippers or robes, and there was no shower gel in the shower room. For dinner service I was not helped or guided to a table and neither were we offered drinks.

 September 2022,2,Spend your hard earned cash elsewhere,"Just returned from a 10 night stay. This is definitely not a 5* hotel, maybe 3.5 or 4 at a push would be more accurate. Positives: The pool and outside grounds are fantastically maintained. The lobby bar can make great off menu cocktails; the whole lobby is a lovely area to sit. The Moroccan and Krystal (except the disgusting foie gras on the menu - vile that this is on there) restaurants are wonderful. The staff are lovely. Quick to respond to issues raised on app. Negatives: Every outdoor area is full of smokers. The terrace, the outside dining area, the pool area. Even the swim up pool bar doesn’t mind people smoking, even though there are signs to say no smoking. Ruins it for a non smoker. The pool is completely devoid of atmosphere. Having stayed in the Riu Palace Riviera…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2022,3,Decent but 5 star it is not,"Trying to be as balanced as possible. Not sure what passes for 5 star as never been to Morocco before but we think 4 star is more of a fair reflection. We’re now in to our last 24 hours of our stay here and here’s our review of our holiday. Reception staff; not overly helpful or friendly. When asking about booking a table it was a curt “ use the app”. Despite the app telling us the restaurants were full we walked past and they were half empty at the times we tried to book. Also had card reprogrammed twice as it stopped working and we couldn’t get into our room, we spoke to other guests who had the same problem - some more times than us.

Everyone puts in 100%, always happy to help with a smile on their face. Hamza in particular is very talented and makes the team what it is, without him and a few others the hotel would be boring.

The hotel itself is lovely and looks great but the standards in other areas weren't the best. The food is basically the same everyday with little changes each day but we got fed up of it as we just ended up eating the chips, pizza and pasta. The cups, plates and cutlery were quite dirty too and hard to find clean ones! We also hoped there would have been more choice in alcoholic drinks.

We asked at the reception if it would be possible to change room and despite the late hour we were given a new room, cleaned and quitter. Hygiene issues were constant. From cockroaches walking around the restaurant area and bathrooms, to the dirty aspect of the restaurant floors, there was this constant feeling of lack of training/care from the bars/restaurants staff.

 August 2022,3,Rating - 3.5 / 5 (Disappointing),"Service - Slow and unorganised. Tables aren’t prepared and takes them a while to serve. Some staff were slow and ignored your presence. Food - Food has little to no taste, I often didn’t eat much. Most of the buffet is not labelled and when you ask about ingredients even the chefs aren’t sure. Difficult for vegetarians, especially with the lack of food label. Drinks - Cocktails were awful, overloaded with syrup. I personally gave up drinking them. Training needed. Cleanliness - Hotel exterior is maintained very well but restaurant cutlery was usually dirty with food stains and fingerprints. Staff move cutlery from one table to another. Rooms - Nice size and design but toilet is dark and dingey. I asked for bed sheet change after being bitten by bugs several times and maid…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,3,"Disappointed, Definately not a 5 Star hotel.",At best a 4-star. The location is nice but near a very busy public beach with a promenade. The rooms are nice but there are no toiletries (shampoo or conditioner). There were reported bugs in the bed in one of our rooms and no action was taken. Restaurant - Food was not labeled well and was often very confusing. They do not cater to vegetarians well or understand the meaning. The choice for vegetarians is poor and placed next to non-veg and we often noticed cross-contamination. The chef was rude and did not seem to care. The restaurant manager was the same. They seem to have been in the job too long and there needs to be a need for change. Cutlery was often dirty. Pool bar staff would serve males first and avoid serving a female. The cocktails were often hit and miss.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2022,4,This is no ordinary review,"Can someone who's stayed recently help. We stayed in February 2022. For 11 days, in the central areas, for 24 hours a day, the hotel played ""This is no ordinary love"" by Sade as background music, on continuous loop. It sent me around the bend. Do they now play other background music or muzak or the same old Sade tune?",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,5,Fantastic service and staff,"We visited RUI Palace at the start of August and it was nothing less than superb! Large hotel complex, very friendly and helpful staff and good drink and food variety. The entertainment team did an outstanding job, including everyone (not being pushy) to join in the activities. The shows in the evenings were of a high quality and one member of the team in particular, Jannat Dradi was fantastic with the children. She always had a big smile on her face and had a fantastic energy. I couldn't praise her enough, she should be managing the animation team. Overall, the staff were lovely and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,5,Absolutely STUNNING Hotel - Best in Agadir!!,"What an AMAZING hotel!! Beautiful from the moment you walk in!! 4 restaurants - all of which were absolutely first class! Food really was nothing short of fantastic!! Main buffet restaurant has a mix of live cooking stations, Tagines, salads, dessert counters, all full of flavour and impeccably presented. Then there is a pool / snack bar restaurant that doubles up as an Italian in the evening. Again, lunches were fantastic - fresh fish, steaks, salads, paella, pasta, all sorts. There is then a fusion and a Moroccan restaurant. Top, TOP quality food and presentation!! (I’m a bit of a foody and these outlets were well up there with the kind of place you pay over £100 for you and a partner to dine in!) And when they say all inclusive, there is no messing. No you need to pay…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2022,1,Horrific Experience,"Do not stay at this resort! Hotel is old, tired, desperately need in renovating/bull dozing, food is awful. Whole experience was horrific from our arrival and to such an extent we left after 2 days as we simply could no longer tolerate it. Our issues included: - no assistance on arrival - no towel vouchers that were treated like gold! - 1 x room was not prepared, dirty, towels on floor & 1 x room did not have beds set up for our young children - breakfast restaurant is like a prison food hall, dirty, loud, tables not set, cutlery bent and food selection disgusting if replenished at all - sun beds hoarded by guests - beach heavying, no service/attendants, cigarette butts & camel dung everywhere - stray cats all over the resort - drink selection vile - safe not working,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,1,Strongly advise you AVOID,"Firstly TUI are an absolute joke taking money off people by selling this hotel as a 5 star because it’s not. When complaining about being unable to book a restaurant due to it saying it’s closed on the App was told by reception staff that the hotel doesn’t like guests booking restaurants. When they did book for us we experienced the fastest ever service in the Moroccan restaurant; whilst still chewing on my main dish, plates were cleared and deserts instantly served. After staff cleared our dessert plates our full wine glasses where then taken away as we were told to leave because they wanted to shut. The Italian restaurant is not an Italian, it’s a left over buffet restaurant from lunch. I can’t comment on the Crystal restaurant as my symptoms developed and I was unwell with…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,2,Not a 5 star hotel,"Do not book this hotel if you are expecting a 5 star hotel with a private beach. Dreadful. Food, service and cleanliness is awful. Cross contamination in food area, food experience just a chaotic mess. Drinks poor, waited ages for any form of drink or glasses, never any water, cutlery, drinks or plates. Lunch buffet dreadful, broken dirty umbrellas, not enough space. If you want a sun bed you have to set an alarm. Can't get to the pool through sheer amount of crammed in beds. Gym area really poor, hardly any equipment, no water, no towels and no soap in the toilets by pool and gym for 4 days even though flagged to hotel.

 August 2022,5,I can’t wait to be returning,"I would like to start off and say a massive thank you to everyone at the hotel for helping me enjoy every moment of my stay, and I couldn’t fault them. I have just returned home and have already been thinking about going back with my friends for a girls holiday. The entertainment team have been amazing. Always wanting to have a chat but remembering who you were to carry on a conversation or even wanting to get the most out of you by joining in activities so you are making the most out of your holiday. Also giving you nicknames which they would remember such as for me it was “G” or “George” which I love as that shows the effort into wanting to get to know you. The darts were amazing and lots of fun ‘Mizou’ did a great job at this and has shown a lot of dedication into learning…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,2,Hotel,Staff can be so rude when order drinks near the pool. Rooms have bed mites. My nieces were covered with bites and when reported was told can’t be beds and probably be bitten outside. Restaurant manager completely didn’t care when told him that we are 12 vegetarian and why is meat being served near vegetarian section. As some people just use vegetarian spoon for meat n cross contaminate vegi food. Some food was so bland no taste. When we ask the staff if vegetarian one says yes and another says no. Completely untrained staff.. Some of pool side bar staff completely doesn’t know how to make cocktails or simple cold coffee etc. Reception can be little be brighter and have a/c.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Friendly faces with smiles 24/7. No hesitation in recommending the hotel. I do wish though they policed the reserving poolside places. People left towels late at night or were getting up ridiculously early to reserve sunloungers that were never occupied until lunchtime.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,2,Shame,"I went to the hotel as alone single parent with my daughter. Generally speaking couldn’t fault the hotel save for when either myself or my daughter needed something e.g a drink, they would serve males first and wait for no reason. As a female this became more upsetting on the holiday! Such a shame!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,2,Average stay,"We stayed for a week in August, our first time to Morocco! Pros: The hotel itself is stunning, rooms are spacious and have everything you could need. The pool area is huge plenty of sunloungers but be prepared to wake up early to reserve the cabana beds (most days men were asleep on them saving for the family). Being so close to the beach was a massive plus as you can walk along the promenade. With TUI we booked a sand boarding experience it was 10/10 highly recommend! Cons: We found this hotel had no atmosphere throughout our stay, the entertainment team tried but it was very repetitive. There was 1 speaker around the whole pool area so if you aren’t close there’s nothing going on. For an all inclusive the drinks were awful. The cola was flat, a cup full of ice and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Balcony chairs great, Very comfortable beds with good air conditioning and a fan. Had kettle for the morning tea and soft drinks in the fridge. The housekeeper did a grand job and the room was spotless. Pool clean albeit a little cold when you first get in. Pool towels nice and the sunbeds comfortable.

 August 2022,4,Lovely hotel,"On arrival at the hotel it's a very beautiful place, really impressive. Check in was swift and restaurant was left open despite the late hour of check in. The rooms are large and spacious but our view was of a car park and our 14yr old son had a sofa to sleep on. We did request a bed for him which was delivered 2nd day but was very uncomfortable. Our bathroom had a bath bit was a bit rusty on the outside whereas our family was next door and had a nice refurbished shower room. The hotel grounds are very well kept and the swimming pool area well maintained.

There are both positives and negatives. Unfortunately for us, the negatives do outweigh the positives, and means that we would not be rushing back! Firstly.. the positives! -Hotel grounds - absolutely beautiful, reception area is huge, plenty of places to sit, plenty of bars, and pool area really is beautiful. -Animation team - This team are just AMAZING!! They made our holiday! So friendly, so energetic and so much going on! Shout out to Kadijya, Hamza, Outman, Anas, Yousef etc! Such brilliant people, you really did make our holiday brilliant!

 August 2022,3,Not 5*,"On first impressions when walking into the lobby it’s very grand and impressive as you would expect for a 5* Part of our package was the most basic room , when we arrived to our to it was very lovely and better than expected but when we went to our bathroom we were surprised as there was dirty towels on the floor, used toiletries on the sink and the bath was filled with water. We think that it had been used for people that have checked out and use the shower in rooms before they leave the hotel. We rang down to reception and they sent up housekeeping who just gave us extra towels. We would have left it at that but in the morning we used the shower and the pressure was awful.

The room we were given was unacceptable as the air conditioning was broke and the fan in middle of room was literally hanging off ceiling. The smell was very damp . We were so tired we just wanted to sleep and re -address the situation in morning. We went to reception first thing and explained we couldn’t stay on this room for 2weeks as the smell was horrid also the other problems .

 August 2022,5,On site photographer Aziz,I am going to write a full review of our family holiday separately as have we have had a somewhat mixed bag of experiences and it wouldnt be right to include them here. This review is soleley to acknowledge the service of the on site photographer Aziz. He is always around taking great shots and really nice guy. He even assisted me to obtain replacement photographs when I unfortunately damaged the originals saving me from a very disappointed family. A great asset to the hotel and one that anyone visiting should use at every occasion.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,5,Beautiful hotel and amazing staff,"This was our first holiday post-Covid so I was a bit apprehensive about travelling. Being a single parent too it was important to find a hotel that I would feel safe and secure with plenty to entertain us. The hotel didn’t disappoint, the staff couldn’t do enough, particular thanks to Sarah in the main restaurant. She is an absolute credit to this hotel. Making us very welcome each evening and there to offer help whenever I needed it, when my son was poorly one evening. The animation team are little stars and always happy and encouraging the children to participate in games and activities. The food was beautiful and the chef even prepared me a gorgeous present of Moroccan biscuits. The TUI reps were also on hand and very informative and helpful. Overall I was very impressed and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2022,2,Food was terrible !,"On first arrival the hotel looks very lovely. The buffet was left open for us as we arrived late. Put it this way no health inspection would be passed. No fresh salad, no fruit and all the food is full of grease. In the mornings it was like a free for all, whilst sliding on the floor due to all the grease I made my way over to the only thing edible….. bread. To then I watched a man pick his nose pick up the bread and put it back. We didn’t eat for 3 days and was quite poorly. Talking around the pool area we were not the only ones. All same foods every day.and the al a cart restaurants are all beautifully done out with the same food from the buffet just tarted up. Pool area was nice but people like to claim there space as everywhere so get up early. Entertainment also ……",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,3,Family was unwell for two days,"The rooms are nice and the hotel is generally clean. Staff all pleasant in the main. Much bagging of sunbeds but that is a given and there are always plenty left but not of the wooden ones with the think mattress, these are very comfortable. The pool music first thing is super chilled until midday then the aqua gym starts and then you cannot hear yourself think, it’s far too load and continues (not quite as load) for most of the day. Getting drinks at any of the bars is pretty easy. The beach is very close, it’s not the nicest as I don’t think it gets cleaned properly at night. It’s a big public beach and quite busy but ok. The main issue I have and would have given a 1-2 star if it was just on the food… Much is cold or just a little warm… this really isn’t acceptable, how…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2022,4,Summer Holiday,So let’s start with the overall rating probably not quite 5 star. You need to ask for things to be replenished in the rooms rather than it happening by default. Drinks selection is quite limited in choice. Some areas are looking a little tired as well. However the staff are excellent and always happy and willing to help. Overall experience was really good and great value for money.. would recommend to friends if travelling on a slight budget,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2022,5,Great location,"This hotel is in a great location not only by being next to the beach but also near to the town and harbour. The room was great and the staff friendly and helpful. On the down side the food was very much the same every day and the meat on the carvery often very dry due to being overcooked. While the hotel has evening entertainment nobody seemed to be able to tell you, in advance, what it would be that evening. If you want a cocktail from the bar you will need to tell them how to make it and if it contains rum, gin or vodka it will all usually come out of the same clear bottle. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2022,4,"Lovely hotel, would recommend!","The RIU hotel is lovely. The hotel itself, the lobby, rooms, dining rooms and pool is great!! I would definitely say 5 star. Our only criticism are the drinks. Unfortunately the selection is limited and the cocktails are really not that good a quality. A real shame, as it is the only thing that lets the place down. This may be because of covid and it’s not back to it’s best, maybe they will improve. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. For the price for a 5 star it is definitely value for money. Never been to Morocco before but would recommend. All the staff are lovely and really attentive. Couldn’t fault them.

Rooms are large and well equipped with restocked mini fridge with fizzy drinks and bottled water. We originally had a non pool view room which was fine but no views so we asked if we could move and luckily then got a pool and beach double aspect view. Everything about the hotel from cleanliness service and food was excellent. However be prepared to get up early to get a sunbed round the pool as some selfish folk will put a towel out reserve sunbeds and not turn up till 2 in the afternoon!!!

The staff did not wear face masks at any point and the hand sanitizer on the restaurant entrances were often empty :( We struggled to get tea coffe milk topped up in our room room service would never appear sadly amd reception were not very helpful when we mentioned this!

Food was repetitive and the main buffet restaurant was like a cattle market so we avoided this and either ate at the a la carte restaurants, snack bar, or at restaurants off site. Drinks were nice on the whole but the wines were not good so we avoided the wine. Visited the spa one day for a massage and as I got changed afterwards I saw the masseuse remake the massage bed with the towels just used for my massage so I have questions about the hygiene standards of the spa.

The food was bland and boring, we were all inclusive but still ended up going out at night time, we tried some of the restaurants on site - the Italian restaurant is just the same buffet food as at launch time when it's also 'snack restaurant'. Also at breakfast there was remainders of dried food from the night before stuck to the serving areas - disgusting really. The beach isn't private it's just a cornered off bit of sand on the public beach which is dirty and unattended and there is nowhere to get a drink.

I have just written a review of another hotel we stayed in in Marrakech and that was 5 star! We arrived and werent given anykind of welcome or drink but check in was quick. Went to our two rooms and immediately went back to reception. They were overlooking a digger pile driving poles into concrete and the rooms were basic. One of our party was in a wheelchair and had asked for an accessible room. We were a party of three and there were only two beds.

 July 2022,3,Disappointed,"Beautiful friendly staff, rooms very clean but a bit tired, food could do with being a little better but good enough. We have stayed in 5 star resorts all around the world and unfortunately this is not a five star so try not to be too disappointed it’s okay street vendors are a real pain and most of them leave you alone after a firm no Thankyou Would I come back? I think I would but not with as high expectations",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2022,1,Average & never 5 stars,"On day 2 of our holiday, seems more guests have arrived and now cannot get sunbeds around the pool. The pool staff just say “we’re full” and reception just don’t care/help after asking twice. They do not adhere to their own rule about guests blocking beds - their towels should be removed. Cocktails are awful - they belong in a 2/3 star hotel. Outside bars have a very limited drinks selection Lunch is held in a smaller restaurant only so it’s too busy and cramped. It’s like feeding time at the zoo with people pushing in front of you. Wife fell ill today from the food/drink too. Have made a complaint to Riu and Tui but neither have provided any response whatsoever. The hotel looks the part, but actually very average. Hugely disappointing",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is really modern with very good facilities (swim up bar was our favourite) The staff were very friendly and very welcoming. Our room was always clean and decorated nicely, just like the hotel! There are several different pool activities everyday which are really fun and there is entertainment in the evening, as well as live singers every night. The food is really nice considering it’s an all inclusive buffet and there is a lot of variety, and I would definitely recommend booking the Krystal restaurant!

Good selection of drinks including branded spirits such as disaronno, grants and smirnoff. They also stock a 0% beer which as a non drinker I appreciated. Pool staff were really helpful and couldn't do enough for you. Overall, this was a pleasant experience but not up there with the best I have stayed at for a similar cost.

If you go with small kids, you couldn’t choose better. The food was good in the main restaurant and served also in the national restaurants /Moroccan and Fusion /. Not so good choice and quality at the pool eatery. The rooms are large and well equipped. Try to avoid located from the north side. They are cool but too dark. There is a easy access to the wide and impressive beach from the hotel. Great for jogging or morning walks. In the busy weekends days, the staff had the problem with the smooth service. Probably they were not enough number of people working in the holiday days. Generally, we were satisfied with our stay and consider to come again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2022,5,"Great hotel and service, good for gluten free","We have just returned from a week at this hotel. We were very impressed with the hotel which had many positives such as good size rooms, great pool area, good access to the beach, and great service from the staff. We did choose to tip the waiting staff at the pool area, which did help get a more attentive service with regard to drinks being brought to us more frequently. One of the issues travelling as a coeliac is finding safe gluten free food. I can report that this hotel had a good understanding and several of the chefs and waiting staff went above and beyond to ensure that additional gluten free food was prepared. For example the Chef Rashid was on hand at most meal times to advise on which dishes were ok for me to eat in the buffet. He also prepared several desserts,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2022,5,Beautiful Resort good for families,Just arrived back from a week here beautiful hotel room was lovely pool area stunning all the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the pool staff they couldn’t do more for you! Beach is nice shame about the local men trying to sell things gets a bit much but we’re freindly. All inclusive food was very repetitive same thing every day but lots of choice. The hotel staff are super friendly and helpful and the pool staff they go above and beyond I’ve never had service like it and have travelled a lot! The hotel is amazing so you don’t need to leave the hotel but there is not much around outside local or anywhere to go so we got a little bored with our 2 yearold. We didn’t use the kids club for babysitting as they have to be 3 but they have on sight babysitters for £10 an…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2022,5,A great stay,"We are currently waiting to be picked up in reception and we can honestly say we have had an amazing week! The hotel is spotless, wherever you go there is always someone cleaning up, the rooms get done every day and the cleaners do a great job! The staff go above and beyond for all customers. Anything you need, they sort it for you. They are so polite, friendly, caring and always have a smile on their faces. The waiters are amazing throughout the day and night, Ousmall and Inham (I think that’s how you spell their names) really stood out for us. The cocktails are nice, beer is nice and the spirits! There is a few bars across the hotel which is handy, the one in the lobby is open 24 hour which we loved! The animation team are great, they’re always around throughout the day…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2022,4,Lovely hotel,This is an amazing hotel with lovely staff and food choice. The vegetarian options should've been clearly labeled with more choice but you won't go hungry. Room cleaning needs to be improved. You can walk along the beach to the shopping area,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,Wonderful stay,"This hotel was excellent we have never stayed anywhere else where the staff were so professional, friendly, and helpful. The gardeners do a marvellous job with the grounds which are kept immaculate. The place is kept really clean the pool area being washed down each morning. The two speciality restaurants were of a good standard & the service in the buffet was always excellent.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 April 2022,5,The Warmest Welcome Imaginable,"We finally had our holiday to Riu Palace 30 months after our last visit and with more postponements than there were parties at number 10. We flew Easyjet from Gatwick at 6:30am on a Tuesday landing in Morocco at 9:00am local as this time the country was an hour behind UK, rather than an hour ahead, when we last visited. The clocks went forward just before we left. The early flight meant we were checking in at 10:30 and in time to grab a continental breakfast. As always check in staff were efficient and helpful. We were advised that as we had asked for a specific room it would not be available until made up after the previous occupants had checked out I have reviewed this hotel after every visit and am constantly amazed at how the staff recognise returning customers and always…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,Great anniversary break,"I would highly recommend this hotel, and I know its said a lot on here but would definitely return. Following a slight delay on our out bound flight we arrived at the hotel around 01.30am check in was really quick - this is helped by being able to check in online prior to arrival - due to it being our wedding anniversary were had been upgraded to a pool side room. The gentleman on reception told us there was food available in the main restaurant if we were hungry. Our luggage was given to a porter to bring to our room, so we just made our way to the room. I then decided to have a wonder around the hotel to see what was around and grab a drink from the 24hr lobby bar. Due to the late arrival we got up late and went for the late breakfast in the snack bat, this was just as…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,Marvellous!!,"Just returned after a great holiday with our dear friends. Staff were excellent, Youseff who served us in the main dining room was a fine lad and a credit to his position. Little Sara who welcomed us into that dining area was a lovely girl also. With Karim at the bars and Hanane in the snack restaurant also very attentive and helpful. Very clean hotel with nice pools and we had no problem finding sun beds throughout. Lovely grounds and an excellent beach a few steps away. Room was comfortable if a little tired in places, but overall absolutely fine. Food was excellent with a nice variety for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. Would recommend this hotel if you are after a relaxing holiday with most services that you would need.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,What a fabulous holiday,"This was the first time to Agadir, Morocco and was not sure what to expect. After a delay in Birmingham we arrived very late at the the hotel and we were delighted to find out they had provided hot and cold drinks and a light supper for us. Room was spacious, beds were very comfortable and top marks to Housekeeping. The entire hotel was spotless. Food was imaginative with a huge variety and something for every palate. Pools were spotlessly maintained. Animation team worked really hard to delivery and were great with the children present. Aqua Aerobics was fun and engaging. Have to commend the hotel and every single staff member went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. Pool staff ensured that they took care of everyone and really went out of their waay too. We never…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

All staff throughout were extremely helpful and quick to get you anything you needed wether it be information or a drink. Nothing was to much to ask. Entertainment team were constantly around talking to guests and promoting things to do even though that’s not our thing we enjoyed talking to them special mention to Tico who was so easy to chat to and made a special effort to come and see us before we left. The buffet was on constantly and food was always good especially the range of desserts which were out of this world. Special mention again to our restaurant waiter Brahim he went above and beyond to make sure we had a lovely…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,Perfect stay,"First stay in a Riu hotel and I have to say it was perfect, from the check in staff, rooms and Wafu our housekeeper, restaurants, bars, and all the staff that looked after us during our stay who made up the team Rui Palace agadir. Too many people to individually recognise. But they were all so kind, friendly and efficient. Well done",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,3,Visit during covid wasn’t told about restrictions so would visit again when things are back 2 normal nice looking resort,Sadly I have to rate this low as we were not told the hotel had restrictions of the bar closing at 9pm and no alcohol after this time this was during covid restrictions We were celebrating hubbys 50th and our wedding anniversary so had we been made aware of ALL restrictions in place at the time we would have booked elsewhere No entertainment at night so we made our own and got a few guests involved too The manager was lovely and allowed us extra time outside before lights were switched off The pool area lovely and day entertainment was good The pool bar kept running out of drinks which was not good The food was nice with plenty of choice and catered well for English guests thank you Room was lovely and spacious and kept nice and clean maid was really nice Rooms have…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,5,A fantastic break,The staff are fantastic. So friendly and welcoming. Plenty of sunbeds available. Ask for a glass of wine and they give you a bottle - no questions asked. Spacious room with a balcony. Food was great - plenty of choice. Excellent service. Just what we needed after the pandemic. 5 star experience at a 3 star price. And right next to a massive sandy beach. Recommendation: tip generously :-),Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,2,Never again,I am writing this review whilst sitting round the pool week 2 of a 2 week holiday with my husband. On a positive the staff are wonderful and make this place they go above and beyond. Room is very clean. However I am sat by the pool whilst a group of 8 young English lads are very loud singing swearing and screaming. I was also kept up last night by another large group of French men partying in the room next to me till the early hours ! 5* hotel this is not!! Food is very repetitive and not very warm. I am very disappointed with the quality of this Riu palace hotel I will not be back.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,The best hotel I have ever been to,"I have been to many hotels but this hotel is the best by far it has everything walking distance, 5 star all inclusive the staff are absolutely amazing this is absolutely worth it. The staff like Mouna the animation and many others are absolutely brilliant. They always checking up on you making sure you have no problems, always caring and energetic. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone one of the best hotels in the world.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,GREAT HOTEL FOR FAMILY HOLIDAY,"We have just returned from the hotel and overall it was a great 10 days we had staying here. Just to start there are 2 issues that I feel would need sorting if I was management. First the kids area needs updating and more to do for the kids.Secondly the cocktails were all too sharp and bitter. I made some cocktails up and I noticed a few people asked what they were and asked for the same. The plus side was the staff were more than happy to make them for us. The most positive for us was the staff, everyone was amazing, nothing was trouble at all. Our table was setup every meal for the kids, our server Hussain (apologies if i have spelt that wrong) was outstanding, every single day 100% put in. The hotel overall was top notch....everywhere was clean...the pools were great for the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,4,Great hotel. Great Staff. Shame about the food and pool.,"Clean, friendly staff, close to shops and the beach is just across the promenade. Drinks are great (especially the mojitos) however we often struggled with the food. Very repetitive even in other restaurants. There’s a vegetarian corner in the buffet restaurants which I’d be disappointed with if I was a vegetarian, thankfully I didn’t have that problem however I may of been more disappointed with the food. Some days are definitely better than others but I expected more from a 5 star hotel and especially a RIU hotel. During the day there’s plenty to do for everyone, from the beach, the shops, the pool, bulls, water aerobics etc. It’s unfortunate the pool is so cold that you can barely stand staying in it for more than about 5 minutes even on the hot days. Even the “hot tub” is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,Fantastic experience,"FANTASIC experience from start to finish. The staff are what really made our stay memorable, they've been so accommodating, welcoming and friendly. I cannot stress this enough! The hotel itself was beautiful, our room everyday has been cleaned to the best standards. Food and drinks did not disappoint. I would definitely recommend 100% and would certainly go back to this hotel! One downside was the walls of the hotel was too thin but can overlook this as everything else was top knotch. Really can't fault our stay!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,5,Holiday,We have been to this hotel about 20 times in the last few years despite Covid-19 and we are glad to say very little has changed and this includes most of the staff who always look after us .We always look forward to seeing our friends again as we now call you friends.Our number of visits to this hotel says it all.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,"Super hotel, centrally located","We had a wonderful week stay at this hotel. Everything was to the highest standard especially the staff. It was our first time going all inclusive as we usually like to sample what a city has to offer but we made the right choice here. The food was excellent and as the city was just coming out of covid, some places were not yet open. The location is excellent- right on the beach and central with a great promenade for walking. You will have no safety fears here, the people are wonderful and very friendly. I can not reccomend this hotel enough.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,4,Wonderful friendly staff,"We have been to Morocco on many holidays and always love the holidays, this was no exception! This hotel has the most wonderful, friendly staff who can’t do enough for you! Special thanks to our wonderful waiter Hassain who greeted us each lunchtime with a table outside and a bottle of red wine waiting for us! The room we were given was beautiful and had a great view of the pool and the sea/beach area. There are tea and coffee facilities and soft drinks added to your fridge daily (coke, Fanta orange and sprite). A safe is available free of charge. There is lots of storage snd hanging space available. European plug socket adapter is needed (two pin round) Our room had a large shower (no bath), two sinks and basic toiletries provided and a basic hairdryer in bathroom!

 May 2022,5,Beautiful hotel with first class service. Staff are amazing!,"Spent 4 nights here April/May 22. This is our 5th stay at a Riu hotel. We always find that their hotels are clean, with friendly and attentive staff and good quality food. Riu Tikida Palace is the best Riu experience to date. The reception/lobby area is impressive. Vast with beautiful decor. Live music every evening we stayed from around 2030 till 2300 with a break for live entertainment by the Riu Fun team on the stage in a separate but close by area of the hotel. Drinks include good selection of brands with generous measures of alcohol. Drinks menu is extensive. Food also contains a wide selection of choices, with a local Moroccan section. Amble fresh fruit on offer. Food is superb quality for all-inclusive hotel, we enjoyed every mealtime we had here. The stand out…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2022,5,Lovely hotel and great staff,We are seasoned travellers and whilst I would agree this is not the standard of a 5 star in London or the US we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and size of the hotel and standard of the rooms. The pool area is expansive and whilst pools themselves are cold (even the heated one) they were refreshing and the sunbathing areas were some of the nicest we have experienced with cushioned sun beds and multiple double/couple king size sunbathing beds. The food was sometimes less than hot but great variety in main restaurant and lovely experience of higher end catering in the Krystal International dining restaurant that had to be pre-booked. Less than impressed with the Moroccan specialist restaurant though. Drinks were reasonable quality/choice but were let down by very…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,2,Disaster of a holiday,"where do I start !! Firstly, booked holiday with love holidays and a week before due to fly was announced there was no longer any availability at our original hotel and was offered tikida palace instead, which we obviously accepted! Arrived at hotel to be told we had no booking and it had been cancelled, took 2 hours to sort and actually get our room, very stressed by then ! room was nice enough, wouldn't say 5 star at all, no robes, slippers or iron, normal 5 satr have these facilities ! 3 days into holiday the most awful sicknessI have had for years and 2 days later then diarrhoea, and partner had developed same symptoms by day 2 so spent 3 days in bed and 2 weeks back home still not feeling 100%! On day of leaving was then told we had £1200 bill to pay and basically not…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,4,"Nice hotel, but restaurants need improving","This is a very pleasant hotel, the rooms and public spaces are well maintained and the gardens are lovely. The major thing that lets the hotel down is their inability to serve hot food at the buffet restaurants either at breakfast time or in the evening. The cook to order food was quite nice, but the pre cooked food served from Bain Marie’s was as a general rule tepid at best. Whilst we were in resort (April 2022) the whole resort seemed to be virtually closed down, many hotels were boarded up and the roads were undergoing major road works to such an extent that there were no available pavements. The beachfront promenade whilst pleasant was barely illuminated at night with about 75% of the street lights being off. I don’t know whether this was as a result of covid, but it did…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,5,The staff are amazing,"We got back yesterday and I had to write a review as we had such a great time there. From beginning to end this was a lovely holiday. The hotel is very nice but what makes it is the people. Every single member of staff couldn’t have done more to make this enjoyable, I must name Soumaya, Hanane, Marouane, Mohammed and Sara from the restaurant - they were amazing and felt like family by the time we left. I have never been to Morocco before but now can’t wait to come back. If you want to relax, be cared for and looked after this is the place for you",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,5,Fabulous,"Just returned from here . What a fantastic place . Staff so friendly professional and helpful nothing was too much trouble. The main bars and reception are beautiful and well kept. Greeted on arrival with a cocktail and our baggage taken to our room. The. Room was immaculate worth the upgrade for the pool and sea view. The food is delicious, plentiful and extremely varied , We had a party of both vegan, vegetarian and meat eaters there was so much choice you didn’t know where to start we all could have gone back numerous times , the desserts were delicious too and there was always soup fruit and cheese and biscuits. Bottles of wine and bottles of chilled water served at the table, drinks served in the hotel and around the pool were all branded and the cocktails were delicious. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,5,Amazing Hotel & Staff,"What a find. Stunning hotel by a wonderful beach. Although the hotel looks amazing, the staff really made it. So friendly and alway helpful. Felt really welcome and it was kept immaculately clean. I’m not one for their entertainment but others seemed to really like it. Good live music in the bar area of an evening and the extra little bit around easter for the kids was a great touch. Even found a punch bag for workouts! Would recommend Flag beer too!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,3,Needs help,Pros: Good Location (on the beach) Friendly Staff (eager to please) Cons: 20 year old gym equipment /rusty (awful offering for such a large hotel) Lack of plant-based options (rarely any alternative milks - only at breakfast and sometimes the staff put dairy milk in the soya milk container which could result in dire consequences from an allergen perspective) Lack of training for staff (staff knocked on our room and then proceeded to open the door at 11.30pm to bring some tea bags- which we had asked for at 6pm. This woke me and my daughter up),Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,It doesn’t disappoint,"Stayed here 6 times prior and still my favourite! Recently went to Marrakesh and have been to other Moroccan hotels but this is my favourite. This hotel has such a lovely feeling to it. You can get everything you need for a lovely relaxing time. I highly recommend asking for a pool side room if available. I have just booked to go back in May and can’t wait. I’d like to add that I’m a total diva but no need in this hotel! Nice bars,casino and marina that are worth visiting too.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,4,Poor entertainment,Lovely clean hotel one of the best we have stayed at but the lack of entertainment was so boring it consisted of a group of morrocan reps jumping up and down cartwheeling on stage every night then hunting every pretty girl down and pestering her all night food was very repatative and drinks were to lovely sandy beach and pools gardens are wonderful could not fault the hotel but it was so boring they lumped the children's entertainment in with the adults so the kids run riot every night no discipline would not return,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2022,4,Good value,"Been coming here since it opened in 2012. Had not been for over 30 months due to Covid. It was great to be back and meet up with staff who have been there for many years. What a welcome we got! I would mention that there are extensive roadworks going on in Agadir tourist area with pavements and roads being dug up. It will be great when finished but just now you have to walk on roads so take care. As for the hotel, since last there they had repaved the whole area round the pool and gardens. There were also new mattresses for the sun beds. However, the pool boys were too busy hiding to assist you to carry mattresses to your sunbeds. We had cracked toilet seat when we went to our room after checking in, reported it to reception and a member fo staff was there within an hour to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 April 2022,5,First visit but it won’t be the last...,"We have just returned from a wonderful week here. Having never been to Morocco and wanting some early spring sun we have not been disappointed. The hotel and grounds are lovely, our room very spacious - a little tired in places but very much a non issue. Food is good although I would’ve liked more Moroccan choice at the buffet as sadly we didn’t get to eat at the a la carte (our fault for not booking soon enough). All premium drinks I could want are included, I do love a glass of fizz! The staff absolutely make this place, absolutely nothing is too much trouble. I needed something from the pharmacy but was advised it was closed due to Ramadan but quick as a flash, one of the reception guys got someone to bike it over to another pharmacy further away for me and collect what I…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The Hotel has a large clean rooms with comfy beds, reception will try to supply you with anything extra you might need. The grounds are huge with a heated pool outdoor and indoors too!

 April 2022,5,Family friendly with everything you need all under one roof!,"This is a beautiful hotel with stunning grounds, friendly, staff who are helpful and courteous. Covid hasn’t gone away but it’s always great to be travelling again and we had a smooth transition from arrival to the hotel. It’s a privilege to be back travelling largely thanks to the NHS and our vaccination programme allowing us entry to countries. I saw some reviews about the Heavy French clientele but they are allowed on holiday too! There were plenty of Brits as the week went on and the staff have really good English, which is way better than my Arabic or French for that matter! Weather was breezy but better than we expected. Despite the air temperature you’ll need sun cream, but pack a jumper or fleece for the evenings or days when there is a shower. Look out for the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,A wonderful hotel,"This is our second visit and we can’t praise this hotel enough. Special mention for Yaseen and Samira in the main restaurant Ali g with the lovely young lady who greeted us at the entrance of the restaurant. The food is varied and the desserts are so good be prepared to put on weight. The lunch restaurant is nearby the pool area. The food again is varied and and a high standard, special mention to Hanna and Fatima who helped us improve our basic Arabic , a new word every day. The whole hotel was cleaned constantly, if there is to be a criticism it would only relate to the hand dryer’s. Whilst I mention certain staff all staff are friendly and help to make this a special holiday",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,4,Great Hotel,"We arrived back home on 31st March after spending 10 relaxing days here. First time here to this hotel and to Agadir. Hotel was fabulous, decor was beautiful and so big. Our room was spacious and overlooked pool and had side view to the beach and sea. Most of the staff were so helpful and eager to please you and would do anything for you. We did notice that if you tipped them the service you get is exceptional!!. We tipped the bar waiters in the lounge save waiting at bar. Also at end of holiday tipped waiting on staff in dinning room, and cleaners who kept our room spotless. Food was plentiful and good choices the only thing was it wasnt hot enough and sometimes undercooked. I asked the chefs to cook my food more and they did without any hassle. We found breakfasts to be cold…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,Did not disappoint,"We have waited for 2 years to return, and yet again we were not disappointed. I cant thank all the staff enough as they are all fantastic, cleaners do a fantastic job keeping the Hotel spic and span. slight downfall was it had a lot of French people and i cant believe how rude most of them are, please and thankyou to the staff costs nothing. We took our son and his girlfriend and they really enjoyed themselves, my son and i had a game of golf whilst we were over there, with the free courtesy bus from the hotel. I have only just returned 29th of March, and i am just about to book again for October, and my son and his girlfriend have started saving so they can join us. Some people say the food is repetitive, however if you eat chips every night what can you expect.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,"Absolutely amazing hotel with lovely hardworking staff.
Most definitely worthy of being a 5 star hotel.","Quite simply a beautiful hotel! All staff work extremely hard and are so friendly. The management team certainly know how to ensure that they and their staff ensure that the hotel lives up to the 5 star rating. From the cleaning staff, the gardeners, the pool staff, restaurant and bar staff, reception staff, there isn’t a single thing I can fault. The food is absolutely amazing and the quality of the ingredients used very clear to see. By day 4 I had already booked to go again and cannot wait until May when we return. Thank you for a wonderful holiday and we look forward to seeing you all again soon.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,3,Meh 😕 okay-ish,"Staff were very nice and tentative - special shout-out to Loubna and Ibrahim Agadir itself at the moment is very quiet- this is obviously due to the pandemic. We walked to the marina one night and there was a few street beggars that wouldn’t leave us alone. Street merchants can be annoying and in your face. As pointed out by other travellers, entertainment is not very good and we were in bed by 10. The resort is so beautiful but definitely need to up their evening entertainment. Lots of people from France who were very rude and lacking basic manners and walking around like they didn’t want to be there lol Food was nice and good for the 4 nights we were there- any more days and we would’ve been fed up. Can get abit relative but breakfast was my fav. Indoor pool was not…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,4,Good but …….,"Staff 10/10 food 9/10 Rooms 10/10 but….don’t book this as a family holiday I have to be honest it was fab and luxurious for us as a couple but there is nothing really outside the hotel and nothing for evening entertainment, so I would definitely not book this hotel with kids as there is nothing here for them, we saw a small hut for the kids but never saw any entertainment for them? Lovely for a chill but we spent every night back in the room at 9pm watching Netflix as there was no entertainment. We watched a very amateur grease one night but other than that we were disappointed as the only other entertainment was a 2 man band in reception or dreadful karaoke which was pretty shocking considering this is a palace? Everything else was really good rooms pools and food just…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,4,Grand Hotel. French Heavy,"This is a huge hotel with some 500+ rooms. The scale of the grounds and the hotel lobby and restaurants is impressive and luxurious. Firstly, the hotel is spotless which is a fete in itself with such a big place. Staff work night and day keeping the place clean Staff on the whole are fantastic. Service is brilliant. They respond to your beck and call. Food can be a little monotonous as withany all inclusive but that's down to the individual to not keeping heading for the same firm favourites and try other stuff. The clientele during our stay were heavy on the French side. General manners don't seem to be something that matters too much and that's saying something being English! Agadir itself doesn't seem to offer a great deal but this hotel at the price point it is offers…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,1,Poor beyond belief,"A week into our stay and I want to leave. How disingenuous of Tui to fail to mention that their target market for this hotel is French and that everything is geared accordingly. The food is generally abysmal and although fans of patisserie might enjoy the efforts made most offerings are poorly cooked, unattractively presented, and most disturbingly served cold. Some of the worst all round food I have encountered in 50 years of travel and the the hotel and catering industry. The hotel benefits from from some lovely facilities and lovely helpful staff, but is looking faded in places........we will not return",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,Week Stay,"We stayed for one week at the beginning of March. Great hotel. Rooms incredibly clean, the only annoying thing was lack of sockets and no mirror near them unless you unplug the TV. Food was actually really good, variety was great, but the temperature of the food was a little disappointing, it was just never hot enough unless you got the fresh cooked items when they were topping up. I just couldn’t fault this hotel, the animation team were a great laugh and just lovely to talk to daily, especially Mo, Outman, Hamza, and Yousef. Always made an effort to come and speak to us, check in and generally just a great bunch of lads! I would definitely return and highly recommend this hotel!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,Me n her,"Just got back.. Can't fault it. Fantastic place, nice staff, great food. Plenty of space and beds around the pool areas. Nothing much when you leave the hotel apart from a small village and a walk on the seafront. Will defo return..",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,Best holiday in Agadir,"Had such a lovely time in Agadir, hotel was beautiful with delicious cocktails and entertainment but the best part was meeting our favourite breakdancer and magician, Zizo and Tico - from the animation team. They took good care of us all week and made sure we had the best time. Gonna miss you guys, we'll be back soon to visit we promise! ❤️",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,Palace fit for a princess!,This was one of the Best holiday I have had. And it’s thanks to the Riu hotel. It was splendid. A beautiful 5 stars. Staff were amazing. So polite and professional. Nothing was too much trouble and they always had a kind approach to Customer service. The ground and reception were immaculate and stunning. You feel like you are in paradise. Three pools. Inside one was heated and beautiful. 2 outdoors pool. One heated with a mini Jacuzzi and a “cold” pool. There were very clean and great design with loungers everywhere with very confortable mattresses. The room was so spacious. It was spotless with gorgeous Furniture. The bathroom was amazing. Powerful shower and a giant bathtub! The restaurants were truly wonderful. Never ate such tasty and varied food. The chef should be…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2022,5,Lovely staff,We went here for a few weeks ago in the February Half term. The staff at the hotel was all really friendly and always happy to help. A want to give a Big shout out to Nordin who was part of the entertainment team and who worked at the kids club on the day we got there. He was brilliant with our little girl Zana and he always helped us to make her happy! 5 star rating to Nordin!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2022,5,Little March break with friends.,"We arrived @ Riu Palace Agadir on the 3rd March and stayed for a week. During that time, we were treated like royalty by staff. In the main dining room Soumaya and Hannana looked after us, having our table ready and getting us anything we needed for both breakfast and lunch .We couldn't have asked for more. All staff throughout the hotel were amazing and nothing was too much trouble for any of them. Thankyou to you all so much. Our room was on the 2nd floor which was perfect as the restaurants were one floor above and pool and beach one floor below. We ate in Marrakesh on 2 nights.This was our favourite.On one of the nights it was our friends birthday and the staff brought bubbly to the table and a birthycake.She also had flowers delivered to her room which was a lovely touch.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2022,4,TOO MANY FRENCH KIDS,Arrived 24th February and all smooth going at the airport. We were in time for dinner on the outside terrace where we were looked after by Redouan Hamas Mohammed and Fatma. Brilliant staff and we had a very warm welcome from them as we've visited the hotel a number of times so recognition all round. Also a mention for Hassan who worked the lunch time outside and also Kristal He was so attentive and made us feel very special. Food good and plentiful as always. Couple of negative points . No Air conditioning only heat so had to keep patio windows open all night to keep cool. So had to put up with kids (assume older kids) shouting and screaming around the pool area at 2.30am. All French and they all did what they liked with no parental guidance. Scooters and skate boards…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2022,5,"Fantastic hotel, I have already booked to return!","I travelled on the first flight from the UK so the hotel was just reopening again for tourism. I travelled as a solo 32 year old female traveller. Hotel facilities: the hotel itself is beautiful. The photos on the website and the TUI site do not do it justice and make it look a little older. In real life, it is really stunning, with open spaces and palm trees, seating areas to relax, and beautifully kept gardens. Pool was stunning with poolside bar, I read reviews of people having trouble to get sunloungers, I personally didn't experience this but the hotel was quiet during my visit so may be different during peak times. Rooms: Very spacious and nice design, they have a sleeping area and a small step down to where there is a sofa and table and chairs. There is a sort of walk…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2022,1,Disappointed,"Great hotel if you have kids and can get on the super deals the French got, if you want a quiet holiday AVOID. Very noisy at night from other guests. Ive stayed in quieter 3 start hotels in mayorca Hotel is clean and the staff are amazing, some guests checking out and re locating to the Tui blue adults only a few doors down the road,",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2022,1,Was the best but not now,"Stayed in this hotel 4 times in the last 6 years for a few weeks every February. Previously tried a few of the other hotels in Agadir but found the Palace Hotel the best. The hotel like you to wear masks when you self serve food in the restaurant but it’s pretty relaxed elsewhere. Morocco covid test everyone on arrival but it took only 45mins from leaving the plane to sitting on the coach to the hotel. Unfortunately the hotel has turned into a “Kids club” and won't be returning. Always liked a good mix of guests in hotels, young , elders, different nationalities as it adds to the holiday experience but it’s not been a relaxing break this time. The hotel staff are patient, forgiving and good humoured but are totally outnumbered and can’t cope with the sheer numbers of kids.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2022,5,Agadir after re-opening,"Thought it worthwhile sharing what it's like coming into Agadir as it opens up again after a total air flight ban. Arrived on Thursday on the 1st TUI flight in since October. Tui check all your documents as you drop your bags for the flight. At Agadir airport, the flow through passport control, baggage reclaim is very smooth and efficient. The only thing they checked was whether you had the Moroccan entry document. The big additional step is a big white tent you walk through outside the terminal where everyone is lateral flow tested. This was for us almost instantaneous. It's then straight onto the coach to the hotel.. Heard nothing since, so I assume the tests were fine. So I'd say, once you get through the pre departure 48 hours PCR test yuck, it's smooth and easy and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2021,3,Not what I expected,It’s just disappointed how people think that everyone who comes to another country is looking for just sex . I came with my girlfriend to this hotel just to relax and enjoy the sun but the manager of the hotel sadly was trying to get me to bed even after I explicitly told him that I only like women and I’m with my girlfriend already he insisted at first and he left with an un disgraceful face . I was so angry with that because he of all people should make sure that we are good and we are having a good time,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2021,3,Nice hotel bad management,Me and my girlfriend came to this hotel to relax since it’s our first holiday since the pandemic but the manager of the hotel is a real pervert. He tried to Hit on me and take me to his room even though he knew that I’m here with my girlfriend. I thought the hotel tolerates homosexuality and I explained to him that I only like women plus I’m already with my girlfriend but he keeps insisting and that what made me so frustrated. I didn’t even want to get out of my room anymore. I just kept ignoring everyone at the hotel and tried to go to the beach more often and only come for food and drinks,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,4,Hotel 4* staff 4* food 3*,A very clean hotel where most of the staff are very helpful. The food was average and we found the buffet was better than the 2 fine dinning restaurants. It was good Value for money .tui rep was good and a day trip to the atlas mountains is recommended. Its worth eating out a few nights to break things up.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,5,Another wonderful visit,"After a 2 year wait we at last managed to get back to our “second home”. Upon arrival we were offered an upgrade to a Junior Suite, which we gratefully accepted. We were greeted like old friends by so many of the staff some even remembering our preferences for food and drinks. Some people have complained about a lack of sun beds, I don’t know where they were staying but we went down between 9.00 and 9.30 and were usually some of the first out, empty sun beds all over the place. The animation team came and sat with us for a while everyday there was Mo, Yousef, Ayoub, Outman and his friend who’s name escapes me and Tima. The food although sometimes a bit samey was always nice and there was always plenty to eat. Breakfast was always the same but it had to be as all fronts were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2021,5,Amazing holiday!,"We are staying in this resort 7 nights and would like to express my gratitude to all the staff for making our holiday a memorable one especially a big thanks to receptionist Loubna for being so a such professional and prompt in everything it seems she is very familiar with customer care attitude and thanks again for helping us to enjoy our stay,well done. The rooms are so large,clean,fresh and safe ( 2021 and 4054).Restaurant services amazing and the food is plentiful. Entertainment team just brilliant! Bar cocktails are good enough and plenty of choice.Gardens are lovely with lots of beautiful corners to relax in the sun. We would absolutely highly recommend it!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,4,Nice hotel mines one of the kitchen staff,"Very nice hotel . Me and my family really liked it , it’s so nice and clean the stuff are very welcoming. The animation is great and fun . The service is nice but one of kitchen 2nd chef really took all the fun I once asked him to get me a soup for my grandchild and he literally blocked me out and ignored me . And when I came back again he started shouting some bad words in Arabic to one of his colleagues he was not nice to me at all . He was very grumpy, and every time he walked by he would look at me like the devil with protruding eyes . He ruined our holiday for real , everything else was good. His name is a abdelilah saw it on his badge",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,5,Must still be the best hotel in North Africa,"Arrived on 14th October for 14 nights all inclusive. We have visited this hotel on several occasions and always found it to be a great experience. While the Hotel is operating under strict Covid 19 restrictions, the staff are wonderful and always go out of their way to ensure that your needs are met whenever it is possible. Covid 19 restrictions affected bar opening times (11 pm curfew) and there were no theatre type shows from the animation team. However, the animation team participated in a lot of ad hoc activities, both during the day and in the evenings. When I have had a problem at this hotel, a quick call to reception and the problem was always sorted in double quick time. While we were on holiday, the Moroccan authorities banned all inward flights from the UK,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,4,Riu - Cash cows,"Finally we have got away from the UK after nearly 2 years of rubbish and what a amazing trip we had. First thing shout out to the Tui Rep who was brilliant after the borders were closed 2 days after we had arrived lol - just a shame we actually made it home. The hotel is amazing - room was amazing, staff are just awesome and the pool was lovely and refreshing lol - my husband would say freezing. The food was just lovely lots of fresh cooking every day, for us it was perfect but I can see how others have issues with it, especially with kids as if you have a fussy eater then they may struggle to eat anything other than pizza and chips every day. We have been to many other hotels that have many more options. Negatives - as the Brits were leaving there were lots of French arriving…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,5,it is a 5 stars hotel for sure,"the hotel is very big and clean the pool area is absolutely stunning the food and drinks are amazizng , the staff are very polite and helpful i have no complaints about this hotel , the service was beyond my expectations . i do recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to get a way and chill and have some sun and fun",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,2,Not a 5 Star!,"I bought myself and my children here for a break and was surprised when I arrived that they still claim to be a 5 star resort. This hotel is 3 Star at best Old decoration, employees are embarrassingly clingy and over the top. Get to the meal times early as their is nothing left after the vultures decend The pool is like a ice bath",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,1,Avoid Avoid Avoid,"I would not return to this hotel ever When we checked into the hotel we found the reception team extremely abrupt, as we arrived at 11pm there was no food at all so we had to go hungry u til breakfast. In the morning we went to the pool only to be greeted by a sea of towels on the beds and no people, it was bought to our attention that the staff around the pool were reserving them first thing in the morning so if you want to get a good bed you have to get up at 5am The activity staff were super annoying, coming round and disturbing your day one after the other all day non stop. When you have to pretend to be asleep so they go away you know it’s too much. As for the rooms they are very dated with old and dirty bathrooms that need improving desperately hopefully the hotel…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,5,Amazing!!,"It was my first time in Morocco but my cousin had visited 2019 at the same hotel. It was absolutely amazing! The hotel is beautiful, the food is nice, the staff are really nice too. A special shout out to Mehdi he made us feel welcome, he is very polite, funny and friendly! The entertainment is very good too special greetings to : mo , hamza , tico , hotman , jennie and dija Although there is no show yet . But we have fun with them at night with karaoke xx and my cousin plan on booking again at the end of 2021 so we can come back and see everyone again soon!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,5,Loved our trip,"We have just returned from a lovely week here. There were 2 families in our group and we were looked after and seated together at every meal time. All of the staff were absolutely amazing and they couldn’t do enough for you to make your holiday amazing. Tipping is not expected but it’s certainly appreciated and you definitely get better service and makes the holiday even better. Al-oui on the pool bar during the day and lounge bar in the evenings was awesome and always looked out for us keeping our glasses topped up. Animation team worked tirelessly always stopping for a chat and asking how we were etc. Reception dealt with any enquiry efficiently, printing out our locator forms no worries. Grounds staff maintained the gardens to a great standard. The pool guys were always on…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,2,2 Weeks All Inclusive,"Full Review Hotel Public Areas The hotel is designed to be of a high standard, although the age is starting to show in certain areas of the building, walls, tables and ornaments are getting a little old and are showing signs of wear and tear. Where ornaments and statues have been glued to the sides, they are coming away and looking very shoddy. Lighting is of a good quality and all light bulbs are working and changed regularly. The corridors to the rooms are clean and tidy although Ice Machines are missing where signs clearly show they should be. The sofas near the elevators down the corridors are stained with drinks and water stains and do not look very attractive.

 October 2021,5,"Beautiful hotel, great teams","I went at this hotel for 3 nights alone. Food is very good with fresh fruits in the morning ! All the teams are smiling and warm, dedicated . I was very happy because they give me a suite😃. Once I arrived in front of the room, it was already occupied with clothes. So I came back to the reception, and they admitted that they have made a mistake. So they gave me another room, facing the swimming pool. The hotel is less then 100 meters from the beach and close to the town center. I will be back",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,3,Dissapointed,"We started visiting Agadir and staying at the Riu Palace approx 10 years ago and enjoyed the wow factor. We visited some 4 or 5 times afterwards until we felt it was looking a little tired in 2017 so went elsewhere, still with Riu. Re-visited again this month (October) as we thought it had been refurbished, unfortunately it hadn't, what was tired is now in desperate need of update. We had to move room as wardrobe doors were hanging off, safe didn't work, no tea cups....moved to another room, mattress had an exposed razor sharp spring sticking out, safe literally had a plaster on the rear mechanism. Mattress was quickly changed and safe worked but looked very poor. Very little evening entertainment, maybe Covid related so no complaint, mention it for information only. Staff were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,5,"Fabulous staff, food and golf!","Having stayed in this wonderful hotel a few years ago, I returned with 3 friends to play golf. The location is ideal for some rest and relaxation between days of golf. The hotel is on the beach, accessed by a security gate, with an extensive promenade, where we walked for 30 minutes down to the lively port area or in the other direction to the private beach area belonging to the King’s private beach house. Though attempts are made close to the hotel to sell tourists artefacts, beach clothing and trips , a polite “no thank you” is all that is needed, there is certainly no pestering and when the average monthly wage in Morocco is £250, it is perfectly fine to spend £12 on a lovely swimsuit cover to wear around the pool. We cannot fault the service, the food and the exceptional…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,5,Brilliant,"Unsure as to how there are any bad reviews about this place. Entertainment staff, bar staff, waiters and waitresses were all welcoming, friendly and extremely good at their jobs. Absolutely no complaints about anything. There were many food options, could have possibly been a couple of extra for vegetarians but still a large variety. Taste and variety in general was fantastic. The room was clean and extremely spacious. The bar staff, waiters and waitresses never left your hand or table empty of drinks and they were also on hand to help with anything. A very clean, welcoming hotel with plenty to do. I could not recommend visiting here enough. Put it this way, I don't leave many Trip Advisor reviews, so when I do it's for a good reason!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2021,1,Mis management. Nothing to do with 5 stars,We are now staying in the hotel. It is a bad hotel with uneducated staff. We chose this hotel because we thought it was fun for the kids. There is no children's pool. Animation really doesn't do anything with the little ones. I See them doing nothing. The food is really always burnt. Yesterday's food is also available tomorrow. Ice cubes in the drinks taste strange not made from botle of water. Staff has no idea what 5 star really is. They try their best but there is no manager to send and help them. Room is old and stains in the bath. Balcony is dirty full of stains on the pillows. Cabinet does not open. The a la carte ristorante is ridiculous.

Our room was spacious, clean and had an amazing view of the pool and beach, with a large balcony too! We had a short walk to the pool, which had plenty of sunbeds every morning. This may be due to the time of year as we were there early October, but even at the peak time of day there were plenty to choose from. We did visit the beach a few times during the day, but went to watch the sunsets every evening.

ALL staff were utterly professional, calm, considerate and friendly - thank you everyone ! Riu training and standards were superbly maintained throughout the hotel by General Manager Snr Miguel and his dedicated team. Also the very helpful TUI local rep. The first thing I did on returning home was to make another booking to return.

Enjoyed the food, weather was amazing. Kids had a great time, the kids club was very good and staff were excellent. Only negative was people leaving towels overnight for spaces near the pool. This was not needed as there was plenty of space and the hotel could be firmer with guests that did this. The hotel is on the promenade and we enjoyed our evening walks.

The only issue was that we had a meal in the Moroccan restaurant and the staff were quite rude about us having the children, and would not accommodate the needs of our 2 year old and would only provide the set menu. Unfortunately we had to leave as my little boy couldn't eat the food on that menu. Something we have never had to do before! The animation team were great, Tico made such and effort with our little boy,our son i's quiet shy but he really was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,4,Thank you Animation team and Hotel Staff,We are a young family of 4 and have had a fantastic 10 days stay at this hotel and are very sad to leave today. It has not been without it's faults however. Requests made via the app were never acknowledged. I initially reported the air conditioning fault via the app and had to follow it up at reception later the next afternoon as we had not had a response. Same with minibar requests they were never fulfilled. We also then had a problem with booking the restaurant. On 24th September I was told there was no availability in the Krystal restaurant for early sittings (as we have young kids) but I was told on that day that they had availability in the Marrakech restaurant the next day so we booked that instead. We turned up at 7pm the next day and the restaurant was closed. I…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,1,Hotel is lovely but customer service is VERY POOR,arrived in hotel just after 12am. room allocated by receptionist. Went to room and tried to sleep but the bathroom fan was on so loud and never went off. looked at the phone but no numbers list on how to call reception etc. walked to reception which was 5 mins from room. receptionist said the number is told verbally and not written next to phone. He said he would get someone to check the fan and for me and my wife to wait in room. We went back and waited over 30 mins and no one came. now it was past 1am and we were very tired. went back to reception and same guy said no one was available to check. I asked him when was he going to tell us. he said sorry. i said i didn't want a sorry. He said i can give you another room but it will be two single beds and not double. i said this…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,4,Great value for money! A beautiful resort with great potential but be aware of the disappointing weather in Agadir,"If you don’t read anything else then read this: If you are looking for clear blue skies and sun for the entirety of your holiday then I would not recommend Agadir. Due to the close proximity to the beach, resorts along the beachfront have a micro-climate with a lingering mist which blocks the sun. Out of 11 nights we only had 2 full days of blue skies - extremely disappointing. The weather apps will tell you that it’s clear but there is a mist that lingers above the resort. In summary, we throughly enjoying our stay here. It’s a beautiful resort and has a lot of potential with great staff and excellent value for money. It’s not quite the 5* resort you’d expect in Europe but it met our expectations for the money we paid. We probably wouldn’t return due to the disappointing…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,5,Another Amazing holiday,"Absolutely fabulous Rooms are clean and spacious, felt very safe in regards to Covid, The location of the hotel is spot on for the souks, Staff are amazing the buffet restaurant special shout out to Abdullatif luka he was amazing, The bar staff are brill, The hotel is stunning it is very dark compared to the modern palace in taghazout but would love to be back here already I don’t have a single fault with this hotel",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,5,A Great hotel,"Ok folks, let’s start by saying before your go to Morocco at the moment, print out all your paperwork at home and before your leave the hotel [ the rep Zineb can do this for you] do not relay on your mobile device, say no more…. Trust me on this So I am going to upset a few by saying… ignore the negative reviews, after staying at this wonderful hotel and I have travelled over many years to many countries I am sure they were all on the Manchester flight. So don’t worry Northern folk, always eggs bacon at breakfast, pizza, chips and burgers, lunch and dinner, that’s midday and teatime, and beer..and look at a World map before you travel 😂😂 Food Very good and a great variation every time as above 👆 Hotel and grounds Clean and very tidy in all areas Staff So so helpful,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,5,fabulous hotel,"I read the reviews before I went to this hotel, so glad I went and made my own mind up, we had a great holiday, all the staff are great and cannot do enough for you, we had a problem with the air conditioning, and reported it to reception and it was sorted within an hour, they come round every day to replenish your tea coffee and sugar, nothing is a problem for them, the food was lovely and the cakes to die for, this is truly a 5-star hotel and the manager is always around the hotel and very approachable. The animation team is excellent and is around the pool all day and has activities every hour if you want to take part. The rooms are very spacious. we have just returned and will definitely go again, don't listen to bad reviews and make your own mind up, this hotel is fantastic…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,3,"Riu Palace Tikida Agadir, disappointing holiday stay.","First time to Morrocco was very excited as never travelled here before, always curious about visiting a Riu hotel. Initial start was not great, had to take our own bags off the bus and carry them over to the hotel, there are no ramps here luckily we were able bodied bit anyone who had a disability or older would struggle here . Check in was easy and reception was very friendly , we were told that the restaurant was open ( we did get there at around 11.30pm ) but by the time we got to our room and back it was closed, not 24hr food here,although advertised as being 24hrs. Our room was lovely, abit dated but nevertheless it was nice with a part sea view, we were on the third floor, go for a high room as the views are amazing and anything lower than two and you will just see the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,5,FABULOUS,FABULOUS TRIP This visit has been fabulous. I have heard so many complaints which have been frankly floored. The hotel has been excellent as has the food. Our room was clean and very spacious with everything we needed for comfort.Staff work so hard to ensure guests are well looked after. The TUI rep Zineb has been superb and a credit to her employers. Given the government restrictions they have pulled it out the bag in the face of adversity well done all concerned.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,2,Early to bed,Just returned from a weeks stay at this hotel.Firstly may I say the 2 stars awarded were for the staff and the room which were both great.I consider myself a savvy traveler and I was aware of the 9pm curfew after reading up on the resort.What I didn’t know was the hotel decided to stop all entertainment and alcohol sales at 9pm.This resulted in horrendous queues at the one bar stretching out of the lounge and into the outside terrace.The daytime pool bar was also very busy and long queues occurred there.I’ve stayed in many Riu hotels but have never come across the very poor standard of food being served here.It was all served Luke warm at best and some of it was stone cold.It seems they are cutting costs because the quality of the food is the lowest grade.With most flight pick…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,5,Amazing holiday,"Returned for our third visit and again cannot fault this hotel. Immaculate throughout, friendly,efficient service from everyone. Food and drink excellent, just love the morning coffees from the lobby bar, and entertainment team They were nice and sociable and talked to us every day. and a lot of activities Especially beautiful girls : tima , jenna , and dija 🥰 We will be returning very soon as we love this place one of the best Riu ever .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,5,Here now,Currently staying at this hotel i have not been to a different resort in 15 years and its honestly lovely here food is good plenty of choice rooms are large and comfortable Animation team are amazing have really made my stay so much fun Hamzas zumba is soo much fun and everyone can join in but all Animation are amazing mehdi is friendly. I will be returning to this hotel 😊,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,4,"Nice week away, shame about the drinks","On arrival my partner and I were very impressed with the hotel. We arrived after 11pm via TUI, check-in was quick and easy. The staff on reception were extremely friendly. Room: this was massive.., so much space. I had to ask for our twin beds to be put together which made a super sized bed! Our room looked out over the pool with a sea view (worth the extra money we paid for the upgrade). Certain things in the bathroom could be updated. One thing missing that we’re used to at 5* hotels was Robes, they were not provided which was a shame. All hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Food: It was really good, no complaints. Lots of choice. The only issue we found was small children helping themselves and touches lots of food with their hands. Drinks: having arrived the tour…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,4,Left a little disappointed,"I would really like to give the hotel 3.5 rather than 4 as there are positives, negatives and disappointments. Disappointments: Communication to guests was very poor regarding the closure of the bar at 9 pm and while I appreciate this was not the hotels making they should have public ally kept guests informed. Negatives: I no longer consider this hotel to be of 5 star quality, the furnishings and decor don’t appear to have changed in the 8 years since we last visited and standards seemed to have dropped - for example the dress code for dinner has been abandoned? Positives: The staff from cleaners through the restaurant and bars were excellent, attentive, always helpful and willing to please. In conclusion I would say that although we enjoyed our time at the hotel, we were left…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,5,4th time in morocco,"Just arrived home from another amazing stay at the RIU Palace Tikida Agadir. All the hotel staff were as friendly, helpful and efficient as always. They all seemed to be genuinely pleased to see us, remembering us from previous visits and welcoming us back like old friends. The more we visit this hotel, the more we feel it’s a home from home. We love the relaxed atmosphere of this hotel. You can join in with activities if you wish, but there is certainly no pressure. The entertainment team was lovely and friendly variety in activities , we did enjoy especially the bingo time / tequilla haha with tariq (tico ) the lovely guy with his funny bingo calls ,also the dancing next to the pool was amazing . The food is exceptional, lots of choices daily. Well presented and so so…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,5,Memorable Holiday,"Can’t say anything except WOW. It was a 5 day trip, couldn’t have wished for more! From start to finish it was perfection, hotel was amazing, staff were first class, everything about this hotel made it a wonderful experience. The food is very good. There is a large selection each day which always includes burgers, chips, spaghetti bolognese, pizza and plentiful salad. The variety is the different fish and meats which are either fried, grilled or carvery. Great choice of vegetables cooked in different ways. You can't miss the SOUK LHAD is massive and of course goes without saying that you must barter in all the shops! The bar close at 9pm no more alcohol but we understand that due to curfew The Entertainment was good during the day many activities for adults also at maxi club…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,1,"Avoid, not worth your money",Avoid!! Do not waste you’re money booking a holiday here. We’ve travelled around the world and this is a completely honest review. Similar to us you will be tempted to book considering it’s a 4.5 star rating after over 5k reviews but honestly this was the most disappointing holiday we’ve ever had. The very first thing you need to know if about the Morocco curfew. After 9pm there is a ban on transit unless you’re double vaccinated but this only seems to apply to tourists. We thought this wouldn’t affect us as we usually stay at the hotel during the evening but we couldn’t be more wrong. - There is no evening entertainment. This has stopped because of the “curfew”. There are any any shows so if you’re looking for entertainment then avoid this hotel. - Day time entertainment…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,3,Very disappointed not value for money,"I have rated this hotel as 3 stars although the staff are very polite and friendly and their service is great. It can not be said of the restaurants the all in the inclusive holiday we paid for with TUI is far lacking in this hotels restaurants out the 3 themed ones only one of these was open, we were told the Italian was shut due to covid the Moroccan was closed because Moroccan visitors don't like Moroccan food on holiday we asked about other holidaymakers using the Moroccan restaurant it the answer was no. So we could only use one of the 3 the main restaurant was buffet style and the food was ok with plenty of choices for all at lunch and evening meals but now in the hotel managers wisdom the main restaurant is now closed for lunch and they are now using the Italian for late…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,2,"When inspected it’s passable, the staff are great though.","Today, after 3 previously disappointing days, the food was passable, the tables were set and clean, the fountains were on in the pool and there were plenty of staff. And then we saw the hotel in the midst of being inspected. I can’t speak for what will come tomorrow as we thankfully leave tonight and I look forward to being able to get a drink or food after 9pm with no curfew to shut all activity down. Not the 5 stars our tour operator promised but a shout out to the lovely staff who are overworked and still manage a smile.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,1,Never again,"The first time I've been on holiday where I'm actually looking forward to going home. I don't know how this hotel has been awarded 5 stars its 3 at its best. Cocktails are pre maid, food is cold and I've never heard of a restaurant run out of vodka at 3 in the afternoon. Beer tastes like dish water unless you get it in the restaurant. Entertainment has been two men singing the same songs every night, so we've been in bed for 8.30. As for the private beach it's about 6 rows of beds taped off, you get mobed from locals selling things as soon as you stepped foot outside The first day we arrived I thought I'd found my new holiday location as we usually go to Lara beach in Turkey. Second day was OK Third day attitude of staff changed towards us once France had opened up their…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2021,1,Not what we expected,"To whom it may concern, We travelled via Tui as a family of 5 to the Riu Palace in Agadir on the 9th of August for 10 nights. We were so excited to finally get away as a family and I can honestly say I have never been so disappointed with a holiday. On a positive note the staff in the hotel are wonderful and cannot do enough for you. However we were not advised that most things would be shut! The hotel is very dated especially the rooms and it is certainly not a 5 star property. We were not informed on booking our holiday or after we booked our holiday that nothing would be open, there was absolutely no evening entertainment so we literally went to bed at 9pm and there was a curfew from 9pm which is something we were not informed of. There was only 1 a la carte…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2021,2,Disappointed would be an understatement!,Me and my partner are currently here and to say we are disappointed would be a massive understatement. We would never have booked to come here if we knew just how much of the hotel was closed down along with all the other issues this hotel has. It's our tour operators fault as they never informed us and we are taking it up with them. Restrictions due to covid currently include... •No evening entertainment •Indoor pool is shut •Only one a la carte restaurant is open •No alcohol served in the hotel after 9pm •There is only one bar open in the lobby and one by the pool. The bar in the lobby shuts at 11pm •The snack bar by the pool is running on reduced hours Other issues we have experienced include... •WiFi not working properly •Safe not working •Very poor quality pre-mixed…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2021,5,Outstanding family break and great value,"The Riu Palace offers just about everything anyone could reasonably want for a relaxing family holiday, at a very reasonable price. We spent 11 nights on a package organised by TUI, in mid-August 2021 when Coronavirus precautions were in place. I’ll talk about the Coronavirus changes at the end as these will doubtless change over time. Some reviews start by talking about whether the hotel is “really” 5 star. I think it fully deserves the rating and I will explain why. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, with superb, powerful showers. The lobby and public areas are full of carvings and other local artwork. The facilities (large pool, spa, gym, bars, kids club etc.) are as you you’ll expect, and the gardens around the pool are both beautiful and well maintained. The rooms and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2021,4,August 2021 Holiday,"Firstly would like to start with saying all the potential concerns about travelling to Morroco do no way reflect the reality. Agadhir itself was being developed and is actually very up and coming. The hotel is beautiful and what you would expect from a 5* hotel. Amazing lobby, gorgeous pool area and nice rooms. Service of all the staff is outstanding. The main downside to this hotel is the food. It isn't bad tasting but very repetitive. Same food everyday and not any where close to 5*. 3*plus at best. Did two trips with tui, Agadhir Atlas mountain tour and camel ride. Both were amazing and I would recommend anyone to go on them. I would go bqck to the hotel how ever I would choose to eat out on an evening as there are many different types of restaurants near by.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2021,3,Read this before booking,"Stayed for one week. I will list the positives first then the negatives. Positives Design and decor of the place is lovely, one of the best I’ve seen. Idea for families, there are many different pool sections. Staff are very helpful. Negatives Top one is the food. It is dire for a 5 star. Simply a lack of variety. If you like your meats then avoid this place. Food is generally bland. On the last day my family all got stomach aches. Really wasn’t nice considering we were leaving on the day! The sea is quite dangerous. I had a moment where I needed assistance but the life guard was too busy talking to one of his friends. Luckily I had someone else help me. This might be an unfair comment to make as the life guard isn’t hired by the hotel, but I felt it needed to be…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

And were quite anxious but this hotel and specifically its amazing staff meant that we had a great time. From the first half hour we arrived from airport (roughly 11pm) we were greeted with such great service and a bite to eat which helped with 4 hungry kids. We met Issam who was so friendly and actually stayed helping us throughout our stay at dinner time. Genuinely best service we have had at any hotel restaurant. Being a family, of course we have a lot of boxes that need ticking. The most important factor that has helped make this a great holiday was the staff.

 May 2019,4,"Beautiful hotel, freezing pool",The hotel itself was stunning! It was clean and well presented throughout. The staff were amazing and were always happy to help. Our only one issue was that the pool with the swim up bar was freezing! The other pool was slightly heated but we chose this hotel as it had a swim up bar. We were only here for a few days so just relaxed. The beach was lovely and the sunsets were gorgeous.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2020,5,"Chilled, lovely hotel, nice food, not for party peeps","After receiving a couple of recommendations we thoroughly enjoyed a 9 night stay here in the beginning of March. The hotel looks lovely, we chose a shady pool view room. Room was nice annd big, decent wardrobe space for dresses etc. Lighting is an issue, esp for peeps trying to do their makeup. Shower was great, minibar all stocked with soft drinks. If you ask, they will leave you a couple of beers too. Its not a party hotel, more suited to people wanting to chill out and people more mature. However, we made friends and had a great time. Relaxing, just what we wanted. We were impressed with the food, for all inclusive its the best we have had. The krystal restrant wasnt as good as we had heard, avoid the rubbery lobster The Moroccon restaurant was delish!

 December 2019,3,"Fabulous Hotel & Location, staff etiquette questionable","My fifth time in Morocco and was recommended this hotel by friends with rave reviews, I have to agree the location is fantastic so close to the beach which is clean and never crowded. The pool area is so relaxing and plush, the bar is very well stocked and cocktails are top notch! I loved the extra touches given by the RIU ownership, the food is authentic Moroccan and well presented and the best I have had outside of Italy and France The staff although generally polite and very helpful do seem to be hell bent on finding a British bride, particularly if you are blonde,our party did complain to RIU as one of the managers uses the details we booked with to contact me, I have complained to RIU management, but this seems to have been ignored.

 March 2020,5,50th birthday,"My partner booked this holiday for my birthday, so glad he did we had a lovely week. Our room was spacious an spotless with balcony overlooking the tennis court. The staff really make this hotel from reception to the cleaner in the loo they are so polite and friendly, and dont think for one minute you can sit with an emtpy glass for very long. I was given champagne and cake for my birthday it was such a nice touch. We tried both the krystal restaurant and morrocan and can honestly say the morrocan was both our favourite. Our last day was a bit spoilt by the covid 19 so the hotel closed both pool bars and dinning room but the staff dealt with it very well. We have stayed at the riu palace in aruba and this is very much on par with it.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2020,4,Great place,"Having never been to Morocco before we decided to try it out. First of all we normally go for B&B but the prices we looked at in the canaries were more expensive than all inclusive here. We were not disappointed - the hotel, staff and food were wonderful. The room we had was very spacious although could do with more light in the bathroom, especially above the bath. The pool area was great, sunbeds always available but maybe that was the time of year! The pool was not too cold and the daily aqua gym was a good workout. The restaurant food was varied and you were never short of finding something for you. The gardens were well kept and a fantastic promenade to walk on just at the back of the hotel. We will not hesitate to come back here - whenever we're allowed!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2020,3,Feeling cheated,"This hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade. They can keep most of the staff especially Ashraf(restaurants) and Yousef(animation). They need more lighting in the reception area, dark furnishings in poor light equals accidents especially around the fountain. Biggest gripes are that the bar is seriously under stocked, a 5 star Hotel without a malt whiskey is poor to say the least, hardly an international drink in sight. Secondly, if you wish to eat on the terrace you need to either smoke or enjoy other people’s smoke with your food. A smoke free area by the pool would be another improvement. The rooms were clean and well proportioned, bed firm, plenty of pillows, hanging space too short for dresses, balcony never got the sun( if you want the sun you have to pay extra) no…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,5,Great time,"Just home from this hotel and all I can say is 5 stars are not enough. We have had many holidays and stayed in a good few RIU hotels this one tops the bill. I tried hard to find a negative thing to say but there was not one thing I could complain about. The food was good the staff are all great especially Brahmin and Redouine in the lobby bar, two great guys who made our stay extra special. Would I recommend this hotel without a doubt, would I go back most definitely.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 February 2020,4,Riu tikida palace agadir,"Excellent stay; great weather, great people. Drawbacks are the low cost flight and cramped seats. Next tine pay extra for reserved seat.

Friends stayed here and it seemed nice. We arrived late and only just managed to get food with 5 minutes to spare. So the pro’s: room was spacious and clean, we were in 1058 and the patio was sunny all day, and the garden area was quite private. All the spirits were branded ones. Plenty of choice at meal times. The location is great. Right on the prom which is a nice place to go for a walk. It is safe, no real hassle of sellers, say no thank you and they leave you alone. Pool area is pleasant and gardens are well maintained. There is a lovely tortoise who seemed to enjoy the company.......walked into our room one day and went for a nap behind…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,"Good food, Great location","My husband and I stayed at Riu Palace Tikida in Agadir during the last week of September. The Hotel was clean, the staff was friendly, professional and caring. As far as food is concerned, all that is shown in YouTube was available. I don’t know how it is in the summer month but, when we were there it was calm. There was no music during the day by the pool or in the lobby. They had live music at night in the lobby and special shows in their theater. Unfortunately, it ends around 10:30. The main issue we had was the lack of AC. Since they run a cool ventilated air type system. As a five-star all-inclusive hotel, they should have provided access to snacks after 10:00 pm. 75% of the guest were seniors. We still recommend the hotel especially for its safety, location and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,5,Returning guests,Having stayed in the RIU Palace last year we decided to return. The staff are amazing we were looked after every lunch time by Hassan El Bechraoui he was brilliant went out of his way to look after us. A lady called Hamam who was the chef Sector greeted us daily like we were old friends ensured we had a table and attended to our every needs. These are only two of the numerous staff that excelled themselves. The pool area along with the rest of the hotel is kept spotless however it is looking a little tired in places. Overall a brilliant stay and we will be returning again,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,5,Back Again,"Returned for our third visit and again cannot fault this hotel. Immaculate throughout, friendly,efficient service from everyone. Food and drink excellent, just love the morning coffees from the lobby bar. We will be returning very soon as we love this place one of the best Riu we have visited. It also says something when you return and the majority of the staff are still there and 😊",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2020,5,A fabulous hotel in a lovely location,"We enjoyed our weeks stay at the end of February. The hotel has a superb location right onto the promenade & beach, with it’s own private beach area. Lovely clean beach with walks either way, south the the Royal Palace & north to Agadir town & marina. Excellent choice & quality of food offering in the 4 restaurants, staff friendly on the whole and the hotel is very clean. It has many facilities, 3 pools including 1 indoor, spa, gym & evening entertainment if you want it. We had a large ground floor room overlooking the gardens & it was quiet with a large seating area, dressing room, separate from the bathroom. Weather was hot & sunny 24-33c We will certainly return!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2020,5,Beautiful,"Just love this place, it’s a magnet we come several times a year, the staff and the service are excellent, they go above and beyond.

 March 2020,3,NOT a 5 star hotel!!,We came home yesterday after a week stay here. I would like to start with the positive feedback- *Cleanness of the hotel was great the cleaners were very polite and go above and beyond to help!! *The hotel building it’s self is incredibly designed * The Kristal restaurant was great!! Food amazing as well as the staff in here!! *Reception were helpful when asked to move to a higher room as we had paid for a sea view and the first room we got was facing bushes. Negative feedback- * We found a lot of the staff to be very unhelpful !!! ( when we asked for a cappuccino at breakfast we were told where the bar was!!) I do not expect this from “ a 5 star hotel”) *The food in the main restaurants is extremely repetitive and pretty bland!! (I could not get a egg at…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2020,5,First Time NOT Last Time,"We were recommended this hotel by a friend. So glad we went with it as we were not disappointed. Hotel reception on arrival 11pm, food available for us and a welcome drink. Check in was fast and super efficient. Porter service so no dragging your case about. Restaurant, for all meals, couldn’t fault it, very attentive staff, absolutely spotless, and lots of food choices all freshly cooked, and restocked regularly. Our room, although a standard, it was huge, spotless and everything you need (apart from an iron). Cleaned everyday with fresh towels. Shower is amazing not just a drip, his and her sinks, private loo. Nothing broken either and this a hotel that is coming up for a refurb soon, but u wouldn’t think it. It’s very well maintained. Pool area, drinks, towels, plenty of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2020,3,Extremely varied,"Certainly not a 5 star hotel but lovely facilities and perfect weather Staff were very hit and miss, some were lovely and so friendly, a tip or 2 helps but there were a few who did not seem happy at all Food seemed amazing but I was one of several hit by a bug which lasted a couple of days. Half of the people we spoke with had same problem Lots of people stated the hotel is new or refurbished, it seemed quite tired I places with things needing a coat of paint and signs hanging off walls etc.. The speciality restaurants were a complete joke. It was a regimented act where the food choice was poor and quality lacking. Maybe we got unlucky but both visits ended early The service of our room seemed different to that of others, we had to request refills of loo paper and fresh…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,5,Amazing Hotel,Beautiful hotel on a beautiful beach front setting with the best food we have eaten. The first ground floor room we were given was not what we had paid for and was damp smelling but we complained and they moved us after 2 x nights to an amazing room (4138) which had a large balcony and pool and sea views. The promenade runs between the hotel pool and the private beach but it’s only a two minute stroll and not an issue. The beach is gorgeous and in February in the Atlantic Ocean we still managed to have a paddle. The two outside pools were colder than the Ocean. There was Aqua aerobics in the pool and by the time we got out our feet were numb. The Moroccan people are so friendly when you go out and about in she shops etc. They like to barter but are friendly with it if you…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,5,Mr Mike thompson,"Been to the palace six times best hotel ever.never been disappointed with the hotel,the staff,or the food .the hotel is so clean the gardens immaculate would recommend this to anyone who wants the best holiday ever the surrounding area is safe and the beach wonderful will be back there as soon as we can",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,3,Reasonable Winter Break,"I was more than satisfied with the short break at the Riu Palace. I know the Riu brand and the quality of service. No, it's definitely not 5* but that's merely a number anyway. With a predominantly French target market in Morocco, Riu cannot afford to let the food and wine quality slip. And they don't with the wine provided at lunch and dinner all being remarkably palatable. Food options in the main ""dining hall"" were varied and well presented. The dim lighting was a little frustrating particularly when trying to remove fish bones before eating. Yes, as said many times before, the staff are attentive and jovial. Tips appreciated but they don't hang around waiting for them, unlike many hotels. The outdoor areas are Riu Clean and orderly. The two outdoor pools were, in Feb, cold…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,3,Nice.. but could be better by far,"This is my last full day here and well this is my complete and honest review. Room 4005: Very big, beds are rock hard,mould in places of the celling,sealant around bathroom all brown and festering. Many sleepless nights due to grinding noise from hotel next door. You also hear the maid scrapping the chairs around the room at stupid o'clock in the morning so again dont think you'll get a lay in. Food: Some edible, fish every night..😑 desserts faultless. Fruit doesnt look the best pleasing. Two places to eat and very strick on dress code in main buffet so take trousers/Jean's. Fusion gestural- should call It tiny food. The service was very slow too 1 hour from arriving we still went served our starter. Was ready to eat the table cloth. Wouldnt recommend eating in the snack…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,3,Not 5 star!!,"This hotel needs a refurbishment urgently! Where do I start?!..... The rooms - falling apart, plug hanging out of the wall, front of bedside cabinet dropped off. Sofa which eats you when you sit on it! Ceiling light hanging off! Poolside- lovely warm pool but the pool area is dated, sun beds and lounge areas are very tired. No control by the pool area, lifeguards may as well not be present. Food- mediocre at best! All crockery is chipped which is very disappointing. Lobby/shows- who needs a show when the champions league is on- absolutely disgusting that they put no show on during the evening just because the football is on!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,5,Fantastic pkace,"Just returned 14th February and it was amazing. The rooms were really large we had 2211, the pools amazing and lots of sunbeds. Only one pool heated and was still a little cold for me but lots of people enjoyed the aqua fit. The animation team were so friendly making conversations with everyone. Can’t praise them enough, their evening shows were full of energy, well done. The nights when outside entertainment performed was a disappointment as there were lots of gaps between clothes changes. That was the only thing that Rui needed to improve on. The restraunt needs a little improving as replenishment was slow, I waited 15 minutes after asking for cheese that had run out, several times the dishes were empty and nobody kept a check on them. But that is something that can be…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,5,Fabulous week at this amaizing resort,"We had a absolutely wonderful time at the resort. The hotel itself is beautiful, the staff friendly and overall really nice. We spent most our days laying around the pool areas that great. The breakfast , lunch and dinner options were really extensive, with variety changing every day. Truly amaizing time. If I really have to dig for something to comment about, would be that the gym could use a bench to do proper weight training.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,4,RIU AGADIR VERY RELAXING,"Stayed here in Feb 20 and we could not fault the place . The staff , facilities and food were what we expected from a 4 star and the facilities around the pool during the day whilst we were relaxing met our expectations . The snack restaurant for lunch time was of a high standard along with the Buffett and the staff always on hand to refill your glass . We opt for a relaxing Moroccan Hammed scrub and massage within the spa and this was fantastic with the spa staff delightful. My only pick-up if I may was the gym equipment needs to be serviced as some are not functioning correctly (bicycles) and the opening times were not adhered to, we like to go at 8 o'clock in the mornings and the equipment was not switched on for use. A very nice hotel , great staff , fantastic food…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,4,Second Visit. Still Great,"In many years of travelling (not nearly enough of it reviewed), I've never felt the need to revisist a hotel until this one. The hotel itself is stunning and rooms are lovely but it's the staff who make it (in particular TikTok (Tariq), FuxkOff (Mohammed), Mo (entertainment), Khalid (bingo)). I generally avoid any hotel that has an ""animation team"" (because it's my idea of hell) but the team at this hotel actually made the holiday. We had some really good nights with these guys, from discussing the best ways to fish with TikTok and teaching Fuxkoff English to seeing Mo's shows and having Khalid entertaining us at the pool (we may have had a spectacularly lucky streak at bingo). The food was varied and plentiful, the housekeeping was second to none, the grounds are immaculate…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,5,Amazing!!,"I would highly recommend this hotel. From the minute we arrived we were looked after by the wonderful helpful and friendly hotel staff. We were greeted with a much needed welcome drink and then sent straight for food. The food is delicious and the huge selection of choice means you never get bored! As a family I can honestly say everything from the room to the food to the staff, to the beautiful pool, promenade and beach was perfect. We will definitely return to this hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2020,5,Perfect in every way,Best 5* star hotel I have experienced in Agadir. I seriously can not believe I never come across this hotel before I have traveled to Agadir 10+ times over the years and the only reason I didn’t come Across this hotel was because I was using booking dot com use rui official site for booking and don’t forget to become a member with RUI class for future discounts,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,4,Wonderful hotel,"This is a very fine hotel with the friendliest staff you could ever meet - they go the extra mile for you. The hotel has a splendid choice of food on its menus. The poolside and bar facilities are top class but the bedrooms, while very comfortable, would benefit from a make-over. Great location along the seafront.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,4,February holiday in the sun,Great hotel top quality food and service always plenty of space and loungers around the pool. Great access to the beach and this gave a ideal early morning walk as it's very flat and used by lots of people. If you want a winter sunshine holiday I can recommend this hotel and location (this is our fourth time here),Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2020,5,3rd Time and still lucky,"Returned home last night following another fantastic week at this hotel. We return every year and will continue to do so. Yes the hotel is getting a little worn at the edges and will soon be ready for refurbishment but it is immaculately clean at all times. The food is amazing, branded drinks, all in all a fantastic experience. However what really makes this hotel is the staff. They are so pleasant, happy. Go the extra mile etc. Some staff even remembered us and made an extra special effort. Managers walk the floor and talk to you. Great customer service May I ask that, should you visit, theres a young lady who spends all day cleaning the toilets by the pool. They are spotless. Please remember like we did to give her a tip. Most people just walk past. She deserves it",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,"Take loose clothes, you'll need them after a week of eating here!","This hotel has been by far the best service and food I have ever recieved in a hotel. The staff are all friendly, good at their jobs, seem to actually enjoy doing their job. The food is so delicious, we ate until we felt sick every day, we wanted to taste everything. There was not a single day we felt dissapointed by anything! The beach is a short walk, there are plenty of swimming pools to choose from and the city itself is just worth visiting. We loved it!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2020,3,Lovely hotel but .......,"We’ve been here for 11 days, this is our second visit, this is our last full day in the hotel. The buildings within the hotel complex are beautiful, the rooms are spacious and well thought out in design, the staff are friendly, the weather is amazing, the sun beds are great and plentiful. All the Ingredients for a great winter in the sun holiday. So why the ‘but’? That comes in the lack of attention to the details that would give the hotel 5 stars. Details like : The towels with holes in them The really uncomfortably hard beds and pillows The poor WiFi particularly in the bedrooms The strange missing items at breakfast - no cups, no teaspoons, no teabags, no fruit- all missing randomly every morning, and tables left uncleared while guests search for somewhere to sit and eat…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2020,4,Dependable,"My wife and I have now made 5 visits to the Riu Tikida Palace over about 8 years. We always visit in January as an alternative to Tenerife. It is a touch cooler than Tenerife, especially in the mornings, but overall the weather is glorious. The rooms are enormous, the entire hotel is kept spotlessly clean by an army of staff who are all smiling, friendly and happy to chat. The food is dependably good with an enormous amount of choice, but the joints on the chef's carving station are generally overcooked for our liking (pork turkey, duck), . The restaurants, are however, very busy and crowded, especially the pool restaurant used for lunch. The food and service in the specialist French and Moroccan restaurants are on another level entirely. Superb. Make sure to take advantage of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2020,4,"Great Hotel, BUT....","We are currently at Riu palace Agadir and are having a great time. They gave us the room of our choice and promptly fixed an issue with the safe- very professional service. All the Riu staff we have met are polite, friendly and professional, ensuring that we have a pleasant stay. The food and drinks on offer are also very good and Riu provides a generous all inclusive service. We travel at least three times a year to various parts of the world, including Caribbean , Indian Ocean, Asia and more and can honestly say that the standard of food and service here is really good. Moving to the but- unfortunately, not everyone provided the level of service expected.

 January 2020,5,Remains magnificent,"3 year on the trot at this great hotel in January for us, once again using it it as a base for golf. Everything was the same high standard, all the food, wine, cleanliness, and the staff, who really make this place so special. Redouane, the waiter who has looked after us for the last few years is a credit to the hotel and is a part of why we keep coming back. Agadir's golf courses, including the fantastic Tazegzout which overlooks the Atlantic, are all top class, and so easy to access with the hotel's linked coach service. Looking forward to next year already",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2020,5,My fave hotel,"Definitely the best hotel I have stayed in. All the staff work incredibly hard to make your stay great & with smiles applenty. The hotel has all the facilities you could wish for, with food & drink available 24 hours should you so wish.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2020,5,Fabulous time,"Have just returned from another great week at this hotel. Loved it. Sadly we were unfortunate enough to experience the Agadir winds. These did not ruin the holiday. Our only downside were the very very Rude French, I know us Brits do not have the best reputation abroad, but I have never experienced such rudeness, to Staff and other guests alike, they really do not care who they upset!!. Other than that, we had a great time, special thanks to Issam our Cocktail man, even doing a lovely job on a Porn Star Martini. We will definitely be going back.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,4,Good but not excellent. Some updating needs to happen.,"The hotel is lovely but January is the wrong time to come if you want sun. It’s very cold in a morning and on a night. It’s warm about lunchtime for 4/5 hours so if you want a sun holiday wrong time to come if you’re a sun worshipper. The only part that lets it down is the kids club. It needs a massive refurbishment. Floors are falling apart, cracked glass in the play area and a lot of toys need replacing and updating as they were well used. I never left my daughter there either as at 4 years old she would just wander off and the gate was hanging off the post. As lovely as the staff were in the kids club, there was only one on sometimes so I didn’t feel safe leaving her there without myself or husband being there. Food was plentiful in the restaurant and snack bar. Lots of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I can honestly say that not only was this one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, but also one of the best New Years we have ever had. There is not one single thing not to like here. The food is excellent, champagne with lobster on New years eve, exceptional dining experiences in the Krystal restaurant etc etc. The staff are probably fed happy pills all through the hotel as we always met with a smile from everybody.

 January 2020,3,William,"We visited this hotel for 2 weeks starting Boxing day 2019. Generally the hotel was very good, staff,facilities and cleanliness. Two points,however completely spoiled the holiday. First the lunch time snack restaurant, the majority of the time it was like a cattle market, chairs and tables being dragged all over the place, resulting in poor service and general chaos and finally a £110 extortate charge to keep the room on for 5 hours (my wife being partially disabled).",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The maids provide clean towels and there's always plenty of hot water. We had a problem with one of the rooms towards the end of our holiday but this was dealt with quickly once management were made aware, they also went above & beyond to resolve the issue and we thank them for that.

 December 2019,5,Literally heaven,"I don't even know how to describe my trip to Morocco Agadir, me and my friends were really turned by this hotel, it's more than words can explain, the service was great and the location is awesome, the stuff are really friendly and easy going, the animation team was very good and because of them we barely got out of the hotel , I definitely recommend this hotel",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,2,Not a 5 star hotel,"I have visited Agadir on a number of occasions and it is a beautiful city with friendly people. This is not my first stay in this hotel. The location is good, right by the beach and a reasonably short walk to the marina. But the hotel standards have slipped and I would no longer class this as a 5 star hotel. The entertainment was very poor for a hotel of this size and brand. However, I cannot fault the animation team who were always friendly helpful and smiling but they can only work with what they are given. The weather was not the best during my last visit and there were no activities during the day, unless you like bingo, so the only options were to sit in the room or bar. The evening shows were performed by the animation team who had already been working all day. I feel…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2020,4,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, food & drinks average","Lovely clean and well maintained hotel. pool, beach and room facilities 10/10. food although lots of choice was often cold and limited choice for vegetarians (not always labelled well). draft beer wasnt too great and soft drinks often flat. Free wifi throughout whole of hotel, mini bar stocked up daily and room cleaned to a high standard daily. You can also visit the al-a-carte restaurants as often as you like. Moroccan and international but you need to book 1 day in advance. Around 25 mins in taxi from airport, local orange taxis outside hotel only accept 3 passengers so need 2 taxis or a extra large taxi for 3+ people. 25/30 dirhims to the marina (£2-2.50) where there is a lot of coffee shops, dessert shops & up market restaurants (pure passion was lovely). most…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2019,5,It gets better with every visit!,"Just arrived home from another amazing stay at the RIU Palace Tikida Agadir. We are repeat guests of this wonderful hotel and it gets better with every visit. Our stay this year was during Christmas and New Year. The hotel was decorated beautifully. The food at the Gala dinners on both Christmas and New Year’s eve was wonderful. We were torn between wanting to eat everything and not wanting to spoil the beautiful displays of food! Huge thanks to Chef and his team for such an amazing effort. All the hotel staff were as friendly, helpful and efficient as always. They all seemed to be genuinely pleased to see us, remembering us from previous visits and welcoming us back like old friends. The more we visit this hotel, the more we feel it’s a home from home. The senior managers…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,3,Not The Same,"We have stayed at the hotel several times, most recently in October 2019. We were thinking of booking again, however we are reluctant after reading recent reviews. Whilst the pool and bar service remained excellent, we thought that the quality of food and service in the restaurant had dropped last time compared to previous visits which was a concern to us. And to now see that some members of the animation team have left is very disappointing. The animation team worked extremely hard, especially Tab, they made you feel very welcome and indeed remembered returning guests. It is very sad that the hard work of all the staff is not recognised by the hotel management.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2020,2,What happens there?,"I stayed there again for a business trip to Agadir. Sadly I must see that many staff I know and appreciate is not working there anymore. The Animation team and also the bar. I miss my friend Yassine, he was always my highlight of the evening when he serve me my drinks with a smile and his cute German. I was really sorry to hear that he quite his job because of problems with his supervisor or manager. For me the lost of good staff is a signal of mismanagement and also a lack of payment. Hopefully the manager knows what to do. If i read the latest reviews I am a little concerned about and hope the best. I will see if I will stay again or maybe follow the lost staff to another hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,4,Still good but standards seem to be slipping,"Another visit to the best Hotel (IMHO) in Agadir however I felt that it was not up to its usual high standard. Greeted with a drink at reception and was quite surprised that our rooms weren't ready, ok, it was a little before three but I would have expected to have been given some keys, not exactly early morning. So the bedroom, problem one, you couldn't open the mini fridge door as it caught on the wardrobe runners so you had to lift the fridge up everytime you wanted to get something out. The fridge is restocked by hotel staff every day so you would have thought that it would have been attended to but obviously not. Anyway, sorted by placing a couple of empty milk cartons underneath it. Lasted the week....just! Problem two, you could not open the drawers underneath the safe…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,4,Management,"😱🙁 Well where do I start this hotel has lost alot of faith in staff members who will be deeply missed because of the way management treat the staff. Especially الهبظي he has no respect for the fantastic animation team who go above and beyond to make sure holidaymakers have a pleasant and enjoyable stay. The staff work all hours god send and treat shocking for as little 3,000 dirhams a month. (No wonder holiday makers have to give the staff tips to help them through the month) The animation manager was not seen once during our stay not even to tell him how fab his team was or to make sure they were OK, which does not give the staff morale or respect nobody knows this disrespectful manager. Unfortunately this has lead to 3 members of staff leave the hotel goodbye and all…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,1,Disappointing Animation Team Management,"The Animation team are PHENOMENAL, and absolutely made our family trip a memorable one. Every night the entertainment was varied with high energy and brilliant chorography. Our kids loved hanging out with the Animation team all day. Notably, TapTap was an all-round superstar. 5* to you TapTap! But the Management of the Animation team were bitterly disappointing. The way they treated the team was unprofessional, especially within earshot of guests. I think the boss was called Mr Hibdee; he completely dampens the high energy of the Animation team. Separately, considering the scale of the operation, the food is delicious, and the drink offer is fairly comprehensive. A good chilled out getaway, but it is just a shame some members of management were so disconnected from the guests…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,3,Disappointed,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times and always found it excellent. Staff are very welcoming and friendly. However I was very disappointed with with entertainment this time. Apparently some of the animation team had left. Every time we've visited over the last few years Tab Tab has been there and he was the heart and soul of the team, to have let him go is a great loss to the hotel",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,5,6th Stay in 6 years!,"This was our 6th visit to the RIU Palace Tikida Agadir, in as many years. We have always promised ourselves a stay over Christmas and New Year… this was our year! As we wanted to stay for both Christmas and New Year’s Eve, we decided to stay for 10 nights (previously having stayed for a week at a time). In-line with European countries the main Christmas celebration is held on Christmas Eve. The hotel holds a Gala Buffet dinner in the main restaurant on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. The food at both Gala dinners was fantastic! So much choice, every taste catered for. So many beautiful butter and fruit sculptures decorating the restaurant. It really was a spectacular sight… the starters were almost too pretty to eat! Even though the hotel was running at full occupancy,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,5,Excellent holiday location,"I visited this resort with my husband and grown up son in October 2019. Check in was straightforward and check in staff were pleasant and informative. Our room was a good size and contained a king size bed in the main area of the room and a single bed in the area next to the balcony. The bathroom had a bath with a shower over, although this was not quite high enough for my son who is 6' 4"" tall. There was a double sink and a toilet and bidet in a separate room off of the bathroom. All facilities were clean and well kept. There was a mini fridge that was replenished every two days. Cards for pool towels were provided at check-in and could be exchanged at the animation station as often as required. The two pools looked great although the one with the swim up bar was colder…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,4,Good but not great,"We stayed at this hotel for Christmas 2 years ago and everything was excellent so we had no hesitation in booking for the same period this year. The hotel is still beautiful, staff always attentive, good choice of food & drink, clean rooms and public areas. This year the entertainment was seriously lacking, no presence of the animation team as per our previous stay, really disappointing. Christmas Eve the show was dreadful, dancers who weren’t in time, no smiles and zero effort, nothing made you feel Christmassy. Moroccan night was horrendous three women who seriously looked like they wanted to be somewhere else. One night the man on stage was actually watching the football game whilst performing. Children also running around on stage in between acts with no manager or…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,4,Lovely hotel in general.,"I stayed here in November. The hotel itself is a good standard and very nicely decorated. The gardens and poolside especially are lovely. Food I found for a buffet all inclusive type place to be very nice, no dodgy tummy and a mixture of european and Moroccan. You could order bombay sapphire/gordons, grants and jack daniels, but you have to specifically ask for it by brand name. cocktails are fine, pretty standard stuff for all inclusive. Kettles and soft drinks in rooms. Bathrooms I found great and cleaning staff are superb. All round very nice and well managed. Downsides, no chance of a lie in, cleaners moving beds around you and the sound bounces round the walls. This is a bit annoying. Entertainment at night is a bit slow, I enjoyed a drink in the lovely bar, but guests…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2019,4,Enjoyed but a few shortfalls...,"I arrived at this hotel on 23rd December with my brother and sister in law and spent a week here and thoroughly enjoyed it. We received a welcome drink and a warm welcome. Check in was swift. I thought the hotel was lovely, very tasteful with spacious rooms - mine was spotlessly clean. I did have a fault with my electrics but it was quickly remedied. I found the staff extremely pleasant and friendly. Lovely restaurant for breakfast and dinner. My sister in law requires Gluten free food and was really impressed with the choice of food she could have. Yes, sometimes the food is warm rather than piping hot but I have experienced that in every hotel I have ever stayed in. However, I thought the variety of food was very good.

 December 2019,5,Perfect pre-Christmas holiday,"Parents and adult sons with their cousin having a pre-Christmas vacation in Tikida Agadir was a perfect choice.

We first checked in and our key was not authorised, then the telephone did not work and lastly the toilet was blocked and Yousif was not overly bothered but eventually after 3 trips to reception was resolved. Ask Ilham for advice and she will fob you off and she will tel you there is nothing to do in Agadir. Food is always the same with the odd dish changed and snack bar is the left overs from lunch.

We always rated this Hotel as very good with very good dining and recommended it it many friends - so we were very surprised indeed this year to find how much standards have slipped. We found the visit very disappointing and necessary to write this review from a point of view as a couple who has been here 5 times and able to compare - the quality of the food has dropped considerably just one point on the overall quality of the food served which was what we did not expect. At the Christmas Eve meal I has dirty cutlery on the table literally with food on it which was replaced immediately but it should not have been there in the first place.

Rooms are spacious and cleaned up to high standards daily. There are enough sunbeds, even when you arrive in the afternoon pool boys always makes sure they will bring you sunbed as there are more sunbeds than guests. Management is always visible and approachable to sort out any concerns you might have. For Christmas and New Year hotel organizes GALA DINNER , but you need to prebook your table for the seating you wish to have. There is Riuland for children from age 4-12 open in the morning and in the afternoon and mini disco in the evening. Heated swimming pool outside and inside.

 December 2019,5,Winter Holiday,"Been to this hotel now 4 times, due to the quality of service, facilities, food and value for money paid. Hard to beat.

Now the beach areas are quite clean from the usual trash.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,1,Ineffective Management,We stayed for ten nights. Food quality and choice is excellent. Food is available from early morning until 10pm. After that a buffet is available for late arrivals. Soundproofing is an issue in the rooms. We had an issue with an alarm sounding. Other faults were repaired straight away by management but nobody was prepared to speak to guests who had an alarm sounding from 0350 to 0609. Carlos [--] the assistant general manager avoided speaking with us about this until day four and was too frightened to raise it with the guests concerned. His lack of effective management mentioned in other comments is noted. The reception manager Abdul was however of much stronger personality and did speak with the guests who apologised and turned it off. Waiter service outside was abysmal.…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2019,1,Complete Let Down,"Having endured 9 long days here, escape is now finally in sight tomorrow. By the way, if you choose this at very best low 4* rated hotel, be mindful the walls are paper thin & ceiling mouldy. Our shelf was broke & no light in bathroom. Not a very welcome arribal. But after 2 nights of no sleep on arrival, a member of staff stood in our bedroom at 6.08am (yes you read it right) on the 3rd day. Carlos the assistant manager hiding away in his ivory tower, took day 4 to actually talk to us. 2 days of over an hour standing there, waiting to see him on one occasion as he was talking to his chef (obvs customer service is a lower priority to him).

 November 2019,3,"A Shame, could be fantastic.","I'm sorry to have to write a mediocre assessment of this hotel, but it just don't work. This is nothing to do with the hotel itself, its very good, never a lack of hot water, good facilities, comfy large room, spotlessly clean. However the food is at best just about edible, considering a large number of the guests are French, I found this a surprise. Also the quality of the alcohol available, not good except in restaurant, beer ok, wine just about drinkable. The staff in general are very good, but service goes up no end if you start tipping ( 20 dirams, about £1.60 does it ). We ate out 3 times, pushing the price of our holiday up quite a bit, as its English prices outside and taxis are dearer than London. Its a pity, as could be exceptional.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2019,4,Not great weather in sept - not a lot to do around,"Seeing this title you may think this is a negative review, however it isn’t. This hotel can’t control the sea mist so this is nothing to do with them. The staff were great and the hotel was clean. We paid extra for a better room and it was good. Unfortunately me and my girlfriend like to go out and eat etc, there’s wasn’t many nice restaurants around. The hotel food was okay, we are vegan and there was a fair few options, but for 2 weeks, as were foodies, there wasn’t enough. Overall I have mixed feelings about Agadir, I will not be returning. Due to the great staff and hotel being nice, it gets 4* from me, but then again I wouldn’t return.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

They all genuinely want to help. We will definitely return. AI was no exactly that with sunbed service or where ever you wanted it service. If you wanted to.. you could drink champagne 24 hours a day!! Lamb tagine!! OMG... Many thanks to all the great staff. A couple of tiny observations. 1. Decafe tea could be nice as an option. 2.

Special thanks to all especially Imad who looked after us by the pool. A personal thanks to Issam and Sumaya who looked after us in the main bar of an evening. They are both very professional and deserve to be recognised for their abilities. The speciality restaurants are amazing and it is surprising how many guests do not try them definitely worth a visit.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 October 2019,3,not good,"The hotel was good until we were not happy in the last few days. We made a small complaint to the staff which easily could have been resolved. We asked to speak to the head chef (Rashid) and manager (Carlos) but they didn't show up and we waited for at least an hour. We asked again at the reception and was told they left half hour ago to go home. For two days the matter was not getting resolved. We got annoyed and hence my daughter then wrote a review as she was annoyed with the service. So the next morning, we asked to speak to them and still they didn't come see us after we waited at the reception for over an hour. All we wanted is just to not have burnt food and improvement on service, then we would of been happy if the matter was resolved. We were happy at the end as the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

My little kid loved the mini playground maybe need to expand that a bit more. Good entertainment, good choice of food and the two restaurants are great. The spa I will highly recommend I really enjoyed my traditional Hamam. Didn’t like the fact we had to pay extra for late checkout normally other hotels extend that. On the last day couple of staff were a bit unhelpful like it’s a chore to get a high chair or serve tea. Also on leaving the porter decided he will call us a taxi. The taxi cost to the airport as advised by all staff at the front desk is 220dh but he along with the driver decided they will bump up the price to 250dh.

 October 2019,5,A wonderful stay with my family,This was our first trip to Morocco and after some research on tripadvisor we opted for the Tikida Palace as we had stayed at Riu hotels previously and were always very impressed with the quality. First off the staff make this hotel as they are extremely friendly and attentive without being over the top. We were on holiday with our two children and my parents so we had two rooms next to each other both of which were facing the sea. The food was excellent and varied at all times and this was for all sittings in both the main restaurants and the Moroccan themed one. The evening entertainment (animation) was really good and for Mon - Fri this was performed by the staff and at the weekends they brought in external people. The pools were clean with lots going on and the swim up bar…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 November 2019,5,So glad we decided to return.,"We decided on this hotel, having stayed previously a couple of years ago. We were slightly apprehensive that standards may have slipped, or that the hotel may have been starting to get a bit run down and shabby, but we needn't have been! This is a truly relaxing hotel, the pool area is huge, and the hotel is right on the beach promenade, allowing you to go out for a stroll along the sea front. The staff are fab, really friendly, professional and helpful; One staff member really stood out to us, and that was Nora in the main restaurant, a real superstar! The room was perfect, a decent size and a huge bathroom. The housekeeping team came in daily and kept the room really clean. The food... Well what can I say; it really did make our holiday.

 November 2019,4,A nice stay,"Had 7 nights here, overall really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were a good size, didn't contain any dressing robes or slippers though and lacked toiletries. But was cleaned well and comfy beds. Pools were beautiful and loads of sunbeds, service was fast and brilliant. All staff were polite, my downsides are the hotel is very dark at all times, which to me is a hit of a downer and also, not much goes on entertainment wise. Young couple and didn't find much to do there on an evening. Food was generally good, not outstanding but nice all the same, enjoyed to stay. But don't feel a pull to come back",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,5,Fantastic holiday,Arrived here after spending a few days in Marrakesh. From the moment we stepped into the foyer we felt welcomed and looked forward to our stay. The room was spacious and very clean. There was plenty of sun beds available in the outside area too. A great selection of food in the various eateries and we personally enjoyed being seated and the drink service in some of the restaurants. The Krystal restaurant experience was super. Loved the usual activities available. Only criticism is the lack of something to do in the evening - not everybody wants to watch or listen to others providing “entertainment”. Get people up and moving. Saying this it is not enough reason for us not to think about coming back in the future.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,5,All inclusive,"We arrived at the airport in Agadir and were immediately directed to the TUI stand where we were given a welcome pack and directed to the coach’s. This was all done politely and efficiently. Air con coach trip to the hotel short and pleasant. We arrived at the palace tikida and immediately loved the space, beautiful entrance area and reception. Again polite and efficient staff welcomed us and off to our room we went, this was double with balcony very nice clean and spacious room. Nice space for clothes, bath and shower, separate toilet and bidet, his and hers vanity top. Space to relax separate from the bed area with table chairs and settee. Balcony overlooking pool and beach. All the food we had was well prepared and plentiful. Did not try the two restaurants as they had only…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,4,Loved this place,"Spent a lovely week here. So very relaxing, and what a great bunch of staff. Have to say that the food here is superb and definitely something for everyone. This has been so far the best TUI holiday in the category of desserts, inns many restaurants for all inclusive the desserts look great but lack flavour, here is the opposite- I loved the desserts here they all had flavour, not a bit of “bland” in sight, Staff were great, and hats off to the bar staff who remember what you had, there are loads of people to remember. Also just because a cocktail you like is not on the menu does not mean they will not make it for you, so always ask I have to say that we visited the speciality restaurants Marrakesh and Krystal, we liked Krystal the bes5 and returned a few nights later.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 November 2019,3,Falls short for a 5*,"We stayed here for a week in Mid November. On arrival the hotel is lovely. The public area with reception, lounge, bar, shop and live music area are all open plan. The lighting is dingy and it’s impossible to read a book in there (paper white kindle is ok though). The ambience in this area is nice though but it really should be better lighting. The rooms are quite nice but a little tired and attention to detail is lacking by housekeeping and maintenance seem to overlook things (sink emptying slowly, curtain hooks missing, spare blankets in wardrobe not clean, settee in room quite smelly to name a few). All in all quite comfy though and a decent amount of storage. We were initially on the 2nd floor but after 2 nights there was a problem with Ants. We drew the line at finding…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 November 2019,5,Return visit,"11-22nd November 2019 HOTEL SPA I don't have much to add from my first review of last year plus other peoples comments. However, on this visit we tried the hotel spa for a 1.30hr Hammam. My understanding is that its a franchise and has nothing to do with the hotel but what they offered i dont think is value for money. The Tui reps will offer you 10 minutes extra time and a discount on some of the treatments. We both went for the Hammam - 500 dirham (£40). I realise that a spa is a place of relaxation and we always have a massage when on holiday, but this is how it went... 1. Arrived early for a 10am appointment. By the time we changed and then asked to take a seat it was 1010 before we were taken to steam room to spend 10 minutes to relax - felt longer. 2. After that we had…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,5,A peaceful week in the African Sun,"Riu Hotels can not be beaten on any thing. So that this does not end up a long winded series of statements praising every thing and everyone in the hotel, I will just say this. If you want to choose a hotel chain to visit just about any where, Choose RIU. They are Excellent every where, Staff are professional friendly and helpful, The facilities from the rooms, pools indoor sports and fitness areas are immaculate, the Bars and Restaurants have a fantastic range of good wholesome food and drinks. Basically just brilliant.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,5,Tanfastic Tikida Palace for a winter sunshine break,Recommended by friends for a winter sunshine break and certainly lived up to expectations with luxurious decor fabulous food and drink.Staff attentive especially if given praise and thanks for good service but interesting to see their response to rude demanding guests who were treated accordingly. Only mistake we made was to book for end of October departure which coincided with school half term so hotel very busy for first week of our stay.Extensive well tended gardens still allowed peace and quiet on the many raised platforms/ gazebos around the large pool area. A couple of days of sea frets at the start of holiday when cool and misty and could have been at Scarborough on East coast of Yorkshire.

 October 2019,5,7 th Visit,"Just returned from our 7h visit here. On check in delighted to learn we had been upgraded to a sea view suite. We had 2 weeks of beautiful weather, one morning was slightly misty but it soon cleared. The restaurants serve a good well varied choice of foods. We like to eat out on the terrace and had no trouble getting a table outside here every day. A big thank you to Redouan and his team for looking after us so well. In fact all members of staff in every department go out of their way to make sure everything is as you want it. The one thing we like about Riu hotels is that you can clearly see management around and any little problem is promptly sorted. Looking forward to returning next year.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 November 2019,5,Winter getaway,"Firstly thank you to all of the amazing staff at the hotel. Me and my wife arrived to a hassle free check in and then a walk on the beach which was a perfect start. I must say this hotel is faultless the rooms are clean spacious and comfortable, the food is some of the best I've ever had, the heated pool was amazing and the animation team kept us entertained all day with different activities. I also got to watch the footie in the hotel and was waited on throughout. I cant recommend enough and will definitely return. Thanks again to all the staff and management",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 November 2019,5,One of the best we’ve ever stayed in!,"Just heading home from a weeks stay in the truly amazing RIU Tikida Palace. It’s been such a wonderful experience ... literally from start to finish. From the moment of booking I received a 10% discount for our entire stay as I booked through a birthday email from the RIU class company. Totally worth while signing up if you use RIUs all over the world. The room we were allocated was a beautiful pool view, even being on the ground floor it made the access to the pool so much easier - would highly recommended for families for ease. The room is spacious and has everything you need including a small mini bar in the little fridge. The room is fully cleaned each day with new towels and fresh linen (in cute displays).

Rooms are big nice balcony mini bar stocked daily room cleaned to a high standard. Pool area is big with plenty of sunloungers. If you are nice to the staff they are nice to you and look after you for your stay!

 November 2019,4,Could be better,"Just returned from a week break in the palace and building work is still on going also remedial work on collapsing foot path , It’s a fantastic hotel but to get it to be where it needs to be in my mind it will take a year to pull it all together. Drainage smell in the main toilet and the restaurant stops making food at least 1/2 hour before closing also can not keep up with demand . At present it has to be the best value for money for an hotel of this quality.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,5,Spectacular,"My boyfriend and stayed at the hotel on our first holiday together and we had an absolutely fantastic time. The hotel is exceptional and has the definite wow factor. We stated in room 1142 and we had stunning views of the pool and beach. Staff were lovely and very attentive, especially some of the bar and restaurant staff. I would certainly recommend the palace and would love to re-visit again. Thank you to all the staff for an amazing holiday experience.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,5,Good location,"We stayed here for eight nights on rather second half of a multi centre holiday. Upon arrival we were quickly signed in and told to look around and a porter we take our bags to our rooms. Hotel reception was large and clean. After going to have a drink we went to our room. We walked into the bed room with a large bed and tv. Down two steps was a sofa and two chairs that led to the balcony which had sitting and a table. On the other side was a lots of wardrobe space, a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities. In the wardrobe there wasn’t enough hangers but after speaking to reception this was quickly rectified. Also the mini bar in the fridge(soft drinks) wasn’t filled but reception also rectified this. The bath room was large with a door to the toilet and a bath with a over…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,5,Excellent late break,"Our first visit to a Riu Hotel - could not fault the cuisine (Moroccan influence) - Hotel very impressive grounds and we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly at all times. Yes occasional tipping did no harm but not every time a member of staff did something, as some people seemed to do. We saved most of our tipping to regular members of staff who looked after us, not only in the restaurants.Excellent room located on main floor - easy access to all facilities. Evening entertainment could have been a little more professional at times, however we chose what we wanted to see. Access to very clean beach with private area almost immediate from hotel grounds.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2019,2,This is not a five star hotel,"The first thing to know about the Tikida Palace is that it's not really a 5-star hotel.  This hotel does not belong in the same category as the Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, or the Bellagio. Before arriving I did not think too carefully about the fact that it is all-inclusive, but after arriving you can see the impact of this right away.  The beer, wine, and other alcohol is all low quality.  The buffet (which is the default option for every meal) has many available items, however none of them seems to shine.  For 50 dirhams ($5) outside of the hotel you can easily find a much better tagine or couscous.  The sushi is what you will find at a grocery store.  The juice is flavorless and so pulpy it's like a soup. There are two other restaurant options in the hotel, one…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is amazing with the most wonderful, friendly, smiley staff who literally can't do enough to ensure your drinks are filled, your sunbed is facing the right way and that your stay is the best you can have. The food is AMAZING. We've had shrimp the size of your dinner plate, tagines where the meat melts, puddings that are sublime and all served with a 'hello' and a smile. The hotel room is large with enough storage space and a free safe. The ""mini bar' is topped up regularly with water and soft drinks and there are tea and coffee with a kettle in the room.

Promenade and beach behind hotel were so easy to access. We weren’t hassled very much either. Staff at the hotel always smiling and helped whenever you needed a question answering. Entertainment was a bit hit and miss, but it was ok. We liked the music played by the bar in the reception area in the evening, lovely mix of old and new music but nothing too heavy, people got up for a dance when they heard something they liked.

As soon as we finished we went back to reception and we where handed our room key and pointed in the direction of the lifts. Just a little note - reception is on floor 3 ! this did confuse us at first as we went to our room on the 4th floor, then we were meeting some friends in the bar and we went down to floor 1 ! where the pool is.

Bars always fully stocked with what our hearts desired and with a cheerful smile from bar and waiting staff. Main restaurant lovely, great selection of food for all tastes, never rushed. Brahim a truly great guy, nothing too much trouble. Krystal restaurant this visit did disappoint us a little, the food was excellent even though the menu was the same as last October.

 October 2019,5,Excellent October Holiday,"We had a wonderful week at the resort. Our family of 6 stayed in two rooms on the 4th floor. As mentioned in other reviews, the mattresses are hard as rocks. Both of our rooms (4123, 4119) had a view of the Sea from the balcony. However we hardly saw it because we were never in our room. Our days looked something like this: Breakfast in the buffet. The wait staff at breakfast need a little training as drinks were very slow and they seemed annoyed when we asked for more water. But the food was excellent and no one left hungry. My kids especially enjoyed the fresh made donuts. From there we would go to the pool area (make note to reserve your cabana before breakfast or you won't get one). Pool bars open at 10 and they serve specialty coffees which are good.

 June 2019,4,Lovely hotel. Service let’s it down,This must be one of the grandest hotels in agadir location good. But if a nightmare for pool loungers and staff do take your umbrella if it’s not up. Bar service very poor unless you tip them. They blatantly ignore you if others are tippers. Worst is lobby bar. No waiter service for drinks only when hotel owner is there on site then you get asked if you want a drink every few minutes. The boss needs to know that there is no service when he is absent.

(We took our 5 mth old baby and was unable to take her in either pool) which was a shame. The cocktails could do with improving and the evening entertainment was very, very basic.

Throughout the stay the food has been lovely, very tasty, lots of choice and it's the first all inclusive that actually has nice deserts!!!

Wow this hotel does show off it’s five star ness however it lacks in the small details which truly make a hotel five stars. The reception staff, we believe, need more training on customer services, the remaining staff around the hotel are truly five star and they just cannot do enough for you, the visitor, client or whatever you title yourself - the tourist.

If you would like to eat in a 5 star hotel burnt food then this is the best hotel to come for burnt food in the world. Been to so many countries and never had a problem. We asked the chef to make up a pizza with our choice of toppings, but was burnt. Again we asked for the pizza and garlic bread to be made again which was also burnt. Next day we went to have a look at the pizzas that they made and was all burnt. We complained today and the waiters told them to quickly get rid of the food before the manager comes.

The food is amazing and the best I've ever had in an AI and I've stayed in a few other 5* hotels. The desserts are sublime.

 October 2019,1,The beds were so hard we could not sleep!,I’ve given loads of lovely reviews to the many fantastic hotels we have stayed in- this is a difficult hotel. The beds are so hard it’s like sleeping on the floor?? And then at 9am every morning the noise starts- furniture above your room being pulled and thrown around. The food is borderline terrible- I knew it wasn’t going to be great but it was way worse than I feared! The krystal and marrakech restaurants are a complete joke- you are better off eating in the canteen- with the lukewarm food. So as you can imagine - we are in an all inclusive hotel and we can hardly eat or sleep. We are literally still here with 2 days to go and all we want is nice food and our lovely bed. We have spoken to reception but they are very dismissive. I just don’t want any other couples to…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

With the hotel being run under the guidance of the Director General Nader Ghosheh and his two Directors Adjoint Carlos J. Garcia and Khalil N Iaaza, this must be the flagship for Riu in Morocco, The hotel is run to a very high standard and must be a credit to the Riu Group. It was great to be able to dine on the terrace for evening meals which was run by Rid Wass and his team Hamza and Sara as well as other staff . This area is run like clockwork and you would think it was Rid Wass own business. A pleasure to be served by him and his staff.

Due to mobility problems we had asked for a room with a walk in shower and this they did for us although they have very few of them. Hotel wise the shower was really our only complaint about our stay as the drain kept blocking and flooding the bathroom, we had the maintenance out 7 times.

So will start with the restaurants we really enjoyed both al la carte, both food and ambiance. The buffet in the main hotel was ok apart from the tables being so close together , it was like having dinner with another couple you didn’t know. It was fine if you either had a bit of a conversation with each other or they were speaking to each other but a few people sat there not speaking to each other and felt like they were just listening to us which felt rather odd. Buffet beach front was much better, plus they change this to a Italian restaurant in the evening( although still really a buffet). Try and get a early evening reservation and nice to watch sun set.

Our initial room didn't suit us because of my partner's mobility issues and difficulties with the shower over the bath, so we asked if any other room was available. Reception couldn't have been more helpful and we ended up in the most amazing suite with a separate shower. Thank you to the reception for their help with this, we didn't expect such a lovely gesture. We have stayed in many Riu hotels around the world and this one has to be amongst the best of them. The food was fabulous and varied, even for an extremely fussy eater like me. Lots of fish which my partner loved and beautiful fresh salads. The cheese was amazing, especially the blue cheese. The dining room staff were fantastic, attentive and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,4,Another great time,"We have just returned from our second time at this hotel. we were a group of 6 friends, 4 of us have been before. The hotel was beautifully clean ,the staff were friendly and the choice of food was great. The only complaint we had was the rule regarding men wearing long trousers in the restaurant. We have stayed in lots of Riu hotels and we have never been turned away as my friend was. He turned up in lovely tailored shorts and a shirt with a collar, only to be told he couldn't come in as he was wearing shorts. I don't see how is this is unacceptable when some men had joggers and flip-flops on which I don't consider evening dinner wear. Also if this is the rule for men then surely it should be the same for women. To be honest some ladies turned up in very short jean shorts that…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,1,Disaster!!!!!!!,This is not 5* Hotel!!! We've been in 3 different rooms and all of them stinked! Be prepared that all the clothes after visiting that hotel you wil have to throw to the bin because of that terrible smell! There were no cosmetic sets at all! Mattress' poor and old! Never ever again!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 October 2019,5,Fabulous hotel,"Visited early October with family and Friend . 4 of us had been before ,4 hadnt. The hotel didn’t disappoint ( unlike the weather) Rooms were lovely, staff friendly, food drink delicious . Nothing was too much trouble . Had a fabulous time . The weather was disappointing over cast most of the time but we all had a brilliant time. Was so sad to have to go home, especially as two of the eight of us were staying for 2 weeks and the rest of us a week . Highly recommend the hotel, perfect place to relax and unwind .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Great hotel,"we stayed here the first week of September and the hotel was beautiful. we did not have to 'fight' for loungers as there were plenty to spare. the management was very helpful but the waiters were very rude and abrupt. if you did not tip them, you would not get a good service, but if you did, then you would get looked after very well. I guess this is the culture? the weather was not great and out of 7 days only got 3 days so don't assume that it is always sunny, it does get cloudy a lot. I would suggest only doing half board and venturing out as the food was not all that. We checked out this great Indian restaurant called Bollywood which was great!!! You must check out the massage but not at the hotel because it is a rip off but outside. We paid something like 25 pounds for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,5,Relaxing week..,"Well what can I say.. Hotel excellent, food at the restaurants excellent, staff and service excellent, room service excellent.

Would definitely recommend staying here if this is what you are looking for you won't be disappointed.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,4,Agadir Morocco,"Lovely immaculately clean hotel, buffet was excellent, couldn’t fault the staff. Slight criticism on check in I asked if there were any room upgrades to be told the hotel was full but the internet told a different story. Rooms were large but needed some TLC, plugs wouldn’t come out of the sink and every time you flushed the toilet the back panel fell off but this did not detract from the holiday, the extremely hard beds did though, the hotel needs to invest in mattress toppers at the least.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Beautiful hotel but some of the staff let it down,"We have recently returned from our honeymoon in Agadir. The hotel is ideally situated, with direct access to the promenade and beach. The hotel itself is beautiful and fully deserves its name as a palace. The rooms are lovely and we were upgraded because it was our honeymoon.The food is excellent, lots of choice and it is changed each day. The staff are also very kind to the cats which live in the hotel which is nice to see. We also noticed that the staff are excellent with children, always making an effort with them. The majority of them are very helpful, which brings me to the more negative aspect of this review. There is a big tipping culture in Morocco and this extends to the hotel staff. We did not tip any of them until our last day and there was a marked difference in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Lovely hotel and excellent service!,"I stayed here with my partner and 9 year old son and we loved our stay and wished it had have been for longer. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very adequate in size and have a lovely split room design with the sofa etc. on a slightly lowered floor level. The rooms are cleaned daily and our mini bar stocked up well. The pool area was great which my son loved. The sun beds are plentiful and very comfortable. The food on offer at this hotel is excellent, a wide variety at breakfast, lunch and dinner and the specialty restaurants were fantastic, especially the Krystal restaurant. The wine and drinks selection was also excellent, I tried a variety of the cocktails on offer on the menu and also the porn star martini at the main bar, it was delightful. My son loved the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Good choice of hotel for Agadir!,"We stayed at the Riu Palace in September this year after debating for a while which hotel to go to. We never got to see inside any of the others however from looking outside, we felt we made the right choice. Really nice hotel, beautiful main areas, well kept and friendly staff. Lovely bar areas, no service at the pool - had to go to the bar which was fine. We were all inclusive and this included Prosecco which was a big tick for me! Food was plentiful and enjoyable - we never once had a bad meal although we were slightly disappointed with the Italian as this was also buffet style which we weren't expecting. Nice pool area with sunken bar - very busy around the pool while we were there and like others have commented, folk did reserve loungers despite being told not to. We…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,3,Good but stingey,"Lovely hotel but the surrounding wasn’t as lovely as we thought it would be.. beach smelt of wee and reminded me of one back in the UK.. not to mention how stingey they was with the water bottles! We pay all inclusive and they look like it comes out their wages when you say ‘can I have a water to take out with us?’ I think you should be aloud as many as you want! Especially in that heat! Lovely staff.. however the odd few could be a bit funny especially how some people got away with going into crystal with shorts? However my boyfriend forgot his pants so he didn’t and had to lend the people who work there’s pants? people behind the reception found it remotely funny. Don’t get me wrong, such a beautiful hotel and your greeted with a drink on arrival which was lovely. But after…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Amazing,"Great relaxing stay for a week in September. The majority of staff are so friendly, the only exception was the swim up pool bar, there was a girl serving who had absolutely no customer service skills and was so slow with service, a lot of people were getting frustrated daily with her service or lack of. We never had a problem getting a sunbed around 10.30am every morning. The pool area was cleaned daily. There was direct access to the beach for anyone who wants it too. We ate in krystal restaurant one night and it was lovely a great change from the buffet. The buffet had a wide selection of foods but becomes a bit repetitive after a few days, we ended up eating out the last 2 nights just for a change. Rooms were fab, very spacious, comfortable and clean with a nice balcony area…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,5,AMAZING!!,"My partner suprised me for my 30th Birthday and we stayed here for 1 week at the end of August 2019. The hotel is beautiful and ever so clean. The staff were so friendly and helpful, they really made the experience. Breakfast - fantastic choice with an omelette station, all variety of eggs (fried, poached etc), they serve pork sausages and bacon despite them not eating pork, variety of cereals, fresh fruit, yogurts morrocan section, pancakes and i saved the best until last; freshley cooked doughnuts which were incredible. Selection of juices and smoothies. Fresh orange juice. Tea and coffee. One ""herbal"" tea. They also have Moroccan tea which they make up from scratch. Its like peppermint tea with honey. Lunch and dinner always had a good selection and the meat was always…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,2,Riu rip off,"£120 to extend check out by 5 hrs!! Same hotel in Marrakesh earlier this year £50 which was a bit excessive. Even the Tui rep said it was outrageous but he was probably just trying to passify us. Generally the hotel is ok if a bit "" fur coat and no knickers"" as we say. Room ok but poor storage and dangerous bathroom for those not confidently mobile. Towels thin as toilet paper. Lighting in the stairs is a health and safety issue for older people. A modest amount of attention to detail would lift this hotel which is a long way from the staff training and quality of its sister hotel in Marrakesh. Waiters seem to have favourites. Generally a decent place but could be much better.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,4,Worth every penny,"Stayed here from the 6th June for one week, went as couple and with another couple and it really was lovely. Hotel is lovely and considering we paid £600 each for 1 week all inclusive it was really good value for money. The food is nice, in the main buffet there is a large choice which changes daily and the drinks are alright the cocktails were a bit weak and sometimes they use not proper spirits, be sure to ask. There are 2 restaurants, we went to the crystal restaurant and it was really nice - it’s in a nice surroundings and quite formal, nice to go to after the buffet. The pool restaurant does get very busy can be a bit hectic, the staff here weren’t as good as the main restaurant staff and seemed to only be interested in the French clientele. The hotel itself is really…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Great hotel shame about the weather,"I stayed here for one week from 23/9/19. The hotel reception is opulent and a great place for people watching, having a drink or just to relax. Our room on the ground floor overlooking the pool was spacious but smelt damp, as we arrived in the early hours we did not have the energy to go back to reception after checking in the complain about the room. We were unable to have the patio door open as for four days the weather was overcast, damp, foggy and very chilly. Once we could air the room it seemed to smell better. The food was amazing with plenty of choice for all tastes. The main restaurant was slightly too big In my opinion and a bit too dark during the day. The waiting staff in all the bars and restaurants were excellent. The pool water was very cold but the sun beds…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,4,Disappointed,"Can’t help but feel a little disappointed with this hotel. This is the 5th Riu Palace we’ve visited, the others have been in the Caribbean, and it doesn’t come close to any of them. To be fair, we did pay a lot more for the Caribbean, but this hotel is no where near a 5 star. The rooms are clean and spacious, but I found the bed very hard. I ended up asking for another quilt and using that as a mattress topper, which helped slightly. We did have to lock our door and put the do not disturb sign on otherwise around 5.30pm, a guy filling the mini bar would knock, then walk straight in. We found this totally unacceptable and I’m amazed he was unaware that people may have just got out of the shower. The pool area was clean and we never had problems finding a sunbed. Yes, people do…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Relaxing,A big and beautiful hotel with immaculate gardens/outside spaces. The wide variety of food at meal times was delicious and plentiful. All of the staff were friendly and always so busy but had time to make sure everyone was well looked after. The hotel was very clean and spacious. Amazing sunsets and only a short walk to the beach or shops.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Amazing staff,"Spent a week here and found it to be a lovely hotel. The rooms are very large with a balcony. On the balcony are 2 large comfortable chairs and a table. There is an extra seating area with a settee, coffee table and small table with 2 chairs. Ideal for playing cards. The fridge is stocked with water and soft drinks every day. There is air conditioning and also a ceiling fan. The bathroom has an excellent shower in the bath and handholds to help stand in the bath safely. Tea + coffee are provided and a safe. The pool area is divided into 2 and there are ample sunbeds and umbrellas available. Sadly even though the hotel asks that beds are not reserved people still reserve them early in the morning and then don't appear until after lunch. But you can always find a bed and if stuck…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,5,Perfect in every way,"This is our second trip to Rui Tikida Palace and it is just as fabulous as the first, the facilities are fantastic the staff are amazing. Manager Carlos is a great guy that just wants to give the best experience to his customers nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is immaculate in every way, this time I proposed to my girlfriend in the Moroccan restaurant and the staff made the experience a delight, they arranged flowers to present with the ring and presented them and the ring at our table when we had finished the meal.(by the way, she said “yes”) The animation team are exceptional, during the day coming over to talk to us and the evenings they work so hard in their shows they perform.

 September 2019,4,Excellent but be aware of mist,"The hotel was very good. The rooms were large and clean. The food was good in the buffet style restaurants with plenty of choice. I normally stay in hotels with more dining options but have to say didn’t miss that at all. The pool was clean great staff that couldn’t do enough. Drinks are fine and the first all inclusive I have been to where a glass of wine is greeted with a full bottle..... great in the evening, pace yourself during the day! Couple of things to be aware of in my opinion. Avoid the Moroccan restaurant. Basic and not worth going to, the buffet was much better. I thought the evening entertainment was a little amateur although the live music was good. We also had a mixture of Stephen king like mist, and really hot weather. I got the feeling the mist is not unusual…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Perfect just like our 2 previous visits.,"If this is not the best Riu hotel, then it must be pretty close to it. Cerainly the best of the many that we have been to. Excellent food and drinks served throughout our stay. Great accommodation and excellent entertainment every night. Last, but not least wonderfull staff at every level and in every department. They all look after each and everyone from check in to check out. Already looking forward to our next visit even though we have only been home 7 days.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Lovely hotel,"Just retuned from two weeks at this hotel. The staff and food couldn’t be faulted, cocktails could be better, as could the martini, this was literally the martini vermouth nothing added. The rooms are nice and big, kept clean by hardworking staff, though a little dated. On my birthday red roses arrived in my room as did a note wishing me a happy birthday. I ate in the Moroccan restaurant that night and my table was decorated with rose petals, champagne on ice at the side of the table. At the end of the meal I was presented with a chocolate birthday cake. They must have got the details from my passport as I didn’t mention it. My Sister joined me for 4 nights otherwise I was on my own. I felt totally safe and was treated well by all the staff. Unfortunately we had a bit of sea…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Everything was perfect,"I cannot fault anything during our stay here.

 October 2019,3,Has lots of potential...,"Stayed here for a week and I’ll start with the location....we were bored, not a great place if you want things to do, I also don’t think the overcast weather helped but this was not the fault of the hotel. Swimming pool area.....signs everywhere saying reserving sunbeds is not allowed, load of rubbish! People still reserve them and this does not appear to be policed leaving people unable to get a sunbed. Food areas.....we felt ignored by staff and were generally pointed in the direction they wanted us to sit, had to prompt for cutlery and glasses. Also found staff to be quite rude, in that they would walk out infont of us or stopped dead infront of us....a lack of insight to surrounding space. Bars and staff were generally very good, my only negative response is that when a bar…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Exquisite Hotel,"Visited as part of our honeymoon tour of Morocco and this hotel was a highlight. Decorated and finished to a high standard we arrived and our cases were immediately taken by staff. We were sent straight to dinner due to our time of arrival so we didn’t miss out, and then had all our luggage taken to our rooms. The room was comfy, well laid out and spotlessly clean. Each comes with a fridge which is restocked with complementary cans of soft drink and bottles of water daily. We had a balcony which was very generous and used everyday. The restaurants were all well cleaned and staffed, and the food is of a very high standard for a buffet arrangement. The table service from staff was a highlight and we always felt well looked after. The bars are very well staffed, we never waited…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Fabulous service and great hotel,"I’ve just returned from a one week break and went there open minded after reading such mixed reviews. We had a great stay, the staff could not do enough for you, they were attentive throughout and service was great throughout. The pool area had good quality comfy loungers with more than enough for everyone. Staff are truly visible and if you want something just ask. The buffet restaurant and the snack bar have lots of food to accommodate all tastes and there are new things every day, plus the drinks keep on flowing. Fully inclusive does mean everything here even in the pre book restaurants so there is nothing to pay on departure. As it was unusually cloudy for our first few days I used the spa and the hairdressers (these are understandably chargeable services) both were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2019,3,Nice hotel but poor service and food quality average,We stayed here for a week and the weather wasn’t the best however despite this we made the best of it. The staff were not particularly attentive and in fact would walk into you in the dining room for lunch if you were in their path. The food quality was average and what one expects in all inclusive and the a la carte restaurants were okay but have had better Moroccan food outside of it and there was limited choice and not good food choice for children. The facilities are good with a nice outdoor pool however getting a sun bed is a nightmare (despite rules in hotel that one couldn’t reserve sunbeds). The indoor pool is nice and could get somewhere there for the little one to swim. It is a very classical resort all inclusive resort which is okay for a weeks break in the sun but…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Don’t listen to the rubbish,Hotel was lovely and staff were so attentive and not focused on the French. Although rubbish weather to begin with me and my partner absolutely loved the hotel and Staff and would visit again because they made it so welcoming and fun. Food at the restaurants was great and staff again were more then welcoming. Let downs were complaining other holiday holiday makers who couldn’t make the most of what we had which was good.

 September 2019,4,"RIU Palace Tikida, Agadir, 2019-08-31/2019-09-21","A good Hotel, with great/exellent services, but not a 5 star Palace Hotel, more like a Club Hotel 4 stars. All the staff is very kind and service minded, but the food is almost the same for lunch and dinner every day (in the buffè restaurant).

 September 2019,5,Beautiful Hotel. Weather is Awful,"I’m here with my husband for a weeks holiday. Can’t fault hotel. Fantastic food, staff and facilities. If your booked to come here in the near future, for goodness sake bring long trousers and jumpers. Weather forecasts tell you it’s hot. This is not the case. It’s foggy, windy and cold.

 September 2019,4,Disappointing return,"When we visited this hotel four years ago it was lovely and the staff were brilliant. Unfortunately this trip was disappointing. The hotel is badly in need of refurbishment although very clean it’s really tired looking. The staff in the main buffet restaurant were too busy either talking amongst themselves or on their phones. We found the Manager to be rude and unhelpful. The waiters in the lunch time buffet were very good also in the Crystal and Moroccon restaurants. The Italian restaurant was a joke, no service it was help yourself the selection of food was better in the main restaurant. Having been to many of the Riu Palaces we would not class this as a 5 star it was more like a Riu Club Hotel. The standard of the palaces have gone down which is such a shame.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Amazing stay but not to a 5 star standard,"My boyfriend and myself decided to visit this hotel as part of a TUI all inclusive package. The hotel is portrayed to be a 5 star luxury hotel. We were looking forward to a relaxing 2 weeks away and fortunately that is what we got. However there were many negatives that we picked up on which didn’t quite make our stay level up to a 5 star standard which we were disappointed about, especially as this is what we thought we would be getting. Things that need to be addressed: we were in a room located near the lobby area and we experienced loud, disturbing noises around 9am in the morning when we were still in bed, it sounded like furniture was being dragged about and also drilling noises. We didn’t complain as we are quite laid back and treated the noises as an alarm, although it…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Fantastic Hotel on fantastic beach,"This was my third stay at Palace Tikida. The design and layout of the hotel is excellent. The staff (dining rooms, bar, cleaning and exercise) are lovely, though reception ladies could use a charm training session. The food is perfect and we particularly enjoyed the Krystal restaurant. The beach is great for nice long walks and the exercise classes run by Lassen were brilliant and much enjoyed. The only negative is the weather, which I realise you have no control over, and is the sole reason I don't come back year after year. Still a very relaxing and enjoyable two weeks. Many thanks",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,3,Average,"First time in Morocco but not the first using a Riu Palace, check in was long considering we arrived at 2am in the morning, offered us food which really was not really edible. Room was ok, fridge refilled with cold drinks (no beer) every 2nd day. Food was repetitive. Only tried Italian speciality which was buffet style nothing special. Main buffet restaurant men have to wear long trousers (why ??? It’s a buffet restaurant) the people that made our holiday we some of the entertainment staff Salah especially. Waitress Hana was very helpful. Weather was a bit hit & miss but nothing you can do about that, would I return no this hotel is not a typical Riu Palace standard",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Very happy despite some negative reviews!,"So on arrival at around 2am Tuesday morning, the reception staff were lovely and friendly, take your suitcase to your room whilst you went to the buffet to have a bite to eat. In all honesty we didn’t eat due to the bits that were out we didn’t fancy! The rooms- WOW! We had a sea view and pool view room and they are absolutely brilliant, air con is good and the french sliding doors help bring a breeze in, safe and mini bar are included and the mini bar is re filled every 2 days which I think is brilliant. Pool - yes you do have to reserve your sunbed if you like the same spot, however if your later coming down to the pool for example lunch time there will always be someone around to help you find a spot.

 September 2019,4,great stay in agadir,the only criticisms I can make are 1) lack of toilets in general and particularly the beach area and 2) the pushy nature of the hotel baggage handlers on arrival and departure almost demanding a tip before leaving our bedroom and carrying our cases to the coach. They got nothing from me purely due to their insolent nature spoiling what were otherwise immaculate hotel services.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Very nice hotel,My husband and I have just had a weeks all inclusive holiday here. It was our first trip to Morocco and we were not disappointed and will definitely go back. The hotel staff couldn’t have been more helpful when we checked in getting us sorted very quickly and giving us all the information we needed straight away without confusing us. They took our luggage to our room and got us settled in. Our room was lovely clean and spacious with everything we needed. I love a kettle in our room. I know there are drinks available 24/7 but sometimes you just want a cuppa! The food in the hotel was very good and the buffet provided a wide variety. We tried the other restaurants which we thoroughly enjoyed too. The pool area did get a bit busy with lots of people saving beds but if you…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We wanted a great hotel with an airy room, great food and lovely beach and to rest and relax it was perfect! Never been all inclusive before so was expecting just bog standard food and service.

 September 2019,3,"Disappointing, very tired hotel","We were originally booked into RIU’s new hotel Taghazout, Agadir but we were told in June that it wouldn’t be open in time, TUI offered us this hotel as being a similar standard and as the rating was 5T we accepted the alternative. Having been here for nearly 2 weeks I can say for sure this isn’t a 5T standard hotel, at best a 4. The hotel is very tired and badly in need of a refurbishment. The rooms are OK but lack sufficient power sockets and anywhere for women to sit and do hair and make up. Our room had a bath with over bath shower but no rubber mat for the bath so was quite dangerous getting out after a shower especially onto a marble floor. On the plus side the maids kept the room spotlessly clean. There is one main pool and at times can be very busy, there are 2 pool…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,3,Unfortunately not a 5 star,"I had difficulty deciding on the rating of this hotel. Overall, due to hygiene, quality of the food, and the hotel being in need of a refurb in places I would say it only manages a 4 star. However, it does have a couple of facilities worthy of a 5 star rating. Aside from the lobby area it definitely lacks the wow factor of a five star. Welcome - friendly welcome but no assistance with luggage or offer to be shown to the room (unusual for 5 star). We had a room at the end of the corridor and all the lights were out on arrival which felt unsafe, we requested the next day for the lights to be put on, this was facilitated.

 September 2019,4,"Good, Could be Great with Some Effort","Having been to other RIU properties before, we felt that this one fell somehow short of our expectations. Mainly because of some major points: Room: bring your own shampoo/conditioner. There is only a body wash all in one product in the rooms. Strange for a 5-star hotel. One of our rooms had a safe that didn't work. We were required to waste 1 hour and a half at the hotel because they required us to be in the room during the maintenance even though we had just arrived and could just as easily put everything on our second room. Pool: even though it is clearly stated on the hotel guide they give you at check-in that is forbidden to reserve a sunbed leaving towels unattended, the staff at the hotel completely ignores this behaviour or worse, tries to encourage it. As soon as 8…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,4*tops,Just got back from a weeks stay here with my husband and family went for my 60th birthday and our 20th wedding anniversary.The hotel is very nice maby 5* in some areas ie reception area but other areas of the hotel needed care and attention hence my 4* rating.Having said that all the staff were very friendly nothing was to much trouble for them brill in the dining room on my birthday all the staff came out with a cake and sang happy birthday in moroccon it was a lovely touch.Roses left in my room and champagne made me feel very special.Must mention Soufiome one of the managers in the lunch time restaurant went out of his way to get some almond milk for my granddaughter as she cant have cows milk the food in the buffet restaurant was fine nice hotel would recommend.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Nice holiday but food let it down,"We stayed at the hotel for a week and had a really good time. Room was lovely and clean. Tv was HUGE and bed was lovely and comfy. Can’t fault the room at all, was great. Pool was nice as were all the bars. Branded drinks only at front bar, be good if that was in all the bar. Staff all friendly as expected and the animation team was cool. Managed to get loungers reserved every mornings which was great. Only downside was the food ... it was poor! The Italian restaurant was a buffet and served exactly the same as the main buffet. Main buffet was very same same every day. The made to cook pasta was nice but had to wait for ages to get served. Service at the table was good but never had the same waiter which I thought lacked a personal touch. Breakfast I feel could be improved…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,4,Great hotel,"We have just returned from a two week stay at this hotel. The hotel has great access to the beach which has lovely golden sands. The pool area is huge and even through some people got up early to put out their towels you can always find a sunbed if not the pool staff will locate you one and a parasol and they will always move the beds to an area you prefer. The area around the pool is very clean and the gardens are lovely. Both pool bar staff are polite and helpful. When you enter the hotel the reception area is very large with comfortable seating areas and this is where you will also find your entertainment room and the 24 hour bar. However what makes this hotel is its staff and the food. The staff in all the bars and restaurants were polite and helpful, a special mention…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,3,11 nights too long,"My boyfriend and I stayed here at the end of August for 11 nights and couldn’t wait to go home after a week. First impressions of the hotel are good, lobby area is huge and looks nice. When booking we could only book a twin room as no other rooms were available. We arrived around 1am so stayed our first night in the twin room. My boyfriend went to reception the next morning to see if there was any chance of an upgrade and how much it would be. The lovely man on reception gave us a key to a huge junior sweet to have a look and see if we liked it. Of course we went straight back down to ask for the price and were given it for no extra cost! We never got his name but thank you very much! The majority of reviews regarding the pool are pretty accurate. Lots of sun beds reserved…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,5,Fantastic week,"Me and my boyfriend went to the hotel for our first proper Holiday together for a week, and it really didn’t disappoint. The staff were brilliant, the reception staff were helpful and would deal with any issues you had immediately, for example when we arrived our safe in the room was closed and within 20 minutes of telling reception there’s was a technician from outside the hotel in our room opening it for us! The restaurant and bar staff can not be faulted, when dining I don’t think I poured my own drink collectively about 6 times and the same for my boyfriend, brilliant wines available at all meal times and the service in the buffet restaurant is just as good as that in the Krystal fusion restaurant. Bar staff were mostly fantastic, specifically Abdulatiff (we called him…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,4,Family Hotel,Enjoyed my stay. Nice clean hotel. The hotel itself is in a good location and I would stay again cause the negative things you can live with. I got bored with the food quickly. Only thing I did not like the English were not treated as nice as the other European customers. I was ignored at the bar on more than one occasion and they were not friendly at all. Place being clean means more than a few rude staff. Transport by TUI rep was bad she was more interested inserting her nightlife out.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,3,Not the worst however needs improvement..,"We have just returned from a 10 day holiday at the Riu Palace and it’s safe to say we are a little disappointed. First impressions were great, being greeted on arrival by Zineb our lovely Tui rep and driven to the hotel.. At first glance the hotel is absolutely amazing ! Decor you couldn’t fault it really is stunning.. however I really feel they’ve spent too much perhaps on that and the money should be invested elsewhere! We checked in and was about to walk to our room when the porter approached us and was insisting he would be right behind us and take our cases We didn’t receive them for an hour so I went to check and they was the only ones pretty much left in the lobby with no one to be seen ! I found some staff rude, they wasn’t very helpful when I had left my phone on…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,3,Lovely hotel but not 5 star,Just came back from his hotel which we stayed 10 days at. There is both good and bad points to this hotel. Good points - - The hotel itself is lovely it’s a massive hotel which has a modern finish. The lobby is massive and has a lovely and modern finish to. The sofas and chairs are so comfy! - we normally ate at the hotels restaraunt at night and the staff are so friendly. Need to shout out to samira and achraf they are so lovely and would do anything for you. Achraf always had our drinks ready for us for when we arrived. Nothing was too much trouble. - the rooms are cleaned every day - the mini bar was stocked every day with water and soft drinks and was free which is a plus - most cocktails in the all inclusive hotels I’ve been to you have to pay for but in this hotel…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,2,"Agadir, oh dear","This fails to live up to the usual Palace standards I expect from Riu. Sadly passed it's best it's best and is a mediocre 4 star rating in my opinion. The reception area is nice and kept clean but the rest fails to meet hygiene standards we'd expect from a place describing as 5 star. The main buffet restaurant is ok, the staff were friendly and attentive especially Brahim and Youseff, tour guide said staff are not employed by hotel but are on work placements as pat of their hospitality training. The guys all wanted to shake your hand which is nice but unhygienic. The lunch time buffet was dirty and chaotic, called Il Mare, we dubbed it Ill Nightmare. Cold food, dirty table wiped quickly with dry cloth before being reset, unused cutlery and glasses just lifted and reused without…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,4,"Great, but NOT 5*","Visited this hotel in August as a family of 7, with 2 children. Huge pool, nice clean rooms, and lovely grounds and communal areas. Sunbeds disappear at busy times unless you pay the pool boy a few £ to reserve them for you, or are prepared to get up at 7am to put your towels down. Food became very monotonous after 2 weeks, and this is what let’s the hotel down!! The Italian al a carte, isn’t al a carte....it’s just buffet style serving Italian food in the lunch time restaurant. There’s always a lot of choice in the main restaurant for lunch and dinner, but always the same. No variation!! All staff very friendly and helpful. A couple of ££ goes a long way to getting extra special treatment. Special thanks to El Alaoui our pool bar guy, and Redouane our evening waiter for being…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,3,Needs lots of work :(,"We stayed here on a family holiday in July, the overall holiday was nice but certainly not amazing, I feel that the hotel needs a lot of investment to warrant its 5 star rating, the quality and variety of restaurants was questionable and the drink’s were dreadful all local drinks which was a shame. If you are looking for pure sunshine day in day out I would strongly consider not booking July / August. The Entertainment team were poor and there was very little for the children to do, the beach is like a refugee camp and isn’t worth a visit, I would rate this hotel 4 star maximum it needs a lot of work! Unfortunately we wouldn’t return given the options available in other European Countries. We all want to love our holidays however this is not somewhere we would consider again…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,4,quite week in Agadir,"Couldn't fault the hotel. 5 stars, We did find some of the bar staff a bit miserable,but we all have bad days i guess. I would recommend the hotel, very good, food excellent, rooms amazing and air-con worked well in the room and kept us cool. I wouldn't go to Agadir again though, as the mist or fog lasted the duration of the holiday. It was warm but unfortunately i think July & August are the two worst months that they have this problem. Unperturbed we went out and about into the town and market and still had a great time, just no sunshine which is the real reason for going. I have only given value for money 3 stars. This is nothing to do with the hotel as it was very good, but directed at TUI. We looked at this holiday a few times and as the date got nearer the price went up…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,4,Hot in Morocco,"We arrived st the Rui Palace Hotel. A very impressive building. We were told we could not book in till 3pm. We waited and waited. I had to go to the reception 3 times to complain we were still waiting for our rooms to be ready. Eventually they gave us news rooms as our rooms were still not ready. Do we unpacked and went to explore the venue. 4 different bars and restaurants self service and al la carte. Plenty of food many choices. If they were busy it was hard to get a waiter to take your order so we had to go to the bar on many occasions. Entertainment every night, pool keep fit, games for the kids. Outside there were many shops to explore. The beach was nice, but no amenities, just sun beds and camel rides, which were a bit of a rip off. Also beach full of camel pop. All…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2019,4,Good all inclusive,"The lobby is impressive, the grounds well kept, the rooms large we had a ground floor room - pool view - if you book a standard room - check if it faces the road. 4 bars - 2 outside were not open in an evening - the drinks are ok - decent local lager. cocktails too sweet - the spirits are local. At the lobby bar - the drinks seem to be of a better standard - I would have liked the option to pay more for better quality cocktails & wine - if you like wine - bring some with you. 2 main buffets & the food is good (can be a bit cold) & it does get a bit samey. There are 3 bookable restaurants - book them in advance. The Italian is in the buffet restaurant near the sea & seemed to be the same as the food in the main buffet - Pizzas & lasagne are good.

The pool staff are amazing, made my little girl feel very safe in the pool and very friendly. I would highly recommend to do the croc park, which is fantastic for adults and children, 3 0 clock trip tho, as get to watch crocs be fed. Also highly recommend the sunset camel bbq ride, although it's a long time on the camel, well worth it.

The accommodations are beautiful and the proximity to the beach allows for a wonderful time (early morning or late night walks on the sand).

The Palace is definitely the best hotel in Agadir, by far! It truly is a Palace. Huge lobby and dining areas, the pool and surrounding garden areas are fantastic. All the staff including the waiters, cleaners, bar staff, pool attendants, all work very hard and provide a very good service. The cloud! We were almost going to cancel our holiday as we read reviews about the cloud and haze. But we found that there was some haze early on, but by 11am it was blue skies and sunshine and 30+ degree heat!

If you like peace and quiet or a relaxing atmosphere (like us) then this isn’t the holiday for you. The hotel itself is lovely.. you really can’t fault the staff, service, food, rooms or entertainment my only issue was the pool during the daytime , music was WAY too loud for me, so much so that the one day it was so loud I tried putting on headphones and still could hear the rap music that was being played loudly through the speakers . This for me was a deal breaker, and spoilt our week. On our last day we felt we needed to speak to the manager about some of the music being played round the pool, rap Music with lots of swearing and explicit sexual Content I did not feel was suitable for young children.

I was in room 3091 which was a very good standard and had an excellent balcony. The food here is great although sometimes more variety would be welcomed, but on the whole the food is up to standard. Every evening there is entertainment, the performances were what you might expect but compared to other Riu resorts I have stayed the shows seem to be similar in what they offer.

She asked my partner to go to the bar and relax as it was her birthday. She then spoke to me about booking a meal in the Italian restaurant to celebrate her birthday which would include flowers and champagne. She said it was all free of charge so obviously I accepted.

Other than that all the staff without exception were fantastic so helpful and friendly. The evening entertainment I did not attend.

The food was good with lots of choice in the main restaurant but could get manic. The only problem if you have any allergies to nuts etc, there were no signs saying what was in the food and I had to be careful, We went to the Crystal Restaurant twice which was lovely and the steaks were delicious and we went to the Moroccan Restaurant which was nice but probably not to everyone's taste.

The food was outstanding, served on sometimes too hot a plate having just been cleaned and refreshed back out on the floor. My only moan is the entertainment for younger children. It was utterly dire. He kids club was so dull. The kids staff lacked enthusiasm and didn't look like they wanted to be there. At all.

The lunch was also great choice at the snack bar but I found service to be poorer here. The beds in the room were very hard and uncomfortable but was made better by adding a duvet underneath, rooms were always spotlessly cleaned by the maids who did a great job.

My sister and daughter came with me for one weeks all inclusive holiday. This is only my second all inclusive holiday so I have little to compare it to and possibly high expectations but the reason I’ve rated it average is down to the majority of the staff attitudes, the poor entertainment, the extremely slow bar service, the lack of care of the cleanliness of the rooms towards the end of our stay, the organisation of sun beds and the almost non existant ‘minibar’.

The downside for this hotel is the level of the food. Unfortunately there is too little choice of eating areas so the buffet is rammed every service. The ""specialty restaurants"" don't live up to their there name as the food is in my opinion no better then the buffet. The Italian does not come across as a specialty but is just…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,4,Another great 3 weeks,"Was due to be staying at the new Riu in Tagazhout but it is still not finished but decided to stay here as we had last year and had a wonderful time. Again, had a great time - it’s the staff that make this place what it is - especially Brahim in the bar, Ahmed in the bar and Hassan in the snack bar. The food is very good quality and they try and cater for every taste but did tend to end up eating pizza rather a lot but who’s complaining. Hotel very clean and our cleaner was lovely - same as last year as we asked for the same room. We had a lovely quiet garden room and the gardeners do an amazing job cleaning the grounds immaculate. I would definitely recommend.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,4,Lovely but not 5star,"I’ve got to say I warmed to this hotel, it’s big and busy but beautiful surroundings and the staff try and accommodate every need! I loved our room it’s big and spacious and the decor is lovely! Our view was beautiful of the pool and sea! Food is really good here!! I tried Krystal and it was ok, it was my birthday and had roses and champagne which my boyfriend has organised with one of the lovely staff members! The pool area is very busy and not always enough chairs for all unless you get down early and save them! But the chairs are comfy and wooden! Drinks are decent enough and never a big wait to be served! We sat outside most nights eating dinner and it was so much calmer and relaxed! there’s few things that make it not a 5star like the bedding needs updating and the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,Honeymoon,"We came here for our honeymoon. The hotel is kept lovely and clean and very welcoming. As it was our honeymoon we got upgraded to a suite which was amazing. The food is lovely, lots to choice from. The only Restaurant we were disappointed with was the Italian, which is a buffet which serves food you can get at lunch time and in the main buffet. The pool is lovely as for sunbeds you will need to go and put your towels down before breakfast as you might find it hard to get them. We definitely liked being around the pool than going to the beach. Overall we had a brilliant stay and high recommend this hotel",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,4,5star in reality 4star Hotel,"Very impressed with the Grand entrance hall, shame it was not air conditioned. Reception Bar great drinks but not always available as the holiday makers kept drinking the bar ‘literally’ dry. Rooms large and comfortable ‘recommend taking an extension 4x way lead’ as you only need 1x travel plug 🔌. Pool can be busy so obligatory up early to put the towels out ( take your own - even though Hotel supplies them free ). Mark your area. Food is A+ 5star get there early not too busy and fresh as you like. So many choices try everything. I would recommend this Hotel - 👍🏻 Book the two executive restaurants early as they are both small and get booked up quick especially if you are celebrating a special event. Evening entertainment - Score card would definitely say could do better…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2019,5,First visit to Morocco,"We are only a few days in to our holiday but thought would leave a review as we are absolutely loving our holiday so far! Arrival to airport was an experience, as soon as we left the airport building you have men grabbing at your cases as clearly just want money but a firm “no” and “no money” saw them move on quickly to someone else. We have found shopkeepers quite persistent in sales tactics but a firm “no thank you” works and they are not offended. The Moroccans we have met have been outstandingly friendly. First time to Morocco and we feel hotel is excellent value for money. It’s a large hotel but it’s spacious layout and design means there is plenty of room and even by the pool there is plenty of space. Easy to change currency at reception. Lots of staff so no long waits…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Pools are big with plenty of sunbeds no need to fight over them pool boys will help you find one! Rooms are big and very clean. Location right on the beach walk along the prom to the Marina restaurants and shops along the way. Again the staff are the stars of this Hotel!!

 June 2019,4,Relaxing stay. Nice hotel. Ok resort,"The hotel is very good overall and was good value for money. Reception on arrival was met with a welcome drink and the usual form filling. Rooms were nice and spacious with a balcony. There were some ants by the door but we had brought our own ant trap from home so not an issue. Bed was firm but comfy. We gave the maid a small tip and she came back with extra toiletries and robes. Soft drinks and water in fridge - you can get beer if you ask at reception or catch the man who restocks the fridge. Food is very good, wide choice in the buffet and a good standard. House white wine and red wine are both very drinkable and all drinks are served to you. We preferred to sit outside to eat as it was a it cooler - sometimes had a short wait to be seated but not too long. Lunch…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2019,5,Excellent service,"We spent a week at this hotel and we truly enjoyed our stay. The staff were amazing and literally NOTHING was too much for them.

One of our most enjoyable holidays.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,4,Lovely hotel but not 5 star,"Stayed here for a week from 18th July with my partner, my son and his friend. Prior to arriving, I emailed the hotel asking for adjacent rooms for the 4 of us, one room with twin small doubles and one with super king-size (which is what the website says the rooms have ""these 45-m2 rooms, you'll find two small double beds (110x200 cm) or one super king-size bed (200x200 cm)"" but the response from the hotel reception was that all rooms have twin beds but they'd put two together for us with a large sheet. We arrived around midnight after a late and slightly delayed flight (why do Tui schedule their flights at such times?) and check-in was reasonable and we were soon in our rooms to unpack. The rooms are huge - much bigger than I have stayed in before in RIU hotels, but strangely…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2019,5,Lovely hotel and great staff!,"We had a great stay here three and a half years previously and once again it didn't disappoint, not the best start as our pool view room only had a view of a tree but we were promised a different room the day after due to being fully booked, we were then moved to a room on the top floor with an amazing view happy days! Our room was a really good size with everything we needed, the pool area is really nice with such comfy loungers with a pull out table which is ideal and there was a chilled out vibe, bar areas in and out were decent, a slight niggle is the AI beer was a bit flat at times but this was mainly from the outside bars, the lobby bar in the evenings was really good though. The location of the hotel is great with some shops and a few bars out the front and straight onto…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,Not 5* but nice hotel,"Not what we expected for our family holiday unfortunately We had high hopes for this hotel after reading reviews on here & social media, but we were sadly disappointed. The positives- we found the hotel to be very clean including our room. Wide variety of food which was always nice. 95% of the staff are very friendly & more than accommodating. The animation team are lovely, very friendly & try to get you involved in all activities. I would not say it’s 24 hour catering, unless you include nuts olives or hard bread. Not always pool towels available. No iron or board in the room. You can request one but make sure you ask for both or you’ll just get an iron & no ironing board!!! If you like warm beers this is the place for you. If your wanting 5* service you must tip! …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,5,Best so far,"I,ll start with the negatives of our holiday.When we got to our room my wife refused to unpack her suitcase until we got another room and i fully agreed with her.How many times have you been to any hotel anywhere in the world and never have a single drawer to put your clothes in.Luckily as the hotel was not full we were moved to another room straight away,plus it was an upgrade to a mini suite, this room had 3 whole drawers to fill up so that took care of the wifes underwear plus a little bit for me.For a 5* hotel thats not great.The next downer was the same the whole world over,who keeps getting up in the dead of night to put their towels on the sun loungers what is the matter with you people get a life and leave your alarm clocks at home.The main restaurant is not bad with…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,5,Exceeded expectations - great holiday in this lovely hotel,"Check in was quick and easy. Our luggage was taken to our rooms by the porter (Bellboy). The rooms were spacious.The double bed was huge. There was adequate storage for our clothing. The bathroom was well kept and clean with a hairdryer. Out the back of the hotel, across the promenade is the beach area. The downside of using this was that the locals approach you frequently trying to sell their goods. Around the pool, there are pool attendants who will find you a sunbed and umbrella. There was a lot of entertainment on offer throughout the day. The food was great. Plenty of variety and of good quality. The waiter service is excellent and very attentive; topping up drinks when low. The entertainment at the beginning to middle of the week was good but deteriorated towards the end…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,3,Lovely hotel but weather for July disappointing,"Food 🍲🥗🍔- is generally good - standard stuff at an all inclusive but restaurants are very busy and a bit noisy, hostess often takes us to a table that needs cleaning and re laying first. I recommend sitting outside it’s quieter and less hectic. Rooms - lovely rooms on a split level, asked for adjoining but didn’t get this but got two rooms next to each other. No separate shower so have to use the shower over bath, which has no light. Garage type Arabic music very loud in room until 11:30pm not from hotel but from street as our room faces side road where there are stalls selling stuff. Moving to other side of hotel tomorrow to get away from music. beds are a bit hard. Pool area - 🏊🏻‍♀️👙they seem to run out of towels frequently, lots of sun beds reserved. Pool is quite…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,4,"Good Hotel, lovely stay, but could improve in some areas.","Stayed at the Riu Tikida Palace for 10 days with my other half and this was our second holiday together. Overall we were pleased with our experience of Morocco, but there is room for improvement. Hotel, Room and Surroundings: The hotel itself was beautiful and a lot bigger than it looks on pictures. Really like the traditional Moroccon decor that is around the hotel with the dark wood and stone. Very spacious inside the lobby and always lively. We stayed in a pool view standard room on the 4th floor and couldn’t fault the view at all. The room was always cleaned to a top standard and the mini fridge topped up every day with cans of pop and water, but no beer. However, a couple we met had tins of beer in theirs. The outside seats were too small for the balcony as when we were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2019,5,Great Staff and Great Location,"Stayed here for 10 days on a package with Tui. Although the hotel was busy I thought it was generally excellent. The staff in particular were superb.....they couldn’t do enough to help. The rooms were comfortable and clean. We had a couple of issues with one of our rooms however reception were helpful and understanding. The highlight was the food. Great variety, good quality and plentiful. Unfortunately you can’t escape the ‘towel on sun-bed at dawn’ brigade but the staff always found sun-beds for us. Would happily revisit!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,5,Overall really goos,"Staff - most were really lovely and couldn’t do enough for you but a few were stand offish, but effort works both ways. Bedroom - the bedroom was a decent size we were happy about that only thing is the bed sheets needed renewed I found them to be a bit bobbly (for a 5* I expected lush bedding). Maids always tidied up well couldn’t ask for more really. New towels everyday etc. Restaurants / food - saw a lot of people complain on here about food, nothing wrong with it loads of variety, well cooked, good standard. Marrakech and Krystal restaurant would totally recommend they were great. Bars - they were fine no queues, everyone treat the same cocktails were actually okay I always drank mojito. Pool - pool was really good I think, people fixing the broken tiles on the daily.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,5,Improving perfection,"It’s not difficult to find motivation to post my 5th review of this wonderful property given the improvement it somehow manages to achieve despite hitting very high standards consistently. The betterment is incremental but still noticeable - even better service, nicer more varied food and the grounds looking the best the ever have. The resort director Nader, his assistant Carlos and each and every member of the team deserve high praise. Rather than write more, I’m very pleased to post these unfiltered, raw pics which speak thousands of words about the loveliness of this property - deserving of all its Tripadvisor accolades. I look forward to our 6th visit, it can’t come quick enough.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Hotel is spotless and rooms are incredible, never stayed anywhere where you get a free minibar in the room! Only downfall to hotel is the entertainment! Boring and naff, but other than that everything was amazing! Tip- bring a pen with you on the aeroplane as you have to fill out a visa on the plane, then again on the coach transfer! Nothing to do with the hotel but be careful outside the hotel, there were times I didn’t feel safe when we were walking around the shops and then we walked slightly more further into agadir but we soon went back as men started shouting at us and running across the roads to show us jewellery, paintings etc. But you get this everywhere…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,5,Wonderful stay,We stayed at the Tikida Palace for one week 8-15 July and we absolutely loved the hotel and the city itself. We’ve stayed in some really nice all inclusive hotels previously and the Tikida was every bit as good. We opted for a larger junior suite and the size and quality of accommodation was great. It also had really good AC which was fantastic as I hate sleepy in a hot stuffy room. The staff were all really polite and helpful and most spoke reasonable English although we occasionally used French. Food was excellent. Anyone who says it’s repetitive clearly has a very limited palate. Everything Is spotlessly clean including the pool. My only criticism is that there seem to be very few loos around the hotel and pool area. We had a couple of day trips - one to the Souk which is…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,5,Superb location with staff and food to match,This was our second visit and was as good as last time albeit busier. The weather was exceptional and all the restaurants were first class. We had a preference for the Italian as we liked location and sitting outside. Staff in all areas so friendly and helpful including lady who cleaned our room who was amazing and couldn’t do enough to help. You have great employee there. We seemed to be the only people regularly tipping with Dirams20 but this gave us slightly better service which we appreciated. Only slight negative is the British seem to have adopted if you can’t beat the Germans join them in putting out towels early morning which we also needed to do. Can’t recommend location and venue enough and all inclusive at realistic prices.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our stay was so lovely very relaxing, the grounds of the hotel was beautiful lots of hard work done by the gardeners. Food was very nice Indeed, lots of choice very International, the 2 Ala Carte restaurants we visited Krystal and the Moroccan were very good Indeed Krystal was our favourite. Gents must wear trousers In these restaurants, the lobby bar does have International brand spirits also the Prosecco Is very nice Indeed.

Before arriving at the hotel, I was slightly worried reading reviews about leaving the hotel as we are two ladies, however I was completely wrong. There is security at the front & back of the hotel, as well as staff on the beach not allowing locals to sell things across the reserved area. Also they are all lovely & actually very funny!! The staff were fantastic and a real credit to the hotel, especially the gentleman working on the beach. Out of the four restaurants we preferred the Krystal, the steak was to die for. We usually don’t book all inclusive as we like to go and explore however this was a cut above other all inclusive hotels with lots of choice, fresh & well presented.

As well as a big balcony with sun beds, chairs, table and with us being on the ground floor we could walk out onto the beach if we wanted. The room was cleaned every day as well!

 July 2019,5,Fantastic hotel and facilities,"We stayed here for a week and would highly recommend. We didn’t read the reviews of the hotel until we were at the airport 😂😂, but we definitely were not disappointed. All I can say is if you find anything majorly wrong it’s a rarity or your being extremely picky. From entering the property it was clear to see that no expense has been spared, the decoration is in keeping with the Moroccan theme throughout including very spacious well equipped rooms. Tipping We read varied comments about tipping, our experience was as follows. We tip at the end of our stay and we have so far found that the service by the restaurant and bar staff has been brill. We have noticed that if you tip the waiters they will run round after you fetching and carrying and make your table a little more…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,5,Just what the doctor ordered,"I booked our stay directly on the hotel’s website, they were running a promotion so it was a good deal. The hotel doesn’t have a shuttle to and from the airport so you’ll need to organise a taxi or transfers yourself if you’re not doing a package. The foyer of the hotel is impressive, the reception staff are polite and efficient, especially Nouhalla. Checking in and out was smooth. We had a pool view room on the second floor which was spacious and lovely, plus the noise didn’t carry from the pool and you could see the sea from our balcony. The rooms are very clean. At mealtimes there is plenty of choice, however I’d like to have seen more Moroccan cuisine on offer. We dined in both the Krystal and Marrakesh restaurants, both have very stylish interiors. I was looking for a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,Lovely relaxing hotel,"Before I speak about the hotel, I have to mention a couple things that were disappointing about TUI. First of all, our flight to Agadir was delayed and we could not find any Tui representatives at Gatwick to get any information and secondly the rep at Agadir airport on our return was not particularlt helpful. On to the hotel. From the time we arrived at around half past one in the morning and were shown to the dining room where food and drink had been provided until the day we left, the service all around was excellent and as my wife said to me, she had probably the most relaxed holiday ever. I have read some of the other reviews and to be honest can't believe a lot of the negative aspects as we had a terrific time. The only thing I will say is there are not enough toilets…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,Just returned June 2019,We have been to this hotel before In 2017. And I have to say it is still as good. we did the special restaurant's excellent service . Layla the manager in Krystal is an amazing lady very friendly and cant do enough for you nothing is to much trouble. I know a lot have people have mentioned tipping and say you get a better service this is untrue. but it is appreciated some of the younger staff don't get paid a wage when they are in training so the odd tip goes along way for them. The hotel is clean and tidy cleaners are never far away the rooms are large all have bed sofa chairs and table balconies have two comfy chairs and coffee table if you whish to sit out.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Staff were quick to take our suitcases for us and tag them to ensure they wouldn't get mixed up. We received a beverage upon arrival, the check-in process was quick and easy and the staff at the desk gave us a quick concise run through of the main amenities of the hotel.

The service was impeccable from the moment we reached the hotel, everyone on the flight (bearing in mind we reached in the middle of the night) our luggage was carried in from the coach to reception and we were greeted with welcome drinks whilst waiting to be checked in.

By the way Tui were next to useless throughout this holiday but this does not constitute my review marking which is based on this hotel. Herewith some constructive feedback points for the hotel: WiFi worst of any hotel I have visited in 4 years. Horrendous in fact. Needs bandwidth urgently.

Towels provided, fridge with soft drinks, beer and water. You can’t drink their tap water. Plenty of clothes storage for 2. Shower gel provided also, see my negatives a little later.

The hotel and staff were so good in the past that we imagined coming here until we were no longer able to travel. However, our recent stay had a number of disappointments. In the past it was unusual to walk through the reception and bar area without seeing cleaning staff at work. This time it was unusual to see them. Cutbacks? At the pool area we tended to sit in one of the raised sections which are quieter. The area had not been cleaned for some time. Round the pool is cleaned every day but they seem to miss out the raised areas. Mentioned it to staff at the pool, not interested. Had to complain to reception. Next day a brush was left in the area but no attempt made to clean it. Perhaps the brush…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,"A lengthy review but its worth a read, cannot wait to come back here!","This is a long review but will cover everything you need to know if you're thinking of coming here: arrival at airport - be prepared to fill in at least 2 immigration papers, luckily only short and sweet but have a pen handy! a lot of security at the airport but was very quick to get through. once you get through and have your bags you go out to find your coat. we only had the one bus for our hotel so didn't have to stop at any other hotel, bonus! there will be people trying to take your bags to the coach from the airport (all of 20 yards!) don't let them take your bags as they will expect a tip. just say you have no money and they will go away. onto the hotel: on arrival - another paper to fill in but this made check in nice and quick, also people there to take bags if you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,4,Second Visit,"Our second visit to this lovely hotel located a few steps away from the beach. The room was spacious and was cleaned on a daily basis and fresh towels given. As mentioned, it was located near the beach with many shops, restaurants and a queue of taxis if you needed to travel a littler further out. There is also a little shop in the hotel but it is slightly more expensive than the local shops. There is a gym if you need to keep your fitness up with adequate equipment. There is also a long promenade if you want a long walk but be prepared to be bothered by the locals trying to sell donuts, sunglasses, cheap jewllery etc., it can be a little annoying. The spa on site is worth a visit with great body scrubs and massages-a must. If needed, there is also a hair…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2019,3,Should have been good but didn’t happen.....,"The reception is really impressive in this hotel. Check in was smooth with your bags taken to your room for you as you would expect of the Riu Palace. Room was huge with dark decor, really nice. We got there at night so went to bed after a quick drink. When we got up in the morning we went to get a spot round the pool. I have to agree with some of the reviews that it needs a bit of tlc, but didn’t really bother us. Found the staff ok on the whole but a little unfriendly sometimes. The weather was strange, overcast and a little chilly to be honest but then got burnt to a crisp!! Lol. On night 3 I started with gastric problems! Felt like death. Hubby went to nearby chemist and got a stash of drugs for me. 24 hours later I’d stopped being sick etc but then was just like a wet…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,3,Not what we expected for 5*,"This is a huge all inclusive hotel, loads of facilities, beautiful pool, entertainment rooms and a gym. If you want a mass produced get away, this is a the perfect hotel for you. However, if you’re looking for something more bespoke & individual, this isn’t the hotel for you. Unfortunately, I don’t think I realised this when booking this trip. This hotel is more suited for under 30s, 50+ or families with young children. Not the destination for a chilled luxurious holiday with a friend. Rooms: Spacious room, decorated well, with appropriate furniture. However there are a number of issues with the room, which I would not expect from a 5 star, such as: - Towels are old and need replacing - No good complimentary toiletries and the shower/gel soap dispenser was something you’d…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,Great holiday,"Great service, good food and a relaxing atmosphere Would definitely recommend the spa, massage was superb! Really clean and all the staff are very friendly and helpful.

 January 2019,5,Great value and very relaxing,"This is one of the only all inc. holidays I have ever been on. At the time I had just worked a hectic Christmas in a restaurant doing budgets for next year and finished our mid year review. Very drained and low in energy. This week away was perfect as soon as we landed we were taken by bus to the palace, a beautiful building and amazing pool. Food is respectable for an all inc. option Drinks included but the mini bar in your room they only stock once a day and only give two beers! And soft drinks. Me and my partner were pretty much the youngest people there, Lots of older french golfers who were out during the day which meant less people around the pool. In jan the weather was around 22’c upto about 26’c so nice to lay by the pool. The pool itself was cold. Staff are nice and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2019,5,Great price & beautiful pool,"We came here in January for a bit of winter sun after a busy Christmas (we both work in hospitality) so we needed the break & this was the perfect place. Quick flight from London. Easy transfer. Hotel is beautiful. Weather was mild for time of year. Forecast would say 20-22 degrees, but felt like 24-25 in the sun. The communal areas really are vast. The lobby is palatial. There are several bars, but mainly the one in the lobby & the 2 by the pool were in use at this time of year. Food was good (I’ve stayed at a Riu in Mexico & there was much more choice, but they cater to Americans there). Enough choice, with meats & fish rotated throughout the week. A mixture of cuisines available with live cooking stations. I would have liked to have seen more Moroccan food though. It was the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2019,2,Due to travel here next week but mix up with room and poor customer service!,"I am due to travel to this hotel on the 6th July for ten nights. I booked directly with the hotel and paid extra for one of my two rooms to be a sea view room as this is very important to me. I never received a confirmation email from the hotel like stated. When I emailed them to confirm they stated that I did not have a sea view although I have paid extra for this. Carlos has been very unhelpful when dealing with this and after paying so much money overall, I am disappointed by the customer service and organisation of the hotel. Hopefully this issue will be resolved now I have involved management and I will update this review accordingly. However as it stands do not book directly with the hotel as it will be a nightmare and stay somewhere else if you want to get what you paid…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,Fabulous Hotel,"Just returned from a week at this hotel and missing it already . The hotel is well placed across from the beautiful beach in Agadir with easy access. The hotel is tastefully decorated throughout with the public areas having some extravagant accessories. The pool area is huge but very clean with plenty of high class sun beds and parasols. The pool staff are constantly on hand to help move beds, put up parasols. The rooms are large and comfortable. However what really made this hotel special in our view was the food and the staff. The staff in all bars and restaurants were courteous and helpful. The food is in our view was some of the best we have experienced in AI. Always hot with a good variety of choice even in the buffet restaurant. The a la carte restaurants were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,Holiday,Had a fabulous all inclusive weeks holiday. We booked through TUI which was easy. We flew from Manchester using the parking which was great. The service we received at the hotel was excellent. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. A previous reviewer mentioned how the hotel in places is a little jaded which it is it’s 8 years old with over 400 rooms so it will be due a revamp soon I’m sure. We found the hotel to be clean and the staff cleaning our room every day always did an excellent job. The grounds are beautiful. Pool side staff always help with finding you a sun lounger and parasol if required. We found the food to be excellent and there was plenty of choice for all tastes. We would return without a shadow of a doubt.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Once again from the moment we walked in to the hotel we were looked after, quick & easy check in great to see some friendly faces from our first stay. Our request of the same room was honoured. Weather amazing. The pool area is always well staffed and you never have to worry about anything here. Nothing is to much. Sun all day long anywhere around the pool. Food was exceptional last time, we were delighted to find it was even better this time. Very tasty so much choice you really can not complain.

We like to dine on the outside terrace and where looked after superbly by Redouan and Haamza,and the rest of the team. We had no problem getting sunbeds in the areas that we wanted to be in. The outside bar staff where very efficient in asking did we need drinks on the beds. A special mention to Issam, Ishmail and Hamid as well as the other bar staff . Many thanks for looking after us.

 June 2019,3,Not a place to have fun or take kids.,"Pros- Cleanliness- Very clean rooms, restaurant and hotel in general. Staff work very hard to ensure it stays clean around the clock. Food- Food is beautifully cooked and presented. But not a great deal of choice. But all in all, still good. Drinks- They'll make what ever drink you want. Drinks tastes nice and plenty of choice. Staff- Appear very polite and friendly. Cons- Entertainment- There isn't any. Well....not really. Same two guys evey single night playing the exact same songs in the exact same order....entertainment stage is like Morocco's got talent. Very very poor. Pool entertainment- None. I understand that this isnt a youthful entertainmening hotel with parties all day and night but surely they should have something. No music. No life. No atmosphere at…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I felt safe on this resort and was spoilt with the variety of food. Good range of cocktails and the entertainment was always fun! I particularly enjoyed the singer and pianist at the lobby bar. I would definitely return and I know it's one of the nicer hotels around. Only frustrating thing was some people were served a bottle of prosecco whilst others weren't.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Perfect Relaxing Holiday,We had a fabulous 10 days at the Riu Palace in May. Rooms are massive and so comfortable. We had to change rooms due to an ant problem but the staff handled it perfectly. We had great fun with the entertainment staff and left feeling like they were friends! Perfect location on the beach and about a 30 minute walk from the marina. The food in the hotel was to die for. Something different every night and full of flavour. The staff in the restaurant especially Youseff made our stay so special! Hotel is quiet in the evenings with not much going on past 11pm but that suited us just fine. All round a great holiday and was amazing value for money!!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,Wonderful Hotel - Highly recommend,"Myself and my boyfriend spent 7 nights at the RIU Tikidia Palace hotel in mid June this year, the weather was about 23-25 degrees with a wind and we sunbathed comfortably everyday but also swam in both the sea (as the hotel has a private section of the beach) and the pool. We got good tans, and did burn a little due to the wind being deceptive. We had the most wonderful stay, the hotel was clean, the staff were all polite, attentive and good at their jobs. There was a wide variety of things to do, we used the spa (the royal Hamam - body exfoliation, mask and massage. The massage was tame but i prefer to be pummeled and when i asked the masseuse she said it was meant to be relaxing one, so just be aware of this) and the entertainment facilities and i did the aqua aerobics --…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2019,5,Brilliant,"Had a great experience staying at this hotel. I stayed in a garden room which was very big, cleaned daily and the mini bar restocked regularly. The staff were friendly , helpful and nothing was too much trouble. I never had breakfast so I cannot comment however others in our party said they were fab. Lunch and evening meals, there was a lot of variety and something for everyone. With your meals you were served wine and the remainder of the bottle placed in a cooler on your table. The snack bar was open all afternoon. Drinks in the evening were served in “proper”glassware. Our party did not listen to the evening entertainment but other hotel guests seemed to enjoy this, I have nothing negative to say and I will almost definitely be returning.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The staff are just amazing, they will go the extra mile every time, no matter what you need, we were never pushed to tip, we felt it necessary as the service especially around dinner was just superb! in particular Moustapha and Brahim (apologies for incorrect spelling) made our holiday that much more special and they deserve so much more!

The food in the main restaurants and also the Krystal restaurant was amazing. The staff they were very very friendly which made our stay extra special and the dancers and leisure staff work really hard to keep you happy and entertained day and night . Although I would say the entertainment manager didn't make the same effort as the staff or compared to our experiences of other managers in other hotels. The pool area is very nice with a heated pool, activities daily and a good pool bar. I would really recommend this hotel and have already booked my return.

The decor and furnishings are in dark brown, beige, light brown and cream. Amazing ornaments but so dark. Come the morning, not as bad but think more cream and less dark brown would help. THE ROOMS Ours was amazing. So big, plenty of space around the bed. You step down into a living area with sofa, two chairs and a table. Patio doors led to a balcony with comfortable soft armchairs and a rattan table, very private. To the right was the town, to the left the beach and sea.

The hotel itself is amazing, our room was cleaned every day without fail and the rooms are massive too. Food is also very good, like your general all inclusive with lots to chose from and different things each night of the week. The cocktails and drinks are pretty strong but if you ask them they will give you a smaller measure - the lobby bar is open 24 hours too, we spent a few nights down there until 4/5am!!

Room allocated was excellent- on the fourth floor with fantastic views from our balcony. The room was very clean and the beds comfortable with freshly laundered linen. Bathroom towels could do to be refreshed as a bit hard and tired - the pool towels were much nicer. Pool areas busy and you need to get down quickly as towels were put on loungers and lots remained unused for hours. Maybe the staff could monitor unused beds and remove towels if they have been vacant for more than 2 hours. Lack of loos.

Only down Side is the entertainment at night time, is a little poor to say it’s 4* + apart from that all lovely and chilled time, after working hard at home.

I requested a high floor and our request was met. Overall I would say the hotel is a 4 star(but a very good 4 star), a few of the little things you would expect from 5 stars are missing, for example having the tables set and ready when you enter the dining room or having none chipped glasses etc. One thing I want to mention is the staff in the main restaurant area, if you tip you get treated like royalty if you don’t expect to be ignored and have to request drinks more than once during meals.

Loved the choice of local dishes especially the fish dishes. Pool and surrounding terraces were great apart from some cracks in the floor tiling and more toilets in the pool area would be useful.

The grounds are lovely and so well kept, staff at the hotel work really hard and you can see this in the results, everything is so well kept.

 June 2019,4,Wonderful stay,"Just returned from a weeks stay at this hotel. We had a fantastic time. Staff were friendly and helpful. Food had an excellent variety and was always hot. At breakfast the service could be slow especially filling up the empty buffet dishes. Drinks were what you would expect from an all inclusive in that part of the world. Plenty of sun beds round the pool however do expect to get up and get them in the morning! Even if you are not an early riser staff would still ensure that you were not left without a sunbed. The rooms were noisy, however mainly due to the noise of guests above and people being inconsiderate walking down the corridors! One gripe the beds are hard!

Room: Lovely and big for just two of us, we were bottom floor 1044- rooms were a little loud above us however because we were always late to the room of an night we didn’t hear any people walking past etc. BUGS because we were by the entrance of the corridor we had a lot of bugs in our room.

 May 2019,3,Poor junior management,"The hotel was expected. The staff and senior management, I feel, were let down by the junior management. 1) Guest allowed to enter the evening restaurant in shorts – at least three that I counted on different nights! 2) Chatting in groups whilst guests were looking for help in either a table or accompaniments such as water, wine, coffee and tea. 3) Allowing noisy guests to pollute the atmosphere with loud talking in the al la carte restaurants. We had other quiet nights but I believe other guests had walked out when a particularly large group (20 plus) were being noisy especially in font of small children who were well behaved.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Overall a good holiday,"We have stayed in the sister hotel to this in Marrakech and think that Agadir has much more to offer. As I write this review I'm sat in our room (baby is asleep) so rest assured, our opinions are fresh and reliable. To put it simply... Food is good. Not repetitive except for breakfast but there's plenty of choice. Allergens all labelled clearly. Staff very helpful, doting and well mannered. Staff are excellent with children. They are so polite. I have to disagree with the user who said that the staff will do anything for French people. They have been nothing short of superb with us as a young family of 3. Pool is great. A few wasps but not as bad as Marrakech! Plenty of sunbeds. People reserve this but c'est la vie. Just go down before breakfast - it is the done thing.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,1,Shame,"Visited may half term as a family of 4, 2 girls age 6 and 11. On arrival check in was great and food was still available in the main restaurant. Rooms are clean and spacious average family room. All areas in and out appear to be clean and tidy.... nothing special. Beds are uncomfortable Noise at night/through the night is dreadful I felt like i was sleeping in the middle of the m25! Room fridge only filled with soft drinks not beer like you would expect or a small bottle of wine. Drinks in the lunch diner were warm and quite frankly disgusting! Unless you tip the staff expect to be ignored! Food average nothing special and poor in comparison to other 5 stars we’ve stayed in! 1st and last time in Morocco, gutted were here for 2 weeks as 4 days in we’re ready for home!…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,2,Ok if you are French,Tables saved for French. Sun beds saved for French. Anything for French people. Been to this hotel many times but it has got so much worse over the years. Have now given up and moving on. Robinson hotel is good and the Dunas Goodbye Riu Palace,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Fantastic holiday,"Amazing holiday, food was plentiful with lots of choice cooked at a very high standard. I cannot wait to return. Staff are really friendly helpful. Rooms are clean and very spacious pool areas clean plenty of places to find a sun bed or just to relax around the pool bars",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,Good value,"We stayed here for 10 days and had a great holiday. Top tip, the day you arrive ask to book the other 2 restaurants as they get booked quickly, you can go once to each over a weeks stay. The menus are printed outside each of them, have a good read of them before you go as service is ridiculously rapid once you're seated. They make a nice change from the huge main dining room. The food is generally good in there but I'm sure many won't class it as real 5 star restaurant grade. This is a 444 room hotel and provides pretty good food considering the scale of this resort. Good idea to leave a pair of glasses or a hat on your table as it's often not clear if a table is still free, you may return with food to find you've lost your table. You will need to put towels out before…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,3,Expected a bit more,"We returned from our honeymoon last week, we decided to book here as we wanted a relatively cheap all inclusive in a country with good weather. Tui and the hotel knew it was our honeymoon but they did not make any attempt to make our stay more enjoyable, which was really disappointing. The only thing the hotel offered was for my husband to buy me some over priced flowers. Our week started with cloudy weather and it was actually quite cold, luckily the weather improved as the week went on. The food and staff were great and it didn't take long to get served at the bars. We thought the rooms felt a little dated and it felt like it hadn't been finished when we checked in as the bed was not fully made. Unfortunately we had some ants and a cockroach in our room. We had paid for a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,3,Mixed reviews,"Spent a week here. Some mixed reviews and thoughts. Overall, it is very clean and the housekeeping staff should be congratulated on this. I did have a problem in my room, 2026, an infestation of ants in the tea making area. I would find them inside the kettle, cups and in and around the trays. I had to clean and rinse everything when I wanted to make tea. I didn’t report it until I left as quite honestly, I don’t think there was much they would do. When I did report it I saw that nothing was tapped into their system, although I was ‘thanked’ for bringing it to their attention. The reception staff were very happy and amusing, although my friend requested beer in his fridge, which they informed was included, it took three days of complaining before the request was carried…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Fantastic,"Well people, this hotel has all the conditions for a great break.we just come back and we love it. Good things first, rooms are very big and confortable with room clean every day and towels and fridge stock up.wifi is fantastic even on the beach works , all drinks serve to costumers are genuinely the real brand not local ones,the waiters they work hard and if you tip them they will get all your drinks even on the pool area.the reception staff were very helpful nothing is to much for them. Now the needs improvement area, the beach area no drinks for guest and the sun beds not comfortable,the selection of food needs to have more seafood variety very little fish being served special morocco have so much and good quality,so the food is average in my opinion and have travel a lot…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,Very good hotel!,"My two friends and I have just returned from a week at the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. Highly recommend it to everyone. Singles, couples, family with children. We only had one issue whilst there which I will go into later. The hotel itself was fabulous. The grounds were well kept, the pool was very clean and massive, though slightly cold, but you warm up pretty quickly. The staff were lovely and couldn't do enough for you. Special mention to Brahim in the lunch buffet restaurant. His service was top notch and nothing was too much trouble for him. Also wish to mention our waiter in the main restaurant, his name begins with Z but I cant remember what it was. If the hotel know who I am talking about please pass on our compliments to him again for his outstanding…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2019,4,Very good apart from,"We had two rooms in the ground floor, both very comfortable and great access to the pool and beach. We had a problem when we could not get into our room, four trips to reception later after them issuing new keys, questioning if I had card next to phone etc.....they sent a handyman down, then someone else who realised the door needed a new battery. There was also a problem with unwanted insects in our other room but the housekeeping staff and manager were involved. Apart from this, the hotel is great, the food was brilliant for all inclusive, the pool area is great, no problems with sun beds, Pool staff very helpful. Every evening we went for a walk and our favourite person was Omar on the front door, he was always smiling, helpful and pleasant. We would definitely go back.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Second time and still as good!,"This was our 2nd time at the hotel, and just as good as we remembered. Food is excellent, especially in the Krystal restaurant. Staff amazing. We were recognised by one of the waiters on our first night, who brought an ice bucket with a bottle of prosecco and cold beers to our table , as well as throwing rose petals on the table ...and a bottle of red wine. A bit of sea mist for the first 3 days, but after that hot, hot, hot! I even went in the pool which is rare for me. Good fun dance in the pool after the exercise classes too. We didn't watch the shows as we prefer to eat late, so it was the low key piano bar for us which we enjoyed. Hotel is 24 hour all inclusive in the main bar area. Mini bar in bedroom which they fill with pop and water and beers if requested. The promenade…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Excellent hotel,"Fab hotel, this was our 4th visit and every visit never fails to impress us. Rooms are spacious and kept very clean, tea & coffee facilities and water and soft drinks replenished often, also free safety deposit box. Meals are excellent, and all staff can’t do enough for you, tables are cleared extremely quickly, and there are always plenty of staff on hand to help. We’ve never had a problem getting a sun bed, or umbrella, pool is very cold though, there is an indoor pool but this wasn’t very warm so I was alittle disappointed. They usually have a special offer on in the beauty spa, we had a while in the steam room then a 50 min massage for £30 which is an extremely good price for a hotel. My only gripe would be the entertainment, it’s not brilliant, and would expect better…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Amazing!,"This hotel is fantastic. We have just left after finishing a relaxing week here in the Palace. The hotel is beautiful and all the staff are of amazing credit to it. The rooms are spacious and has everything you need from a hotel room, a couch a coffee table a table and chairs. Tea and coffee facilities and a well stocked up minibar. Along with a balcony which we had stunning views from. The maids kept the rooms looking fresh and did some brilliant art with the sheets and pillows. The pool area was relaxing with an aqua gym every day which many people seemed to join in on. The swim up bar was open when we visited and the bar staff attended to people in order. The area was kept to high standards with gardens and the gardeners working hard. The restaurants were good and the food…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Excellent,just returned from our 4th visit to this hotel arrived late at night staff waiting with a welcome drink very fast check in and food waiting in the dineing room some of the staff remembered us from previos visits and greeted us as old friends the only down side age old problem people putting towels on sun beds at silly oclock then not returning untill lunch time that said the pool staff were very good at getting loungers and puting them together for you the room immaculate food very good all in all A* for anyone thinking of going to Agadir this hotel is a must,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2019,5,Elegant and family friendly Hotel,"We went as a family of parents, grandparents and twin toddlers and l can honestly say we were all well catered . The rooms were large and stylish with lots of wardrobe space a lounge area and balcony . Everything was absolutely spotless.The Hotel is on the beach with its own private section but we stayed mostly in the hotel for sunbathing .There were many interesting spaces to sunbathe but if you wanted to bag one of the Pergolas you really did have to get up early to nab them. The pools are lovely and clean but not heated so were a little cold when we went in April. The daily aqua aerobics was fun to watch! The food selection is fantastic,from Morrocan to Japanese its all buffet style and the main dining room is huge so a little noisy .if you wanted a quieter restaurant there…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Excellent,Excellent hotel with professional friendly staff. Very clean through. Extensive variety of food and the 2 a la carte restaurants are lovely but you do need to book very early into your holiday. Only downside was storage in rooms with 3 adults sharing this was very limited.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,"Really Good, very friendly staff, immaculately clean","We arrived late at night as part of a big coach. Staff were waiting with welcome drinks and the staff checked in 2 coach loads of guests in very quick time. Luggage porter was a very abrupt as we hadn't purchased local currency yet and had been using contactless payment since we left the UK. The room was very spacious, 2 single beds pushed together was less than ideal, but not a problem. Room was immaculate and cleaned very well each day. Only slight drawback was our balcony was over an alleyway, so not very appealing. That being said, you don't travel all that way to spend your whole holiday on the balcony, so a fairly minor point all in all. Food was really nice each day, but much of it was the same, only changing a few dishes each day with the same side dishes. We…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Entertainment,"The Animation Team were amazing and sooo friendly! We had the best time watching them dance and they even stayed in contact with us when we left! We spoke to the animation team everyday without fail and could not fault them TabTab was so lovely and a brilliant dancer, made our stay even better🙂",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Just what I needed!,"We had a very warm welcome on arrival and were quickly checked in and shown our room. The hotel itself was stunning! Very stylish. The service in the restaurants was excellent and the variety of food was brilliant which suits me as I am quite a fussy eater. I loved that sparkling wine was included in the All inclusive! A lot of hotels expect you to pay extra. The entertainment staff were extremely friendly and always popped over for a chat during the day and again in the evening to make sure you were having a good time. I would especially like to thank TabTab and Khalid from the entertainment team for making our time at the hotel wonderful. Such lovely lads, very chatty, respectful and good fun. I will definitely be returning!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2019,4,Great One Week Stay,"Check in - was friendly and quick with a nice welcome drink, just short form to complete and given keys and map of the resort. Room - spacious and clean and plenty of storage. The beds were two singles pushed together but were extremely comfortable and large. There were two seating areas (table and chairs and sofa with coffee table) and spacious balcony. Plenty of storage including three hanging areas and drawers. Free to use safe, tea and coffee facilities and fully stocked mini bar. Bathroom was spacious complete with hairdryer, bath and shower and a range of toiletries (the only downside for me was it is quite dark in the bath/shower area). Food - can not fault the food and there was a varied choice. Breakfast and Dinner are taken in the main restaurant - never had a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2019,1,ABUSED MY MANAGER,"I have been to this hotel in 2017 and we had a wonderful time there when ALBERTO was the manager. We went again in April 2019 and A assistant manager called KHALIL verbally abused me and my daughter in front of my 3 year old grandson. I was shocked that a manager of a five star hotel could speak in that disgusting way, I ask staff and security to call the police and they laughed and refused to call the police or give the number. I was horrified and so scared that I couldn’t wait to get of to UK. I also contacted the director and he ignored my email. I then reported it to the TIU rep who also advised not to call the police as she isn’t protected in Morocco. I saw reviews on here that people had witnessed this incident but they were all taken down by trip adviser for some strange…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,Great even during Ramadan,"We are still currently here at the hotel but just wanted to leave a review . We were really worried when we realised we had booked to come during the Month of Ramadan. People said it will be horrid, the staff will be miserable, you will not be served alcohol. Well.. it’s all rubbish! Staff are fabulous, ready for a laugh, friendly, helpful. It must be so hard for staff serving food and drink all day and all in the heat. So don’t have any worries about coming during Ramadan you are guaranteed a warm and friendly welcome and excellent service.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,5,Fantastic week,"Fantastic hotel.hardworking staff all very helpful. Food was excellent especially the freshly cooked pancakes and doughnuts at breakfast. Lots of food to choose from at dinner with a choice of a bottle of red,white or rose wine to choose from. Our only problem was we should of stayed for two weeks instead of one. It was a very enjoyable and relaxing holiday and can’t wait to go back.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,Finishing touches,"We have just returned from a week at the hotel for our honeymoon, first impressions of the hotel were wow! The lobby and bar are really lovely and we were all given a welcome drink as we waited to check in. We had been upgraded to a suite and whilst the actual room is a little dated, the bathroom was lovely. Only negative was that our balcony was never cleaned and was rather covered in bird poo (didn’t want to complain as didn’t want to sit out anyway due to risk of being poo’d on). Completely agree with other comments that finishing touches are lacking - no iron or ironing board, the iron from reception was decent but the ironing board was old and rickety and we ended up having to use the floor and had to wait a considerable time to be able to use them. Wardrobes could also use…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,Excellent hotel,"Only a visitor for a day but this is a really vibrant hotel. Lovely pool and snack areas and a really nice dining room. Currently staying at another Tikida hotel in Agadir but in future I will probably stay here. Location is really good and, although no golf, I would rather travel to the golf on a daily basis.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Beautiful hotel,"Returned from here yesterday, beautiful hotel the staff are lovely, so friendly and helpful. Couldn’t fault the TUI reps atall they were so helpful, full of knowledge about surrounding areas and gave us Great tips! Food is good, hot and lots of choice. It does get a bit repetitive but there is so much choice! My partner is quite a fussy Eater and did always find something to eat! Pools are lovely and very refreshing, indoor pool is great for the days you’ve had too much sun! Rooms are absolutely stunning! Mini bar gets topped up daily and I find if you leave a little tip in the fridge for the drinks man you do get that little added extra! Iron is available on request was worried as other reviews said they couldn’t get one but we managed it on first day! Don’t listen to reviews…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2019,4,Nice hotel but lacks eye for detail to make a true 5 star,"The positives are many - staff attentive and service generally good. The rooms are cleaned to a good standard and the food is excellent including the two dedicated restaurants. Outside areas are pleasant and the pool area is nice with plenty of loungers for guests. On the negative - the hotel is looking tired in areas, the gym is poorly stocked with equipment. Our room overlooked the pool area and I feel it needed refurbishment. The buffet area was sometimes chaotic with staff seating guests but then allowing others to stroll in and choose their own tables. Some tables were not set or been cleared when you were seated with missing cutlery etc. I would still recommend the hotel but feel that some investment is required in the short term.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,Lovely hotel,"So firstly the only reason I haven't given this a five star is down to the spa. Whilst I appreciate it is not owned by the hotel, unfortunately it doesn't have a separate page do I have to comment here. Please leave any jewelry in your room or a locker before you have a treatment, the lady took my necklace off to do a massage and it was never seen again, spa manager really unhelpful, said she has called security to search the girls but never asked what it looked like so not sure how they were going to know what they were looking for! Spent half a day trying to report it to the police who don't speak English and after being passed around stations I gave up..the manageress said she would get me a crime number, but guess what... nothing, absolutely disgusting service. Ok back to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,4,5 star food for an all inclusive,"Firstly we were really worried about coming here due to the reviews we had read. We have 3 days left out of 11 and yes it’s not perfect but we have thoroughly enjoyed this break. ROOMS... Large, fab bathroom, comfy beds, quilts a bit heavy and too warm . Lights not bright and decor in whole room and hotel very dark. Rooms cleaned to a high standard daily. Large bottles of water in your room. Not many plug points and bring your own hairdryer as theirs aren’t powerful. TRIPS... Went to welcome meeting, nice guys and informative. Booked 2 trips, yes more expensive than booking outside hotel but the reassurance we would be safe and brought back was worth it. FOOD... very good, yes it’s repetitive but choose something different each day . There is a lot of choice and of a high…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,1,Not what it appears!,"So where to start... First of all we are not the sort of people to complain we regularly travel through North Africa and the Middle East love the culture and are used to the way of things however on this occasion we went away for my Birthday to this hotel... We booked a 5 star hotel And unfortunatley this is not what I would say it is. It lacks something, the eye for detail maybe we were repeatedly given drinks with dead wasps floating in them, dirty cutlery on multiple occasions throughout our trip, we were served raw chicken, raw fish and a few part cooked burgers in their restaurants. Then I got sick in the middle of the night definitely from the food without all the details it was not pleasant, this meant I missed a trip the next day we phoned the Tui helpline from the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,3,2nd visit but not as good,We came 4 years ago at new year and had an absolutely wonderful time so when we needed to R&R this was the first place we looked at booking. We recommended to friends and family all of which then came also Since then in places some decorating needs to be done - upgrading of worn areas and dirty sunbeds and the room did smell musty with dim lighting and damp even though on the ground floor where it should have been light and and agree with the other reviewer that the mini bar was only filled half way through the week on anything bar water. Many of the waiters were brilliant and really friendly but some were surly and slammed drinks down on the bar for you to have to extend to get them so between this and the room we were a little disappointed. We booked the restaurant one…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2019,3,Poor Service,"Second time to Agadir and thought as we had stayed in so many Riu Palace Hotels across the world, this would be of the same excellent service. How wrong were we.. Checked in and were told our bags would be in our room within 30 minutes. As we were on the same floor as the reception we offered to take our own, staff insisted on taking them. We had to wait 3 hours for them to arrive in our room. And then the porter was rude and demanding his tip. He got strong words of advice. It’s advertised as having a fully stocked mini bar. Not true. Two cans of coke. We have now complained to staff 7 times and are still waiting for it to be stocked. Having stayed in other Palace hotels this one is far below the Riu standard we expect. Don’t have specialist restaurants advertised when only…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I'm comparing this to recent 5* hotels I've stopped in (sensatori & Royalton) Hotel - The hotel and the grounds are fantastic typical of the big resort hotels, grand entrance with views at the end looking over the grounds. the pool areas and the animation areas around the pool are OK, the tiles had come up and was being concreted when we was there which didn't fit in with the rest of the tiles. Gym - Massive gym not much equipment though needs to offer more free weights and benches. Staff - All of the staff are excellent and the hotel should take great credit for this absolutely top stuff.

Food is excellent with copious choices at all servings. Plenty of sun loungers and parasols, no need to save a bed before breakfast.

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and management of the hotel in true Moroccan and Riu fashion. This destination is tip top.

Every member smiled back if you looked at them. The grounds were beautifully maintained. The hotel itself was beautiful. Would like to mention Abdullah who was the porter. Brilliant and very helpful. Food was very boring and repetitive, but catered for every palate. Entertainment was not great. ONLY 1 SOCKET in the room guys so take multi socket converters. They are a bit clueless on how to make even the simplest of cocktails. But you can stick to the normal spirits. Wine selection was good.

 April 2019,5,Family holiday,I took my 3 children and their partners to this hotel. My main concern was whether all 8 of us would be able to eat together and get sunbeds near each other. I need not have worried. Every day they found us a table for 8 at lunch and evening time. Sunbeds were not a problem. The staff could not do enough for us. They were friendly and always keen to help.

Not too noisy and the room was very spacious and clean. The rooms are poorly lit which we struggled with in the evenings and it would have been nice to have some beer in the mini bar although the staff provided us with some on request towards the end of our stay. The beds are comfortable and the rainfall shower is a nice touch. Restaurants : The main buffet restaurant has a huge variety of food (something for everyone) and it is always well stocked even if you're visiting ten minutes before they are due to close.

 April 2019,4,Easter break,"Overall we had a great holiday. Check in was smooth and swift. Unfortunately we had to change our room due to noise above us, would recommend requesting floor 4. Food was varied and good quality, however became repetitive after a week. Pool area was pleasant apart from noise of concrete drills installing pool side showers for a few hours over 2 days. Service was good/great and not over familiar - professional at all times. Lobby area of hotel was huge with a relaxing atmosphere and tasteful decor. Beds could do with being slightly softer!

 April 2019,4,"very good , not fantastic","Overall the hotel is very good with a luxurious feel to the main areas , pool , large lobby etc.The rooms are generously sized , and well serviced .The main buffet restaurant is very good , but becomes a bit repetitive as the week goes on, and everything is sweet, Moroccans have a very sweet tongue.Service was excellent in the bars, restaurant and around the pool with a constant supply of branded drinks on supply,the entertainment was fairly basic, how much dancing can you watch..?,AS for 5* , well its not the Savoy,but a good resort hotel, we paid for a late check out which was £50 , a bit steep for 5 hours I think.

 April 2019,4,Rui palace Agadir,"Myself and my wife took a short break without our kids and was overall happy with our hotel, after having a walk about of an evening and seeing other hotels in the area I can safely say it’s the best hotel in Agadir. From cleaners to management the staff were friendly. Only slight complaint was the fact all men had to wear trousers of an evening which bugged me as it was poorly advertised and that some women were able to wear very little while men had to suffer the heat in trousers to me it didn’t make sense. If you bring your kids beware that evening entertainment doesn’t start until 9:30pm. A little late if you have young kids. Also after experiencing the amount of hassle you get outside the hotel and that most men made my wife feel uncomfortable while walking out of an…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Rooms are pretty good.( we moved rooms after 2 nights as were too close to the entertainment..not good for sleep with maxey!) We were unlucky with the weather tbf as it was too windy. Indoor pool is a good addition to facilities. Gym is fine..a little basic but fine. Kids club is fine. Agadir as an area is basic. The beach is nice. It is vast. A lot of people comment on cheapy cheapy men but they are no problem. The tortoises in hotel grounds are cool. Lunch is good but only in one location. They show premier league football in the hotel.

 April 2019,5,Lovely hotel,"Very smart hotel. A little too much dark wood in the rooms for my taste but public areas very luxurious. Room cleaned well. Pool area not clean! Static beds with stone surrounds not wiped down or swept around for the whole of our stay. Food, drink and service really good. Entertainment poor. We have stayed in many all inclusive hotels and this was amongst the best. Not much to do or see in Agadir, but if you want a sunny week by the pool this hits the mark.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2019,2,Not 5* & not good customer service,"We booked a junior or standard suite for yourselves and our 10 year old daughter and arrived at 9pm to find a spectacular looking hotel and reception. Quick check in and up to our room only to find that our view is of the car park and hotel next door not what I would have expected from a suite. Popped down to the restaurant for a snack and back to the room to get the little one some sleep, only to find that they are holding a festival in the car park which lasted until 1 am with deep bass music. When I went to reception to ask them what it was all about I was told that it’s always on every weekend and that’s just how it is and that there were no spare rooms to move to. Funny enough though the next morning there were spare rooms at the end of the hotel if I wanted to pay to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2019,4,Pros and Cons,"Pro Food was excellent apart from last meal in Krystal where the beef was impossible to cut and therefore inedible. Desserts were stand out- tasted as good as they looked Pool area was pleasant with plenty of comfortable sun beds Staff were generally friendly and helpful but not intrusive Rooms were very clean Con Rooms were very dated and there was a musty smell. Beds were rather hard Dining room staff were over worked and tables not always set and drinks service erratic Evening entertainment was generally very poor- the shows were very amateurish, possibly as they were performed by animation staff who were not trained performers and had been working all day. Probably would not class as 5 star due to dated rooms and general lack of upkeep",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 April 2019,4,Beautiful Hotel,"We recently stayed for the second time at this hotel and I simply cannot fault anything with the hotel. We were originally given a rubbish room despite emailing in advance as it was our 25th wedding anniversary. The first room didn’t not have a view except of bushes we couldn’t see over. Smelt badly of sewerage and we could hear a generator throughout the night. A room close to where we had requested was available the next day and we were able to change. This was sorted out with amazing efficiency. The staff are amazing as are the food, facilities and cleanliness. The hotel is also great if you are a runner, the promenade both ways is great for running. My only dislike this time was the amount of children.

 March 2019,3,Great staff - very disappointing food,"Booked to stay here for 7 nights 21st to 28th March, it has been about 3 and a half years since we last stayed here and we were looking forward to our return visit. In general the hotel did live up to our expectations, however that were some disappointments, which are highlighted in the review. Sadly the Hotel, was very nice and we enjoyed our stay, but it does not warrant being called a ""Palace"", hence the average rating. Due to the fact the hotel is built on a hill, guests enter the hotel on the 3rd floor, where Reception and the massive lobby and the 24 hour lobby bar are located. Our room was on the fourth, top, floor, one floor up from reception, we had a view of the pool, gardens and out to sea. Our room was clean and comfortable and was equipped with a safe,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2019,3,"Clean hotel, nice staff but boring","ROOM - Room was cleaned daily, it was in good condition and bed was comfy. Our hairdryer and kettle didn't work but they fixed it by the next day. Shower was amazing, bath products that supplied were simple so nothing to shout about. Plug socket is far away from the bed on one side so if you both want to charge your phones overnight then bring an extra long lead :) Our balcony was facing the outside so we didn't use it but other rooms had nicer views. Blackout curtains so you can sleep the night AND day away! POOL - Both pools were very cold (April) and the swim up bar wasn't staffed. The wind from the sea keeps everything cool but it was warm enough most of the time to sit out in all day and get a tan. FOOD - as expected from an all inclusive. If you're a picky eater I'm sure…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

From the moment we arrived to the second we stepped out of the hotel, we were always well looked after and greeted with a smile. The staff are super unfriendly and always ready to help. The food... We couldn't get enough of the buffets. It was great that we had so much choice and daily variety, from breakfast to dinner. We spent the majority of our time poolside, always with a drink in hand. Whenever we returned to our room, it was beautifully made up and clean. The only ""negative"" we had was our room key going crazy twice during our stay but that's a minor inconvenience and certainly not enough to ruin the amazing time we had.

 March 2019,4,Great food and lots of laughs,"We stayed for a week at the end of March and have to say we were delighted with the food and drink in this pretty hotel. We especially liked our meal in the Fusion fine dining restaurant, the staff were lovely there. Our pool facing room was bigger than expected which was a nice but the bed was like rock and took some getting used to. Also if you are a light sleeper you will struggle as people wander back to their rooms at all times of the night talking loudly and the sound of banging doors was a pain so very glad we took earplugs. What did made our holiday was the entertainment from the animation team, loved watching them dance after the aqua fit class in the morning and the evening entertainment - such talented guys with so much energy.

Rooms: Rooms are very spacious and consist of a massive 8ft bed which was comfortable with additional pillows if required. The TV doesn't have many English channels but then again we don't go on holiday to sit and watch TV. Bathroom is spacious with his and her sinks and a flat head shower over the bath. Safty deposit box in room. Mini fridge included in room with water and soft drinks which are refilled regular.

 March 2019,3,Mixed reviews from us,"My husband and I spent 4 nights in an 5 star all inclusive in Marrakesh before we came here for 5 nights. We wanted a city and beach holiday so decided to do both. When we arrived to this hotel we noticed the food tasted noticeably cheaper and the lunch time restaurant was tacky inside and very messy. The hotel grounds are lovely and well maintained. The staff are friendly. Our room was really big but had a musty smell and the bed linen was old and tatty. We complained to reception and they got a cleaner to clean the floor with citrus, however this only masked the smell for an hour or so. The smell is all through the hotel corridors. I then emailed the reception as it was hard work explaining the issue the first time! The next day they left note asking us to to reception. They…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2019,5,This hotel is superb - cannot fault it!,"We have just returned from a week at this hotel and absolutely loved it. We were all a little sceptical as this was our first trip to Morocco but this hotel is 5 star. The food is superb, the beach is lovely and clean as is the hotel. The staff are constantly cleaning and are so polite. The swimming pool is large and there are plenty of lovely sunbeds. It really is all inclusive and you can get something to eat and drink from 7.00 in the morning until 11.00 at night. The rooms were spacious and very well equipped. There is a kettle in the room for tea and coffee and the mini bar is topped up every day at no cost to the guest - soft drinks only but beer and spirits are available all day at any of the bars around the hotel.

 March 2019,5,Ninth visit - consistently good,"I’m not a fan of hotel entertainment personally, it’s nice to hear some live music while you’re having a few drinks in the bar before supper. Historically I’ve always found the entertainment in the hotel to be average to poor and for most of this week, it’s been quite frankly awful! Hence my focus in this review - I don’t know if it’s a one off or if the hotel is rotating the musicians on a weekly basis, but this singer / pianist group are the best we’ve experienced at this hotel in eight years.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2019,5,Second time around even better this time,"Just got back from a week stay, can't believe the service as got better we came last year around the same time and I fell in love with the place again ,the service is fantastic Iam sure if you dropped a knife or fork in restaurant it would hit the waiter on the back of the head ,the service is that good the food was even better this time the maid kept the room spotless the weather was good just a hour rain all week , will be back next year for sure may be sooner",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2019,5,Much needed break,"Just returned from a 10 night break from what we think is the best hotel we’ve ever stayed at. The food from all restaurants is exceptional. The quality from the drinks package is remarkable. Top branded spirits ( though the local gin & rum are more than fine ). We stayed on the ground floor room 1100 which was very spacious with an eight foot wide bed!! Bathroom was huge with twin basins. Maid did a thorough job everyday. All the staff without exception were great but from our personal experience a mention must go Breheim in the main buffet restaurant, a lovely attentive young man. Karim in main bar, always very polite and very efficient. Abdelatife in lunchtime & Moroccan restaurant, always smiling, always so well mannered and very professional. Lastly, a mention about the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,The best all inclusive hotel we have ever stayed in,Let me start the review by saying I'm not a fan of all inclusive hotels. I'm not keen on the normally bland all you can eat in one go buffets or the cheap spirits and beers. This hotel however has potentially changed my mind. The buffet food was very tasty and the pre dinner shows on the theme evenings were great. The buffet was actually better than the 2 a la carte restaurants (where the staff just seem to hover for tips before they let you leave). However the staff generally were very good and all spoke excellent English. The hotel is well located for a 15 - 20 min walkalong the sea front to the harbour or 20 mins to the other end of the promenade. If its any sort of recommendatiion we will be going back later this year (a first for me in an all inclusive hotel!),Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2019,4,"Wonderful service and delicious food, very average rooms","Pros: the STAFF are incredible! So nice, always smiling. Hassan Dref at lunch is so kind and attentive, even remembering what coffees we always get. Mohammed at dinner is great, Said at the towel stand is also so nice. The food is amazing too - kudos to the chefs and kitchen for cooking up so variety every night for so many people! Pools also very beautiful. Suafyane at the front desk was so kind - we had a bad experience with a taxi upon arrival and were not in a good mode, and he cheered us up immediately. Cons: the rooms are average, old looking and musky-smelling. House keeping is either not good enough or understaffed - we accidentally spilled wine but it was not cleaned up, the shampoo was consistently empty, and our cosmetics seemed to be thrown around. Room seemed to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2019,5,What a beautiful place,Last day of our holiday. Our week here at The Riu Palace Tikida in Agadir was a really great one. Staff are so friendly can’t do enough for you.

Rooms are spacious with adequate storage space, a safe, coffeemaker, TV with French, English, German etc. programs.

 February 2019,4,Not the best Riu Palace,We have stayed in many RIU Palace hotels which offer superior services and rooms the the standard hotels. The food at this hotel was ok but again not as good as at other Palace hotels. The service on t6he other hand was to quick they took your plate away the moment you finished. We had a suite with a view across to the sea which was great. It had a great big TV in the middle of the room but not much English tv so I plugged in my iPhone and watched Netflix. The toilets had the worst hand driers. You could see everybody coming out of the toilets doing a little dance shaking there hands.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Great service and a bottle of wine at the table brought to you - nice. Many choices and delicious food. We stayed for 2 weeks and even though we had said (before) that we would eat out away sometimes, we didn’t in the end because this hotel’s food/service is better than what’s on offer outside “a la carte” - totally aside from the fact that we were “all inclusive” and eating at the Riu TP was no additional cost. There are a few restaurants nearby on the right that are trying to be “trendy” and they are not as nice as the Riu.

Unfortunately there was a shower over bath which my wife was not able to access because of mobility problems. Reception said that they would have a walk in shower room available but would not be ready for an hour or so. About 6pm we were given the room. We took our own luggage to the room. The room had a sewerage smell. I tried to use the aircon to shift the smell but the aircon flow was almost non-existent.

The room was lovely, spacious and clean and there were several English TV channels should you need them. We were on a ground floor room facing the pool which was fine for us as we don't use the balcony a lot. The only thing I would have preferred - as it is a 5* hotel - is that if you would like beer in the mini bar, that you can leave an indicator for this in the room. As my Mum has mobility problems, although it's on varying levels the hotel seemed to accommodate with ramps, lifts etc. and so I had no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my Mum and Dad.

I would especially just like to mention the entertainment team who made us feel so comfortable and at home (Khalid, Tab Tab, Jalal and Rasheed). Positives: - Weather was perfect around 27 degrees, definitely a good time to visit. - Customer service was very impressive, would be the main reason I would go back. - Location was great, about a 30 minute walk to Agadir Harbour.

 March 2019,5,A week of sheer relaxation,"Usually when you get to a hotel you’re slightly disappointed but this was exactly how I imagined and more. The bedroom was spacious for my friend and I, and very clean. The staff were all so helpful and lovely, especially if you’ve tipped! And I would say that’s my biggest tip- for instance other reviews have moaned about the sun loungers- we never had a problem. We tipped on the first day (like everyone appears to) so a lounger is waiting for you the next day, even if that’s after a much needed lie in. We also really enjoyed talking with the entertainment guys- big shout out to Taptap who made us laugh every day. The food was great, although I’d probably want more choice after a week, but the wine was fine. I never go back to the same hotel but this maybe an exception.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

This really gives me the hump... this is Complete rubbish, our daughter had a milk and soya allergy. We explained this to the hotel. They wrote us a card in both French and Arabic. The waiting staff and even more particularly chefs took it seriously even when we didn't carry the card. This is the main reason we returned for the second time. 2) feeling uncomfortable outside the hotel because of locals. Wow..local people, how dare they!!!

Tip the pool attendants and you will get the best beds daily. Pool bar not in use. Hotel isn’t directly on the beach as stated! You have to cross a public promenade that is full of local lucky lucky men, they do grab you and try to place bracelets, watches, cream etc on you! Just be firm and say no! They do move when the armed police walk their way!. We went out for a walk at the front of the hotel! Looked around some shops. Walked down a street next to our hotel to get back and came across locals injecting themselves!…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,5,Rui palace tikida Agadir,"Lovely hotel situated right on the beach , rooms spacious and clean with a Monsoon shower head always red hot . Weather was a bit of hit and miss , early morning mist of mountain lingering until dinner time sometimes it dint warm up till 3pm , so pool was cold till then , indoor pool sorted this problem out , animation team always polite especially yousef (yo yo ) top guy , always talking to guest .Buffet restaurant you can wear shorts at night time marawan (think that’s his name ) always saved us a table in buffet area every night with complimentary ice bucket filled with beers and wine 🍷 .went to souk market wow an experience !!!

 February 2019,5,Standard of Staff & Service Exceptional,"First time visit to Morocco and over 10 yrs since we've done a package holiday. Booked with 1st Choice and picked this hotel mainly due to the reviews and they're not wrong. Service and standard of staff is 2nd to none. Special thanks to Sana on reception, you are a little diamond, nothing was ever too much trouble and your help and suggestions made our holiday even more special. Sorry my husband did not want any fuss for his birthday, which you spotted straight away on check-in, but arranging flowers for the room was a lovely gesture and much appreciated. All staff were friendly and accommodating, even the maids said hello and gave you a smile. The hotel was fine, some folk might not like the dark decor of some of the areas but hey, if that's all you can complain about......…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Perfect perfect perfect,Lovely place lovely staff everything about it was perfect. I dreaded booking all inclusive never do it as I like variety but it was a week in Agadir so I just went for it. The food variety and quality was excellent. Happy staff make a big difference! Everyone in the family felt the same (teenage girls). Don’t hesitate if your thinking of going there just don’t tell everybody as if they get too much demand the price will go up !!!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2019,5,Ideal situation and the staff could not be more helpful.,Excellent situation for the hotel right on the beach and a nice stroll along the promenade to the town centre. The staff made the stay most comfortable and could not do enough for us. The food is excellent and with such a choice at every meal I am sure we all put on a few pounds. All thing considered we had an excellent holiday and were very well looked after. Thank you all.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,2nd Trip to celebrate my Birthday and such an amazing time had by all,We first visited the hotel in May 2018 as a couple and enjoyed it so much we went back on February 21st with our Boys and the eldests Girlfriend to celebrate my birthday. From check in to leaving all the staff were brilliant with some even recognizing us from last year. Nothing is too much trouble and always with a smile. The food in the buffet is plentiful with lots of choice and this time we tried both Al la Carte restaurants and these were very good. We don't normally go back to the same resorrts multiple times but we wil definately be returning to this one. A massive thank you to everyone and keep up the good work,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Weeks Stay Feb 2019,"Had a great week here last two weeks. Hotel was luxurious in its fixtures and fittings. The rooms were spacious exceptionally clean and well equipped. Wifi was fast and no problem whilst there. The food was good we eat in both the a la carte and main restaurants and both were good. The service in the dining rooms was fantastic. The staff are something else, attentive, courteous, helpful and fun. This was across all departments housekeeping, bars, pool and security. The Security guys were really good and helpful. The only petty issue was the sun lounger brigade reserving beds before the pool area even open and not returning to them until lunch or not even using. A sad practice but not managed by the hotel management at all.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,3,Huge hotel but poor service,"My husband and I returned from our holiday last week in Rui palace TIkida Agadir which we booked through TUI When we booked the holiday and also when we checked in,we were not advised there were steps in the room which we didn’t notice upon entering the room due to poor lighting and which then resulted in my partner and I falling. I actually injured myself and the hotel didn’t really seem to care as the reception staff were unhelpful. The hotel should warn guests there are steps in the room and improve lighting. On the last day of the holiday we noticed the sink in the bathroom was covered with ants. The hotel was so not helpful that we had to report it three time before they actually came to the room to resolve the problem. My husband and I travel on a regular basis so I…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,The staff make this hotel amazing,"This was my second stay at the fantastic Riu Tikida Palace. This time our party included a baby and a lady using a mobility scooter. The hotel is truly child and mobility friendly - the staff could not have been more patient or willing to help. Everything about this hotel is fantastic but by far the best thing is the staff! Everyone was so helpful and friendly. Even in the face of some of the rudeness towards staff that we witnessed, they remained smiling and polite. Special thanks to Mustapha in the restaurants and Abdeiiazan (hope I spelt it right) at the lobby bar for looking after us :) Speaking of bars and restaurants, the drinks were plentiful and the choice was amazing. We worked our way through the cocktail list and can recommend them all. We did not visit any of the al…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,4,Beautiful hotel,"We arrived 23rd February 2019 and we were really pleased with hotel, reception staff were pleasant and quick check in. Porter took our luggage to the room and again we were pleased with the room. Spacious, clean and plenty of room for 2 adults and 1 child, in fact more than big enough. I’m going to get the bad things out of the way first. The food is not 5*, we have been to many 4* and had much better selection and quality. The meats were dry and choice was poor although we did always find something, we didn’t feel it deserved a 5* rating. The staff were always fantastic but the food was disappointing, we are food people and this hotel was a let down for food. The entertainment was also poor and to be honest was more like 3*, although they worked hard and very long hours, it…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Fabulous break,"spent 5 days in the Rui palace Hotel Agadir. We were looking for a February half term break with guaranteed sun which wasn't going to break the bank! Hotel lovely, all the staff very attentive and polite, buffet food excellent choice. I have 3 children 16,14 and 12 yrs and it was the perfect break - I think for us 5 days was long enough as we had made the decision that we wouldn't go on any excursions although they were offered.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Super friendly staff,"This was our second holiday to Agadir and returned to the same hotel as we were really impressed the first time. Second time around - just the same! Checked in super quick and bags taken up to the room. The buffet restaurant is great, lots of choice and changed each evening and the staff were always very pleasant and started to remember the drinks you liked at the table. A fresh bottle of wine always to the table, lovely touch..Chef often made an appearance and happy to help with a request! It’s a busy restaurant but for us had a good atmosphere. The rooms are big and cleaned daily, clean towels and mini bar topped up (small fridge with soft drinks) bar staff were always quick and smiley. Always plenty of sun beds and pool towels, it was Feb half term so busy but still relaxed…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,4,"Lovely Hotel, very nearly 5*","Visited this hotel with a couple of friends last week. The hotel is a large and well staffed hotel, and the staff are all very friendly. Check in was simple and we were escorted to our room, which as requested was on the main floor near a lift. The room was large, almost too big for the amount of furniture. Although a clean and spacious room, there was no storage other than the wardrobe. No drawers, no shelves, nowhere to put your smalls!! Also the toiletries were not 5* standard, in fact more like a budget hotel. Our air conditioning struggled and I would have complained if it had been in the summer, but fortunately it was cooler. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, indoor and outdoor pools, and plenty of sun beds. Two bars around the pool and one in the pool. A…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Some Winter Sunshine,"Not quite a spur of the moment decision but we chose the Riu Palace after a stay at the Dunas in November 2017. Agadir airport has had some new technology so immigration was quicker than we remembered. All the guests for the Hotel were on one coach so a speedy transfer. Our room (2098) was an hour short of being ready so we took the chance to get to know the Palace. First impressions were good and continued to be throughout the week. The Staff are excellent. In the many bars, the dining rooms, housekeeping and the pool. Everyone willing to help. The Palace does all inclusive well. Plenty of well presented choices at meal times. Drinks are of good quality and it is very nice to have a bottle of wine at meal times. In summary the Palace and its Staff provided a welcome all…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,February break,"Went to Morocco on a two week all-inclusive deal, organised with TUI and stayed here. From start to finish really enjoyed the hotel. We arrived around 1.00pm and our room was not ready but we were given our armbands and went for lunch while room was finished off. Room was a superior room on floor 3 and consisted of double bed and lounge area with widescreen television, bathroom with two showers, toilet and a dressing area with four wardrobe type cupboards. Safe was easy to operate and there was a fridge with a mini-bar, non alcoholic but useful. Rooms were cleaned daily and towels were changed on the same timescale. Hotel was on the promenade at the beach, beach front is five miles long. Hotel has a private area on the beach but we used the hotel pool for catching the sun.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,4,Good Experience (apart from Spa),"The hotel is beautiful, it is clean, tidy and modern. Staff are very welcoming and helpful. Our rooms were clean, apart from the shower/bath on arrival. Rooms are spacious, however when I arrived to my room my balcony door was open. Food was good, there was a variety of different meats and fish, but got a bit boring. But the desserts seem to be the same for lunch and dinner every day. Breakfast was lovely, amazing fresh crepes. The hotel shop was good, selling cultural souvenirs and good snacks. Swimming areas were clean, and enough beds for everyone. One of the outdoor pools were closed. Bad experience at the spa. Having experienced spas across the U.K. and in other countries, I was baffled by my experience. To start with, before any treatment, general health and safety…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,4,A quick holiday prior to Knee operation,"My husband and I had a very welcome holiday squeezed in before a knee operation. We chose this hotel as we knew from experience that it has very smooth floors which are wonderful for disabled people . We were also given a room with a shower and very near to the lift as we requested from TUI CUSTOMER CARE (Danielle) who was very helpful Once again the food was excellent All of the staff in the bar were very attentive especially Brahim who mixed our G&Ts and made our coffee in the evening and brought our lovely warm dry roasted peanuts, and during the afternoon again made my coffee and served my husband in the garden bar. From the garden one can walk out onto the long, wide, and even promenade which borders the sea on one side and on the other very nice low rise white hotels .…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Fabulous,"We have just arrived back from a really lovely stay at this Hotel . We got a very good last minute deal with TUI, we were initially concerned as to why it was such a good deal and had reservations about the security of the resort. However our concerns soon melted away once we arrived. The airport was very efficient and we passed through quickly to a 30 min transfer to the Hotel. Despite several emails from us and the tour operator our room requests were not met and we were not going to pay extra for it when other guests were given what they wanted for free. The room was very clean and well set out and was typical of the RIU dark look. The beds were very comfy and it was nice to have a quilt . Our cleaners looked after us well with towel art and the fridge was always kept…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Second time in this hotel and can't find a single thing to criticise,Just been back for a fantastic holiday. They initially allocated us a room which had steps down to the lounge area which was not suitable as my wife is in a wheelchair but they quickly moved us to a wheelchair accessible room which was ideal. The whole hotel is very wheelchair accessible. We ate in all the four restaurants and had fantastic food all the time. As it was Valentines day when we were there I asked reception if they could supply a bouquet of flowers. They must have thought it was our anniversary as we not only got flowers but champagne and a cake as well. All for 400 dirhams Can't wait to come back here again,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Guest,"Had a lovely stay here. Nice, friendly staff and beautiful surroundings. The Main buffet restaurant has such a large selection that you must find something to suit your taste. My partner and I celebrated our birthdays at the Krystal Fusion Restaurant. Thank You so much to the staff who made both our birthdays really special. A special thank you to the bar staff who mixed up some lovely, strong cocktails for us. Our only gripe was the lack of Irons available. They need to invest in a few more, especially when the hotel is busy. Overall, a great week with lovely weather. We'll be looking to return next year.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,Absolutely stunning,"We got a great deal through Tui for this holiday and were a little dubious due to the price we paid for a week all inclusive but it went above and beyond our expectations. From the moment we stepped through the door nothing was too much trouble. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful from the reception staff to the cleaners. The rooms incredible, I would recommend requesting a pool view, our room looked directly onto a road and another hotel but it didn’t massively bother us as we were hardly in it. Can highly recommend the spa, definitely worth treating yourself. Pool area spotlessly clean, although the water was cold it would be welcome on a hot day. The food is the best we have ever had at an all inclusive, and the drinks great also. Cocktails, branded spirits,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2019,5,Outstanding,"What a stunning destination, wonderful friendly staff, amazing food with incredible variety and choices.

 February 2019,4,Long but Honest review!,"I stayed at this resort for 1 week over the early February period, overall the hotel is very nice , very clean, very big and is a beautiful hotel to spend your time in Morocco at. Pros: beautiful big resort , some branded drinks , has a gym, indoor pool, nice variety of food. Cons: not much to do for young couples during the day and night , not enough variety of alcohol drinks , not a lot of daytime activities, private beach is in fact just a roped off area on a PUBLIC beach, bell boys expect to be tipped and will not leave your room until you tip, room needs more lighting!. The bedroom: we stayed in bedroom 4089 which is located right by the lobby which was nice and also we had a nice view of the beach from our balcony, inside the room you have a nice twin bed or king size…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Public areas are unbelievable, from the impact of entering the hotel to the superb gardens and pool area. Our room was great,a little tired in places but we were more than happy Directly onto the beach and a great promenade for a wander It would be easy to stay in the hotel but explore Agadir, what an experience But the two best things! The staff- I have travelled a lot and have to say that I have never had such attentive, friendly and kind staff. It’s also true many staff were greeting familiar guests like family.

It was a last minute booking to Agadir, Morocco done on the TUI app. A first visit to Morocco and a RIU hotel. In the fewest words possible what a fantastic 7 day break in the February North African Sun. Everything about the Hotel was top quality Clean, Modern,Food, Staff. Top quality Wi Fi throughout the complex. No complaints whatsoever, I real eye opener as too how other Hotel chains should be operated around the world.

 August 2018,5,Oriental Holiday,"This was an amazing hotel with a grand feeling. It had a relaxing atmosphere and had a modern, oriental style. When you first went in you could a grand reception and lots of sofas to relax in. The restaurants were very decorative and the food was mouthwatering and delicious. There was also an indoor and outdoor lunch restaurant and my daughter loved the pancakes and waffles with melted chocolate. There were big pools and also there was a pool bar and a outdoor bar to enjoy your drink and also maybe some nuts. Every evening there was an entertainment show in the entertainment hall with again lots of sofas and chairs in it. The shows were always very exciting and oriental and they had a lot of tension.

 January 2019,4,FANTASTIC! With a few little observations.,"Ok....here we go - my reviews are never short....BEWARE!. ROOMS- Spacious, clean, relaxing. Some areas are a little tired in places. The rooms are noisy. If someone upstairs has heels on you will know it, if next door put a plug in a socket you will know it. The noise from people coming and going along the corridors is bad at times, but there are outer doors to your room access, so close them. BATHROOM - Lovely monsoon showerhead, always hot. Shower over bath is not great for those less able to manage a high sided bath. No slip mat or built in grip to the bath, so can be a bit slippery. Grip rails are in place.

 February 2019,5,5* Winter Getaway,"We can barely fault our trip to this beautiful hotel. The staff alone deserve more than five stars; they’re all incredible, from the uber-professional reception team to the friendly and attentive waiter team, especially Moustapha who brought a lot of laughs to mealtimes along with flawless service. They all clearly work incredibly hard to ensure the guest experience is seamless, whatever your nationality, as almost all the staff speak at least three languages. Food was generally excellent but most buffet items were missing labels or labelled incorrectly so tricky to navigate as a vegetarian, however there were plenty of vegetarian options if you are careful. An unexpected highlight for us was the opportunity to enjoy some of the Agadir’s famous golf as the hotel runs free…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The restaurant had such a good selection I cannot understand somebody who said that there wasn't, much choice... there was ample as far as we were concerned.

Got through reception check in swiftly and were then directed to our lovely spacious room. The service we received was faultless and our room was cleaned daily with a supply of clean towels. The location was fine and the weather was good for this time of year although a cardigan or jacket was needed early morning and in the evenings. There is a good size gym with equipment in working order although there was one bike out of order for the week we were there but there were a few more to use. If you didn't fancy going to the gym, there was daily aquca aerobics and other activities facilitated by the animation team and what a great bunch of people they were particularly…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2019,5,Great Hotel,"Would definitely recommend staying here. From the hotel to the staff including the food all 5 star. We were very lucky as great weather all week, hardly any kids, no loud pool music, no mosquitos , hardly any wasps totally chilled week. Had a great afternoon tour of Agadir organised with your operator just inside hotel lobby, cheaper than Tui option & just the 2 of us in a taxi with knowledgeable guide. Most people we met were return customers or planning on returning, we would certainly think about returning. A nice chilled week , probably not the hotel you want if you want lively as it was mainly older couples no big noisy groups which suited us.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The gala dinner we a bit manic, but the food was excellent and the atmosphere was fantastic as the new year approached. Beautiful weather every day all ways for a sunbed where we wanted it. The staff are a credit to the Riu group. They all remembered what we where drinking weather it was in the restaurant or in the lounge. Didn't see many of the shows the entertainment team out on but we did have some great banter by the pool with one of the lads. Our room was on the 4th floor which suited us as we requested it.

 January 2019,5,Winter sunshine,"We spent a week here on 3rd January, fabulous hotel and location, beautiful warm weather everyday, around 22 degrees. The food in the restaurants is fabulous, something different everyday, wine beer, champagne and branded drinks also included in all inclusive rate. The staff are brilliant and cant do enough for you. Only thing I would say is watch out for the locals on the promenade they watch you come out of the hotel then pester you to buy goods or ask for money, after a few days we got wise to this and avoided them. Don't let this put you off as this is a fabulous place.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2019,5,Good Food/ Wine!,"I think the food and drink standards was very high, good quality wine/ cava, as they mostly cater for French people. Food was very good! Nice snacks provided by the bar, olives/ nuts. Breakfast was bit mental after 9.30…you could barely find a clean table, ages to wait someone to ask for coffee. Pastries however was very good! Also provides strawberries ( sometimes) for breakfast and cava :P Pool bit cold but manageable if u really want to swim. It was nice and refined around the hotel, no screaming kids :) Lunch with sea view  The only negative was that our beds was so hard and our daughter slept on divan, where the mattress was totally unacceptable! Springs out and VERY lumpy. We did ask reception to fix that, that is not 5 star or even 3 star standard ( we had better…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2018,4,Lovely resort hotel,"This was my third trip back to the Rui Palace with my elderly mum. It's an ideal resort, well laid out, nice gardens and just on the beach front. There are enough places to relax, not just the sun loungers if you want a shady place away from the pool. A few things have improved this year, the indoor pool now has a bar to help people get in and out of the pool. I noticed the whirlpool also had a bar but did not try this. Main reason is that it is surrounded by so many sun beds and you get a feeling of invading the space of those who are relaxing around it. The original charm of the place has changed, this is mainly due to the waiting the staff, they used to be quite helpful and cheerful. It now seems they are doing the job for the sake of it. Maybe there has a been a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The Christmas and New Year gala's were once again great. We travelled with family and our 19mth old and she loved all the attention from staff and swimming. Food has a great choice too. I didn't eat the same meal for the whole of my stay. A must is to visit the Krystal restaurant where you receive superb food and service. Top quality again as we also visited Christmas 2016 and we are sure to return. Thanks Riu Palace Agadir.Only thing that could be improved is cleanliness of rooms. More attention to detail for a palace is needed. Slats on doors in bathroom area are very dusty and balcony not always swept. Bathroom floor did not get moped to the edges…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

On arrival, check inn was smooth and very organised, reception had all relevant paper work waiting for us and it was very quick. We stayed at room 4015, we had a sea view room to the side of the hotel and it was perfect, clean towels everyday, replenished fridge and clean bed linen, rooms were spacious, although I found our air con a little temperamental at times. Food was ok, nothing to write home about, but there is always something you can find to eat. The staff some nights were very over keen and you couldn’t even have a sip of your drink before it was filled up again. We did test this one night, and a waiter kept coming over and over, until we gave him a tip and he never came back...tipping DOESN’T get you know where, only when…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Hard to Ask For More ! <,"Second cringe review I've written for the Riu Palace Tikida - first was six years back - but I feel that readers might need a reminder of just how good this place is. Stayed with large group and had faultless time. I haven't researched other Agadir hotels, but I can't imagine there are any/many better than the Riu Palace. Before penning my second self-indulgent and badly-written review, I read the tiny number of '1 circle' reviews that have been written in 2018, as I was curious to see how anyone could give the place less than a four out of five - it really is an exceptionally well-maintained, clean, spacious and stylish hotel with the staff its best asset.

In 2017 I uploaded an ‘outstanding!’ review recommending it to everyone who would listen so it’s with regret that we won’t be going back after our return yesterday. We have noticed a marked change this year in the level of service and the quality of food. Starting with the breakfast service; on numerous occasions we were shown to a dirty table and then had to ask more than once for someone to clean it and get us cups and cutlery etc. We weren’t offered tea or coffee and when we managed to get someones attention for hot drinks, it would often arrive cold.

Check In: This was fairly quick and efficient, bearing in mind about a whole coach arrived at the same time. We were only given one room key but we went back and got another one later. They had also run out of pool towel cards but we collected these later in the day, and before we needed to get pool towels.

My memories must be fading as I was surprised at the size and structure of the hotel and the excellence of the staff and service. There were plenty of visitors who had revisited several times and I can see why. Adapted room was large and clean. The facilities are excellent with a huge lobby feeding into bars and restaurants. The number of wheelchair users reflects the quality of disability facilities.

We stayed for 14 nights having flown out from Gatwick when the winter schedule with civilised flight times began operating. Flight was very comfortable and we sped to Agadir assisted by a large tail wind.. This year the Moroccan government elected to follow continental time so they are now one hour ahead of UK. We also choose the first fortnight in November to avoid autumn half term in the UK. Some continental countries have a school holiday during the first week of November so there can be smaller people around at this time.

We were regularly asked how things were, checking that we were enjoying our holiday, asking if we wanted any drinks etc. Some staff went out of their way to talk at length and it really made us feel at home. Even the bar manager went out of his way to come over and talk to us and tell us this was our home from home. In the restaurant we were welcomed quickly and taken to a table of our choice.

There is a large selection each day which always includes burgers, chips, spaghetti bolognese, pizza and plentiful salad. The variety is the different fish and meats which are either fried, grilled or carvery. Great choice of vegetables cooked in different ways - we couldn't understand why people say 'there is no variety'.

There is a lot to do in terms of activities in this location so you won’t be bored. The hotel is very well kept and clean. The food wasn’t great, under seasoned and for vegetarians the options aren’t amazing but still a decent selection. There dishes lack flavour and taste which made it so bland.

There was a lot of noise from moving furniture around in the room above during the day, but mostly we were out by the pool so it didn’t bother us so much.

The children’s pool - freezing The inside pool - cold The outside “heated” pool - cold, so it’s not enjoyable and you stay in the pools for minimal time.

Minor niggle about cutlery running out but not worth dinging them a star. We tried both the Crystal and Marrakech restaurants.

There was waiter service for drinks in the pool area and bars. There are a lot of French, German, Dutch, Belgian and Swedish in the hotel and people make effort to dress for dinner. It’s certainly not a roudy hotel. It has a nice relaxing feel and is quite sophisticated. We took a private transfer, which was well worth it and it took about 35 mins to get to and from the hotel from the airport. The rooms are spacious with comfortable beds. There is a kettle in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,Second visit fantastic,"This is the second time I’ve visited this hotel and it was just as good if not better than the first time around. The staff are absolutely outstanding and a credit to the hotel from the breakfast waiters, to the bar staff and entertainment team. They will go out of their way to ensure your stay is perfect and enjoyable. I spent my birthday here this year and they ensured everything was perfect for me, from flowers in my room to cake in the restaurant (thanks to the bf). One even remembered me from my stay 18 months ago. All the food was delicious, Krystal was perfect and the Moroccan restaurant was to die for highly recommend trying it. The Buffett restaurant was good all the food was delicious, every day at lunch and dinner there was something new to try. We travelled…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,Fabulous holiday,"Yet again we have had a wonderful holiday at this Riu hotel. Excellent, the staff are all brilliant, the food , just what you would expect from the palace so much choice, delicious, the head chef always so happy to talk about his food. Everywhere was very clean , Carlos is eating too much chocolate puddings, his Boss said he was getting fluffy. Well done to all the staff at this amazing hotel in Agadir and thank you all for making our holiday extra special.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,"Very attentive staff, excellent cuisine, large well equipped rooms.",We had a room on the same level as the reception and restaurants. Very convenient. Two bars on the way to the restaurant very handy for pre dinner drinks. Two good bars around the pools area. Plenty of loungers and nice private area on the beach with loungers and sun umbrellars. Regular activities around the pool during the day and an assortment of evening entertainments.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,2,Disappointed,Just back from staying a week at Riu tikida palace and have to say a little disappointed. Having stayed at 5* all inclusive hotels before I don’t think Riu hit the same level. Hotel has no room service so you have to eat at the restaurants set times. The key cards were frustrating as every other day it stopped working so had go back to reception to get it programmed again just to get back into my room. The reception staff kept making a point to not keep my phone near the card but some occasions didn’t even have my phone on me to wipe the card. Stayed 7 days and had to get my room card done at least 5 times. If you’re considering having a lie in think again because the noise of the maids making up the room and scraping the beds across the floor will make sure you’re awake. The…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,3,room for improvement,"I stayed here with my boyfriend in August, and was both pleasantly surprised but also disappointed. The hotel grounds are lovely and peaceful, plenty of places to sit and relax. The rooms are also very nice and quite large - the bathroom is very nice too. The lobby is gorgeous with very luxurious bathrooms, and a shop that is expectantly overpriced, but sells what you need. There are shops just down the road from the hotel though, which i would recommend walking to as they sell everything you'd need for cheaper. The poolside bar staff are nice, however as a woman i felt the things they said were a bit inappropriate so i felt uncomfortable going up to the bar a lot of the time. there is a wide selection of drinks - i recommend the strawberry daiquiri. However if you're…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,Great position in Agadir,"Pros: Great hotel position, had one or two slight issues which were attended to without delay. It was our 35th wedding anniversary, the hotel & staff went above and beyond to help celebrate. Flowers in our room, rose petals laid on our bed, bottle of champagne etc. The general condition of the hotel was very clean and tidy, Food was of good quality and choice in the main buffet restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Moroccan restaurant and Fusion were ok but not outstanding, (only our opinion). Rooms very comfortable and generally the hotel staff smiled making you feel very welcome. Cons: Afraid to report that the pool staff and bar staff in the lower pool bar (only one we used) were rude, unhelpful giving the opinion that they really didn't want to be there. As if it…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,4,Return Visit,"After having a great holiday here in February we decided to return, its a lovely hotel, clean , great outside space , super rooms. This visit though seemed as if standards had dropped a little. Mealtimes could be horrendous, no clean tables, having to clear ourselves and then reset as no service from staff. A few not all of the bar staff. Presented as rude and abrupt on a number of occasions, making ordering drinks a hassle. I do like the hotel even with the negatives and will visit again next year, hopefully better service. Cannot complain about cleanliness of room and service when our hairdryer stopped working, prompt arrival of maintenance man who quickly rectified. Still same sunned saving early hours, but that’s holidays, always plenty to go round if not in your favourite…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel, staff are all friendly, every member of staff we saw either smiled, said hello or stopped and had a conversation with us. Rooms cleaned daily, fresh towels in rooms each day as well. Pool area is fantastic, grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Spoke to 3 members of the management team all are friendly and approachable. Would definitely recommend this hotel and thinking of booking a return visit.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,3,Expected more,"Lovely hotel ,staff friendly enough . A few little niggles that I don’t expect from a 5star eg Broken tiles around the pool. Private beach area full of rubbish, food ok ,drinks horrible , room standard , Krystal restaurant waited an hour for our food , entertainment don’t seem to do much , very quiet around the pool although the heated section is a bonus .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,Tranquil & peaceful,"Just returned from a week at this lovely hotel. With its beautiful well kept gardens. People that you don't see or meet do a fabulous job at keeping this big hotel a delight to have a holiday. We arrived to an efficient check-in service. Bags were taken to our room as soon as we got our room number. The rooms are comfortable with a nice space. Eventhpugh we were on the third floor we had some little visitors which we walking round the floor. (Very small ants which bite) and mosquitos were around. Asking house keeping and they provided us with an insect repellant which helped. The rooms were kept clean but we did get left with no towels on two occassions and after 2 calls and one visit to reception we eventually got some after an hour, which was a tad irritating. The restraunt is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Holiday,"Hotel great, food very good. Staff very friendly and made my birthday very special. Pool could have been heated a little but other than that we really liked this hotel. The flight times weren’t great so would suggest a very early flight as we had early evening and arrived very late especially as we had children with us.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2018,4,Fab hotel but!,"We holidayed at Riu Tikida Palace, Agadir in September and chose to return to this hotel because we had such a great holiday on the previous occasion. The hotel itself was as nice as last time and is in a great location right on a long beach and short stroll to the centre and marina. The variety of food was good and the service by the restaurant staff was superb, we did give staff a small tip at the beginning of our holiday which helped. In our opinion a small price to pay for such brilliant service thereafter. You'll need to be up reasonably early to secure a sunbed, we generally put towels on a couple of beds on our way to breakfast at 8am and there was still loads of choice. The room appeared clean and tidy however the beds are very hard which might not suit everyone. I…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,4,Great return visit,"Just returned from another great weeks break at this hotel firstly let me say we will be booking again for next year. Perhaps that says it all? The food is amongst the best I have enjoyed anywhere. Great choice, well cooked, service is good but can be a little hit and miss. The staff are just brilliant and a credit to the hotel. However the senior management seem not to like engaging with customers. This is s change from the management style of previous years and somewhat reduces the customer experience. The hotel needs a little work and is beginning to look a little worn in places. The only negative is personal in that for the first time I can recall I have been bitten by mosquitos (30+) perhaps not directly the hotels fault of course but are they spraying everywhere?",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,"5th visit, year-on-year!","If ever you have any doubts about staying at this hotel, let this review reassure you. We have just returned home from our 5th visit and our stay was just as good as the first! As ever the staff are welcoming, friendly and efficient. We are always amazed at the genuine welcome we receive from members of staff who remember us from previous visits. As clichéd as it sounds, they really do make you feel like old friends! The weather was a very pleasant 23 – 25 degrees throughout the week. There were more than enough sunbeds to satisfy all the guests. One of our favourite things about this hotel is the fantastic food. Always so fresh and so much choice. This year didn’t disappoint! Never did we have a day without being spoilt for choice. We have already decided that we…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,Magnificent again!,Having read some of the reviews in recent months we were concerned that there had been a drop in standards. This was our 8th visit to this hotel and second of this year and I can assure all readers that the quality and service is as good as ever. I cannot understand any of the negative reviews. Arrived late at night and the reception staff were helpful as always. Bags were taken to our room very quickly The food in both buffet restaurants was varied and of good quality and the service from the staff was amazing. We went to the Moroccan restaurant which was great as well. The rooms which are junior suites are spacious and comfortable and you can request a mattress topper if you find the beds too firm. Maid service is excellent. The lobby of the hotel is probably the best…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for a week over October half term, and had such a lovely relaxing week. A lot of thought has gone into making this just a nice place to be, the rooms are lovely, and having a sitting area and balcony in each room is great, the staff are really friendly and go out of their way to help, and the food is just fantastic. I would 100% recommend this hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,4,Lovely relaxing holiday,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel, it was a very pretty hotel and we also opted for a junior suite which was nice. We asked for a sea view room but instead got a view of a wall. The terrace wasn’t used once due to us having no sun all day but other than that the room was nice. There was a great selection of food at the breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet however sometimes you would wait a while to be served. In the restaurants they only offer wine, beer, water or fizzy drinks - annoying if you want a cocktail or something else. We went to both speciality restaurants - Krystal was amazing it’s a shame we couldn’t have gone twice! The hotel in general is lovely and great if you want to relax like we did but also there is a lot to do around the area so we kept ourselves busy (Okey…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Very enjoyable time,"Wanted a late summer holiday and picked Morroco this year. On arrival the entrance looks very nice and inside very big too. Reception staff are very friendly and make it a very easy check in. Rooms was a very nice size with balcony looking over the pool. Room is cleaned well daily and the cleaners are very friendly. There is also a free mini bar that is topped up if used. Have had no problems with noise at all, everywhere is kept very clean, the spa is worth a visit as the massages are good. Plenty of sunbeds to use and the pools are kept up well with fresh towels given daily. The private beach is just right, it also keeps out the locals trying to sell things. The buffet food in restaurants are just what’s needed to suit all, plenty of fresh fish, meats, vegetables,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,4,Really nice hotel but with some dealbreaker gripes,"The property and the room were really nice - I had booked partly because of all the pictures I'd seen and this didn't disappoint. Pool area lovely and no issue with sunbeds or children etc. We spent all day at the pool sunbathing and maybe having a drink in the pool or whatever. Had a nice massage in the spa. Private beach available - the rest of the beach (no reflection on the hotel) was covered in plastic, bottle tops, even saw a condom. The food was very plentiful but my gripe was that it was all a little bland and the rotation each night only made a small difference, i.e. a couple of items would change and the main meats would change. After a few nights it was a bit bland and boring (still ate a ton anyway!) Do not expect a variety of mouth watering stuff i.e. one night…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It’s lovely being so near the beach; the surf here is AMAZING! We’ve loved our week and can think of nothing to complain about! SHUKRAN lovely Riu Tikida Palace!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Lovely hotel,We arrived late in the evening but the hotel had laid on a cold buffet for us which was a lovely touch. This hotel is lovely. Our room looked out onto a car park of the hotel oppisite but was pretty quiet apart from the weekend when the taxis would toot outside in early hours as that hotel has a night club. Our room was kept very clean and as it was my husband's birthday we had flowers put in a vase. Also hubby had a birthday cake during our meal. If you are celebrating a birthday go to reception and they will give you a letter to give to the head waiter. We found all staff to be very friendly and nothing was to much trouble. The hotel is beautiful but a little dark but if that's the only negative. We are normally beach people but I wasn't impressed with the beach so we stayed…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,1,Hi di hi,"Room is spacious but had a musty smell even after trying to air it during our stay. My son who is 9 had a large sofa bed. The tiles around the bath tub could do with a good scrub using bleach. You can see the black fungus whilst lying in the tub. There is no information on meal times, facilities or phone directory in the room. Food is adequate but definitely not five star. Sushi don’t taste like sushi, Chinese, sweet and sour is just sweet syrup. As for the fruit, grapes are not really washed and cut Kiwi is not ripe. Fish and pizzas are good. Sauces could be better, fairly tasteless. Meat cooked on the grill is chewy. This place is definitely feeding the masses. Quantity over quality. Given that it is all inclusive we were not complaining. The spirits at the bar by the pool,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2018,5,"Brilliant Hotel, Excellent Service","Our first time at this hotel, would definitely return in the future. The food was good, and the two restaurants on site were absolutely lovely!

 October 2018,5,Still excellent,"This is the 3rd time I’ve stayed here. Everything about the hotel is excellent, I didn’t want to come home. I will be going back for a 4th visit, The food offers you a huge choice, there is always something for everyone. The only thing that the hotel needs to improve on is the evening entertainment as it was quite poor, but that didn’t bother me personally. The service is very good.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Great hotel - shame about the weather!,"Only there for 5 nights but loved the hotel. Couldn't find anything to fault. The room was comfortable, clean and had a shower to die for. The staff were all lovely and helpful whether you tipped them or not. The highlights were the 2 a la carte restaurants - the Moroccan and Krysal. Krystal was my favourite - a top class fusion menu which really worked! The chocolate soufflé was fantastic. And all served with really nice wine at no extra charge. Wouldn't go back to Agadir as found the area dirty, lacked the character of Marrakesh and the wind just chilled everything even on sunny days! But if you do go to Agadir stay here and remember to book the restaurants - 2 sittings 7 o'clock and 9 o'clock - they weren't busy so I don't think many people bothered - they missed out!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,4,Nice hotel,I was there late October with my 2 boys. The animation team are exceptional they remembered my sons name despite him never attending kids club. The choice and quality of food was amazing I tried many dishes I would say the snack bar isn’t as good as the main restaurant and the staff were not as friendly. However the staff in the main restaurant and the reception bar were great and with a small tip we got constant waiter service again the pool bars weren’t as forthcoming during the day. The hotel was exceptionally clean the maid service was fantastic your room was serviced everyday to a high standard.

Top 5 star in Morocco all branded drinks all inclusive, 24hour room service top gym and spa and the food is to die for! Visit you won't be disappointed.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,4,Great holiday,"We really enjoyed our stay, all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room overlooked the hotel next door but was very spacious and clean. The pool guys always found us sun loungers even though we didn’t go down to the pool until after breakfast. Our only criticism was that everywhere was a bit dark. I understand that we all need to conserve energy but a little more light would be nice. The choice of food was excellent and we enjoyed the wide selection of drinks available. The beach was excellent and a very nice promenade to enjoy. Thanks for a great holiday!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2018,5,Nothing to moan about. Perfect.,"We arrived in the morning and felt immediately relaxed, they gave us a few options with the rooms, which they didn't need to do, but they always go above and beyond when it comes to customer service. Our room was facing the sea, so at nights falling asleep and waking in the mornings, it was to the sound of the ocean, and as the full length of the massive room is sliding doors, we opened them back while drinking our morning coffee, so we could get the cooling sea breeze in the room. The room above had someone walking around with heels on, but a quick call upstairs on the in-house phone and we never had the problem again.

Yesterday was one of the few days it rains in Morocco and the bar area was full all day, the bar staff worked tirelessly to provide a good service and can I just add we are not one of the big tippers!!

 October 2018,1,Poor hygiene throughout hotel,Hotel was big and impressive on arrival but failed to impress thereafter. Paper thin ceilings resulted in you being able to hear people above walking around at all hours in their heeled shoes. We witnessed staff at the pool bar drinking straight from water bottles and then pouring customers glasses of water from the same bottles. Each morning was a scrabble for beds. You had to get up at 6am to make sure you got one. All of the pillows and mattresses you placed on beds were dirty and never cleaned. Staff only serve you if you're a big tipper otherwise it's hard to get their attention. Food in the restaurant is only ever served warm and no microwave is provided to change that.

Staff are very friendly and accomodating. Facilities are kept pristine, rooms are serviced everyday and towels, water soft drinks are replenished aswell as beers if requested. Food is fantastic and caters for all needs however after dining in the buffet a few times the dishes became a bit samey, however they do, do theme nights like Spanish night in there which is nice. We dined in the 2 specialist restaurants a few times, one being a Morrocan Cuisine which i would reccomend the Fish Tagiene in and the other being a fusion restaurant which was exceptional. There was a great variety of drinks, alcoholic and nonalcoholic alike. Overall the Holiday…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,4,Comfortable!!,The hotel was exceptionally clean and spacious in all areas. This includes the guests rooms. Clean towels was given every day in rooms as well as by the pools. There was always a good variety of dishes to choose from at mealtimes. The surroundings were very tastefully set out. We were unlucky to have experienced electric problems several times which could not be sorted out. We were then given another room. The fire alarm went off at different times too but no fire. Despite this it was a very great hotel and we enjoyed our stay.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,4,Good Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel last June and really enjoyed our stay as a couple. The food variety and entertainment was brilliant and i would definitely recommend a stay here. The rooms were lovely and spacious and always cleaned to a high standard. Location wise if you walk out of the hotel on to the beach promenade you can walk all the way down to the harbor passing restaurants, bars and shops on the way, to get to the harbor took around half an hour but it was a lovely walk :) The pool area is very large with loads of sunbeds but if you want a good location you do have to get up early to reserve this and i am sure that people were tipping staff to put towels out on their behalf because i got up around 4am everyday and pretty much every day the best sun beds had gone already even…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,4,Mr singh,"We visited this hotel in may with my child, wife and I. Had a lovely holiday. Cleanliness was very good, Good service. The only complaint I have is about the food. After three days the food got abit boring. Don’t get me wrong there was a good selection of food but it was very very bland. For example, pizza is on offer everyday, but it tasted so bad. I can make a better pizza myself and I’m no chief. (Tesco oven pizza tastes better) How can a 5* hotel get pizza wrong???? My son hated the pizza. To sum it up the food lacks flavour and worldwide choices, why not have authentic Indian/Italian/Mexican/chinese foods time to time. I hope this comment gets noted because apart from the food issue the hotel was awesome.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,4,Pleasantly surprised,"I stayed at the Riu Palace Tikida for 1 week (13th-20th October). I was very apprehensive about the holiday having read some of the mixed reviews. Our party consisted of my elderly grandmother and disabled uncle (85 and 55 years respectively), my parents (late 60s) and myself and my husband (early 40s). Ahead of travelling, I had ensured that the hotel were aware of the disability of one of our party (blind and with walking difficulties) and requested a room with a walk in shower rather than a bath as it would be difficult for him to climb into. The hotel had upgraded them to a suite, which was extremely thoughtful. However it was a long distance from all the main facilities and on the other side of the hotel to where others had been allocated. Eventually after looking at other…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We arrived around 10pm to a welcome drink and smooth check in process. We had a quick look at our room and were pleasantly surprised at how spacious, clean and comfortable it was if perhaps a little dated in decor. The cases arrived quickly but we decided rather than unpack to return to the lobby bar with its live music and friendly atmosphere and from this moment on our holiday was relaxed with excellent service with efficient and friendly staff.

There was a alarm going at least twice a day minimum at random hours through day & night much to the annoyance of all. We don’t know what it was for however maintance kept having to rectify it & it did take a while (10 min so so). It was strange & very annoying, luckily once it was off I didn’t let it get me down, however other visitors made it very clear & vocal this alarm was getting on their nerves.

It was the second week of our multicenter holiday and after over 3 hours drive from Marrakech we arrived at the Riu Palace Tikida. We'd already stayed at a Riu Tikida hotel in Marrakech the week before and one in Agadir the previous year but this was by far the nicest looking of the three. We arrived before the room was ready, so they gave us our gold Wristbands, took my friends mobile number and said to go to lunch and they'd call us when the room was ready.

We had read about the “run down” condition of the hotel. We had read about the “boring food “and we even had read about the poor chap who wanted to wear his shorts to dinner! Well my friends disregard the absolute poorly informed piffle you have read. Either they stayed in a different hotel or their experience of life is limited ( I’m being charitable) We are regular world travelers. From Kiev to Constantinople , from Lisbon to Lahore we’ve been there and written the reviews, (they now run to hundreds on TA)When criticism is required “ it is dished out”.

I can’t single out any one member of staff as they are all very good. It’s was my wife’s birthday while we were there, they put flowers in the room and gave us special treatment in the restaurant. Well done to everyone at this hotel, keep up the good work.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,3,Not a 5 star,"Ok so this is based purely on my experience this week and can be taken with a pinch of salt. This should not be a 5 star hotel. Though it may tick off the right criteria for it, the quality is far below what I would expected. The lunch and snacks were poor and lacked any kind of healthy options. The only positive about dinner was that they served plenty of fish and did have a good selection but the quality was no different from 3/4 star in Europe. Men are required to wear trousers every evening meal even in the buffet so be prepared to sweat guys. Very limited outdoor seating so expect to queue. Almost zero entertainment in the evenings. They have a guy playing the guitar and singing covers that we really enjoyed but after a few nights it was very repetitive. The animation…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2018,5,Another great stay,"This was our 8th stay in this hotel so obviously we like it. I have to laugh at some of the reviews on trip advisor e.g. the beach was not private. Yes, a disgrace. Riu should bar everyone else from the beach and only allow guests from this hotel on it. Oh, there are 2 other Riu Hotels on the beachfront, should we let them on the beach? Get real people! Another one I liked was - there are camels on the beach. This is Morocco, the Sahara desert stretches in to Morocco. The most camels I saw in any one day on the beach was five. I don't think that is excessive. Most people love seeing the camels and rides or picture opportunities are available. As for the hotel my wife and I were of the opinion that the food in the main restaurant was the best it has ever been. Can I remind guests…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,The place to go!,"We had an awesome stay at the Riu Palace Tikida in Agadir! Everything is beautiful, each person offers great services and are so carring.

 October 2018,5,Fabulous Holiday,"Having just returned from a 10 day Holiday and my first visit to Morocco I am happy to say that I had a fabulous time. I could go on about the gorgeous food, sunny weather, nice drinks, large clean room but I'm not, I am going to focus on what really impressed me about this Hotel and that was the staff. Everybody from the maids, to the Pool boys to all the restaurant staff and the reception team really made this a super friendly and happy atmosphere. They greet everyone with a smile, and they work really hard. There were several Managers who would frequently walk around the Hotel in all areas who are clearly available to deal with any issues promptly and on my last night I spoke to one of them {the very nice looking one with the beard!} and I congratulated him on the staff and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2018,3,summer holiday,"This was our tenth visit to the Palace. But we feel this time the standards had dropped slightly. I.e. They ran out of certain drinks in the evening. There was a more relaxed dress code in the restaurant in the evening, so men were allowed to wear shorts, flip flops and baseball caps. So to me the dining was not 5 star. Also although there was a large smoking area people were allowed to use e-cigarettes inside. These make more smoke and smell, which is worse than a normal cigarettes. No smoking should mean no smoking.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Excellent with a few very small Nigel’s,"Arrived early hours in the morning, quick quick in and was offered left over food 🥘 from the evening meal. Room perfect for our needs and was kept very clean, fridge restocked everyday with soft drinks and bottled 💧 water, Food could not complain with the buffet very good choices for meat eaters or vegetarian and the cakes 🍰 were lush. Plenty of drinks on offer at the bars including hot drinks, the slushes around the poolside bar was wonderful, Pool was good and lots of sun beds but people do get up very early to put there towels out but never use them this in one of my Nigel’s as this is also done by the pool attendants... Beach very long and good waves part of it is roped of for each hotel, I think this could be to stop the sellers from mithering trying to sell goods…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Amazing holiday,"We stayed here as a couple for a week (4-12 Oct) and were both slightly dubious due to some reviews we had read in the months before going. The flights are late at night and the passport control delays are the longest I have ever seen even after visiting various other Arab countries, so arrived at the hotel at around 1am after a delay in the bus leaving the airport (would definitely recommend a private transfer in the future due to their lack of urgency), and were greeted by drinks in reception and the option to have buffet food in the dining room which we declined as we wanted to get into our room and sleep. The check in procedure was speedy and friendly and the luggage porters offered to take your cases up to the room naturally for a tip once they had reached your room. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,4,Honest review,"We stayed at the Riu palace 27th sep-8th Oct We arrived almost near midnight welcomed by a drink and they had left a cold buffet out. We had a look but wasn’t hungry. Check in was quick considering the amount of people that had arrived. I was very anxious prior to our arrival due to some of the reviews I had read as we booked this short notice due to our other holiday being cancelled. The room- nice and clean, maids cleaned daily we had not issues with the room. We found the there was a lot of light switches and after 11 days we still hadn’t mastered what switched did what lights ha ha. The pool- large pool split in half it says there is a kids pool but it’s in the kids club so not a pool as you might imagain. The jacuzzi was broken for a few days so this soon become our…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Branded drinks and the food is great (especially the French toast at breakfast and the beef goulash / tagines) . Literally 20 seconds away from the beach. We done the 4x4 Atlas Mountains excursions from Tui and loved it, has bad reviews online but we thought it was great. Can’t wait to return",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Better than expected,"Returned from this hotel on Friday 5th. My wife and i love our holidays but having read the reviews from July/August we were worried that this was going to be one of the worst. How wrong we were! The flight was good and going through immigration and customs was typically 3rd world. Disorganised and unfriendly is all i can say. Arrived at the hotel just before midnight. Check in was quick and we were offered food which we declined as wanted to unpack and sleep. We eventually found our room and it was lovely. Well laid out room with proper double bed,seating area, decent bathroom, safe, fridge, tea and coffee plus the required air con and fan!

 September 2018,5,Fantastic stay in a great hotel!,"Spacious and spotlessly clean rooms with a free safe, mini bar and patio area. The main lounge has plenty of comfortable sofas and chairs. Reception staff are professional and provide you with very good advice. However, when changing money you may get a better rate off site. There is a 24 hour main bar with very attentive staff - you never have to wait long. Massive pool with well stocked swim up bar and two other bars. All bar staff ensure you are served quickly. The beach is a short walk across the promenade and has plenty of sun beds and parasols provided by the hotel. You will have to walk back to the hotel pool bar to get a drink though. Hawkers are everywhere but a polite ‘no thank you’ should suffice. There is a well equipped gym and indoor pool both of which…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2018,5,WONDERFUL,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel as part of our Diamond Wedding Celebration. It was the 6th time we had stayed at the hotel and once again we had a wonderful time. Nader Ghoshem, Director and his very pleasant helpful staff from the room cleaners, pool attendants, restaurant staff, animation team, bar staff ensured that we had an excellent time.The room was very good and clean and every meal time there was a wide selection of very good food.

 October 2018,5,Wonderful Hotel. Well Run,We are still here 5days into 14 no problems service from every Dept. Very good. Very friendly staff. Drinks all Top quality never had to ask for them. Don’t know what people have to complain about. Only hitch for me was No walk in Pool. I have difficulty climbing the steps. But managed. Also some people had verry large Liloes. Which are apparently aloud. Taking up space in the pools.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,3,Okay on the whole,So we return today from a 7 day stay at this hotel. First off all the staff are amazing they work very hard and the hotel is clean and beautiful to look at. The room is ok. The shower was not very powerful and the overhead fan did not work. We were without tea and coffee and soft drinks for 4 days despite asking at the reception. Food hmmm there is no variety and it was the same every day. On the whole cooked well and plenty of it if that is what you want. The two themes restaurants weren’t very good and the Moroccan left a lot to be desired. This was sold to us as a platinum 4 star and it isn’t. The snacks in the afternoon are just left overs from dinner. At other sites we have had popcorn nacho and ice cream but not like that here. There are plenty of sun beds very comfortable…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

When we first got into the hotel we were impressed by the size and general decor of the lobby, rooms, restaurants and even pool area and landscape was beautiful. We used the two weeks to completely relax and we was not disappointed. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner we were well and truly looked after in every way and could not ask for more attentive staff. Everyone in there is so friendly and they really do make the holiday. This is from the waiters / waitress' to the bar staff, to the animation ( entertainment ) team. The buffet food was always lovely and the Krystal restaurant was beautiful, it makes you feel like you should be paying for the food at the end of it as the food is so…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

FOOD: Breakfast: was uninspiring, sausages were small and tasteless, I have stayed at other Riu hotels and the breakfast have been great, different variety of options daily, but here was the same everyday. even the omelets you had limited choices. Lunch: this is served by the pool area restaurant, was a verity on most days, great if you love pizza.. evening meal: Lots of choices, food was of good standard, just felt that it was mishmash of where to find items, meats were cooked at every counter, you had your fish and your Italian…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2018,5,Amazing 10 days,Me and my partner are on our last night of our 10 night stay here. What a great week it has been. The weather has been gorgeous everyday with some nice storms to view at night. We went to the pool most mornings around 9:30/10 and there were still plenty of beds left. The pool staff are super helpful if you need a bed or a parasol. All the staff are super friendly and I must give a big thanks to brahim who’s service in the normal buffets and the Marrakech restaurant were five star. Abdou was also really good and went out of his way to make you the perfect drink at the bars. The entertainment team were really good and would always be up for a chat and try get you involved in a game but they were by no means pushy. I really enjoyed the food.

 September 2018,5,2 weeks in the Sun,"Just back from staying here. Check in very quick, suitcases taken to the room. They kept the buffet open so if we needed a quick bite there was food available. We checked in around 11:30 in the evening. A good tip is to pre book a taxi even if booking through TUI as we arrived 2hrs before the coach. Room was a little dark but spacious and a little step on to the sitting area and the Balcony with views of the mountains. Yes there is mist but usually in the morning for a couple of hours. You still need sun cream as you can still burn. Swim up bar very good. Good choice of local and branded drinks 🥤 and nobody hogging the bar. Staff very friendly and they remember your drinks.

Check in was extremely quick and easy and we were able to get something to eat even though we arrived late.

Manners go a long way and if your friendly and polite they will treat you well. Sadly we did witness several rude customers at the resort. Our room was huge and clean with a regularly stocked minni bar. The buffet we found to be very good, we managed to get in both the krystal and Marrakech restaurant where the service was excellent.

The hotel grounds are lovely and the pool is so relaxing. It says you can't reserve beds but if you don't before 10am you are not getting a bed.

I have previously holidayed at Hilton resorts, and do look to book luxury when I go away. For me, the negative reviews were not worth reading and worrying about. Overall my partner and I had a fantastic trip, a lovely hotel with gorgeous rooms and a blissful pool area. We would both absolutely recommend this hotel. To break the holiday down... Arrival - we booked a private transfer to the hotel instead of joining the group coach. I highly recommend this as you get to everywhere earlier and so avoid the queues.

We were welcomed by a gorgeous and large reception area and some food and drinks after our late night arrival. This hotel is rated as a 5 star platinum with TUI , but I would say a 4 star or plus would be a fairer rating. The food is very good with a great variation, a few dishes get repeated, but its normally the burgers and chips etc for the Brits. I found the hotels hygiene to be very good, with hand gel at every hotel entrance.

The staff on check-in are very friendly and get you checked in with no fuss. the rooms are a very good size but they are a little tired. I would expect better quality bedding and towels as well as better quality toiletries to be supplied. The lighting in the rooms is a little dark for my taste.

This hotel is beautiful! As most have mentioned, the lobby is breathtaking, and the rest of the hotel is not far behind. The rooms are lovely, and although the beds tend to be a little hard, all you have to do is ask for a topper. The food in the main restaurant is not the best, but this is an all inclusive hotel, which means they are catering for thousands of people on a daily basis, so I didn’t expect the food to be five star.

 September 2018,5,Another great holiday,"This is our second time staying at this hotel and we really enjoyed it again this place is very well maintained and spotlessly clean. However there are a few things I think could be improved, we traveled with a 5 month old and we found it hard to keep him cool as the only place in the hotel that has air conditioning is the bedrooms. I also found the food to be a bit hit and miss, some dishes are quite nice but others were just bland or seemed to all taste the same. And the last thing is no room service! Most other 5star hotels I’ve stayed in offer a room service just a suggestion. Apart from that we couldn’t fault it the staff are friendly and helpful and we will definitely be returning again next year",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Lack of HYGIENE. If my review stops one person from booking this hotel I will have stopped them from wasting money and having a terrible experience. We are a retired couple who holiday 5-6 times a year in hotels round the world from 2* to 5* and this is the by far the worst hotel we've ever stayed in.

It’s near enough the same thing every night no change. If you have allergies they do not care there are no signs telling you what the food is / what is in the food so good luck with that one. I asked a waiter what was in something and he just shrugged at me. The only decent food was in the Fusion restaurant. The rooms are nice, but the bed was like a rock I think I would have been more comfortable outside on a sun lounger. I did not…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2018,2,An Honest Opinion,"Ok so there are mixed reviews on the site so I will to be as honest as possible, Regardless of where you travel you are always going to find faults. Moaning about the weather is pointless on any reviews but stating that the sun does not break through the clouds most days until Dinner time is helpful but no fault of the Hotels. Upon arrival you enter the large and clean looking main lounge areas where we checked in quickly enough and had our bags tagged to be taken to the room. It would have been very helpful if someone had told us in which direction to head to get to the rooms though, The Hotel is basically 2 wings and luckily enough we chose the correct direction but at a minimum some signs pointing to room numbers would be a good idea. We were delayed and it was 1am when we…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2018,5,Fantastic break together,"I was recommended the hotel by a friend and I was not disappointed. You can’t fault the hotel/staff and service. Trips were good value too. My only criticism keep the pool bars open in the evening and not the hotels fault but weather can be cloudy. Other than that, a brilliant break. Thank you",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,2,We will not be returning,"We booked our holiday with TUI who we have used on previous occasions and we flew out from Gatwick on the 30/07/18 for 1 week, this hotel had been recommended to us from a couple who normally visit in the winter. We both work in education so had been looking forward to our annual relaxation and wind down after a very busy and hectic academic year but alas we could not have anticipated the following events. Firstly on arrival at the airport we were guided to the wrong coach and hence arrived at the wrong hotel (we have complained to TUI but they have yet to respond) we then paid for a taxi to take us to the correct hotel (beware of local taxis) on arrival to the hotel we checked in and made our way to our room, beware if you are given a room number with an odd number because the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,3,Not a 5 *,"When booking to stay here we read the reviews, and to be honest I really can’t believe some of the nasty ones, but, you can read between the lines and pick out the truths, some massively over exaggerated. Our stay has been very pleasant, a lovely hotel, albeit a bit scruffy round the edges, could do with a good overhaul, some staff members are nice and helpful, and some actually quite rude. The food I cannot knock, cooked, and presented very well, the choices of restaurant is good, the Morrocan restaurant being our most visited and more importantly served the best food, looked after by Hanan (lovely lady), see pictures attached, chicken in lemon tagine just delightful.

 August 2018,1,Don’t do it....,"This hotel is sold and advertised as a 5* platinum and not a 4* I’m keeping this short and sweet. This place is a disgrace from top to bottom. There is no hygiene i.e staff coming out of lavatories without washing hands or useing gel, and filthy plates and cutlery in food halls, the management refer to you as liars when reporting issues. There will be major complaints going into Riu and tui upon my return. I have stayed in far better 4* and possibly far better 3* On a positive the animation team keep you from dropping into deep depression throughout your stay.

 August 2018,4,Very enjoyable,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 11 nights from August 17th. After a brief airport transfer, we arrived at the hotel around midnight to be met by porters who took our luggage, provided us with a welcome drink and showed us to the reception. First impressions were very good, the lobby looks great at night with the perfect lighting and traditional Moroccan furniture. Following a swift check-in we made our way to room 4083 on the fourth floor (the lobby, restaurants and entertainment area are located on the third floor). The room was nice and spacious with an electronic safe and a fridge. Our luggage turned up after a few minutes and whilst the porter wasn't expecting a tip, we gave £2. He was very polite and grateful. My wife then had a shower and we encountered a problem. A…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,4,"Oh dear, Agadir!",Even before choosing your hotel in Agadir there are two things to consider: 1. If you want wall to wall sunshine in June -August then Agadir is not the place for you. (We were aware of issues with the weather before we travelled but overall we experienced 60/40 in terms of cloudy or clear skies throughout our stay.) 2. If you want to immerse yourself in Moroccan culture then Agadir is not for you. If neither of the above apply then the Palace is the best hotel to stay in according to the locals and we would agree with this. It is definitely the most attractive and best kept hotel we saw in the hotel area of the city. Once inside the hotel this was also largely true in the outdoor areas and the public areas and particularly the reception. The two rooms we had were on the top…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,5,Palace is the correct title,"Returned from this hotel late August and can’t say enough good things about it. The foyer/bar area is impressive with its dark decor and its lovely soft seating areas, this area has a lot of unusual ornaments which added sophistication. Our rooms were on the same level and we requested that our two daughters room was next door to ours which they honoured. The rooms are spacious and immaculate. We did have entertainment going on outside where the small market is until about 11.30 every night which made going to bed a little early on the odd occasion difficult but it was for the local people and their children who was on their school holidays so we couldn’t ruin their fun by complaining. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful with a children’s play area, an area to play table…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,3,"OK as a 4*, but don’t expect the 5* advertised experience","I am writing this on day 9 of our 14 night holiday at the Riu Tikida Palace, so all points are our fresh, in the moment personal opinions. For those reading in a rush, the summary is, the Palace is a decent 4* hotel (it’s not a 5* as advertised), which should allow most people to have a fairly relaxing Moroccan break. Now, the detail.... THE LOBBY AREA: Stunning! This is where the attention to detail has gone. It’s a lovely space, with high quality furnishings. As the centre of the hotel, it’s clear that here is where the staff spend the time and attention. The lobby serves as the main bar area and the entry point to the main buffet restaurant and 2 of the 3 speciality restaurants, as well as the main show area. There’s seating for a few hundred people on plush chairs and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,1,Daily stress of pool towels,They never had clean towels to the pool or beach. We had to wait for half hour daily to get them. Lot of pool chairs with towels belonging to no one. Claimed to receptionist and he told there were no towels because the hotel was full of thousand people and I had to wait! Very unprofessional answer. They should manage a system to control towels per person and towels that are left on pool chairs and rooms. And should invest on staff trainee!!! Not acceptable for a 5 stars hotel !!!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,5,Glorious break in the sun,"I’m just back from a week at the RUI Tikida Palace with my eight year old son and 72 year old mother. Having booked online on something of a whim, I was then panicked by some poor reviews on here, such that I warned my family that it might not be a very good hotel afterall... I need not have worried. This place was absolutely fantastic. The location is great for Agadir and metres away from the ocean, the grounds are beautiful, the food options are delicious and varied, and the staff are fantastically friendly and helpful. Upon check in, we were upgraded to a Suite for the week, which was an amazing start. The room was very clean with a lovely view of the ocean.

 August 2018,2,Could be so much better.,"We are on day 8 of our 10 night stay and I thought I had done well. Unfortunately I have now joined the many who are hugging the toilet. Should make for an interesting flight home. I simply do not trust the hotel’s standards of cleanliness. The hotel is beautiful and at first glance very well kept but if you look at things in more detail, you’ll find the dirt and the grime. Things are broken and never get fixed. Cups and cutlery are not cleaned properly and I’m certain all the waiters and waitresses don’t wash their hands regularly. If you think a genuine 5 star hotel will advertise on TUI then you are naive. This is a TUI rating only. The main fault for germs being spread however is the guests. Dirty, ignorant and arrogant guests who barge their way through the dinner halls and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2018,1,Worst 5* ever,Stayed here last week and we came home friday and we are still poorly as we caught a severe sickness and diaorhea bug that was going around the hotel! We were told in the welcome meeting about this bug and was told to always wash your hands and use the sanitizers which were always empty and had to keep asking them to fill them up! Oh and to only use your toilet in your room! However we still got the bug 3 days into our hol! I would not recommend this hotel as the cleanliness and service is def not 5*.

 August 2018,5,Excellent All Inclusive Hotel,"Just returned from vacations in Morocco with family and friends . In Agadir we stayed in this hotel that matched entirely our expectations. Very good infrastructures (the hotel seemed quite new), excellent swimming pool that concentrated all the activities during the day. The food was good (but some more diversity would be good). Cleaning was also good (not exhaustive) We enjoyes very much the lobby, reception and bar areas where the decoration was beautiful and allowed for a very good atmosphere. The only point not so positive is that if you have rules they are meant to be obeyed. So if one of the swimming pool rules is no chairs reservation that rule should enforced. It is ridiculous people waking up at 6 am to put towels in the chairs and then getting back to bed. One final…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The staff at the hotel and in Morocco in general were incredibly friendly and nothing was to much trouble, the service we received was outstanding. Our room was serviced daily and had a large bathroom, large balcony and was spotless. The resort was very busy in August, and the beach full of locals on weekends, we went to the souk and shopped in the local shops again meeting some lovely friendly people.

We paid a little bit extra for this room, but it was definitely worth it. It also had a huge balcony which was a lovely addition! The pool was large and there was a lot of variety of sunbeds around it, and we never struggled to get a bed or sit/lay where we wanted to.

If you want baking hot sun all day long, hose somewhere else. The hotel is very pleasant with well landscaped gardens surrounding two outdoor pools. There is a third pool inside for the cooler months. The food is simply fantastic. The main restaurant provides a buffet offering a huge variety of salads, main dishes and deserts catering for all tastes.

They accommodated us by giving us a lovely room facing the pool/garden area on the ground floor.

The bar staff are great as i said before a tip goes along way,but it's the value for money that we like you try and get a hotel in the Canaries for anywhere near for the same price I've tried and can't.

We really enjoyed the food and thought there was a good range of options every meal. I would definitely recommend booking into the Krystal restaurant and the Moroccan. The Italian was just the Italian buffet selection from the usual, nothing special. Lunch time was a bit hectic some days with more guests than space and staff.

For me the hotel was too big, don’t get me wrong it looked amazing but don’t let that fool you, in my opinion they didn’t have the staff to cater for the capacity of the hotel, for example everyday I had to ask for bottles of water for our room and everyday it would take them hours!

 August 2018,1,Not a 5 star keep looking.,Me and my partner booked this as our first holiday and from first impression the hotel looked amazing.However most food from the buffet is luke warm and kept out for a while.Me and my partner fell ill on the third day due to the food and still 1 week later visiting the doctors because of this.The hotel does not maintain high standards with cleanliness when it comes to being poorly! We had to ring up for our sick to be removed out the room as the maids did not change the bin as we were to Ill getting to the toilet in time.As for management I don’t even know where they was most the time! We asked plenty of times why they did not send water up for us when we rang for it due to being poorly.After speaking to many people staying at this hotel a lot of them fell poorly from the food.I…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,5,Stunning hotel 😍,"Just returned from 10nights. Absolutely stunning grounds. Just have a few pointers. We arrived the Monday. Was in bed all day Wednesday, to a bug that was going round. Nothing at all to do with the food etc, as we all know, only takes one person to be ill, then everyone is. So..... Weather- it’s is very very misty, but don’t be fooled, I’m darker than I’ve ever been, so you do tan. This clears usually by lunch time. Food- absolutely loved every single meal I ate. Food is delicious and so freshly cooked too. Rooms- Very spacious. We did ask for a topper as the bed was a little to hard for us, wasn’t a problem, few hours later that was sorted. Animation/Waiters- Perfect. They all work so hard and very long hours and always have huge smiles on their faces. You can go…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2018,5,Fantastic hotel,"We had a wonderful week in Agadir at this fantastic hotel. The hotel is of a high standard with excellent service, staff are wonderful and attentive. We ate in the al a carte restaurants which were very good. The entertainment team were so lovely and friendly, especially Rachid. I’ve stayed at many luxury hotels around the world and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2018,4,Very nice!,"Got back this morning from Tikida palace. Very friendly staff clean comfortable and spacious rooms and public areas. After reading some of the recent reviews I was a little bit disappointed to read that the pool was closed due to a gentleman pooing in the pool, yes the pool was closed off briefly because of the stomach bug that was circulating the guests, I succumbed to it twice and it was very unpleasant, the water was tested treated and then reopened after an hour or so, and the process was repeated at the other part of the pool. Unless the offending poo was seen in the water I would be a little unsure about that. I witnessed people not washing hands, children un supervised touching food and running around spitting out chewing gum etc, mothers changing babies on sun loungers…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2018,3,Family holiday,I would give this place a 3/5. Not the best hotel I’ve stayed in or not the worst. Found the food options a bit basic for vegetarian. Food was either over cooked or undercooked. Lobby area and pool area was clean. Bedrooms need a bit of TLC. We had cockroaches. If your rooms on the ground floor like ours is and there are kids upstairs. Expect to hear everything and not get much sleep. We asked reception to speak to the people above us. As they kept moving furniture and kids woke up at 6am! Reception staff did call them. But nothing changed. They should of offered to move us. Or moved them. Expected a bit better from a 5 star hotel. If you want to sleep by 12 and wake up after 6 ask for a higher floor. The bar staff do need to also smile. It looked like they didn’t want to be…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 July 2018,5,Lovely hotel in good location,"I returned from here last Friday. I had a great time. Drink on arrival while checking in. We had a suite which contained king size bed, grand bathroom and separate wardrobe area. Free safe and fridge which contained water and soft drinks (tea and coffee facilities available too). Never waited long for drinks or to be seated in the restaurant. The three restaurants were lovely with the Moroccan being my favourite. You must try the Moroccan tea! Pool large and activities going on throughout the day and evening entertainment starts at 9:30om or relax in bar area with mellow duo entertainment (piano or guitar). Right on the beech and you can walk along the promenade towards the quay. There are areas for improvement: bed a little hard for my taste and sun beds are taken early…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2018,4,A lovely hotel and had a great time.,"My wife and I stayed here for 11 days over July/August, and we both had a great time. Hotel-no overall concerns here. The lobby, the bars and the restaurants were all very clean and impressive. A little dark, but that's just the style. Room-no complaints here. Good size, clean, daily housekeeping kept everything in check. If I had a couple of minor complaints, its that there is no beer in the mini-bar, and an iron is not provided as standard (you have to go and ask for one from reception) but these are hardly deal breakers for me. Had a brilliant view of the pool and beach. Food/drink-Really good quality and options available at the main buffet for all meals. I've seen some people complain that there's no variety but that's rubbish. There was something different every night…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

All staff and I mean ALL staff are amazing, very attentive and prepared to go above and beyond for their guests. Food was excellent and we utilised all of the al a carte restaurants which I found lovely and to a very high standard. I really couldn’t fault anything regarding our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel if you are wanting good value for money!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2018,2,A disappointing experience. Take diarrhea medicines with you!,"The bad experience begins just about when we arrive at the hotel with the poor welcoming. The reception staff is inefficient and lack of smiles. ""Maybe we are misjudging because of the tiredeness due to the long trip to Morocco"", we are driven to think. But unfortunately the bad service is our companion through all the stay: poor cleaning in the room, no fresh towels, seven days with clogged sink, poor or no entertainment at all (at the leisure areas or in the evening) and 2 speciality restaurants that should have been closed - Krystal and Il Mare. We got a severe diarhea from the food at dinner (we suspect the shrimp at the italian) and when we asked for medicine during the night, We´re told they had none and we should wait for the morning until the Pharmacy was opened.

The room we were allocated smelt of damp so I asked to move. This was done straight away, but to another room that also smelt but less so than the first one. The restaurants were well staffed and service was excellent. The food was slightly repetitive but ok, but we noticed straight away that lots of the food (especially in the lunchtime restaurant) was not hot. On my third day I was unable to leave the room due to a bout of diorroeah. The beach was covered in camel poo which you had to dodge while walking along.

HOTEL - the hotel is as it looks in the pictures, it’s very grand and lush. It has the spa, gym, art studio, huge lobby, cash machine - basically everything you could need. We did the royal hammam - it was amazing. ROOMS - we had a basic room on 3rd floor side street view, it was very spacious always clean. The only small niggle was that there was no direct light in the shower/bath - just found it a bit odd. Couldn’t really fault the room at all it was really nice.

We have been here 5 days and have had 1 afternoon of sunshine. I would say 2 of the days were quite chilly. I am not a Sun worshipper and normally sit in the shade, I have not has to do so on this holiday but after spending over £5000 I would expect to have some sunny days. The pools are massive and very cold as there isn't any sun to warm them. We tried the indoor heated pool as the kids lips were turning blue and tvey were shivering but found that to be just as cold.

EVerything in the hotel is from the best quality. Great drinks and not only local bad stuff. If you ask a glass of bubbles you drink good bubbles and not kind of a kiddybull. Also the red wine that they serve at dinner is from a decent quality and the food is just top. Even the buffet restaurant has the quality of an a-la-carte restaurant.

 July 2018,3,Average hotel with a nicely decorated reception and a big pool. Not 5*,"Firstly, nothing to do with the hotel, but if you're a sunseeker and expecting wall to wall sunshine, then think again! We assumed with it being North Africa and previously visiting Egypt and Tunisia that the weather would be the same, however we only found out when we arrived that the coast of Morocco is very cloudy and misty due to warm air from inland Morocco meeting the cold air over the water in the Atlantic. We had very little sunshine with grey skies and a cold breeze most days apart from 3 out of the 11. By lunch time, it's 50/50 whether the clouds will disperse. Unfortunately for us, out of 11 days, it only cleared up on maybe 4 days. Weather forecasts were predicting mid to late 30's with clear sunshine every day but it just wasn't correct.

 July 2018,4,Ok could be better,work to do The 5 star reviews of this hotel really surprise me. Some people cannot fault it which does confuse me. But as with all these reviews they are based on Personal experience and expectation. First of all I think this is at best a 4 star resort and hotel if it actually sorts is self out. A big point to note is for agadir I believe this hotel is one of the better ones. Something to remember is the rating system is not comparable to 5* in another country. So for agadir / Morocco this hotel may warrant its 5 if it improves  I was originally going to give this 3* but then I realised I maybe makìng comparisons to hotels that use a different system to rate.

The food is reasonable, breakfast was ok, lunch was a hit or miss and dinner was ok too, the restaurant ran out of food creating big queues and the bar ran out of branded drinks!

The hotel is centred around the swimming pool area which is made up of two large swimming pools and one of which has a swim up bar. There is a children’s pool but it’s sectioned off in the kids club area. The kids club is basic but does the job with a little outside play area. The bedrooms are really good and spacious.

Let deal with the restaurant first, I was very surprised to find that there was only one buffet restaurant that severed breakfast and evening meals, so unless you booked the themed you had no choice where to eat. During the day was even worse because there was only the snack bar were to get any lunch, and on more than one occasion we had to queue to get a table for 4.

The food at times was incredible , all different things to match everyone’s tastes. The hotel is very secure and eases any nerves about your safety in this country. The outside areas and the beach were also very safe and relaxed. There are a few people in the area who try a sob story and draw you in to buy but a polite “no thank you” soon gets rid.

 May 2018,5,An excellent all inclusive experience.,"One of my key measures of excellence with all inclusive is whether I'm fed up with the buffet at the end of the week. This time I could have happily stayed for another week. We visited at the end of May (UK half term week) and we all (my wife and 8 year old son) voted it the best of 3 Riu's we've stayed at. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and the room spacious (we had gone for the larger family room offered via Tui). The staff were all really helpful. As well as the quality and variety of the food at the buffet, we appreciated that wine was put on the table in bottles for you to pour when needed (too often I find I either spend most of the meal attracting attention for a refill or fending off waiters who top you up after every sip when they circulate with bottles).

The first impression was great but the rest was just excellent. We have stayed for 11 days at Riu Palace. Our room was big and kept very clean every day. We were given clean towels, fresh fruit and more. The pool area was a bit crowded because the hotel was completely full. We never had a problem to find an empty spot. At times when ti was difficult, we got help from Riu stuff. The restaurants are lovely. There are a ton of options and the menu is rich.

The hotel is set on some beautiful grounds with the beach just on the promenade behind it. The staff were friendly and the service was great especially at the pool side and in the dining room in the evening. The rooms needed a bit of a refurb but overall I recommend this hotel.

Building has beautiful architectural features and grounds, but the service and standard of food let it down. The main restaurants are haphazard and badly managed ; clean plates and cutlery not replenished , food choices running out and substituted with average others, food not hot enough.After 3 days here we have both had a day of upset stomachs. The animation staff are messing around and entertainment is very limited.

 June 2018,1,DO NOT VISIT THIS AWFUL HOTEL!!,"Never ever have I had to leave a bad review for a hotel but our stay at this RIU hotel was absolutely appalling, and I feel like I need to warn others before they choose to stay here. First of all, the staff are all very rude. Unless you’re French you will not get any kind of good service at all. Multiple times we had to speak to reception and management to complain and we got no sympathy whatsoever and got talked down to! Working in customer service myself I found this appalling for a 5* hotel. The food was probably the worst part of this holiday. The first night we stayed at the hotel we ate dinner at the main restaurant and it was ‘Asian night’. After eating what we thought was good food, we went up to bed. At 5am the next morning my boyfriend woke me up being violently…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,5,"Stunning, Great Service!","Recently just came back from a holiday. On first impressions the hotel is beautiful, inside and out. Lots of excursions to chose from. Highly recommend the High Atlas Mountains. Catering staff were tremendous, Marouane was brilliant. Lots of pool space, beds taken pretty quickly! Would recommend the Aqua Aerobics, good start to the day and instructor very nice! Meals were nice, too repetitive at times but nice. Entertainment was great, but could be a little repetitive at time. Animation team were lovely and chatty making the holiday experience wonderful. Great week away!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,5,Amazing!,"It was my first time in Morocco but my cousin had visited last year at the same hotel. It was absolutely amazing! The hotel is beautiful, the food is nice, the staff are are really nice too. A special shout out to Tabtab, he made us feel welcome, he is very polite, funny and friendly! The entertainment is very good too! (I personally preferred the reps shows). Me and my cousin plan on booking again at the end of 2018 so we can come back and see everyone again soon!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,5,excellent place to relax. great Berber hospitality in and around Agadir,great place to relax reception staff are all well trained and very helpful. special mention for Yasin who goes the extra mile to be helpful. good food especially for vegetarians. sea facing so just across the payment to the beach,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,5,"Great Hotel, Great Holiday","What a lovely Hotel and fantastic location which made for a brilliant holiday experiance, We arrived very late in the evening but were greeted by friendly staff, checked in within 5 minutes and our cases taken straight to our room whilst we found our way to the bar. On the 1st morning we went to reception to see if we could change our room as it had no view and we were moved straight away to a lovely room with a nice garden view, so if your not pleased with your room just ask don't complain because the staff are more than happy to help. The pool area at this hotel is brilliant, loads of sun beds and waiters ready to bring you a drink, (you just have to ask). The Hotel is located right on the beach so great for a dip in the sea and for evening walks along the prom, you may get…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,5,I can’t praise this Hotel enough !!,"I stayed at this Hotel firstly at Easter with my husband and daughter. There are many reviews describing the Hotel etc so I don’t need to repeat it all apart from to say that this is one of the best Hotels I have stayed in. So much so that we returned 3 weeks after returning home and have booked again for October. I have to say though that what really makes this Hotel so special is the staff and I want to say a special thank you to Youseff in the lunch time service and the Moroccan restaurant, Zouhier at breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant and Abdo from the bar. These people really made our holiday and I hope to see them on our return.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,4,Nice week break,"My girlfriend and I went for one week and had a lovely one week holiday. Food: Was nice in the buffet but at times very samey. Lots of lamb and seafood. The Krystal restaurant was disappointing and not as good as people make it out to be- food was bang average and felt very pretentious in there.. not for us personally. The Moroccan restaurant was lovely and our favourite meal, we both tried new things and thoroughly enjoy both. The Italian restaurant was nice in that there is the option to sit outside and look out at the beach, which makes a change from the busy buffet restaurant but the foods was basically just the same as it was at lunch and nothing special. Breakfast was great; loads of choice, all really nice. Lunch was nice and so were snacks, but it’s a shame you have to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,5,Best Honneymoon we could have wished for,Amazing Amazing Amazing. From start to finish this place didnt disappoint. Do not listen to people on here moaning they dont have a clue. The hotel knew we were on our honeymoon so gave us a free upgrade to ab amazing suit with a bottle of fizz. What a start. Our rep Natasha was great too!weather was great its cloudy till 12ish then hot hot hot. Beach on your door step and some restaurants on the front are great such as PLAYA AND EL TORO. Restaurants in thr hotel were great food lovely. Best thing is the staff they were amazing. Well be back,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2018,4,An experience,"I would like to start by saying I am writing about my holiday and some of it has no relation to the Hotel. TUI flights from the UK are awful as they are very late going out and late going back. The Moroccan passport control was a joke (over an hour to get through). Arrived around midnight and was processed very quickly, cases were delivered to our room before we got there. Unfortunately I was given a ground floor room which I had asked not to be given however; the next day I was sorted with no fuss and very efficiently moved to a top floor room. The rooms were good and cleaned every day I found the beds very comfortable though the are a little firm. The food is buffet food which did get repetitive and I did not go much on the breakfast even worst if you missed the main breakfast…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2018,1,Far from 5*,"Currently still here in this awful hotel wishing I could just go home. How this hotel has 5 star reviews is beyond me because it’s far from, I’ve stayed in 4 star hotels in Tunisia and it’s been unbelievably better than here. Where do I even start... I always book with first choice (tui) and I have always had the nicest holidays, but this has been the worst experience I have ever had, we flew from Manchester at about 6/7 o’clock as these are the only flight times from the UK we didn’t check in till around 1am. Our flight back isn’t till 11pm tomorrow and we are being collected at 8.45pm. Check out is at 11am so you either have to sit around with luggage for nearly 10 hours or they charge just over £50 to keep your room till 5. I personally think this is ridiculous because we…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2018,5,Absolutely fantastic hotel. Loved it !!!!,"We returned last night after a week stay at this hotel. Absolutely loved it and will definitely be returning! The hotel is about a 30 min transfer from the airport. the hotel looks amazing and beautifully decorated and lit with dark wood and stunning lighting. On arrival check in was seamless, the bags were labelled with our room number and delivered to the room about 10 mins later. We had a ground floor pool side room and again I cannot fault the room at all. They are big and the 2 beds were pushed together and topped with a mattress so it looked and felt like a huge bed. The sheets and pillows are great and very comfortable, the mattress is firm (but thats how I like it!). There is a little seating area with a sofa and table and then some double sliding patio doors that lead…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,3,Disappointing Stay,"Just returned from a disappointing Visit back to this Hotel. On numerous occasions, there was no Soap or Loo Rolls in the Pool Toilets & on one occasion, they were flooded. The Waiters ignored us at the Bar & twice failed to bring the Drinks we ordered at Lunch. Funnily enough, this changed as our Departure neared. I requested a Mattress Protector which was very lumpy & couldn't be used. My elderly Mother had a slight accident one night & the Maid just re-made the Bed the next day & didn't change the Sheet. The Reserving of Beds has become even more ridiculous. By 0730-0800 hrs, there were hardly any Beds left. Towels were put on Beds that were never used throughout the day. One morning, I was awake at 0330 hrs so went to the Pool. Other Towels were already there ! Last year,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,3,Not visiting again.,"Visit two weeks go home Thursday, morrocan and kystal restaurants brilliant but everything from normal food and entertainment terrible. After 10.30 nothing to do.... Smoking well no where for non smokers to sit especially outside either to sit out eat and by the lobby bar where there are two sitting out areas not for non smokers you sit inside sweating also hotel rep no where to be seen not even to come ask how your holiday is etc but don't forget it is a 5* after all.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,5,Perfect!!!!,"I would definitely recomend this hotel to anyone who wants a relaxing holiday with everything you need inside the complex. Absolutely loved the aesthetic of the the hotel from the moment I walked in. The rooms and pool were lovely. Gardens were gorgeous and well maintained. I was impressed by the selection of foods in the buffet, I loved testing all the moroccan dishes. The location was good for activities as well as being basically on the beach. Would definietly stay here again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,4,Beautiful relaxing place,"The hotel is stunning. Feels very luxurious, and the all inclusive adds to that sense. The staff were always super helpful and kind, restaurant could be a bit of a free for all so if you can wait for an outside spot the atmosphere out there was far nicer with great table service for drinks. The food was delicious, breakfast not as good as I had had in other hotels but some really lovely moroccan specialities and the doughnuts were incredible! The pool is beatiful, kept very clean. We did have to svae sunbeds very early in the morning but actually if you did venture down later, a staff member would help you find or arrange one no problem. The entertainment staff were fun and kind and not pushy. The water aerobics was great and evening show always very fun- better than other…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2018,4,Easter Holiday,"We have stayed at various Riu hotels around the world and you can always expect good food, service and amenities and this hotel is not different which is good for the brand. The restaurants are good quality as you would expect but during Easter lunch can get very crowded. The spa is very good and helps to relax after traveling to the resort. There are 2 outdoor pools and 1 is heated although in April the weather can be mixed and neither pool is warm enough for a long swim, this is something that the hotel should address to raise the standards, although there is an indoor pool to use. It’s well worth walking along the promenade down to the Marina. There are plenty of shops and restaurants but Agadir looks and feels a little tired and in need of a revamp. You do get approached by…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,5,Excellent holiday. Definitely return again.,"Just checked out after a week here. If you can't be bothered to read the rest, YES I would recommend and would return again. Reception : Large, spacious, plenty of seating. If you are travelling with TUI fill in the form in your welcome envelope you get at the airport. It will save you time at the reception on arrival. You can change your own currency to local at reception or there is a cash machine inside reception as well if you don't want to carry cash. Room : Large, spacious with step down to small seating area and balcony. Excellent A/C which is nice and quiet, plus additional ceiling fan. Multiple languages on TV. ( For UK it's Ch 14 Sky News, 15 + 16 Pick TV, CH 46 MBA - English films with Arabic subtitles) Restaurants : Main restaurant for Breakfast & Evening meals.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,3,Not as good as the Riu in Aruba,"Brochure advertised branded drinks but these were in very short supply and they ran out of them on a nightly basis. Only had 4 bottles of their equivalent of Baileys to serve each day which the manager put down to the fact that it was Ramadam! 4 types of wine - red, white, rose and sparkling, all of which were a local Moroccan brand. Food did not vary much from day to day and a 5 day wait to book into one of the two a l carte restaurants.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,4,A restful holiday,"My friend and I stayed here for a week, we have been to a Rui hotel before so were confident it would be good.The staff were pleasant and helpful, and the room was big and very clean, towels changed everyday and the sheets Also changed more than once in a week!! THe food was tasty and always plenty of choice a request for aglass of wine with lunch and dinner bought a bottle, and bottles of water, the waiters were always helpful and eager to please. The pool area was clean although a hell of a lot of the sunbeds were covered intowels from early in the morning, yet the pool attendant would find you a couple of beds and an umbrella and set them up for you if asked. The entertainment was awful very poor, but to be fair they were all very young, and when asked about the shows were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,4,Second time around,"We revisited the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida after a 6 year gap! Still an excellent hotel and staff and the grounds are beautiful and well looked after. The rooms to be honest haven’t changed very much at all. My advise is to request an internal room as the hotel forms a ‘u’ the external rooms over look a wide walkway and car parks not the prettiest......... while the internal rooms face the pools and bars, the bars are all closed by sun down so no evening noise. We changed our first room so worth asking..... The rooms themselves are all the same the curtains are really good at blocking the sun so a good nights rest, my husband wasn’t impressed with the bed mattress but it was fine for me (very firm). The tea/coffee facilities are in the wardrobe? This area is dark, as are the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,4,Lush!,"My partner and I stayed here last week (we got home at 3am this morning!); and we have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The hotel and resort of Agadir felt very safe and secure, I’m going to focus my review on the hotel rather than what we did outside the hotel as part of the holiday. The hotel is immaculate and very well kept in the rooms and across the grounds. The service from the hotel staff was absolutely excellent, restaurant, bar, reception and pool staff always trying to ensure everything is ok. People do reserve sun loungers, but we didn’t at all during our stay and whatever time we wanted them we managed to find some. We felt the variety of food was very good, I’m gluten intolerant and always managed to find things I could eat. The buffet restaurant was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,4,"Nice hotel, just a few faults.","Stayed for 2 weeks with my husband from the 31st of May. Overall it is a lovely hotel but there are some bad points. First the good-grounds are beautiful and immaculately kept, reception is very large and staff were friendly on arrival and check in. The room we were given was on the ground floor with only a view of the road and car park. When we looked around we noticed cockroaches, at least 9 of them, all seemed to be not moving and on their back so possibly had been killed previously. I didn’t want to stay in the room so we went back to reception, they were apologetic and we were given one on the third floor with pool and sea view and we didn’t see another cockroach for the duration of our stay. The pool area is great, sunbeds do get reserved but we always managed to find one…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The pool area and bar are stunning and the sun beds are very comfortable and there's plenty of them to go around (although you do have to be early to get them) The food was plentiful, tasty and the signature dishes varied every night which was lovely!!

 June 2018,5,Just fabulous!!,This was our first family holiday with our 10 month old baby and as such we were anxious about pretty much everything before we left our house! We honestly worried for nothing because the holiday was just perfect from start to finish. The room was fabulous and the cot was already set up ready for us. Kettle and bottled water in the room for making bottles up. We were worried about the two steps in the room (split level from bed and sitting area) because she's crawling and the floors are all ceramic tiles but she was fine and even mastered climbing up them all by herself. We were on the 2nd floor and worried about her not sleeping because of noise complaints on other reviews but again we had no issues.

 June 2018,5,A top top hotel,I have to start with a massive WOW this place is out of this world . The staff were so friendly and welcoming and extremely helpful . The pool area was amazing even if the pool was a tad chilly but I didn't mind it kept me cool in the heat . The food was exceptional and you couldn't fault it . I came down to breakfast wearing and morroccan football shirt the day of the game and received a great welcome from all the staff . The accommodation is very comfortable and spacious we had a pool side view and could see the sea too I like to thank all the staff for treating us well with a first class service we are already looking to return next year .,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,4,Wonderful,Just what the doctor ordered. A lovely break exactly what I would. Expect based on the brochures... Too often can you be mis-sold not in this case... The only thing I would have liked more of could not be controlled by the hotel and that was the weather. Very overcast for allot of the holiday and did get quite chilly despite being the middle of the summer. Nice easy walks along the beach front suitable for prams/wheelchairs. Would I recommend the hotel.. Yes,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,3,Damp musty smell in room,"Just returned from a weeks holiday. Hotel grounds are excellent, very well maintained with beautiful flowers. You might even spot the hotel tortoise pottering about. The food is plentiful with lots to choose from with different dishes every day. Always hot and fresh There is a mini bar in the room re- stocked every day with water, beer, fanta and cola. The hotel reception will exchange money into Dirham if neded. The exchange rate is very good and will exchange dirhams back to pounds, again with a good rate. All the staff are fantastic and go the extra to make your holiday complete. Would recommend the Tui excursion around Agadir. The visit to the souk is an experiance, be prepared to haggle. The orange taxis are a cheap way to get about. These have meters.

 June 2018,3,Average. Wouldn’t come back,"Hotel is nice, clean but very boring. Never any music on apart from the shows on a night, weather has been dull so it’s extra morbid. Staff are good and helpful. Stayed in Riu hotels in other places and this is the worst for food. Buffet is boring same food every day and night no salmon at breakfast like the others. Rooms are spacious which is good because we’ve been in ours a lot with the rubbish weather and no activities to keep us entertained. Make sure to bring trousers if male for every night as very strict they will let you in with joggers but not smart shorts? Can’t understand that myself but whatever",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Both our children have been before and so we had high expectations of the hotel and were not disappointed. We had a 4th floor room overlooking the pool and beach which was spacious, comfortable and kept very well by the cleaning staff. The food was very good with a large selection of meats, fish, salads, vegetables including local Moroccan dishes. Our only complaint was a mix up by the hotel on our bookings for the Moroccan and Krystal Restaurants which meant we didn’t make the Krystal whilst we were there. However the other restaurant was really good so its not a major issue but does need sorting by the staff as we booked the 2 restaurants on our 1st day to avoid any disappointment. It didn’t really spoil the holiday…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Having said that, undercooked meats should not happen in the first place.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,5,Fantastic,"We have just come home after spending a week here. We thought it was a fabulous hotel and would highly recommend it. Food was great (and I’m a fussy eater!)

We felt so relaxed that we couldn't even be bothered to go on any of the organised trips from the tour operator. On arrival we were welcomed by the staff with a cocktail and the booking in process at reception was very smooth. Due to the time we arrived we were given our room details and a label was put on our luggage for the porter to take to the room while we visited the restaurant for something to eat.

I’ll start with some positives - the rooms are spacious and clean. The bar staff are friendly and professional. The animation team are also very friendly and engaging. The lobby is very comfortable and stylish. The WiFi was very reliable and accessible by the pool. The fish available is delicious and well cooked. Now to the negatives...

 May 2018,3,Okay but not great,"Went on holiday with a friend for a bit of RnR. It’s classed as a five star hotel but you know not to expect UK standard five star. So with our expectations set and Tripadvisor reviews read, we set off for our 10 day break. It was a relaxing break, the weather was hot in the day (really quite cool in the evenings) and there was food and drink aplenty. Prosecco was on tap and the local gin wasn’t bad at all. Our room was a good size and bed and pillows were comfy, so sleep came easily. However, there are really irritating things that are slightly awry with this hotel that you should know before you book. 1. Not enough beach towels for everyone. EVERY DAY of our holiday we went to get a clean towel and there weren’t any. We kept being told “5 minutes” so just be sure you keep…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I would like to mention the excellent service from Hamza and his colleague Brahmin ( sorry if I’ve spelt that wrongly) who served us many times in the outdoor restaurant ( thank you for putting the heater on for me !) I have no complaints about the hotel at all however just wanted to post something about the surrounding area. I appreciate this review should be about the hotel but had I known what Agadir was like I wouldn’t have booked.

Bar staff and drinks were excellent, pool staff helpful and efficient. This hotel in my opinion is hard to beat.All the staff are a real credit to this hotel.

 May 2018,5,True 5*,"Not many 5* resorts are actual 5* when you arrive but this was. The hotel, the service, the rooms, everything. We took our 15month old son and he was treated like royalty the whole week. They can't do enough for you. Warming milk and food if needed. Plenty of shade round the pool, perfect for little children. The children's area was cute, we needed no more. Olives and nuts with drinks is a wonderful touch. Food was varied and tasty (too tasty) alcohol also good as branded included. Agadir as a resort is very clean, windy and a bit of hassling outside the hotel but not too much.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,5,Excellent,"Absolutely lovely hotel, start to finish. On arrival bags taken to room whilst we had a drink after a long day travelling. Room was very spacious with a designated seating are and was spotless no view though slightly disappointing. Next morning we heard water and thought someone having a very long shower, opened the door to see a waterfall outside our room......... All meals we could not fault. Vast choice, catered for every need and all was delicious. In the main bar there were branded drinks, very nice and decent cocktails. The pool area was very spacious and the pool boys would find you a padded sunbed with an umberella. Staff were excellent and considering it was Ramadan we’re sll in good humour. You step out on to the promenade then onto the beach where there are lucky men…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,5,As good as ever,"Not long got back from the riu tikida palace again. As ever I had such a wonderful time. Fantastic service, fantastic staff.

 June 2018,5,Amazing hotel and staff,"We ar currently staying at this hotel and it has been nothing but amazing! The staff are by far the best thing about this place! They can not do enough for you. I am here with my patenter as our last holiday just the two of us, as we are currently pregnant. When arriving at the hotel the reception staff offered by partner the option to have flowers sent to or room for myself , a night in one of the restaurants with all the extras , and even gave us he option of which room we would prefer to make our stay easier for myself! The same receptionist has since called our room to make sure I liked my flowers (how thoughtful!) Everything we have asked for has been done within the hour and to a high standard! The hotel itself is beautiful, well maintained and has everything…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2018,5,Exceeded my expectations!!,What a place! Definitely one of the best places I've stayed if not the best! Food is great the staff are lovely and the hotel is unbelievably clean.

 May 2018,1,Worst place I’ve been to date,I’ve traveled the world but I i’ve to say this has to the worst to date. Book this hotel for my birthday for seven days and lasted 3 day. Started noticing from the get go at breakfast not being serve a table or tea an coffee just completely blunted. Now ordinary I wouldn’t give this a thought but has a black man watch other waiters and waitresses pass us by but severing the White guests this had me slightly confused. This happened every day for the three days I was there The bed room was no better this is a 5* hotel no iron Or ironing board for three hours. The room had ants all over it I asked to be moved the netted day which the said they would did I move hell no Sunday was football the sad lost in the game but that life sometimes come down in my shorts to watch it…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,3,Not what expected,Before going here I looked at lots of reviews and a lot of them were saying how fantastic the food was this was one of the reasons I chose this hotel but the food wasn’t great average at best .We ate out a lot of the time very repetitive .The actual hotel and grounds was lovely and the staff were fantastic I would stay again but just take extra money for eating out,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Lovely sunny week in feb,"Sorry for the late review, we went here in early February 2018; for a week and had an absolulty wonderful time, it’s our 2nd time in agadir first to this hotel and its lovely and the staff are all so helpful, Mohammad our waiter gave my daughter a pot of honey when she had a sore throat, and our waitress bought her a gift of a headband as she noticed she always wears one. The only negative thing is that my daughter has mobility issues and the pool only has ladder style steps into it so sadly she didn’t use the pool all week but did manage to get into the jacuzzi, it’s a new pool area and it wouldn’t take much to make it disabled friendly, other than that it’s all lovely but I think if we go to agadir again it’d be to the riu beach it’s better accessibility for my daughter.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,5,Lovely week at a great hotel,"We’ve just returned from a week at the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida in Agadir and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is specious and immaculately clean. There is security on the front doors and also on the beach entrance - not sure if this is necessary but it adds to the safety factor. There are numerous people that we could mention:- the reception staff were really helpful, we had to ask for our twin bed to be made into a double and also ask for a mattress topper to be added to our bed as we found it rather hard - both were done immediately, which was great. Also the housekeeping did extra touches to make our room more special when we returned after a day at the pool, and all of the staff in the restaurant and bars were very good and friendly. We chatted to one young man at the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,2,If you want to be treated like a 2nd class citizen don't go here!!!!!,"I visited this hotel on a all inclusive basis and I was disgraced at the racism and differential treatment towards me and a friend. The staff ignored us during mealtimes assisting German families for e.g. In the restaurant we was told my friend could not enter as he had shorts on , yet we spotted many people already in there with shorts, when we challenged this we was bombarded by many staff and the manager disregarded this although we showed pictures of individuals in shorts. During each visit to the restaurant we would have to ask for water to be at our table, no waiter would come to make sure everything was fine yet we observed staff puttin flowers on table, pots of coffee, yet we was left to assist ourselves.

After an eventful flight were the plane almost got diverted due to unruly passengers (well done cabin crew) we arrived at the Takida Palace were immediately we saw how it passed as a Palace...mind you all Riu's that we've been to have been are good to say the least. Lovely room with a view of the sea. Balcony, personal safe, fully equipped bathroom and once again a comfortable bed...where do Riu's get them? I want one! Room was maintained brilliantly by the staff. Also lovely and cool with AC and a ceiling fan. Food was amazing with excellent choice, I honestly believe you could eat something different each meal for months....this we've found is typical Riu. The Moroccan tagines were gorgeous!…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,5,Fab hotel complex great rooms wonderful food,"I have been to Morocco before and to Marrakech but this Rui really was the business the food was superb and the service was truly great there was an amazing amount of fish and meat dishes on offer easily as good as any cruise ship I have been on ,if you asked for wine they always opened fresh bottles ,red or white was both good lager was very nice on offer almost 24hrs ,I would have no hesitation in recommending this complex to anyone ,the only downside was that the food was so good I ate too much.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,5,Great couple holiday!!,"First holiday away without the kids and we were not disappointed. I am writing this from the suite looking out to the sea. We have loved everyday here and the week has flown and we will be sorry to pack our bags. The suite is beautiful, well furnished and maintained to a high standard. Fridge and kettle included. Safe is also free to use!! The staff are welcoming and cannot do enough for you. Agadir has a lovely marina if you fancy a walk out...not many shops but Zara and Mac for the ladies. Yes there are sellers along the promenade but they easily and politely take no for an answer. The hotel shop is quite expensive if you forgot the basics such as after sun.

 May 2018,5,excellent riu hotel,Just coming to the end of a relaxing week in the sun. Hotel better than anticipated great service throughout and very pleasant staff. Excellent choice of food everyday and drinks good. Have stayed in many riu hotels and this is on par with them. 24hr security around hotel safe and no problems . Out on the promenade you can enjoy a nice walk but you do get hassled a little buy the local sellers .... same as everywhere a polite no thanks is sufficient. We would return to the same hotel no problem for a very reasonably cheap week away,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2018,5,Brilliant stay,"We have just arrived back from a week stay here. The hotel was fantastic! Very clean and staff were very welcoming. I would advise having cash ready as the bell boy expects a tip (even though it is his job) to bring the bags to your room. All restaurants require men to wear long trousers for dinnertime however women seem to be able to wear whatever they want! You need to get up relatively early to get decent sunbeams, we were up at 7am and struggled to find beds some mornings, so if you like to have the same beds each day i'd get an early night! The food was excellent, everything was cooked fantastically and there was a huge variety each day and a great selection of savoury and sweet each day. The pool is pretty chilly due to the size so isn't overly comfortable until…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2017,5,"Impeccable Service, Fantastic Location and Spacious Rooms.","This hotel is a must for anyone that is planning a Winter Break. We booked an all inclusive holiday with TUI for 10 nights at this 5* hotel. The moment we arrived we were given a friendly welcome and made to feel at home. The rooms are very spacious with a double bed and even a ‘living space’ with a sofa. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the hotel was always immaculate even in the most obscure places. The all inclusive drinks included branded products which meant we could enjoy high quality cocktails and champagne throughout the duration of our stay. The Weather something which we heard mixed reviews about was never an issue.

 February 2018,5,A perfect retreat for a hotel based stay,"I visited this hotel back in early February so apologies for the delay in posting. Like most of the other reviewers I was extremely impressed with the hotel and the staff. I found it to be a very relaxing hotel and never had a issue getting a great spot beside the pool at any time of the day. Maybe this differs during the summer season but for a winter break it was perfect. The food offered by the hotel is as good as any I have had. We were particularly impressed with the Krystal restaurant that you can book separately - it is very well worth making a reservation here early on during your stay as it can get booked up. The only issue I had was how close the tables are in the main buffet restaurant. Personally, I like a bit of the space from the people adjacent to me but it…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 May 2018,3,Family Holiday,"We came here in November last year,and enjoyed our stay. So wanted to bring our boys here as a treat in between there University break. Unfortunately we noticed a complete lack of customer care, at times in the morning breakfast time and senior management when told our two sons couldn’t enter the restaurant in the evening with shorts on, however smart !! They only had shorts as well ,the assistant manager at first was extremely aggressive towards us as we tried to explain that there was no mention of this when we booked and that my husband had warm shorts as others, seven months ago no problem ! Instead of being apologetic regarding the so called new rule. He proceeded to question whether we had ever stayed in a 5 star hotel before !! This was our first night too.

 May 2018,5,Another relaxing week in the sunshine,"Our eighth visit to this lovely hotel for a week of sun and rest. Consistent as ever, fabulous service at supper and from the bar team, breakfast and lunch staff were not so good. Breakfast staff seem more disorganised, start laying up tables or getting your coffee then disappear... a grumble not a complaint. We do love it here! I would love to see some of the pool area designated as non smoking, it’s so frustrating having got up at 6.15am (yes sunbed gate is very present here!) to get the area you like and then be surrounded by smokers who want their unpleasant poison in your direction for hours. So much so that o get a sore throat after just two hours & have to move away. Please Tikidi Palace do something about this?",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Well worth going to the fusion restaurant in the hotel, cracking food! The general area was a bit run down but the hotel was a slice of paradise.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Rooms are spacious and have a mini fridge that is stocked daily. Our maid for room 2099 was amazing and very patient with us on our sunburnt days!l and deserves a mention as she works so hard day after day. The hotel itself is very plush and the lobby area is gorgeous, the pool is freezing which sometimes went against you if you fancied a morning dip! The beer is good, the named spirits sometimes run out but there is plenty of others to go round and prosecco on tap day and night. The food was good but, strangely for a family hotel, there was not a children’s section, which is my only criticism really.

The pools are pleasant, child friendly and complete with a swim up bar. The excursions are well run, we completed the half day Atlas trail, it as a great insight into traditional Moroccan life. Our guide Ahmed, was highly enthusiastic and worth every penny. Probably not great for anyone with mobility issues though as there are a few scrambly bits on the walk.

The food is nice something for everyone, restaurant staff are brilliant, can’t say the same about the bar staff (they seem to be sniggering and talking about you whilst serving you, which can be very intimidating). As for the branded drinks, we have stayed in many Riu hotels & Palaces worldwide and have never not had branded drinks, the whole week we was there we was told they had run out, really 5star hotel running out of branded drink very poor.

Every single member of staff is so friendly, which makes the atmosphere really comfortable, we gave our maid a tip with all our change left over because she was the sweetest and left our room clean everyday throughout our stay. We met a really nice gentleman also that made us feel welcome (Ebrahim) and constantly asked after us, which we also left money for.

As a vegetarian, and as someone who went in a group, this resort not only accommodated our needs, but had everything that we wanted. From excellent food in the morning through to dinner, to entertainment in the evening, this was by far the best holiday I have had. Food Was excellent.

During the day the pool beds were very comfortable and there are plenty of different places to sit in the evening listening to the entairtainment or not whatever suits you. It is the staff that makes the hotel. Every one person was pleasant from reception, bar staff, waiters, cleaners, gardeners and entertainment staff.

So many of the staff remembered us which was great. This is what makes the hotel as good as it is and the number of repeat customers surprised us. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff to do for you, which makes it an absolute pleasure to be at the hotel. The food selection was different every night. Even the Chef makes an appearance every night and talks to the customers. We had one visit to the Krystal a'la carte which was so good and could not fault anything.

The staff are so helpful and welcoming. Almost every day there are 2 shows ( Dancing, circus, singing) . The rooms are really spacious, tidy and clean. The weather is great as it is not too hot or too cold and apparently it’s like that most of the year (can be a bit cold to swim outside sometimes) There is a heated pool indoors and outdoors. The food was my favourite with so much variety. Our kids loved the kids club. There are also lots of places to visit in and around Agadir. A day trip to Marrakech was Ideal.

The pool area, general areas and rooms are immaculate and in such good condition and decor! The staff cannot do enough for you whether they work in the bar, restaurant or even the night porter at the door!! My ONLY criticism is the entertainment and lack of it! The ‘Main Show’ ended at 10-30pm-ish after being on for 40mins/1hr max and then there was nothing except for a man on a keyboard in the piano bar! The hotel would benefit for some music after the main show as our group found the ‘entertainment’ as a whole really poor!

 April 2018,5,Fantastic,The hotel was one of the best we have stayed in. The cleanliness of the hotel in all areas was second to none. The staff were great and very helpful. There was never a problem with getting sunbeds. The choice of food was amazing both at lunch and dinner. There was something for every taste. We were on the 4th floor on the odd number side (4049) and didn't get any sun on the balcony at all which spoilt it a little for us as when on holiday we usually go to our room at around 3.00pm and relax on the balcony before getting ready for dinner. As for entertainment in the evening - well we were really disappointed and only went in once as it was very off-putting trying to watch a show with a screen on either side of the stage showing sports.

I asked for a room with a sunny balcony and got a lovely room on the 4th floor with a sea view. We enjoyed playing bingo with the fantastic YoYo, who also showed us some card tricks.

 April 2018,5,Amazing,I read the reviews and probably wouldn’t have come here but my friend was here a couple of weeks back and was raving about it. I don’t know how anyone could complain about this lovely hotel. The staff are amazing they bend over backwards to accommodate your every need. it’s spotlessly clean they are constantly cleaning and gardening. The food is delicious and so much choice. The wine is top notch. Pool Sunbed’s brilliant. Great walks along the prom you feel safe. Few beggars and the obvious lookie lookie men pestering you in abundance. It’s like being in Dubai without the hefty charges. I have one complain I wished I’d booked for two weeks truly found a gem here we will be back.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2018,3,Disappointing,"Despite what you might read this is at best a 3 star Hotel. Its true that the staff are on the whole very helpful and the rooms are adequate, but that's where the postives end. Dining here is an experience , you do have some choice , you can visit the school canteen type main dining room, or the two other restaurants offering Fusion Dishes or Moroccan Specialities. The reality is that there's not much difference in the type of dish although the two specialist restaurants are slightly smaller. Despite the hotel being all inclusive I had expected there to be the opportunity to upgrade from the supplied wine list to a better option, that's not available. Despite offering a menu showing bottled beer, that is only available in the main dining room. Also don't put your plate down…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Have to say though whilst all facilities in the room were there I can’t stand hairdryers that are attached to the wall........... really annoying?! Food and drink was really good, a lot of French holiday here and I think that is reflected in the restaurants. The patisserie selections breakfast, lunch and dinner were amazing and very good!

 April 2018,5,"Lovely hotel, great setting and friendly staff","Hotel is lovely, food is plentiful and very good and there's prosecco on tap 24 hours a day! If I had a couple of moans, one would be that while there were plenty of sunbeds around the pool and loads of space, there was a distinct lack of sunbed cushions. There are fixed concrete beds spread around the pool area but about 50% were unusable due to there being no cushions and the pool attendants regularly took cushions off unused beds to give to other guests. More than once this caused friction that could have been avoided if there were just more cushions! Secondly, the hotel rooms are very dark, even with all the lights on but apart from that I would definitely come back",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,4,Friendly staff and clean rooms.,"Plenty of reception staff and quick check in. Room very big with large balcony, I loved the big bath. We did keep running out of milk, but were replaced as soon as advised. Furniture in the room is very large and bruised my leg on the bedside unit several times. There was a lack of drawers, but lots of space where they could have put some. Rooms cleaned daily with always a pattern made with the covers etc, Food was good, especially the desserts, and plenty of fish dishes. Wine served with evening meal. Activities were good, aquasize every day, Pilates,Zumba, relax, French bowls, darts etc. We went to the evening shows but they weren’t well supported, but they were ok. I would have liked more music after the entertainment so we could have had a bit of dancing, but as soon as…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,4,Great Holiday,"This was our first holiday to Morocco and to a Riu Hotel, and the overall experience was lovely. The hotel itself is nice, however we did find it a bit soulless and didn’t feel very Moroccan - everything was brown and dark, no bright colours, and unfortunately there wasn't any Moroccan music playing in the background - so really you could have been anywhere. The hotel was also a bit tired around the edges - maybe it just needs a bit of a makeover. The very large reception area is very dark, and through the corridors is dark too. The rooms are nice and of a good size. Take your own toiletries though, because they only supply a small amount. One thing you will have, if you have a sea front room, then be warned - the dogs on the beach decide about 5am that it's time for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,5,Love at first sight,"Tikida palace is probably the most beautiful hotel that I’ve ever stayed at the service is absolutely impeccable and the landscapes are to die for! I’ve never felt more at home on holiday before I made friends for life with some of the staff there and months later I’m still in contact with most of them and we speak on a daily basis. There’s more food than you could ever wish for and the range is amazing, I am an extremely picky eater but trust me there wasn’t any day that I was going hungry as there was so much choice. The staff are always so friendly and go out of their way to make you feel at ease, by the second day that I was there I think all the staff knew me by my name and there was nothing they wouldn’t do for you. In the day there were endless things to do such as…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,5,Can't wait to visit again!,"Amazing! from the moment we checked in to when we checked out! Great food, good drink selection, great outdoor areas, lovely pool and fitness room. As for the staff, very friendly and professional, the likes of Ahmed (in the picture) Hamanda, and Faysal (who were mainly in the lobby bar) really looked after us and deserve recognition. Resturant staff were also great! The only slight negative was the Spa, the interior etc was very nice, but the actual treatment we had was not worth the money we paid. Overall, great hotel, definitely worth a visit, we'll be going back for sure!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,3,Hit and miss and 4 star not 5,"A good hotel but not a great hotel. Had lots of good points but realy not up to the standard it should be, quite a few things let it down. First impressions are amazing, the foyer is massive and lots of comfy seating that gets quite full at night's, which made for a nice place to sit and enjoy a drink listening to the live music, more relaxed than the entertainment in the main theatre room. The bar is open 24hrs but sadly the cocktails are poor quality. The foyer and restaurant are realy very dark, cost but got on my nerves after a while. The breakfast is very good quality and a lot of choice, fruit is fresh and so are the various juices, not a great selection of cereal but great cooked produce etc. Lunch was like a canteen but good very Good, evening good food was good…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,3,Disappointing holiday,I had to change room three times for various problems with the rooms. The restaurants at lunch are more like a school canteen. Queuing and loud! You had to be up earlier in order to get a sunbed. The beach was not great either..CONSTANT pestering by sellers. The staff on reception were not great but the waiters were lovely and attentive.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2017,5,2nd time but NOT our last,"Our 2nd visit to the Rui palace tikida agadir, we loved it yet again. Staff were so helpful and friendly. Food in the buffet was superb with such a vast selection come morning noon and night. We had a couple of meals in the al a carte restaurants and in fairness was a little disappointed with Krystal this time. We asked for a quiet room with pool/ sea views and got a top floor room at the end of the corridor ( opposite our previous room ) . Rooms are very spacious, clean, tidy and comfortable. Mini bar is well stocked and overfilled with bottles of water. We'll be back here in the next couple of years !!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,4,Relaxing Winter Break,"There were highs and lows, but the highs definitely outweighed the lows. Visited for 10 days end of March to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Winter sun only 3 hour flight, what a bonus. Hotel immaculate, with superb views from our balcony(room 4130). Swimming pool area was good with plenty of sunbeds, though if you wanted your favourite spot you would need to get up early. The sunbeds by the pool were very comfortable which could not be said for the beach sunbeds which were distinctly uncomfortable which put us off using the beach. Wonderful promenade to walk along, very safe, flat and not over bothered by locals selling their wares, mainly sunglasses. Most of the staff were excellent, hard working and friendly especially Hannan and Imad. The quality of the food was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2018,5,Amazing hotel! Highly recommended!,"We stayed at this hotel for one week over Easter it was our first visit to Agadir and I must say the staff here made us feel very welcome. I would like to do a special shoutout to Imad he was my favourite bar man, along with Halim & Mostapha. The animation team were so lovely and I’m blown away by the kindness of the Moroccan staff at this hotel they are always smiling and happy I would definitely return here again. I would recommend the Moroccan restaurant as the food was fantastic, Brahim was our waiter and he cracked us up very funny good banter. The food in general was delicious there was lots to choose from and the interior of the hotel is very grand, huge hotel and the bedroom was perfect. We were very satisfied with our stay here and this hotel definitely is a 5* service.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,5,Amazing Hotel,Just returned from a weeks stay at this hotel. We have stayed at quite a few other Rui hotels and this is by far the best. The staff are so pleasant and happy. The food selection at all meals was amazing. The pool area is very good. The room was gorgeous. There are so many areas to relax in. Outside the hotel is a wide promenade about 5km long which is great for running. There are a lot of people out exercising. We will definitely be planning another stay.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,4,Anniversary trip,"My husband and I went to this hotel as a treat for our Golden wedding anniversary. We don't normally go anywhere so early in the year but due to the excellent reviews we chose this one. Arriving at the hotel I was rather overwhelmed at how big it is. Checking in was a very easy process and we were in time for the evening meal. The food is very good. Breakfast and the evening meal are served in Le Santal restaurant. Excellent choice and most of it is cooked in front of you. Lunch, late continental breakfast and snacks in the afternoon are in the Il Mare. The Krystal restaurant for special bookings has two services and we did book one for our anniversary meal but unfortunately we had to cancel this. Most people we spoke to who had been said it was very good, so all in all I cannot…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,5,Great food great week,"Second time to this hotel so we knew what to expect, we don’t return anywhere we don’t consider good. The food in the main restaurant is excellent great choice something for all tastes. We didn’t eat in the smaller restaurants this time we didn’t feel we could better what we were getting. The bar service is good if a little slow at busy times. The entertainment crew were energetic and included everyone in greetings and activities but luckily they weren’t to pushy. The promenade along the front is wonderful, we walked from the Hotel every morning for a couple of miles but you could extend that to twice that much. The locals were friendly and only a very few Hawkers selling locally made crafts. All in all a great place to stay the only downside is the airport and getting through…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,4,Almost Relaxing!!!,"The check in at this hotel is from 3pm and the check out is 11am, just so that you are aware not to expect to automatically get into your room when you arrive as we didn’t get our room until 4pm. I guess if we hadn’t been up since 2 am and were quite tired this wouldn’t have been so bad. This hotel is very large but well planned and in general you do not get any noise from the rooms. The cleanliness of the rooms is good, just a little more attention could be paid to the area of the tiling and bath seals as these were decidedly grimy. If I’d had an old tooth brush with me I could have scraped it out myself!!! The food was excellent, with plenty to choose from at every mealtime. The wine is served by the bottle, unlike a lot of All Inclusive’s where you’re given a glass and you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,5,Yet another fabulous visit to the Tikida Palace,We have just returned home for our 3rd visit to the Riu Tikida Palace hotline Agadir. Yet another wonderful trip enjoyed to the full. We found excellent food and services at the hotel as always . No complaints . It had to be said we love this hotel and have never been let down by any of the staff or the services offered. The food is wonderful. It anything can be said to fault our holiday it would not be the hotel or staff but maybe some of the other guests. We did have a couple of very large groups of guests ruling the pool area and making a lot of noise and they seemed the think nobody understood what they were saying about the English. Shall we just say they were wrong and we didn't allow their ignorance to effect our stay what so ever. Quite amusing for them to assume…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2018,5,Oh My,"Sat here on our last full day. This is our seventh visit and each time we are made to feel like family and very welcome. There is not one member of staff that doesn’t make you feel like you are a long lost friend. The hotel is very clean and the rooms huge as standard, soft drinks and water stocked in mini bar. Restaurant is very well presented and has a dress code for gentlemen ( long trousers in evening) the food is great but a little repetitive... not something that would spoil the holiday. The Krystal Fusion restaurant is beautifully presented and both service and food was excellent. Animation team work tirelessly and go all out to make your stay as active or relaxing as you want. Yousef in particular is one of the loveliest people you could hope to meet. Mr Fitness “Said”…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2018,5,Perfect at this time of year,As a vegetarian abroad I’m always wary of all inclusive but at this hotel there is a huge range and very well cooked. At the booking restaurants they made specific veggie food not on the menu which was tasty. As an area the hotel looks out to not the beach and the pools are large and warm enough. The drinks are available from 10am by the pool or 24h in the lobby. My favourite parts are at about 8.15 each night they put on some dancing in the lobby which at times was incredible! Very clean all round and they let ok after everything very well. The main thing that is fabulous about the hotel are the staff and they couldn’t be friendlier and more helpful if they tried! We had our two year old with us who they simply adored! I even played football on the beach with the locals on the…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,3,Early Break Away,We just got back from a weeks stay at this hotel. First impressions were good as we got upgraded to a suite which was massive. When you arrive at the airport you have to queue for about a hour to get your passport stamped. We were unable to get a sun bed around the pool as these were all reserved when we went to breakfast which we thought was not allowed but no one seemed to remove them. We found the private beach much better anyway as there was more room and less people there and as we had a suite we had our own sun beds so when the sun came round we spent the afternoons there. The hotel is massive with very long corridors. Towards the end of the week we noticed more kids which seemed to be allowed to run around everywhere with no one watching them or telling them off. Was ok…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,3,Not a 5 Star at all,"I don’t usually write reviews but feel it is necessary for this hotel. They claim to be a 5 Star but are far from it. I have been lucky enough to stay at 5 Star resorts in Mexico, Jamaica and Dominican Republic, London etc over the years so I know a good hotel when I see one. Cons- Food poor same food every day, pasta, chicken, pizza, chips only varies slightly. Breakfast ok. Must say desserts are nice Dining rooms are just big free for all’s, not taken to your seats, you have to find one that is vacant which often you are waiting to be cleared. Very busy places all will get worse as the season goes on and the place gets busier. Drinks ok, beer not too bad. Had a couple that tasted chemically. Wife liked the cocktails, and rose wine with the dinner. Pool beds, even before…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,5,Beautiful hotel and service.,"Just returned from a week at this excellent example of the RIU Palace quality. From check in to check out, the quality of service, food and accommodation was first class. We never tried the speciality restaurants, as the choice and quality in the buffet restaurant was superb. Good choices of seafood, meats and speciality Moroccan dishes every lunch and evening. The choice at breakfast was equally impressive. We have visited many RIU hotels around the world, but this one has the edge. The management are visible and approachable, and keep an eye on everything to ensure that you receive the best possible service. ALL the staff are very pleasant and cannot help you enough. There are so many of the staff that really went out of their way to make us happy and comfortable that it would…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Thank you so much RIU X,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,5,5star excellence,All round excellence All the personnel were very attentive and helpful. The huge restaurant very busy but never seemed overcrowded. Masses of excellent food and wine on my all inclusive holiday. Large bedrooms more like a mini suite kept spotless. YES I would certainly recommend for a relaxing stay,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2017,5,Lovely stay at the end of October,"The all inclusive was a very good value for money. The food was fresh and the staff very pleasant. The drinks could be improved. Our 3 year old loved the pool despite it being on a slightly cool side. BTW they love kids in Morocco. The room was spacious, very clean with a separate sofa bed for the baby. My hammam experience was much nicer than the one recommended outside of the hotel despite only slightly higher price. If you want luxury have it done in the hotel, if you want an experience get one on the outside, which includes a hairy ride in the taxi :) Walked to the nearby Zoo (some lf the animals are not in the best shape) and along the promenade most evenings. People were very friendly. The weather at the end of October was really nice in the day but a bit cool in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,4,Good week in the sun,"My husband and I had a week here just before the masses arrive for Easter. We weren’t expecting much other than somewhere warm where we could lie by the pool and it ticked those boxes! The food was nice, not amazing - some days better than others but kind of what you can expect in the all inclusive buffet style offering. We ate at both a la carte restaurants but Crystal was definitely the better one which is a shame as you would think in Morocco, the Moroccan should be! The Moroccan restaurant serves the meat tagine dish but the chicken didn’t come with anything other than chicken!!!! We never drink local wine in all inclusive resorts but the local wine was actually quite nice. Staff are friendly and there is no gawking at the women which some may expect and in fact, the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,3,"Excellent staff, dangerous poolside!","On a positive note, we found all staff at the hotel to be helpful courteous and friendly however the hotel failed to impress in other areas. In particular the general fabric of the external hotel was poor. Most alarming was the broken floor tiles around pool area (see photo). These broken tiles presented sharp edges which could easily cause injury to bare feet. I would conservatively estimate at least 50 locations around the poolside which had broken tiles and would not be at all surprised if the actual number exceeded 100. Some of the tiles had been patch repaired so it would appear to be a known problem. Additionally we found flaking paintwork and damaged poolside furniture. The food was generally ok but not exceptional. Some roast chicken I tried was so dry it was practically…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2018,5,Our 5th stay at this wonderful hotel & amazing staff,"Firstly I must admit that when we saw the Palace being built to me it just seemed way too big. However, despite there being 100's or rooms the hotel absorbs everyone and there are still many places to escape to if you feel the need. Been back for the 5th stay at the Palace. The rooms we've stayed in have all been very spacious and very well kitted-out. The daily maid service has always been excellent and the room is always very clean & tidy. All the staff at the hotel are very friendly. Always wide smiles & lovely greetings. We have always been very well looked after.

The facilities were fantastic and the all inclusive a great option with lovely food and fantastic service.

We were told to go back to bed by the maintenance team as the hotel was full, it’s not very comfortable having a wet towel at the end of your bed as you had to dry your feet to get in!!!! Shortly after the electric went so now we were in the dark and the room was very cold and damp.

The hotel is spacious and clean with plenty of seats and tables around the bar and Reception area. The drinks are good with a wide selection. The dining room at breakfast and evening time is located next to Reception where the food is good and varied. The lunch time buffet is served near the pool area and is less formal but food still very good. The staff are very polite and work extremely hard.

One of the entertainment team called tabtab was amazing very friendly always making sure we had everything we needed and great to talk to he made the holiday that little be more special for us all.

The food for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and evening meals are very well presented, very varied, tasty and well cooked, even to the point the cook will adjust to meet your requests. indeed as an 'All Inclusive' booking, the hotel does only provides traditional international booze/drinks, and as much as you want/can drink.

Overall the hotel clean & modern and the staff were friendly and helpful. The buffet was varied every day and the food was tasty. The Italian al a carte restaurant doesn’t open until summer which we were not told about and the other restaurant only had a small set menu which was disappointing and the choice of 4 restaurants was the reason we chose this hotel. The hotel has direct access to the promenade and beach which is really convenient.

Beautiful decor, spotlessly clean, very friendly staff in all areas from the maids to the staff around the pool to the restaurant staff. The food is kind of what you expect from all inclusive, but plenty of variety, always hot and never seemed to run out even at peak times. Facilities are great, nice gym, spa, indoor pool and the outside pool area is spectacular, quality wooden sunbeds with thick comfy mattresses, enjoyed many a nap during the day.

The entertainments team did a sterling job particularly during the days that is rained and stand out star is YoYo who was funny and did a great job with the bingo and boules.

The waiters were brilliant and my glass was never empty. The reception staff, bar staff and maids were all brilliant. This hotel has WIFI everywhere. The safe is free. One of the main things I would like to mention is that the bedding could be cleaner and as mentioned in some of the reviews below as soon as you have stepped out of the hotel your being harassed on the way to the beach by people trying to sell you things.

More about that in a moment. The hotel is lovely, right on the beach, with gorgeous grounds and seating areas. Loads of beds around the pool area. Food was lovely and I love a strong coffee, and was always well looked after. We were greeted with kisses and hugs at meal times but the staff in the restaurants who do an amazing job. We’ve never been so well looked after and for me this hotel is rated so highly by so many people, due to its fantastic staff and is fully deserving of its People’s choice award.

Again at the bars service was excellent serving branded drinks. There is also a waiter service for drinks, again giving great service. The week we were there the weather was mixed but 100 times better than the UK snow drifts.

There were some standard items at every day; pizza, chips, salads and pasta - but also a different meal theme each evening. There were plenty of sun beds and towels available by the outdoor pools.

On the other hand the staff are ultra helpful while being family and child friendly. Other reviewers suggest that the serving staff pressurize guests for tips, we did not experience this, but as their wage is about €275*, who could blame them. Compared to the neighboring RUI hotels security is less obtrusive, while differing colour wrist bands are required for access to each. The Tikida Palace has Separate gym…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,Best holiday of my life!,"This hotel was absolutely fantastic. Our room was lovely, in immaculate condition and spacious. The hotel grounds were so peaceful and relaxing. The gardens were well maintained. The staff were wonderful, everyone was so pleasant and couldn't do enough to help you. The food was nice and varied. However because we were vegans we were a little limited but we still ate well. We went for my birthday and the housekeeper left a beautiful display of roses for me. They also left gifts for us on christmas eve which I loved. The entertainment team work hard to provide a varied programme which we enjoyed. On the negative side, I guess the only thing I can say is that the chefs don't speak much english to ask about the content of the food but the restaurant manager is really helpful so…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,4,Nice hotel,"This is a good hotel with beautiful gardens/foliage and pool. It’s right on the sea front. The staff were the highlight friendly, attentive and accommodating. Our room was decent but the bathroom didn’t have a lock which was awkward because I travelled with friends and not family! The food was quite varied but was of average quality I would have expected better of a 5 star resort. I recommend this hotel for location, staff and the beautiful grounds.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2018,5,Perfectly relaxing,"We spent a wonderfully relaxing week here straight after new year. The food was great, I highly recommend the omelette station for a healthy breakfast. I enjoyed taste testing the hordeuvers in the evening, lunch in the restaurant overlooking the beach was great too & I developed an unhealthy addiction to the harissa! We indulged in afternoon tea most days, from the same lunch restaurant, where the selection of patisserie was so tempting. Early evening drinks in the hotel lobby bar was a highlight, working our way through the cocktail menu, beers or the rose wine which were always accompanied with olives & nuts to tied us over until a late dinner. The room was so lovely & spacious, the lower level lounge area giving the whole space a nice touch. The pool area was great,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2018,5,Fabulous,"We went to celebrate my birthday and had a fabulous time. The hotel is lovely and staff amazing! It was our first time here and we will probably return at some point. Slight disappointment with the animation here .. we stayed last year in Cape Verde and were expecting some fun around the pool or a beach party but there was nothing. We didn't watch the shows, preferring the low key entertainment in the main bar. Food is fabulous, breakfast and dinner served in main buffet restaurant, lunch in a lovely restaurant by the beach. Try the speciality restaurant especially Kystal which was a lovely experience. I received red roses, chocolate, a basket of fruit and a lovely pottery trinket box left in my room for my birthday, and a note in an envelope to hand to the restaurant that…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Perfect Palace,"After a bad start to the holiday thanks to TUI (will never use this company again, never even saw them one in our whole stay). From stepping through the door to leaving the holiday was perfect. Excellent hotel credit to all the staff and I mean all the staff. The hotel is spotless, well maintained, staff are attentive and friendly. Tips are very much appreciated and I feel a better service given, but without tipping each and everyone the service we received was good. One only criticism was sitting on my own in the dining room I had to ask for coffee at breakfast as no one appeared to acknowledge, but each table around was served instantly, this happened twice. When sat as a couple no problem receiving it, so not sure what was going on there. The rooms are lovely, everything you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Good Quality Hotel,"We booked a quick get away in the Sun and found this deal for a all inclusive 5 star hotel. We have been to Morocco before to a few places over the years but never Agadir. The Hotel was incredible value for money and the food quality of food was excellent, the Staff could not do enough for you and the rooms was very nice indeed. The sun bathing area/ pool/gardens were very good and well kept, gated and leading to the beach, with a nice promenade to walk along. Some good trips if you want to go on them, we usually do go exploring, but didn't this time as just came to relax. All in all a very good relaxing week away and excellent value for money, with an interesting mix of people and cultures from many different countries, very nice atmosphere indeed. So if you want a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Awesome,"Start with the opulent feel to this truly wonderful 5star hotel. You walk in and all the staff greet you with a smile and the reception staff were also very helpful. Our room number 4094 overlooked the landscaped areas with water features that approach the pools and pool bars. The room was well appointed and everything had a classy feel to it. The food was excellent and waiter interaction was good without being overbearing. My only criticism here would be that some, not all, will reach across in front of your face to retrieve a plate. The wine is palatable with your meal both the rosè and the red and on every occasion a new bottle was opened. I did wonder what happens to left overs. All inclusive does mean all inclusive here and international brands can be found and served 24 /…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Great Hotel - WARNING - DO NOT GET HENNA TATTOOS outside on the beach !!!,"Great Week - completely spolied by Beach Vendors (nothing to do with Riu) Brilliant week - Great Food,service, People - especially Yousef who taught us some Arabic -Rooms were clean, plenty of room - the lack of bunfight for sunbeds a real bonus and generally a really unexpectedly good holiday - We had Henna tattoos on our last day and ended up in A&E with severe Chemical burns both me and my 14 year old daughter and are frankly livid about it - NOT the fault of RIU but there should be at least some kind of warning in place inside the hotel or from TUI",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,EXCELLENT!!!,"The only complaint is the very poor service at the airport but that is nothing to do with the Hotel, be prepared to wait for 1 hour+ to get through passport control! Another tip if you buy tobacco at the duty free at Gatwick don't bother as you will pay twice for the same tobacco i.e Golden V. 10 packs at 50 gms Duty free £96 , TUI plane £46. Now back to the Hotel what can I say bad about it.........NOTHING! Rooms are very spacious, every toiletry you need is there, fridge with cold drinks and water is supply everyday also there are tea and coffee facilities in the room.Big TV where you can watch English, French, Spanish etc etc. There are 3 swimming pools , a gymnasium all very well equipped.

It’s the best all inclusive resort we have been to, lovely gardens, private beach, right on the sea front. Perfect for relaxing and being pampered. Huge selection of food to choose from, wine by the bottle at lunch and dinner time and branded spirits and soft drinks. Would highly recommend for couples or families.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The location is perfect being in the centre of the promenade, lovely walks left or right. One minute to the gorgeous 7 km promenade and beach with private area, via manned gates. The hotel itself is amazing, grand reception, bar and entertainment lounge. Our room was so spacious, modern, spotless with huge comfy bed, living area, walk in wardrobe area, safe, fridge, hairdryer, double marble basins, bidet, toilet, shower bath, totaly luxury. Fridge filled up every other day. Staff are amazing, Loubna makes the best coffee in the world, Hamin, Yassin, Wael, all happy friendly helpful waiters.

 February 2018,5,Feb Half term with Kids,"We decided on a Holiday to Agadir, as the hotel looked wonderful and the reviews very good. On arriving in Morocco the passport control to getting to the hotel took 2hours! I had read that the passport control was slow and we weren't wrong. I would advise getting a private taxi as the wait for all the families/couples to come through and get on the coach was painful... On arriving at the hotel, we were met with very smiley staff and a welcome drink, a speedy check in and all the cases taken to your room was a lovely touch. Our room was large and spacious, plenty of wardrobe space - I do not travel light! Clean towels every day and the tv not bad too. The safe is free to use, no deposit needed. The tea, coffee water was replenished in the room and they were never shy on handing…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,5,Amazing stay,"Clean and luxurious rooms. Lots of space, double sink, large bed, living area and balcony. Excellent service at bars and restaurants. Sometimes a lack of sunbeds by the pool and fresh towels ran out at the end of the day. Will definitely stay at other RUI hotels in the future.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,last minute break,"We have just returned from a week stay at the Riu Palace. On the whole we were very happy with our stay. Our room was clean and a nice size. We had a small patio outside near the pool which didn't get any sun. Personally I felt the bathroom needed updating and a shower would have been much preferable. The room was very dark even when the lights were on and felt claustrophobic. We thought that on the whole all the rooms and corridors were very, very dark. It probably feels different when it's warmer. We have no complaints about the food, although yes it can be tepid at times. We ate at the Fusion restaurant twice and were more than happy with the food and service, however there is no atmosphere. We also ate at the Moroccan restaurant and were disappointed. I have had…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Fantastic Hotel,"We visited the Tikida Palace hotel 12/2/18 - 19/2/18 with Tui from Manchester and had an adsolutely amazing time at this truly beautiful resort. I cannot recommend this hotel and the resort of Agadir more highly and here is why: Firstly the resort of Agadir, Morocco is only 3.5 hours flying time from the UK, which is a huge bonus. Secondly the Moroccan people are lovely and finally the weather is perfect this time of year with average temps of 23 degrees, great for a winter break. The hotel itself is quite compact compared to some I have visited but its very well presented and the attention to detail and service provided by the staff is outstanding. I cant ever remember seeing so many staff on a staff/guest ratio but they all worked tirelessly to provide myself, my wife and all…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,A great escape,"Fantastic. Tired of the cold damp weather in the UK in Winter, Agadir seemed to hit the spot. If you are looking for a complete veg out in a great well equipped hotel, this is the place. It offers all inclusive board for which we were not disappointed. The food in the main restaurant (Breakfast and Evening) covered all tastes and was cooked to a high standard. Of course it would be rude not to wash it down with some quite pleasant local wines, for which the supply seemed to be endless. Your stay also includes one night in each of the themed restaurants (bookable) which added a more intimate ambiance and once again with excellent set menu food. One thing also not forgetting are the staff. They make the place! Cheery greetings and smiles welcome you wherever you go, being…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Great Winter Break,Decided at the last minute to have a one week break. As we have been here before we new what to expect. Good food and plenty of it. All drinks and cocktails were plentiful. The weather was 70-75 for about 6 hours a day. Our ground floor room had a garden overlooking the beautiful pool and bar. The hotel entertainment was quite good but the evening music in the bar was abysmal. And I mean abysmal. And yes we will return because it really is a good chillout.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2017,4,Beautiful,Was a beautiful hotel weather was lovely possibly rained a little on one of the days but would dry up very quick is more of lazy break not a lot to see. I just don’t recommended tuis massage place that they recommended it was in no way quiet and very dirty and just couldn’t enjoy it and relax because there was so much happening there and the women didn’t stop talking outside you can hear everything as there’s no doors in the room and was no electricity! your better paying more for the one in the hotel.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Lovely relaxing break,"Would recommend this hotel for a very relaxing break, lovely rooms and attentive staff, buffet food excellent - not impressed with the a la carte. Bar staff were excellent particularly Faisal, Issam, Mohamed and Neesham they always had our favourite drinks ready and always found us bar stools when the bar was busy.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,4,Enjoyable stay but some issues mean not 5 star,"My comments need to be read in the context of the time of our stay - first 2 weeks in February 2018 - and may not reflect what the hotel is like at other times of the year, although some things will be consistent. Nothing to do with the hotel directly, but my wife and I knew it would be chilly in the evenings, so brought some ""warm"" clothing, e.g. I had a couple of long-sleeved shirts and my wife had a couple of cardigans, but there were 4 days of overcast conditions with a cold wind, making being outside impossible, with the evenings being particularly cold - although most evenings proved chilly in the hotel - evidenced by the predominantly French guests with their scarves and puffa jackets, even in the restaurant and lobby bar!! So come prepared if travelling at this time of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,2,A very disappointing holiday; definitely not a five-star hotel!,"We were desperate for some late Winter sun and five star luxury to relax after a terrible year. I really wish we had moved hotels as this was quite possibly the biggest waste of well earned money and time off from work. This is a long review but I hope this gives a clear insight into our bad experience, not only for the hotel itself, but for prospective guests, as I wouldn't want them to have the same experience as us. I also hope that the hotel make some changes and give some training to their staff to be able to provide a better experience for their guests. Walking in from the sun on our first day, I was immediately taken aback by the vast, dark space of the lobby. Some might say ‘grand’ with its dark woods, high ceilings and array of sofas and armchairs. It took a while for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Reception area very large good impression when first arrived and check in very fast as long as you filled in the reservation form given at the airport before arriving. Your luggage was delivered to your room more or less straight away. We arrived quite late 9:30 ish so went directly to the dining room for food. First impressions very big could sit a lot of people. Waiters very professional, friendly and quick to get us seated and drinks waiting on our table when returning with food.

Great staff in the restaurant, welcoming and professional assistant manager Carlos and entertaining and helpful poolside staff. Food and wine is plentiful and delicious.

Room service, mini fridge with refreshments! We received a little gift, as a welcome as when we booked we had mentioned we had been together 14 years and this was kind of our celebration! I couldn’t recommend this hotel enough, We felt truly pampered throughout our whole stay! Thank You Tikida Palace we will definitely be returning and bringing the family too 😊",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,4,Lovely holiday,Hotel was beautiful and staff so friendly and polite. Hotel was very clean and swimming pool area luxurious.

 January 2018,5,Fabulous choice for a winter break.,We returned from a week staying at this hotel on 5th feb nicely rested and a nice suntan to go with it. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are so friendly always smiling and saying hello or asking if you were okay. Our room was one of the biggest we have stayed in although the beds are a touch too hard. For the first two days i had to turn the air con off and put the heating on . Of course going at this time of year there is a nip in the air sometimes so do not expect to be lying in the sun until around ten thirty and it cools around four thirty again. The food was very good it could of been a bit hotter at times but there is plenty of choice.

 August 2017,5,Fantastic hotel set directly on the beach,"We had the most fantastic holiday here in August. 12 days with family & friends. The food was fantastic, particularly for an all-inclusive.

You won’t regret booking here.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,4,Exceptional value for money,"It was fascinating reading the reviews of this hotel before our trip there on 29 January for 10 days. Having now experienced it for ourselves, generally I'm in agreement with most other reviewers. Worth saying at the start though that this was not our usual type of holiday - first time in North Africa and we usually go to Lanzaeote at this time of the year, in a self-catering villa. Staff - pretty much faultless. Reception were impeccable: on the first day, I realised I'd left my iPhone charger at home and asked at Reception if they could lend me one until I could go out and buy one from somewhere.

The restaurant staff were nice, nothing was too much trouble for them. The Food in the restaurant was very varied, we tried lots of unusual dishes and I shall now be trying the recipes at home. The room maid was very efficient too. The grounds are well kept and it was nice to have a slightly warm pool. This was our first time in Morocco and we did enjoy it.

 February 2018,5,Fabulous hotel,"Just got back after a week at Palace Tikida and couldn’t fault the experience. From the welcome drinks when we arrived we were made to feel extremely welcome and the staff were very friendly. The hotel was kept immaculately clean and the food was fantastic. As it was low season only 2 of the a la carte restaurants were open and we would definitely recommend Krystal, the food was lovely. Sparkling wine was included in the all inclusive as were some branded spirits which was great. There was a cocktail menu but the staff were more than happy to make anything you wanted. I’d definitely go back and stay there again!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,3,"Great hotel, shame about some of the the staff","A beautiful hotel in an amazing location. We had a wonderful view of the promenade from our room, so watching the locals going about their business was great. The food was nice with plenty to offer even the fussiest eaters, especially the speciality restaurants. The only problem with the hotel were some of the staff. For example, in the lunch buffet area, the waitress told us to move to another table as she had clearly been paid by the Moroccan family who wanted to take over a whole area. At the pool, you were invisible to some of the waiters unless you lined their palms in advance. We spent a whole day being ignored whilst the couple next to us had a regular supply of drinks the whole day. It is a shame the waiters were so desperate to please those willing to pay in advance,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The weather was hot and sunny during the day but cold enough at night to need heating on in the hotel some evenings. Our room was spacious and comfortable at the back of the hotel, so quiet apart from occasionally hearing people returning very late at night. There was a fridge, free use of the safe and tea/coffee making facilities, though replenishing stocks was rather hit - and - miss! Despite the size of the room there were no storage facilities other than a wardrobe. A chest of drawers and a bedside cabinet with a drawer would have been welcome. The bathroom was huge and well equipped - apart from nowhere to put soap/ shower gel/shampoo etc in the shower - except on the floor! The choice of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Amazing hotel,"Never having visited Morocco before I wasn't sure what to expect but I was not disappointed.

The professional yet friendly manner of the staff, the relaxed feeling, the stylish yet comfortable furnishings and the fabulous food. Check in/reception - this was simple with the polite manner of the pleasant reception staff. Sofienne checked us in and he was most helpful in relocating my friend and I to a room that had twin beds as there had been a mix up in the allocations and we first were offered a room with a superking - not quite right for us as two female friends holidaying. our request was dealt with swiftly and at all times with a smile.

Negatives: dark & tired rooms with poor lighting (Moroccan theme?), uncomfortable beds and lumpy pillows, 'samey' food and lukewarm, hit and miss customer service - tended to favour other nationalities & those tipping throughout (we prefer to tip at the end), age range tended to be 65+ upwards, cocktails of poor quality and ready made mixers, arrangement of tables in buffet reminded us of school dinners and very noisy, some staff work very hard others appear to be doing very little - management issue.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

You‘re definitely not getting bored with the wide offer the hotel provides, as we appointed for one of the relaxing massages at the Spa with wonderful smelling oils, also we enjoyed both of the A-la-carte restaurants.

The reason we keep going back is the wonderful staff who make you so welcome and nothing is too much trouble for them. Great selection of food as usual and again well presented. The Crystal restaurant is well worth a visit where it's nice to be waited on and a change from the buffet main restaurant. The hotel has now been opened for over 6 years and there are now slight signs of wear and tear, mainly around the swimming pool area where some of the floor tiles need replacing, nevertheless, this would not put us off returning again and we are looking forward to going again later in the year.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The staff are great, friendly and helpful (there was a grumpy one on the lounge bar - but he was the only one). Terek in the main restaurant was really great, made sure everyone was where they wanted to be. He handled the occasional arrogant customers very well and professionally and was always friendly and cheerful - he was a pleasure to be around. The Xmas eve and NY Eve dinners were fabulous.

I would definitely consider going abroad again over Christmas.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We were advised that we had been given a 'very nice room' Well what a shock, we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite, it was huge. !! Once we had unpacked we went to dinner, Loads of choice, very friendly staff. Sadly the weather was not the usual temperatures that you get in January and during the week we even had rain. This did not put a dampener on the holiday though. We had an excursion to Essaouira, well worth the 3 hour taxi ride through the mountains.

 January 2018,5,5🌟,"Absolutely loved our holiday here in January and wish we could have stayed longer. Excellent food, breakfast and dinner is served at the main restaurant while lunch is served at the restaurant beside the pool. Although we only ate breakfast and dinner. Pool is amazing, there is 2 outdoors, 1 is heated, with a small jacuzzi. The indoor pool was heated and peaceful. Only thing I would say is that there are no stairs to walk into the pool, you have to climb down a ladder type stair to get in and out. Sunbeds are a plenty, good strong wooden ones and not cheap plastic. Poolbar was open even in January! Staff are lovely, everyone we met said hello, pretty good English thank goodness as our Arabic and French are non existent. Rooms are so spacious, there's a big bed, a living area,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2018,5,Excellent Hotel and Resort,"We are just back from a very pleasant week in the Riu Palace tikida in Agadir.

 October 2017,5,Riu Tikida Palace,"Oh my - the only place I've stayed where we have had smoked salmon with scrambled egg and prosecco for breakfast at an all inclusive hotel. This hotel is just superb. The pool is clean and the little covered double sunbeds are just great especially if you have children you want to keep out of the sun. The marina and big souk are within walking distance, and there is a smaller souk just up the beach. You can choose to eat outside, although this fills up very quickly. My only gripe is that smoking is permitted in the outside dining area, and even as a smoker myself, I don't want to smell smoke whilst I am eating. Loved this hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2018,5,Back to it’s best,Just returned from a week here and we fell back in love. Last year after 6 visits we felt standards had dropped but it’s back on form so much so we have booked to go again in November Food is great and drink plentiful staff are amazing just 2 grumbles: there is no recognition of returners from the hotel There was no storage in our room for our clothes just 5 ha gets and no shelves or drawers,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The main restaurant Buffett was good but felt the tables all very close together as a couple we like a table for 2. Was a great variety of food. But it was cold, plates all cold as well, the staff make a great fuss over the French guests all kisses and hugs not what I want from waiting staff they didn’t seem to like British guests though we were the only ones there from NIreland.

 January 2018,5,What a fabulous hotel,Visited the Riu tikida palace with my family recently and cannot praise it highly enough. The food was beautiful both in the evening and lunch buffet restaurants and in the fusion al a cart restaurant. The staff could not have been more pleasant and friendly and when my mum fell ill they could not have been more helpful. The room was beautiful and the shower was amazing. The only negative thing I can say is that the mattress was unnecessarily hard. Other than that cannot recommend enough!!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2018,5,Excellent Week,"I just came back from a week at Riu Tikida and would like to comment that the food service is really outstanding. Many options and different restaurants to choose from in the all inclusive package. Youssef is the nicest waiter I have ever seen. by the third day he already knew my preferences of drinks before I even ordered. I was impressed given the size of the restaurant and the amount of people he served every day. I was also please with Lubna at the entrance lobby. She was very kind and tried her best to acommodate our needs, always smiling. The pool area was gorgeous. I think the hotel should think about having at least the bubble pool and 1 pool outside warmer, for example at 37C. I think it would attract many more people, since the weather can be cold in Jan and Feb. We…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The large reception and bar area has a dim lighting ,not to my tastes.. Grounds wow At this time of year not a great issue but it will be in the peak seasons. We went walking every morning and retuned at lunch time to find sunbeds ,no issues . But we did observe the towel on bed brigade putting towels on at daft o'clock and sitting on them after lunch.

 August 2017,4,Nice holiday,Had a nice relaxing holiday with family. The all inclusive was amazing having a beer on tap for whole holiday was definitely a positive for me. The hotel was nice and clean and the cleaners do an amazing job keeping the rooms clean every day the only down fall is staff moving furniture in the mornings but I only heard this twice. The pool is lovely and the activities during the day are good as well this is mostly down to the staff being so friendly and helpful especially yoyo he made our stay so enjoyable he's a massive credit to the hotel.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2018,5,Excellent Hotel,Currently finishing our week break at the Palace. We've booked through Tui. For the money this is without the best hotel we have stayed in. The all inclusive offer is without doubt very good quality - the best me and my wife have experienced. The quality of the surroundings is better than any resort hotel we have stayed in. From the room balcony furnishings to the cabanas and sofas around the pool the place is not the run of the mill hotel. The food is excellent and varied. Special mention from us to Said who works the lunchtime and evening buffet restaurants. He could not do enough for us and our 1 year old daughter. His hospitality made our holiday. He is a credit to the Palace.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2018,5,A Perfect Holiday,Just got home from a week at the Riu Tikida Palace and I must say it was an amazing week. The whole experience was first class from the moment we arrived to our last evening their. The room we had was very spacious and had a lovely view over the pool area which was fantastic. The mini bar was stocked daily with an array of soft drinks and water which was a great touch. The Hotel itself is decorated amazingly and definitely adding modern touches but not so much to lose its charm. The best asset to the hotel is the service it provides. My Girlfriend and I travelled here to celebrate my 30th Birthday and everything was done by the staff here to ensure it was a memorable one. On the day of my Birthday we booked Into the Krystal restaurant and were greeted by a decorated table…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The rooms are very large & offer a seating area & large balcony & Dressing area & separate sinks. Amazing shower so powerful & consistent temperature. Loads of bar seating areas to choose from & great atmosphere in the evening. You can have a laugh with the bar staff.Loads of sun loungers. Obviasly there’s a lot of people that put there towels out early like anywhere. Heated pool is nice. The food is probably the best we’ve had at an all inclusive. So much variety & changed daily for new options. The cakes & biscuits are divine! If you can’t find something to eat here you can’t anywhere.

 January 2018,5,Wonderful! Highly recommended!,"I visited this hotel with a couple of girlfriends for a short break to celebrate a birthday. One of our party had been several times before to this hotel and gave it glowing reports. Her description was exactly right, we had a fantastic time. It's great to see such a hands on approach from the managers, the manager Nader and his assistant manager Carlos, were always at the key touch points throughout the day, leading from the front, consequently, all staff were very attentive. The food was absolutely delicious, so much choice, always something different to tempt you. The public areas were magnificent and spotlessly clean as was our room.

The rooms are great, the food spectacular both in choice and quality, the all inclusive drinks are top quality and the staff are outstanding. We even took Arabic lessons with the excellent Yo-yo.

Better to stay in hotel ,which is great value for money",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

There is a very warm welcoming atmosphere throughout and you will be very well looked after!

 December 2017,5,Winter holiday,"Arrived at the hotel first week in December for a week's holiday. Food was good, there was always a good selection to suit varying tastes.

Excellent beach and promenade stretching for about 3 miles, would definitely return.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2017,4,Lovely and clean,"We throughly enjoyed our family holiday here. The rooms are clean and roomy, the buffet meals are varied and delicious. The a la carte restaurants are nice but the menus in these restaurants do not cater for children. The whole complex is clean and the staff are amazing and very friendly. The only bug bear that we had was the reserving of sunbeds by guests!!! Most days we would be by the pool by 9am and not a single bed by the pool was available as guests put towels over them to reserve and in a lot of cases didn't turn up to their beds until lunchtime. Very annoying! Other than this everything else was spot on. We will definately be back as a family to this resort.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,"3rd visit, looking forward to returning","Went for 4 night break over New Year. This was our 1st time for New Year. Yet again we were not disappointed. From arriving to leaving ( I did not want to go home) we were looked after. Every member of staff are a credit to Riu. The New Year Gala Dinner was fantastic. The rooms are tastefully decorated, the food was fantastic as were the drinks. Prosecco any time of the day. The weather was hot enough to sunbathe, a bit windy at times, bearable tho. Did not go to specialty restaurants as only there for 4 nights and have been before. We were looked after by everyone, a little tip to thank them no matter how small is very much appreciated. We have made good friends with management and staff and cannot wait to return. Thank you Riu",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2017,4,Loved it,Can't fault this hotel. We loved everything. Food waa great. People where great. Staff gave so much attention to my hyperactive toddler. Loved it. Would definitely return.

I did ask for a top floor room in a quiet area..what i got was a second floor room next to the stairs....so off to a bad start there.....the girl at reception made out as though she was doing us a favor by upgrading us to a pool view...erm hello i have spent tens of thousands of pounds with this chain and my loyalty card t&c state that if and upgrade is available then i can have it...dont just say...you booked economy..who in their right mind would pay for an extra they are due to anyway On the first day the service was so bad we complained to the manager....staff filling half emtpy wine bottles into other…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,Riu does it again,"You can always count on Riu to pick the best locations for their hotels and once again this didn't dissapoint. Ideally located close to beach, a stroll to left brought you to the other Riu hotels and plage Bleu, restaurant, and to the right about 30 minutes slow stroll brought you to the Marina, passing by shops, restaurants and the big wheel. Being a regular to Morocco, (Marrakech) , Agadir lived up to the same standards of lovely people and brilliant friendly staff. The hotel is highly recommended, beautiful grounds, rooms and surroundings, good food and drink and most of all lovely staff. A visit to the Krystal restaurant is recommended. In all a lovely holiday we would be happy to repeat.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,Christmas break,"What a lovely hotel. Everyone helped to make Christmas a relaxed time. Where do I start...it really lived up to being called Palace.

 January 2018,4,Great place to relax in the sunshine,"We do like a January holiday as the sunshine is pretty much guaranteed and we did have this. Having been to Agadir 4 years ago at another Riu hotel, we saw this hotel whilst having a walk along the beach front. Being all inclusive you would think there would be certain drinks off limits but ordering Prosecco most nights and our friends Baileys, that's not the case. The flight there was around 3 hours then a coach transfer which took around 45 minutes. Check in was very efficient and smooth. We had booked a suite and it was HUGE. The only downside was the mattress was on the hard side. More than enough wardrobe space and space in general. The whole hotel feels very spacious which is nice as there was always free sun loungers and seats in the restaurant and bar area. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

This time was for a short break with two friends to celebrate a big birthday. They had never been to Agadir before and were so impressed... are now looking to go with their husbands. I truly believe you lead from the top: The management of this hotel is second to none. They are visible... and always walking around, checking on things and talking to staff and guests. Hence all staff, whatever their role, adopt the same standard..and are superb. (Too many names to mention). The hotel is spotless. All public areas are super. The grounds are beautiful.

There aren't too many places where you can get guaranteed sun that don't require travelling a long distance.. you have the Canaries in particular Tenerife.. Lanzarote is way too windy this time of year! We've done Tenerife and Lanzarote and they have their purposes but they are very same food is always a big blah and they try to make everything English.. ie offer everything battered.

If you are European, just be carefull with some potential gastroenteritis from the water (ice from the drinks, and coffee) and salads. We have absolutely no complains about the quality of the restaurant and food, but their water is just different... To improve: we stayed a long time (30m) at the reception at the check-in because they didn't have our room available. The best: the team from the pool is the Soul of the Hotel!

 January 2018,4,A nice holiday for lazing,"We came here with two other couples wanting some relaxation. We saw this hotel whilst walking along the seafront three years ago and liked the look of it. Travelled with Tui and the flight was short and uneventful. If you like to watch a movie download one as the plane has no entertainment. Transfer was fine though the security clearance was a little slow and there was a wait for the stragglers to get on the coach. The journey takes around 45 mins. Beware it does take you through some pretty poor areas but don’t let it worry you. Check in was very friendly and quick and you were given the customary “cocktail”. As it’s all inclusive you need a band. Cases were taken to the room, you are expected to tip. We had no Moroccan money but were told he’d take English which we didn’t…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Upon arrival me and my partner were greeted with fruit cocktails, which was fantastic, but due to my allergy to pineapple I was unable to drink it. This was no issue for the staff as they immediately ran to the bar and to my surprise, came back to me with another cocktail which I was able to drink (baring in mind I didn’t even ask for them to make me another one!)

 January 2018,5,Very well deserved 'Certificate of Excellence',"I've always wondered what it takes in practice for a hotel to be conferred a TripAdvisor 'Travellers' Choice® Winner' and after my latest (and 4th) visit to the Riu Palace Tikida in Agadir, I have absolute clarity. From our check in experience, room, to food, service experience, and in fact every aspect of our stay, this hotel not only manages to maintain its outstanding standards, it somehow manages to improve them each time we visit. One major factor makes the biggest difference - the staff. From the general manager to the room cleaner, every single member of the team makes us feel like we are dearly loved long lost relatives returning home after a long time away.

 December 2017,5,Lovely holiday,"We spent Christmas and New Year here and had a wonderful time. As this seems to be the quieter time of year we had no problem getting a seat for any of the meals though I imagine during busier times this could be an issue. As would be finding a place round the pool. We found the majority of the staff friendly and helpful though round the pool bar it was less attentive. The lobby bar staff couldn't be better even seeing an empty glass from behind the bar and next thing you know there is a replacement. Unfortunately as we were both full of cold, we didn't make it to midnight on NYE but what we did experience was lovely. The food and entertainment was well done. We did venture out of the hotel and the beach front is lovely to stroll along as it is flat and wide. The constant hassle…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,What a Wonderful Surprise !!!!!!,We travelled here on Christmas day for one week and it was our first visit to Morocco. Well after a few days we felt like we had been many times as the staff spoilt us and the staff are a real credit to this hotel !!! They cannot do enough for you and always with a smile and take time to get to know you even though they are very busy. In the evening's we sat on the terrace to eat our dinner and the whole team are the best we have encountered. We always give tips and every person deserves a tip but we allow 100 pounds per holiday so can't stretch that far.

 January 2018,5,Almost faultless,"Most enjoyable and relaxed week spent enjoying sun and sand. Staff very friendly and obliging. At first we found the bed a little hard for our liking but as soon as we mentioned it they arranged softer toppers. The food was generally good standard with no end of wine and other beverages including champagne. Rooms were spacious and clean. There were some good offers on the spa if you looked for them, but the spa area was a little lacking in elegance, ie the hamman steam room had flaking paint and some mound. Our only real problem, not the hotels fault, noisy residents! The rooms are not sound insulted and noise carried down the corridor and from other rooms. Many guests shouted, whistled and generally made noise well into the small hours! Nevertheless we plan to return. Thanks…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2018,5,Third time,"This is our third visit and once again it has lived up to expectations. The only thing missing this year was a lack of waiting staff around the pool area. Most staff are excellent, we came across only one grumpy member of staff on reception I asked him for change one evening and he acted as though I had made an improper proposal. The food was excellent and once again we didn’t bother with the specialty restaurants as the buffet is so good. The weather was about 22-25 degrees.

 August 2017,5,Great hotel,"This is one of the best Riu hotels we have stayed at. Large well designed, the room we had was more like a suit. Best tip don't stay around the over busy swimming pool but get out and meet the locals who are very friendly. The pool attendants are very accommodating, the young family of 4 next to us had 10 fresh towels laid out for them every day before they arrived at the pool. This is not part of the all inclusive package. So when you are queuing in the hot sun and there are no towels you will soon find out why.

 December 2017,4,christmas in Morocco,"This was our second visit to this hotel, we were welcomed with a cool non alcoholic cocktail, check in was quick and our room ready for us. We went for lunch first and immediately felt like we had never left, everything was exactly as we remembered. Our room although not facing the pool area had a sea view and was sunny all day. The food was varied something for everyone and the service excellent , the bar staff were also excellent and remembered your chosen tipple no matter how busy they were. The only issues were the cold tap ....no water! took 3 days to fix which I believe was due to the staff on reception not understanding what the issue was, and then after waiting for the technician to visit we returned to a flooded bathroom later in the day. The housekeeping lady was quick…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,A nice relaxing Christmas and New Year stay!,"Just returned after a eleven day stay over Christmas and New Year. It is our second stay at this hotel and we both love it. We were also lucky with the weather, low to mid twenties around noon, cooler before and after. We stayed in a standard north facing room on the third floor. It was more than adequate and spotlessly clean. Although the main restaurant is a buffet, the food was 'out of this world', with food choices for all tastes. The Gala Dinners on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve were exceptional. We also had a Hamman and a Argon Oil Massage at the hotel Spa, highly recommended. Once again the staff are the Palaces main asset.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,Amazing hotel,"This is the six time I have visited Agadir but decided to up the game and try a different riu hotel having previously staying the others numerous times. I was not disappointed! This hotel is completely different to the Club Riu Tikida Dunas and Riu Tikida Beach. It was impossible to find faults with this hotel, the management were very hands on and you could see them around the hotel all times of day. The staff and animation team are a credit hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean complete with mini. The food and drink was fantastic and the chefs were very creative creating various sculptures for the Xmas gala. I definitely shall return.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2018,5,Xmas break,Check hotel friendly staff. Everything you would expect from a 5* resort. I would happily rebook if returning to Agadir. It was a quieter time of year so it was very quiet. There are some large construction sites nearby which spoilt the view on entry but this didn’t effect our stay. The food in the hotel was expensive in comparison to local Restaurants. The breakfast was good fresh orange juice and mint tea was great. The spa was hit and miss the treatments were ok but some of the equipment needs attention the Jacuzzi was Luke warm and when we asked she said it was supposed to be like that! The sauna was nice but had a gap in the door which let all the heat escape. Other than that the finish was nice and staff professional. They also offer some good deals on treatments at…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2017,5,Another wonderful visit,"This was my second visit to the Palace and my husband’s first. My first time was twelve months ago with my daughter on a last minute booking based purely on Tripadvisor reviews. Neither of us had been to Morocco before but she loves the Palace so much she has since returned three times on her own with a further two visits for 2018 already booked! She said that although she goes on her own she never feels like she is on her own which is purely due to the fact that the wonderful staff all look after her so well and make her feel like she is at home. We had a fantastic week at the beginning of December. The staff at this hotel are its biggest asset. Nothing is too much trouble. They are all so polite, friendly and courteous. Food is very good, my husband is a VERY fussy eater and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I gave my thanks and appreciation to Alberto for listening and acting on his guests requests..please don't hesitate to ask..is Alberto and Carlos's motto! The Hotel as a whole will go out of their way to accommodate all guests and any wishes, complaints, or requests that are put forward..as they say if we don't know..we can't help. Which is very true. I won't go into detail but at least another 5 requests were fully implemented and as soon as they possibly could...which makes this Hotel..and its staff..one of the BEST.

 December 2017,5,Lovely service and food,"Just returned from a 10 day break at this hotel. The staff are truly fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. Beds are hard but toppers are available. Front desk staff are very knowledgeable and courteous. We liked the food, considering the sheer numbers they cater for it is excellent. Christmas Eve gala was wonderful, the staff get a round of applause from the management and guests and boy do they deserve it. Our room was almost a suite, spacious and comfortable. The only downside was the pool beds, one British couple were getting up at 4.30am to reserve beds, ridiculous! A good mix of nationalities make it feel cosmopolitan. Went to Pure Passion for dinner one night, highly recommended if you need a good steak fix. The entertainment was a little boring, we went to the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2017,5,Winter break at Rui Palace Tikida,"For a week in the sunshine this is ideal for couples and friends ( not a teenager hotel) who want something relaxing. Not so many children, but those that are here are still enjoying themselves...2 Pools outside and 1 inside are clean, plenty of sunbeds to go around even at 10 in the morning. obviously there are some great bed locations but you need to be flighty at 6.30 to get your towel on those if you want them... Food is excellent and you'd think you were in mainland Europe if you didn't know better.. 2 themed restaurants are available if you want those , they are popular so book soon when you arrive..the service in all the restaurants is excellent and attentive.

 May 2017,5,Best holiday ever!,"What can I say negative about this hotel and resort NOTHING! We went in May 2017 and the weather was beautiful very hot 34’c plus. Resort in agadir was great loads to do, water sports and dining. Food was great & halal which was good for us as that’s what we eat. We booked a suite and all I can say is excellent clean spacious and perfect a large balcony with a beautiful sea view. Staff helpful and friendly. Cleaners cleaned your rooms everyday, and fresh towels without asking. This is somewhere I would most defiantly return back too, and I highly recommended this hotel and location and the suite was well worth the extra money to any couples wanting to relax.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,Excellent Hotel,"Just got back from an excellent holiday at this hotel. Can’t find anything to complain about. From the moment we got there to when we left the staff couldn’t do enough for us. Food was excellent and the Christmas Gala was fantastic from the welcome, to the food the entertainment guys, the staff, managers and General hotel manger everybody was involved and went out of their way to make our Christmas Celebrations special. The rooms were lovely, very spacious with seating area, very comfortable bed, safe, provided (free of charge) fridge which was filled everyday with coke, sprit and Fanta.

 April 2017,5,Fantastic Hotel,"Excellent hotel - food and drinks were great. As with most all inclusives, the buffet got a bit repetitive by the end of the week, but there are some nice restaurants a stroll away along the beach if you want to go out. The a la cartes within the hotel were also very nice. More recently went to the Riu Tikida Palmeraie in Marrakech thinking it would be on par with the Tikida Palace in Agadir, but it wasn't. Next time we head to Morocco, we'll definitely return to the Tikida Palace!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,5,Great Holiday,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel set in a lovely setting. The hotel is clean,well kept , helpful staff , good food. The location is good set just yards from the beach or has a great outdoor and for indoor pool in hotel. The weather in Agadir can be overcast till lunchtime then very hot in afternoon, don't be fooled that you won't burn when over cast. The Entertainments guy Called Yoyo is great full of enthusiasm wether it's bingo or organised games by the pool. All in all a very nice relaxing holiday .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2017,1,Going down in standard,"This is my third trip to Riu Palace Agadir and my last. My first trip was very nice and gradually the standard started to drop. This time We booked this hotel for a week because Sofitel was all booked up. And, it was a mistake... Firstly, the airport immigration queue is so long and slow, took us 1 hour 30 minutes to pass immigration. Arrived at the hotel and was greeted with a complementary cocktail and that was a nice welcome. Reception staff were helpful but the rooms offered were too far from the lobby, so changed rooms 4 times and everyone was sick. I think the staff need to understand the guests request and not complicate things. So they were unprofessional at this point. Lovely hotel and location. 5 stars for that. Breakfast, Dinner Lunch is bland and the same…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,The Greatest Hotel in Agadir hands down......,A Truly great hotel our 3rd time now. The hotel is a great huge building but stylish and definitely a 5 star through and through.From the moment you step inside the Tikida Palace you are looked after and nothing is ever a chore here. We never had a bad moment just a dream of a time. We arrived on the 7th of December until the 14th. The weather was about 22 degrees most days with only one day of rain.We had a pool view room 4050 and 4052 our Parents had. The Moroccan feel with its deco smartly presented it ticks all the boxes. There are 3 pools one inside and 2 outside only 1 outside is heated. As is the inside pool too. The food has plenty of options for even the fussiest of people.

Close to the beach swimming pools could be warmer But best improvement wifi in rooms now Keep up the good work and I will be returning. Pomegranate on my last 2 days would be amazing.

Rooms were extremely spacious, well appointed bathrooms, plenty of wardrobe space, dressing area, large bedroom and lounge. Large patio with comfortable chairs. Nice pool, a little cold but it was December. Food nice but a bit repetitive and could have been a bit warmer. Staff very disorganised at times I would have expected better service. Waiter service around the pool was really non existent and similarly in the lounge area you had to go to the bar for your own drinks as waiters only twice during our weeks stay asked if we would like a drink.

 September 2017,5,A great holiday,"Had the junior suite facing the ocean - loved the room and the space I had, you have to get up really early to get your sun loungers and I mean really early I am sure they sleep on them.......

I paid enough for the upgrades without paying extra for a service I should have anyways.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2017,5,Keep this hotel 5 star,Just returned from a week at this hotel This is the 3rd visit to this hotel and again the hotel was lovely The food was good and plenty of choice The staff are amazing and do a brilliant job The drinks was a little disappointing this year as I found that cheaper alternative alcohol was available compared to previous years There was one big criticism the hotel clearly advertises this as a 5 star hotel and so have a policy of men to wear long trousers of a evening We noticed that men was allowed to enter the restaurant and bar area in shorts Please look into this as it would be a shame if standards was to drop If guests want to wear shorts and casual dress of a evening then they should find a 4 star hotel that will accommodate them,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2017,5,100% Disabled Friendly,"Having had such a relaxing holiday when we first visited two years ago we returned in late November for some winter sun. The hotel was just as we remembered it, clean, welcoming and the most amazing staff to look after you. Check in was quick and easy and our bags were taken straight to our room (4031). The room was large, spotless, with sitting room area leading to a decent size balcony containing two chairs and a table overlooking the tennis courts of the hotel next door. The bathroom is huge with his and hers washbasins, a separate room for the toilet and bidet.

The food is so tasty and very varied, every nigh is different. Normally you read spirits are local, not here. All big known brands are available.

We had wonkey wardrobes when we arrived and couldn’t access our draws, I called reception and someone came with tools ready to sort it for us, very polite and efficient. The buffet food was much better quality than I had expected. Everything was fresh and tasty (tiny bit repetitive) and not a frozen chicken nugget in site! Also if you asked for wine you were often left with the bottle which isn’t typical of all inclusives! This was a nice touch and the staff were always on hand to top you up and clear you plates.

After being used to The Riu Palace in Aruba we were disappointed at first, but once we had come to terms with the fact that we were not in the Caribbean we thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel was beautiful, although quite dark due to it’s decoration, and the staff were wonderful. In the main restaurant our waiters were Marouane, Samira and Khadia, when they saw us coming in they made sure there was always a table where we liked to sit and they always remembered what we drank and had our drinks ready.

 November 2017,5,Fourth visit and back to its best!,"We said we would not return in November because of the rowdy French golfers but came a little earlier so managed to only overlap them by a day or two. The Hotel was busy and everything we mentioned in our review last year appears to have been rectified. Someone in management has been busy! The weather was fantastic, the best weather we have ever had in Agadir, wall to wall sunshine. We were given the room we asked for and as mentioned before there was no beer in the fridge but we left a polite note asking for beer and it was filled up every day. We went to Krystals for the first time this time and it was lovely, nice change from the buffet. The reception staff are now a delightful crew, calling out ""Hello"" when not busy and having a chat.

We stayed for 14 nights having flown out from Gatwick when the winter schedule with civilised flight times began operating. After a 2 hour delay for fog we arrived late afternoon at the hotel where the warmth of the weather and welcome on arrival more than compensated for the delay though we were surprised not to be offered a welcome drink. Check in was quick and efficient and we were very impressed in that having emailed the hotel with a room preference a couple of weeks before we arrived our requested room was available.

The location of the room made us felt very depressed. We told the receptionist we were not happy. They changed another room for us. The room was very nice that was near the bar and the restaurant. The room was clean and plenty of room. The manager was nice and helpful that resolved some small problem about the lighting when we mentioned. The hotel is beautiful and the food is very good. The only negative is the Spa. I paid about £40.00 through Thomson Rep for the Haman. I was told I would have steam , scrubbed and wrapped with cling film, then massaged for an hour.

Only problem to report: beware if you book a sea view room - you will get mosquitoes. we have even been bitten on our fingertips and the soles of our feet. I asked at reception earlier if they could help. I was offered the pellets but no diffuser. Was told one would be sent up but never arrived. Had hoped in a hotel of this calibre they may have 'fogged' the plants at dusk like they did in Tunisia especially since I had said we had a problem. Have sprayed the room and covered ourselves in insect repellent but it seems to make no difference.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

There seams to be a class system here, at any time you go upto the main swimming pool bar and food area tables seam to be reserved for special guests.

In particular the head chef Ahmed i am gluten free and every day Ahmed took me round the food and explained what i was able to eat. He was very friendly and approchable and even went out his way to make me my own gluten free desert. The food was brilliant and had a lot of variety.

I usually try to find something to be critical about, but the RIU Palace is faultless. It's the second time we've stayed here; choosing unusually to stay in the same place more once, but the amazing staff from the management to the front line workers made it an easy decision to return. The facilities especially the pool area are immaculate and create a real feeling of being in an oasis.

And the hotel has a brilliant Hill to sit and watch/photograph the most beautiful sunsets! The hotel is grand and impressive if not a little dark at times at night in the huge and open public areas (but great for us as we have a child who doesn’t like bright lights!) The pool is gorgeous with two bars serving it with plenty of areas to sit and sun beds (with parasols) all close to the pool (also plenty of areas not too close to the pool and quieter which is an essential with a child with autism) we could always get a bed around 9am not an issue.

 November 2017,5,RIU Must Stay Here!!!,"Overall 4.5 stars. The good and the bad, in an easy summary...... G: Free Wi-Fi. In the rooms and on the beach and very good signal. This was excellent. We could send e-mails and arrange things from the comfort of the sun lounger. B: Within the hotel grounds there are no lights on the side of each step. But there are two bright lights at the top either side, making things worse because it maks the steps when walking down look like a dark hole. You can't see the number of steps. I made a misstep due to this mid-week and slightly cut my finger on the recovery. G: Free water, cola, sprite, fanta in the room fridge, re-stocked every 2 days. G: There is a good roped off beach area for guests to use sun loungers. We used it often. B: Hotel says towels cannot reserve sun…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Lovely pool/sea view with the lit up mountain just in the background, we spent nearly every night sat on our huge balcony listening to the waves.... perfect !! Service was first class, a little tip (20 dirhams, just less than £2!! Is all that's needed to get a huge warm smile and fantastic service from the staff, although really isn't expected) Pool area was amazing, we always got two beds together round the pool, yes there is the age old problem of towels left and not used till afternoon which is annoying but it's not…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2017,5,Another fabulous week in this amazing hotel.,"This was our 2nd visit with a group of friends and family and once again we were not disappointed. Absolutely everything - service, rooms, staff, food and amenities are first class. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for them. They are a huge asset to this hotel and management have chosen them well. Special mention to Youssef. What an absolute star! We are already looking forward to booking for next November. Thanks to all the staff for making this such an enjoyable experience.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2017,4,Better than last time.,We went with a group of friends we all had a great time as we all did last year. The food was just as good the rooms just as clean the service was better because there were more staff on this year and very friendly to especially yoyo of the animation team. The weather was great i was a bit disappointed as they have stopped the trikes on the promenade we had a great time on them last year i suppose that is a big plus for some people as they could be a bit annoying. We are making plans to go back next year again.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Senior management set a really good example by rolling up their sleeves and helping to clear tables if needs be – Bravo!

We look forward to next year and stay number 5.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

This is a big hotel, very clean, A good choice of food in the restaurant, We chose most of the tme to eat on the terrace, Redouan our head waiter assisted by Ossama and Hamza treated us well.

 November 2017,5,Our 1st trip to Morocco,"We booked this holiday as a last minute break as we usually do long haul but wanted to try somewhere closer to home this year. As soon as we arrived we explored around the hotel and the grounds to see where everything was and it was beautiful! The rooms are spacious and modern with a huge bed! Our room was overlooking a tennis court so we would have preferred overlooking the pool but this cost slightly more and we was unaware when we booked - next time though :) We are always a little sceptical on breakfast when abroad but the breakfast didn’t disappoint, poached eggs were to die for!

The All inclusive is of really high quality, plenty of choice even for the most boring palate. Our room was large with a living room area, dressing room bathroom with bath and his and her basins and separate loo. Each room has a minibar that is refilled daily and more if requested. The pool area is clean and well maintained with 2 large pools, one heated, one with a swim up bar. There is also a Jacuzzi.

To conclude, this hotel is absolutely worth spending the holidays in it.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2017,5,Amazing family holiday,"We have just returned home from 10 nights at the Riu Tikida Place Agadir and could not fault the hotel. It was perfect for us, especially our 2.5yr old son. If you want a relaxing week in the sun, this is the perfect place to go. Definitely try the Krystal restaurant the food is excellent. The staff around the hotel are very helpful and always made a fuss over our son. A special thanks to Said who works in the lunchtime restaurant and Krystal. We’ve never returned to the same hotel before, but I think that we will go back here again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2017,5,Our first experience of Riu Tikida Agadir,"This was our first trip to Morocco and to the Riu Palace Tikida Hotel, however we traveled with my brother and his family who are frequent visitors to this resort and hotel, at least 2-3 times per year. The hotel was amazing, spotlessly clean and staff could not do enough for you. They were professional at all times, attentive and caring, ensuring that your stay was relaxing and enjoyable. Restaurants offer a vast amount of well prepared food to cater for everyone's dietary needs at sensible times throughout the day. I have read reviews about branded spirits, but really can't understand the fuss they are making, local wines were lovely and plentiful, younger members of the group sampled many of the cocktails on offer and staff were helpful in suggesting alternatives to sample.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel has an impressive reception area with lots of comfy seating & piano bar. It is a little dark but this won’t spoil your holiday! Lots of positives from this hotel, good food quality & choice, nice Moroccan restaurant & fusion restaurant , good choice of cocktails & wine. Found the staff freindly & polite & particularly liked the waiter Youssef! The rooms are very adequate, quite large, tv, wifi, air con & were cleaned well everyday.

Staff were very polite and always more then happy to help. The room was almost perfect as we were a couple the bed was a twin bed rather then a double bed apart from that nice sized room with air con, drinks, TV and Wifi and a balcony area Rooms were cleaned to a good standard every day.

 November 2017,5,Fab hotel best Rui we've been to,"We went to this hotel in sept it was lovely first impressions were fab it was spotless clean, the rooms were decent sizes. The pool was freezing but it was ok once u were in. The only thing I'd suggest is they played some light music around the pool We went to the spa and had the scrub and massage our skin felt amazing afterwards. Beach wasn't very good we went on there and just got harassed to buy things including fruit Food was nice at hotel you could find something everyday The drink was fab too. All in all good holiday",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2017,4,Nice Design and Lovely Pool area,The Hotel is located in the middle of the Hotel area in Agadir beach and close to the Marina. The Design is really nice and especially the Pool area is very stylish. The beach is separate from the Hotel by a Promenade with plenty of People taking a walk. The Restaurant is pretty big and loud so you have some challenges to find a Silent Spot for a Romantic dinner. The Food is good and you have a very nice choice so everyone should find something. Recommendation: try the maroccan specialties and sweets. Really delicious. The Bar area is nice and they have different Artists and Singers every night. The Cocktails are good Mixed.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,4,Family holiday in august,"A wonderful holiday, we stayed in the hotel for the full seven days as we didn't feel the need to leave it. The hotel is exceptionally clean, big without being over facing and very well laid off it. The only thing that let it down was the 5% of staff that obviously would never smile no matter what Job they had but that's the same where ever you go. Food was varied with different choices every night although your staples were always available ( cous cous chips pasta breads)",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,4,"Very pleasant stay, extremley clean!","Holiday with friends, very pleasant hotel, extremely clean! Food really good with wide variety I would however refrain from the Hamam Massage, having presumed this was the same as I had in Egypt, my friend and I were keen to book; only to be scrubbed within an inch of our lives with what appeared to be a wire brush! Eeek! Other than that, the hotel was lovely, staff very friendly and I would definitely return",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2017,5,Amazing - can't wait to return,"Returned last week from an absolutely fabulous holiday at this hotel and can't wait to return. I've never encountered such friendly staff, in every department, for whom nothing seemed to much and who did everything possible to assist. Beautifully set out and large reception area where our check in was completed with almost indecent haste but not rushed and we were given all the information that we needed regarding the hotel and resort. We weren't too happy with the view from our room but were able to change it the next morning with all our luggage transferred whilst we enjoyed the pleasures of the pool. Food was plentiful and tasty. I defy anyone to say there was nothing that would appeal to them. I know from experience that buffets are difficult to keep hot but this one…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2017,5,Wonderful holiday,"My wife and I and our 2 children (7 and 4) stayed at the Riu Palace from 21st to 31st October. Breakfast was superb with an amazing selection of different foods, even Prosecco for those who want it. We then often did a trip in the morning and then returned for midday or so for some time by the pool and lunch. Sadly by then most of the sun loungers had often been taken and towels had run out. As with a lot of places reserving sun loungers is not allowed but happens. On our last day we left at 7.30am and most loungers had a towel on them reserving them but noone around. The Krystal restaurant in the evening is worth booking in to, as much for a change of scene as anything else.

Having read a few of the more ‘unfavourable’ reviews on here we were a little dubious on our stay but we should not have worried. The hotel, although quite large and busy was nice and clean and remained so all through our stay. The staff worked incredibly hard to maintain standards even though it was half term and lots of families with young children/teens. Our room was a little tired but nothing really to complain about just obviously well used with a few marks and bumps. Our rooms were well cleaned/serviced with clean sheets and towels.

Hotel & grounds picturesque, the food had wide variety (the posh Krystal restaurant a bit arty farty) and all were exceptional quality. We paid for an upgrade to a pool facing room which was a bit disappointing as it was exactly the same size. The weather was superb, hotel spotless, great selection of drinks. Staff very attentive.

We called reception who said they would send somebody up to our room. 11.30pm came and still nobody so we walked a distance to the reception as we were the furthest room away. The gentleman we spoke to went to get a woman to help, we moved bedrooms and were told to go and pack, a man would get our luggage and provide us with room cards.

 October 2017,4,Good value for money.,"There's no point in going into great detail here, it's mostly been said already. Good reception, large clean rooms, great waterfall shower with endless hot water. Bars mostly good, though the cocktails were disappointing. For those that feel the need the main bar is 24 hours! The restaurants had 'staples' that appeared every day, but also a weekly rotation of a large choice of other dishes and mainly good quality. The Krystal fusion restaurant was a great let-down. Tasteless octopus carpaccio. I couldn't even cut, let alone chew my 'fillet' steak and I saw at least 4 more returned. The millefeuille was burnt. The gardens are lovely, the pools less so. Partly because the sight of children in nappies in the pool, and especially the Jacuzzi, doesn't make you want to rush in. Many…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Entertainment extremely poor except for one evening when professionals came on instead of animation team. I found that tipping waiters got me decent service after being ignored at the bar. Food ok but became ""samey"" after a couple of days. Customer service very poor. Got stuck in the lift and as hotel didn't handle this well, I complained while still visibly upset and shaken. No compassion or apology whatsoever from assistant manager of reception so complained to the reception manager.

 October 2017,5,Great hotel for a relaxing holiday,My wife and I have been coming here at least once a year since it opened in 2012. I often look at the reviews on tripadvisor and I would make the following comments which will hopefully reassure persons put off by some of the negativity. People compare it to 5 star hotels in the UK. This is not a 5 star hotel in the UK. This is 5 stars by Moroccan standards and it fully justifies that rating. The bedrooms are large and comfortable with good sized balconies. I agree there are not many drawers for your clothes but there are sufficient shelves and hanging space. You are on holiday and not quite sure how drawers are so important to some people? Persons have mentioned marks on walls etc. My experience is that people are coming and going regularly with suitcases. Staff are cleaning…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2017,5,Amazing 1st Visit! We will be back!,"Well ... What can I say about this holiday? My partner and I were looking for something relaxing and although not a major deal breaker, somewhere with minimal children. We stumbled across this hotel and thought we would give it a shot! Well, we could not have been wrong! From the get go, this hotel wowed us. We arrived at around 1.30am where we were told by our TUI rep, Hassan, that food would be provided for us after we had checked in. Which is quite surprising as a lot of All Inclusives end their drink/food selection at midnight. We were very quickly showed to our room which was amazing and had plenty of space.

 October 2017,4,Very relaxing with GREAT food,My husband and I went with my in-laws who had been in March this year so we knew the sort of standard to expect. The hotel is large but never really feels that way. The rooms are spacious with steps to a sitting area and small balcony with a towel rail which was very helpful. There are tea/coffee making facilities and a small fridge with water and a range of canned drinks. We didn't drink the drinks as they were all full sugar drinks but that didn't matter because we could get drinks 24/7 from the bar. The wardrobes are quite good but there is a complicated configuration of doors between the bedroom and bathroom as they conflict with the sliding doors of the wardrobe/tea making area.

We were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived , welcomed by the Manager and his reception staff we felt we had made the right decision. Our choice of room was provided with no quibble. The room whilst showing some signs of wear and tear ( but nothing unusual or unexpected) was extremely well appointed , spotlessly clean and this was repeated day after day by the house staff. The food was again quite outstanding with the widest choice of fresh foods , prepared to high standards and with a constantly changing and appetising menu.

A great place to retreat if the poolside became overwhelming. The hotel was very busy, but the bar staff kept everything flowing. We enjoyed a smooth cup of coffee in the 24 hour bar area!

There wasn't a vast choice of food but we always managed to find something even with a vegetarian and dairy free diet needed.

Weather has been fantastic, the hotel is immaculate, the staff are constantly smiling, they cannot do enough for you. My one and only moan is that the baked beans at breakfast time aren't Heinz and do look and taste strange. Pool area immaculate, the staff from 6pm prepare everything for the next day. They ask that you don't reserve your sunbeds but we all do...however a certain nationality starting with F and ending in E and not the Germans will take the towels off your chairs and then go mental when you challenge them, they are extremely rude to the staff and other guests also.

But I'm not sure I can visit again, the entertainment never changes, the same people are always hired. It hit an all time low last night when a group of elderly Arabic men stamped their feet on the spot, played a pipe and a drum then marched around the room. In fact half of the tables left the room mid performance. We had fun just making jokes about it all. The singers slaughtered every cheesy song they played, one of the guys with the hat performs 2-3 times a weekend misses every note. A lot of the guests could do much better performing themselves.

Here’s why: Cleanliness I am a clean freak, this place was incredibly clean. We even got to know the lady who cleaned our room. They take it seriously. I felt so comfortable and never like anywhere was not clean. Even he toilets in the public areas - are truly 5*. I lived in my element!

Staff at check inn, restaurants, bars and cleaning staff are all helpful and friendly. Rooms are clean and fridge is well stocked. If you need anything just ask the guy who comes round each day. Read a few complaints about English channels on TV. Thera are about 6 or 7 in English with 2 film channels if you need them. Service is always excellent but I would suggest tipping the staff as it's always appreciated and they deserve it. 20 dirhams at each meal and the odd tips to bar staff (about £1.60) is not much to us but means…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The staff worked very hard and couldn’t help you enough- there were a few occasions when they were under staffed at the bars but luckily for us were patient and didn’t mind waiting our turn. One thing I would comment on is try and stick with the same waiters - I.e stay in their section! It’s nice to have a familiar face and if you treat them right they will definitely repay this. The pool, rooms, reception were faultless - didn’t have to get up early to get a sun bed however if you wanted the big day beds I would say latest you need to leave it is 7.30/7.45!

Everywhere around the hotel is so wonderfully designed and always clean. The food, the most important part, has been great, we are both vegan and was a little worried but the food has been fantastic, there is so much selection it greatly appeals to meat eaters, vegetarians as well as vegans.

We both enjoyed the food and always found plenty of choice to suit all tastes. Pianists and singers in the bar area in the evening which was pleasant. The organised shows were very amateur, we tried a couple of them but didn't last long but this was the only thing not top class.

No longer optics in the rooms and the room was dirty and smelt stale when we arrived. Our cleaner was very good and cleaned thoroughly the next day but still not a good impression to arrive too. The buffet food is very good and the only comment is that it could do with more variety between lunch and evening menus as we had the same on offer at both times. Don't recommend the Krystal restaurant, there was something wrong with each course. No cutlery for the appetiser - I don't want to pick up a piece of fish with my fingers to eat it.

Both on route there and back to the airport was easy with the taxi and made life simpler. Thomson were great and it was good to know they were always to hand looking out for us especially when the hotel manager was bullying me after I slipped and jury myself in their wet floor.

Our room as always was kept immaculately clean, with daily change of towels and bed linen. The fridge was always replenished daily with soft drinks and beer. If the soft drinks were not to your liking, then a simple note requesting an alternative would be granted. The aircon worked perfectly and we found the room suited us very well.

We decided to get something to eat & drink & returned around 3:00am & the room was still too hot to sleep in and no-one had been. Contacted reception again & asked for a change of room but someone came around 5 minutes later to fix the air conditioning, which took him about 3 minutes as he just disconnected a lead behind the ceiling panel.

The cocktails are pre-mixed and the soft drink are the same made up unless of course the machine is on the blink again and then they use the real stuff.

Cloudy days are quite common and you don't get a lot of blue sky, but can still get up to 34 degrees in September. The staff are very nice and friendly.

We loved the opulent feel of the hotel, the large bedrooms, well equipped gym, pools and availability of sun beds (irrespective of the time). On the other hand, we were not so keen on the food, although an all-inclusive hotel the food was repetitive and sometimes tepid. Also three members of my family of five had a few days of an upset tummy. There is a private zoned off area on the beach but the area outside of the zone was heavily populated and not especially friendly. We were also surprised by the lack of genuine customer service.

 August 2017,3,Acceptable but not 5*,"We had a 10 day stay at the end of August. 6 days of sun and then 5 days of thick fog and cloud. The evening fog was really horrid. Good points: On arrival our 2nd room was in a dreadful state on checking BUT Amine, on reception, did a fab job at 1:30am in the morning and gave us a suite so we ended up with 1 standard room and 1 suite. Pool was fine, particular mentions go to Tarik for taking such good care of us. Breakfast, we had excellent service at breakfast and would like to give a mention to the Breakfast Manager (sorry I didnt make a note of his name) attentive and friendly.

 September 2017,2,Management has changed,Just got home from our second holiday to RIU palace in Morocco and our third stay at a RIU. The weather didn't bother us one bit but it was sunny about 30 minutes a day. But it was nice as you could sit out all day no bother. Here's our positives and negatives of our stay... Positives- Good bar service (even though they looked lifeless) Pool was clean and big Comfy sunbeds Always got sunbeds together Great house keeping Our sink plug broke and the man fixed it quickly and efficiently The guests here are lovely Drinks and food were good Staff on front desk were helpful and generally lovely.

 September 2017,4,Andrea,"Having just returned from a weeks stay at the Riu Palace Tikida and read the recent reviews I feel the need to comment: We were around the pool area every day and saw no rats in fact the pool boys did a really good job of keeping the pool area clean. In an evening we had a choice of two bars one indoor and one out door to choose from. The dining room staff were friendly and waited till we had finished our meals before removing our dirty plates. My partner is a fussy eater and he had plenty of food choice at every meal and from the snack bar. Whilst we had very little sunshine it was still warm and no rain, I was aware that this may be the case as I did my research before booking the holiday. I found the staff to be friendly and the managers were out and about daily, the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2017,2,Awful!!!!!!,"Stayed at this hotel in September 2017, booked after being told by travel agents that the weather is really hot this time of year..... cloud everyday, no sun! Food is ok always found something to eat, staff are friendly. We was staying in a twin room, which was two single beds pushed together, so every night we always ended up with a gap down the middle! Rooms were always cleaned daily with the beds being made nicely! The thing that really annoyed me was laying around the pool on RAT watch!! Laying there cloud bathing with rats running past you!!! I just could not relax! Entertainment was poor. Nothing really going on, one show on in the evening, same thing, different outfits! Overall was very disappointed with this stay, would not return!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,5,UPDATE embarrassed and harassment at the airport,"My partner wrote a review on here on the 2nd August about an incident involving us being stopped at the airport as a result of a damaged TV found in our room after we had checked out. As we cannot change the review I thought I'd write another. The hotel contacted me following my complaint and have apologised for the inconvenience my family and I suffered. I am extremely grateful to the hotel senior manager who dealt with my complaint and have been assured that the action taken at the airport was nothing to do with the hotel but the Hotel rep (I am currently in correspondence with them). Like we said on our initial review, we would have given the hotel a 5 star rating had it not been for the issue at the airport, so as I can't change that review it is only right that i correct…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,5,"Excellent family holiday, amazing hotel and staff","Stayed at this hotel with my wife and 2 kids aged 4 and 1. We had a lovely stay with no complaints and would definitely stay here again. The hotel was busy but never seemed crowded and although the first room they gave us was a pool facing room, we didn't have a direct view of the pool or beach. We asked if we could change and they offered us a number of rooms the next day to choose from (as some rooms became vacant), they gave us access to the room so we could decide if we wanted to swap or not. Managed to get a room with a beautiful view of the pool and beach. One thing that really helped us was that our return flight was at 11PM so we checked out the hotel by midday and had the rest of the day to spend.

Positives: Fantastic hotel - great location to a clean beach and easy walk to local harbour. Swimming pool - clean and well maintained. Sun beds - lots available. Pool staff happy to help put up umbrellas or find extra beds when you arrive later in the day. Amazing food - lots of variety and choice for everyone. No one should go hungry or complain about variety. Desserts are amazing. Staff - every staff member we met were friendly, helpful and smiling. Bedroom - huge clean bedroom with great balcony. Weather - few overcast cloudy days at the beginning of our holiday, but still warm and need suntan lotion.

The rooms are great with lots of space and a fantastic shower !! The pool was lovely with lots of comfy beds throughtout the day with no need to reserve them. The food was incredible with lots of choice for all - a visit to the Krystal restaurant is a must. The promenade is perfect for an evening stroll to walk off dinner. We couldn't have asked for a better place to holiday.. definitely definitely 5* deserved !!

Oh yes staff. Wonderful people. They could not do enough for you. The service was beyond five stars. Excellent. Food was excellent too. Plenty of choices for everyone. The pool area was beautiful and the entertainment team were fantastic. They asked if you wanted to join the many activities and if you said no thanks they didn't pester you. The beach is huge and extremely clean. The whole of the hotel was spotless. We had a wonderful relaxing 2 weeks. Ventured out for a Chinese one night and felt extremely safe.

As a well travelled individual my opinion is based on an eclectic mix of experiences from the Caribbean to the Maldives, Europe and the U.K! I like to think that this review attempts to also focus the positives with the negatives but to give the wary traveller the real Agadir. Flew with Thomson which was fine, not the long haul privileges but ok. Reception at the airport great, once finally through security which was a very long process.

 September 2017,5,A piece of paradise,My friend and I have just got back from the best week at Riu Tikida Palace. The hotel was beautiful and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. I was on crutches and everyone went out of their way to assist me. The bar staff were very friendly and remembered us and our drinks order :) The pool and beach were beautiful and although the hotel was busy there was always a sun bed. Tayeb and the rest of the entertainment team were excellent and we enjoyed the activities during the day and particularly he break dancing in the evening. They are all very talented!

 August 2017,5,Palace is an understatement.. ignore bad reviews!!,"Absolutely wonderful hotel. We came to the Riu Palace as a group of four adults, and I have to say one of the most memorable holidays Ive had, I've never felt so welcome in a country than Morocco. On arrival the reception is luxurious and comfortable, with abudent seating for guests. The piano bar in reception is a high standard and like the rest of the hotel the staff are friendly and genuinely get to know you. As a family we don't tend to spend the whole day in the hotel, yet we still felt like the staff got to know us. The main restaurant is more than enough room, decorated beautifully and clean. The waiting staff are almost too attentive, constantly topping up your drinks and checking that you're ok, a great hotel to feel pampered! As for the food, some of the best hotel…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,5,"Palace in the title, a very good start!","From the moment we walked through the doors of this sumptuous hotel we were not disappointed. Even though we did not arrive until 11:30 we still received a very warm welcome and were offered a cold buffet which was quite adequate for this time of night. My travelling party consisted of myself, my husband, my daughter and her boyfriend. Even though we did not request rooms to be close to one another to our delight we were positioned right next door to each other. The rooms were extremely spacious and elegant with a lovely view of the beach. Every day our room was cleaned to the highest standard which continued throughout our stay.

Mini fridge was always topped up everyday. We had a bottle of champagne, fruit and biscuits left for us as it was our honeymoon. We also had roses left and lots of petals placed nicely on the bed. The pool area is amazing. Plenty of beds. No issues with putting the towels down at 9am then going for breakfast and coming back an hour later.

 August 2017,5,Summer hols,Had a lovely 10 days here ..the hotel is one of the best I've stayed in. The hotel is grand and opulent lobby bar was amazing. food was amazing and staff very friendly . Drinks and cocktails were fab. We dined in the fusion restaurant which is defo a must to visit but book on arrival as it gets booked very quickly..don't understand what recent negative reviews are about. Would defo recommend only negative was the entertainment was below 5* however there was a big group of us so not really an issue,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,2,So so,"Unfortunately, unlike previous reviewers we've not been lucky enough to get a clean room. Everything has an inch of dust, I have dust allergy and need antihistamine in the room! Bed is not actually made but duvet pulled over. The mattresses are very hard. Our room smells stale and is also below a hangout area meaning we're constantly hearing chairs pulled. On two occasions today, we were unable to get tea! First they had run out of mint and now hot water! Food is also very mediocre at best. The only positive I have experienced are the unattended pools and surprisingly enough the plants and greenery, which are the most maintained aspects of the hotel!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,1,3 star at best.,"I have 1 word for my experience of the Riu Tikida Palace, Horrendous!! Where do I start! I was travelling with my wife and 2 children of 14 and 11. As the rooms sleep a maximum of 3 (strange for a family hotel) I booked 2 interconnecting rooms. Arrived at the hotel at 11PM to be told there were no interconnecting rooms available and that the children would have their own room “near” our room! Staff could not understand why we were not comfortable with this! Onto the hotel itself, rooms are large and bright and are cleaned every day. Cannot fault the rooms at all. Where we faced the main issue is with the food at this hotel. I have stayed at dozens of all-inclusive hotels and can hands down say this is by far the worst I have ever stayed in. Breakfast is acceptable…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,2,Nice hotels...but not 5* service,"Three days back home after our stay at the hotel and I feel I had to leave a honest review of our stay. Firstly I echo one the previous person saying about inconsistency in staff treating certain guests with more favouritism and privileges over others... We too felt this. We booked the hotel and flights directly, nine nights for two adults and two children. Our flight was an evening flight and checked in about 11pm. We missed the evening dinner however there was cold food available for so called 'late arrivals'. When eventually checked in we were all rather peckish and was directed to the dinner hall. When went in the hall the lights were off no staff to be seen apart from the cleaning staff and the selection of cold food was limited, down to fruits and poached egg and few…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Staff in restaurants very lazy they don't clean fast enough tables you have to asked them to move dirty dishes, food is ok but not as many varieties like in others riu hotel. I had a feeling that the staff first of all serving people from own country and then the European people.

 June 2017,2,Harassed by staff. Worst holiday ever.,"Two of us stayed here last July. (Two girls aged 27) The hotel it's self was lovely. The room was spacious & clean. The grounds and hotel were kept spotless, however I'm afraid that is the only positive I have to say about our stay. The breakfast set up is extremely strange to me. You are sometimes sat on a table with complete strangers! Why not separate the tables?! If you don't get down before 9am, don't expect to find a sunbed. If you do venture down before that time have fun sitting in the shade until about 1pm which is about the time the sun finally comes out. The cocktails were horrendous. We were so excited to have our first pina colada on arrival, to say it was a disappointment would be a massive understatement. Expect cocktails from a carton and you won't face the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,1,Not up to standard,Having been on a number of TUI all inclusive holidays this has been by far the worst. Staff are very friendly however it is evident that they are stretched!! Food average and the dining experience very chaotic. Kids entertainment extremely poor(age 11 and above). Pool towels very grubby and although believe they are washed each day many covered with stains etc. Complaints have been raised with TUI Rep and in his defence he has tried to rectify the complaints we have raised. He is a. Dry good Rep but his hands are clearly tied. Given the average food we have eaten out most nights and I must say the restaurants we have visited have been fantastic. We are very disappointed with this hotel and we certainly won't be coming back or recommending it to any of our family and friends.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I've seen some reviews say that staff treated some people better than others e.g. if you gave them a tip, well we didn't tip staff but we did give them a smile, talked to them, had a laugh and joke with some, used our manners - in my opinion, that's why they treated us well because we treated them well. The food was absolutely amazing with a fantastic choice for all times of the day - we also tried the Moroccan and Fusion a la carte restaurants, both fantastic and also the Italian, buffet style, would recommend booking all three. The pool and pool area is lovely, with loungers, sofas, canopy beds etc - we never had trouble getting sunbeds (we used to go down about…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,1,Very disappointed,"Firstly arrived and we had been allocated the wrong rooms, my family were split apart on the first night. A la carte restaurants not up to standards that we have had previously. Certainly not 5* rating! Lunch time restaurant is not big enough to accommodate all the guest, you wait for tables, stand in large lines to get food, often food is not ready. Not enough activities for children who are too old for mini club! Yesterday someone was sick by the side of the pool, after informing staff, the sick lay there for over an hour before I then had to go and find the manager to deal with it. Would never come back!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,4,"Nice hotel. Busy, busy, busy.","Nice hotel and grounds. Beds do get reserved by people keeping their towels from the day before then going about their business and changing them when they decide to use the bed. This also leads to a shortage of towels. Had to wait for them on a couple of occassions. As i'm writing this, just witnessed a guest with four used towels under his arm ask for more and kick off when the attendant said there weren't any.  Food ok. RIU always one of the best AI's for this IMO. To avoid the crowds have breakfast before 8.30 and lunch before 1.30. Otherwise it's a bit of a chore but only because it's so busy. Krystal and Marrakech restaurants are good. Italian was buffet style and apart from the lasagne (which was nice) the other fare on offer was the same as the regular buffet.

Disappointed with the room; for two adults and a twelve year old there are two drawers for clothes, and not enough hanging space. The tall standing lamp didnt work in our room (eventually replaced), the curtains were hanging off the runners (eventually repaired), and the less said about the wooden louvre doors to the bathroom the better. No privacy whatsoever - may not bother some people, but maybe just whistle whilst you're in there 'dropping the kids off at the pool"" The main issue for us. FOOD POISONING!

There are many things that make this hotel amazing, food is good especially the al a carte restaurants and the setting. The reason I am writing this review is because there are some things that I feel could be improved. We have stayed in many hotels ranging from 3-5 star. This hotel classes itself as a 5 star hotel but there are some things that I believe need to be a 'MUST' or even just an expectation for guests who purposely choose this class of hotel.

My reasons for not giving 5 was due to a few minor issues. Nevertheless the children loved the stay and the food is good. My advice is not to go to eat between 1pm and 2pm as everyone goes at this time so you end up waiting a bit for you food. The entertainment from the animation team is very good, bear in mind that these teenagers work every day through the summer months with no break. If you complain about them they lose there job.

We were greeted with cocktails upon check-in and our bags were taken straight off us with no fuss.

 June 2017,4,Nice but busy,"Stayed here for 2 weeks at the end of July/beginning of July. It was very busy with lots of Moroccan and European children who had already broken up for the summer holidays. The food was good. Room a nice size. The main problems were trying to get a sunbed and the level of noise from kids and from people playing their music at the pool too loudly. If like me, you want a quiet, relaxing holiday then you either have to go when all kids are still at school or go to an adult only hotel. For this reason I would not return.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Firstly, the room walls are very thin and sitting in our room at the moment we can here everyone around us. Secondly, last night at around 4 am a fire alarm was set off by someone smoking and luckily there was no fire because neither me or my sister was woken by this as it was very quiet my dad had to come in and wake us up.

The staff are exceptionally friendly and go that extra mile. Never really cued for a drink, and was very pleased not to see drunken behaviour. ""Pool Police"" do check (about every other day) that unattended towels on sun beds are removed. If you want a really good spot, simply pop down with your towels and a book at about 0815, then from 0900 you can leave your towels for 90 minutes.

Having all inclusive was also great especially with a child as you also had snacks available during the day too. The rooms were very spacious and cleaned on a daily basis. We had a safe in our rooms too and a lovely big balcony. Entertainment did let the hotel down in my view as there were a few shows each night and a singer but they were not great they defiantly need to do more at night maybe a pool…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,5,Jean Schiech,"I have just returned from a two week holiday to the Riu Tikida Palace Agadir. The hotel is amazing. The rooms are big and comfortable and the maids keep them spotless. The restaurants are very good and the food amazing . Yes it's buffet but there is something for everyone's taste. The staff in the restaurants, bars and reception are extremely helpful and friendly. The pool area is always being cleaned and the guys who work around the pool make sure everyone has a sunbed and shade. It was so nice not having to get up at the crack of dawn to get a bed . The hotel is central and next to the beach. My only negative point is the animation team . The entertainment is good but the team are not so friendly as other RIU hotels I have visited . My holiday overall was excellent .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,4,Family trip,This is our second trip to Morocco but 1st trip to Agadir. RIU place was nice but not the best RIU palace we have been too. One of the best things was the no reserve sun bed policy before 9am. Any towels placed before this time are removed and a printed note left in the area advising your towels have been moved . Day 1 our ceiling between the bathroom and main room fell down . It was repaired within the hour and we were offered another room but settled on a free late check out instead. Day 10 safe stopped working with items locked inside . Fixed within 2hrs There is a beach but we on this once as we had 2 teenage girls and they get a lot of attention from the locals Lovely promenade with shops and Macdonalds KFC PIZZA hut but again we were approached a lot along this…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,5,Lovely holiday,"My partner and I recently visited this 5 star hotel for 11 nights and we both agree that is definitely deserves that rating. The hotel itself is very large with 4 choices of restaurants - standard buffet, Italian (buffet), Moroccan and Krystal which is a fusion of different modern cuisines. The food variety IMO was good and the quality was high too, even in the standard buffet. There is a lovely outdoor eating area which I would recommend as the ambience is much nice although sometimes you have to wait for a table. The wines were tasty and you are given a full bottle of wine with dinner rather than having just a glass so this was very good. The pool area is a highlight as there is a large pool, pool bar and more than sufficient sun beds which are very comfortable. A 30 second…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,5,Smiles from beginning to the end!,"This hotel is great! From the moment we arrived the staff were waiting to make the holiday as comfortable as possible. Our flight meant that we arrived at midday but they had kept the restaurant open for all the new arrivals could have dinner. The salon bar is open 24/7 and so got those who want to make it a late one, you can. We had a standard room and it was huge! The mini bar is topped with basic soft drinks but you can request alcoholic drinks if you desire. Nothing is a problem. This is a family hotel but not over run with kids or crazy activities. It is focused on relaxing. Which was exactly what we were looking for. Sometimes during the morning, due to the high temperatures, there was a sea mist that would clear by lunchtime. All the restaurants are fantastic and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,4,Extra holiday week,"Just been for a weeks holiday with sister, found this to be a very large hotel with an enormous reception which also doubles as the twenty four hour bar. Very clean place and staff all very helpful. This is classed as a five star but personally I would class it as a four. We were in room 362 which is on the corner by the lift and you can hear everyone coming to the lifts also the balcony looks onto the walkway from reception so was unable to use it , unless you don't mind waving to people walking past The food was plentiful and varied but I found the two restaurants to be very canteen like because of the size although very clean and good waitress service. Wine served by the bottle at lunch and dinner. Hotel is right on a beautiful long beach so lovely long flat walks after…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,4,Good Hotel,"This Hotel is very nice , rooms are big and well cleaned with large balcony or terrace. Rooms have a well stocked fridge as the Hotel is all inclusive. Location is good right on promenade and beach. Staff and service are very good . Breakfast and evening meal in the restaurant are pleasant but for some reason lunch time in the dinning area is a busy hectic experience . The reception restaurant and bar staff are all very attentive. The animation team are fun and work very hard. On the down side the pool outside is very cold and I feel the entertainment a little bit repetitive. The best night we had for entertainment was the evening a live band came to play .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 July 2017,5,Fabulous!,We arrived late July and was immediately greeted with a kind and friendly atmosphere. Reception was so helpful every time and our room on the fourth floor was spotless. Rooms: our room had a large bed and a sofa bed which was very comfortable. The wardrobe area and bathroom was large providing us with a lot of space which was fantastic. The mini bar was stocked daily and a safe is provided as well as the room being cleaned every day to a high standard. Pool: in my opinion the pool area is beautiful. On our first day we was very concerned we would struggle to find a sun bed however at 9:15 we could of chosen pretty much anywhere! On numerous occasions we took a trip in the morning and in the afternoon the pool boys were more than happy to help you find sun beds. Please do not…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Check in was quick and our bags were taken to our room and we were offered a drink and was told food was being served if we were hungry. Room: We had a room on the 4th floor and it was lovely. We had a little front room area with sofa and table and chairs. Bathroom was big and everything was so clean. Balcony had a view of the mountains which lit up at night. Our room was cleaned everyday with fresh towels. Everyday the bed was made differently which was a nice touch. Food: Couldn't fault the food at all. It was always hot and they had something for everyone (even me and I'm a fussy eater) breakfast was always nice and the omelette station was really good!! We only ate in one of the themed restaurant which was…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,5,Wonderful Stay,"Our holiday in Agadir started by a very warm welcoming in the rui tikida palace , the stuff were very polite and helpful , our double room was as expected , very clean , very large and well decorated . We booked 1 night desert trip with Ecolodge Adventures after a long search in google and yahoo , but finally we found what we want . Many thanks to the hotel stuff for their patience and help .

Take a walk outside the hotel - front and back! Beautiful environment. Can not fault this hotel, would definitely recommend and would definitely return. We have been to so many countries, but morocco is my favourite country, and this hotel is up there with my favourites.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,5,Wow wow wow,"Stayed here for a week in July and had s fantastic time. The weather wasn't perfect ( cloud all day but very warm) but this is a review on the hotel not the holiday overall. Despite the cloud however o got a great tan! This is a lovely hotel where the amazing staff cannot do enough for you. We talked to the new manager ( Carlos) outside the lunch restaurant one day and he was approachable and keen to hear how our holiday was going. The variety of food is very good and I would certainly recommend trying the Moroccan food. The various pancakes at breakfast are lovely, especially with fresh fruit and honey. If we were not sure about something we found the staff were always happy to explain what it was and encouraged us to try. Moroccan figs were new to me and our waitress…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,4,relaxing stay,"Stayed at Riu Tikida palace two weeks ago, I'd highly recommend this hotel, especially for families. The rooms were always immaculate, the variety of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner was plentiful and delicious. The private beach area was extremely relaxing. Only fault would be that the crystal and Moroccan restaurants as they did not meet to our expectations, food wise, however the rest of the stay was faultless.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2017,1,Embarassed and hassment at the airport!,This was our fourth visit to this lovely Riu hotel and it hadnt changed. It is still extremely clean and well maintained. Many of the staff are very attentive and really go that extra mile to deliver great customer service especially Redoune in the breakfast and dinner outside dinning area and Rashid in the lunch area. This was our first visit during the summer months and the expectation was for sunshine as per our previous out of season visits. But no. Six out of ten days were thick with low laying cloud and mist and apparently it is always like it in July and August. However it was still 20 plus degrees and didn't stop us doing what we wanted to do. We love to visit the local souk and it us a fantastic way to spend a few hours mingling with the locals and haggling for…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,4,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff but would not return to Agadir!","We arrived at the hotel during the night and check in was fast and easy and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful (you can also exchange currency at reception) The hotel it's self is absolutely stunning, very big and immaculately presented. Rooms are clean, free mini bar with soft drinks are restocked daily and the maid service is great (our made left our bed throws in different shapes every day which we thought was sweet) Food- Food in the main restaurant is great, plenty to choose from and if you ask for a glass of wine you are left with the bottle which is good! The 'Italian' is a buffet restaurant with exactly the same food as lunch and in exactly the same place. We did book the Krystal but then after reading the menu we had to cancel as it was so limited…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,4,Fantastic hotel - be warned about Agadir weather,"I'd highly recommend this hotel - the rooms are very large and clean, the pool area is fantastic and there is also a beach area allocated to the hotel with free sun beds. There is a great deal of variety in the buffet restaurant and if booking through Thomson you are allowed one visit to each of the other hotel restaurants per stay (free of charge). These are: Another buffet restaurant specialising in Italian food, a Moroccan restaurant & the Krystal a la carte restaurant. The Krystal restaurant was the thing I was most looking forward to having had it hyped up by other reviews on TripAdvisor - to be totally honest I didn't think it was anything particularly extraordinary but it was enjoyable all the same. Not a criticism of the hotel at all but I would feel guilty…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,3,Great hotel BUT....,"Firstly this is a great hotel and the staff in general are good, they remember your drinks at breakfast, dinner and tea and will try to make the stay as pleasant as possible. The food is good and plentiful and when we visited the fusion restaurant we were looked after and the food was nice However, 2 big reasons why I cannot give this hotel a 5 and why I wouldn't be returning On our first full night there, the ceiling in our room fell in, we were in the room at the time but thankfully on the balcony when we heard the crash of the ceiling on the floor (see photos) We immediately called down to reception who informed us someone would be up right away, we waited a good 15 mins before deciding to head down to reception, at this point it was 9:30pm(ish). At reception we were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,4,Good Hotel,Was there for 10 Days. Eat out in a restaurant (Pure Passion) review to follow. Had a good time the food was good quality. Room was very good and quite. The pool was big but busy (School's Out). Go here you will have fun.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,3,Hit and Miss,We went on a package holiday with Thomson holidays. First impressions at the hotel were good. We arrived late evening and as we had arranged taxi transfers beat the crowds to reception. Reception staff were quick and helpful and the hotel had arranged a buffet for those that were hungry. Our bags arrived quickly. The rooms are a very good size with a sitting area and good sized bathroom. Due to the humid climate (more later about that) the room did feel a bit damp at times. If you don't put the card on your bed for a change of bed linen you will not get your room cleaned properly and only a cursory clean will take place. The pool area is a good size and kept very clean. We had no problems with sun beds at all and always got a good bed without the need for an early start.…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,5,Great start,We came last Feb and arrived again two days ago. Food is still fab loads of choice and bottles of wine left at table. No probs with sunbeds staff are removing towels before 9am now so no need to rush. Music around the pool is fine. Staff have been great in all bars. Sea mist has been around most of the time but definately still tanning and warm.My main gripe is the music in the bar in the evenings. It is old fashioned you have to be at least 70 to like it. Management need to tell him to play tunes from the 80/90/00/10. Will update if things change.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,5,Amazing,"1 week holiday with family & friends . Hotel is amazing , spotlessly clean , friendly staff , fantastic food , large rooms ( pool facing twin ) . The most amazing hotel lobby with plenty of polite staff , breakfast lunch & dinner all great choice & great quality . Things that could have made it better : coffee being available in pool area before 10 am & drinks available in pool area after 6 pm - sea fog quite regular during the day until 6 pm would have been nice to have a late afternoon / early evening drink by the pool , ice cream available at bars as oppose to only in restaurant . Overall the hotel gets full marks as the facilities & staff were fantastic",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 July 2017,5,"Great hotel, ignore the negative reviews !","Just returned from a blissful holiday at the Tikida Palace. Have been to many all inclusive hotels over the years at different parts of the world and this is up there with the best of them. Some of the comments on trip advisor from other people regarding faults are mostly laughable. Ok the nightly shows were on the whole poor. But if that is your holiday necessity then go to London. If you don't like mosquitoes then go to Blackpool. And if you can't find anything to like to eat with a massive daily hot and cold buffet (check out You Tube) then there is a McDonald's and a KFC about 100 yards away as that's probably what you are used to. If you just want to chill out, then this is the place for you. If the hotel management read this, one thing I would change is that I'd keep one…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,4,Girls Break,"Value for money myself and my friends couldn't fault this resort! We had 3 girls in a Junior suite and it was very clean and spacious and all had our own comfy beds, even the sofa bed was very comfortable. The outdoor pool was always very busy to find sun loungers but hey apart from that it was lovely and big pool with a swim up bar perfect for our trip. The food was great and a good variety for a buffet. All in all it was a great cheap last minute all inclusive holiday and would return.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,4,Disappointing,"We have stayed here a few times before & enjoyed it so hence returning. This time, however, it has gone downhill. It's only little things like no Welcome Drink on arrival, no small towels in the room, no electricity for 2 or 3 hours on the second day which took 3 x phone calls to sort out. Our water has gone off on approx 6 times, no Sparkling Wine on our first visit to the Krystal Fusion Restaurant, no cushion on the Balcony Chair etc Not big things I grant you but not up to previous Visits sadly. Not sure if we will return. We still have a week left to go ......",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,4,Massive but lovely,The Hotel foyer is lovely. Plenty on hand to take your luggage to your room. Our room on the first of four levels plenty of lifts.The foyer is on level three.Outdoor swimming pool and a restaurant on level one plus to bars.Amazing 24 hr drinking if you want it as well.Would say it's a beautiful hotel but the rooms need a little updating. The staff and waiters were plentiful and very nice too.Would go again but I would ask for a room on level three next time .The private beach only yards away also lovely. The rest of the beach very busy with the locals and a little untidy . Lastly great free internet all over and on the beach a real plus .,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The entertainment and fitness team get all the credit for working hard, making our stay fun and entertaining! Plus full marks to the chefs too and the staff in the evening dining. The food was great all day and night. The drinks flowed and everything was done with a smile. Our room was huge! A slight problem with the air con on the first night which was rectified the next day. Best thing about the hotel.. the swim up pool bar! The location right on the beach is ideal too. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Rooms are spacious and always spotlessly clean, along with the rest of the hotel. A few English channels on the tv too. We always got a beach towel even late morning and always got a nice comfy sunbed right near the pool no matter what time we arrived. We were unfortunate with the weather as it was mostly cloudy but still hot and came home with a nice tan ! The staff here are amazing, they make you feel like you're the only ones staying here. They all speak very good English, and will go out of there way to make you feel like you're at home. Mohammed at the lobby bar is great, and very friendly.

 July 2017,4,Wouldn't return but not the hotels fault,"After reading most reviews, I'm unsure what people are going on about with struggling to find sun loungers. Myself and my partner did not come down to the pool until 1030-1100 most mornings and never struggled. What exactly are the ""best located loungers?"" Surely it is personal preference and my preference is not by the pool where everyone has to walk past you. Yes, these loungers are generally gone early, but there is loads around in good areas. There is a 24 hour all inclusive bar in the main hotel reception area. The mini bar in the hotel is free and is topped up every two days. It is filled with pop and water, but you can request beer as well. The food at this hotel is good, with a healthy selection.

 June 2017,3,"Great location, not so great hotel","Agadir is a destination for sunny holidays and this hotel can guarantee a great place in the sun. With great poolside area, comfy loungers, parasols and free towel service, it even has a nice little hump that keeps you separated from promenade street sellers and stares so that you can relax in the sun. Or if you like open waters, there is a private plastic lounger area by the ocean. Unfortunately the best located loungers are taken by 06:00 and after 10:00 you might be stuck with not so comfortable plastic lounger. Poolside personnel are not really bothered with no reservation policy or shameless people who take two mattresses for their loungers, so you might have to confront someone yourself. Similar story with the towels, they sometimes run out before 10:00 and you can be…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,3,Nothing special,"I stayed there with my partner last week. The hotel was grand and clean. The cleaners where lovely, efficient and done the hotel proud. On the other hand the overall stay was only satisfactory. The food was standard. The fancy restaurants where left overs from lunch - krsytal was nice. The entertainment was shocking and the bars close to early! The pool bar closes at 6 which is way to early! The security chap was friendly always and actually fixed my partners broken sunnys. I wish it was more than it was for the price we paid!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

They bend over backwards so please do tip as these people deserve it. I am well travelled 5 star hotelier and this hotel is definitely up there with the best. You have to ask for premium spirits but they do have these on show in the 24 hour lobby bar. The food is delicious, plenty of variety for everyone and cannot fault it. The rooms are spacious, beautiful and clean. The weather can be hit and miss in Agadir so if you're a sun worshipper Agadir is probably not for you. There are not a lot of forums on the weather and the BBC reports that it is sunny from early morning. This is not the case! It is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel grounds and pool area are lovely, no issues getting a sun lounger even in the afternoon. The food was nice, good selection in the Buffett restaurants, the Krystal restaurant in particular was a highlight. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, we were never waiting long to get served - both at the bars and the restaurants. The only slight downside to the hotel was the entertainment as it wasn't quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. However, the excellent Wi-Fi made up for this problem. We went of a few excursions and would recommend the atlas trail trip in particular. Overall a perfect holiday, would love to return one…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,4,Not entirely what I expected,"The hotel looks beautiful with lovely decor. Staff are friendly and accommodating but they spoke little English. We first stayed in a room on the first floor which was very nice, spacious and immaculate. However, it was a dim room and was facing a back road (wide alley). The locals were very loud especially at night and when opening the balcony door they would attempt to wave and have conversations so this made it uncomfortable to spend time on the balcony or just open the balcony doors. We paid for an upgrade to a pool view room on the 4th floor which was also like the other room described above but with a lovely view. The bathroom light wasn't working during our stay which made it difficult when applying my makeup. The air conditioning would only work sometimes. There…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I really enjoyed my stay. However, there were a few issues which started to annoy me more and more as my stay progressed. - Pool : I'm neither English, German, French, nor Belgian and I can tell you that every nation is at fault regarding the pool loungers.

The hotel was spotless, it was constantly being cleaned , all the staff were very helpful, the room are larger than average and cleaned daily, with comfortable beds.

 July 2017,5,Lovely week away,"My girlfriend and I stayed here at the end of June going into July. We have had a fantastic time, the food and drink is brilliant and the staff even better so. Especially Imad working on the pool bar, a very friendly happy chap working so hard ensuring that your day around the pool is perfect! The rooms are very spacious and have everything you need. We will definitely be returning to this hotel, we would both highly recommend to others.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2017,4,Riu Tikida Palace,"We stayed here in January after booking a last minute holiday; the weather was hit and miss but was expected for the time of year. We arrived around 14:30 to be advised our room was not ready. We got ourselves a drink and had a look around to kill some time. 1 and half hours later the room was still not ready, so was given a different room. We then had to wait another hour for our cases to arrive at the room. Given check-in should be available from 14:00 this did disappoint me but it wasn’t the end of the world! The hotel has 2 pools next to each other, one of which is heated. There is a swim up bar which is in the unheated pool but was not open whilst we were there. The hotel and room was spotlessly clean and very modern, topped up with water and soft drinks daily. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,2,Very average,"Hotel is nice looking with an average pool for the money your paying, rooms are lovely apart from it wasn't very clean in our one when we arrived. Staff are not great especially pool bar staff, they will only bring your drinks over to you if you tip them. One day we got told the bar was shut and then 5 minutes later they served a few girls which I think is absolutely ridiculous. The buffet is ok for about 2 days but after that it's very repetitive which virtually no Moroccan food. Usually A la carté is amazing at restaurants but it's nothing special here, the Italian A la carté which we were most looking forward to was actually inside the buffet... All in all, what you pay for is what you get but I will not be returning to this hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,3,Not As good as it was,"This is our 2nd visit to Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. The first time was amazing, we still enjoyed this trip but I'm sad to say it have gone downhill. Good Points Hotel is very clean Rooms are Lovely Close to Beach Kids Club very good and Katty is brilliant with kids Breakfast and Dinner staff are amazing, really helpful Nora,Kamal and Walid deserve special mention. Bad Points Beds around the pool is farcical (staffed paid to reserve beds) would have to get up circa 6am to get a bed. Pool bar staff are miserable and unhelpful Lunch table staff are lazy and unhelpful Food is very poor unless you like all your food fried, virtually no Moroccan choices Entertainment is dire, no children's entertainment even though this was advertised. Entertainment staff are just kids who seem to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2017,5,Another visit and another amazing holiday!,"I will keep this short. Travelled with two friends who like high end holidays. They and us cannot fault the Palace. Staff for some reason seem friendlier than ever. The food is plentiful, diverse and extremely tasty. The hotel is spotless and any issues are addressed as quickly as possible. If you want to find faults you will, if you say it's not a proper 5 star then pay £5k and go somewhere else. If you appreciate the effort made by all staff and the beautiful surroundings you will enjoy. Most of all though, please show respect! The Riu Palace cannot change the weather or the amount of bugs/mossies etc. Please refer your complaint to Mother Nature.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We've been on holiday to Egypt for the past 14 years, but we know where we're going to next year again...Agadir! :-) Hotel is superbly clean and staff are welcoming, helpful, trustworthy. It made a change not to see a single member of staff use their mobile. Food was fab, full range of meats, fish, salads, burgers, pizzas, rices, pastas, and of course lots and lots of cakes (!) 5/5 without a doubt.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Rooms were of good size plenty of wardrobe space, tea and coffee making facilities, fridge/ mini bar free as is the safe, Our room was cleaned thoroughly every day. The hotel was kept spotless as soon as an issue happened it was dealt with I don't feel you can ask for more than that. The food quality is good as is the choice, proper bacon lovely omelettes, and those that say otherwise Mc Donalds is down the road and that's probably your level, The staff in the restaurants are superb as were all the chefs.

 June 2017,5,Ideal,"We have just returned from a lovely one week stay in RIU Palace hotel. Food: The two a la carte restaurants (Krystal and Moroccan) were fantastic. It was a shame you could only go once to each but given how nice they were this was understandable as otherwise they would always be fully booked. Couldn't fault the staff or the food here at all. The main buffet was also excellent, but occasionally lacked variety. The pizza/pasta options were average at best, but we didn't eat a lot of that as the other food was much nicer. The starters were great (pate, soup, prawn cocktail etc), as was the tagine, and the grilled fish. Room: We had a twin room with a pool view, which was huge and very nice.

The pool was very clean and the gardens immaculate...beach lovely to walk along though you do tend to get hassled with sellers.The waiter service was very poor during the first week but did pick up on the second week...friendly staff to look out for are Kalisa,Samira,Youssef in the dining room.Both al la carte restaurants are worth a visit - the food is lovely...worth the wait!

Room, was clean spacious and plenty of comfy seating areas. Bathroom was twin sink but a shower bath which meant a step over. Mini bar was cold soft drinks and replenished adequately. We had a rear facing room which did not bother us. Nice patio seating area. Restaurants two a la carte nice but not much choice.

 June 2017,4,Summer holiday,"Riu review Me and my wife visited the Riu Tikida Palace for one week in June 2017. Coach transfer to the hotel was about 30 minutes. We were greeted with the drinks but check in took a while as two flights arrived at the same time so the queue was epic. Accommodation We payed a little extra for a pool view room; when we arrived we were on the ground floor facing the pool but couldn't see the pool from our room. We arrived in the dark so left it until the morning, definitely no pool view. A quick word with reception and it was sorted to a third floor room with an excellent pool view. Rooms appear to be the same, reasonably well stocked, clean and excellent decor, safe was free of charge, absolutely no problem with accommodation. 4.5/5 Food Cuisine is obviously a very personal…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The food is ok but could have a better variety. But over all lovely hotel and staff.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2017,4,Lovely hotel & staff,"Arrived home on Tuesday after a relaxing week. As others have already said the hotel is spotless and rooms spacious. Housekeeping was excellent. We stayed in room 2049 on the top floor and had a sea view which was an unexpected bonus as we only booked 10 days before departure. I have read other reviews that complained about lazy and moody staff. I'm afraid I have to disagree. Every member of staff I came into contact with was polite, friendly and couldn't do more for you (and that was without tipping!) I think being pleasant goes both ways tbh. The staff work so hard and I certainly never saw them on their mobiles and ignoring guests as others have mentioned. The only rude people I came across were a few French/German guests who thought it was perfectly acceptable to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We also took family photos in and around the hotel with Abdou who was really helpful and was absolutely fantastic with his job and was a really friendly guy,thank you abdou for making our stay so memorable by giving us amazing pictures of our lovely memories of Riu palace.

The food was lovely, lots of variety throughout the whole day. The bars are great, lots of great cocktails on the menu and a lot of branded alcohol included :) We had a standard room whuch was really nice! better than we were expecting, spacious and the bathrooms are lovely. We loved the pool and the hotel is right on the beach :) A couple of very minor points ... the tables in the main restaurant are quite close together, so can feel like you are having dinner with the people next to you.

Hotel guests were mainly Germans and French. . 1) Rooms: my room was at second floor, really BIG and well equipped, extremely clean and everything was looking new, housekeeping was ok. The only minus is that they don't give you any bathrobe or slippers, but this has not been a problem. 2) Food: excellent, plenty of choice, always delicious and always fresh. Same goes for beverages, no cheap all inclusive spirits but quality ones only. Real coffee (not instant one and not the ""dirty water"" they are usually giving in all inclusive resorts). 3) Hotel staff: receptionists, waiters and other hotel staff are wonderful, always ready to help.

Breakfast, lunch and dinner was lovely, we always sat outside which was so peaceful. as inside would always be very busy, hot and loud. The majority of waiters were very helpful and attentive but some were not so, however I do understand that it's Ramadan at the minute so they are easily irritable and it can't be nice serving food all day when hungry and thirty. The waiters will bring your drinks to the table which is so helpful so you don't have to carry plates and drinks together. Only downside of meal times is they need some extra areas with buffet food as it was always very crowded with people trying to get food and you would end up waiting ages due to people…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

In terms of the service, however, this was absolutely not 5 stars rated.

 June 2017,4,Wouldn't rate this as 5*,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel from 12-19th June. The hotel is HUGE. There are over 4000 rooms in total. We flew with Thomson (TUI) and had a rep our entire stay who was very helpful and gave us lots of information. Upon first impressions this hotel is beautiful. It is very well maintained and the cleaners work very hard. When we checked in: it was about 10pm so our luggage was taken straight to our room which was great so we went straight up to our room to bed. The rooms are very spacious however our view was not great (we didn't upgrade so can't really complain) our view was of a back street - all the locals walking past at night and being very noisy which wasn't great but the hotel can't really prevent this...

I've been to a Riu Palace before in Cancun and it was truly a 5* but for the price we paid (£380 each for a week) my expectations weren't as high. Pros: - The hotel is extremely clean! Spotless! They have wires above the pool area to keep the birds out also. - The room is very spacious and has the basics including unlimited tea/coffee/soft drinks which is always a plus.

After arriving late at night we were up early at 06.00 with excitement (even though we had been feasted on by mosquitoes) and was horrified to see people walking around the pool with towels securing the best sun loungers. Even though it states that you are not allowed to this, management and staff allowed it to continue. The food was repetitive, the beer was lovely but they dont like using branded drinks unless you persist. The 24hr lobby bar was shut one night at 230am until someone complained and then it was reopened. The beds in the room were rock hard, you can ask for a mattress topper but it wont make any difference. No iron or ironing board supplied, we managed to get one eventually, but you will be lucky.

 June 2017,4,Beautiful hotel let down by food and drink,"Reviews are subjective and just a reflection of your experience and opinion. As a background, we usually go to 5* adult only resorts in the Caribbean but because of Zika virus we decided to stay closer to home. What we liked: - the rooms were beautifully appointed, the largest I've had this side of the world and reminiscent of the size of the rooms we get in the Caribbean. My only complaint here would be to have more plug sockets as they were few and far between and so we could t dry/straighten out hair infront of a mirror and only one person could charge their phone by the bed. If that's important to you bring an extension plug and problem sorted. Otherwise, top scores here. - the hotel grounds and corridors etc were beautiful and well thought out and cared for. - The towel…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2017,5,Still as good as ever!,"Fantastic hotel if you are looking for a week of relaxation and sunshine. Having stayed at the hotel before, everything is still as good as ever - food, service, rooms, pool, staff and Thomson reps. When you think about the price you pay it's great value. The hotel looks great and the staff really can't do more to serve you, from the bar staff to the cleaners. The hotel management are often visible and you regularly see staff that have built up great relationships with returning guests. Outside the hotel, there are things to do but if you are looking for a more cultural trip I'd recommend Marrakesh (Thomson's sensimar hotel there is great and good value) where you can experience the real morocco. I'd recommend getting a room on a higher floor and putting the towels out early…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We booked directly with the hotel and got a Ryanair flight. Taxi from the airport was fine. We had managed to get some dirhams from stansted airport. We had a room on the fourth floor which was lovely. Lovely bathroom and very clean. The only downfall was how dark it was. We had the lights on constantly and the balcony never really got the sun. The room was big though and probably one of the nicest we have had. The fridge was restocked every day and it was really handy to have. Reading some of the reviews on here, I seem to be one of the few who thought the beds were really comfy. The restaurant was great with a nice outside bit that was lovely to sit at in the evening.

The pool area is large with great sun-loungers and the beach is right next to the hotel, the hotel is immaculate and the staff are forever cleaning.

Here is a list of problems with the stay: The hotel staff were very rude and lazy When going to evening buffet most days you had to find your seat yourself as the staff were to busy on the mobile phones. When you found a seat the table was dirty and took the staff a long time to clean it. When at the pool bar I asked for a bottle of water and the bartender replied 'have you not got any left in your room.' I was at the bar the bartender took my order and was in the middle of making the drinks and he stopped what he was doing and served someone else.

Our room was lovely though, can't be faulted whatsoever, so spacious and modern with a regularly refilled mini bar. The food was lovely and if you're there for a week you could probably eat something different just about every day, but after a week you find yourself eating chips, pasta and pizza every single day and it gets a bit boring and repetitive.

Unfortunately it appears the reviews are dependent on your opinion of what a 5* hotel is. I wish we knew there was nothing to do in the evenings, the shows are very poor and everyone congregates in the reception and bar. There are lots of people here suffering from mosquito bites. The weather is very unreliable so don't expect sun all day, the mornings are normally cloudy and it does get out in the afternoon. However if you want music or any atmosphere by the pool you will be disappointed. Again music is hit and miss and the same .

Ages ranged from 7 to 60 and all in between. Have stayed in many RIU hotels in the past but never a RIU palace and have to say that overall this hotel apart from the premium drinks was about the same as a normal RIU. This is not a criticism as we had a fabulous time and the staff were outstanding in their efforts to make your stay the best ever. The food in the buffet restaurant was really good but visited the Krystal a la carte once and all 13 of us were very disappointed with the food but I think it was just not to our taste but the service again was excellent.

First off, this hotel categorically is not a 5 star resort. There are several amenities missing which, I our minds, felt it was more deserving of a 4 star rating. Food:- This is what lets the hotel down massively. There is very little variance between lunch and dinner on options in the buffet restaurant. 9/10 the food is exactly the same. Stay clear of meat options. Myself and my partner have had bad stomachs so we have stuck to pizza and pasta options. The hotel also lists a 24h snack bar however we are yet to find where this is??

This is a very child friendly hotel, and our kids already want to go back they had so much fun! A special mention for Younes in the Art studio; if you have children I would highly recommend them taking an art class with him - it's inspiring. The food is amazing - the variety and more importantly the quality is impressive compared to other all-inclusive hotels we've been to. We…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Worth every penny,"The amenities are impressive, well maintained and spotlessly clean, plenty of communal areas with seating arrangements for different groups of friends for evening relaxation. Rooms comfortable with fresh linens every day if you wish. Special mention for manager Alberto who is not afraid to help out staff and has rigorous eye for detail. Staff exceptionally friendly and really go extra mile to make your holiday a success. Food tasty and plentiful and presentation beautiful catering for all tastes. If you don't have a great holiday here you won't enjoy anywhere.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Our 2nd trip and re booking again,Just back from our 2nd visit and still love this place. From entrance to the hotel you are made to feel welcome and a valued guest .nothing is too much trouble for all the staff although some made our stay extra special (I'm sure everyone has their favourite staff). I highly recommend this hotel the food is fantastic we did not even bother with the speciality restaurants this time as the regular food is superb. The hotel is clean as you can expect the only mess is where guests are messy but as soon as it's noticed it's clean. Drinks are good and if you want brand names the main bar have a good choice although I enjoyed the local brandy. Entertainment is good as far as holiday entertainment goes the animation team work hard but if you stay for more than a week it's repeated.…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,4,Good but standards are slipping,"Firstly we enjoyed our holiday, but May isn't a good time for a peaceful stay, as the extra beds are crammed around the pool making it like a maze. The food isn't as good as in recent months, they keep putting something out called Meatloaf with Robert sauce for lunch, and this every other day is too much, they also don't have lamb chops for lunch anymore, and the overall standard has dropped. Everyone we spoke to had suffered from a dodgy stomach, and this is probably because they've reverted back to the old habits, of using the same utensils on the raw Pork/Chicken that they use to place the cooked meat on your plate. Apart from the cutbacks the hotel is still a great holiday destination, the rooms, staff and surroundings are great, your right next to a beach, and the cost is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,4 Weeks of Paradise,"We have stayed at this hotel many times since its opening and must say that the standard remains very high. All the staff make sure that your stay is first class. Chef Abargh provides some of the finest foods for all meals with the help of all the chefs, cooks, and kitchen staff. The waiters give a first class service in the restaurants and bars, The gardeners take pride in looking after the grounds and are well worth the mention. The maintenance team provide a quick service should anything go wrong in the room. We have seen the entertainment in the past so did not go into the shows this time. We will wait for some new shows to watch.Our room was always kept clean and tidy which is down to good housekeeping and maids. From the top management down, everyone is there to make…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Probably the classiest place in Agadir,"We stayed in Room 3113 after booking directly from RIU and were happy to be on the 3rd floor as its the same level as the entrance, main restaurants, lobby and reception. We also had excellent free Wifi in the room. The resort is very classy, with the magnificent ceilings, dark interiours, the cabanas at the pool, and we noted the fact that everything was included in the all-in, not for a moment were we asked to pay for anything extra, except when asking for a late check-out. As in most resorts: book the theme restaurants as soon as possible and get up early to get a cabana or good sunchairs at the pool. Make sure to visit the Krystal fusion restaurant, as the steak and duck we had there were sublime, but ask for rare, as english tourists have made them translate medium…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,4,Great Hotel Poor Entertainment,"This was our second choice of holiday location after our trip to Sharm was cancelled. We were not sure what to expect after doing a Sensatori hotel last year. However we were pleasantly surprised, yes Platinum is a lower standard but not by much. Hotel has 3 restaurants, buffet and then Moroccan and Fusion themed ones. Fusion was excellent and Moroccan was good. You can only visit each twice during your stay, which is enough as menu is limited. Buffet restaurant is very good which loads of choice of hot or cold food and if all else fails you have the Moroccan Corner which has a variety of tagines. Eat outside if you can, Redouane is the maitre de outside and is more than accommodating for all your needs. He is courteous and stands out in the level of service he provides. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Simply the best,"First of all I have to say one of my favourite holidays I have ever had in my life! Check in fast (stunning reception area). Got to the room, good sized room biggest I've stayed in for just a standard room. Well set out and modern. We stayed at the pool every morning and found it perfect, the beds do go early for the good spots but do what we did get up early and secure where you want. Bed we're available all day but could see some people coming down at 12 noon and expecting to get the best spots, but if you snooze you loose! Food very good all throughout the day and we found drinks service to be good. Only a couple of nights did we have to wait a little while but we did hit the restaurant at the height of service. We did tip a little and found this helped as they remember…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Fantastic Week Away In Agadir,"We stayed at this hotel in May 2017 for 7 nights booking via Thomson. Upon arrival we were offered drinks, the reception and bar area is very sophisticated and grand! Check in was very smooth and efficient, there is a porter service to take your luggage to your room but we wanted to get to our room quickly as this was a late evening flight so took our luggage ourselves. Breakfast there is a fantastic selection for you to choose from (Crepes are incredible)! There is a lovely area outside of the main buffet restaurant on a terrace where you can sit for breakfast and evening meal which we liked the best! Evening meal is also very good with a selection of different meals including Moroccan cuisine! There is two A la Carte restaurants at this hotel and you can visit these each…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,One of the best hotels we ever stayed but service can be better than this,"We stayed with you on the end of April.The food was nice trying to be different every day.Because I'm working in a hotel as well I could say that will be necessary some attention to details like:housekeeping don't clean properly the toilet,walls should be dust free and not to say the picture on top of tv(wasn't cleaned for at least 6 months-you can easily see the dust in the sun). On the beginning of our holiday the hotel wasn't very busy but after 3 days if you were going for dinner for example in the middle of their schedule you will stay at long queues for food or even for finding a clean table. It's the first hotel all inclusive were I saw the people leaving tips for waiters.I don't have a problem with that but they should be friendly and trying to offer you a perfect…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 May 2017,3,We won't be returning,This was our first visit to Morocco. Myself plus 3 friends (all female in our 50's/60's). Firstly you have to get up between 6am and 7am for a sunbed. I'm guessing people tip the pool lad to save them beds because loads were already taken early doors and the annoying thing is some people never came to use them at all. Some even left them on the 4 poster things all night!! I heard such good reports saying they can't do enough for you. Unfortunately that was not the case. I got the impression that women are second class citizens. The waiters took drinks orders from the French and also took drinks orders from couples but not once during our stay did anyone ask if we would like a drink so we went to the bar to get our own. The problem didn't end there. They also ignored us at the…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,3,Don't think I would return.,"This is my 1st holiday in Morocco,and although the buffet food was brilliant,I cannot say the same about the bar staff.I went here last week with three friends ages ranging between 53 and 65. During our stay all 4 of us felt like 2nd class citizens and not once were we offered drinks when we were round the pool.Even when we went to the bar,you would have thought we were invisible.We were ignored,,but yet if you were French or had your husband with you,then you were given priority.One day at the pool bar,,I went and ordered a beer off someone called Hamid,,,and when he finally decided to serve me,,he looked at me,,,turned to his friend Imad,said something in their language,they both looked at me and started laughing !!!!! How rude is that ? On an evening,all the other guests were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,4,Excellent Family Hotel,"Very 1st trip to Agadir and was recommended this hotel. We were upgraded to a suite on the 4th floor upon arrival. As we spent all day on the beach the view was unimportant thankfully as it overlooked a large walkway & car park. The staff, service and food were excellent. The options to book and eat in 2 alternate restaurants was a real bonus at no extra cost. The negatives which could be improved were lack of beach towels, the fact you had to queue to obtain them is very poor for a 5*, also no beach service. Having visited many 5* hotels these services are paramount for ease.and comfort. Also, the traders around the private beach area argue regularly which can be very loud and annoying but security didn't intervene. Overall this hotel is an excellent family hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,5 star holiday!,"I've never written a review for anything before but after you've been here you can't resist. Yes the hotel has very small communication issues at times but I would expect that from a hotel this size. Still I wouldn't change my rating to anything less than 5 stars! The staff who work here from the cleaners to the management are flawless. We did not have a single bag encounter with anyone! The food is amazing and we never got bored, dined in the 2 restaurants also which were fantastic. Drinks can't be faulted, the beer was good and wine very nice. They have an extensive cocktail list but you can request anything you want. The pool area is beautiful and peaceful with very comfy beds. It can be difficult to get a good sun bed spot if you come down after 10am however the pool guys…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

On checking in we where delighted to find we had been upgraded to a lovely sea view suite on the 4 th floor. The staff here are very friendly and can't do enough for you. Redouan in the dining room really looked after us well. I came down after a few days with a horrendous chest infection, he was most helpful ensuring I had honey, lemon and hot water in abundance. We must also mention Alberto, one of the assistant directors, he seems to be everywhere. works long hours, is always pleasant and makes sure you are having a lovely holiday, Any problems he quickly sorts them out. Looking forward to visiting here again,",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Sunbed Stress and Noisy Neighbours!,"Having spent a wonderful, relaxing week here earlier in the year, we decided to come back for some more of the same. However we were somewhat disappointed this time - not with the hotel or the staff - but with the inconsiderate behaviour of some other guests. We arrived very late and fell into bed only to be rudely awakened on our first morning by the slamming of the next door neighbour's door before 7 a.m. which was shortly followed by the slamming of doors further along the hallway. We gave up trying to get back to sleep and had a cuppa on the balcony instead. We were then astonished to see the amount of guests dashing about and putting out towels on their preferred sun beds which was something we had not experienced on our previous visit. Sad to say that from then on it…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,The Palace is palatial!,"Most reviews say it already. We have travelled extensively and for a relatively cheap week in the sun, this definitely fits the bill. Had a suite which was a fabulous room with perfect sea view, could lie in bed listening to the waves breaking on the beach. Downside was a noisy generator right above us, meaning our ear plugs came in handy. The standard of the food was excellent. Not very high quality toiletries for a 5* so bring your own. Also dawn raid for sun beds led to if you can't beat them join them approach, as by 9 a.m. all were taken. Might also be wise to bring your own towels, as with full occupancy these often ran out. All in all a great place to do nothing.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Paradise,"This hotel was amazing for a 4 star. The food was good. Staff very friendly, polite and helpful. The restaurant staff were brilliant. They remember your drink choices and have it ready for you. The pool was so clean. Had amazing time relaxing by pool area. Definately best hotel on the beach. Only thing missing was bathrobe and slippers. Also the drinks werent international premium drinks. But the mocktails and fresh fruit juices were delicious. Thomson reps were also amazing. Definately return to this hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,5,Amazing 10 days,"Spent 10 days at the Riu Palace in October following 4 days in Marrakech and wow where to begin, the hotel is stunning. The pools are fantastic (slightly cold) but a nice change to the temps outside, the swim up bar is a nice touch. The food was great choice and quality, every day was something different, everything was fresh and a number of fresh stations (especially at breakfast). The service in this place was also 5*, we did leave very small tips but at no point did I feel pressured too. One of the bell boys even went to the bus station to pick us up our coach tickets back to Marrakech which was above and beyond the service I expected. The resort is a little quiet and whilst we did go out and explore we realised we were in the best resort by a long way. I was apprehensive…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Even wifi is available in the room now. The staff is extremly friendly, they try to do almost everything for you. From the people working in the restaurant, the bars, the cleaning ladies, everyone greated you with a smile and a nice word. Just like friends.

I went with my wife and then in laws and we all could not fault anything. the staff have the best memory for remembering drinks ect. I have a ground floor room near the pool and had wifi in there and next to the pool. the pool is great the drinks are great. breakfast luck and dinner were all good. a word of warning agidir airport passport control are slow and rude but that's nothing to do with the resort. the reps at the hotel are really helpful to. there is loads of street sellers on the front but just say no thanks and they leave you alone. any questions just ask",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Amazing,I can't believe anyone would rate this place anything other than 5 stars. The place is fantastic and unbelievable value for money. I've stayed in some amazing hotels and would put this one in my top 3 for luxury and service. The staff are great and gave our 2 children so much attention. The guests here are also great and the hotel seems to attract a better class of clientele - no rif raf! The rooms are huge and the cleaners do a great job. The only negative comments I can make are the floors can be slippy and the tv channels are poor! If you want a family friendly holiday to just chill out by the beach or pool then you can't go wrong with this place.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,first class,once again we visited this amazing hotel and once again we were never disapointed. this is the seventh time we have been and each time it has been better than the time before . the staff (no i wont call them staff but friends)are all so good they cannot do enough for you . what ever you ask of them they will go out of there way to acomodate you the hotel and gardens are very clean and tidy to a very high standard and the cleaners work so so hard to keep the bedroons and suites in a first class standard. the food is very very good and you have pkenty of choice in the buffet dinning hall there is also two dinning options you have to book for they are the moroccan and fusion and both are supurb and the food and the service is first class you cant go wrong in choosing this hotel.…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,3,Not close to 5 star,"We generally look to have an easter break somewhere warm and all-inclusive as a reward for getting through the winter...! so we choose carefully and like a bit of luxury, though our main driver is great service and stress-free holidaying. What a disappointment here! 4 main gripes: Service - there were some really lovely individuals who were charming and friendly, particularly in the main restaurant. However the reception staff in particular were at times bordering on rude. As the front line in the hotel, we found that very surprising. A couple of examples (there are many more) - I asked for our room cards to be reset (had to do this 5-6 times in our 10 day stay), and the woman took the cards and while she was resetting them, dialled a number and started a call, rather than…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,Wow 😳,"What a lovely place, amazing staff, amazing rooms and amazing food. We were held up a little getting our room and did have to move as the view of the car park was a little underwhelming but once sorted everything was amazing. The rooms are large and if you can try and get high rooms as you get the best views unless you want to pay extra for pool or see views. Never had any problems with noise, not getting sun beds or finding something to eat. The opulence of the hotel was stunning and the staff really made the experience worth it, we did learn near the end of the holiday that early tipping pays off with service and English money is welcomed by staff. Will be back again and have told all my friends about this hotel, loved it.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,3,Average,"This hotel is generally to a good standard but they really do miss some basics. The food was good (as in good - not great or wow) and the rooms are big. The swimming pools are plenty good enough and the hotels stretch of beach is nice. The issues are what makes a 5* hotel. For example, when you go to the a la carte restaurants then you better drink champagne, otherwise you will be greeted with a finger pointed to your table. Our waiter ""Said"" literally did this with us at the Krystal restaurant, and then he had me stand and hold my baby for ten minutes before getting me the high chair I requested and rushing us to order. He was more interested in getting everybody seated and giving out the champagne evidently. RIU - GIVE CUSTOMERS A NON-ALCOHOLIC OPTION AT THE DOOR! …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 May 2017,4,Great stay at the Riu,"Just returned from a lovely week at the Riu. The hotel was lovely, rooms nice and spacious, nice pool and beach area and a fair choice of food at the all inclusive. The hotel is conveniently located for venturing out, we went with Thomson but booked all our excursions bar one through Hassan who you can find as you exit the hotel on the beach side. The prices are much better booking through him and he has a wider variety of excursions than what Thomson offer.

 May 2017,1,Inconsistent and disappointing,"We booked a 10 day stay at the Riu Palace through TUI (Thomson) in the UK and were thoroughly looking forward to our holiday as a getaway. This review is going to be critical as there are several basic areas where the hotel and its staff were inconsistent which led to a disappointing holiday experience. ARRIVAL / ROOMS We arrived on the Monday night at around 11pm, check-in was prompt and well handled. We were given the keys to our room and were told from the member of staff that it ""was a lovely room"".

 May 2017,5,Only let down by entertainment,Writing this review whilst sat having lunch. Firstly I have to say the staff make this place amazing. Always a smile on there faces and always helpful and accommodating. First time in Morocco but not in Rui Hotel which again came up to all expectations. Would recommend to anybody. Our only gripe is that entertainment is not the best and maybe could do with another bar or two and more waiter service (after all it is a palace) Will we come again DEFINATELY. Our perception of Morocco and its people were completely wrong What a wonderful place to visit.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2017,5,Brilliant Stay,"Spent a week here on a last minute booking. We have stayed in Riu hotels before and have always been impressed with them. We were not disappointed this time. On arriving check in was swift and efficient, although we had a problem with the room we were initially given (it wasn't ready) that was quickly sorted out by reception. The room itself (4075) was comfortable and spacious with a large balcony for the early morning coffee. The staff here really could not do enough to make the stay perfect, always friendly and smiling, they worked hard all day long although sometimes it is nice to be able to pour your own drink at meal times (they leave the bottle of wine on the table with you!)

 May 2017,3,A beautiful hotel but several issues would stop us returning for a second visit. Worth reading before booking.,"Overall a beautiful hotel, with very good rooms, pool area and food. However the noise disturbance was a big issue, as were several other bits which affected the quality of our stay. Worth reading if you're planning to book. Total honesty written from a fairly easy to please, like to see the good in everything person! Start with the negatives in order of annoyance, at the end some good points! 1. Noise of furniture scraping across the floors all hours of the day and night! Trust me it's loud enough to wake a sleeping giant, first thing in the morning (we aren't light sleepers) or last thing at night.

The lunch buffet is also good. We didn't get to the Moroccan a la carte, but managed 3 trips to the Krystal. The food was fantastic...

The hotel still managed meet all our, already high, expectations and again it ticked all the boxes and we couldn't really find any faults. The weather was slightly more mixed this year which is always a risk you take in February and the hotel copes reasonably well on the occasions when you have to spend a couple of hours inside.

Very good food at the buffets!!! Mainly western but you can still try some tajines if you'd like. Pool beds are very comfortable and there are plenty available. Beach is across the boulevard so very close.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2016,5,The perfect escape,"A nugget of tranquility on the beach front of Agadir. The hotel offered 5 star service and beyond, catering to our every need. The food was up there with the best I have had in a hotel. Agadir is quiet at this time of year but we immersed ourselves in the culture and the locals were respectful and courteous. Great surfing spots all along coast, our teenagers surfed all day everyday.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,4,a week in Agadir,"Just come back from a week in Agadir. Stayed at the Tikida Palace Service Consistent outstanding. In particular the waiter in on the terrace outside to buffet restaurant was a superstar. Exactly what a good waiter ought to be. People on reception were OK, but lacking in any warmth. All other staff were cheerful and friendly, going out of their way to make your stay as good as they could. Room We had a pool view room. It was big, comfortable, good bed, excellent bathroom and shower. It was clean, and kept very well by the housekeeping staff. The room was definitely bigger than many holiday hotel rooms I have been in; it had a large comfortable terrace, and good aircon and a ceiling fan. The hotel was close to the main town right on the beach with a wide promenade between it…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,Overwhelming but planning return,"Great experience overall. Ticked every box we wanted. Easy booking via Thompson, food we loved (we are creatures of routine to note) salad SO fresh & variety per meal. Staff were highlights including management (post injury I got well taken care of). We ate & dined @ odd times but they adapted easily. We already planned the return before leaving which speaks volumes 🐪🐪🐪🐪🐪🐪",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,Happy honeymooners,"When you see a hotel that is deemed as 5* You always hope its true but secretly think it won't be. I'm glad to say this is definitely a 5*!!! From the staff to the food to the pool, all amazing. We are currently here on our honeymoon with my step daughter. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. The food is always a worry but it needn't have been as it's amazing and they really do cater for all. If I was to be picky I would say there should be music around the pool but that's it.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,4,"Relaxed, friendly, efficient hotel. Great food... but no 'no-smoking' zones outside","A very relaxed and professionally run hotel. Team here are friendly and efficient; nothing seems to be too much trouble. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious and clean and are very quiet. There's NO storage outside of the dressing area (1.5 wardrobes, three shelves and three small drawers) so be prepared to use your case and surface areas for overflow. The main lounge is hyper-relaxing... With premium branded drinks it makes this very special. The wines are good (including the house ""champagne"" /blanc de blancs). The food is excellent with a lot of variety and the opportunity to try different things. The main restaurants are large and efficient and whilst they can get busy it's never been a problem. Whilst I respect the right of people to smoke, the outside dining areas in their…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2017,5,2nd Christmas holiday visit,Hotel just gets better we stayed for Christmas 2015 and arrived this year boxing day 2016 so was there for the new year. We stayed on 1st floor facing pool so much better room view this year and a room with a bath. I just loved the new year eve gala night so much effort put in for guests. Krystal fusion restaurant was fab again apparently you can book here a few times or every night so our rep this year told us. Just love xmas here. So many ppl we met was on the repeat visits and even met ppl from last year. Same staff as last year which is lovely to see. Just a nice place to be.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,4,Lovely holiday,"Lovely hotel and lovely staff, we've been a bit disappointed with the weather as it was a bit cold and windy but when the sun is out it's fine Food was delicious with lots of varieties, kids need to be accompanied by an adult if they are getting their food as if they want to get something and they are still cooking it, the chef start serving adults and leaving the kids even if they are the first one in the queue so they can stay forever to get their food, otherwise everything else was great",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,"A fabulous hotel - if you're a normal person, you'll be mightily impressed","We've literally just got back from a week here as a family. We had a great time and the hotel is fantastic. If all you want is a week in the sun doing nothing, I could not recommend this more highly. First, Agadir. If you want to see the real Morocco, this is not it. Marakech is. Agadir was also entirely destroyed by an earthquake in 1960 so whilst the ruins of the kasbah remain on the mountain top, what you see is a growing enclave being developed purely for western tourists. And that was great this time round for us. We love exploring but on this occasion, we just wanted a week in the sun with the benefit of a sea breeze. And this was perfect. There's a very long promenade which you can walk or travel by motorised trike (£5-8 per hour) from the King's Palace in the south to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,fantastic Easter break,"This is a fabulous hotel, spacious rooms, spacious pool area with many cabanas and shady areas, the staff here are exceptional, we had consistently great service. Beach is nice, sandy and great for long walks. Activities are available if you want to partake, aqua aerobics and beach volleyball were great with enthusiastic fitness staff. Food is plentiful, fresh and varied, we ate at Kristal al la carte twice and it was the highlight of our trip. Moroccan a la Carte is also very good. Short transfer from the airport, no time difference to the UK, really couldn't find a fault, unless you are exceptionally picky",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,Memorable and amazing Hotel!,"The staff at this hotel were excellent! This goes for all of the staff from the front of house at reception, maids and cleaning, to all the waiting and catering staff and anyone else you was fortunate enough to come across. The hotel's service was great and the staff at reception definitely listened to any feedback and requests and actioned upon them. First room was not so great, however they changed this for us the following day and the new room had an amazing view of the sea! Room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was spacious with double sinks and separate toilet and bath. The balcony was ok but we only spent time on it to see the view of the sea and people watching on the busy promenade below. The location was very good and the hotel was right on the beach and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,4,Great Relaxing Hotel but not 5-Star,"We booked a package holiday with Thomson and flew from Gatwick via EasyJet. Unfortunately the trip started badly with a four-our delay with EasyJet at Gatwick. AFter moving passengers around between 3 different gates we finally boarded the flight. This was my first time flying with EasyJet and I am not impressed with their organisation, especially as this flight was more expensive than the usual Thomson Flight. We were met by Thomson Representatives at Agadir Airport and took the coach transfer to the hotel. The check in process was great as all the details were completed by the time we arrived so we only had to show our passports. As we arrived at 1am, there was only some fruit available in the restaurant to eat. The hotel is very nice, had air-con in all the right places…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,4,Amazing!,"Stayed here in March 2017 for a week. First time staying at this hotel, waiters were friendly, The animation team were great & the food was delicious! The workers on the reception were always helpful! We did have an issue with the A/C in the room, we asked at reception, they advised they dont have A/C in rooms! My brothers room next door was always nice and cool because somehow his a/c actually gave off very cool air...ours only gave off a little cool air but they have fans in the room so it wasn't too bad. I have stayed in various hotels in Agadir and the only downfall for this hotel was the cleaning service, it wasn't as sharp as the other hotels. However it was an enjoyable stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,Excellent hotel,"We spent a week here on April . The weather was amazing 35° .The room were clean, comfortable and spacious. The quality of the food and drink was excellent.

We will be back soon",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,4,Lovely Easter Break,"It was our first visit to Morocco, Family of 4 (2 children), we had a lovely week in this beautiful hotel. Great location, nice views, beachfront. The friendly and hardworking staff made everything easier from the check in until the last minute. Alberto, the manager assistant was very kind an always willing to help. He was present in the restaurants for every meal checking if everything was fine with guests and even helping the staff taking care of every single detail, he was chatting to the families, giving advice and tips to go around and the most amazing thing ... he was there welcoming us and saying good bye in the lobby. The buffet and meals exceeded our expectations, there are 2 more restaurants a la carte that everyone should try. We had 2 rooms next to each other with…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,Fantastic holiday,"We have just come back from a great holiday here. This was our first trip to Morocco and won't be the last! We had a twin room, it was lovely and clean. The bathroom was big and the shower was the best I have ever used. We had a sea view from our balcony which was a bonus. The hotel itself is lovely, the public areas are spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The area around the bar in the lobby is very inviting and a great place to relax after dinner. This is the best place to use the free wifi, there is no wifi in the rooms. The food is out of this world, more choice than you can get through in a week. The staff in the restaurants are incredibly attentive and would do anything for you. Watching them interact with the children staying there was a real pleasure to see. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,First time and definitely NOT the last....,"We've just got back from a weeks stay at this hotel. It was our first time to Morocco and our first proper family holiday (with kids), and all I can say is AMAZING. We had 2 twin rooms (2 teenage girls in one and my wife, 19 mth old and myself in the other). To families looking at travelling and a bit unsure or nervous... don't be. Book this hotel and enjoy your stay stress free. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are great and the food....10/10. We normally holiday in Sharm El Sheikh at 5 star Hilton but this hotel is a much larger step above. We loved every minute of it, the staff made us feel comfortable especially with a toddler who didn't want to sit still at dinner times and made allowances for us to feed her in the lounge/lobby area so she could walk around and eat at the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,"""Perfect Easter Break""","This was our first trip to Agadir though our second visit to Morocco. Having stayed at the Riu Toureg in Cape Verde at Christmas, and not having a great time, we were apprehensive about this trip. We need not have been. We booked a junior suite (4004) and it was fabulous. The room had everything and a stunning sea view. The restaurants were brilliant and the food and drink quality was excellent. The facilities were clean and the staff were attentive and friendly. One slight negative was the poor quality and range of the wifi but overall we had a really good break and we would stay at this hotel again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2017,5,Excellent Hotel,"We spent a week here 3rd to 10th April. We had 2 twin rooms which were clean, comfortable and spacious. The quality of the food and drink was excellent. We travel a lot and this is one of the best all inclusive hotels for the food and drink quality we have been to. The staff were lovely. They were friendly, polite and attentive. We choose to tip as we think the staff deserve it. The pool area was a little crowded and needed a bit of maintenance in places but was still good. The beach is lovely and a lovely flat promenade in both directions. The sellers were a bit of a pain but most accepted a ""no thank you "" We all felt safe when walking on the promenade but it would have been more relaxing without being hassled to buy.

We were very impressed with the location, and the high standard of cleanliness and facilities, the choice of food was amazing and the service from the staff throughout the hotel was second to none, nothing was too much trouble and they all work so hard. We celebrated my husbands birthday whilst there and he recieved cards and good wishes from the hotel management and then a cake and bubbly in the evening with a happy birthday sing song from the staff.

We thought it was part of the service until we got to the coach! I wondered why two men took a case each! Very rudely the person held his hand out and said ""money"". After searching and getting flustered we told him we only had english money and he got the coach driver to change a ten pound note into coins! I learnt to keep hold of my case on the way home!

Evening entertainment was hit and miss, the talent show and the live singing was brill but the rest not so good (it was out of season). It was also my birthday whilst away and the hotel gave me a gift and made me a birthday cake and even brought it to my room for me after the restaurant closed.

Can not fault anything at all about this hotel, only one having to leave and come home. Such a good choice in the restaurant and fresh and plenty served well I was fully inclusive, the rooms are large, with a separate lounge area and large balcony, extra big bathroom.

Next, the dining, the buffet restaurant has great variety and quality backed up with great staff and a neat and always tidy setting. The rooms are large, spotless and our one overlooking the pool/lounger area was quiet and relaxing. Drinks are always available and plentiful, not that I partook as anyone who knows me will testify! We went to golf some days and left our poor wives sunbathing, which they managed surprisingly well seeing they only had pina collada to sustain themselves with. One serious word of warning: don't take the 'free tourist taxi' to the souk which is available from the front desk. You will be taken to the drivers family shop and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Rooms are fine we had a pool facing one but no sun and you can hardly see the pool.The pools are cold, even the indoor one save your sunbed at 7am. Nice food but the same everyday lunch is much better than dinner. Bar in hotel has a slow service and they prefer to serve their favourite customers 1st. Tip if you wish you won't get treated any differently. Visit the Krystal restaurant if you can it's really nice but they get booked quickly.

The weather was brilliant and was 34 degrees for 4 of the days of our holiday, with the sun shining every day. We were under a bit of pressure as we had recommended this hotel to our friends and I can safely say, they LOVED it. They went as far as saying it was one of the best holidays they had ever been on.

 March 2017,5,Very deserving of its 5* award!,"When thinking of writing this review, I sat and thought about the negatives and if the only thing I could come up with is that the pool was a little too cold well then I'd say it's a pretty much flawless hotel! With its grand entrance and cocktail on arrival to the spacious and nicely decorated bedrooms, this hotel is a must for anyone who just wants to lay by the pool and unwind for a while. The staff couldn't be more welcoming and friendly if they tried, service is spot on and from someone who is in the service industry I am hard to please! The activities run throughout the day from darts to aqua aerobics means that there is fun for everyone. The hotel is clean and fresh, the gym could do with an update (if that's what you like to do on holiday), we didn't get the chance…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The sea is just across the promenade,lovely beach continually cleaned plenty of room for everyone it's huge. The food in the hotel restaurants is amazing and I don't say that lightly, three themed restaurants, we only tried the Moroccan but we felt the main restaurant was so good why go anywhere else.

 February 2017,5,SWinter Sunshine,"My wife and I wanted a little bit of winter sun, and this all inclusive break in Agadir looked ideal. Here all inclusive really is all in inclusive. The hotel is quite big, with huge and impressive central area that serves as reception, lounge and bar. It also serves as the wi-fi hotspot, with many people checking phones, laptops etc. I would have expected a 5 star hotel to have better wi-fi coverage. The gardens and pool are really well laid out with lots of different little areas to explore. The room we had was a pool view room, probably average for this class of hotel. The balcony was a little disappointing, and our pool view was actually a large tree, but we didn't spend much time in the room so that wasn't a problem. I found the bed to be a little too hard. We did however…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,All inclusive booked with Thomson,"Excellent 5-star hotel, excellent location, with generous room sizes. The staff are very friendly, and nothing is too much trouble. The food is buffet style, with great food and a wonderful selection. The pool area is very large with plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas, with a strict policy of not reserving the chair beds. If you do then the pool staff will remove your belongings and reallocate the beds and umbrellas. Each morning, we had an excellent walk along the promenade and back on the amazingly long and wide beach. This hotel is very deserving of its 5 stars and if we return to Agadir, we would definitely stay there This is a very safe area, with each hotel having its own security, with plenty of security ( police and army) patrolling the public areas.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Never a problem getting into restaurants. We booked in all a la cartes while we were there - Italian is a buffet type very similar to the main buffet but Moroccan and Krystal fusion restaurant were both lovely. Would recommend booking all three however as you can always pop into the main buffet afterwards if they arent to your taste. I've stayed at numerous Riu's around the world and while this may not be up to the standard of some other Palace's, i have absolutely no complaints when compared to the value for money.

High standards across the board! In particular Alberto, Wahid and Khadija were favourites for my family, and took time out to go the extra mile and stunned us with their hospitality. I would 100% recommend this place as an absolute must for staying in!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,5,Fantastic hotel,"We had a great holiday here, food, staff and everything about it was brilliant, we have booked to go back again in May, with some different friends, just carnt wait ❤️ Had a room on same floor as reception which was perfect for restaurant and bar, would love a room over looking pool next time, but the rooms are soooo big, Done Aqua a few times but will tempt it everyday in may, Don't hesitate to book just do it xx",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,The Perfect Holiday,"We have just returned from the most wonderful week at the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. What can I say....? Simply the best holiday we've had in a long time. The hotel is wonderful - beautifully decorated, the outdoor pool area is stunning with huge four-poster day beds where you can relax in luxury beside the water with a constant supply of drinks in the sunshine... The hotel is situated right on the main promenade and a stone's throw from the golden beach, with a great view of the Kasbah. Nothing is too much trouble for the lovely staff. The rooms are huge and spotlessly clean, and the food and drinks are delicious and plentiful. Would highly recommend a visit to each of the a la carte restaurants on site too, which are available to all inclusive guests once per week each at no…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,Most definitely a 5*,"What a wonderful hotel! Visited as a couple in March, I could not fault a thing! We'd planned on relaxing the week we were there and boy did we relax! Unfortunately we didn't venture out of the hotel so cannot describe what Agadir was like, but the resort was huge, had all the amenities one needs! There was a shop supplying everything from souvenirs to your daily essentials, a beauty SPA, a salon and the usual daily and evening entertainments you'd find in a resort! Food and drink served all day, a mini bar (non alcoholic) refilled every day along with your usual tea and coffee making facilities! The rooms were cleaned daily and even if you did not request it, fresh towels supplied on a daily basis! When booked, it was going to be a toss up of a twin or a double, we got a twin…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,5th time and still great,Visited for a week for some winter sun between 9th -16th March. Our 5th time at the hotel and it was just as good as ever. Staff as usual were great and a credit to the hotel. Rooms very large and whole resort is clean. Food is magnificent for an all inclusive. Our thanks to Alberto and his staff for another great holiday. With regards to tipping I would suggest that this is done regularly and not just at the end of your holiday. At least 10 dirhams which is less than £1 per person seated is much appreciated by the staff and they truly deserve it. Just book you won't be disappointed. Thinking about our next visit already!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,5* but only just.........,"My title may seem a bit negative but don't get me wrong this hotel is FABULOUS!! I have just returned from my third trip to the hotel, the service, food, facilities, location and public areas are all great. I just think that the bedrooms, although fantastic in size and layout, are starting to look a little tired. If a refurb is planned an area for the ladies would be welcome, you can't dry your hair and apply makeup in a steamy bathroom so an area in the bedroom with a seat, mirror and plug would be a great improvement. Don't get me wrong I will be back and have converted another two people to the wonder that is Riu Palace Tikida, I just think the bedrooms would benefit from a refurbish to maintain its 5* rating.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,Yet another great time,"I really love this place... let me tell you why. 1. Hotel is beautiful, very clean , spacious with great views. No sun bed fighting around the pool due to the large pools and garden areas. 2. Rooms are massive and always very clean. This time we had a pool view and my friend had a sea view. The balconies are large and very comfortable. My favourite way to start the day was with a cup of tea sitting on the balcony watching the world go by whilst listening to the sea. 3. Food is fantastic lots ( and I mean LOTS) of choice at the buffet restaurant plus 2 al a carte restaurants. The cakes ... OMG. 4. Drinks -all branded proper stuff not the ""local"" drinks, cocktails are yummy, champagne (ok not real champagne but the wine was French) went down very well. 5. Staff - for me this is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,Back in love,"We last visited in November and our review showed that the hotel was just starting to slip it's standards However we gave it another go - the prices are just so tempting Well it's back an amazing week more drinks service around the pool, amazing food and fab service One niggle was 'tip wars' we always tip at the end of our holiday for good service however it feels a little like some of the staff compete to serve you to get that tip and it can become overbearing attention",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,Brilliant 5***** hotel booking again!!!,"I returned home on Monday 13th March 2017 after the most amazing week at this fantastic hotel. Where do I begin?? the start is in the reception where you meet the most welcoming, attentive staff ever where checking in is easy and simple, your luggage is then porter-ed to your room. The room we had was a standard but trust me there is nothing standard about these rooms, they are spacious and very comfortable. The balcony with street view entertained us during the day but mostly of a night. The mini fridge is filled everyday and the cleaning staff were very discreet but lovely, they left us a different bed setting every day so much so we actually looked forward to seeing what they had designed. The restaurants are brilliant too, we are foodies and the food was the best we had…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2017,5,First-class all-inclusive hotel,"The hotel is spacious and well-appointed, set right beside the wide promenade and lovely long sandy beach. Rooms are large and comfortable and facilities include three large pools,two set in attractive gardens, one of which is heated, and a heated indoor pool. The buffet food is varied and of good quality and, at no extra price for all-inclusive guests, there are pre-bookable a la carte restaurants where the food and service are really quite excellent. There is absolutely no problem about alcohol: the staff are only too happy to serve you all you want. In fact, the staff are the hotel's best asset. They are unfailingly smiling and helpful and seem genuinely to want to ensure that guests enjoy their stay,",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,Fantastic Service and So relaxing,"My wife and I have just returned from a week at this lovely hotel in Agadir, 2nd - 9th March 2017. It is a great place to relax and unwind. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable and we booked a standard suite which was a bit of a waste of money as they all overlook the road at the rear of the Hotel so if you want a suite with a pool or sea view you need to pay an additional cost for these so I wouldn't bother The pool facing rooms are just as nice and still offer plenty of space and a much better view if that's what you like. Food was outstanding with something for everyone and service was second to none whether you tipped or not. We travel a lot and have stayed in some fabulous 5 star all inclusive hotels in Mexico and Turkey and this was as good as any at a fraction of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 February 2017,3,Disappointed,"I was recommended this hotel by a friend,however,whilst it is a good hotel-it really is not a 5 star.I emailed the hotel prior to my holiday,asking for a quiet room(I am a VERY light sleeper)maybe high up and perhaps facing the pool or the sea.I received a reply to say a pool or seaview room was the equivalent of approximately 40 Euros per night extra! We arrived and checked in,we were not offered a pool or seaview room and were given,yes,a high room with a balcony-but faced the side of another hotel and no sun at all.As one of our small pleasures is retiring to our room around 4 in the afternoon and having a drink on the balcony in the sun-we could not do this as it was too cold out of the sun.I was even more angry to find out that two couples who checked in immediately after…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,AMAZING,"Absolutely fantastic holiday. 2 adults and an 11 year old. A non alcoholic cocktail on arrival was a welcome surprise. The rooms were luxurious and spacious. Each room has a balcony. Although ours looked out over a public footpath, it was a great experience to people watch. The food in the hotel was fantastic and non stop. The location is very central and in a flat location. The staff were really friendly and always keen to help. Each room has a fridge filled with drinks. We are definately thinking of booking next year, as we had a wonderfull holiday. It lived up to everything we wanted it to.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,4,Almost 5 Star...,"Overall this is a lovely place to stay, most of the staff were very friendly (only one person at the pool bar let this down), it's very clean, the gardens are well manicured and the pool area is really beautiful. The food was good and there was always a variety to choose from but it was very much the same every day. This got quite tiring after a week. The room is large and we really liked this as we were travelling with a baby. Everyone was very accommodating and friendly with our baby as well.  Now the downfalls - Our room lost power once and it took multiple calls to reception to arrange to get this fixed. It wouldn't have been a major inconvenience if we were not in the middle of giving our baby dinner. Then it happened again.  The most frustrating thing was people reserving…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,Greatest resort holiday!,"I stayed here in August 2015 with my parents and to be honest, it was probably the best resort holiday I've had! I met many new friends, and had a lot of fun! Due to this fun, I am going to write a massive story of my experiences here! Reception- We arrived at about 1am, but it was only a 30 minute bus drive from the airport (we flew with Thompson). The receptionist was friendly, and the lobby was absolutely huge and well decorated. We had to wait for our room and we ate at the main restaurant, which had a few things even though it was late. Room- When we finally got into the room, my mum (being the fussiest person) checked the toilets and the sheets for any dirt, and was amazed not to find anything. The room we got had 2 single beds put together and one sofa that turned into…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,Again the best hotel in agadir,Last year went 3 times to this hotel and loved it.

 February 2017,4,Great for a relaxing break,"I stayed at the Riu Palace Tikida between 16 February and 23 February and had a wonderfully relaxing break. The entrance is impressive with a vast reception area with lots of comfy sofas and seating areas to choose from. This is also the area for low key entertainment of an evening. We were impressed by the grand piano by the bar expecting a pianist, but actually it was a guy with a keyboard who set up in front of the piano ..... what a shame! This is also the only bar that serves branded drinks. But you have to ask for a Smirnoff or they'll give you the local equivalent. Having said that I had no problem with their substitute brands. They also served coffee and hot chocolate which was great when the weather turned chilly one morning. Reception staff and in fact all the staff…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,Great all inclusive,"This hotel is a very good all inclusive that meets almost all of your needs. The food for breakfast lunch and dinner is fantastic with great variation in the buffet restaurants. For breakfast you can have eggs made to order, pancakes, cereals, bacon and sausage along with yoghurts, fruits and smoothies. There is much coffee and eta as you can drink along with cava if you are feeling fancy! Lunch offers decent variation and the of an evening they have theme nights so you should never get bored. The bookable restaurants are very good and I would highly recommend the Krystal which does a fantastic fillet and chocolate pudding. The drinks flow and the beer is pretty good. The cocktails could do with some work as they often pre mixed and too sweet. The staff are attentive and in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,"Superb All Inclusive hotel of the highest order, amazing food too.","I have found another gem in the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida, Agadir, Morocco. This is a super comfortable and relaxing hotel, sat on the beach and has an amazing pool area. The hotel, all inclusive has the most superb food at breakfast, lunch and dinner and i highly recommend it to anyone wanting a holiday where you have paid for all in advance and can go and enjoy being spoilt 24/7. The staff are wonderful and warm hearted and its been such a pleasurable stay, i will definitely be back very soon. Three hours from Gatwick, same time zone, very reasonable prices and weather perfect. A definite holiday destination.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,Brilliant again!,"5th visit since February 2016 absolutely lovely, rooms very spacious kept spotless bottles of water left in rooms every day fridge stocked with soft drinks too,free safe in rooms can't fault the hotel, food is extremely good, all staff are wonderful nothing to much trouble, especially mileka and redwan in the main restaurant,pool areas is great as are pool staff.The only fault is the animation team just walk about doing nothing, the guy who used to sing in the lobby bar has left and the new singer is not so good.we will certainly be returning later this year as it is so relaxing.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,4,Great staff - shame about the hotel design,This hotel would normally have got a five star rating had it not been for a few annoying factors that all involve noise and the hotel design. Firstly the design of the hotel means that very few rooms have a seaview. Take a walk along the beach promenade and you will see that all other hotels ( also the other RIUs ) have rooms with balconies with direct seaview. Secondly this hotel has very long dark corridors which means that all noises echo and amplify loundly along the whole corridor. Therefore be prepared to be kept awake at night with a hive of activity in the corridor including fighting cats. If you have the added misfortune like we did to have a room near the ice making machines please forget sleep altogether as these machines are so loud when used or when they…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,2nd visit,Me and my boyfriend have recently returned from our second visit to Riu Palace (27th Feb-6th Mar) and again we were not disappointed. The entrance was grand as we remember it and almost immediately you are greeted by helpful staff and a welcome drink. Check in was shift and easy and we were given our room number. Last time we were upgraded to a junior suite which unfortunately didn't happen this time but we had a twin room with a balcony which was more than enough for the both of us. The rooms are extremely spacious and you have your own living room per say. The rooms are clean and the cleaning service do a great job. The staff are all amazing and extremely helpful especially at dinner time. As it was our second visit most of them remembered us and our drinks orders which was…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,1 week in paradise,"Went on a trip for a week with 9 friends golfing and stayed at the RIU Tikida Palace, having stayed at the Agadir Beach previously. All I can say is without doubt one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. Staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Facilities excellent and all inclusive means all inclusive no skimping on anything. Could not recommend highly enough for all types from children upwards. Beautiful pool and spa. Definitely will return next year.!!!!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2017,5,Fantastic holiday - difficult to fault....,"We stayed for a week in one of the junior suites which was fantastic - the room was huge; separate dressing area with 5 wardrobes plus separate toilet and bathroom. Main bedroom very spacious too with sitting area and great outside terrace with both chairs and sun lounges. One of the few hotels where we have stayed with lovely soft bedding and super King comfy beds - we slept so well! The biggest plus point for this hotel is their staff, they were fantastic with guests of all ages. I don't think I've stayed anywhere before where staff have seemed so genuinely engaged with guests; from helping older guests who have fallen asleep in the bar and walking them back to their room safely to the entertainment team who were great with kids - it was lovely to see.

Local wines were good quality and very tasty. Room was of a very high standard, plenty of room, beds were comfy. The room was serviced well everyday the service at the bar and by the pool was first class, good choice of drinks, lovely cocktails. We very much loved the local Moroccan coffee. Gym needs updating with some machines not working.we played volleyball, table tennis and boules. Hotel lobby was very spacious and comfortable. Did not really see much of the evening entertainment. The speciality restaurants were nice but we felt because of the choice and quality of the buffet the local Moroccan restaurant was not worth it.

 February 2017,5,Wonderful Winter escape,"I stayed at RIU PALACE, for 11 nights with my partner from 23rd February. Upon arrival the hotel from the outside looks fab, on entering the reception the same is to be said , it has a wonderful feel of space. We were checked in very swiftly, while waiting we were given a drink. Our room was 4062 overlooking the pool area, near to the lift which was no issue. The room it's self was very large with 2 separate beds , no bother as it was like having a double bed each. There was more than enough space for storage. The bathroom was of a great size. There was a separate area for sitting, the balcony had seats and table. All the facilities at the hotel are really easy to find. The restaurant and main bar area are on level 3 along with reception.

If you tipped the waiters it paid dividends. Pool area generally clean. Gardens lovely. Lunch restaurant good&if u tipped the waiter you would be guarenteed a table outside. Plenty of sunbeds. NEGATIVES: Main foyer sometimes smelt of drains. Staff had to be prompted to replenish food. Both Pools freezing. Sellers on the front are a pain. Dont believe brochure re;branded drinks- had to fight tooth&nail with waiters to get branded drinks. Waiters even lied, laughed&insulted us!

I travelled during half term with my young son and we both enjoyed every aspect of the hotel especially the overall standard and quality of the Hotel and the excellent service from all the staff that we met, nothing was ever too much trouble for any of them and they certainly made you feel like a valued client. The rooms are extremely spacious with sofa areas,large bathrooms, the mini bar replenished daily and the standard of daily cleaning excellent.

The hotel was well laid out with two large pools outside one was heated so a bit busy the other was very cold did not use the indoor pool but it looked o.k.

 March 2017,5,Growler,Have just returned from the Riu Palace this was our 5th time here. As all previous visits it was first class from the fantastic staff the food and drink the cleanliness absolutely brilliant and we will return again hopefully soon. The only negative was the sun bed towel fiasco . On arrival you are issued with a card for a sun bed towel which is a good idea the towel is returned each day and the next day you get a clean one. This is now not possible as we noticed a large majority of holidaymakers had two or three towels so that when we went for a clean towel there was none available we had the same towel for 3 days. Mr.Manager how is this fair how do guests have the ability to have more than one towel. On our previous holidays we were able to change our towel daily. What has…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,Working Visit,"Not a bad place to stay for 3 nights, while visiting customers and meetings. The room was very spacious with a very large double bed, lounge area and balcony, Good shower with strong pressure and always hot. With being all inclusive the breakfast and evening meals offered every option you could want and the bar area was always busy and enjoyable. I didn't get the chance to test the pool area but it looked great with plenty of different seating or lounging areas. The beach and sea front was only a few yards away and again looked very inviting if I had more time. Over all a very enjoyable short stay and will look forward to returning in the future.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 February 2017,5,A Wonderful Place,We had upgraded to a suite and was allocated 4121 - We have never stayed in anywhere as huge. As usual for a Riu Palace the hotel was excellent with fantastic facilities and marvellous food. As well as eating in the 'main' restaurant we also trid the 2 speciality restaurants as well The Morrocan and Krystal were both fantastic. The location of the hotel being right on the main promenade could not be bettered and even though my wife is in a wheelchair it was really nice to walk along the promenade. Plenty of hawkers but they all took a no thank you without problems. Nice to see the police and army patrols along the promenade so we felt really secure.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

At night and first thing in the morning it can be slightly nippy and you may need a light jacket or jumper. The hotel is amazing when you drive up with the check in service being speedy and efficient. Our room wasn't quite ready therefore we were quite happy to go and sit outside in the sunshine and sample some of the beverages from the bar. Our room was near the end of the long corridor on Floor 3, which is actually the same floor level as the reception. The walk was certainly worth it and we were blown away by the size of the room. There is a massive king size bed and then down a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,5* Moroccan Honeymoon,"This was our honeymoon hotel! We arrived May 2015 and were instantly greeted with champagne on arrival and checked into our exuberant hotel room. We had a choice of 5 restaurants on our all inclusive basis, so sampled each one; enjoying Moroccan cuisine, fine wines and 5* service. The weather was not amazing, as Moroccan climate means that mornings are quite overcast and foggy, but then come midday, the sun appears from nowhere and everyone soaks it up. We tried camel riding, a tour of Agadir and visited the top of the Kasbah. I'll never forget this holiday!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,4,Another great stay,"Recently returned from the Palace and can't wait to return. This hotel is ideal for a winter holiday, it's not the sort of resort you'd go in the height of Summer, but it's luxury and value are perfect this time of year. The rooms are modern and well equipped, with everything you'd expect in a luxury hotel (except luxury toiletries) the WiFi in the rooms can be achieved with a cheap travel router/repeater, the firm mattress cured by a hotel supplied topper. If you need a Queen size bed, you can request one on booking, they usually give them to married couples. This hotels employees, like the ever smiling lifeguard Medhi and the animations Abs and hey Arnold are truly assets to this hotel. Only the hardest to please in life would be disappointed in the Palace for value and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,'Palace' it certainly is,"I've stayed in some very good Riu 4* Hotels so I was looking forward to visiting the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. I was certainly not disappointed. From the moment you enter the vast lobby area you can not fail to be impressed. Check in was fast and efficient and we were soon in our room and what a room it was. Large was an understatement, we'd paid for a 'junior suite' lord knows what a full suite is like because this room was huge and spotlessly clean. Massive bedroom area, large dressing area with plenty of storage space, 2 sink bathroom with bath/shower and separate walk in shower, large balcony with table and chairs also two sunloungers. The impressive bedroom was just an example of things to come. Fabulous pool area with choice of loungers and plenty of room, great bar and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,5,"Fantastic stay, wonderful staff, exquisite food.","Visited for a rest and relaxation holiday. Got exactly that, even at the end of January it was warm enough and the pool was great. Our room was lovely bathroom was a good size for a family of 3, with a nice balcony for us to enjoy the evening. Disappointed that you were not allowed alcohol back in the room, as we had a 3 year old we could not stay out to enjoy the evening in the bar. Good size beds too however they were a little hard, this is the only negative thing about our stay. Breakfasts were spot, the choice was fantastic the same for lunch and dinners. It was great to try the different local foods on offer. Entertainment throught the day was brilliant with different clubs and events to keep you busy if you wanted to. All the staff were brilliant. My wife needed to get…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,WOW,"From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we could not find fault with this hotel. We had a junior suite which was lovely very spacious. Mini bar stocked daily with beer, water and soft drinks. Tea & coffee provided. The food is excellent. The crystal restaurant is very good with such good service. Moroccan restaurant just as good and the buffet is probably one ohf the nicest buffets we have come across on our travels. They had everything you could want - fresh fish cooked while u wait, lovely roast meats the pork was so tender, vegetables were varied. If sweet is not your thing there was a good selection of cheese. Breakfast buffet excellent. We had no trouble sitting around the pool, the attendants at the pool would find beds for you and place them wherever you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,Breathtaking,"Just returned from an amazing holiday with my boyfriend. When we arrived at the hotel we were blown away by the luxurious detail, grand lobby area, friendly and welcoming staff (with a cocktail on arrival awaiting checkin). The staff are fantastic, nothing is too much for them - and no, they do not expect tips! The room was out of this world, large balcony, seating area, massive bed (two together), bathroom area massive and clean. Fridge refilled daily (soft drinks). Only downside would be the Beds - separate and make a lot of noise when you are 'together'. Food is out of this world - recommend the Moroccan Theme restaurant. We tried both but this was our favourite. Even in buffet food areas, the food was great. No complaints at all! There is NOTHING to Fault about…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2017,5,Our eighth stay and still amazing,Just returned from another holiday at this wonderful hotel. We think it is amazing and we love everything about it. The service we receive from all the staff in the hotel is exceptional. The waiters in the restaurants and in the bars are friendly and make sure you are so well looked after on every day of your stay. The range and quality of food continues to amaze us. We love visiting the themed restaurants like the Krystal and the Marrakech where again the standard of food and quality of service are as high as ever. The staff on Reception are friendly and welcoming on arrival. They are always there to help and do an amazing job.

 February 2017,5,Fifty shades of brown......,"Some reviewers have commented on how drab and gloomy this hotel is. Yes, it is very brown but the furnishings and fittings are all high quality. It has a luxurious feel with lots of reflective surfaces and many lovely sitting areas featuring interesting object d'art. The overall atmosphere is relaxing and the drink measures are lethal! The service is top notch. We asked for a wifi cable for the room and we were given one immediately but it was only suitable for a lap top. We didn't like the restaurant seating very much. There are very few tables for two so you could find yourselves sitting next to strangers - or it could be said new friends! Tried the Krystal restaurant but it must have been chef's night off. Quick tip...Our bath took an age to fill until another guest…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Christmas Gala Dinner and New Year Gala Dinner was fantastic, such a good time had by all. The food at this hotel is to a high standard and although we stayed for nine weeks we could not fault any of it and we managed to eat in a manner that it did not become repetitive. This is one of the friendliest hotels we have ever stayed at and even after such a long stay we found it so relaxing and enjoyable we would consider doing the same again or even longer would not be a problem.

 October 2016,1,Disappointed,"We were forced by Thomson to pay for a sea view suite as they said that there was nothing else available as we were booking late. We arrived at the hotel quite late. We were told where our room was and made our way there. The room stunk when we opened the door. It had clearly not been used or aired in preparation for guests. There was no water in the room, robe was missing, mattresses' for loungers were missing, bidet was blocked the whole time we were there and several lights didn't work. We went back to reception and was told to go and get our own water from the bar. They didn't bother with any of the other problems. We mentioned the problems to the rep, who managed to get the robe situation sorted out after 4 days, but none of the repairs were carried out and the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

When we first got to agadir the first 10 minutes of coach transfer was a sad look of whats going on in the world, as it was very ran down and less fortunate people, away from that once we entered the resort and saw the hotel in real life my first thoughts WOW! what a beautiful hotel, luxury style rooms with plenty on offer around the hotel from spa's to swimming pools! They have great outdoor pools and a nice warm indoor one! Plenty of pretty places to sit around and soak up the beautiful weather!

 January 2017,5,Where 'All Inclusive' means 'All Inclusive'.,"I have just returned from a 3 week stay at the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. Where to start with a review of this hotel ? I guess I’ll get the cons out of the way first. Don’t bother asking reception for help with anything. They really are totally useless. The entertainment; In the UK we have something called the ‘Trade Descriptions Act’. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 is an Act of the Parliament which prevents service industry providers from misleading consumers as to what they are spending their money on. Let me tell you, they would never get away with calling their diabolical disarray of badly put together spectacles of travesty ‘entertainment’ in this country. In addition why on earth they need to do a pre show display right outside the dining room some nights, thereby ruining…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2017,5,"Wow! Excellent staff, Excellent hospitality, Excellent Quality.","Working as General Manager of hotels in Liverpool, UK - I was genuinely blown away by the experience in the Riu Palace in January. Both myself and my friends couldn't have faulted the service of the staff - from the moment we reached the hotel to moment we left. Service with a smile goes a long way in my opinion and I have to say that ALL the staff truly portrayed that. The animation team were fantastic by the pool area - making an effort to see to all guests (from older guests to the youngest kids). Anass was truly exceptional in his job role along with Abdo who made the evening entertainment something you didn't want to miss. These member of the team are true assets your company and should be praised for their excellent commitment and service. The food and drinks were of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2017,5,"Will return, incredibly friendly and great for our baby with allergies!","In case I write a long review, here is the summary : We loved it, will definitely return and having a toddler with two major allergies they handled it so very very well. The transfer from the airport is about 30 minutes, they have at least 5 or 6 people to check you in when you arrive. I left my bag of ipads, phones, cameras, medicine etc... on the transfer coach. The hotel reception helped co-ordinate its return that evening. The room, called a twin was actually one huge bed, with a cot in it. We had plenty of wardrobe space, a lounge area, a loo and bidet and a shower over the bath, twin sinks. A mini bar, a cot and a balcony with two chairs.

We are greeted with a lovely ‘Welcome back’ and handshakes on arrival, even though we were troublesome last year, wanting a change of room from shade to sunshine. The poor porter was exhausted from carrying our luggage from room to room. The emphasis is on customer satisfaction and comfort in every area. The buildings, rooms and gardens are immaculately kept and the food is not just a beautifully presented feast on the eyes, but delicious, with something on offer for every palate.

Restaurant staff very attentive, closely monitored by Deputy Manager. Khadija and Redouane particularly attentive. Spa experience good. The food was plentiful and diverse, especially fish at lunchtime. Bacon was plentiful at breakfast as was the Prosecco! Although the hotel was busy there was always plenty of staff.

 January 2017,5,What's not to like?,"Two of us have just returned from a week's stay in this hotel. This was our first visit to Agadir. Excellent experience. The staff were very friendly and they could not do enough for us. The hotel room we stayed in was clean, very spacious with A/C, free minibar and a safe that is free to use. One very minor criticism is that the wi fi only works in the lobby area and the buffet restaurant where lunch is served. But that did not put us off. Lots of sunbeds around the pool area, However, as in anywhere you go on holiday these days, a lot of them are ""reserved"" using hotel provided towels. There is a private beach but we did not use it due to the wind. I guess it will be different in summertime. Food is splendid with lots of choices and varieties.

My husband and I can honestly say that Riu Palace Tikida in Agadir has been the only hotel that ticks all the boxes. From the moment we were checked in by a smiling receptionist to one of the directors waving us off after our weeks stay, the middle bit in between was a delight. The room was spacious, clean, with a good sized balcony. We slept very well in the huge bed which is a massive box ticked!

The only thing for myself and my husband which prevented us from saying we would return was the food quality, we found this to be quite repetitive and lacking.

The food at this particular hotel was spot on, however having stayed at the Club hotel in Gran Canaria earlier in the year the food wasn't as vast and the drinks weren't as good either. However I have no idea why people complain about service, we didn't tip and there was never a wait at the bars or restaurants. The staff were all so happy and friendly. We didn't have the best of weather every day but it was still warm and you could put this hotel on any beach front. Be warned though, Agadir lacks anywhere to explore so you could be easily on the Costa Del Sol here. We just prefer sights…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Reception offered a different room on same side which smelt equally bad. Apparently that is just how the rooms smell. Waiters occassionally grabbed my 4 year old from me and kissed her (complete strangers to her). One waiter was offended by me taking her back from him that he refused to serve our table! Other waiters and waitresses had variable degrees of service mindedness - for example I was removed from my seat so another person could sit at the table (even though there were lots of other tables free). Our rose was taken from our table and given to someone else. Most staff were friendly and appropriate, however. Wifi in the rooms was available (could see the room numbers…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Important to know that the hotel is u-shaped and one side is in the shade, cool for the hot summer months, but not so nice in winter. I recommend to check your wing's side when booking according to the season. Best rooms are on 4th floor, they are more quiet.

Because we waited in the room for someone to come we missed out on our evening meal and when we told reception this, they didnt even offer a sandwich (24 hour all inclusive...Not) Wifi is not in the rooms as it states online.

The facilities have aged and started to show its wear and tear in the rooms and corridor's. I think the hotel has made cutbacks because in the evenings the branded drinks run out around 10.00pm. I said in a review in 2012 that they continually ran out of Smirnoff Vodka and Baileys in the evenings, they still do. The amount of stock in the fridges have reduced to two cans of coke, sprite, fanta no beers anymore. The food was good, good selection at their buffet.

From the reaction we saw to many guests and staff they must have been returning guests, which must be a good sign. It's a very large hotel, two a la carte restaurants Krystal and Marrakech and a buffet style restaurants we themed nights. Krystal was a fusion restaurant there was a small choice, the food quality was very good, it just didn't seem to hit the mark, not well balanced. One main course was duck breast with plantain in a cherry sauce it just seemed a little bizarre ! I preferred the Marrakech restaurant traditional food.

 December 2016,5,Fabulous Christmas week,"We travelled to Agadir for Christmas in the sun, and Riu Palace was fabulous. Stunning hotel, great food, lovely staff. The only negative is that the hotel was built specifically for the hot climate.. eg all corridors around the hotel are exposed to the weather, which I'm sure is fabulous when it's hot, however in the winter when it's chilly at night you definitely need to wrap up when walking around the hotel to the dining room, and in the experience restaurants where we sat with our coats on!! We were disappointed on arrival as we couldn't get into our rooms until 90 minutes after check-in time as the Hotel had allowed too many check-out guests to stay on in their rooms.

I would suggest asking or booking a pool view, there is a very limited amount on sea views. The pool area was beautiful, prob one of the cleanses and best I've seen in all inclusive. The pool team were nice and friendly and the water aerobics was very good. The spa treatment was also very lovely and reasonable priced. The steam room was lush.

 January 2017,5,fantastic,"Second visit to palace hotel. Staff amazing and attentive always offering a smile and service excellent. Food as always superb, very varied even for my fussy eating. cannot understand other reviewers who say you must tip to get good service, never found this as we tipped at end of our 10 day holiday. weather was very good around 22 centigrade each day so sun bathing top priority. Only complaints. The usual towel on bed reservists every morning, although against hotel rules!!! and also the shows do not start until 9.30 a little late for some people",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Whole experience was fabulous Hotel spotlessly clean -- Food and drink plentiful and varied -- staff cheerful , always smiling-- weather perfect Cool enough for an early morning /evening stroll and warm enough to relax on the very comfortable loungers during the rest of the day. Our room 3005 had partial sea view but got no sun so was quite dark If any criticism I would say that sockets were not placed in a way that was conduisive to hair drying and styling if ladies were to bring their own drier .and there was anly one socket beside the bed for phone chargerf etc Thomson rep Hassan very helpful and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2016,5,The best hotel in Agadir!,"My wife and I stay at the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir for Christmas, definitely the best choice ever made for a relax week with sunshine, sand, sea and dromedary ride! It's a real five star all the way...what I love the most it's in the all inclusive service, you order a glass of wine and they give you the whole bottle!! that's real all inclusive!!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2017,5,An all inclusive that really is.,"Choosing a fantastic time to escape from England to avoid the threatened floods and snow, we touched down to 70* temperatures in Agadir a week last Monday. These temperatures were sustained and increased all the following week. A 35 minute coach ride from the outskirts deposited us outside the imposing entrance of the Riu Palace Tikida Hotel. Staff were on hand to carry the cases and offer us a fruit juice welcome and we were swiftly processed by the pleasant and numerous reception staff. Directed to the poolside restaurant for a very wide choice of hot and cold food, washed down with copious amounts of wine and/or water, we satisfied our immediate appetites before collecting our room key and a porter to steer the luggage. A welcoming, large room with sitting area and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2017,5,Your in for an amazing stay (Detailed Review),"From the moment we walked into the Riu Palace we knew we were in for a great stay. Its a very new and well maintained hotel. Two words that don’t usually tally with All Inclusive Resort. This feels like Hotel than a resort. ""Branded Drinks in a 24/7 piano bar!"" (That one line sums up how great this place is!) For one, branded drinks. This is something thats so unheard of at most resorts. The second is that its all inclusive 24/7. Again, a rarity. No rushing to order 3 Mojitos at midnight! Okay, so far it sounds like I am a drunk but thats not the point. For me, All Inclusive should mean just that. No cut offs, restrictions, service dead-zones and supplements. You want to be able to holiday just the way you want to and not feel like there are restrictions to your enjoyment. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2017,5,Another great New Year,"We travelled to this hotel, on the 29th Dec. We were greated as usual from all the lovely reception staff. Our room, was not ready, so we went for a drink in the bar. When we eventually went to our room, it was lovely, clean and spacious. The hotel is very well run, the food superb, and so much varniety, and all the staff, no - matter where they work, or what they do, are always polite and very friendly. This hotel is a credit to all the staff, whatever they do, from management to the other end, the hotel runs so well, it's a fantastic place for a holiday. Would recommend this hotel, for families, couples etc. If you want to enjoy a good holiday, with good weather, this us the place.😌. Sun, sea and good food and wine. Xxxx",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2016,5,Excellent place to stay,"We have chosen this hotel as emergency when it was not possible to go to Marsa Alam (Egypt) due to the lack of places in the aircraft. So to say hotel is excellent, it cares about guests, provides very outstanding service including food, bar, plenty of drinks to chose from, e.g. 4 whiskies (scotch JW, Grants etc) and Jack Daniels, selections of real coffees, not the instant ones, like cappuccino, late, Americano, Moroccan, and many other kinds one may wish, also by the pool. Food was just excessive many kinds of fishes, meats, sea food and many more. Just impossible to try everything. Christmas Eve dinners was even more special.

 January 2017,4,Disappointed with the Rui brand,"We stayed here for a week in January and although the location was ideal for a short winter break just a few hours away from the UK, we expected more from a Palace, being the luxury end of the Rui brand. We generally visit the Caribbean for AI and the luxury level is a lot higher. It may be that the standard this side of the pond is lower and we were expecting too much. The only AI we have stayed at this side has been 2 standard Rui and this Palce. We didn't like the level of the standards and found them to be 3 star at best. Our expectations this time were a lot higher but although it was a step up in many ways certain Rui trates remained. We still had a very enjoyable holiday and would return again if the price was right but in all honesty I would give the hotel a low 4 star…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2017,5,"Great, loved this trip!","Riu Tikida Palace is located well in Agadir, right on the promenade, directly across from the beach. There were one or two niggles, but honestly for the price paid these are pretty insignificant in the bigger picture. Room was large, well equipped, we could pick up the wifi from the lobby on our balcony which was great, clean and well maintained - the mini bar has soft drinks only and there is a safe in the room. We used the bottled water to brush our teeth which was helpful. TV worked well could pick up sky news which has been interesting with lots of Trump coverage! The hotel itself is large, well maintained and the grounds are beautiful. Theres two outdoor pools and an indoor pool, one of which is heated - which was handy in January!

 November 2016,3,9th stay in this hotel was disappointing,"My family and I went for the 9th time to this hotel for our regular golf holiday. It was really a disappointment compared with previous stays. Management is cutting down on quality and resources (staff). Furniture and rooms are only 5 years old but should be renewed urgently. Overall not that bad but I would rather rate 4* instead of 5*. This is really a pitty because in the past, we enjoyed a marvellous all-incluse holiday for 8 (eight) times in 2012 - 2016.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It has been renovated and the rooms and lobby look very classy indeed, Wifi service has been added, so you can use the internet in your room. A very large breakfast and lunch restaurant was built with a view of the sea. The staff are so friendly and provide excellent service. All inclusive means all inclusive and you get two litres of water delivered to your room and the safe is also part of the all inclusive deal. Breakfast includes western breaksfast, local specialities which are worth trying,Lunch is equally tempting with a pasta section, pizza, an ernormous salad bar, couscous and tajine and of course the most Amazing desserts.

 December 2016,3,Not as good as it used to be,"Have been to this hotel many times with my husband. We are both quite lively pensioners. The facilities are not so good. Toilets with hand driers that dont work. Toilets closed in lounge to save on cleaning. Four open instead of seven. Drinks not so good, food not so hot. Am taking a break from Riu Palace and going to Robinson Club this time. Staff are still excellent although we had our towels taken in the morning and it was late afternoon before we had replacements. Little things, but it has certainly deteriorated.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2017,5,Excellent Well Managed Hotel,We visited this hotel not really expecting too much as it was very reasonably priced but we come just to fill a week with some sun. The whole week here was a very pleasant surprise. The check in was a bit unorganised which didn't create the best first impression and initially our room smelt of sewage. After these problems were sorted the overall experience was very good. The rooms are really spacious and nicely furnished. Beds are a bit hard like the old Riu beds used to be. The duvets on the beds are really cosy and the bed linen is really nice quality. We found the room a bit stuffy at night and the aircon is centrally controlled and only turned on in the summer months. I think most people however would find the room a comfortable temperature. The food in the hotel is…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2016,5,One of the best hotels I've stayed in!!,"We stayed in this hotel in December for 9 nights and it was honestly one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world. The standards were high. The food was excellent quality and abundant. It is often very difficult to maintain a high standard with food in buffets as there is so much waste but all the meals at this hotel were first quality, nothing ever reheated or stored for the next meal. Even my 5 year old who is a very fussy eater was lost for choice. The staff were extremely polite, courteous and helpful and would go beyond the call of duty to help out. The rooms are very spacious, clean, well equipped and very comfortable. The only downside I could find in this hotel is that there is no internet inside the rooms,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2016,5,65th Birthday Celebration,"My husband had booked for me a surprise birthday present,which was the holiday to this fine hotel.

I spoke to one of the reps to make sure it was ready,and was told as my birthday is not on the day,I couldn't have it.as my birthday was in August. My birthday is 29th October . I was not satisfied with this so made a complaint at redemption,told them what had happened they said leave it to them. Well we went for our meal,the table was laid out for us,they couldn't do enough for me. We had champagne,wine and rose petals on table.

 January 2017,5,Brilliant!,"Returned home from this hotel a few days ago...I must say I was pleasantly surprised! We travelled independently booking our own flight and the hotel ourselves. I've stayed in many Riu hotels and I must say the staff are some of the best I've seen in any hotel! We loved the food especially at the krystal restaurant but I even found the buffet really good! The only thing which I think needs improvement is the gym, the equipment is not very good and one treadmill was broke for the whole week we were there! We will definitely return!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

When we arrived at the airport be prepared for people to take your cases to the coach and they will want tipping!! We had to give them English money as we only had large dirham notes. I would also recommend taking a pen so you can fill in the papers you need to get into the country. When we arrived we were welcomed with drinks and the porters took our bags to our room. The restaurant was also still open for food which was good, as the transfer and getting out of the airport took ages.

The reception really looks great at night along with all the hallways and corridors all lit up with lamps etc. First impressions were good although a bit of an unorganised jumble at reception to check in. Problems with our room initially because of a smell of sewage although this was sorted out after a while. This was a bit of a disappointment for a 5 star hotel. Reception staff are in general trying to be as helpful as they can be...although need to be trained that when an error occurs that is the hotels fault then the guest/customer should be inconvenienced as little as possible with any outcome being at the hotels expense.

 January 2017,5,A return visit.,"We visited this hotel in February 2016 and were so impressed that for the first time ever we vowed to return. I'm writing this as we're approaching the end of another excellent week here. The standards haven't dropped, in fact I think they have improved! There really isn't much more to add than what's been said in the other recents reviews. Regarding the wifi, there's no wifi in the room so I purchased a T-P Link from Amazon for £15 and plugged it in to the Ethernet socket on the wall switched it on and we instantly had wifi in the room and all three of us could use our phones etc at the same time.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2016,5,Better than expectations,"We visited in December on a Black Friday deal. The hotel was immaculate and constantly being cleaned and not at all shoddy. The rooms were large like junior suites with marble bathrooms and instant hot water - we overlooked the street on the south east side so got the sun all day, and the balconies were a decent size with new furniture. The only disappointment was that the pillows were hard and when we asked for soft ones, they brought more hard ones.Wifi was only available in public areas. There was a good choice of food, and one could find a corner away from the zoo of people in the dining rooms or outside. The waiters were very attentative and we never had to wait very long.

She was able to access all areas and we had a lovely room (1006) next to the restaurant,pool bar and adjacent to the spacious promenade. As previous reviewers have commented, the food is always plentiful and fresh. We ate twice at the Krystal which I can highly recommend. The majority of staff are excellent.

The hotel is very much worth the money, but has previous reviews have stated in some areas the hotel is a little tired and could do with some sprucing up. Upon entering the hotel you are greeted with welcome drinks, perfect for everyone as they're light a refreshing. I think coconut was the main element of it. It's a bit crowded at the check-in desk, so just wait for the queues to die down. There are bell boys who take your bags to your room so the first process of the check-in is pretty much a breeze.

Each one of them had time to acknowledge you while carrying out their job to the highest level. Everyone seemed to enjoy working there. The food throughout was tremendous, the majority being freshly cooked by an array of competent yet friendly chefs. Christmas Eve was verging on Michelin star food!

After being ill, and my lesson learnt, I avoided all salad, cold food, and ice in my drinks only to be ill again. I can't figure out what it was that made me ill but we spoke to three other couples who were also ill the week we were there. My only guess is maybe there was something in the swimming pool water? Maybe the orange juice was watered down, or maybe there was a bug in the pool or in the bar drinks? My other half was not ill. He has a better stomach than me and drank more booze!

They set up the sofa bed with a blanket for my son but we asked for a duvet which was no problem at all. Next time, I will take an extension lead because the plugs are quite far from the mirrors when drying/straightening your hair. Food: the food was absolutely fantastic.

 November 2016,5,Amazing,"I would highly recommend this hotel! Myself and a friend went in November. The first day was let down by the weather but we had plenty to keep us occupied in the hotel. The hotel itself is spectacular, with grand modern decoration and facilities. The pool bar was great for when we need a break from the sun, there is even the option of the beach to catch the rays too! The animation team kept us well entertained in the evenings with different types of shows to see. We didn't struggle for choice at meal times, as there was more than enough variety of food at a very good standard. It should be rated a 7 star resort in our opinion!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2016,5,This truly beautiful Palace has made our holiday dreams a reality.,"We are thankful to the wonderful trip advisor community for the recommendations for this hotel. This aided us in our decision to come to Agadir, Morocco for our family beach holiday. The all inclusive option and direct flights also helped to inspire us. Riu's Tikida Palace Hotel is located in a safe and quiet area. It is a beachfront hotel. You may access the beach easily by crossing the promenade and there is a private area with chairs for hotel guests only. I cannot say enough good things about the hotel. The service has been excellent from the moment we walked through the doors. Everyone has done their utmost to deliver an unforgettable holiday experience. There are an abundance of lounge chairs, towels, and attentive staff everywhere to make sure you have everything required…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2016,5,Fantastic,"Booked this hotel for a week for 2 on a all inclusive deal through Thomson. All I can say.... fantastic. Because I have been to Agadir many times over several years and I always stay in 5 star hotels or luxury style apartments in the marina. I have never experienced the flair and luxury like this when I came to Riu Tikida Palace. When you arrive, you are greeted with a cocktail drink and the check in is so smooth and all the staff are happy and pleased to welcome you. I try to be careful about making positive reviews because once you read them, public with book this hotel and this drives the prices up but to be honest this hotel deserves the praise. Over 4 restaurants but we only tried two and these we were more than happy. Brilliant display and variety of food. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It was our first holiday together so we made sure to read all the reviews and about the hotel before booking! On arrival it was just how it looked in the photos, everywhere was beautifully done! The rooms were amazing, a bit disappointing they were twin beds but we managed to work with it. They were very big and spacious and the bathrooms were lovely! The food was amazing, my boyfriend all in all had around 6 meals a day and never had any complaints as the food was varied and really nice. The pool area is beautiful, they have a swim up bar which is nice but not always manned so you have to try and get someones attentions.

 December 2016,4,Should be 5 stars but some niggles,"This is a fabulous hotel in prime position by the beach. The public areas, especially the gardens, are pristine. The staff were very welcoming and worked so hard to give us a lovely relaxing holiday. Just a few niggles though. The bedroom was looking a little tired and the mugs were in very poor condition (as has been mentioned by others) and the evening shows were dire.

 December 2016,5,Great winter break / Amazing Hotel,"Just returned from a week at the RIU Palace. What a great hotel! Staff - Staff are the best part of this hotel, everyone is friendly and helpful. I've never been to a hotel where each member of staff has a smile on there face. Hotel - Rooms are clean and spacious I upgraded to get a pool view which was well worth it. There is a main bar area where everyone congregates in the evening which normally has piano music playing. There is also a ATM on site. There is a shop on site which mainly sells souvenirs. They do sell toiletries but they wanted £7 for a tin of Gillette shaving cream & £5 for baby wipes. So it was really expensive. There are several shop across the road from the hotel they should be much cheaper. Food & Drink - the bars have a choice of about 8 cocktails,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2016,5,Really is 5 star,"At the time of writing we are staying at this hotel for the first week of our 6 week Morocco trip. Decided to start with some luxury before we backpack around morocco and this hotel has exceeded our expectations. We booked 2 rooms and both are spacious and luxurious more like suites than bedrooms. Despite reading about being bothered by staff we have experienced nothing but professionality, friendliness and a desire to help. Hotel is modern, immaculately clean and food choice is superb. Best suited to couples/friends/adults. Right by the sea and corniche and only a couple of euros into agadir centre if desired. Indoor swimming pool is gorgeous. If all-inclusive is your thing I couldn't fault this place.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Still our favorite,"The RIU Tikida Palace is a fine hotel which has welcomed us 4 times now. The pool area is beautiful as is the reception & bar, and the service is, in the main, excellent and most friendly. Although English is the 3rd language (at least) for many of the staff there is no trouble with communication at any time. The rooms are well appointed and now have more English speaking TV (if you want to watch) than before. We find the buffet restaurants to be the best of any RIU we have visited and the Krystal a la carte is lovely, despite it's limited menu. The Moroccan restaurant has changed. Bigger portions of overly sweetened food meant it was not really to our taste any more. Also be warned about the swim-up bar - it's in the pool without any heating! Some positive changes to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2016,5,We will be back,"Booked this holiday as a cheap get away as w needed a break. Was not sure what to expect as we usually travel a lot further for holidays (Asia/Mexico/America) but we loved it. The entertainment staff were fabulous and friendly. They aren't pushy, all week we only joined in bingo as I was very sick for a few days and was very weak but there was lots on offer and a fitness program as well! Had I been feeling good I would have fully taken advantage of all the activities on offer. Shout out to Afro square man, your lush & a great dancer! Food was amazing.

The staff would help if needed. The heated pool, was bearable, the cold pool wasn't! The indoor pool, was tepid at best, but good for a swim on the wet days. We only used the buffet restaurants.

Drinks available 24/7 at the price we paid I think it was well worth it. Weather was nice and this is December. Hotel was very busy but staff catered very well.

We were on the third floor facing the pool and I have no complaints about noise. The service in the restaurants was great and the drinks selection was good.

The only two downsides (if you can call them that!), is that there is no WiFi in the hotel rooms, only an ethernet cable. The WiFi is only available in the common areas and even then, it can't be reached at the far end of the pool near the beach. The second minor issue we had was with trying to change currency at the hotel desk. We'd changed a little upon arriving at the airport, but then needed a little more and the hotel didn't have enough MAD to give us (this was less than 300GBP between us). Then on checking out of the hotel, we needed to change our money back, but were told that they only had 60GBP...

We had requested two adjoining rooms which we were given, I had also requested a ground floor room close to the amenities as we were travelling with my old parents with limited mobility.

Now it’s a bit of a mixed review to be honest as this would have been a glowing 5 star review had it not been for one flaw, my husband got severe food poisoning and was in bed / toilet for 2 days after a burger at lunch 2/3 of the way through the holiday. Obviously this is a huge deal and as frequent holiday makers we know what to avoid and what to do to avoid getting a dodgy tummy on holiday but this was unfortunate. The food despite this was amazing, I loved the fact there was always a section of Moroccan food available at each meal. There were plenty of snacks available all day at some point through the hotel.

No big deal although he told people that you needed to contact him a couple of days before leaving to get an exit visa form. I’ll try and keep it brief and focused on my review with as little waffle as I can. The check-in process at reception was smooth and efficient although it’s the first time I have had to stand up and queue holding my arrival cocktail rather than be sat down.

The hotel is very nice overall, however it's beginning to show signs of wear and tear in the room. We found that the service, food and drinks were not quite as good as our last visit. This was another reminder about why we don't normally visit the same place twice. This hotel is still one of the better ones in the area and it's a nice base to be in when staying in Agadir. I would recommend it if you get it at a good deal.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Once you get through the airport in Agidir and past their surly staff, you are greeted by very friendly people and this continued throughout our week's stay. On arrival at the hotel the first impression was ""Wow!"". It is absolutely stunning. We were given glasses of an ice-cold fruit drink before checking in. Very welcome! Check in was a bit chaotic but this was more a fault of Thomson's than the hotel's. We were a party of 10 and Thomson's had the wrong names down as sharing rooms.

Some staff not really intetested this also included senior management. This is taking customers for granted obviously thinking these things dont matter amymore Its gone down hill in my opinion. Not a 5 star now",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Great value for money .,I went with a party of 10 family and friends i asked everyone if they had any complaints about the hotel they all said no. We all said the food was great rooms clean and the staff friendly i think it all depends how you treat them yes they do like a tip. Just a heads up we had an early flight so when we got there some of the rooms weren't ready but to be fair to them it does say at reception check out by eleven and check in at three your travel company should make that clear. It is expensive outside of the hotel i went across the road for a lilo he started off at £30.00 i got him down to £25.00 and then give up . If you go into a bar or restaurant always ask the price for a beer because it's not cheap and it can vary greatly beware. Yes we will be going back and the weather…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here for a week in the middle of June 2016, (this year). I spent a long time choosing a hotel but I definately made the right choice Rooms...were large and well planned out. They were clean and the in room fridge provided bottled water and I think carbonated drinks. Tea and coffee making facilities and the usual hair dryer etc. Dinning..you could book for Italian or Moroccan resturants for a change but we ate in the ordinary restaurant. The food was good for an all inc hotel. Staff were wonderful. They served drinks and certainly didn t stint. The lunch time restaurant is a bit chaotic but again there is a fair choice of dishes Pool area...this area was very large and attractive. There were plenty of loungers and day beds. Poolside bars for drinks during the day…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,2,"Rude staff, Dirty rooms","We have just got back from a weeks stay at this hotel. Very dissapointed at this supposed 5 star hotel. No greeting on arrival due to being last in from the coach. Had to ask for a drink. They should know how many people are arriving therefore have the correct number of drinks. Check in process was easy, however no information was provided about dinner etc and no map of the hotel site was provided. Very dark corridors took us to our rooms which took some time to find with no clear instruction as where to go. The rooms are big but very dull, on opening the wardrobes we found ants covering the tea area and in our kettle. Spoke to reception and asked for a differnt kettle but it wasnt changed. They sent someone down with insect spray instead. Whilst he sprayed this my 3 yrold…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,3,Nice Hotel - Beware of Food Poisoning,"Just returned from a week at the Riu Palace. Nice hotel, can't really add any more than has already been said but my boyfriend and I have become extremely ill with food poisoning. I wont go in to details but I lost 6lb in the space of 10 hours (I weigh about 9st 10lb (or did do)) and have not been able to get out of bed for 2 days. I am 100% certain it is from the grilled chicken we ate for lunch on our last day (Thursday). After I ate the chicken I noticed that the person who was cooking the chicken was using the same tongs for the raw chicken as he used to move the cooked chicken on to guests plates. I notice this has been reported on tripadvisor previously and It would be interesting to know how many other guest have become ill ? Great for a post holiday diet, not so great…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,4,5 years getting tired,"We have visited this hotel probably 7 times and so have seen it from very new to today Returned home on Thursday and for the first time ever we've both had travellers tummy. Having stayed here so many times we are scrupulous about our hygiene so not sure what has changed In terms of the rest of the holiday a fantastic value for money holiday but standards are starting to slip such as poor quality spirits, very little drinks service around the pool. Fab staff great food and friendly atmosphere though and once I forget the tt we'll probably book again",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Paradise,"Our first impression of this hotel was wow. This continued throughout our stay. The whole hotel area was kept spotless with many areas tucked away where you could sit quietly. The food was varied and imaginative and the drinks including the wines very good. What stood out were the staff, everyone was friendy, helpful for and the service they gave was exceptional. At meals they brought your tea, coffee and fruit juice to your table and for lunch and evening meal your requested wine, water and soft drinks were brought to your table in the bottle together with an ice bucket. Your glass was topped up when it was getting low. The pool area was lovely. There were 2 pools, one quite warm and the other one a bit cooler. Towels were often put on the loungers early but it wasn't a problem…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Relaxing,"This is an unspoiled gem, we were here three years ago and everything is as we remember, excellent food, superb pools with plentiful sun beds, the rooms are very well appointed, clean and bright, there is a gym (if you so require), 99% of the staff are brilliant but we did encounter two who were unhelpful to the point they were clearing the tables away when we were still eating!!! We complained and the service got even better from the 99%, the two bad eggs simply ignored us, if you come across them you'll know because their standard is so far beneath the others it's so apparent...but we didn't let it spoilt the hard work of all the other staff, all in all a fantastic holiday with temperatures in the high sunny 70's, low 80's we will return!!!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,2,Worrying service,"We moved to this hotel from their sister hotel in Marrakesh as the standard of hotel wasn't what we were used to so wanted to upgrade to this one. Personally I have really mixed feelings about this hotel and for that reason am giving it 2 stars To start with the good points Restaurant & Lobby staff - Great cannot fault them, went above and beyond to assist Hotel - Very high standard, rooms where huge with separate sitting area, bathroom big enough for a family of 8, very clean, modern and you can tell alot of effort and pride has gone into keeping it clean and maintained Pool - Big enough to accommodate everyone without people jumping over each other in the pool. Sunbeds are the same as every other resort, don't get there each enough and you don't get beds, the beach is superb…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,3rd time and as great as 1st!,"Just returned from another fabulous week at the Riu Palace. This hotel has everything you need from well equipped, spacious clean rooms, relaxing pool (one heated), fantastic food, and best of all the hardworking and friendly staff... Totally fell in love with Monaine, main restaurant, I don't think I've ever met anyone so happy all the time! Abderahim, lunch restaurant, made every lunch time an event and made us feel so special...a lovely guy who quietly gets on with everything whilst maintaining an attention to detail. Nora, main restaurant, again made us feel special and always on hand with a hug and a kiss. Rashid, main bar, friendly and efficient as always, year after year. We hope to see then all again when we return early in 2017.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,3,our experience at the palace WARNING money stolen!,"i have never wrote a bad review before but i must warn fellow travels of our experience here.. where do i start firstly upon arrival we was greeted with drinks and left to find our own rooms, the hotel is beautiful, rooms are big with great views from the 4th floor, there is no iron or ironing board in the rooms but u can ring down and request a iron. the food choice is varied with plenty of choice each day, i have food allergies and requested certain food daily which they was happy enough to do for me but 3 out of 4 of our party came down with stomach upsets over the week. the weather was sunny but cool on the evenings needing a light cardigan and was very windy in the afternoons on some days (none of our weather apps got the weather predictions right). the pool area is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Excelent,"Rooms large,Flat screen TV with some English channels. food good hotel was spotless. We never saw a member of staff without a smile on their face, staff were extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. the grounds are tidy and there was always someone busy gardening or brushing, pool bar staff are always tidying up after you. They do have branded drinks but you have to ask otherwise you would get the local brand. The beds were a little hard for our liking but we soon got used to them.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,3,"A dull, brown hotel","I would like to start by acknowledging how hard the staff at this hotel work. From Reception to bar staff, the cleaners,the animation team and the restaurant waiters they are amazing. Agadir is also a safe place and the promenade and beach are a real asset. But....many people mention the brown louvred wooden doors into the bathroom and toilet. These give no privacy at all especially from noise and if you have tummy problems as I did, then this is an issue. It is also an issue as they are not easy to close and the man walks into to stock the mini bar - oops. The shower area also is dark. That makes it really hard for the cleaner to get in there and clean it properly. The indoor pool is exactly as you see it on the photos. Dim, dark, dull with large brown walls. You certainly…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Excellent value for money,"Returned from a weeks stay yesterday. Overall I thought the hotel was excellent in terms of facilities, food and staff. The management were very much in evidence ensuring that high standards are maintained. If you are really picky, and some people on this site clearly are,tipping is very much in evidence and whilst I didn't if you want the best beds, tables and waiter service at the bars you will need to. I used the gym which has everything you need in it, towels, water and the staff there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. I would recommend the hotel to anyone although I'm sure the Judith Charmers impersonators will be able to fault it",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,4,Not unlimited Jack Daniels & Bombay,"This is our second visit to this hotel. The last time in December 2015 we never go back to the same place twice, but on this occasion we treated our 4 children. The reason we came back was because of the unlimited Branded drinks (we only drink JD & Bombay Gin). Last December we had unlimited JD & Bombay during the day around the pool and in the evenings. This time it was not available until the evening and then it stoped at 10pm. We are not greedy drinkers, however, this holiday is advertised as ""Premium Branded Unlimited Drinks!"" So why the change? matbe it depends on what time of year you are here? In our opinion the advertising of this hotel is misleading. Be aware of 2 particular members of bar staff, whom I won't name as one of them is actually a nice man. They…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Another great holiday,"I reviewed this hotel last year after a holiday where we had perfect weather for our 7 day stay. We returned this year for 10 days hoping for more of the same. The holiday timing was not helpful as we flew out from Gatwick at 18:45 arriving in to the hotel at midnight and then left on a 11:30 pick up. However the warmth of the weather and welcome on arrival more than compensated Check in was quick and efficient and we were very impressed in that having emailed the hotel with a room preference a couple of weeks before we arrived our requested room was available All the main dining areas are buffet style but the variety and quality of food on offer makes it hard to decide what not to choose as we were faced with at least three choices at every meal. All of the steak, lamb and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,2,5 Stars??? NO WAY!!!,"This hotel is supposedly rated at 5-stars. By what rating system? The grounds are lovely and the restaurants are decent, but not great. We stayed in a Junior Suite (which was over $500/night) which was a large room with bed and seating area in the same room, and a large foyer, bathroom and terrace facing the ocean - lovely! However, the bathroom has an internal window facing the sitting area, so it's impossible to have complete privacy while using these facilities. And, having the bed and the seating area in the same room makes it awkward to invite friends to come for a drink or chat. Our suite had a putrid stench coming from the air ventilation. We had to call the reception desk three times, and be beyond insistent the third time to get immediate attention to the problem.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Super Hotel,"Booked this hotel with trepidation after reading mixed reviews but I had no need to worry. The hotel staff cannot do enough for you to make your stay enjoyable. It was my 65th birthday whilst we were there so the hotel gave us an upgrade to our room. We were given room 94 with amazing views of the beach and sea, two sunbeds on our terrace, plenty of hanging space with hangers. Very clean hotel. The restaurant was a buffet both for breakfast and dinner with the waiters serving drinks. The restaurant staff and bar staff are very efficient and helpful. Cannot fault the food, plenty of choice and freshly cooked. The waiters made a special effort on the evening of my birthday and dressed the table and brought a cake. The on site Moroccan restaurant did the same thing and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 October 2016,5,Peaceful Week!,"We usually travel to Fuertaventura at this time of year, but decided to go across the water to Morocco. We were not disappointed! Beautiful hotel and staff are very much a credit to the management. Nothing too much trouble. We were accommodated on the 3rd floor (pool view below) and were not disappointed, room extremely spacious for the two of us and restaurant and reception on this floor. Food great choices and would highly recommend the Krystal Restaurant a visit. The bar even provides Bombay Gin Dry! Lunch served near the pool and if you miss the midday rush, quiet lovely lunch about 1:30pm. Guests are a dolly mixture of nationalists, which is very good. Agadir promenade right outside hotel and lovely walks down to the harbour. Highly recommend hotel spa and would definitely…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Almost Perfect,"I was rather nervous about this holiday because the price seemed a little too cheap but the website promised so much I expected to be disappointed. We went as a party of three, my mother and my sister and having had a great flight from Manchester arrived on a very warm evening in Agadir and immediately transferred to the Hotel. First impressions were good, however our room was not really ideal for three adults so the next day we paid for an upgrade. This did not go smoothly which it should have done and the third bed was not delivered until 10pm that evening, and as none of us are party goers my mother especially of 78yrs needed to sleep. So this was disappointing. So our first day was not ideal but the quality of food and drink on offer did not disappoint ! I have not stayed in…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Excellent - totally brilliant,"Just spent 7 nights at this brilliant hotel. What can I say, excellent food, superb staff, very clean and well worth a visit. Nothing is too much trouble. We are definitely coming back next year. Travelled from Manchester with Thomsons. Excellent value for money, ideal place to visit in November.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Great All-Inclusive Hotel,"As an American living in Morocco, it was a great weekend away that felt like a quick jaunt to the Mexican Riviera. The staff were friendly, the rooms well appointed, the food good. It sits next to a beautiful beach, has great outdoor space, and great bars. This part of Agadir feels like a cross between the West and Morocco. Even the were well done. I've been to other Riu Hotels and this one didn't disappoint. I look forward to going back.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,5,No complaints at all,"Everything works well, elegant accommodation, friendly staff, great food and excellent value for money.Plenty of activities for those interested, and regular entertainment in the evening.Just a pity that the hotel's efforts to have a fair system so that sunbeds are not taken by absentee sunbathers have been abused by the habitually selfish. This is no reflection on the pool staff who were always helpful in trying to find a place.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,"Lovely Hotel, great food","This will be a short review. I have 3 children 14.13 and 8. They all really enjoyed their holiday and so did my husband and I. Stayed half term Holidays. Weather not the best but was always warm even with cloud cover and the wind. Good food, large selection, best ever all inclusive I've had and I have stayed in 5* before. The service was very good in the restaurant. Rooms spacious, bed slightly hard but was certainly acceptable. Fridge never worked but then that never bothered me. Pool on the cool side but when it was baking hot the pool was lovely. Branded drinks always available when I asked. The hotel had a very good and well equipped gym but the air conditioning didn't seem to work. If I was to knock the hotel it would be the lack of things to do. We had 3 days of cloud…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,4,Beautiful Resort,Checking out now. So taking time to write this review. What a beautiful hotel. Would highly recommend it. We had a suite with a beautiful view of the ocean. The suite was immaculately clean. And everyday the cleaning staff did a super job. The food was excellent and around the pool is a super place to relax. I have not given a 5 for two reasons. 1. The beds are extremely hard and found myself creaking every morning. 2. Although the majority of staff are extremely friendly and helpful I found a couple of restaurant staff to be very dismissive. An example was we went for dinner quite late and wine and food was removed from our table before we were finished. Overall Morocco is a country full of colour and life and the people are extremely welcoming and friendly. I…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,4,Overall a great holiday with a few things to watch out for!!!,"My partner and I have just returned from a week in the riu palace. Overall we had a great holiday and were pleased with our hotel choice, however there is some pros and cons. Pros! Reception area and hotel itself is impressive and spotlessly clean. There are cleaners around all the time. The bar is stocked with both labelled and local drinks. Evening entertainment offers the big show and a more relaxed approach in the bar which we preferred. In the restaurant there is plenty of choice and something for everyone so couldn't moan about that. Definitely book in at the Krystal restaurant, we went for my partners birthday and it was excellent! Great food and they pulled out all the stops to make it special. It was nice to have a quieter atmosphere and be served for a change from the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,3,Fair Review - Bit Disappointed,"When I book any holiday I do read the reviews of the places I'm considering so I also like to give an honest review for both potential holiday makers and to feed back to the hotel. We booked a week away at Riu Palace Tikida for a week in the sun to relax before the UK winter sets in. We would normally opt for Egypt but after recent events we thought we'd give Morocco ago. Every review I read up until me booking our holiday was brilliant, so we were excited to be coming to stay at this resort. We had also stayed in Riu Palace Bavaro in June 2016 and had the most amazing time, so we thought we had nailed it. We landed into Gatwick about 7pm on Thursday night, 3rd November 2016 and as I write this I still feel very mixed about our stay and whether we would return again. I will…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2016,5,Fab hotel,We got back on 3rd November after staying for a week and have to say this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. The customer service is amazing when we arrived late the restaurant had been left open for us and every day there was plenty of lovely food to try. The room we had was gorgeous on the third floor over looking the pool it was more of a suite and great to have a fridge stocked every day with cold drinks. The all inclusive drink menu was extensive would recommend coco loco cocktail and they also had branded spirits such as Bombay gin and cava included. The staff couldn't do enough for you always with a smile and were so helpful. We found that you could get beds around the pool which was lovely and despite the weather we had 3 cloudy days there are…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,The very best,"Having travelled a fair bit, I can hands-on-heart say this is one of the very best holidays I have ever had. Every single part of this holiday was made perfect by the staff down to every little detail. The hotel was incredibly clean and had everything imaginable. The food was incredible! Please make sure you do not come here if you're trying to lose weight or achieve sobriety because you're very, very well looked after! Check my tip as well if receiving a free upgraded room appeals to you!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,4,One of the best,"Overall experience is excellent , friendly employees, nice restaurant , top quality food, and great entertainment for all ages , we had great time last summer The only down point is that you can t find place by the pool, since some customers reserve chairs all day long",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,Hotel with a view,I was recently at this hotel and upon arrival was impressed with the reception area and general look and feel. The staff were helpful and accommodating on check in. On our first night we had to change rooms due to the AC not cooling and then subsequently changed rooms for a second time following day for the same issue. The AC cooling is from 5pm to 5am daily which isn't ideal if it's extremely hot and want to relax in your room during the day. The views from the rooms so long as you are on the 4th floor are pretty good as long as you are sea view side. The Jacuzzi sadly wasn't working and was informed that it's subject to the sun.....really?????

 October 2016,4,NICE HOTEL just short of 5star,"Stayed one week at this hotel weather was unpredictable, unfortunately. We got 2full days worth of sun, rest of the days were cloudy. Guess thats a risk you take in October. The hotel in general is lovely! Grounds are immaculate, very large pool and nice settings. Food is spot on. Amazing selection and all cooked well. When you get to your deserts get the Bavarian slices they are amazing. Downfalls! Hotel lighting is so dim don't quite understand what there trying to achieve with it. Entertainment factor is poor! Without it though there would be nothing to do at all. They mainly rely on there animation team to do the shows which is unfair! Rooms are so hollow! You can literally hear everything to a chair move to a full blown conversation in the rooms next door and above!…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,4,"Great Hotel, Top Entertainment Team","Located right on beachfront this hotel is excellent for families. Plenty of beds available by the pool even around 9am some prime positions still on offer. As usual some people reserve beds and don't turn up til mid afternoon. Also, pool cleaning staff do reserve beds for people who pay (a common theme in the region) and this can be frustrating. No need to do this if you are up early. Good choices are great and both the main buffet and beach restaurant offer all meals with very attentive staff. If you regularly go to same restaurant at similar times, they even prepare your drinks etc. as they see you arrive. Promenade is nice and even the traders trying to sell accept a firm no and move on. Taxis are cheap but if a bigger family then get hotel staff to get 6 seat car…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 October 2016,5,Great hotel,This was our second visit to this hotel. The rooms are very spacious and clean and the grounds are amazing. The staff are very friendly and always try to help. There is always an amazing selection of food on offer that is always well-cooked and well-presented. (If anyone is due to visit soon please look out for an orphan black and white kitten that is usually around the block with room 1060. It needs feeding with mashed fish and shredded chicken as struggles to eat normal food currently.) The promenade between the beach and hotel gives plenty of opportunity for walking or cycling. The beach is sandy and clean and stretches the length of the bay. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,Probably the best hotel in Agadir,There's no doubt this is very nice hotel with excellent facilities and it is very well run. The food and drink is good with plenty of variety and there are three specialist restaurants to try. We stayed for 11 nights and enjoyed pretty good weather and had plenty of time on the beach. The sea was very rough most of the time and whilst we had some fun in the surf I'd want to keep a close eye on children. There is no getting away from the fact that this is a very big hotel (400 rooms). When it is full the sun lounge decks around the huge pool are packed and the main restaurant is very busy. It was nice to use the a la carte restaurants from time to time (part of the all inclusive package but you have too book). The all inclusive bar was generally good and we found the wine quite…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,4,Lovely hotel,"Visited this hotel at the end of September with my partner, This hotel is lovely from the grounds to the lobby and the rooms. The rooms were surprisingly large, with a sofa set into the wall a large bed,2 wardrobes, mounted TV. Very modern and comfortable for our weeks stay. The food was good although having previously stayed in Riu hotels I have experienced better food options and variety in the other hotels. Pool was clean and was so big you would think you were the only people using it. There are two bar areas around the pool which are disappointing. One bar opens earlier than the other bar and although their is self serve for soft drinks, there ended up being a lack of cups for the people and you had to que and wait for cups. Plenty of sun beds although wherever you go…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The staff made the holiday though, especially Hicham, by the pool bar fab guy, friendly and attentive. He even bought me some ice cream by the pool after the dining room had closed. All the staff were really nice and went the extra mile to make the holiday memorable. The only slight complaint would be the entertainment, its rather repetitive with the same crooner almost every night.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,"Excellent hotel, shame about the weather","I cannot believe some of the moans I have read about this hotel. I think some people should holiday with a more relaxed and friendly attitude, and stop letting tiny and insignificant issues spoil things for them. Your on holiday..... take a step back..... chill. I was blown away by this hotel from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Its absolutely stunning. I have worked in the catering and hospitality industry in my lifetime and I'm always fascinated by learning how places operate, getting to know the staff and how to get the most out of a holiday.

Constantly attending to tables, bringing drinks over…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,5,Amazing Hotel,"Just returned from 11 days here. Amazing hotel, spotlessly clean at all times. The accommodation was fabulous, spacious, comfortable and welcoming. The staff, from cleaners to Management were great and always available. Said in the Il Mare restaurant was amazing, always so very helpful and had a huge smile to greet you. nothing was too much trouble. The bar staff are happy to make anything you ask for, which was fun :-) and again so friendly. There are a vast amount of places to sit and relax with huge cushions and sofa's everywhere, even by the pool which was great. I would highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely be back, this time of year if good, not too busy and great weather still.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,3,Disappointing Riu Hotel - not worth 5 stars,"Have to agree with Jana73ke - this hotel is not up to the previous Riu hotels that we have visited either. The Reception area is impressive when you first arrive - but the dim lighting becomes depressing as your stay progresses. The rest of the hotel needs to be uplifted and updated to match other Riu hotels. The rooms are clean and quite welcoming, but the bathroom with a shower over the bath is dark and the bath should be removed and a walk-in shower fitted. This would help everyone especially the elderly, infirm and disabled. The décor in some areas needs a good clean and the walls fresh paint. The food is very much the same thing everyday - this also needs to be looked at. The dining room again is poorly lit - needs better lighting so that you can see what is on your…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,"Nice hotel, didn't like resort","RIU Palace Tikida Agadir is a nice hotel. Rooms are big and plenty of space for 3 people in one room. Facilities are the usual RIU standard. Food and drink is very good. Evening entertainment was good. Not enough going on during the day for my 12 year old though. It was very low key. Service was mainly very good. However, we had grumpy service on each day as well which let the RIU brand down. If you like to stay on the same complex (cause there is not much more to do) this is probably a good value for money holiday. Agadir reminds me of Sharm. Street sellers pestering you. Stray animals on the beach and promenade. A bit dirty etc. We won't return. Shame - nice hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Beautiful week,We visited this hotel over a year ago and had a FANTASTIC time! The pool area was lovely and the swim up bar an absolute bonus.

 October 2016,5,Amazing! Full review given!,"I'm going to start off by saying that this place was wonderful and I feel it deserves a full review. BEFORE GETTING TO RESORT. For some people including me I wanted to know what happens when you arrive in Morocco. So on the flight you will get entree cards to fill in, this gives you entree into Morroco and will be checked before entering baggage reclaim in the airport. Bring a pen with you on the planes and there are hardly any pens to fill these in by on the plane. Once we arrived and through passport control we got our bags and exchanged some ENGLISH money at an exchange. This was easy and stress free. As we were going to the coach for our transfer, nicely dressed locals wanted to take my bag and other bags to the coach for us. However they wanted money for this so I…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,Lovely Hotel however not Riu's best,"Ok let me just start by saying that this hotel was fantastic. After staying at previous Riu's though I think I have been spoilt and as I've seen better Riu hotels. From what I saw of other hotels although I would say that this was one of if not the best in Agadir. To begin with we were treated to champagne in our room for my Wifes birthday and during our evening meal the staff surprised us with a birthday cake and a rendition of Happy Birthday much to my amusement and my wifes embarrassment! The staff and facilities were brilliant although a few members of staff let the side down as they were miserable as sin, but you could easily overlook that due to the majority being really nice and friendly. The food was always very nice however at certain times the main restaurant would…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2016,5,Lovely hotel. 4th visit !,We have stayed in all inclusive hotels all around Europe. The Riu to palace beats them all The food in the buffet restaurant is so good we didn't bother to venture to the a la carte restaurants this time. We felt really safe and walked all around Agadir. Walked to the souk twice please venture out and have an explore The lovely promenade is great for a morning run or an evening stroll. The hotel grounds are well maintained but swimming pools are cold even the heated outdoor pool. We played Bocha twice a day and the animation team were friendly We never usually return to the same hotel and that speaks for itself. We have tried other places but always compare to the tikida palace and unfortunately they don't!! I drink Bombay sapphire gin and have never failed in the 4…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Had to walk out of pool sit down bar for a drink staff didn't like serving at pool for some reason not all the time but say 20% Of the time. Food nice well presented staff brilliant security men very helpful. Reception staff lovely had to say evening music could be a hit better the singer with piano man very good put him with band not so good Arabic singer went on a bit to long people moving out of bar maybe 2 sets only.

 October 2016,5,Excellent Service,"Stayed here with my girlfriend as part of an all-inclusive holiday package with Thomson after getting a favourable rate from our local Thomson Branch. Right from our late arrival to the hotel the service was simply exceptional, if you didn't have a drink, or your glass was empty you would be asked for another, if it was half full they would top it up. Even in the buffet restaurants the table service was great. We made use of all restaurants during our stay and all offered an excellent standard and choice of food. The room was spacious and of a high standard, a pity we didn't have any great views, but we didn't plan on spending a great deal of time in the room enjoying views, so it wasn't that big of a deal. The room had a safe and a mini bar (soft drinks) which was topped up…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,3,Beautiful hotel but!!!,"Stayed in this hotel last week, the hotel is really beautiful and so clean. The pool is to die for and it's right on the sea front. But the food was a real let down it was one big mash up nothing went together. Yes they did have chefs cooking things in front of you but you had no idea what they were cooking and you were not able to ask very very disappointed",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,Right on the beach,"The hotel was right on the beach and had private sun loungers, the hotel was very clean and the room was to a high standard.

High standard of work done by the room maids, visited on 13th Oct 2016",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,lovely,"lovely hotel friendly staff however tipping seems to get you better looked after (pool and dinning room) only let down really for us was the beach no padded cushions on loungers so it was uncomfortable other hotels did have cushions on the loungers, and no drinks service at the beach which would of been easy for hotel to set up .. it was a lovely hotel very clean food was fantastic ... shops across the road but be prepared to haggle half of what they say and more stick it out and get the price you think it's worth as shop keepers asking more than you would pay back home .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,amazing,Returned to this hotel for our seventh time and once again it was a great holiday .

 October 2016,5,Lovely hotel looking forward to going back,Booked holiday in march wasn't sure what to expect as never been to morroco. Got to say I wasn't disappointed at all the hotel is lovely when walking in you can see how clean the hotel is. We had a late flight so didn't get to the hotel until 12am when arriving we was told that the restaurant was still open for us to get snacks which was a lovely touch. The bar was also open so we was able to get a drink whenever we wanted. We was given a room on the 2nd floor which was lovely the only disappointment was the balcony overlooked a car park and bins which wasn't very nice. We spoke to staff on front desk and and they was fantastic and moved us the next day. There isn't much to do in the evening as very little entertainment . So if your looking for a night life this probably is the…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,5,Wonderful in every way,"My daughter and I stayed at the Riu the first week in October after booking a late deal through Thomson. Neither of us had been to Morocco before and didn't really know what to expect. Wow, what can I say about this beautiful hotel. Our room was huge, on the third floor overlooking the pool and with a sea view. It was a long walk back down to the lobby and restaurant from our room, but to be honest we needed the exercise after eating so much fab food! The buffet restaurant meals were excellent with lots of choice. Staff are so friendly and helpful. We ate in two of the a la carte restaurants - Krystal and Moroccan. Both were lovely. Star of the show there must go to Youssef - in particular he made us feel so special at the Moroccan restaurant, we loved it. As previous reviewers…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2016,5,Simplistic Relaxation,"Stayed with other half last week of September first week of October. When arrived we jumped off the bus and managed to get to the desk ahead of everyone. Asked to be able to take my bags but staff were saying no and they would carry them. when they arrived the member of staff was very clearly looking for a tip but I had no money ( had asked to exchange money at check in but asked to come back tomorrow.) Room itself was lovely ( except the light in the shower was very poor so wasn't easiest to see, especially as my eye sight isn't best) Food was lovely, i'm especially picky and eat no vegetables or fish and always found plenty to eat.(although labelling is very hit and miss so very difficult to know whats in pastries and sauces before you try it) We were both a little ill from…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,Great hotel but needs a few improvements,"Hotel - the hotel itself is great, can't complain at all about that. Food - food is hit and miss as you expect with buffet service but there are 3 restaurants you can book but are only allowed one visit per restaurant. The best restaurant was Krystal, the other two weren't great and the Italian wasn't a restaurant as it was self service and had the same food which you could have a lunch time. It would be great if you could order snacks etc by the pool side rather then having to get changed for lunch each day. Weather - the weather was good overall but there were times when it did get windy which made it feel colder than it was. Pool - the pool looks great but the water was cold, you couldn't stay in there for more than 10 minutes which was a shame. This pool could really do…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,3,Beautiful but boring,Hotel fab food fab room fab but no entertainment the animators need a kick up the bum they don't do nothing accept practice for the show they do on stage a couple of nights a week which is dreadful . If you want a quiet relaxing holiday this hotel is perfect but if you want a dance and some form of entertainment this is not the place to come . Restaurants all great food and service impeccable . Hotel is for children as well but again no facilities as such took a 2 year old and there was a pool that was so cold you couldn't go in and a beach kids club was for older children .,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2016,4,Loved it!,"Went the first week of october, did't know what to expect. Lovely weather, overcast untill 11 o'clock most days but last 2 days it was sunny from early in the morning untill the evening. Room was nice and spacious but bathroom needs a real door :-) Room 4144 has thé best view overlooking the sea, beach and hotel grounds. It's a nice and quiet location (end of the hall). Only negative is the bed is way to hard for me, i didn't get a good rest but that's my opinion. Food was délicious!! Lunch got a bit boring after a couple of days but breakfast and diner were absolutely amazing! Swimming pool and garden nicely designed. You have 2 outdoor bars, one swim up. Water was to chilly to stay in for long so if they could heat it up a bit this would be a plus! Indoor pool wasn't so…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 October 2016,3,3 out of 5 (but 5 out of 5 for effort),"Plenty of positives about this hotel: 1. The rooms are excellent and well-cleaned (I would have liked a view of the pool or beach rather than a dusty lane but that’s nit-picking). 2. The service in all restaurants is excellent at breakfast, lunch & dinner. 3. There is plenty of choice at meal times. 4. The pool is very good (although pretty cold), plenty of loungers available (I was there for the last weekend of September, beginning of October). 5. I didn’t travel with children but from what I noticed, the staff all seemed to be very good at interacting with those that were there. 6.

We cannot fault the hotel or service provided by any of the staff; the hotel is immaculate, it is being cleaned day and night. All of the staff are extremely friendly, polite and will do anything for you. They work extremely long shifts but are always smiling. The bar staff always make time to have a chat and are good for a laugh and a joke (even without being tipped - they do not expect to be tipped but appreciate it if you do), especially those that work in the lounge bar; if I knew their names I would thank them personally.

Rooms were amazing. Lovely comfortable and spotless. Staff friendly in the most. Tried a couple of the restaurants....personally id stick with the main buffet....restaurants didnt really offer anything any better to be honest. The indoor pool was nice but why so dark in there?

The staff and local people of so wonderful and make you feel lazy as they will do anything to ensure your stay is enjoyable. Facilities such as pools, range of restaurants, 7 day entertainment are great. There is a gym and daily classes along with a Spa (not used yet) excursions and local area all great so far including the miles of beach, Souk which has 6000 stalls and people do not hassle you as I expected they accept a polite no.

The luggage arrived at the 2 adjoining rooms within 5 minutes of us. The rooms are the best we have stayed in, huge bed and a ""sort of"" separate lounge area. Very clean and tidy, well maintained and a lovely bath/shower room (shower was excellent with one overhead and one at the side which was moveable), and also his and hers sinks.

 October 2016,4,Great hotel some small things could be improved,"We stayed here for a week early October and loved the hotel in general. Great staff, very very clean, large rooms and good food. In detail: Hotel is very large and is spotlessly clean, reception is busy when you arrive on the late flight but you do get a welcome drink and a cold buffet (even after 10:30 when the restaurant is shut!) My advice would be to take your cases rather than waiting for the porters. They are doing their best but are very busy and at that time of night it seems best to take them with you if you can (there are plenty of lifts) and get back down for a bite to eat. The food is great, lots of choice and all topped up regularly and prepared freshly. We didn't eat in any of the other restaurants but the buffet and beach lunchtime restaurant were great.

The room was very big and had plenty of space. There were some complimentary toiletries for us to use in the bathroom. The shower and bath area can be a bit dark as there wasn't a light in there. The bed was uncomfortable and we asked if anything could be done about that. We were offered a mattress topper. Which we accepted. This however after another 2 visits to reception to ask, it never happened. We ended up putting a sheet down and sleeping on top of that. The food the hotel has is very good.

The Hotel staff again looked after our every needs. From Management to Gardner's, from Waiting staff to Cleaners, from Chefs to Maintenance men all were there to make the holiday as best as possible all working with smiling and happy faces.

The pool was one of the nicest we've enjoyed at a resort - it's absolutely massive, is surrounded by comfortable cabanas and has a great swim up bar. The only complaint is the pool is not heated.

There were most things available in the room, fridge, kettle, mugs, tea, coffee, cold drinks and bottled water. But strangely, no teaspoons and for a 5 star hotel, no bathrobes.

We took a walk around after we checked in just to familiarise ourself with the hotel! Pool area- many sun beds to choose from but they do of course get taken very early so prepare to go down and put a towel on if that's what you like to do. We just took it day by day and if there weren't any nice beds we just went to the beach where there was always a nice bed, the sound of the sea and a nice view also!

We had a good size bathroom with separate walkthrough closet area, the over-the-bath shower was a bit dark but not really an issue.

Usual gripe about people putting towels on loungers at stupid-o'clock and then not turning up until the afternoon, but you get that everywhere.

 June 2016,3,Nice hotel but won't be going back.,"The rooms are really modern and kept to a good standard. Good insulation between rooms making it peaceful as you would want. The grounds are also kept to an high standard. One of the highlights of our holiday had to be the spa in the hotel. The Reps will try and sell you a package to an outside spa company, but it's well worth paying a few more pound and going to the hotel spa. So my advice don't book until you have at least visited the hotel spa for a look. There are two pools, one with a swim up bar and another with a hot tube attached to it (isn't hot) unless you get up at 6/7am you won't be getting a pool seat.

Annoying as it is when is 2pm and there is just loads of beds with towels on! The rooms are clean, spacious and really modern. We had cocktails waiting on arrival and had a basket of fruit and champagne in the room. The food was lovely I put a stone on in a week! So many cakes!

If you are wanting to do anything we both recommend doing the Jet ski's on the beach! Paradise valley was our only let down but we made the most of it while we was there. The buggy ride was a blast! You end up at a Moroccan mans house and he lays some bread dips and biscuits on for you. Absolutely loved Agadir and LOVED this hotel!

 September 2016,5,Great holiday,"Have just returned from a great week, the hotel was lovely and the staff can't do enough for you. The room was a good standard although I think we lucked out on the girl looking after us as we had fluff 'sausages' on the floor for a couple of days. The food is good with plenty of variety so you can eat something different every day but we noticed that some were just piling their plates with everything on offer which is possibly why they were bored with it! Not a lot of point in booking the Italian restaurant as it's self service and just a repeat of pizza and pasta that's in the buffet.The pool and grounds are lovely and well kept with plenty of sun beds, and there is a roped off area on the beach, which was cleaned daily, again with plenty of sun beds if that is your thing. We…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,5,Hotel is all you could ask for and then more,"From the minute we got out of the taxi we just knew this was going to be good. Multiple staff on reception, no delays, everyone knew what they were doing and did it very well. Special thanks to Brahim who went way above his responsibility to try and help us when our email connections wouldn't work. The food is sublime, both plentiful and of a fantastic range and quality. The chef is frequently to be seen walking around the buffet areas just checking everything is ok and seeing everyone has what they need. The waiting staff bend over backwards to help out and by the second day had already remembered all our preferences . We have to specially mention Abderahim at the beach restaurant who looked after us so well. The pool area is lovely and clean with plenty of available space and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,4,Food was the main issue,"Just stayed her for seven nights and I must say the hotel is lovely and service is excellent the only thing that would stop us from returning is the fact the food quality was in my opinion quite poor compared to other hotels that we have stayed in. Bar the food the service at the hotel was really good, everyone there wanted to help and make sure you had a nice stay, there also very generous with the drink measures also which were branded.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,Fantastic Room and View,"My Wife and I stayed in this hotel in June this year and upon a no fuss checking in went to our room on the 4th floor and we were met with a lovely spacious room with a balcony and an excellent sea view. Dinner was still being served so we went to the spacious dining room and were impressed with the vast choice of dishes for dinner a bottle of wine arrived at our table and we were pleasantly surprised that we could have had more if required. A comfortable nights sleep in a four poster bed and we were ready for breakfast which again had many choices from Prosecco to pancakes anything you could eat for the most important meal of the day.We had earlier chosen a spot by the pool , no we did not put towels on the loungers, one of the pool attendants kindly put up our parasol and a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

On arrival we still think 'wow' as we walk in to the hotel. The reception staff are always friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful. Check in is extremely quick and efficient. The bedrooms are large and tastefully furnished. The cleaners work extremely hard to keep the bedrooms and all the public areas meticulously clean. The main restaurant has a huge range of dishes to choose from. We also love going to the Marrakech restaurant, the Krystal restaurant and the Italian restaurant which you can book at Reception.

 May 2016,5,Ignore any negative reveiws !!,"As a family and part of a group of 12 people I have visited this hotel 5 times and never been the slightest bit dissapointed with any aspect of our holidays.Our group holidays range from 4 years old to 88 years old.The staff from cleaners to management are outstanding and try very hard to take care of their guests in every aspect of their stay. As most of the reveiws state the food is 1st class in any of the Resturants.As alot of people say I dont do reveiws , and at the risk of other people reading this and prices rising ! I could not speak highly enough of this hotel or staff in every department. The thomson reps also require a mention for their hard work and availability .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2016,5,Excellent from beginning to End,"Well....we travelled to Riu in Sept 2016. We had reservations as some of the reviews were a little worrying. But I can say, THEY ARE WRONG. We enjoyed every min of it. I emailed ahead of our stay asking for a free upgrade and was told that they would see what they could do. When we arrived late Monday night check in was smooth, a drink on arrival and had food before we went to the room Our luggage was in the room when we got there, the room??? What can I say we had been upgraded to a suit which was massive and more than we expected, the downside to that, was the view, it was a carpark and when we sat on the blacony that night people were shouting over at us. I mentioed this to the reception staff the next day and they immediatly showed us a few other rooms to move to and we…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The room was nice, unfortunately we requested a pool view but didn't get one but that was fine the room made up for it, spacious, comfy bed, sitting area, the mini fridge was stocked daily. The food is okay, some days are better than others but there is always something enjoyable, as well as the buffet there is also 3 restaurants which are free of charge (Italian, Moroccan, Krystal) we visited the Moroccan which was okay and Krystal which was amazing the steak is amazing!!!

 September 2016,5,One of the best Riu's,"Just back from 10 nights at this Hotel, this was our 6th Riu and 4th Riu Palace and we found it to be one of the best ones we have stayed in. Check in was quick and efficient, we were taken to our room on the 4th floor by the bell boy who also brought our luggage with him. The room was clean comfortable and spacious with a King size bed, sofa, table & chairs, large screen tv and electronic safe, however it was at the very end of the corridor and as my husband has arthritic knees we asked reception if we could move to a room closer to the lifts and reception. This was not a problem and they found us a room on the same floor but much closer to everything. The food was very good and at no point did we struggle to find anything to eat in fact most days we were spoilt for choice.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2016,5,Just Returned From a Very Relaxing Break,"Just returned from a lovely week in Agadir, I have to say we were dismayed the first few mornings with the weather as it was cloudy, but then all of a sudden, it gets to around 11 and out comes the sun, It did mean that there was no getting up early for sunbeds, there was just no need to, unless you wanted to be in a specific place, we had the same ones all holiday without having to get up at silly o clock to put towels out, and it made it a lot more restful too. Our last 4 days were bright and sunny from first off, But by that time, I had settled nicely into popping into the gym for half an hour, and having a massage, Gym is airy and well equipped, and the spa is everything you would want, very professional and some lovely massages. Unfortunatley the food was far too nice! we…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2016,5,Wonderful Hotel!,"We spent 11 nights at this hotel Aug/Sep and having travelled extensively, can say that this is up there in our top 3! We travelled with Thompson but chose to book a private transfer through Holiday Taxis to/from the airport, this was well worth it as we arrived before the coach and checked in quickly with ease and avoided the rush. We had 2 rooms and had asked for interconnecting rooms which they had said they did not provide but would put us together and to our delight when we arrived, we had two rooms next to each other with an outer lockable door which in effect meant they were indeed interconnecting! Service was good throughout the hotel, we tipped well and received excellent service but note that they do not ""pool"" their tips like other hotels. The maid service was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,4,Good holidays,"We've just stayed over a week in Riu hotel in Agadir. We' were very impressed with the hotel very big, clean and posh! Staff very friendly rooms amazing. Can't fault the hotel except food. It was very basic but ok almost the same thing every day and I had some raw potatoes and meat it caused me a stomachache few times but no major dramas. Weather was surpassingly bad average forecast showed minimum rain fall and hot days in September but we had some rain one day and few cloudy days so my partner was not very happy. You can't blame the hotel for the weather though. We felt so got taken care of at the hotel despite locals not speaking very good English ( mainly French ) and couple of small issues even though we had a very good time. I will recommend this hotel any time for couples…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Cannot fault the hotel for anything, we had a lovely welcome when we got there, our room was quiet big with a balcony, was lovely, they cleaned our room spotless every morning. The food was very good the buffet restaurant gave you loads to choose from and was different every day, breakfast was amazing to much to choose from and the staff there was so friendly couldnt do enough for you. They had a few other restaurant to choose from which was all good.

 September 2016,5,Amazing Hotel. Great staff,"If you here about the morning mist don't let this put you off. Sometimes last until 11am but is always beautiful after this. Agadir is an amazing place and everyone friendly. You will feel safe everywhere you go and the locals never haste you if you just say no once and smile. They are only trying to earn a living. Food in hotel different every day. Seafood Resturant a must but book as soon as you arrive get full up quickly. Moroccan restaurant also top class. Evening entertainment fun but don't expect a top ten star to be present. Not even sound Aline's but still great fun. Towels on sun beds the same problem as anywhere. Just talk to pool boy and you'll get the one of your choice. Tip a fair amount at the beginning. Maid, waiter and barman and you will be looked after like…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Drinks and cocktails were lovely not so strong that you can't drink! Hotel was spotlessly clean, we did have a problem 1 day with ants and manager of hotel walked passed and asked how was are stay so my husband mentioned these ants, he had maintenance there within minutes sorting it out, and next couple of days asked if all was ok.my daughter had her 18th birthday here they had champagne and our dinner table full of rose petals. Beech was just over walkway past security guards that were on gates, you can only get into hotel with bands on. Very nice and secure.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,3,Hit and miss for a 5 star,"Stayed 2 weeks and can only say very inconsistent hotel, so much going for it but let down by many little things and staff members. Location fantastic and hotel looks stunning, great beach and pools, enough sun beds to go around. Rooms, good size and cleaned every day and to a good standard, Food, lots of variety for all meal times, in the main restaurant found that certain times food can be warm rather than hot. The other 3 restaurants offer something different and you can book them more than once so well worth trying, For gents trousers are a must in the evening so take a few pairs. Drinks in bars, great choice and some premium brands which was a great plus as everything was included in the package. Pool bars, again good choice of drinks but and a big BUT, the service, of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,5,An amazing honeymoon shame about the weather!,"Having just returned from this hotel I can't find fault! We chose this as our honeymoon destination and stayed from 5th-12th September. We had a top 4th floor room with a sea view, the rooms and facilities are wonderful, spacious and luxurious. Basic toiletries provided and no robes or slippers (it's too warm for these anyway!) Rooms made up and cleaned daily with towels and bedding replaced whenever requested, the maid created some fabulous towel and clothing art on our bed each day. Minibar with water and soft drinks provided, catch the drinks man or ask at reception and they will pop beer in at request. All the staff are friendly and a little tip goes a long way, we tipped our waiter on the first night and our drinks were on the way as soon as he saw us walk in for a meal.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,1,My Honeymoon Was Ruined Here,"When we were trying to decide where to have our honeymoon, we both immediately chose to return to this hotel. Our first visit in 2013 was so perfect and we had such great memories we wanted to play it safe and expected the same great stay as before. I cannot list the complete category of issues that we experienced but needless to say I was left feeling very upset and less important than other guests that seemed to receive special treatment! A couple of points, room 2118 has a terrible 'pool view' not worth the money to upgrade. The wardrobe doors were hanging off (my husband managed to fix them but he shouldn't have had to). The door magnets to the bathroom were hanging off, the hair dryer didn't work and when reported still wasn't fixed or a replacement provided. It became…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2016,5,5* Well Worth paying the little extra,"Stayes in the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir from the 1st-8th September and booked through Thompson (highly reccomended). Flights:- Flights where with Thompson Airlnes from Manchester, out outward and return flights were on time Airport:- The Airport at Agadir is clean and modern, we had no issues getting through customs and getting out luggage. Transfers:- We opted to take a white taxi outside the Airport (official taxi) back to the hotel due to lateness of hour. It cost 220 MAD (morrocan dirhams) which equates to £17:50 (roughly) which we agreed at the beggining. We were 4 adults with 4 cases and used a 7 seater taxi. Unfortunately the taxi driver got stopped and had to pay a bribe so we paid him a little extra. Journey time was no more than half hour. The return…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is always kept very clean. The pool area is beautiful and especially at night as you can see in the picture below! There is no trouble over sunbeds as there are plenty and we were still able to find them at 2pm. The restaurants are lovely with a great selection of food and desserts. I highly recommened the Moroccan and Krysral restaurants which are booked at reception! The bar in the lobby is fantastic which is open 24hr (even better!!) with live music everynight. The entertainment is great too! You can also book a fantastic selection of excursions either through Thomson Reps or off your own backs.

Free safe in room. Drinks replenished in fridge in room daily. Staff very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Food lovely, lots of choice. Gentlemen must wear long trousers for dinner in the evening. Pool towels provided. We thought the evening entertainment was good, the in house animation team were excellent, they put so much effort into their shows, and were very enthusiastic. We particularly enjoyed the break dancing in the foyer after dinner. We took walks along the beach and promenade, down to the marina, about a thirty minutes away. We also hired bikes.

Our rooms were a nice size, and we had a good size balcony. Food was good, always plentiful and always food that we would all happily enjoy. The main restaurant did get busy at key times at breakfast & In the evening, but they were cooking constantly. Waiter service for drinks as well which was nice. The 'book able' restaurants were also very good. There were plenty of sunbeds, and whilst you had the usual group of people who felt the need to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve them (we didn't), there were plenty when we went to the pool at 9.30/10, and there were always empty ones later in the day. The position on the promenade was lovely, and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,Amazing hotel with one of the most friendly places I've visited.,Visited late August with a family of 5. Upon arrival was greeted with a smile and a drink! Check in was quite smooth and then showed to the room. The hotel is big and rooms are clean. We only ever ate at the buffet which as many have written has a wide choice of great food. Drinks were fine for an all inclusive. Any beer always tastes great when you lounging by the pool under a hot sun! I found all the hotel staff friendly and what I liked most was that they always engaged with the children. Either in conversation or just Hi-Fives which I thought was nice. In general I did find that most of Moroccans seemed to interact with the children and they see them as a joy rather than a nuisance. Swimming pool was big and my children loved the bar in there where they would drink their…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2016,5,Thanks for an amazing Holiday,We visited the hotel for one week as a family of three. The hotel was amazing from start to finish. We arrived at the hotel late and received a warm welcome and were advised that the restaurant was still open for food. We did not expect this so were surprised. The food and drink at the hotel are exceptional in all restaurants and I can confirm that we tried them all. The staff at the hotel along with the Thomson travel reps and the animation team were extremely helpful at all times throughout out stay. The hotel is amazing and I will certainly come back. Thanks for a fantastic holiday. Keep up the fantastic work. You have an amazing hotel.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,4,Not really a 5 stars hotel,"The complex is relatively new , 4 years old but already looks much older due the lack of maintenance .The restaurants offer very decent food , for any tastes, the wine selection is very very limited.

At reception with 3 sleepy children had to fill out immigration cards, other hotels tend to do this for you. Rooms were nice and big. However no robe, slippers, or toiletries, a standard in any 5* hotels. There was also no In room dining option available. Also after 4 days realised bed sheets are not changed unless you put a card on the bed. You can easily miss this small card and not realise. Again in other hotels it's the other way round bed sheets are changed unless you instruct otherwise. No wi-if in room, and signal was very poor outside the pool area.

And the staff are amazing and helpful. It's suited to older couples or if you have children then while they're really young as there isn't much in the way of evening entertainment. They do out shows on but they're not the best I've seen. That is the only negative I could say about this hotel. The whole place is clean the pool is clean. You can get sunbeds at any time of day however if you want a good spot you may need be up quite early.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2016,5,Great Stay,"Stayed at hotel from 22nd - 29th August 2016 with wife. This is the second time we stayed at the hotel, first time being in June 2013 when the hotel was only 2 years old. We only noticed a subtle changes this time round where the building has gone through some wear and tear which is expected over time and also the quality of the food has slightly dropped although it is still fantastic. This would not be noted to anybody who is new to the hotel. Taxi from Airport As our flight landed in the evening at about 2030hrs we decided to take the taxi to the hotel instead of the coach transfer, the reason for this is that the coach only departs when everybody is ready so you can be sitting and waiting for at least an hour plus the journey to the hotel is about 45 minutes give or take…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,Holiday,"Just had the most fabulous 2 week holiday in this lovely hotel. The hotel is very clean, staff are lovely and can not do enough for you. At breakfast Yousaff always had our drinks ready as soon as he saw us. Breakfast was my favourite meal, so much to choose from and the doughnuts are to die for . Khuol ( maybe the wrong spelling) was a delight at lunchtime in the snackbar, always a smiley face. Aquasize such fun .Hammada was fantastic. Only problem we really had was the beach. A small area cordoned off and along way from the sea, and all the locals 1000s and 1000s of them put up their tents in front and along the beach so you had to avoid all of them. It was easier to stay by the pool, which always had sun beds available and the pool boys fetched the mattresses. Waitress…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We arrived at the hotel well after midnight as we have a late afternoon/evening flight from Gatwick. We filled out the registration forms on the coach on the way to the hotel, so check in was very quick. We were all given bracelets that showed we were all-inclusive guests staying at the hotel. We were told there would be a small selection of food still available at the buffet restaurant. Once we got there, there was literally only a few fruits and desserts. We all went to bed starving. There were 7 of us: 3 adults and 4 kids. We were given 3 rooms with twin beds, but only used two of the rooms using the sofa in the room as a bed.

The waiters are friendly and helpful and ultimately patient with rude and demanding guests. The entertainment staff are lively and fun. The chefs provide wonderful food and are grateful for positive feedback. The cleaners are quiet, but thorough, even pulling out beds to mop on a daily basis. The reception staff are helpful and efficient. The pool staff even play with the kids whilst monitoring them. I didn't tip until the end of the holiday, but the service was excellent despite staff having no idea that they might be.

It's located on the sea front and has a section of ""private beach"", this just means a part of the beach is roped off and has sun loungers and shades. You leave the actual hotel grounds to get there. The all inclusive really is all inclusive, there were no charges for ""premium drinks"" or different types of restaurants, which was good. Although some services (such as the spa) aren't included, but that's to be expected. The hotel has a children's club and pool (right outside the room we stayed in), and that seemed well used. We really liked our room (1144, in case you're interested). It was spacious and had everything we needed. Although I would prefer the door to the toilet area to have been more solid, they have louvre doors. Just…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,Fantastic hotel!,"I stayed in this hotel from the 18th of August to the 25th of August this year. The hotel is absolutely beautiful both inside and out. We couldn't have asked for a better looking hotel. Everything was very clean and was constantly being cleaned by the hotel staff. Our room was spacious and was very different to any other hotel rooms I've stopped in before; different in a good way though. The animation team were fantastic, very sociable and very friendly. The entertainment at night was good but most nights me and my family were too tired to stay up due to the excursions we had been on. We went on 4 trips throughout our stay, booked with the Thomson rep who worked in the hotel. A day trip to Marrakech, a four by four ride around the Atlas Mountains of Agadir, a 2 hour camel ride…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Wonderful Helpful Staff,"Lovely Hotel upon our arrival at the reception and whilst checking in I requested a room with a view of the sea as i tend to spend a bit of time in my room chilling and having a drink. I was told this would be fine However when i got to my room i would need to be a giraffe to see the Sea, However the room itself was lovely so not all bad, When the porter arrived with our luggage i mentioned it again in conversation. About an hour later the head receptionist came to my room, after a brief conversation she asked us to follow her and led us to the most beautiful Room with a full view of the sea and beach suffice to say from that point on the holiday was wonderful excellent food great staff bending over backwards and the most touching point was as we were leaving the hotel manager…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,Blinding Hotel,"Great hotel, rooms and grounds great. Food really nice, red wine on an all inclusive usually disgusting, this place had lovely wine!! The a la crate restaurants were lovely apart from the Italian which was a waste of time. Beach overcrowded, dirty, sellers everywhere, walked straight back in the hotel. We spent our whole holiday in the hotel but this was fine as the place was great. Gym a bonus, spa good. Best 5star hotel we have stayed in abroad. Would return for sure Don't be put off by the cloudy weather in the morning, it does clear up so get them towels out!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,4,Honeymoon,"We stayed for our honeymoon for a week. The hotel is lovely very impressive lobby when you first walk in. We didn't tip all week but only because we never had the same waiter more than once and we generally too when we have had some continuity.still had good service. I wouldn't say the hotel was five star maybe a good four. Only because we have stayed in many five stars and this hotel didn't have that extra edge others have such as poolside waiter service, beach bar etc . Rooms are lovely very large. We had to call security one night as someone was throwing things at our patio doors at 1am and they were there in seconds so that was good. Food was nice, Moroccan and krystal better than main restaurant. We loved agadir, didn't mind the sellers as we are used to them from holidays…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,just come back,We have just spent 2 wonderful weeks at this hotel and absolutely loved it. The staff are amazing and the animation team are brilliant. we knew about the cloudy start to some days but it did not spoil our holiday. Brazilian restaurant we thought was very poor but the Fusion was good. Lunch time menu was a bit boring but still okay. Entertainment was good too. Getting branded drinks was a bonus.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 November 2015,5,stunning,beautiful hotel! service was one of the best I've had. food was good lots of fresh fruit and freshly cooked food but got a bit repetitive towards the end of the week. very large room for only a standard double with a dressing area and seating area (free mini-bar). weather even in Nov was good. We always found a sun lounger even getting up at 10am! even got a large bed two days. Fully all inclusive - even branded spirits! There was a small children's pool and kids club but it's not a hotel I would bring my children too.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,3,twas good,"Belly dancing, breakdancing and banana smoothies. The hotel was up to date and nice. The wifi was variable and you can only access in certain areas. There is a 24hr bar and many other places to pick up drinks. Breakfast ends at 10:30 and is busy at 10ish. Most of the times we were there we would have to queue but the always went to meals at peak times. Food is nice but i found myself eating the same food often. Service is alright probably better if you tip but we never carried money as it was all inclusive aha. The room we had was nice. The bathroom has no locks in it but hey ho. Night entertainment is fabulous if you like break dancing or belly dancing. If you don't you are out of luck. There is live music in the lobby though.

 August 2016,4,First trip to Morocco ☀️,"My husband and I have just returned from a two week stay at the Tikida Palace. The hotel is beautiful-a hugely impressive reception area, beautiful gardens and ideally situated on the promenade in the middle of Agadir beach. We paid extra for a pool/sea view which we would highly recommend. The room was quiet with a lovely big balcony and views across to the marina and Kaspar. There was a fridge which was replenished daily with water and soft drinks as well as tea and coffee making facilities. The food was lovely, always plenty to choose from at the buffet. The only downside was that the main restaurant was very loud and chaotic. People were pushing in the queues for the show cooking and children were running around picking up food and putting it back on to the buffet. We…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,Highly recommended for Agadir !!,I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Agadir. The service is exceptional and its clear that the management are doing a fantastic job here. The accommodation is well looked after; very clean and pleasant. It sits right up near the beach and a great location. A quite busy promanade can be accessed from the rear of the hotel. There is a great variety of food across a number of restaurants so something for every taste. Lovely pools that were enjoyable for all. Animators were very friendly and talented. The talent was restricted only by a small stage. The highlight for me was the spinning dervish. I would have said the belly dancing but I know my wife will come across this review at some stage. We did not explore all the services nor did we venture too far…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,5,Best holiday I've had,"This holiday was amazing, the service was outstanding and everybody was so kind and friendly... They just couldn't do enough for you!!! We felt like we were living a life of luxury and was treated like royalty. I would 100% recommend to stay here, I would also suggest upgrading to a pool view room as when we had our courtesy room we were facing a car park and the Main Street- that is just a personal preference though. Another plus is that they do use international brands along with some local brands and you can see for yourself as they are making your drinks what brand is being used. I just can't fault this holiday at all and I hope this helps :) the photo below was the view from our room.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Having read previous reviews after booking I was sceptical about visiting but the reviews couldn't have been further from what we received there! We found all the staff to be polite, friendly and attentive with no need to tip. Always received drinks quickly in the restaurants and we were always able to have a chat and a laugh with the serving staff who are professional but friendly and don't take themselves too seriously. Out of all the meals we are there (3 a day for a week!) we only had to queue for food at one meal time the rest of the time we could get what we wanted with no problems and considering it was peak season the hotel was far from…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,5,Fantastic!!!,"This place is like a little slice of luxury. The hotel and all its rooms are lovely and luxurious but comfortable. The food and drinks were lovely, all very fresh. I travelled with Thomson and can wholeheartedly say that the reps, Dan and Hatim, were fantastic. I arranged a couple of trips with them and they were exactly as I expected (if a little better). I was genuinely relieved I did arrange through them as others booked trips via sellers in the street and never saw their money again and didn't get picked up for the trips. I was looked after when I had a problem while away and Colette (the Thomson manager) met with me to help. If you read any bad press about this place please ignore it. I will definitely be going back, can't wait! The people, the reps, the hotel, the country…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,4,"Lovely Hotel, But Agadir not a true representation of Morocco","This is my opinion of our annual family 2 week holiday commencing 21/07/16. We have visited Agadir about 17yrs ago but I did not recall finding it as we did this time. Flight: A little late setting off, but no real problems. Return flight, cabin crew seemed hurried and disinterested probably due to it being a night/early morning flight. Reception: Arrived late night. Check in uneventful, cheerful welcoming staff, drink on arrival. Restaurant was kept open with a selection of buffet food for us to enjoy before bed. Bags were delivered to rooms. Rooms: Had emailed ahead to ask for rooms next door to each other. This was granted. We had a twin and a double (really needed 2 twins but no real hardship having to share with my daughter).

This was our first holiday as a new family, the staff were fantastic, so helpful, caring and considerate. They loved our little one (11 months), taking time to say hello and help entertain him when he had a whinge. The food was a great collection of Mediterranean, Moroccan, and home style foods. My family were very happy with this and the selection of accompanying drinks far surpassed my expectations (included champers) The setting was beautiful and the local people ( even the lookie lookie men ) were happy and polite. We got some good advice from a couple of them. The beach looked wonderful but shamefully we didn't step foot on it, needed some reasons to go back. We would…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2016,4,Lovely hotel ...... weather not so great,"Just back from a 11 day holiday at the Riu Tikida Palace, and had a lovely time. In summary, the hotel was great: great location next to the beach, food was good, bedrooms big and clean and staff friendly and helpful. Staff - lovely. Always there to help, and always with a smile. When you ask for something, it was there straight away. Rooms: spacious Lovely rooms, spacious and clean. Try and get an 'even' numbered room so that you are facing the pool and not one of the service roads on either side of the hotel. Can also get noisy with children running up an down the corridors.

 July 2016,4,Relaxing hotel,"Knowing already the hotel, I reserved for 3 nights. My first remark was, there no bath product, and no slipper, furthermore, the key card they gave me, stopped working, I call the reception from my phone, cause the phone in the elevator near my room didn't work, and since the room is far from reception and I was so exausted, I asked them to bring me a new one, but they didn't accept, until I argued with them several minutes. in a nutshell, the service is worsening",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Food was fab although I'd recommend booking into Marrakech/Krystal as they get full quick.. And wow! Marrakech restaurant was mind blowing .. Even my picky eater teenager ate the food and the service was fantastic... If I could pick this hotel and move it towards Immouzer/paradise valley then I'd be in my element as Agadir is spoilt by people who just dump litter .. We personally avoided the beach as by lunchtime it became a tip and was awful .. Be warned of scammers ..

We saw 6 really bad arguments over sun beds with the local people chucking peoples belongings into the pool so they can have the beds, the hotel done nothing about it. As a riu member they didnt treat you any different, other hotels are fantastic and treat you all the time Pool bar service terrible. Service around the pool terrible.

I've spent more than 20 years travelling the world, stayed at 5* hotels regularly and since my stay here I now compare every elite hotel against this one.

When we arrived at the hotel it was mid afternoon and we were greeted with a cocktail reception. The hotel itself was so grand and absolutely stunning! Our bags were brought to our room after check in and we headed straight to the pool area. The rooms were beautiful, so modern and clean and even have a walk in wardrobe area.

The staff were very friendly, the rooms were cleaned to a very high standard every day and the food was always great. Loads of choice at meal times and excellent service. Pool area was always busy with the usual putting towels on to reserve beds that you always get in these types of hotels. It wasn't always easy to find a bed as people would put their towels on and then go out for the day. A section of the beach was cordoned off for hotel guests and that was usually pretty quite.

We were in room 4123 and it was nice, faced a path but you could see the beach so that was nice. Balconey was huge, nice in the evening sitting having a drink before dinner. The bathroom was very modern and nice to have a shower and bath. Hair dryer provided and wasnt that bad either.

The lobby is huge with plenty of seats to get comfy in the evening. The hotel only has wifi in the lobby, restaurants (not really round the pool), therefore it can get quite busy in the evening, however we never found a problem getting a seat. The room we had was on the 4th floor, very clean and everything functioned as it should. It had a seating area plus a balcony side view which was great to relax in.

I can't imagine how it would be with noise above as well! *Even numbered rooms face the pool the odds face the main road *Don't expect much to eat when you arrive after a late flight! We had a pizza from La Maxwell's restaurant across the road at 1am *Ladies may need an extension lead for hairdryer and straighteners as lack of power points in room *Unfortunately you will need to get up to reserve a sun bed if you want a nice spot.

We didn´t feel the need to go out of the hotel garden, everything we needed for a relaxing vacation was there. The only downside was the room we got, it was facing the delivery port!! So our balconies had the view over staff on a smoking break, trucks delivering goods and staff coming in and out of work...not very pretty and very, very loud especially early in the morning. So be careful of what room you get! I would definitely go again, but not if I had to stay in the same room!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,5,Wonderful Resort,"Still here enjoying a week long break. It's my first all inclusive and it's absolutely great. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. Every evening is a show of some sort which keeps everyone entertained. The security is great as it doesn't let anyone out with a red band (the band kids aged up to 18 have to wear). My boys are aged 13 & 14 and they can't even go on the beach without an adult accompanying them which suits me fine!!

The al a carte restaurants are good but they sort of rush you through as you have a set time to eat in them and they need to get set up for the next setting.

Although we had a good time it did not match the experience we had in Cancun. The rooms were good so no issues there and the housekeeping staff did a great job. The reception staff were very helpful and courteous. So what were the issues? The waiting staff in the buffet restaurants particularly at lunchtime were slow to serve and in some cases went out of their way to avoid you. We did complain to one of the supervisors and was told to relax and smile, a little condescending don't you think! I will say that the waiters in the Krystal and Moroccan restaurants were excellent and did a great job. Around the pool no waiters came around and asked if…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The pool area is very nice. Unfortunately it lacks the little things like a pen and paper in the room the hotel does not supply this or little bottles of shampoo, conditioner etc etc for a hotel of 4 stars I found this surprising. I was not impressed with the cleanliness as my shower head was disgusting. The drinks selection is not great by the pool. We did go in March so the pool was cold and so was the Jacuzzi.

There are metal detectors at the entrance of the door with a security guard - which made us feel safe. We was greeted with a non-alcoholic cocktail on arrival and was given a room straight away. The rooms are very spacious as well. The pool beds are very comfortable and you can change your towels as often as you like.

We asked Thompson if we could be moved to a hotel in Marrakech but sadly they wouldn't help us. Determined not to be defeated and to get some vitamin D in our one week of annual leave together, the kind staff at this hotel offered to transfer us to a Riu just outside Marrakech, free of charge, the Tikida Palmaerie, where I sit now in 40 degree heat and blistering sun.

Drinks were really good for all inclusive and with the meal you get a bottle (not a glass) of wine!!

Arriving by private transfer and thus avoiding the check in line consisting of an entire coach load of guests, we were greeted warmly at reception with cold fruit drinks and checked in quickly. The porter followed more or less immediately with our cases. Having to be fitted with and wear a plastic wristband was an unexpected annoyance, which we'd not experienced before. It just doesn't feel very 5*. The lobby is large and impressive, the rest of the hotel equally so. Everything is fairly new and kept well. We changed some currency, painlessly and at a good rate.

 July 2016,3,A long but honest review.,"Arrival- Received a welcome cocktail, check in was quick and easy and was given room cards (we was only given one, so asked for a second after a couple of days to make life easier for us) and pool towel cards, luggage was taken to our room for us. We arrived after 11pm and was happy to see the restaurant was open incase people was hungry after their flight. Rooms- spacious and tidy, bathroom was lovely with an amazing shower that I never wanted to get out of and twin sinks, however the hairdryer provided was broken the first night I went to use it, so we had to ring reception to get someone to come fix it. The electrician came after half and hour and problem was solved, although reception decided to ring a week later to see if the problem was solved... A bit late to check if you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,4,Lovely holiday with a few niggles,"We stayed here for a week and on the whole it was excellent, food and wine of a good quality and a beautiful hotel. We usually go to adults only hotels but although there were lots of children it didn't bother us. We also found the beach very nice, big waves and lovely sand. There are some people selling stuff outside hotel but a polite no and keep walking does the trick, we were not harassed at all in the beach. The pool area is huge and kept very clean but it is incredibly busy and we fell into the trap of feeling we had to get up early if we wanted a sun bed, by 8 a.m there were very few left near the pool and although pool attendants helped find beds you would really struggle to find one after 9.30/10. Many beds are reserved with no one coming to them until after lunch. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,5,Fabulous holiday,"Excellent hotel offering everything you need for a fantastic holiday. The restaurants and food were first class - so much choice. Second week the hotel was crowded as previous reviews have mentioned but the excellent staff managed to cope. The rooms are spacious, there are plenty of sunbeds and providing you reserve one by 08:30 should easily find one you like. Weather was a bit funny second week, with mist in the afternoons, but still very hot. The beach area at Agadir is superb. We found plenty to do in the evenings and would recommend this hotel to anyone.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,4,Beautiful hotel but not alot at night,"Just returned from a 10 night stay at this hotel, travelled as 2 couples and got rooms next to each other. On arrival we were met by the entertainment staff who gave us our all inclusive wrist bands & welcome drinks. Reception staff were very friendly and check in was very quick, we were given our keys & towel cards for the pool. Rooms were very spacious and clean with a living area, balcony, queen sized bed, wardrobes, spacious bathroom with bath/shower and twin sinks. The room had a free safe, tea/coffee & free mini bar which was restocked every 2 days (soft drinks only) The pool area is huge! Lots of beds but yes they do get reserved quite early we would go down at 9.30-10am but would be able to get 4 sunbeds together though. The weather is very strange, its cloudy until…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,Lovely stay,"I won't babble on about the food, service etc as I've stayed in many Riu's and all provide excellent service and a good selection of food (even though it does get a little repetitive!) Just a few things I picked up on.. We booked our flights and accommodation separately.. Really worth looking into as it saved us a good few hundred pounds than going through a Thomsons. Booked Easyjet flights, hotel directly through the Riu website and private taxi transfers online (they were about £30 return) only thing if you decide to do this.. Make sure you take the card you paid with for the hotel! We didn't bring the card (silly I know) and have a bit of a palava where they had to refund the money back to our original card and then pay again. Very helpful and easy to resolve but would have…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,Fantastic Holiday,"First trip to Agadir, first time in a RIU Hotel. Well it will not be the last either. Agadir is a beautiful destination, the people were friendly and we felt completely safe out and about, nice walks on the sea front every day. The hotel, Riu Palace is exceptional, beautiful gardens, nice airy well decorated and well laid out rooms, cleaned to a very high level. The cleanliness of the rest of the hotel is top notch. The food is excellent with a superb variety, the restaurant service is 10 out of 10, staff couldn't do enough for you, our glasses were never empty. Same on bar service, excellent, thank you. Entertainment is good with both singers and dancing. Highly recommend this hotel. Thank you all for a fantastic holiday from management to bar to restaurants. Will be seing you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,3,Definitely not a 5 star!,"We just came back from our one week holiday at Riu palace. When we came to the hotel we didn't get any welcome drink (I assume only large groups of people get this), well I don't care for this but than they gave us a room 1088, I have to say that we paid for pool view, but what we got was smelly room with large cockroaches. And the view... well definitely not a pool view. We went back to the reception and told them about the situation in the room, they were just smiling at us like they are stupid. Than we got another room and they said that we can only be there for one night, than we have to come back to reception and they will give us another room. Well next day at 2 pm we finally got a normal room which is expected for 5 star hotel. In my opinion rooms are a little bit dated…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,5,Wonderful holiday,"Would highly recommend this hotel, beautiful rooms, gardens and decor. Staff very helpful and nothing seemed too much trouble. The one piece of advise I would give is don't plan your visit to coincide with the end of Ramadan and the following 5 day holiday/festivities. It appears the wealthy Moroccans descend on the hotel with their children letting them run amock around the hotel, climbing on the stage when the acts are on and flying around the lobby and corridors at speed on the motorised/electric skateboards. General disrespect for other holiday makers. Some families went for lunch coming back to find their sun loungers had been taken and were subject to a tyrade of verbal abuse when they returned and confronted the people who had took them. Also a lot of the shops were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,3,Expected More,"Came here for sun, relaxation and to get away from it all with my family. What we got was Smog, ( of which the sun actually comes out for an hour at most if you're lucky ), if you're looking to relax then forget it! I've known British kids with severe ADHD that behave better than some of these kids. They run amok screaming, knocking over glass jars that display red roses in the lounge/foyer area and are the rudest kids I've ever known and I don't even have to speak the language to realise their behaviour warrants a clip round the ear. There are a limited selection of restaurants available, but a plus for the ones you have to book early for to avoid disappointment, the food was awesome. Thankfully we managed to get the ones we wanted, trouble is only ours and about 10 other…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,3,Not five star and ruined by unruly children and miserable bar staff.,If you are looking for a cheap extra get away then book. If this is to be your only holiday of the year then go elsewhere. This is not a five star hotel. The service at the pool bar and reception bar is shocking. Most of the staff are rude. The service in the pre booked restaurants is fantastic and faultless. The wine is also drinkable and full bottles will be left on your table at dinner rather than being served a glass at a time. Another big problem in this hotel is the amount of rude and unruly children. When I read this on previous reviews I brushed it off as people just not being into children. I can honestly say as a mother myself I have never witnessed such bad behaviour by children even in the worst areas of England. French children were encouraged to click fingers…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2015,5,Worth every penny,Excellent hotel with amazing staff. the food is a good variety and very nice. this is a hotel where you can just stay within the resort. loads of shops out the front. the only downside is the beach but the pool makes up for that.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,5,Great Stay during Ramadan,"My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel from July 2nd-9th and had a fantastic time. The majority of our holiday was during Ramadan and we were very happy with the service we were provided; all the staff were very friendly and always on hand to help. The bar was all inclusive including cocktails to the relief of my girlfriend. All food was also all included and we were amazed by the quality and choice that was on offer, 4 different restaurants (our favourite of which was the Moroccan). The only negative I could find was that towards the end of our holiday the hotel was getting quite busy which meant there were a lot of queues to get food and drink.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2015,4,Lovely Hotel in a good location.,"My husband and I, travelled with another couple for a last minute week away. The hotel did not disappoint. I have stayed in a few Riu Palaces and this lived up to my expectations. The Décor in reception was absolutely beautiful and hotel was well kept throughout. Food was great (especially the Moroccan themed restaurants) A good location - shops are near by. Staff were excellent, all pleasant and helpful. Room was clean, tidy and well maintained. Would definitely go again. TIP: if you fancy going out of the hotel for the evening, ask at reception for a nice restaurant in the harbour below the Kasbah. We had amazing fresh food there! We had 5 courses (including lobster) and lots of drinks all night which worked out around £25/30 each at the time. The food was better than most…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,5,words can not describe my stay,First when you enter you are amazed by the comfy lobby sofas and chairs. You are given welcome drinks. We stayed for a week and did not want to leave. The staff was friendly and you never get bored or hungry. After breakfast there is lunch and in between lunch and dinner there are snacks in case you get hungry. In the pool area the staff is walking by and telling you that this game is starting and if you want to play. The room was huge with a FREE mini bar. Yes I did say a free mini bar. It is all insclusive and get as much drinks from the bar as you can. I went there after every 10 minutes and every time they greeted me with a smile and never said that you have had alot of drinks. Overall the best hotel I have ever stayed in. You must go there.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2016,4,Luxury hotel in a great place,We booked with Thomson holidays. A guy called hajid was the rep. Very helpful guy. The rooms are well appointed and spacious. The staff very attentive. The pool was fantastic. The food was a little repetitive if you stay more than a week. Do the Krystal restaurant it was great. We then went out for our last night to Pure Passion. Nice ending.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2016,3,Stunning Hotel But Unfortunately Fails to Live Up to Expectations,"Our first visit to the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. As this was a family vacation our 20-month old toddler, this review is written from a “family-friendly” perspective. There are many pluses and minuses with this hotel but unfortunately here, the minuses outweigh the pluses for us. PLUSES: + Beautifully designed hotel with spacious well-manicured gardens. The lobby is stunning and the rooms are very spacious. + Welcome drink of fruit juice upon arrival in the reception + Money exchange at the hotel is fair and convenient + The hotel’s gift shop is convenient for international magazines and souvenirs as well as necessities you may need during your stay, i.e., shampoo, feminine hygiene products, etc + Although this Riu is not geared as a “family” hotel per se, we found the staff…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,Fantastic week away - detailed review (mid 20s couple),"FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Arrived 20th June late evening (7 NIGHTS), first impressions were amazing! Received a welcome drink while queuing for check in. Small hiccup with the room key as it didn't work when we got the the room, this was resolved quickly. They do explain where your room is and leave you to find it, this was a little confusing as the hotel is relatively large and confusing when you have just arrived, your luggage follows you shortly, we were in our room when the porter dropped off our luggage and they expect a tip, as we had just arrived we only had large value notes so we had to tip nearly £10 (100 dirham), my advice is either ask the front desk to change some for you or dont be in your room when they take the cases up. ROOM: We had room 2026 which was a garden/pool…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2015,5,Excellent hotel!,"We had an excellent stay here and didn't want to leave. The staff are so friendly and can cot do enough for you, ensuring your drinks are always topped up and to see if there is anything else you need. The hotel itself is fantastic! Very clean, room service everyday and toiletries in the bathroom. The rooms are lovely! Spacious, clean and very well decorated and looked after. Amazing pool and pool bar and the hotel is literally 15ft away from the beach where they have a private section for hotel stayers. Food is incredible all day! So much choice!!! I would highly recommend this hotel!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,We shall return,"This was our first visit to this hotel and my wife and myself enjoyed every moment. We were greeted by a friendly and helpful reception staff. Our room was spacious and clean with a balcony overlooking the sea and swimming pool area. The maid did a great job keeping our room clean each day. The food was 5* and well presented. Plenty of choices, well done the chefs. The staff in the restaurant were helpful and attentive. The dinning area was always kept clean. The pool and entertainment staff were great. One of our biggest gripe in hotels is the cleanliness of the toilets but here they were kept clean at all times. A big thank you to all the staff for making our stay so memorable. Looking forward to our next stay.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2015,3,Won't rush back,"Beautiful hotel, rooms were beautiful, food was a bit crap apart from the breakfast even the a la carte restaurants were not to the stand I thought they would be, staff are nice and helpful if you leave tips, I wouldn't be back here in a rush but it was done up nice",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,LOVE IT,After reading the last two reviews I don't think I can have been to the same hotel! If you are a young couple and what lots of nightlife and loud music round the pool this hotel is not for you. The hotel staff are wonderful working long hours for little money and yet in my opinion always pleasant. We never had any trouble getting served at the main bar or the pool bar. The food was excellent plenty of choice. Always a full bottle of wine left on your table at lunchtime and in the evenings too if you wanted it. We had walks on the prom if you tell the locals no thank you they don't pester you. Agadir is no different to anywhere else you always get pestered wherever you go the only difference here is once you say no they don't bother you. The animation team try really hard but…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,4,Lovely hitel,"Good all rounder hotel spacious and great for a relaxing week, there isn't much to do but what do you want a beach holiday for? Relaxing. Don't go to the souk it wasn't great. Use the local shops facing the hotel. Do the day trip to Marrakech there's a lot more going on there. Hotel is clean, premium drinks, lots of food choice. No problems whatsoever. You can get a late checkout for about £45 change money at the hotel too. Suncream absolute rip off so make sure you take some or buy at duty free going out. Take a pen with you to bear the queues on the way in to complete the visa when you land, get the slip of paper and fill it in whilst you queue.

The hotel itself is spot on,really clean, well looked after and very grand looking, the rooms were cleaned daily aswell as the mini fridge stocked daily with fizzy drinks and water (all included in your price) The pool area was again very clean and tidy(ish), some parts are dangerous with broken tiles, some of which are sticking up and could cut someone or someone could trip and fall. Always make sure you get up early to get a good sun bed, I was up at 6 everymorning and even then a lot of beds were taken,..

 June 2016,3,Not a 5 star.,"After reading some of the latest reviews of the Tikida Palace I was left wondering if I had stayed at the same hotel.check in at the hotel seemed to take forever as our flight was delayed and not enough staff present, then we were informed by the Thomson rep we would have to wear the 80s style wrist bands for the length of our stay , not impressed. Your told on reception your room number and where it is then left to your own devices to find it , not very good really if your an elderly person , cases will follow when the porter can be bothered.The bedroom itself was very spacious and looked to be ok until it was seen in the light of day , not to clean , cup stains , glass stains hairs in the sink , not 5 star cleaning.Breakfast is taken in the buffet which is nice and presentable…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Weather in the mornings it was overcast the sun did not come out until late morning/early afternoon the locals told us that this was normal but when it came out it was very hot and a nice breeze.MY ADVICE is take something for the night it can get a bit cool when walking outside the hotel.

The staff are the gem of this hotel, they are so friendly, approachable and will bend over backwards for you. We traveled with my 6 month old daughter and she was adored by the staff. They would really interact with her and by the end of the holiday everyone knew her name. We loved that you could have champagne anytime of day and that the drinks were all branded. The food was lovely, lots of variety, we especially loved the Oriental themed night. More themed nights should be implemented! ! The room was very clean and the mini bar was well stocked.

 June 2016,5,Nice Relaxing Break,"I chose this hotel on a recommendation of a friend who stayed next door and I wasn't disappointed. Greeted with warm smiles and a refreshing drink after a ridiculous wait to get through immigration. The hotel is pretty large, took us a while to find our room. We were in room 1022, perfect location pool in front, bar and the beach just the right. Room was very spacious, only down side no plug sockets near the mirrors to do my hair. The sheets/towels were changed every day, mini bar was also stocked every day this included water, soft drinks and larger.

Wifi is free in all public areas and if your lucky in your bedroom is is the best signal we have ever had on holiday, I tested it and was getting 38mbs! Food is varied and plentyful and drinks flow easily, including branded spirits if wanted. Rooms are comfy and spacious although the bed was a little hard for us.

 June 2016,5,Relaxing Honeymoon,"We enjoyed a perfect, relaxing honeymoon here. Appearance wise the hotel completely extravagant and spotlessly clean. The reception area just blew you away as soon as you walked in. Our room was very large and fitted out tastefully. When we arrived there was champagne, a fruit basket and biscuits laid out in our room. A lovely surprise. The variety of food was perfect, every day there was so much to choose from. I was never bored with the choices. The pool was very clean and inviting. However, it was very difficult to get a bed unless you got extremely early and put a towel out. Most of the time we gave up looking. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our honeymoon.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2016,4,Overall lovely holiday,"Lovely room (hard but very large bed), really easy and friendly check in - thanks for the adaptor as we forgot ours! Cleanliness in nooks and crannies wasn't great as lots of dust but didn't affect our stay. Lovely bar area both by pool and in the lobby. Fairly awful evening entertainment but good evening food - lunch is a bit of a free for all and no changes daily like in the evening which is a shame. Amazing pool area and great to have staff helping guests find sun beds and umbrellas so everybody is catered for. Overall lovely holiday but always room for improvement :)",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,Surprised at just how good this was,"Loved the spacious rooms, pool area and amazing food. Staff were so helpful and friendly - especially around the pool.

 June 2016,5,Would highly recommend,"I would highly recommend the hotel and cannot fault it at all. We stayed for a week at the end of June and loved it. All the staff were polite and helpful, from the reception staff to the bar staff, pool staff and restaurant staff, and in particular one of the animation team, Youseff or 'youyou' as he preferred to be called. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel, the grounds and the rooms. The food was all very nice and there was a lot of choice on offer during breakfast, lunch and dinner.

 June 2016,5,Wonderful! Long but detailed and some useful tips we picked up along the way!,"We got back yesterday from a weeks stay in this hotel. It was amazing! Room: Big ! comfortable and clean. Tended to daily with the option of having fresh towels every day if you want to. A big double bed, tv, sofa area, balcony, shower and bath, twin sinks, separate toilet, lots of wardrobe space. One thing I will say is be careful with the safe, when you lock it be sure to hold it shut as you input the code etc. as we found the first couple of times we did it it would make a funny noise telling us it had been unable to shut properly. Staff: Everyone is very friendly and willing to help you with anything you need, if you do tip waiters/bar staff etc of course it is going to improve the speed of service and encourage table service etc. but when you look at the currency…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2016,3,good hotel let down by too many small faults,"We watched this hotel rise up, over the years, from the waste ground that it was originally on & finally in June this year we managed to stay. Our holiday started well. But as the holiday went on a lot off small niggles started to appear. I am not going to write a long list but I have been in enough 5 star establishments to realise that there is a problem, it is not with the waiters, bar staff, cleaners etc etc, but with the lower management. They should doing more checks and getting fault rectified, I am sure that if I could see light bulbs out in our corridor, a dangerous loose paving stone near pool, people having to get up at ridiculous hours to reserve sun beds just because 1 large family decided that they would, food spillage on floor in main reception not cleaned up till…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2016,4,Long... Honest review!,"Right so I'm going to do this review in sections as I there is so much to go through... The rooms: Room 4018 has a sea/pool view. Honestly the nicest room I have ever stayed in. Two sinks, bath/ waterfall shower, toilet, huge bed (baring in mind though they don't do double beds it's two singles pushed together but it's not bad!), Tv, couch, table and chairs... Everything basically! Free use of safe, tea and coffee making facilities and a mini fridge which is stocked everyday. Only slight bad thing I would say is there's no dressing table so I had to do my hair sat on the floor with the straighteners dragged halfway across the room. Food: the buffet is ok. Good for even the fussiest of eaters. Only thing is, it does get repetitive. By about the 4th day, I was dreading lunch.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,3,Beautiful hotel Awful staff,my friend and I (both girls around mid 20's) traveled to Agadir and stayed here. I had pre-booked the hotel and upon arriving they caused an issue about no payment. I refused to pay again as I had paid already. Our flights had been delayed and had to stand in reception for hour because the hotel staff had to call Spain to confirm payment etc. It took them an hour to sort this mess. After waiting so long they gave us keys to our room. We went to the room to find someone else's belongings and a dirty room!! Quite clearly someone was staying there. We called Reception and they said they made a mistake and to go to another room and wait until someone comes there.

 October 2015,4,Gorgeous getaway,"We stayed at the RIU Tikida Palace in October 2015; check in was pleasant although the staff tried to take our bags off of us so that they could then take them to our room– I have never understood why they insist and can be quite rude when you say no, but eventually they let us take our bags ourselves. Walking to our room, the one thing that jumps out at you is the sheer size and open-plan reception/bar area which was lovely of an evening to watch the sun go down with a nice cocktail. Our room was large, with a separate wardrobe area and bathroom, the toilet was hidden away behind louvre doors which was nice to have this separated from the main washing area. The bed was large and comfortable and the balcony had plenty of room to relax in the evening; we were situated on the side…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,3,Not a 5 star hotel,"We are currently staying at this hotel and have been here for 9 days now. The positives are that the pools are lovely, the food is nice (buffet and a la carte) and the rooms are reasonable. The hairdresser is also very good if ladies you fancy taking advantage of the cheaper colour prices. The major thing that lets this hotel down is the service; we have found the service from reception through to the restaurants to be really poor. This in our opinion cannot make this a 5 star hotel. Agreeing with a previous fellow reviewer, this could be a 4 star, but do not book this expecting a 5 star hotel with service. Some things to note: - unless you tip service staff from the off (rather than tipping to thank/commend service) you will be ignored - this hotel caters mainly for the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2016,5,Another fab holiday,"This is our second year here and yet again another brilliant holiday. The manager and his staff are a credit to the Riu hotel chain. Nothing is too much. The location is superb, easy reach of shops. Beach right in front of hotel. Morocco is all about haggling for your purchase so be prepared to be approached a lot but just say no and they will move on.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,4,A really good 4 star hotel,"I'll apologise now for the long review but I want to give a good overview of the Riu Tikida Palace! We stayed here for a week from 16th to 23rd June booked through Thomson holidays. We arrived late in the evening and were presented with a welcome drink on arrival while we waited to check in. The reception staff were super efficient with the check in process, however maybe a little too efficient!! They seemed to want to rush the process and it was perhaps a little impersonal to be honest. We had emailed ahead to say we were visiting to celebrate our engagement and could we have a double room rather than a twin on a high floor and received a reply to acknowledge this, however nobody mentioned a thing to us as they just seemed to want to plough through the many people waiting to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Absolutely fabulous AGAIN,"Well as you may have guessed I returned to this wonderful hotel again at the end of May and I am really pleased to inform you that it is still GREAT the standards have been maintained in all areas, cleanliness, comfort, service and friendliness from all the staff. The location is excellent with shops and restaurants (not that you need them) are just outside the main entrance and if you fancy a stroll along the promenade the harbour is about a twenty five minute stroll away and if that seems a bit long for some of you just jump in a taxi (make sure it's an orange one if there is less than 3 of you,and confirm the price before your journey) and for 20 Dirums (£1:50)they will take you. It's the same price from the hotel to the large souk nearby and there are always plenty of them…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,4,What a lovely holiday!,"Me and my boyfriend wanted a relaxing holiday and we got that and much more! The food was good, lots of variety so even fussy eaters could find something! There are also two restaurants within the hotel, we went to both, but one of them (Krystal) was excellent! The steak was amazing, best steak I've ever had! And the service was great. Plenty of drinks to chose from which are all freshly made. The room were lovely and spacious. We had a twin room which suited us perfectly as the beds were separate so we had our own room but pushed together so we could have contact. It was also really clean every time the cleaners went it! Couldn't complain at all on that. The entertainment was good as well. We only saw it twice as neither of us really like that sort of 'all inclusive…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2016,5,A wonderful Honeymoon,"From entering the hotel to check in to leaving reluctantly 1 week later, we enjoyed every minute of our holiday here. The staff are efficient and friendly. Food amazing, I really can't see how anyone can complain about it. Pools kept clean and pool guys really helpful, with plenty of sunbeds to go around. Drinks were well made and good service. Room was spacious, free mini bar, bathrobes, kept really clean, shower lovely and powerful, large balcony. Massage in hotel very relaxing. All pros and no cons.

 December 2015,2,Aesthetically pleasing only,"The hotel its self does look beautiful but that's all it really has going for it. If your happy to just sit around and drink and eat in your hotel all day this is for you, it wasn't for us. Dont be fooled by what the rep tells you about going to the 'local pub' where she goes to chill out. Pffft. We ventured outside the hotel which was an experience in itself under the advice we went to a pub that all the reps go to, we stayed for one and quickly left. We were hassled all the way to and from the hotel either by street sellers or beeping taxis who shout out their windows. There is a section of beach outside the hotel which is roped. However a seller followed us from the hotel to the beach and sat and watched us and shouted at us until he saw someone else to try and sell to. In…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,5,Well worth a visit.,"Just returned from a wonderful 2 week stay at the Riu palace Tikida. We have been fortunate to stay at a few Riu Palaces and this one certainly didn't disappoint. The hotel is stunning, and is kept immaculate. The hotel lobby/reception area is massive with countless comfy sofas and chairs for relaxing or catching up with social media. The rooms are beautiful, we were upgraded to a suite which was quite impressive and the hotel gave us a basket of fruit and bottle of champagne to celebrate our anniversary which was a lovely touch and much appreciated.....THANK YOU.

 June 2016,2,June 2016,This is the first time in all my holiday's I have actually wrote a review while I am still at the resort. Unfortunately the bad out way the good. For a palace this has to be the worst for entertainment and bar's are poorly staffed there is NO cocktail bar. Whatever you do if they give you the ground floor refuse it as most guests decide to hold full blown conversations at the top of there voices after the entertainment is finished by that I mean once they have had a skin full of poor local drink. IT is a shame but RIU PALACE you have got it completely wrong this time.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Probably not a ""classic"" five star but it's way up there; great room, terrific staff, excellent food. Here for a fortnight and all was going well until a couple of mocknies arrived half way through. What a bunch of prats. I new things were going to go downhill when, on their first day and full of drink they started diving off the pool bar top splashing other guests without a care in the world. They've been drunk ever since, from 10.00am onwards. 'effin and blinding at the tops of their voices with young kids all around.

 June 2016,3,Enjoyable and worth the money,"We stayed at Riu Tikida Palace on the 13th June for ten days with Thomson. The price of the holiday was a bargain!

 June 2016,4,"Overall, an excellent hotel","This hotel is very large and modern with a lot of guests. The hotel mostly had a relaxed atmosphere to it. There were a lot of areas to sit around in the huge lobby with comfy couches to sit and have a drink. I was most surprised that all drinks were also free in the all inclusive deal. Whatever you wanted, you could order it, bottles of coke, wine, beer, cocktails, morrocon tea etc. Even in the rooms there were drinks in the minibar which were free including cans of coke, sprite, fanta and water. The rooms were fairly big, some have a lounge area, with flat screen tv etc, and the beds were generally comfy. The only problem with my room was that I was located right near the lift and overlooking the outdoor bar area, which sometimes got very noisy, with some drunk guests (free…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Although the shower would go from scalding to freezing, so I wouldn't want to come with children for fear it would happen to them. Food was excellent, and service was very good, facilities were good, location was perfect. Most staff were amazing, our room cleaner was lovely, and Yousef, one of the animation staff, was a pleasure to meet! Reception staff very helpful and the staff in the shop were also very nice. Downsides: although it's stated that sun loungers can't be reserved, they were nearly all taken extremely early in the morning it became quite irritating when animation staff would ask if you would like to participate in activities…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,5,Lovely hotel in good location,"We got a great deal through Thompson with an upgrade to a massive sea-facing Junior suite for very little extra. It had a huge bedroom/sitting area (with a swivel TV in the centre of the room), 2 bathrooms, walk-in wardrobe and generous balcony. Really lovely and well maintained/cleaned. Only negative was there was no WIFI, but we survived... The pools were lovely if a little cold (1 was heated but only just, the other was freezing). No problem getting beds by the pool and they and the grounds were immaculately kept. Beach scene was not so great though as that area didn't seem to benefit from the same attention to detail and was a bit utilitarian in my view.

 June 2016,5,Brilliant hotel,"Just got back from an excellent week at the hotel rui palace. We had recently stayed in an ultra all inclusive, so we were worried that we might be disappointed, but we weren't at all. The food and service was brilliant. The room was large and bed very comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the entertainment on offer and there was always somewhere comfortable to sit and relax. We did a day trip to the paradise valley, which was nice to see. The swimming pool is very cool, but you do have to get up quite early to get a lounger. All in all we loved it!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is stunning, the pool area is beautiful and we never found it hard to find sun loungers. The staff are lovely and will go out of their way for you, we stayed here when it was Ramadan and thought we would see a difference in the service but the staff were great. Tip about 20/30 dirhams, they will still go out their way even when you don't tip them, but we thought they deserved it for their hard work! The food is nice, there was always a variety, theres two other restaurants that you need to book in, make sure you book early as they get filled up. The Krystal restaurant is amazing and I highly recommend it. The cocktails and wine were nice, didn't really try any other drinks.The rooms are spacious and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Bar service you soon learn is based on a tiping system I do not blame the bar staff/waiters as this is allowed to happen but once i had tiped my face seemed suddenly noticable all the time before this there were times when i may as well of been invisable.

The entertainment is great if you are 10 years old and under. Agadir offers very little to do in the evenings with a few bars and a Mc Donalds. On the plus side the staff are very friendly and rooms are great.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,4,Very enjoyable stay!,"Me and my boyfriend have just stayed here for a week and are sat in the lobby right now upset to leave! Firstly we were a little disappointed with our room which was on the first floor and overlooked a road which made us feel a little unsafe, after expressing our concerns and enquiring about an upgrade to a pool view room, we were disappointed to find out it would be an extra £210 for the week. Nevertheless we did get our room changed the next day to the top floor, lovely view and no extra charge. Reception staff are great and a credit to the hotel, they do their best to make sure their guests have the best possible stay. Thank you!

On the third day, our card had stopped working, one of the attendants at reception offered no apology and rudely returned a working version after realising the hotels error. In the evening on the same day, a waitor made the effort of shouting across the dining room to prevent me from taking away a 330ml bottle of fanta to my room ( hotel is all inclusive).

The Riu palace is definitely the best hotel I've ever stayed in, the staff were extremely friendly, approachable and the service was 2nd to none!. The facilities, the room, swimming pool etc were immaculate. It's by far the most cleanest, modernised, friendliest hotel I've stayed in. The food in the hotel was very scrummy and after the 4-5th day it got Abit boring. We only managed to get one reservation only at the Marrakech a la Carte restaurant as it was pretty much booked up for most of the week we were there.

Restaurants are proper restaurants with table cloths and cutlery on the tables; not like the canteen type dining we gave previously experienced on all inclusive, albeit the buffet is self service. Wine served at the table by the bottle and not the glass. Waiters and Waitresses very friendly. There were two a la carte restaurants available which need to be booked via reception.

 May 2016,5,Lovely Riu,Our third stay at Riu Palace and still as great as ever. It's hard to find anything to add to previous reviews. The staff are very attentive and seem happy to do all they can for you. They pre-empt your every need. Our side view room was lovely and great for people watching as they stroll to the beach. All the rooms are large with good sized balconies. The only annoying thing is people who reserve sun beds and then do not appear all day. The staff will always find a sun bed for you so there is no need. The food is excellent and there is something for everyone. There is a very relaxed atmosphere around the hotel. Security is good and we felt very safe and relaxed walking around Agadir. Good for shopping for leather goods and you can have a made to measure leather jacket…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Mariam,"Second time to riu palace and I would go again, went for my sons 4th bday as we took him on his 2nd and he loved it. I will be taking him again. Staff are fab, food was great, immaculate hotel, manager al berto was great. The desserts are just outstanding. My son is very fussy with his food, but I managed to find him something every time although he did stick to toast and Nutella choc spread for breakfast! Which I'm glad they had. We came across a wonderful taxi driver called Mr. Belaid. He couldn't do enough he was brilliant. He took us where we wanted to go and told us about the best places to visit. We went on the big wheel further down the promenade. There's a little zoo there too. We went to the markets souk el-had but you need to haggle a lot!! Mr. Belaid was so…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2016,2,Not very good experience,"First booked through expedia late at night. Received confirmation email from expedia but the receptionist refused to acknowledge it. She said the booking is not showing on the system. After a while (around midnight) we came to an understanding that I pay cash for the night in advance and if they get the booking on their system next day they will pay me back. They paid me back next day but they could have proposed that option in the first place and I would have gotten more sleep time and avoid unpleasant exchange with them. The front office supervisor came did not even acknowledge my presence discussing my case with another receptionist without even so much as saying ""hello"". Same thing next day he was discussing with them the return of my cash after they received the booking…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Fabulous,"We have just returned from our week stay. Fabulous. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much for them. When we arrived at the hotel we where greeted with a drink and the staff made us feel very welcome as soon as we walked through the reception. The hotel is exceptionally clean, There are plenty of sun beds by the pool but f you can't find one the pool staff will gladly find you one. The food was great, plenty to choose from. The promenade outside the hotel is lovely, so nice to have a stroll in the evening. Can't wait to go back. Thank you to the manager and staff for making our holiday a memorable one.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2015,5,Honeymoon,"We stayed here for our Honeymoon and was blown away the hotel was fantastic good food recommend the special food nights they were really really good, friendly staff couldn't do enough for you. Generous with wine at dinner defiantly stay all inclusive if you stay here as apart from the beach out side i wouldn't go too far country itself is very poor and many beggars try to get in cars etc, I would say it's a 5 star hotel plenty of choice for food with my wife being fussy she managed to find stuff everyday which was a big positive.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Suprising!!!,"Ten of us ages 38 to 65 came here to celebrate a friends 60th birthday, travelling to the resort via Easyjet and booking direct with the hotel. We also arrange our own transfer with Suntransfers. Personally I didn't want to go for reasons I won't go into, but the holidays turned out to be absolutely superb. The rooms are very clean and our maid Saina (Ithink the spelling is correct) was brilliant nothing was to much trouble. She spoke a little English but we're in Morocco so I did'nt see it as a problem. We had clean towels every day and sheets could be changed every day if you wanted. The bed was huge and the room consisted of wc wash area with bath/shower twin sinks and plenty of room. Bed area and down a couple of steps to a lounge area leading to a balcony. Flat screen tv…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 May 2016,5,Amazing holiday,10 of us stayed here at the start of May for 1 week. The hotel and grounds are lovely and modern and the rooms are very spacious. We found the staff to be very attentive and friendly. It was our 1st year wedding anniversary whilst we were at the hotel and they went out of their way to make it special. Sending champagne to our room and decorating the tables in the evening with rose petals. The food is of a great quality and we found it to be varied throughout the stay. We loved receiving bottles of wine on the tables at lunch and dinner rather than by the glass. Certain staff members stood out for us and are mentioned below: Rachid (pool guy) Racheeed ( bingo/breakdancer) Rachid (singer) Jawad (bar) Faizell (bar) Youness (restaurant) Souvanne (restaurant) Keep up the good…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,THE GOOD AND NOT SO GOOD OF AGADIR,"Myself and husband checked into this hotel for 2 weeks on the 16th May. Check in was speedy but it took over 90 minutes for our cases to arrive so my tip to all would be to take your own case to the room once your have checked in and then go down for evening meal. Decor, gardens, layout of this hotel cannot be faulted. Our room was on the side facing a wall but could see a bit of the sea, I suppose the only downside wall it did not get any sun but did not want to upgrade and spend any more money. The room itself was stunning, amazing shower and kept really clean at all times by the cleaners. Food at this hotel is amazing with such a wide choice of all meals, even fussy eaters will find something. At lunch it was nice to eat outside as inside it felt more like a canteen…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Excellent Hotel.,"Great hotel, lovely big bedrooms. Location very good right on the promenade which is great for walking. The food and service were super.

 May 2016,3,"5 star resort, 3 star service","Went for a week with my girlfriend and was desperate to stay at this hotel based on the good reviews. I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong the hotel itself is fantastic - great pool area with plenty of sunloungers, fantastic food and entertainment, etc. BUT the service let it down. Upon late (standard Thompson) arrival, I was given a room that absolutely stank of smoke and it took about 3 complaints (and basically the whole) first day of the holiday to sort this out and get moved to a different room that itself was not cleaned until around 6pm the following day (someone's underwear was left by the sink). Neither the reception and Thompson staff seemed that interested and even the complimentary late check out as an apology ended up being more hassle than it was worth. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Heaven on earth,"Spent the best week of our lives here in May with our two kids aged 18 months and 11 years. From the minute we arrived the kids were treated like royalty. The hotel is stunning rooms are complete luxury and the service is best in the world. From the bar staff waiting staff cleaners reception and security they were all lovely amazing people. The Riu animation team are second to none they are loved and adored by everyone they work long hard hours keeping everyone entertained and they do it so well. Khalid Anass, rachid, abdu best guys in the world my kids adored them and we all agreed the holiday wouldn't of been what it was without them ❤️",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Wonderful hotel,"I just spent a week at this hotel with 11 friends; the hotel was really good; much better than expected. It wasn't a problem to accommodate us sitting together at any of the meal times; the food was varied each day and nobody complained about it. There was plenty of sunbeds and we all sat together. I arranged for the 12 of us to eat in the Crystal restaurant to celebrate my birthday. The staff were amazing and kindly decorated the table for me with balloons, banners and other bits that I brought with me; when we arrived at 9pm it was all done and looked lovely. They also made me a cake and the champagne was in the ice bucket at the side of me. It really turned out a memorable night. We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves; the weather started a little hit / miss but picked up…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,1,Previous review was deleted ! Our stay was a nightmare,"Our stay was ruined due to a group of guest who where very inappropriate around other members of the public. They where disruptive to majority of hotel including staff from the Thompson rep. We've never seen such behaviour any holiday and was shocked that the RIU staff condone their rude and aggressive behaviour at the hotel with families and kids. On arrival to the hotel we was given our hotel keys and weren't shown how to get to our room we had to pretty much figure this out ourselves. They did send down someone with our suitcase however, he was lurking around for a tip which we gave in the end. Some of the staff at the hotel were very nice and did their best when they could. Were others would only help of you had tipped them. we was told before arriving at RIU TIkida…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

If you have booked a holiday here you are in for a treat and if you haven't book ! The food is great something for everyone,I heard a couple complain they did not do chicken nuggets for there children ... Really is that the best us Brits can complain about !! The rooms and surrounding areas spotless and the staff incredibly friendly and a little tip every now and then does not hurt. The spa is a real treat also, if you want to relax, eat great food and drink branded drinks welcome to the Palace Riu !!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,THE BEST EVER,This really is the best holiday we have had. The hotel was brilliant with so many great staff. We arrived 15 minutes before my birthday which led to the best day ever ending with Champagne and a Birthday cake after our fantastic meal in the Moroccan Restaurant. We love cats so the idea of a Cat Cafe within the grounds and the fact the hotel feed and look after them is such a great idea. All the cats looked healthy and well fed and we never no trouble in fact there was one cat sitting on the net of the table tennis board while two guests were playing. Priceless!! To sum it up in lines which are easier to read. Food and Service were excellent Drinks were of good quality The staff deserve there tips and that's what they got. The room was an excellent size and very clean. We were in…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Perfect loved every minute.,This hotel was everything and more than we wished for. The staff were great the hotel was clean and the food was catered for everyone. I always said I want to see the world and would not get stuck returning the same hotel.... Now we're looking for a return visit. Ignore the negatives.... We did and loved it. Remember you will never always get a sea or pool view from your room but who goes away to sit on the balcony. The staff are very busy and will get drinks for everyone but be kind and tip them. The reps are on hand daily and would rather deal with any issues immediately than get slated by people who won't approach them. Just go and enjoy it,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Go ahead and book!,"What an excellent hotel! This was definitely the best hotel in Agadir. The reviews were brilliant but we saw it ourselves just how great it was! Upon walking along the marina, it is evident that Riu Palace Tikida is the best of the best. The staff are so friendly and really make an effort to make sure you are happy and always smiling. Although the Thompson reps recommend a place around 8-10 mins away for a hammam and massage (which is cheaper), I must admit that added cost for doing it in the hotel spa is worth it. The hammam was brilliant, they do it thoroughly even between your fingers and behind your ears! The massage is the best massage I've ever had! To end with, the hotel manager came on each coach to thank you for choosing their hotel and even apologised if…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Room was great had a pool room on the 3rd floor 3144 best view of the mountains sea and pool. . The hotel never seemed packed and there were always sun beds available and places to chill out and grab a drink. . Hotel entertainment was fun and enjoyable. Negatives: .

 May 2016,5,So many real problems!! :),Myself and partner stopped at this hotel during May 2016 as part of a Thomson Twin Centre package with Marrakech at the Riu Tikida Palemerie (separate review on their page) In all honesty I struggled to enjoy my break due to the many reasons outlined below 1. On the second day of my stay our waiter at Breakfast had the temerity to not leave the Tea Bag tag hanging out of my tea pot. Other guests Tea Pots clearly showed the tag which made me unable to enjoy my three plates of varying breakfasts and glass of Champagne. 2. Having recovered from the Tea Bag episode in attempt to cheer both myself and my distraught partner up we requested that our cleaning staff arrange our towels in to varying World monuments.

 April 2016,5,Birthday treat,"Booked for the other half's birthday in April, it also happened to be the only time I could get off before the Summer. It was his first experience of All Inclusive and from my perspective was not a let down. There was a good selection of food available neither of us are fussy and will try anything at least once. The drinks available where as you expect and we didn't find anything other than the Rose wine that we wouldn't drink. You could tell that the hotel was getting ready for the start of the summer session as not everything was open such as the swim up bar (however the pool was cold) and maintenance was going on and it was pointed out one day and done by the next. We where bother very impressed. Ok so the only real down point was the beds, we had two singles, yes they are…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 May 2016,4,Honest review,"Righto! Will try to give a brutally honest review in a way I would find useful! Overall - good hotel with excellent facilities, generally helpful staff and exceptional levels of cleanliness. Food quality and preparation is fantastic; if you can't find something to eat you are very, very picky. Things you can't change! The guests - some very rude and exceptionally arrogant guests of all nationalities. Tipping early in your stay will guarantee better service, whether you like it or not. Either tip or be self sufficient, don't say I didn't warn you!!! Beds at dawn. I'm going to be honest, the only time we had problems getting sunbeds was when there was a big influx of Brits. We are definitely the worst nationality for reserving beds, and not using them, come on guys!!!! The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,Group Holiday,We stayed here for 7 nights and this has to be one of the best hotels I have visited. I loved the fact that the hotel had a 24/7 bar! All staff are extremely friendly and helpful. This hotel is located in a great location near all bars clubs and restaurants. Rooms are modern and beautiful. Food is delicious. However wifi was only available in reception and pool area I think having wifi in the rooms would be great too. Pool area very pretty literally few minutes from the beach. Overall I would come back here and definitely recommend this hotel while staying in Agadir.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,3,Hit and miss,Ok so if I had reviewed this hotel on day 1 and 2 it would have received no more then 1! My initial opinion was very low and I was disappointed to have chosen Riu palace ESP after great trip adviser reviews In a nutshell in March I made a special request for two quiet bedrooms next to each other - I followed this up again before traveling. On arrival I was given rooms down the corridor from one another and a really noisy room where ppl said bye near the lifts to the bar and you could hear their whole conversation and they were clearly drunk One night these English lads had a huge fist fight right outside our room -bear in mind I'm traveling with a small baby and toddler I spoke with reception straight away saying there had been some mistake and I had made a special…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,"we never go same hotel twice, but we did here","2nd holiday to this hotel, went same time last year, such good value that when we was looking for a cheap week away it was too good to miss. rooms very nice, had a 4th floor this time but faced the car park area to the side and didn't get any sun but we don't spend any time in the room apart from sleeping so it didn't matter that much. i am very fussy but know it's my problem and always found something to eat, there is loads of choice in the buffet, just that i don't like much. drinks are branded but this year we did find they are kept in the cupboards where as last year they was on display. maybe a cost cutting exercise. they did usually run out later on in the evening but had more again the next day. pool is very big with lots of beds, we never got there before 10 ish…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,4,OUR THIRD VISIT,"Still good value for money, hotel staff absolutely amazing.....however quality and choice of food gone right down since our last visit 2 years ago! Our main bugbear was the fact that this 5 Star Hotel has always advertised and previously readily supplied 'International' Brands Alcohol .......NOT NOW I'M AFRAID!!! The last 2 times it was available in all bars but this time only in the Reception/Lobby Bar (albeit hidden away in a cupboard under the bar). You would almost have to beg for this and after you'd had a few then they would conveniently say that they'd run out!.... New Management Cut Backs Maybe?!!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 April 2016,4,No complaints,So the hotel is up to the standard you would expect from a Riu. The room was lovely food very good and lots of choice. Sun beds the most comfy I have known. There is a lovely promenade at the back of the hotel and a blocked paved way that takes you all the way to the Marina which makes for a lovely stroll in the mornings. Outside the front of the hotel lots of shops and things to look at. Over all I enjoyed my week in April there very much. Staff could not do enough and the manager even got on the bus when we were leaving to say goodbye to us all and to ask us to tell our friends to visit Morocco so here I am.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2016,5,5 Star hotel,"Just spent a week at the Tikida Palace, what a beautiful hotel. It rained five days out of seven, but the hotel is so good it really didn't matter. We spent a lot of time in the Spa which is breathtakingly beautiful and very reasonably priced. Weirdly, the gobby Thomson rep told everyone not to use the Spa facilities as it was so expensive, this definitely isn't my experience. The food at the hotel is superb, we ate 21 meals without repetition, all super fresh, beautifully presented and served by happy, helpful staff. Drinks are excellent, the house Rose, Red and Cava were all excellent and plentiful. Our room had a garden view, it was HUGE, very very comfortable with excellent linens. I can't think of anything negative to say about this hotel, I would return in a heartbeat.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,Five + Weeks of Heaven.,"This was about our 20th time at The Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. Again all the staff were so friendly and helpful. The Management team are always on hand should you have any problems, which they sort out within a reasonable time. Chef puts on some amazing food at all meal times. The animation team are very friendly and are always trying to get you to play games or go to their shows. The grounds of the hotel are well looked after and cleaned every day. Although some people say its hard to get sunbeds unless you are up early, we dont have this problem We go down just before breakfast and plenty around Its if you want a specific place you may have problem. All I can say now is this is a very well run hotel with Great Management and Staff that make sure we all have a great holiday.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,4,3rd Stay. Lovely but beware of weekends,This was our 3rd stay since 2013 and I can honestly say the service is still excellent. The staff are as always very friendly and the place is exceptionally clean and immaculate. The food was still very good as were the drinks. A big thanks to all of the animation staff who were again excellent. In fact I would say that every aspect of the hotel has improved except for the problems I will mention below. Now for the bad part. Unfortunately the hotel needs to do something about the issues raised at weekends. Rich Moroccan families descend on the hotel at the weekend as is their right and I would ordinarily have no problem with this. Maybe we were just unfortunate on this trip. The noise levels around the pool and in the food areas increased tenfold and many of these families…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The girls at the Riuclub entertained my son and made his holiday very special. Rooms were spacious and clean. If you have a late flight, we paid an extra £45 to keep our room till 5pm. This meant that we didn't have to rush on our last day and were able to shower after a long day in the sun. The food was lovely, enough choice for even fussy eaters. The speciality restaurants get booked up very quickly. We tried the Moroccan one, it was nice but definitely lacked the atmosphere of the normal dining room.

Room was great, so much room with a cracking bath/shower that was powerful enough to to blast off your suntan! Maid was also excellent. Food & drink in main areas was good although a bit repetitive. Staff in bars/restaurant/entertainment very friendly & helpful. Used indoor & outdoor pools which my little girl loved especially the slightly warmer 2nd outdoor pool. Beach & promenade very nice with a few locals pedalling their wares. Moans - Corridors to rooms are quite long and echo especially late at night with new arrivals and doors slamming.

You would always see the cleaners and gardeners keeping up the appearance of the hotel and the waiters and waitresses always happy and talkative. For the cost of the holiday, we really couldn't fault anything. The food was always good from cooked dishes, salads and desserts. There is definitely something for everyone.

 December 2015,5,Amazing Hotel!,"Everything about this hotel was amazing - the food, cleanliness, staff, service, decor, pool and location! There was a massive range of food at every meal and it was always delicious. Everywhere was clean including towels and bedding. The staff and service were always excellent and you could order a drink from anywhere as a witer came over as soon as you sat down. The decor was amazing, especially in the rooms and the lobby area. The location was brilliant, on the beach with a promenade between the beach and the hotel, go out the back of the hotel and turn right - you will walk past shops and restaurants before finally arriving at the marina. You can also get a 5 minute taxi ride to the souk which cost next to nothing and have a look around all of the stalls. In all this hotel…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 May 2016,5,Amazing Value!!,Just returned from a brilliant holiday staying at the palace. On arrival the reception staff were very helpful and they had the bags taken to our room. The room was lovely and spacious and very clean. We tipped the cleaners early on and they always did a great job. The pool was great and there were plenty of sunbeds. One thing that came up in conversation a lot was that there are signs everywhere saying that you can't reserve sunbeds but people always got up early and bagged the best beds but then would barely use them or turn up after lunch which is a bit unreasonable but each to their own. They just shouldn't have the signs up unless they enforce it. The Thomson's reps were very helpful and we did go out and explore on their recommendations. All in all a fantastic…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,5,WOW!!! That's the only word that comes to mind!,"This was our very first stay in Morocco, but totally exceeded my expectations! Everything about Riu Palace Tikida is just brilliant, the hotel, facilities, rooms, pools, all the staff that couldn't do enough for you... and the food! (only let down was some of the evening entertainment, but they did try hard to be fair) Everything is so clean and tidy, all the gounds are immaculately kept. Room 4106 where we stayed is the pool view upgrade one, but so worth it! It is actually away from the pool so no noise, close enough to the restaurants and the reception, close to the pools and bars, just perfect! So large with a massive balcony (the only negative was that we only got the morning sun, but that's probably a good thing if you travel in the summer). The beds are very…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,Amazing Holiday,"We have just returned from a weeks stay at the hotel, I honestly can't fault anything here! There is never an issue with sun beds no matter what time of day you want one! The room was large and clean, mini bar stocked daily and cleaner did an excellent job. Hotel staff are friendly and always willing to help even if you don't tip. Food choice was great, yes you may see the same foods on most day but you have plenty of choice, including those who like chips when they go away. Drinks were fantastic and we never had a problem getting name brand drinks! Measures are large so beware in your cocktails! Bar in lobby stays open 24 hours for those who want this. The animation team really do a good job, yes they try to get you involved but then are fine if you say no, they still make time…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2015,5,A great hotel for family time,We had a great time with the family. Nice hotel. Great location close to city center. And right by the beach. Great for afternoon walks. Pool is awesome. There is a bar in it. Spend few days there. Did feel the time pass by.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,Great hotel,I really enjoyed my stay here. Fantastic. Value for money. Excellent food and service. Beautiful rooms. Convenient and reliable transfers to all golf courses.

 May 2015,5,Fabulous,"Usual fabulous RIu hotel especially being new at the time . Fabulous service, pool, food and accommodation. No noisy entertainment at night which was good, nice piano etc. Agadir itself is not very nice and a bit intimidating as my party was nearly all female with young teenage girls and was harrassed by local young men constantly Whilst walking and shopping but i am told is always the same in muslim countries. Only downside was checkout my friend and i had to pay for another room to change etc due to very late flight.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,AMAZING!!!!,We have been searching for an alternative holiday location to Sharm - and we have found it in this hotel in Agadir. I cannot praise this hotel enough for the pure quality of everyone and everything that they offer - and that also includes the fantastic offerings of food in all restaurants at all times. The buffet is the best ever and I have travelled a lot! Booking in of a coach load of holidaymakers took about a total of 10 minutes - fantastic.i could go on forever about how good this hotel is but my typing fingers would ache!!!! We had one small problem which the Manager Alberto got involved in and sorted it with speed and efficiency - thank you Alberto. We will return in the Autumn and many times subsequent to that. Please go!!!!!!!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,Excellent 5***** Holiday,"Did Egypt 2 years ago and thought it would be hard to beat for accommodation food and service but Riu Palace surpassed everything above and much more.There are not many places left in the world where you can feel safe out of the complex but Agadir is defo one of those.The people were great,the usual people trying to sell and make a living but a firm no kept them at bay. The 5 star hotel was exactly that food excellent and staff were awesome.The young guys who were the entertainment were out of this world.You have to see them to believe what they can do",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 April 2016,5,One of the best holidays,"I visited this hotel in 2013 with family of 32!of us in total and this hotel could not have been more hospitable! First of all the rooms were absolutely spotless, the hardworking cleaners would come to clean the rooms and provided us with fresh towels and sheets every day. The food was delicious, something to cater for all, the delicious tagines and roast chicken were our favourite. The animation team were also brilliant, not the usual cheesy type. Overall I would definitely come back, thinking of booking next year too :)",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,"Excellent Resort, re-booked as perfect for the family!","We visited this hotel with our children (7yrs & 4yrs) and grand-parents during the Easter break. I must admit, the hotel is amazing in every way. From the personal greeting upon arrival right through to the personal goodbye from the Hotel director (Alberto) upon departure. We requested 2 adjoining rooms, where were catered for. The hotel is very well located with superb facilities for all ages. The food was always excellent with a different choice in the buffet restaurant almost every day. We recall speaking to other senior and well travelled guests who commented on how good the hotel and its facilities were. The staff were extremely polite and never hesitated with any request. This is part of the reason why it is a successful hotel. The pool area is very clean and has ample…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 April 2016,5,Excellent resort,"I visited this hotel in aprill I have stayed at many al inclusive resorts around the world and this one has to be among the top ten in terms of value for money,location,staff and general quality and ambience.The hotel grounds are wonderful as well as the rooms you can pay extre if you wish to stay in a pool view room or sea view.The lobby bar area you can relax in the evening after you have dined in restraurants premium spirits are available on some nigghts if they haven't finished.The bar is open 24 hours! Most places are within walking distance ie fast food places and restraurants.The marina is perhaps worth going in a taxi especially if you are dressed bit it is still possible to walk.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We have visited most of the major tourist countries on the Mediterranean and north Africa, but Morocco was a surprise . The people are so nice and friendly . Agadir has a long stretch of beach with a lovely promenade and all very modern .Its kept very clean and you feel so very safe walking about . The Riu tikida palace is one of the best hotels we have stayed in . Again its the staff that make it special , but also a lovely spacious pool area , good food , nice rooms and a lovely ambience to the place .

 February 2016,5,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, facilities, service, and staff!","My girlfriend and I visited this hotel in early February and as this was our first time we did not know what to expect. BEWARE of the porters at the airport, they grab your case and demand money. Its easy to say no thank you, and they'll leave you alone. The hotel itself was fantastic! We were welcomed to a nice refreshing drink and checked in quickly. The manager was at hand to welcome the Thompson party to the hotel. Alberto is a friendly chap who ensured he engaged with all his guests, in the bar, around the resort, or at dinner! The hotel has free wifi which you can access by the pool or in the lobby!

The pool was massive and there was never an issue with getting sunloungers around the pool. The beach was also very clean. The food at the hotel was fantastic. Very fresh and authentic and always a great variety on offer. My wife is vegetarian and she always found something to eat. The drinks were all premium brands and wre quite strong.

 April 2016,5,"Stunning weather, immaculate hotel, second visit - consistently excellent.","If you used to visit Egypt for fabulous heat, excellent and affordable 5 star all inclusive holidays then you should visit here. We visited last Sept for 10 days & were in need of a quick 'fly & flop'. I'm not a fan of re-visiting the same places but he reminded me that it ticked all our boxes. Again really convenient transfer from the airport, swift check in late at night with supper. We've had 7 days of incredible weather, a couple of times a little light breeze so we've returned from the beach to the poolside for shelter.

The rooms were beautifully presented and cleaned to a very high standard everyday. The staff were very welcoming and very friendly. The food and beverage was excellent from start to finish, morning, noon and evening, excellent quality and choice. The location and facilities were excellent for all types of travellers and groups. Only negative was the wifi availability, this was accessible in the reception and by the pool (intermittently) but was not available in the hotel rooms. Overall superb holiday and very enjoyable. Thanks Rui Takida Palace Agadir.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,5,Beautiful Hotel,"Visited his wonderful hotel the middle of March with Thomson. Transfer was quick and easy and very professionally organised by the Thomson crew. We were quickly taken to our standard pool view room on the second floor which in our opinion is worth the extra amount. All the hotel is spotlessly clean, the food for an all inclusive is excellent with a wide choice at all times. For a picky eater like myself not once did I struggle to find something to eat in fact I looked forward to each mealtime. Sunbeds were never a problem to obtain they can be a little too close to next person especially if you like to turn the bed as the sun moves around. I only used the heated outdoor pool twice which was lovely and not crowded. Due to a mishap I could not use it after the second day or…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2015,5,Beautiful hotel,"We had our 1st holiday to the palace in August 2013 and we were so overcome with everything about the hotel that we also returned in August 2014 for another 2 week stay. I'm a very fussy person when it comes to cleanliness and I could not find fault at ll. We were upgraded to a suite on both occasions which added to our delight. This has got to be one of the best hotels that we have stayed in and the staff are so helpful and pleasant by far. The only negative thing I can say about agadir is the weather, which can be dull all day long with a cool breeze along with the agadir mist. We will definitely return to this hotel in the near future and would highly recommend it to those of you who are thinking of going to agadir.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,4,Great hotel - would give 4.5 if I could,"Overall the hotel is fantastic from the rooms to the staff. Great rooms and staff are very attentive and offer a great service Pools are great, so is the beach and is a very safe area. The only gripes I have is the lack of wifi in rooms. Secondly it does not cater fully for kids. We have a 18month and would have been nice to have kids cutlery etc at dinner. Even so it was a great week away and the hotel made it that way. Well done and can't wait to come again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,Amazing hotel! Would recommend!,"I came to stay here in the Easter holidays for some winter sun. The hotel is fantastic. From the minute we arrived we were greeted with cocktails and our luggage was taken off us. The room was huge with a living area, it had an amazing shower and 2 sinks! My only complaint would be the beds were hard! The room was cleaned every day and the fridge restocked with drinks. The best thing about this hotel was the food! There was so much choice and everything was so fresh. In the restaurant if you ordered wine you were given a bottle and staff were always filling up your glass! The hotel has a lovely pool area and there was always plenty of sun beds. No need to reserve. Ive stayed in plenty of hotels around the world and this is one of the best. I shall be going back next year!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Lie the first time the food was amazing, no queuing or fighting with other people to get the food. if you wanted your eggs cooked more they were happy to do that! - didn't have to fight for sunbeds which was lovely and if you wanted to come down at 2pm there was always a bed if not they would find you one. We stayed up one evening until 3am and they where still serving us drinks and olives taking pictures and having fun - I even went behind they bar and they taught me how to make cocktails! We visited the souk and brought loads! really friendly…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,3,Just so so,"Well, what had promised to be an amazing experience was not all that. We had emailed the hotel prior to arrival to request, if possible a quiet room, we ended up with one next to the cleaners room so lots of banging, talking and noise early in the mornings. The room itself, just the standard room, was extremely well appointed, very large, clean and plenty of space for two. Few issues with bathroom (toilet flush panel hanging off, light in toilet not working, light in main bathroom not working, no shower gel in dispenser),but these were quickly rectified. Pool experience .... and it was an experience! Literature from holiday company and signs around the pool stated that beds were not to be saved and was something RIU frowned upon, really? We witnessed numerous people popping…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,2nd visit definitely will be back,"We were here in August last year and had such a great time that we decided to return for a week, got home on Monday. The hotel management and staff throughout the hotel cannot do enough for you. The rooms are of a high standard, 3rd floor with view of the sea was great. The food was superb, drinks of a high standard, possecco very nice!!! The rooms are spotless as was the whole hotel. The shops opposite hotel are great and they like you to haggle with them. Visited the souk got some good bargains. Pure Passion restaurant in the marina is a must, they collect and return you which is nice. Thank you to everyone for a great holiday cannot wait to return.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,4,Pleasant suprise,"I am a little late in doing this review as we visited here in December, however we had such a lovely winter break. The people were so kind and friendly. The buffet was probably the best we have ever had. Fresh food being cooked in front of you. Great facilities, from table tennis, yoga, Pilates, gym, darts, boules the list goes on. Fantastic selection of branded drinks, from Bombay Saphire to Jack Daniels. Great value for money and a good holiday for all ages. This is a huge hotel and if you have difficulties in walking this may be an issue. I would avoid the rooms near the bar area as I'm sure it can be quite noisy. Highly recommend the suites with sea views. Pretty sure we will return with our teenage children.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,All inclusive that definitely works.,"This is one of the best hotels l have been to.From the reception and onwards you can see that everything is done very tastefully.The staff are superb and always friendly. I have been to some bad all inclusive hotels where they try their best not to give you a nice drink or good food.This hotel is the complete opposite as the all inclusive works brilliantly.At the lobby bar for pre dinner drinks,all branded,as soon as you have finished a drink you are asked if you would like another one.If l happened to say no l was asked ""why not""with a smile.The restaurant was excellant and the service second to none.The waiter at breakfast was upset when l went to get a pot of tea on my own and actually took it away and came back with one he had made,but always with a smile.

 April 2016,5,A great Spring Break!,"First visit to Morocco but it won't be my last! This reasonably priced break (for an all inclusive 5 star) did not disappoint on any level. Room: Clean, spacious, pool view worth the few extra pennies. Mini bar restocked every 2 days which is fine as drink is readily available. Food: Great! A selection to choose from at all meal times. Chefs out cooking fresh meat and fish during lunch and dinner. Personalised cooking available at breakfast too (although on a health kick I stuck to fresh fruit and a poached egg!) Staff: Friendly, attentive, eager to please at the bar. Area outside hotel: Promenade is beautiful...we walked to the Marina along the front which is just over 2km. Street sellers eager to sell, but a firm no thank you and it wasn't a problem. The beach is expansive…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,Amazing place for families (especially large ones),"We had the best week at the end of March. The staff could not be more accommodating and polite. There was plenty of choice in reference to what to eat and where to eat it. For us, being on the beach added to why it is an excellent place to go. We are new to the all inclusive idea and was nervous of canteen food and being ""penned in"" however it was totally the opposite. The food was excellent! We recommend sea view rooms and trips out to the Casbah Medina, the Souk of course and the marina. It would be a marvellous place for large extended families and we did see some there who capitalised on space and comfort and being waited on. Really do recommend it!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,5,Happy Happy Happy,"This was our third visit to this wonderful hotel. We visited for the first time in 2011 when the palace opened and this years visit did not let us down. It was like meeting up with an old friend. All the staff in the hotel work to make your stay special and the service we received from the staff was exceptional and impressed us just as it did the first time back in 2011. The waiting staff attend to your every need and never stop. At lunch times our table was ready for us every day with a waiting bottle of wine and water, nothing was too much trouble for Kahjida (?) who was 7 month pregnant!! She always had a smile for us. The hotel is excellent in every respect and we can not recommend it highly enough, I do know we will go for visit number four hopefully later this year.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2015,5,Truly spoiled by this hotel,"We absolutely loved this holiday and the hotel is to die for. Everything from the pool, rooms and restaurants were beautiful.

 April 2016,5,Very impressed,"We booked this holiday through Thompsons, after hearing excellent comments from friends who had stayed at the hotel. The hotel was very impressive. The design of the hotel was so spacious that it never felt crowded despite the number of people at the hotel. The standard rooms were massive and better than some suites that we have stayed in. The pools and lounging areas were well maintained and again so well designed that you never felt others were invading your space whilst sunbathing. The service of the waiting staff was brilliant. They were so attentive and observant, that we had no hesitation in tipping them; a gesture which they never expected or took for granted. Food was varied and well cooked. Plenty of fresh meat and fish cooked right in front of you and It was nice…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,5,Rui Palace probably one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.,"It's rare to walk into a hotel and find everything so perfect. From the welcome at reception to the staff at the bars, restaurant and evening entertainment, they made my stay special. There is a well equipped gym to burn off some calories, although I enjoyed going for a jog along the sea front, but be careful if you turn left and head towards the Kings palace, you will receive a stern warning to turn back. The food was to high standard with varying meals to accommodate all tastes, equally the drinks were branded quality which does make a difference. As for excursions, I did the Agadir experience which was a half day tour of Agadir, ending up at the central souk market, be prepared to be hasled, but barter for everything, expect to pay a third of the asking price if not less.

 April 2016,3,"Rather OK....problems (like always) with drunk UK ""tourists""","Hotel OK but after 3 nights we move to another room due to drunken (UK) neighbours that arrived in the room by 02.00am and then started to shout and singing till around 04.00 am. I will not tell you about the noise from 21.30 till 22.30 before they left for drinking. The problem is that you can drink around the clock and when people are undisciplined you get these kind of situations. Hotel knows about the situation.....answer : what can we do !? Was not the first time that we had such situation but this time it was like terror... We always travel to 5-star hotels and this we never had before.

Again we were hugely impressed that members of staff remember us from previous stays and treated us like old friends.

I was not very impressed with Agadir or the tours outside of the city but if you just want to stay around the pool and relax in great facilities this is certainly a good option.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,3,A story of two halves,"This hotel has the potential to be truly first class, however we were let down in too many areas to ignore. Negative: Reception staff: we had e mailed in advance (a month in advance) asking for a convenient room as we had a new born baby, so preferred quick access from the pool to our room. When we arrived we were put on the top floor, the furthest from the pool you could get. I understand you cannot satisfy all requests, however our request was not even acknowledged when we arrived. Not an apology that they could not accommodate our request. When our room key stopped working on 2 occasions we had to go all the way to reception to advise there was a problem. Not once did we get an apology or a reason. Then to top it off our little boy had an accident on the bed sheets, I…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,5,Wonderful stay !,"We were spontaneously back after two years and we are absolutely satisfied. Hotel management has changed and we are impressed with Mr. Alberto Abreu, who is looking all day long after guests and as well after his spectacular, hardworking staff. It's a great five star resort, which wouldn't be as it is if there was no engagement from the staff. We can only recommend.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,4,ALMOST perfect,"This hotel is stunning, it has great facilities, wonderful food and fabulous singers who entertain in the bar area. The only thing that lets it down is some of the service. My best friend and I stayed here last week and on the second night we had no towels in our room - we waited more than 2 hours for someone to bring them which was not acceptable. There were other examples of poor service but I don't want that to overshadow what was a great holiday. The weather was great at the end of March but you really do need a cardigan/jacket for the evenings.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,5,Sixth visit to this hotel and still amazing!,"We returned in March to this hotel and had another fantastic holiday. The exceptional service we received from the staff impressed us just as much as the first time we visited back in 2012. All the staff in the hotel work exceptionally hard to make each guest's stay special. The hotel is excellent in every respect and we can not recommend it highly enough. We love the interior décor of the hotel and the gardens are beautiful. The bedrooms are modern and impressive. The maids work tirelessly cleaning the rooms each day. The food is excellent with a huge variety to choose from. We love the speciality restaurants and would recommend booking these. The Krystal restaurant. the Marrakech restaurant and, in summer, the Italian restaurant are all excellent as well as the main buffet…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,4,"Lovely hotel, but 4 star and not 5 star","We stayed at the Riu Palace for 4 nights in March. We had a lovely time, the hotel has a lovely atompshere, and the food was nice too. Trip Advisor is correct to rate it as 4 star as it lacks the detail to be a 5 star. The hotel was not too busy and the it was lovely relaxing in the sun. I've outlined the pros and cons of the hotel below: Pros: - Lovely hotel, with a calm and relaxing atmosphere, and friendly staff - Very well decorated and spacious hotel - The rooms are large with seating area as well as balconies - Bathroom has his and hers sink and is modern, although the style of the room and bathroom is morrocan. - There is an abundance of food and drinks throughout the day, and all freshly cooked. The desserts are especially delicious. - Staff are very friendly towards…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2016,5,One Of the best Allinclusive and the Best RIU,"Excellent hotel, services, pool, rooms, food, animation ... everything. The rooms are large, clean and very comfortable. Food quality and variety is top class. Bar drinks quality can be improved as they are mediocre. the hotel is a prime choice for a mix of beach and town. Location is perfect. The beach is very good, large and clean. Even in terms of security we felt that is pretty safe to walk around and if not there is always a policemen or an soldier to tell you not to go the wrong place. My congrats to RIU and the full Riu Palace Tikida team!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

From the bar staff, waiters and waitresses in the restaurants to the reception and management and especially a big thank you to the excellent animation team , who , in our opinion , the best animation team anywhere. Each and every one of them is so friendly and make the days so much fun. They have time for everyone and nothing is too much trouble, even when you see them in the restaurant or around the hotel.

 March 2016,5,Excellent all round!,"We visited this hotel last November and had a lovely holiday. We returned in March and spent another lovely week of relaxation. We found the food in the buffet restaurant to be excellent, with loads of choice, even for the fussiest of eaters. We also thoroughly enjoyed the Moroccan restaurant and the Fusion restaurant, both of which you need to book for. Waiting staff in all the restaurants were friendly and gave service with a smile. Sun loungers are plentiful and always available. Pool attendants are on hand and will move parasols and beds to your preferred location. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean and gardens are kept well manicured. The Spa is beautiful and I would recommend a visit !

 February 2016,5,"Great Service, Lovely Hotel","Went here for a last minute holiday with one other adult. Cannot fault the spotless hotel. The service was great - and included waiter service at the pool. Not sure if this was just because it was off peak, but it was appreciated. Entertainment was ok. Was a bit too late starting at 9.30 pm but I assume this would be to accomodate the kids club in the summer. Food was very very nice. Lots of fish however. Dress code in most areas for men was long trousers however not many men did this and it wasn't enforced by the staff. Always an available lounger at the pool. One end of the pool is heated and the other isn't. Would definitely return",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We visited Agadir some years ago and was not impressed, however this holiday is up there with some of the best of this holiday type. We went for a week of relaxation and sun and this hotel and resort surpassed our expectations. The hotel is immaculate throughout, the food quality and variety is superb and the staff are amazing. Nothing is too much trouble for them and every detail catered for, The pool area is fabulous with comfortable loungers and plenty of them.

I usually tire of eating Buffet every day, but have to admit I didn't tire of the food after 10 days. There are 2 special restaurants although we never visited them (maybe next time). Also recommend the SPA - went for a hamamm and massage a couple of times. The wifi was actually pretty good in the reception area and the lunch restaurant. Try to get a room on the 4th floor",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2016,5,Absolutely fabulous,"Absolutely fantastic holiday. Read up on it 1st though. If like me you just want a relaxing holiday with nothing to do then this is the ideal place. But if you want bars & restaurants outside the hotel go somewhere else. Like so many other reviews, the staff were amazing, each & every one of them. Had no issues yeah the red flag was up every day, but still beat the English weather!!! It was the perfect holiday 7 days of pure bliss & will definitely be returning",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The room was well furnished throughout with sufficient drawer space although found that only 12 hangers provided for two people quite insufficient for our holiday. The room was of a good size with a comfortable seating area and a balcony with two chairs and a small table. There is also a laptop size safe which is provided FOC. Additionally a kettle plus tea and coffee provided together with 2x1.5ltr bottles of Still Water and 1x1.5ltr bottle Sparkling Water all of which are replenished daily.

Now this is an honest review that looks past the bottom of a wine glass or cognac glass. Upon arrival we received the welcome drink was nice and hotel seemed nice as well as staff. Checked in thoroughly but not shown our room! First night in hotel lounge bar had singer on which was OK but not fabulous as you will find out night after night of same songs. Entertainment at 930pm but always late and not really worth seeing unless Monday & Friday. Breakfast is OK but nothing special unless you want champagne to wash it down with. Service not bad but if you don't tip the staff they soon forget you! Also 3-4 waiters looking after table so many tips needed to get 5 star treatment! Lunch is…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2016,5,Absolutely first class.,We stayed at this hotel for the first week of March. Having read the reviews before we left we had great expectations and we were not disappointed. We had a standard twin room overlooking the pool area with a sea view which was very spacious. The beds were firm and very comfortable. There was a lovely bathroom with his and hers sinks and a really powerful shower. The room was cleaned every day to a high standard. The food in both buffet restaurants was excellent with plenty of choices to suit everyone's taste. We ate in both of the fine dining restaurants which were easily booked at the reception and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The pool area was stunning.

 March 2016,5,Bye bye winter blues,"After spending some time in the Riu Marrakesch I didn't had to high hopes. But I ended up loving this place. When we checked in we where offered a complimentary drink. I realise that this is a minor thing. This is a all inclusive hotel after all but still I loved the details. Combined with the smiles from the receptionist we immediately felt at ease. This may sound as nothing much but if you take the 'in your face' nature of the country into consideration let me tell you it's just what you need. During our stay the hotel was mainly host to middle aged French golfers. This made the whole experience all the more tranquil. Upsides; friendly and considered staff, reasonably good wifi (+10mbs), very clean and spacious rooms, proper alcohol especially for Moroccon standards,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Reception, bar and dining on 3rd floor so ask for 3rd floor for easily accessible rooms. There are lifts so easy to go down to the pool area. The pool is great even the 2nd pool was only slightly heated it was ok to swim in. Pool bar fab, with lovely staff, Noora was especially friendly. Sunbeds easily available and comfortable. Beach area was lovely, several sellers but a ""no thank you"" is usually enough to move them along and you are in a roped off area so they get fed up if you don't look interested.

Management are around at mealtimes and evenings to make sure holidaymakers are enjoying themselves and to ascertain whether there are any problems. The food is fantastic even for the fussy eater, if you have problems with your diet speak with head chef mohammed and he will cater for you at no extra cost.

Staff were friendly and accommodating, no problems finding a sun bed by pool, beach stunning and uncrowded, rooms large and spotlessly clean and food first class, with plenty of choice and variety. Didn't feel intimidated or threatened in any way on visits to Souk and fish market. Hired bike for 2 hours (cost about £2.50) and good way to ride along front to marina. Would have no hesitation in recommending hotel, particularly at this time of year when very few children around (escaping from 7 young grandchildren at home!!!) and will definitely be booking again, political situation allowing.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Try the Optmist cocktail to die for so fruity! Sent on the Thomson half day trip round agadir visited fishing harbour casbah Burgah museum and seouk the market's were massive and very interesting especially the fresh fruit and veg. There were spices galore. This was a fab winter sun destination and I will definately visit in the future. The manager of hotel Alberto even helped out suitcases on coach then came on and thanked us for choosing his hotel and visiting his country.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,4,Very pleasantly surprised,"We booked this for a spot of winter sun at a real bargain price through Thompson and we really were very pleasantly surprised. While the weather may not match Egypt for the heat we found Morocco better in just about every other way. The staff were good and the people generally very welcoming. We found some real bargains in the Souk and enjoyed the half-day that we spent there. Wherever we went we felt secure and unthreatened. The beach is magnificent and - at least in Feb/March - gloriously un-crowded. The rooms were large and the food not just plentiful but excellent and hugely varied. The only thing that stops me giving it 5 stars is that the towels could be fluffier, robes would top it off and the wi-fi (which is fine in the public areas) would be nice to have in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Well situated on seafront at Agadir enabling easy access to the boulevard alongside the beautiful sandy beach. From the hotel it is a nice walk along to the marina with plenty of cafes to stop off for coffee. Bikes can be hired at several point along the beach. The hotel also has its own private section of beach with plenty of su beds and umbrellas. Be aware the wind off the Atlantic can be a bit chilly, so good to pack a fleece or jacket. Rooms: are very spacious with good size bathrooms and a seating area with sofa. All have balconies.

We had a wonderful relaxing holiday on the first visit but this time things seemed to be even better. The food, although good the first time, was, we thought, even better on this visit. The fish is, in my opinion, a highlight and is both fresh and well cooked. A very minor thing, but I thought the coffee served at breakfast last November was a little bitter and poor. No such reservations now, coffee is good. The manager, Alberto, has a very high profile and is constantly seeking guests opinions and trying to improve the hotel - I think he is succeeding. It is a big hotel and therefore caters for a large number of guests but the service is very personal and there is always space to sit,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Both the beach and front entrance had security guards on standby. There was a free safe included with the room to store any valuables. If you chose to leave the resort and walk along the beach to the marina there was an armed guard presence. Weather The weather during the week was good. It averaged 21-26 degrees celsius during the day which we were happy with as it was warmer than England! Room We were in a twin room on the floor level with reception.

The room was spacious large bathroom with double sinks, power shower which was always really hot. A lovely balcony which got the sun almost all day.

This hotel, no trays of both but a small portion placed on blinis etc. However, in saying this, there was always something to please. I would also mention that the friendliness of the animation team (albeit all polite and lovely kids) were way out shined by the animation team in Marrakesh. Rooms: Absolutely beautiful.

We enjoyed 7 days of sunshine (staying in high 20s thought the week) beside the pool or on the beach, which is only a short walk across the promenade. The pool was clean and spacious. We never struggled to get a sunbed (which are also very clean and comfortable) and the complimentary towels were superb. The restaurants served a delicious range of food, you could eat from dusk to dawn at Tikida. I, myself, am gluten free and never once struggled to find something to eat.

Our families would have preferred more offerings of activities and sports classes, but those which we did were great. The room was nice and big, with ample room for a baby cot. Overall, the service was good but stands to be improved: we had a horrible arrival, with no one outside or inside to help with luggage, leaving me -- a lone parent travelling with an infant -- to manage with suitcases, a stroller and baby.

Pool The water was a little tepid which I really enjoyed as it can get quite hot relaxing on the sturdy wooden loungers whilst sipping G&T's (Bomaby Sapphire if you request it). I especially enjoyed the swim up bar in the main pool although I would say the service was a little slow and sometimes would be quicker to get out and walk to the other side of the bar but this spoils the moment. Food There is plenty of choice at any…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,"A Wonderful, Relaxing Stay","GENERAL TUI list this as a 5T resort, but in reality it is probably a 4* plus. I'm sure it genuinely was a 5* establishment when it was first built, but there are a few areas where the age is beginning to tell. That said, it is still a modern, clean and classy hotel which is clearly one of the best in Agadir. The hotel has three pools; 1 x heated indoor, 1 x heated outdoor and 1 x non-heated outdoor. STAFF This is an area in which the hotel really excels. According to the hotel management, there are 400 staff working in the hotel, although you could quite easily believe there were more as they were all extremely efficient and attentive. This is true regardless of whether a gratuity was given or not. FOOD & DRINK The food is generally excellent and I'm sure even the most…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,Amazing stay!!,"We just came back from hotel Rui palace Tikida Agadir, we stayed for a week and had a truly amazing time. We upgraded to a junior suite that was just WOW!! The food in hotel was fabulous as a fussy vegetarian I usually struggle but had 3 to 4 choices every night & if I couldn't find anything they would make me something eg omelette etc. The only bad meal was in The Krystal Restaurant it's meant to be a la carte but definitely not if we'd been paying for this meal we would of been very disappointed. Ate at the Moroccain restaurant and this was very good but buffet meals were just as good. Mohammed the barman was fabulous, very nice polite cheery guy!! We booked with Thomson and the rep Daniel was very informative. Our room was 4121 which facing opposite side from pool &…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Daytime temperature early to mid twenties but drops in the evening to around 15. Have been the last 2 years in the summer and will be going this summer as well. Hotel is still magnificent and the staff exceptional. Great communal areas, rooms and food. The manager, Alberto, is constantly making sure everything is exactly right and the staff work so hard and always with a smile. Thanks to both Rashid's,Younis,Redouan and the staff in the restaurants I forget. The entertainment team works hard and are always happy. Thanks to Yousef, Said, Adnan and Rasheed.

 February 2016,3,Definitley NOT a 5 Star,"I know a lot of people rave about this hotel, but having stayed at Rius all over the world & 3 other Rius in Morocco, not to mention 5 star hotels world-wide, I can speak from a position of authority when I say this is not a 5 star - 3.5 or 4 at best - and this view is also held by at least 5 other couples we spoke to during our recent stay there. There are also some very positive aspects of this hotel - mainly the staff - so to give a balanced review I will list both positives and negatives so people considering staying here can reach their own conclusions.So why not 5 star? Well, in every 5 star hotel I have stayed in, there have been bath robes, slippers, fruit, quality toiletries etc provided in the room - a turn down service is also standard at most, but not all, 5 star…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,Amazing place,"We, me, husband, 11 yr old son, 18 yr old daughter and her 22 yr old boyfriend spent a few days here in the middle of February. We had the most fantastic time, the lobby as you walk in was fabulous, big, comfy chairs all around and it took no more than 5 minutes to check in to two rooms, with a lovely alcohol free cocktail handed to us as we were at the reception.We were on the fourth floor with pool views and our luggage was brought up to us within minutes. The rooms were gorgeous, big beds and a large bathroom, extremely comfortable and large with a sofa bed down a step into the 'lounge' area. Our view was lovely, over the gardens and pools and we could see the sea and the kasbah on the mountain, just gorgeous. We didn't use the two a la carte restaurants as we were more than…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,A rare delight.,From start to finish this was a perfect holiday. We feel this hotel is well worth five stars plus. Everyone working there was really friendly. This was the best food we have had in one of these all inclusive hotels. Our drinks were always topped up without us asking for it. Our only downside was the difficulty we had getting any sugar free drinks for our mini bar but we're not going to knock off any points for the nicest hotel we've been in. The beach was lovely and quiet too. The hotel was also nicely located for a row of shops opposite. We will go back as our week wasn't long enough.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,Lovely,We had a wonderful time it was perfect. When we were checking out the man on reception asked how we were getting to the airport I said we will get the White taxi outside the hotel he said not to do that as he will call the courtesy car for us he insisted it will be here in ten min . When we got to the airport I handed the driver a tip he went mad with me and demanded 600 durum I told him to go away . We were then chased trough the airport and at security check in the driver had the police with him we were then made pay up .we were told at hotel reception that this trip was free it was not . This was a bad experience we will never go back to morroco . As I said earlier the hotel is perfect . This rip of driver drives a black sang yong.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,Fantastic Hotel and wonderful people,"My daughter and I stayed at the Riu Tikida Palace for a week in February 2016. I was a little nervous at the thought of two women travelling to Morocco alone, I had visions of being ignored or treated in some derogatory manner. How wrong I was! I have stayed in many Riu's, all over the world, and I can honestly say this is one of the most stylish and sophisticated I have ever visited. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the quality of fixtures and fittings is outstanding. The bar and restaurant staff are friendly and cheerful without being overpowering, the reception staff are wonderful and help with whatever problem you many have. The rep, Dan, was amazingly attentive and really cared about everyone, and the entertainment staff were some of the most professional, kind…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,Fabulous resort for luxury and relaxation,"This was our first time at Riu Tikida Palace, and also our first time in Morocco - we had a fantastic time. We felt very safe on this resort and very welcome by all staff. We couldn't have asked for a better resort, my husband and I go on luxury 5 star all inclusives for every holiday and I have to say this was our best experience yet. All of the hotel staff are very hardworking, very friendly and hospitable, and also good fun. We were SO well looked after by everyone in this hotel - from the Manager (who was very present throughout our stay), the bar and waiting staff, the pool staff, the fitness team and also the housekeepers. We ended up hugging the staff at the end of most nights as they looked after us as if we were their own family. This hotel is beautiful, so clean and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,4,Lovely holiday with kids,"We had a lovely stay just before Christmas for 5 nights. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, especially all the pool and outdoor lounging areas. We loved relaxing on the many couches or sunbeds scattered around the pools or throughout the hotel and lobby. Our favorite thing was to grab a coffee by the pool and just relax in the sun. The two outdoor pools were fairly cold (even the ""heated"" one) but there is an indoor pool that was quite warm and we spent most of our time swimming in that with our 2 young boys (2 and 5). There is a kids club as well and a small playground for kids within the kids club though we didn't really use it. The staff were all very friendly and everyone spoke English fairly well. Just a heads up in case you have shy kids like ours, the staff can…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our rep Dan was very friendly and helpful. We will be back in September.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,"Fantastic, luxury hotel on the seafront in Agadir","This was our second stay in a Riu hotel in Agadir. The first, at the Tikida Dunas, was wonderful but the Tikida Palace is way ahead in luxury and class, very well worth the extra money. The hotel is superb, luxurious and comfortable, the rooms sumptuous, the included food and drinks of very high quality and variety. The service was impeccable; polite, attentive and friendly, without ever being too much. The facilities, bars, restaurants, gym, activities, pools, sunning and relaxing,etc. were what one would expect at such a hotel. The only, very minor, criticism is that the food in the Moroccan themed restaurant was (surprisingly) bland and uninteresting. An incredible hotel for the money and an incredible, relaxing holiday.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,4,Winter Sun at the Palace,"It was our first experince of a Riu hotel and we were not disappointed. On arrival we were welcomed with a drink and throughout the holiday the staff were friendly and attentive. Our room was at the back of the hotel which was quiet and comfortable but got no sun. There was a plumbing problem when we first arrived but a call to Reception quickly resulted in a handyman appearing and the problem fixed. The food was excellent and there was a huge choice. However, the dining room struggled to cope with the large numbers of guests on occasions, resulting in frazzled serving staff and queues for hot water for tea/coffee. Also a shortage of tea pots! Most of our day was spent by the pool, which was heated in January. There were plenty of sun beds and umbrellas and pool towels were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Must say 2 hours on a camel was a bit long! Try one hour. Used them to explore Agadir and guide excellent. The Hotel was clean, tidy and all staff very attentive but not intrusive - well the animation team could have been if not ignored! Huge variety of food. Just need to be a little patient at times as lots of people and not very good traffic management. Pool area clean and tidy and always being attended to. The heated outdoor pool a bonus. There is an indoor pool as well and many other activity centres. Had sun each day, although wind could be cool at times (out of the control of hotel of course). Beach huge and in summer would have had potential.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2016,5,Best winter Riu break yet!,"Stayed for a week over Feb half term with our daughter (9 yr). Having had several winter breaks in Riu hotels this is best & most luxurious yet. It is difficult to find any real faults. Weather was great for our week (late 20s) and given that the hotel caters for 1200 guests and 800 were in residence sun loungers were never a problem and the hotel had a very relaxed ( but not stuffy) feel. Although I enjoyed swimming lengths in the cold pool, the 'heated' outdoor pool is a massive bonus and kept our daughter happy and occupied. As previously mentioned the hotel guests were mainly French and from UK and everyone mixed well. From previous Feb breaks in Morocco we knew there wouldn't be a large number of children from UK but there were enough for our daughter to make friends…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

All were spotless. 4 of us on the 2nd floor roomsoverlooking the pool heard furniture being moved above but these rooms, 2024 and 2026 (this one had a massive balcony) were perfectly placed for all the amenities. Probably 4026 on the 4th floor would be perfect ! The 2 rooms facing the street on the 4th floor had views of the mountains and the sea. The food and service were superb throughout our stay. We celebrated 2 birthdays and on both we were given cake and prosecco. We tried both a la carte restaurants but although the service was good, we found the food disappointing.

There was no problem with branded drinks and yes the beers are small but I just asked for two or even three and the staff were more than happy to oblige. I never tried the specialty restaurants as the buffet was so good and I mean really good. I was speaking to the manager who said they have 1100 sun beds, if you can't find one the pool attendants will get you one, such a relief not to worry about getting up early to find one. Pork sausages and bacon (albeit not the best cuts) available at breakfast. If you ordered wine they leave the bottle, if you ordered Diet Coke from a bottle rather than the tap then that's fine as well.

It's true that there were not many theme nights like at other all inclusives but having said that, for the week we were there I didn't eat the same thing twice. There was always pizza, pasta etc but the other options varied each night. The entertainment team were brilliant but not pushy if you didn't want to do any activities. The hotel had a spa attached but I never once saw anyone trying to sell its services (unlike other places we've stayed where you get approached loads by staff trying to sell treatments). I didn't visit the 2 restaurants and we only went to one show, which was given by entertainers from outside the hotel so I can't really comment on those. However the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Hotel boutique shop is very reasonably priced if you forget any toiletries they stock it all and for that last minute shop for presents and souveniers.

If you're not already extra-close with your partner, you're about to be... The staff were some of the kindest and eager to please I've ever come across and seeing the hotels manager mucking in at the bar was great.

The hotel itself reminded me of some of the 5 star hotels you find in Nusa Dua Bali with its impressive foyer looking out towards the sea over palm trees - but without the hassle of an 18 hour flight or expense. Bedrooms were spacious with good bathroom facilities. Pool and communal areas were expansive and well maintained. Gym was adequate but would benefit from some new machines, including benches and rowing machines. Food on the whole was fantastic with a great selection on offer, including tagines and local delicacies at each meal.

There were a few little things that niggled me, which is why I didn't give the hotel 5 stars, so I will start with those and go onto the good stuff last...

Bed wasn't the best - two singles shoved together. Be warned - bring mosquito spray; they got in our room and bit us all night. The public areas are impressively done and beautiful. The food was very very good quality for this type of holiday with the exception of the speciality restaurants which we felt were actually poorer than the buffets. Of particular note are the salads and the Moroccan specials which are available every day. The pool area is very nice, although we didn't use the pool itself - far too cold for us.

 January 2016,5,Exceeded all expectations!,"Having never been on an all-inclusive holiday, I was a little apprehensive of what to expect but I have to say, staying at Riu Palace Tikida was the best holiday I have ever had! Firstly, the hotel is fabulous - it is very big and as soon as you walk in, you are greeted by a grand reception area and very friendly staff. We were checked in very quickly and had our bags brought to our room by a porter within about 10 minutes. We were in room 1006 which was on the ground floor, right next to the lunchtime restaurant and had our own terrace which was lovely to use in the evening. The room was very spacious, clean and the shower was fantastic. My only gripe would be that the beds were very firm which did disturb both my husband and I's sleep (but this may be due to personal…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,5,Excellent staff,"Just returned from this hotel and most outstanding point that make this hotel a 5 star is the staff. The front-of-house staff are extremely helpful, always smiling and smartly dressed (just wish some of the guests were and adhere to the dress code). I must also say thank you to the behind-the-scenes staff (chefs,cleaners,laundry staff etc. who must work very hard to maintain the high standard of the hotel. The weather was far better than expected - hot and sunny everyday, which meant lots of swimming (heated pool) and sunbathing. Plenty of sunbeds available around the pool so no need to reserve any. The animation team work hard to ensure you enjoy yourselves and we joined in many outside activities and met some very nice French, German and Belgium guests. In general I would find…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,"Brilliant hotel, brilliant staff, brilliant holiday","From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the staff cannot do enough for you. I took my mum away for her birthday and stayed here from the 16/11/15 to the 24/11/15. On arrival we received a lovely pina colada which we very much enjoyed. Checked in to find there wasn't wifi in the rooms so couldn't connect my laptop but the receptionist came to our room to hand me an Ethernet cable to use through out the stay which we appreciated. There wasn't a day that went by we weren't catered for in the food and beverage department, definitely 5 star food, drink and service there. Pool area is huge, kept very clean and tidy with plenty of sun beds to go around. Rooms were massive also finished with nice furnishing and a live bathroom complemented with a brilliant power shower. 2…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 February 2016,5,Great Morrocan holiday hotel,"We have just returned from a 2 week break at the Riu Palace Tikida and would recommend this to go for a great holiday. We have stayed there before and always thought it was good but on this latest stay it was even better. The facilities are always clean and tidy and the food selection is impressive and met all our requirements. The thing that made this holiday so special was the way the staff look after your every needs, nothing is too much trouble for them and all is done with a smile on their face. Will definitely be returning again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,5,Best value for money we have ever spent on a holiday,"Booked last minute to get a bit of winter sunshine. What an amazing hotel, how they give such a fantastic service for the price paid is quite honestly astonishing. From the moment we arrived to the day we left, we had nothing but first class service, food, drinks, accommodation and what delightful staff work there. We will definitely be going back. Our friends recommended it and they have just booked to go again. Thank you everyone at Riu for making us so welcome, now on drastic diet as the food was so good we ate far too much!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,1,MONEY AND CREDIT CARDS STOLEN FROM OUR ROOM,"we booked our trip with Thompson who in there brochure say you have 24hr cover you have not so beware if your trip goes well that's fine but if not do not expect a representatives support you will not get it even though they say they provide it in there brochure they do NOT. They ignore emails from you when you return home!!! The hotel is ok to be honest They did not give you any branded drinks like advertised and the entertainment was on the cheap and very boring, repeated in the second week it was not worth seeing in the first week let alone the second But our main issue was Money stolen from our room, My wife is certain she put the items in the safe and the safe had been opened £120.00,two credit cards and 200.00 in there money we had thousands of pounds worth of other…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,an amazing hotel and great staff,"we actually stayed at The Riu Palace Tikida Agadir the first week of November 2015 after our friends had stayed there several times and invited us along. We werent disappointed - everything was as they had described from the fabulous all inclusive food and drink package (which included branded drinks),fab cocktails and the staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough for you. I can't say enough good things about the hotel , its so lovely and right on the beach too. if you get a bit stir crazy you can walk along the vast promenade,or take a taxi to the huge souk,where we had a most enjoyable day shopping- or take an evening stroll around the harbour at the end of the promenade where there are plenty more shops and restaurants.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,5,Excellent week of great weather and very good hotel,"Booked late and main criteria was temperature, value and not long haul. Really really pleased with choice. Possibly one of the best Riu Palaces and we have tried quite a few. Room was top notch (and just a regular room but pool view), food was great. All staff from animation to waiters, pool guys, room staff and groundstaff were friendly and chatty. A bit of schoolboy french goes a long way in Morocco . Drinks were all OK or even more than OK. Enjoyed lovely long outdoor lunches where wine was served by the bottle. Unlike earlier reviewers who appreciated this so they knew how little they were drinking, i liked the fact that one bottle was swiftly replaced by another...Class..The Rose was particularly good Like others it would have been nice if Gordons gin etc that was clearly…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,5,Winter Holiday,"A lovely hotel set in lovely surroundings nice spacious bedroom staff were nice and friendly. The food in the restaurant was nice, the only downside was go in early or late to miss the rush and the bar staff saw to your every needs the entertainment was more like butlins entertainment and in the restaurant all the chefs can do was crack a egg but it was not a smile",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,4,ANOTHER GREAT HOLIDAY BUT.........,"Our fifth visit. We had two glorious weeks (9 – 23 January) with warm sunny weather which was a real bonus. There were one or two niggles which is why I’ve only awarded 4 stars. Having booked a sea-view Junior Suite we were delighted to receive an upgrade to a full suite - luxury in the extreme! Large bedroom, spacious living room (TVs in both), usual lovely bathroom with bath and walk-in shower, WC and twin hand basins, a second separate WC, and a good sized dressing room where wardrobes and safe were situated in addition to a fair sized entrance lobby. Both rooms had patio doors opening onto the massive balcony with table, chairs and sunbeds. There were two sliding doors between the rooms which provided good sound proofing should one of us want to sleep whilst the other…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,4,Not quite the same,"We stayed in January last year and returned again in January this year. Nothing had changed, lovely hotel, wonderful staff, all seemed as was. We noticed things changing during our stay. First to go was the orange juice, apparently the Deputy Manager told his staff that it could not be served with the coffee, never mind asking the guests! I always start my breakfast with orange juice.. The next day the bottle wine left on the table was vetoed. With a bottle on the table we know exactly how much we have drunk and at what speed we drink it, previously the bottle was opened at the table and left, under the new DM regime the bottle disappeared and a bottle re-appeared to top us up. The DM patrolled the dining room inspecting knives and forks and wines glasses, surely this should be…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We decided that we will go on the 1st December and stay till the 26th January (8 weeks) to get away from all the bad weather in the UK. We have stayed at the Riu Palace Tikida many times before but not for the Festive Season. We must say that we enjoyed ever minute of our holiday and the Christmas and New Year Gala Dinners were something beyond our expectations. The Animation Team put on some good shows throughout our stay, and the resident singer Rachid and Youseff provided music on a regular basis. Rachid also played with the band on stage for all to dance to if they wanted. During our stay we met many friends we had made over the years. This Hotel gets repeat guests on a regular basis and many…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2016,4,Return visit to this very good Hotel,just back from another very enjoyable two week holiday at Tikida Palace.... Two weeks of above average temperatures ... Even warm enough for breakfast on outside terrace which was much more peaceful than the main restaurant. Our room was as requested previously by email and we had a sunny balcony everyday. Service at this hotel is first class and the standard of cuisine excellent... Improvements of hot plates and food made all the difference. I found sunbeds easily and the pool attendants very helpful. The Aqua gym everyday was still very much a feature although gets a little tiresome with the same music. The animation team very friendly and their breakdancing skills were amazing. A very relaxing winter break ..like to think we will return again one day.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

My wife and I just loved every thing about the hotel, would find it very hard to fault any thing, only if we were being extremely picky. every member of the staff work so hard at pleasing you, and do not want tips or rewarding for it, they are genuinely pleased to help you. the only thing that could have spoilt our holiday was the behaviour of one or two of the guest(English and French) no manners what so ever. If I could put every member of the staffs name on here I would, but a little mention to Rahiiiiiid,Yousaf,AnaSs,IIhame,Tarik,Rachid (frank Lampard) ,Abdo,Said,Adnan,Amal,Wapa.and any one who I have missed for making our stay so pleasant and we love you all.

Hair dryer , mini bar , ironing board . The pool and beach are also nice but didn't spend much time there as I'm. Not a keen sun bather . The food in the other hand I found very poor . The same food everyday consisted of a salad bar , dessert counter with the same desserts everyday then you have a pizza and pasta counter which had 4 different pizzas , spaghetti , fusilli , bolognais sauce .

 August 2015,5,Amazing place food and location,"This hotel is just amazing as it became a reference for me and my wife. Whenever we go to a place we compare it to our stay in this great palace. We stayed in all inclusive deal for 10 nights; we were very surprised we didn’t get fed up with the place. The quality and diversification of the buffet was artistic, the food was always available. The hotel offered thematic buffet every two days, we had the Asian, Moroccan days. The staff is polite and super proactive, thumbs up to the management, this place is running like a Swiss watch. The rooms and the pool are awesome, the rooms are super well decorated and very large, for the pool it had a bar in it “big and super clean”.

 January 2016,4,Beautiful Hotel,"Just returned from 10 days at the Riu Palace and found it to be beautifully laid out, very clear and the staff were very friendly. The food in the dining room was, on the whole very good, although there were nights when you seemed to be eating the same as you did the previous night. Disappointed with the Krystal a la carte restaurant, we went there twice, the first night we asked for the steaks to be medium but when they arrived they were very rare. The second time we went I had the fish which was very dry with no sign of a piece of lemon or any type of dressing. Even in the snack bar at lunchtime there is lemon and tartar sauce for the fish, which all seemed to be lacking in the Krystal. In its defence, however, I must say that the chocolate soufflé was very nice as was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,5,Great,"All staff were extremely friendly, helpful and attentive.

 December 2015,5,Great New Year's Eve Party. Improvements on last year,"Stayed for New Year this time instead of Christmas. Had an excellent holiday last year but this was better. The hotel was extremely clean throughout and cleaning was ongoing throughout the day in the public areas. Entertainment this year was very good. We are not normally ones for hotel entertainment or shows but the live band and dancers were well above normal standards. Joined in the daily aqua exercises in the pool this year. We are regular gym goers and I was a little sceptical about the exercise but this was a good workout, especially the boxercise part where the water gives more resistance. Quite a few men joined in over the 10 days we were there and it is worth having a go. As ever, more than enough sunbeds, food was very good and the staff/service excellent. No problems…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,5,Another super Christmas,"Visited the Palace for a third Christmas in a row and again thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The hotel was extremely busy in 2014, but I guess security worries dictated a drop in numbers this time. Anyway the staff were as friendly and helpful as ever and the variety of food was excellent. Last year it was hard to get a drink at the bar after dinner but this time there seemed to be more drinks waiters on duty. Again we were blessed with superb weather which meant plenty of time spent around the pool. We walked the lovely beach every day and never felt in danger at any stage.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our first impressions were great as we were greeted with a cocktail and friendly staff, helping us check in. Our room was lovely, very modern decor with a view onto the street at the side of the hotel, the sea in view slightly. Towards the end of the stay markets opened on said street and people were singing and dancing outside which was nice. We had a cute little balcony which had sun when you wanted it and shade at night.

We chose the Tui Platinum five star Riu Tikida Palace in Agadir. We have stayed in Agadir quite a few times over the years and have used cheap hotels and apartments, but this time pushed the boat out and went upmarket. We were not disappointed as the Tikida was beautifully appointed with one of the best appointed rooms or mini suite, we have ever stayed in. First class food and drink in an all inclusive setting. A wonderful leisure area with a good number of pool guys and a huge number of beds, towels and mattresses. The week flew by leaving us wishing to return again.

Unbelievable value at £380pp which included flights, transfers and full all inclusive in the hotel. The hotel is rated 5* and that's hard to disagree with. The food laid out for each meal was just amazing, and I would defy anyone to say they couldn't find anything they fancied! Also excellent provision for vegetarians, with huge array of salads, eggs, cheeses, breads, dips. And the sweets.... just out of this world. The room we had was large and spacious, with seperate bathroom, toilet and dressing areas, and a nice sitting area leading onto a balcony.

Food was also quite nice. Staff on the front line (not management) were lovely and obviously were very experienced in the service industry such as bar staff, restaurant staff and cleaners. Issues arose when we visited the beach for a second time (the beach was sectioned off for RIU guests only with their sun loungers and wooden parasols). the wood parasols had hooks to hang possessions which we did. yet upon collection my dress and bag, they were marked with what looked like creosote and we were informed…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The main buffet was better than the 2 a la carte restaurants. Possibly not a 5 star experience but still excellent value for money for some winter sunshine & the golf courses were easily accessible.

I was so taken by the hotel, its atmosphere, its staff, its welcome, and what they informed me was on offer. I would have loved to stay, but for this time it was a little too expensive than I had budgeted for. Reception was courteous, friendly, cheerful and informative. Hotel look was fantastic Rooms were superb. Pools were vast and inviting. The beach was irresistible, seeing it from outside on the promenade. Their program catered fro all.

The hotel was excellent, the staff great and the food in the main hall was brilliant. The extra effort made by the hotel staff and the Thompson reps to make the birthday celebrations memorable made it all perfect! The hotel manager was always visible and keen to ensure all enjoyed themselves here whilst making you feel reassured with good security. Only criticism was the Krystal a la carte which really needs to improve. The food was cold and little extra to give that a la carte experience.

The NYE festivities were really good and the animation team work really hard and put on a great show with some excellent break dancing! There were good fireworks by the beach but they didn't start until 12.30 and this looked like it was at a bar half way up the promenade. There is a large selection of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner and all that I had was excellent. The only beer is Flag (5.2%) which is pretty decent, wine was pretty good too and they always gave you the bottle at dinner. Branded spirits available.

The Gala Buffet on New Years Eve was better than going to many English a la carte restaurants. The staff were so helpful and friendly and nothing was a problem for them.

An absolutely mind boggling selection of food on offer at seemingly all times of the day and night. Hideous entertainment, which I must say all the other guests enjoyed. A wonderful outdoor pool and spa facility. Loved the staff, who were always so friendly and happy to help - they must have the patience of saints dealing with horrendous tourists 24/7.

 December 2015,5,Very nice!!,"This hotel is the best in agadir. Had a great location right on the promenade and private beach. We went for a short break ( 4 nights). The room we had was a big suite with a massive balcony and partial sea view. There was a huge outdoor pool and heated indoor pool. My one problem with this was the indoor pool was shut by 6pm and we think it should be open till later on in the evening. We went all inclusive and the food was better than expected, just lovely, there was alot of variety.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,4,Exquisite hotel,"This hotel really is a cut above the rest. The staff are lovely and had direct dealings with the Assistant Manager Alberto who is a real pleasure to liaise with. Always good to see Management mingling and ensuring guests are happy. Only reservation about this hotel was the gym / fitness centre. Good size space but lacks any free benches and several basic machines to train with. Other than that hotel is in a great location, friendly staff all inclusive, Cant really ask for more.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,5,Great Holiday,"What an amazing get away for great weather in winter, with temperatures hitting 28 degrees. the staff at the hotel were absolutely wonderful and work very hard especially the bar in the lounge. The animations team really tried getting involved by offering you some of the free activities the hotel offer and made you feel welcome. A big shoutout to Brother Ahmed who was so helpful all the time and made sure you felt like home. A great place for a family holiday with 2 pools indoor and outdoor and all is paid for as it is inclusive. Great Holiday! Can't wait to visit again!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2016,3,Could be better .. Such a shame ? Average 4 star all inclusive,"Hotel experience overall was good, but don't expect 5 star luxury. The rooms are tired and need refurbishing. Went with Thomson on Platinum lifestyle, have done several platinum and a la carte hotels with Thomson as I am surprised this hotel has made the grade. In my opinion (Ex Thomson rep) this is an average 4 star facility. Don't expect luxury. Food generally good, thou a la carte restaurant poor service. All staff work hard",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,5,A Palace re-visited New Year 2016,"Another fantastic stay at the Palace 28th December for New Year. Thanks again for a fabulous time, we felt like royalty my husband and I. We loved it so much in April we thought we would try New Year. What a great week to choose, the hotel, the staff, the rooms, the food & drink the weather. We both came back with a great suntan and a larger waist. Nothing much more to say as everyone that visits the hotel has said it. Excellent holiday cannot wait to go back, thanks again Riu.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,4,Very Nice but not 5 star.,"Me and girlfriend came for 10 days in early December via Thomsons. For what we paid, this was probably the best value all inclusive trip we have ever been on, or likely to go on. It was so cheap we couldn't not go. The hotel Is lovely. Very spacious. Very well kept and the staff are very friendly and attentive. We saw many a couple ( usually in their 50's + ) gushing over the staff and crying as they left and thanking the staff for all their help. We were well looked after, but not so that I felt the need to cry on my departure! Our room was large. Very dark though and oddly did not have an area my girlfriend could do her hair ( straighteners ) in front of a mirror as all the plug sockets were miles away. It was kept clean and the mini bar was topped up every other day.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,5,New Years Blast,"This was our second trip to Morocco but our first to Agadir. On arrival we were greeted with a refreshing glass of non alcoholic juice, check in was painless with clear instructions regarding restaurants, breakfast, bars etc. Reception staff are always more than keen to help and can provide information on taxis, souks, trips, local restaurants, etc. Money exchange is also provided at a good rate. You have to ensure that you are in your room for bag drop off, which can take up to a half hour or more. There are 5 bars and 4 restaurants in the hotel, 2 bars around the pool area with the swim up bar open during warmer months, although it was an average of 25c while we were there, it was chilly when you got out of the pool. Obviously there are restrictions on opening times. The pool…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It is well maintained and spotlessly clean! The room was spacious, modern and we had a lovely view of the beach and mountains. The views were stunning! The staff are very welcoming and provided outstanding customer service! The food was delicious with good variety in the buffet restaurant. There are also two a la carte restaurants which were luxurious and posh. The drinks were branded and served with generous measures which was a result! At the hotel they had great entertainment throughout our stay. (day time and evening.)

The lobby and rooms are luxurious, modern and immaculately clean. There is a mini bar in the room (filled up daily). There is an excellent variety of food and the quality is very good. Good choice of drinks with branded alcohol. The staff were outstanding and treated us like royalty. Alberto (manager) even loaded our cases onto the coach when we were departing. Pool area is stunning (plenty of sunbeds). Other points to note are that at reception you can obtain Moroccan currency, the beach is fantastic and even the entertainment during the day/evening was great. The only negative point is that there was a few marks on the wall in…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,4,Good all round winter sun hotel!,Booked a winter sun trip to Morocco and stayed seven nights all inclusive.

 December 2015,5,Christmas in Morocco,"We chose Agadir (and this hotel having checked trip advisor) having had our Egyptian holiday cancelled due to recent events. Two adults and two boys 14 and 11 yrs old, we were pleasantly surprised having some mixed reviews from friends. The staff can't do enough for you in all areas of the hotel a 30p 50 dirham tip gets you even more attention. Food was always varied with mixed meat fish, vegetable dishes the kids were always catered for with pizza pasta burger chicken and chips. Drink was a mixture of local beer and name brand spirits the lager was really good for an all inclusive holiday. The local wine was very good red and white and you were given the bottle at lunch and dinner times.

 December 2015,5,Amazing Christmas break,"This was our first visit to Agadir and our first Christmas away. What can I say that hasn't been said already. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and very ornate, (if a little dark!)The rooms are huge and are kept spotlessly clean by the cleaning ladies. The staff were all excellent and nothing was too much trouble. Special mentions must go to the entertainment staff particularly Annan, Rasheed,Yosef ,Sayeed and Adnan who kept me laughing all week The beach directly outside the hotel is beautiful, however we couldn't swim in the water because it was very rough. ( Not sure wether this was a seasonal thing or not) Also the beach is patrolled by armed guards which was kind of reassuring but at the same time disturbing. All in all we had a fantastic holiday and met some very…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Staff are remarkable and all are very attentive polite and look after your every need. Rooms are spacious and clean. The food is plentyful and you won't starve it's not repetitive there is live cooking stations something different each night. You also get a night in krystal fusion restaurant and Moroccan restaurant both exceptional. You can always find a sun bed and if not pool staff will help you.

Nothing was too much trouble, practically everyone we came in to contact with went out of their way to may our stay enjoyable. The hotel is spacious as are the rooms - we had a second floor pool view that had a lovely aspect. Personally wouldn't like to be in a ground floor as they were quite dark. Enjoyed the food which seems to be rotated on a weekly basis so the second week you know what to expect. Plenty of fruit, choice and some wicked deserts. Restaurant staff were all very welcoming and assisted by dad (aged 88) in so many ways he felt like royalty. The Christmas Eve dinner was extravagant and thoroughly enjoyable. Drinks were varied and included cocktails, imported spirits, a good range of mocktails and non alcoholic drinks. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

As soon as you walk into the Hotel you become a silhouette with your shadow hovering in an infinite abyss of mahogany. Reception: Very prompt, friendly and attentive. Lots of pleasant smiles and a special thank you to Yassine was exceptionally pleasant in his service. They served a lovely drink upon arrival and check-in was seamless despite the influx of guests. Rooms/Cleaning/Sleep: The rooms were very clean and huge. As per previous comments, the footsteps on the floor above are quite annoying.

I did not have or even notice a single negative experience with regards to their conduct - a big compliment! The general upkeep of the place is spot on and everything is spotless.

 December 2015,4,"Exemplary customer service, great hotel","Stayed here for one week in mid December and found the place to be first class on almost every level. Check in was quick and easy, rooms are very large and although we had considered upgrading to a suite this was not necessary as there was a separate seating area which was more than adequate for our needs. Large changing and bathroom space and room was well maintained. Mini bar available which was restocked with soft drinks every day, apparently beer was also an option but not one we took advantage of. Ice machines in the corridors were useful. If sunshine on your balcony is important let them know and you will if available be allocated a room on the side of the hotel which benefits our room was not a sunny one but this was perfect for us.

 December 2015,5,Second time still excellent.,"Went back for ten days this year as felt cheated last year with only going for seven. Saw many of the same people as last year so this Hotel gets a good repeat business. Weather was far better than last year and we had wall to wall sunshine. We didn't take enough summer clothes !! However people were still walking round wrapped in body warmers and scarves wish we knew which part of the world they came from as we could go there on holiday if it is so hot this time of year! The aircon was only on for a couple of hours a day and the rest of the time the heating was on so it was rather warm to sleep in. All other reviews give you the low down on the food, drink and rooms so don't really feel the need to repeat it all.

 December 2015,5,Impressive,"This was our second visit to the RIU Palace Tikida this year and our impressions were as good as when we first visited. The ambience of the large reception area and the high quality furnishings exceed expectations. We noticed on our visit this time that the hotel was not full which could be seen by the amount of sun beds not taken up, however, the Brits were still in force placing their towels on the sun beds before breakfast. The food was varied and great quality, yes it was a bit on the warm to cold side at times, unfortunately, with the hotel not operating at full occupancy the turnover of the food such as vegetables, pasta etc was sometimes slow. Overall, an excellent hotel with great friendly staff",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Branded top spirits as well... The entertainment was good and the rock band with an excellent front man who also sang in the bar was much better than we expected, they could play anything and did. we had some real fun in the pool with Hamada who did the aqua gym/aerobics every day, he was so good, very funny but 40 minutes of high intensity non stop exercise was just the job...The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

This trip was a milestone birthday treat for my wife & from the moment we arrived we knew we had made a great selection. The split level room was well laid out and gave our son the privacy he needed. The selection and standard in all the hotels restaurants was top class. The Riu Palace is situated on one of the most impressive promenades I have ever seen. And a short stroll across the prom is Agadirs wonderful beach. Agadir itself is a quaint town & has a great cafe culture. Finally, I want to praise the hotels staff.

Found the evening entertainment adequate but limited such as dance shows, magic shows etc. no kids disco which was disappointing but very few kids despite being half term. Still you get the hugging n puffing of adults who expected a kids free hotel despite advertising a kids club and being half term!!

We had a wonderful suite overlooking the sea and would strongly recommend. The only downside is the distance from the main areas of the hotel as my husband has walking problems but he did get his exercise! It is a family hotel and from a personal point of view we would prefer adults only. It is beautifully furnished, especially in the large lounge area but a little dark. Pool area excellent and can easily cope with large numbers of people. No wifi in rooms, only in public areas. I would highly recommend Agadir, it has improved since we were there six years ago. You just have to be aware of the sellers along the promenade.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Check in was friendly and efficient whilst enjoying a welcome drink and we were soon in our very impressive and spacious room. The rooms are on 2 levels and very spacious and well appointed. The furnishings are again high quality. We had a pool view on the sunny side of the hotel. Looking towards the sea the pool view rooms to the left would not have got much sun.

The food was probably the best choice we've had in an all inclusive hotel abroad. The staff were all really helpful, friendly and genuinely nice people. From the lads who helped with your sunbeds every day to the restaurant staff, nothing was too much trouble. A lot of the guests had come back several times to this hotel and we could understand why, we are definitely talking about our next visit!

 November 2015,5,Fantastic holiday,"Stayed at the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir between 19/11/2015 to 03/12/2015. The service received during the stay was fantastic. The room was kept spotless and the minibar replenished regularly. The hotel staff could not do enough for us, and remembered us from our visit last year. Although the hotel is all inclusive we did try eating out at local restaurants which was not that expensive. An example of cost is around 130 dihrams for a fillet steak which is less than £10 (value for money) We will denifinately be returning to this hotel at some point.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,5,First Visit,My wife and I have just returned from a 2 week holiday in Morocco staying at the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The rooms are big and airy all have air con and ceiling fans large beds and a lounge area and fridge (filled up every other day) All the staff are very helpful and friendly nothing is too much trouble. The dinner and lunch (near the pool) restaurants have plenty of choice many fish meat dishes. There are 2 speciality restaurants both well worth a visit. Visits are restricted and must be reserved in advance. We were on the 4th floor we had a great view (4109) there were pleny of sunbeds and no problems finding a good postion to sit towels are supplied. The weather was great we only had 1 cloudy day the rest was clear blue skies…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Relaxing week in the sun,"We have just returned from a great week at this lovely hotel. We visited last year at the same time and the weather was atrocious , this time it was just the opposite . Every day bar one it was in the mid twenties great sunbathing weather. All the staff were brilliant smiling and helpful, including the reception staff,bars and all the restaurant staff. The food was excellent in all the restaurants, we went to both the Moroccan and Krystal fusion and had no complaints at all. We didn't go out this time apart from one short walk as this is our third time to Agadir. As other people have said,a polite no thank you when approached by the sellers is fine. Would we go back? Yes hopefully next year.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2015,5,Wheelchair accessible - amazing,"After a short notice change to our destination we picked Hotel Riu Palace- anxiety about wheelchair accessibility was high to say the least as we usually take weeks to research and decide. This was by far the best accessible hotel we have visited all over the world! The only tricky place for a independent wheelchair user was the slope to the snack restaurant and toilet by the pool bar - which can be achieved with wither help of a fellow traveller and I'm sure the staff would have assisted had I not been available or able to help my partner. The Spa is also wheelchair accessible and the height adjustable treatment table meant we enjoyed a Duo hammam, scrub and massage- I've never seen someone so relaxed that they could hardly push their own wheelchair! Staff were helpful and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Superb,"Just returned from a weeks break at Riu Palace. Easy check in and welcome drink. Rooms are large and clean. All the hotel was spotless.Staff friendly and very attentive. Despite a food allergy the restaurant had a large selection, was spoilt for choice and quality superb. Trips out are a must, bartering was a fun experience and although travelling alone met many nationalities both on trips and in the hotel. I would go back.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is magnificent, I didn't want to come back home. Can't forget the food either. I'm such a picky eater but I was not disappointed with what they had. They had a wide variety of food to choose from and food was delicious. To end it all it was a brilliant holiday and everyone should visit Rui tikida palace! Xx",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Amazing,"We returned from this hotel a few weeks ago and cannot rate it high enough. Yes there were a few problems but they were sorted very quickly and efficiently. We normally like to try different places and hotels but my husband is insisting we return in April for our 10th Anniversary. The food was the best we have ever tasted and as my husband is an ex chef he is normally quite critical. The drinks are varied and also quite good. We tipped only small amounts and took some bags of chocolates over to tip before we managed to get money changed but in contrast to other reviews, we did not see anyone treated better for tipping as everyone was treated very well. Every member of staff was helpful and friendly. Within the hotel, definitely try the Krystal restaurant as it s excellent and a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Fab Hotel - Winter Sun,"We read some great reviews before we went and also looked at the not so good ones, but after staying at the hotel last week I can honestly say that I agree with the great reviews definitely 5 star, staff were great, management were equally good, made them selfs known, you always saw the Managers walking round talking to guests snd staff, cannot fault the hotel at all. Great facilities, great rooms very spacious, the hotel is situated nicely on the beach with a amazing promenade for walks. Don't believe what you hear about being hassled when out we yes people will ask you to buy but once you say no they leave you alone, especially the roped off area of the beach for the hotel as the sellers are not allowed inside the ropes. We did z day trip to Marrakesh which was amazing and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,4,Mostly great but a couple of flaws.,"We've just returned from a very enjoyable week here. We were greeted with a cocktail and check in was very efficient. We opened the door to our standard pool view room and were amazed at how big and how nice it was. If we had paid to upgrade to a junior suite I would have happily accepted this room. As a standard room it was exceptional. We then went for a stroll round the pool area and again this is a great area with plenty of space and lots of good quality sun beds. Between the pool and hotel there are some large comfortable sofa areas which from a distance look lovely but on closer inspection are filthy and clearly have been for a considerable time. It is odd to have permanent fabric sofas permanently outside and worse still, never properly cleaned. I only saw one…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Six of the best!,"Arrived home yesterday after a great week at this amazing hotel. Although this hotel has only been open for a few years, this was our 6th visit! Absolutely love the place! It's a great 5 star hotel in a great location, but the real stars of this hotel are the staff! They are so friendly and you couldn't wish for better service. Food and drinks are amazing - as you will see from almost all the reviews on this site. We tend to go here off season, so either October / November or January / February when the weather is always a lot better than the UK, and prices are excellent also. If you are considering going to this hotel, my only advice is: Just do it!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Should be more than 5 star,"I was surprised to see some negative views on here. This hotel was fantastic, spent a week in lovely November weather, paid extra for a garden/ pool room which was a suite. Lovely staff, very friendly. Food was fantastic so much choice. Very clean and well kept. Good spa. Evening entertainment not great but wasn't important. Good drinks, very nice wine. Service nothing too much trouble. The pool staff did sometimes forget to bring ordered drinks but you could just walk to one of the two outside bars. A la carte restaurants lacked atmosphere, would have been better to offer true Morocco experience. We didn't want to leave, I would go back. Security at airport and hotel good. Riu Palace should be proud of its staff",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2014,5,Little gem.,"Travelled with my partner in June 2014. Was a real hidden treasure. Great location, fantastic cocktails. Rooms were modern and the restaurants were also of a good quality. Staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was not over packed so the staff remembered you and your drinks. Would I stay again? Yes, defiantly. Would I reccomend to friends/family. I already have.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,What a great hotel!,"After reading such glowing reviews about the hotel - I am pleased to report that they are all true. From the quality and size of the rooms which as a standard room looked more like a suite, to the quality of food and drink available as standard. The staff are so friendly and the grounds of the hotel are immaculate. Many guests that we chatted to had come back to the hotel for a repeat visit. Always a good sign! The swimming pools are lovely. The sunbeams are comfortable and the beach is a stones throw away across the path. The sundown bar at the end of the complex allows for some amazing sunset views. When me and my friends were trying to think of things the hotel could improve on we could only come up with 2: bigger beach towels by the pool and better hand driers in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Fantastic hotel,Just back from a week at this hotel and it was perfect. The staff cannot do enough for you. The hotel was spotless at all times. We were on level 2 which was perfect. The pool was great we really cannot fault anything. A week was just not long enough but we will be back!! The food had such a variety that they was always something we liked. Just perfect..,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,"Beautiful, great place to relax!","Very happy with this choice. I think it would be very tuff to find a nicer hotel with better location on the beach in Agadir (across from walkway). Room, food, drinks, staff all good. The size of room and patio was surprising. Only thing I would change would be to hear the outdoor pools a little. Was like taking a polar bear swim!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,Third Time.,"This is our third time at this hotel,and we absolutely love it. A perfect ,lovely hotel,we can,t fault it. There is always something to do,if you want ,otherwise plenty of places to just relax and do nothing if that,s what you want. All the staff are very pleasant and nothing is too much trouble, a special thank you to one of the chefs Hafis he cooked some beautiful fish for me, but there was a good selection of meat for my husband. No doubt we will be back next year.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,Great attention to detail,"Our second visit (October 2015). This is a wonderful top-class hotel with great choice of food and drink, excellent facilities (in and out pools, gym etc) and very helpful and happy staff - always a good sign. The deputy manager, Monsieur Alberto Abreu, is always in attendance, speaking to guests, checking all is well. He is a reassuring presence in a very well-run establishment. The food! The food! Wifi is in the main concourse (plenty of leisurely seating) rather than in rooms, but this is not important on a holiday.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,4,Lived up to expectations.,"After reading many of the very favourable views on trip adviser, hoping for the same experience, we were not dissapionted. When you enter the Tikida Palace you encounter a huge reception area, that also doubles as some where to sit at night and relax, listening to a solo singer. This area is typical Morrocan dark woods and deep sumptuous furnishings that are extremely comfortable. Like all public areas of the hotel it's very clean and well maintained. The grounds are extremely well manicured, and again there is no litter in sight. The outdoor pools are clean, sun beds are plenty and have nice cushions, and the pool attendants will move a parasol or sun bed for you, nothing is too much trouble. I have to comment that the staff at this hotel are fantastic, I did not find that they…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,First time visitors,"Well, where to start. This really is a great hotel. It was our first time in Morocco and we have to say the people are fantastic, really friendly, go out of their way to help and don't have a bias towards a particular language as we have found in other parts of the world. The hotel is spotless, if you stand still too long you will end up highly polished. The food was varied and great quality, yes it was a bit on the warm to cold side at times, but catering for 1000 people isn't that easy! Try both the Krystal and morocain restaurants, which need to be booked at reception, the food and service is first class. We did not use the spa facilities but did spend time by the two pools and long clean beach. Even with the multitude of sunbeds available there were still towel idiots who…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Lovely Hotel,"A lovely hotel less than 4 years old, large moden bedrooms, nice gardens and pools (2). The quality of food served in the resraurants (4) is very good, so much choice you will not know where to start! As for the wine served at your table, you dont just get a glass but they leave you the freshly opened bottle, thats a 1st for us at any hotel we have stayed at! all the staff were very friendly and helpful.Just one point to note, there are currently no disabled (easy) access to the pools, but I understand from management that this should be rectified soon. The hotel is right on the sea front with a great sandy beach and a long promenade for daily walks or walk along the long beach.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,Why go Anywhere Else?,"I reviewed this hotel last year after a most enjoyable holiday. We returned this year and found that like a good wine the hotel had improved and we had one of our best ever holidays. The weather did help as after sitting on a plane for three hours in a fog bound Gatwick we arrived in Agadir and never saw a cloud until we returned to UK. Check in was quick and efficient and a query we had over our allocated room was quickly resolved despite our delayed arrival and the hotel having a fairly high occupancy All the main dining areas are buffet style but the variety and quality of food on offer makes it hard to decide what not to choose as we were faced with at least three choices at every meal. This visit we felt that the quality of the meats had improved and the steak, lamb and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,5,First Class,"Being unable to go to Tunisia or Egypt we decided to try Agadir for the first time, what a good decision it turned out to be. The Tikida Palace is absolutely amazing full credit must go to the general manager Mr. Alberto and his amazing staff. The whole place is spotlessly clean, the rooms are huge and very well appointed and maintained. Staff are extremely friendly and courteous, nothing is too much trouble. Food is of a very good standard in the buffet restaurants especially at lunch times but you must try the a-la-carte restaurants especially the Krystal where you can dine on turbot, fillet steak and duck breast to name but three, a big thank you must go to Sadia and Said in the Krystal restaurant as they work very hard to ensure your dining experience is unforgettable. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2015,3,"Lovely hotel, but service costs extra","My rating of this hotel is 3*, which could quite easily have been a 5* if a few things were different. Summary - 1) If you want to learn surfing, it's good with loads of surf schools on the beach. 2) Don't leave your possessions unattended (the safe is free and best) 3) Don't let the male waiters try to chat your partner up (was funny to watch though) 4) I'm good at my job, I don't expect to get tipped for doing it. A 5* service should be included in the 5* price Read on to see why.. As other comments about the hotel say, it is a fantastic looking hotel with grand features and idyllic location with a few choices of restaurants to eat at. Can not fault the room we stayed in, was spot on with a free mini-bar too. Other than the appearance of the hotel, nothing else was 5*…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Very stylish hotel, mix of French, English and German guests with good food and excellent service. Plenty of sunbeds around the pool and a private area on the beautiful beach. Tip - Orange taxis are a set price to get around the town but they try nicely to get you to pay more. There's not much to see in the local area unless you go on trips or to the souk but perfect to relax and spend very little outside the hotel. Our weather was perfect every day. So lucky!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is immaculate the cleaning staff do a fantastic job in all areas. Branded spirits and mixers but if you don’t specify what you want you will be served the local brands.

We went with an open mind not having visited Morocco before and we were so pleased we chose the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. We arrived at Agadir very late due to night flights from Manchester - be prepared for a long wait to get through Passport Control at the Airport they really do not rush themselves. After a fairly short transfer we arrived at the hotel and went through a very quick and efficient booking in service. We were told there were some sandwiches prepared for us, but to be truthful we didn't find them (they were in the dining room - obviously we must of been too tired and perhaps didn't listen properly). …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The rooms are spacious and comfortable with a proper rain shower and we were lucky enough to get one on the third floor (best floor in my opinion as close to the dining room and bar areas), with a great view facing onto the pool/garden. My only gripe here would be the privacy as the bathroom and toilet had only wooden french doors which can be closed but not locked! Wifi was also a bit of an issue since there was none in the rooms and there were times during the day around the pool and at night indoors when I couldn't get on the internet at all - not great if you have some urgent work to attend to but then again that wouldn't affect most people.

We Ate at both restaurants of site which are all included in the price and unlimited visits unlike some other resorts, just need to make sure you book at reception prior. The buffet however was superb lots and lots of choice and all cooked fresh. All alcoholic drinks were top shelf and branded, Jack Daniels, Grants, black and white etc. My only criticism was the hotel is a little rough around the edges and I guess it is need of a lick of paint in some place.

You can get wi-fi in the lobby but as everyone is trying to connect I found you get a much better connection in the main restaurant, if you are discreet, as it does state no phones! :-) We had adjoning rooms on 4th floor, with a view of the side street but we had sun shining in our room every morning (a lovely wake-up call) and we were only in the room to get changed at…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Staff couldn't do enough for you and nothing was to much trouble. Thomson Reps Dan and Hassan were fab too, and very approachable which is always helpful. My friend was gluten free and the chef made her a gluten free birthday cake which was great! Animation team were so much fun, and the Aqua Gym (water aerobics) were a must do every day at 12! Beds could do with being a bit softer though, but even then, they put some toppers on for me to make it more comfortable. As for the food, I defy anyone to go there and say there wasn't anything for them to eat, food was beautiful, amazing chefs.

 July 2015,5,11/10 Trip!,"I went on this trip with my girlfriend. It's perfect for a nice relaxing holiday. We booked a pool view room and ended up getting a pool and sea view with a beautiful view of the mountain. It was spectacular. We arrived and was greeted with cocktails and out suitcases were taken to our room by our porter. Our room was cleaned everyday without fail. In fact, the hotel was cleaned every morning by an army of dedicated, pleasant and welcoming clean team. While we were there you could book 2 restaurants (Krystal fusion and Morrocan). There is a third (Italian) however this was not open. Usually in the mornings we would go to breakfast where you could get beans, eggs, sausages, bacon, pastries, fresh fruit, fresh juice, yoghurts, pancakes freshly made in front of you and cereals.

 September 2015,5,Superb hotel and fantastic staff,"We stayed for the second time in this hotel and were even more impressed than the first time. Room was amazing, pool area large relaxed and spacious, general restaurant food was varied and excellent quality, a la carte restaurants were 5 * standard. Azeddine runs the Crystal superbly and Soufiane manager in the main restaurant was extremely attentive. We had cause to depart early due to a close family bereavement but the staff and reps did all in there power to,get us home immediately and help to get us through a difficult time. The management of this hotel are fully committed to customer satisfaction and are always in the hotel talking to the guests and eating in the restaurants. That says it all.

 October 2015,5,Excellent - best holiday we've had,"Me and my 17 year old daughter booked this hotel last minute, 2 weeks before, based on the reviews of tripadvisor. it really does have the wow factor, the hotel lobby/reception is very spacious with lots of comfy seats. You never felt you were on top of each other. You can only get wifi in the lobby and bar area, but who wants to be on social media all day, its a holiday!! We had seen the photo's on thomson's website, and we have to say it exceeded our expectations. We were on the 2nd floor (room 2126), lovely view of the pool. The room was superb, very spacious, spotlessly clean always, modern and contemporary. The bathroom all marble and the shower is to die for. Plenty of room for all your clothes. Its the best room we have every stayed in. Free safe which is really…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Some amazing salads including traditional English and Morrocan tagines. Fab desserts my fav was the small choux buns and tiny pastries Choice of ice creams too.

 October 2015,5,Fab hotel!,"Sat typing this in the reception, Kir Royale in hand, whilst waiting to go home :-( Came away last minute with my two boys for a much needed break. We've had a lovely time. The hotel is immaculate, rooms are large and comfortable. The staff are great, every single person I've talked to this week has been lovely. I've done some of the fitness classes - and the aqua gym at midday is practically compulsory! My boys have loved the daily beach volleyball - which gets very competitive! The food and drink has been exceptional, with plenty of variety and choice. There is no obligation at all but I found the occasional 10 dirham tip was very much appreciated and certainly got you attentive service. We've been very guilty of not really making the effort to leave the hotel - I did manage…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2015,5,Wonderful hotel and holiday,"My wife and I went to the Riu Palace Tikida on the 3rd September to 14th September 2015. As we have never been to Agadir before we didn't know what to expect, but we have been to many Riu hotels before but we found this one to be excellent. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful, we had booked for a pool view and we got a lovely room (which was well worth paying the upgrade) which was very spacious and spotlessly clean. There was a small fridge in the room which was stocked everyday with small cans of beer, Coke, Fanta orange, tonic water and always large bottles of water. Also they supplied a kettle and mugs and sachets of coffee, sugar, milk etc. The bathrooms are very nice and they supply a hairdryer which I found to be very good. Also in your room is a digital…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2015,5,"A super hotel and excellent stay-Alberto, The Deputy Manager and his staff were first class.","This hotel is number one in Agadir for a reason. Facilities are excellent, it is located right on the promenade, super staff and management team. The food is varied, with a choice of restaurants and all in all if you wish to visit Agadir then this is the hotel for you. An opportunity for the Hotel would be to make the wifi a little more widely available, however, to be fair I have stayed here twice and would not hesitate to return. A super hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,"""It was my second visit .. I will be back ..But...""","This is a hotel that is of very high standard in the "" all inclusive"" category "" for Morocco. So that's my first point .. Don't compare it to Egypt or other places.. This is Morocco and compared to other hotels here it's very good. Secondly like all resort hotels there are normal problems with people claiming sun loungers from early morning with their towels etc.. Don't blame the hotel for the ignorance of others .. Thirdly I was astonished to read comments about theft etc. My experience was on returning to my room to find a little note from housekeeping and a €50 bill that I had by accident let fall on the floor of the bathroom.. This was an example of honesty that was "" above and beyond"".. Final overall point. This is a Muslim country. As a guest I must respect its…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed at the Riu Palace the first week of October and were thoroughly impressed. The hotel itself was one of the biggest I've stayed in but it was immaculate in every sense of the word. Hotel rooms were beautiful and clean, grounds were well maintained and equally as beautiful to look at, and the communal areas were very welcoming. The pool itself was amazing! It looked beautiful and the loungers were extremely comfortable. Food & drink was fab... breakfast & lunch felt a little repetitive compared to dinner, but there was a large choice so if you're not a fussy eater there would be the opportunity not to eat the same thing twice in a week. We ate at the Moroccan a la carte one evening & felt let down. The food was in no way of a different standard to the main buffet and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,Another brilliant return visit,"My husband and I stayed here for a week from 12th October, this is our second visit, yet again, the staff, the cleanliness, the food, still amazing. The rooms are lovely, huge, clean and big enough for a family! Hotel reception, the friendliest I have come across. As for the food, I think you would have to be hard pushed to not like anything, it's gorgeous, the chefs are lovely. We will be going back in February, can't wait.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2015,4,4 out of 5,Celebrated the wifes 40th with a 7 day stay at this hotel. Hotel is nice and the grounds are well maintained. Our room consisted of a nice pool view. Spacious room with comfortable beds and well maintained by the cleaners. The breakfast buffet was ok but we felt like the quality could improve and a change up of the items would be good. The hotel is around a 10 minute walk to the beach and 10 minutes away from the marina. Only downside to this hotel was the wifi kept losing signal! Overall a good hotel at a very reasonable price,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,5,Very pleasure holidays,"Amazing holiday. we went there in April 2012 just a month after they opened the holiday. Food was delicious, staff very helpful. Area around the pool very posh and comfortable especially the big pillows. We looking forward to visit them again very soon😊",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,Excellent holiday,"Booked this holiday as a last minute getaway to Morocco. We flew from Manchester and the biggest negative of the Holiday is the flight times ! In true style , Passport control at Agadir was horrendous, much the same as Tunisia....be prepared for a wait ! Upon arrival to the hotel it didn't seem much, but when we went into the lobby it was very impressive in true Riu style. We were greeted with a welcome drink and checked in, we were told there was a cold buffet laid on but when we got there, it only contained desserts. We went to our room , where we had booked a pool view and was disappointed to see we had a tree view. The following morning we went to the reception and they agreed to change our room and we are glad we did ... wow ! **Top Tip - Ask for room 4128 / 4130 / 4132 /…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2015,4,We took a chance,"We are travelers who never opt for an all-inclusive resort so this was an unusual circumstance for us and I guess this review would be more directed to those who might find themselves as we did-afraid to pull the trigger and book here. We chose this hotel b/c it was #1 on TA and the reviews were positive. The other properties had significant negatives noted for our comfort and the Riu seemed to be a good value considering all that was included. And of course it looks very nice! So after much back and forth we booked. If this is who you are, you must set your expectations accordingly in terms of the all-inclusive culture. But that being said in many ways the Riu exceeded our expectations. The property is very beautiful and very well maintained. Our room and the common spaces were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,"Best combination of location, comfort and price","Two-person rooms are big enough for our whole family of four. That made it the best price for our stay for a week. The comfort and servics of the hotel and its staff were 4,5 - 5,0 stars. Although it was a buffet experience for a week, the restaurant was never boring, all food was delicious so we didn't get bored. The location across the beach is 6-stars!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,1,WARNING - THEFT FROM SAFE AT RIU HOTEL Tikida Agadir,"We stayed at the Tikida Palace Agadir from 15 October and went to check out on the 22 October. (4pm) On emptying our safe we found £80 sterling was missing. We placed the money in the safe at the beginning of our holiday, we saw the cash was in the safe on Tuesday 20th as we had to have the safe settings reset. We called reception and advised the above. They sent someone to check the door entry over the last week. On going to reception they said it was ‘impossible for the safe to be broken into’. We explained we were fairly certain the safe was closed whenever leaving the room but if it was inadvertently left open it would still show that someone had taken the money. This was not readily accepted. We asked to speak to the manager were advised the duty manager…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,Again amazing holiday!!!,"Just returned back from agadir, this time visited with family and friends and again it blew me away! The staff at this hotel are amazing, yes I tip the waiting staff but the entertainment team who do not get tips are also friendly and help to make your holiday relaxing and fun, nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff, the manager even came on our coach to say thankyou to us when we were leaving, never known this in all the 30+ years I've been travelling. The food is brilliant with so much choice you can't help but eat too much. The rooms are spotless and spacious. Thank you too all the staff for making our holiday amazing.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,3rd Visit to this wonderful hotel,"Just returned from another brilliant holiday (despite the rain - first time ever in 3 years). The whole experience was brilliant, as usual. The staff everywhere are so attentive, especially in the restaurants, Abdahamillas (?) he said to call him Abda! The service we received was superb. There are so many willing, smiling waiters and waitresses at this hotel, also chambermaids, it is very hard to chose a favourite. We stayed in room 4043, can't complain about anything, but it would be good to overlook the pool next time we visit!!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,4,relaxing break,"Lovely holiday with great staff. The hotel had all you needed - plenty of sunbeds, plenty of food and plenty of drink. The staff were more than willing to help and clear up any problems. The Thomson rep was great - didn't see a great deal from him after the initial chat but he was on site almost every day. Careful if you book a room with a view - not always the pool and sea view - we saw garden and a concrete plaza Did a couple of trips through Thomson - quite pricey some of them but no real complaints. Like others complaining - would have been great if wifi was in the room not just reception All over a lovely break - would definitely stay at this hotel again",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2015,5,Only one word ...gorgeous !!!!!,"After spending one week at the Riu Palace Tikida in Agadir we were so satisfied, rested and full of energy . The hotel grounds are beautiful. The are good furnished , very clean and comfortable . Large bedroom, spacious balcony with pool and see view. The restaurants are excellent with plenty of choice every time of day . The hotel staff are really warming, professional and welcoming . The see is a little bit rough, but amaizing !!! I would definitely recommanded this hotel and I will most certainly retutrn there .",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2015,3,Lovely hotel but wouldn't return,"The hotel itself is lovely, fantastic staff, very attentive. The hotel is very clean ,but our shower was mouldy and the sink was broken so some improvements needed. The welcome meeting was really about trips, not what you needed to know. The weather was not great, the sun not coming out until the afternoon. The sunbed situation is ridiculous, people are that desperate that one day my Husband couldn't sleep, so was up early and managed to get a cabana, the couple that usually had that cabana gave us daggers all day and made sure they had it for the rest of the holiday, so knock yourself out we thought! Very sad! Food is lovely and plentiful, but sadly a virus hit the hotel the second week, and all we ate were bananas and some soup, we were really poorly.

 October 2015,5,Absolutely fabulous,"I have just returned from my 7th visit to this hotel and that in itself speaks volumes for the place. Everything you could possibly want is available in and around the hotel, from the moment you enter the vast air conditioned lobby / reception area the quality surrounds you and when you have taken a deep breath to take it all in make your way to the efficient and speedy reception desk the staff are extremely polite and greet you with a welcoming cocktail and a bright smile. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with a min bar stocked up regularly.

 September 2015,3,Dissapointing stay,"This hotel has the potential to be extremely good but it needs improvement. It is contemporary and stylish, impressive when you first arrive. Taxis cannot pull up in front of the hotel doors so you are left to carry luggage up the entrance stairs – no help offered. The pool area is crowed with sun loungers very close together. We choose to use the beach to get away from the crowds and the music. Rooms are large but very dark wardrobe areas which make it difficult to see into the safe and wardrobes. Noise is a big issue and we slept with earplugs after changing rooms. You can hear everything through the walls/ceiling including the air con and loo visits!! Sleep comfort – very hard uncomfortable beds. Even with a folded up duvet on top of the mattress which was pretty…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2015,4,Second visit to Agadir - would be happy going back to this hotel,"Food, staff and service were great. Included drinks were good considering price paid. Room was well furnished and comfortable. Unfortunately I had to do a bit of work so bought my laptop. When I asked for a cable to connect my laptop in the room this was not a problem and free. Compared to other more expensive hotels which charge excessive amounts for internet access this was a welcome relief. If you want to keep fit, get fit or need motivation for it the Riu and Moroccan attitude is fantastic. Finally if you were picky you could always find minor faults but taking into account the price paid this was one of the best. It has a different character to the other Riu hotel in Agadir being larger but having stayed at both it would be difficult to say which is best.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,Retuning Visit to The Palace,"We have just returned from another exceptional visit to the Riu Tikida Palace in Agadir. The management and staff gave us a genuine warm welcome throughout the entire week. The reception staff were most helpful with advice. The food was amazing with something to cater for all tastes.The waiting staff made our holiday so special as they were so friendly and obliging especially Samira, Tarek and Said. Our hotel room was contemporary, clean and spacious and our maid Rabia was so hard working and eager to please us. The gardens are amazing,without a single weed and pool areas are spotless. Thank you all for making our holiday a happy memory.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We have stayed in many all inclusive hotels all over the world and a few Rius before and this is the best ever! Don't believe any of the negative reviews this really is a truly special hotel. The hotel and rooms are great, spacious really clean and comfortable. The hotel facilities are really good and the decor is great but the best bits are the food and the staff. The food is wonderful I dare anyone to find something to complain about on that front and the staff are brill, polite, friendly courteous but not pushy. Its so good we are already booking for February, its a truly great place to relax. Well done Riu.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2015,5,Unbelievable and a Must,"The hotel is the very best in everything from start to finish. When we arrived our room was not ready was we were given an upgrade, when I broke my glasses they were fixed nothing was too much trouble.

 October 2015,5,Second visit to this fantastic 5 star hotel!,"We have just returned from our second fantastic stay at the Tikida Palace. The hotel grounds are beautiful with very modern and contemporary decor. We opted for a suite and were not disappointed with a large bedroom, living room and spacious balcony with sea view. The restaurants are excellent with plenty of choice to suite everyone's tastes. The a la carte restaurant are wonderful and definitely worth a visit. The hotel staff were really attentive and I would like to say a special thanks to Soufiane and Azeddine whose service was fantastic and they really made our holiday extra special.

We couldn't thank the staff enough in the restaurant who work so hard and always have smiles upon there faces ( Mohamed, Nora and Soufiane especially). The animation team do a great job of entertaining the guests and all seem very enthusiastic about there job! Youssef was my favourite! There was always a variety of high quality food within the restaurant and something for everyone. Also the cleanliness of the hotel is superb, couldn't fault it.

 October 2015,5,"5 star, truly amazing","We stayed here for the second part of our ten night twin centre trip (Marrakech and agadir). Just waiting to get picked up to go to the airport and I'm so sad to be leaving! This hotel was far far superior to that of the palmerie in Marrakech. Pool was amazing we never had an issue getting sun loungers or an umbrella. Food was the best all inclusive I have ever had, plenty to chose from and in the evening chefs cooking in front of you! At dinner if they offer you white, red or rose wine you get the whole bottle not just a glass!! We tried the crystal restaurant which was fab - the steak was to die for!

We had a pool view which was worth the extra cost and our overall view was great looking out to see and the kasbah. The pool area was lovely, very clean and we had no problems getting a bed in peak season. The bars outside were great and staff at both very attentive. We ate in all the restaurants and enjoyed them all with Krystal being our favourite we visited here twice.

However we're on holiday ""chill out"" said my 18 year old, and for once he was right....!! :) there is so much to love about this place, the food, the rooms, the common areas, the excellent pool and direct beech access, the bars and selection of all your favourite brands (except captain Morgan ) with Riu you can generally expect an extremely well run, immaculate and friendly experience ...can't recommend this place or…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2015,5,RIU does it again...Superb.,"We stayed at the Riu Tikida Palace. Agadir from 1st October 2015 for 11 nights. Wow...what an experience, This is probably the best Riu hotel we've stayed in, absolute luxury and worthy of its 5 star rating. It's hard to find anything worth criticising but I suppose some guests will always find something however small, some may say it's a little too big with over 460 rooms so is a little impersonal. The building is only about 3 years old so all the decor and furnishings are up to date with an African theme. The hotel is located in a pleasant area on the sea front with shops, bars and restaurants within minutes of leaving the front entrance.

I was lucky enough to visit many luxury hotels in Europe and Asia and still I was impressed with the Tikida palace services. As mentioned in a lot of reviews below, all the staff is very friendly and always ready to help you with anything you need. This makes your stay really pleasant, big thumbs up for the management :) HOTEL ROOMS – they are more practically furnished, nothing really extraordinary.

The food was faultless with lots of different cuisines available and the al la carte restraunts were also fabulous.

Every member of staff, from the maids, to the bar staff, to the pool attendants, could not have helped you enough. The room was spacious, comfortable and well designed. Pool area generous with swim up bar and activities to join in with if you choose. Restaurants are buffet style with lots of variety for the fussiest of eaters.

All of the staff are really friendly, check-in was quick and easy. The animation team are wicked, they are so happy all the time and enthusiastic and clearly love their jobs. The staff at the lobby bar are also lovely, however the pool bar can be a bit slow with service but it's not really a big deal!

First impression when we arrived the reception area was stunning and spotless. Check in went smooth with no issues. The receptionist said that we had a very nice room and we thought yes heard that one before, but wow when we went on to the balcony the view was stunning although it was at night we had a pool and sea view but the wow factor came from the mountain with the writing on. The food was outstanding never went hungry. The Head Chief was always around making sure all was ok.

The hotel grounds are beautiful and very well kept. The food was lovely, something different everyday if you like varied foods. Recommend trying the Krystal and Moroccan restaurant, excellent service and delicious food. Couple of downfalls but these are personal, the bar service at the pool is hit and miss, sometimes understaffed. They also don't really serve you at your sunbed.

It's always nice to return to a hotel when the staff great you like old friends. The rooms at the Riu Palace are among the best we have stayed in, clean, roomy and overlooking the pool with partial sea views, although we were a little disappointed that we didn't get the double bed requested and there was no wifi available in the room. The food, as always, was extremely good and varied and I think even the fussiest of eaters would struggle to come away from the restaurant dissatisfied.

 September 2015,4,First timer,My now ex partner booked this hotel. On arriving yes the hotel is lovely to look at as most Riu Hotel's are. We had a room that had a pool view. The first problem encountered was for a 5* star hotel there was no wi-fi in the room. In this day and age where everyone has tablets and phones you may not necessarily want to leave your room to go upstairs to get wi-fi reception. I couldn't play music in the room and even though if I went outside you get wifi it was hit and miss. Even when upstairs and by the pool the connection was extremely poor. Food was OK most days but then got very boring. I did enjoy my holiday but wished I went with someone who didn't snore and who was less annoying! I would stay again but I would go with someone else. Lovely housekeeping girls and the…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

There was a large variety of food including seafood, chicken, turkey, rabbit and veggies and not to mention the desserts were delicious! The staff were so nice and helpful and doing such a good job. I wanted to specifically thank Youssef from entertainment who made our stay fun playing darts, volleyball and table tennis. I also urgently needed paracetamol and he actually took his time after work to walk with us to the pharmacy which was SO helpful because we dont know any arabic.

Equipped with TV, hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities, a fridge that is re-stocked daily with soft drinks, water and a couple of beers. The downside to the rooms is the noise you can hear from the corridors and people when they are returning to their rooms late at night with no regard for sleeping guests. The issue of reserving sun beds really does need addressing by management as we witnessed people reserving beds from 6.30am, but more annoyingly not then returning…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2015,3,Service from staff very hit and miss,"Arrived at the hotel just after 12am which was 1 hour and forty minutes late, the hotel laid on some cold meats and salad for us just in case anybody was hungry which was very thoughtful. We were told that our suit cases would be delivered to our room but over an hour later we had still not received them which meant we could not freshen up. When we spoke to reception they did not have a clue, so my partner went looking for them and found both cases along the hall outside the lifts. This meant we did not get to bed until 3am that day. Started our holiday looking for a sun bed that was nearly impossible as most of them had towels on them since 6am that morning even though the notices clearly said not to. Found one eventually with the help of the staff at the pool. Service at the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

All areas are kept spotlessly clean Lovely food in the buffet restaurant with plenty of choice Nice pool area with good quality, comfortable sun loungers. The Bad Sleep comfort - The beds are amongst the hardest I've ever experienced in a hotel to the extent where I dreaded going to bed.

 September 2015,4,Slightly disappointed,"We had been recommended this hotel by people we had met in another Riu Hotel and was a bit disappointed once we had arrived. Don't get me wrong the Hotel itself is absolutely beautiful but the service we received from staff was a little poor. Check-in went smoothly but we were left to find our own rooms with just vague directions from reception staff. After wandering around for a while we found our room only to have to wait for three quarters of an hour for our luggage to turn up which was most annoying seeing as we arrived around half past midnight, very tired and just wanting to unpack and go to bed. The food in the main restaurant was good but only lukewarm and sometimes cold. We found some of the staff a bit unfriendly and the service at times very poor having to ask…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Plenty of wardrobe space and plenty of hangers. Lots of comments on Trip advisor say food repetative but they could not have looked properly Every evening there was 3 fish choices 3 meat meal choices always a carvery and always Moroccan dishes if you wanted them. Pizzas, pasta meals also. At lunchtime always plenty of choice and the salads were to die for. Agadir exceptionally clean, always sweeping and mopping everywhere, no litter.

We were shown to our room, which was on the second floor (reception is on the third floor) - view not great, we looked out on to a service road down the side of the hotel, so if you can pay a bit extra for either a room with a view of the pool or the sea, probably worth it. The room itself was very nice, with a lounge area, comfortable bed, air con and fan, separate wardrobe area, with twin sinks, bath with shower over and toilet/bidet in a separate area with doors.

If you expect the same 5* standards in a country like Morocco or Egypt, to those of the Caribbean, Maldives or even Sri Lanka, then you will be disappointed! Now don't get me wrong, this hotel is fantastic, my point is, & I think therein lies the issue, People read ""5*"" & expect the world! Yes you expect a certain standard & having been all over the world myself experiencing many different cultures & levels of service, there really isn't anything wrong with the Riu Takida Palace. As with any situation in life, & indeed hotels no matter if it's the Ritz Carlton or Uncle Bob's B&B in Clethorps, you'll always find faults if you go looking for them.

We had a complimentary minibar which was replenished daily (i think this is standard in all rooms) with Fanta, Sprite, Coke, Beer, sparkling water and also still water.

Our room 4126 was always spotlessly clean and the bed comfortable. Regarding the towel game it does go on but we never failed to get beds no matter what time we got to the pool .

The staff are great from the moment you check-in to the moment you check-out. Rachiiiiid and Adnan are very talented and offer top entertainment value as do the rest of the animation team. Hamada was also very good, I have never seen an aquagym so busy! Omar, Faisil, Aziz, Mohammed and Maniche were great, as were all the others who worked flat out.

It wasn't until we got to the room that we realised we had been upgraded to a suite! room 4009. It was beautiful and very spacious! The hotel its self is very big and well presented!

 September 2015,5,Fabulous Holiday,"First time we have ever been on an 'All Inclusive' holiday - purely by choice, so we were a little wary that we would find that after a few days the food may become a little monotonous etc, However, certainly this was never the case and we can only rate the choice and quality of food as 'outstanding'. In fact the hotel, staff, cleanliness, facilities can be considered in the same category and everyone we spoke to were of the same opinion. Some of the staff outshone the others but isn't that always the case, and to have so many quality, multilingual staff is something that the hotel should be really proud of.

What really impressed me though was how all the staff seemed to be busy all the time, I never saw anyone standing around doing nothing, but they always had smiles on their faces.

Once assigned rooms a porter took our bags to our room whilst we were instructed where to go to eat however there was no food which was disappointing after a long day. This was no problem a chef soon came out with soup and a light buffet. It was just enough to keep us going.

 September 2015,4,Amazing honeymoon with just a few hiccups!,"We stayed here for the first week in September for our honeymoon. Due to having small children who we left with nanny we were looking for somewhere luxurious with great weather but not too far away during September and I think we found exactly that with this hotel! Our room was BEAUTIFUL - we were convinced we had been upgraded to a suite when we first arrived due to the sheer size of the room and the bed although after 'nosing' into other rooms when the doors were open with the cleaners we noticed all rooms were the same. The best standard double room we have ever seen! We were greeted with a bottle of champagne, 2 glasses and a selection of fresh fruit on arrival which I presume was left because of it being our honeymoon but this was a lovely touch thank you! The room was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The suite was just wonderful, sea view, babycot set up, mini bar stocked, although no wine or spirits in the there which was disappointing! Up at 9.am, managed 3 sunbed nxt to pool for the children..

 September 2015,5,Perfect hotel for a relaxing break ... we loved it.,"Just back from a one week all inclusive holiday at the Tikida Palace and this hotel definitely has it all. We have stayed in various 4 & 5 star hotels in Lanzarote, Tenerife, Spain and the Algarve but Tikida Palace was undoubtedly the best. We were a little hesitant initially going All Inclusive as we had done this before in Lanzarote and by the end of the week we were a little tired with the 'sameness' of it all. Not with the Tikida Palace. The hotel is so vast that we never felt claustrophobic ... lots of place to sit and relax either inside or outside (in sun and shade). The food was great, plenty of variety catering for everyone. And all served by staff with a smile. The dining room staff were great and even remembered my request for a seat by the window for breakfast…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The room sizes are very generous and the hotel is immaculately clean throughout. The standard of presentation is exceptional everywhere. Maybe this is the attention to detail on behalf of the general manager who was clearly visible, in all the restaurants at various meal times, having coffee at the pool bar & walking around reception. He was friendly and approachable making sure he spoke to as many guests as possible. The choice of food was plentiful and varied, although the quality was consistently high.

Our room was not clean even though we requested it be cleaned, and even on the second floor we had cockroaches! the light switch was falling off the wall along with the bath tap, all reported and not fixed during our stay.

We were met by Thomson Representatives at Agadir Airport and took the coach transfer to the hotel. On the coach the Thomson Rep provided us with the check-in forms to speed up the check in process which was great and made check-in much faster and easier when we arrived at the hotel. As we arrived at 11pm, some food was put aside for the arriving guests in the main restaurant. I was expecting more than cold meats and desserts for the food, but appreciated that some food was available. The hotel is very nice, had air-con in all the right places and lovely grounds.

Also would like to see a beach bar,it's along way to walk with drinks for a family.

Visited with family who went out a few days before me, when I arrived found the reception staff helpful and friendly and the restaurant open for the late check ins to have a bite to eat. When arrived at the room again it was well set out and spacious, clean with all the usual facilities. Found the pool area clean and tidy, my only disappointment would be to say not enough staff on the pool side bar, it was quick to get out the pool and be served, which I would say let them down for the two weeks I was there otherwise again staff friendly and drinks were nice.

I'm going to give a 100% honest review. Positives: The hotel itself is very beautiful and classy. The staff are always well dressed and polite. The buffet restaurant is good - the food is good, different variety! Waiters work very hard, they would do mostly anything for you. One waiter would wait until my mum finished getting her food at the buffet and bring her plate to the table for her. They would bring us so many drinks, most times I would have 5 different drinks in front of me that I wouldn't know what to drink first.

Apart from that, the hotel was excellent, shiny and clean, the staff couldn't do enough and were very friendly. Food was very varied and exquisitly presented being cooked fresh in front of you. 2 more moans, the hotel had a bad case of sunbed towelling, most were taken up by 8-8.30am and the practice of the poolside beds being under towels when no-one used them all day was annoying and the ambience was soured by squawking, miserable snot nosed over indulged brats.

 August 2015,4,Great Hotel Worth a Visit Do your research on Agadir weather.,This review is based purely on our personnel experience. This is a great hotel for a holiday. The room that we had pool view was spacious and spotlessly clean on our arrival. Check in was fast and the room was a two minute walk from reception. Big note for evening dinner. Men must wear long trousers. Shorts and anything not to the ankle are not acceptable and you will not be permitted into the restaurant. There are no exceptions which makes it fair for all although you always get someone who thinks the rules should not apply to them. It absolutely does. The food was good with dinner and lunch menus varied daily while keeping basics such as salads as standard. In the main restaurant for dinner there usually be a meat section a fish section a small Moroccan section always on the…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It was our first time in Morocco and in a Riu and I would definitely recommend this hotel and the chain. We had two rooms next to each other and would have like interconnecting but there is not the option at this hotel. Nevertheless I got used to it and felt that the children were safe on their own next door. The animation team provided a great pool side atmosphere and the kids played table tennis, french bowls, beach volleyball. The food was very good and always looked fresh and plenty full. Yes it does get a bit repetitive but we are not picky so it was all good for us. Went out a couple of times and walked the promenade daily - it is safe here.

Drinks well they were a bit hit and miss - never quite sure what you would get - but that's part of the fun. The sun bed situation is silly, there are loads of beds. We were there in August and came down to put towells on the beds on our way to breakfast at 9.30 - so sometimes we got a bed where we wanted and other times we had to compromise.

I was particularly impressed also by the attention given to the guests by the senior staff particularly by Alberto Abreu who was always around the resort to make sure that the little details were not spoiled and particularly his availability to listen and take action to issues raised by the guests.

 August 2015,4,Babymoon in Agadir,I am writing this review sitting by the pool on our last day. Its around 11am and there are plenty of empty sunlounger all reserved will towels but no one using them until after 1pm. This is my real only moan about this hotel. The hotel enforces certain rules like men must wear long trousers for dinner but then don't bother to enforce their no reserving of sunloungers even though it's clearly stated around the pool. This means that you are force to partake in the early morning retrial of getting up at 730am to get a sun lounger because if you leave it any later you won't get a sun lounger. Like I said this is the only moan I have about this hotel. Everything else has been pretty good. Yes the hotel says it's 5 star but compared to UK standards it's probably a very good 4 star.…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The pool was very clean, and the staff were very attentive wherever you went in the hotel. Agadir the place Is not my favourite, but we have booked to come again, as the experience we had delivered by the hotel was top drawer, and I would reccommend it for some woderful winter sun with excellent service.

The front desk staff were rude and abrupt but we thought that because it was late this was probably the cause. How wrong we were. We got to the room, air con inoperative, interior fan not working, lights hanging out the ceiling, rusty doors. The faults did not stop there. They are all around the hotel.

The restaurant was closing for lunch and the prawns/paella were all gone. The cook at the grill, I believe his name is Said, asked me where I was sitting. Without asking, few minutes later, he brought three freshly cooked prawns to my table. I was also very impressed by the wait staff and their lead Kabira.

Drinks are advertised as international brands but that is just Martini and a scotch. I drank the Cava which was nice and mild similar to prosecco. Cocktails were good.

Nothing wrong with the food at all and for families with children this is a perfect place. If I really need to make one comment it has more to do with the efficiency of the restaurant staff.

 June 2015,5,Grand Hotel!,"This hotel was amazing! I stayed for 10 days mid June and I can't fault the hotel. Everything in the hotel was amazing as every little detail was well thought about. The hotel was always clean and the atmosphere at night was great with 2 forms of entertainment every night. The food was brilliant with theme nights and enough choices for everybody. There is food available 24.7 which is great if you want to sleep in or if your having a late dinner. The restaurants in hotel are brilliant, do book early though as they fill up fast. Getting a seat round the pool you do have to get up quite early to get the good seats, however we have turned up to pool after the late breakfast at 12 and there has still been some spaces. There is plenty of seats on the beach however there is people…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,Highly recommend,"We returned from the Riu Palace on the 9th July 2015. It is a lovely hotel set in well kept and clean surroundings. The staff are polite and nothing is too much. Rooms are spacious with air conditioning, unlimited mini bar, LCD TV, sofa and table and chairs. Our rooms are pool facing which is a plus. Wifi is available in the main reception and limited access in other parts of the hotel. Pool area is very clean and is cleaned daily. There is enough room that other sun beds aren't on top of yours. You may need to get up early to get a good location and parasol though. The main restaurant can get quite busy but you will aways get a tablet and there is plenty of food. The selection of food is good and well presented. The food can get a little similar from one day to the next…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Good English TV channels, and lovely spacious balcony. The food was fantastic, and the trips were all branded. The only down side for me was the beach, it wasn't very nice and neither was the sea.

THEY ARE MOSQUITOS!!! So please remember to take some anti-histamines and repellent with you. Anyway... basically we were treated like vip's for 2 weeks. We like to tip every meal and also to our fave bar staff. 20/50 dirhams is 10 times as much to them as it is to us. So in 2 weeks we tipped about £200 and it was so worth it. We were recognised on our first night by our lovely waiter Rachid from last year - he then had champagne fruit and pastries brought to the room. Twice.

Some front desk staff are very helpful, others are not helpful. So if you don't get what you need try back later and speak to someone else. Non-Pool view rooms have horrible views so worth paying for the pool view! Ocean front suites are amazing. WiFi in lobby only.. Hotel should expand this to rooms.

The weather was terrible including a day of constant rain and a thunder storm. They say Morocco has 3 or 4 days rain a year, it rained at some point about 6 days we were there. Any issues I would have are only small ones, sometimes when at a bar they are a little slow serving, don't seem to get much of a drinks service around the pool area, end up fetching your own drinks most of the time, in the main restaurant there was not always somebody to find you an empty table and they are not happy if you look for your own table.

However, on my third day, it was noticed that there was blood on the bedding (from the previous guest) that had been covered up with a clean sheet. I was completely mortified and disgusted and reported it immediately. Whilst the staff member dealt with the issue promptly, I didn't feel any true remorse from her and would have preferred if I had been given the option of moving rooms.

The sun does not appear, if it does not rain all day, til midday, at best. However , this does not stop the intrusive animation team , trying to force clients into their silly games.

But as always the bad always sticks harder than the good shall we say and unfortunately I found it to be the majority of the female staff to be so unbelievably rude and look at you like dirt.

My boyfriend often asked for extra food when in the a la carte restaurants and they were happy to top up his plate! All staff are extremely friendly and can't do enough for you.

The hotel was full, but everything was running smoothly. The facilities of the hotel are sized for high season. What I disliked: There are too many staff at the reception.

I would say overall Tripadvisor offers a good reviewing service. Not everyone regardless of 4 5 6* status is going to be overall pleased at everything the hotel offers in all walks of life.

 July 2015,5,Amazing holiday,"Well where to start! From the moment we arrived we all fell in love with this place. It is such a fantastic place. The people are so friendly and all the staff are so helpful. We stayed here for two weeks and did not want to come home! We made so many amazing friends and memories and we will definitely be coming back. The food was really good although I would suggest having more of a variety but it was all cooked fresh and we never felt ill. The animation team were so good and all the shows were amazing. We constantly felt safe and secure at the hotel. It was always nice to see the manager Alberto. Check in was very easy and the people at the reception were ever so friendly and helpful. The bar staff were very good and quick. The rooms were clean and spacious, I would only…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,3,Just OK,"I have spent a week in this hotel which was reaaaally boring, first the beach is in the other side you need to cross a pathway to get there! and the beach was very full of people from outside. the swimming pool inside was poor, no toboggan... the kids club was a biiiig joke, my sister had to watch her daughter and be with her all the time in this club. The food was nice and tasty good chef. The service was OK although my sister had to argue with a waiter who ignored her request many times and she had to call for his manager who was responsive.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2015,5,Absolutely stunning hotel,Wow what an entrance to this hotel .first time in Morocco and we weren't disappointed .hotel stunning staff amazing food beautiful and a pool to die for .really couldn't fault anything .the hotel was in an amazing beach front location all inclusive and everything was free .staff couldn't do enough for you .very attentive at meal times .over a thousand people at the hotel when at full occupancy so dinner times can be busy .due to location can get windy in the afternoons and don't be too worried if you wake up and it's cloudy this soon clears up by around 11 am .we had amazing weather very hot so be careful of the midday sun .my only slight criticism is the evening entertainment was a bit poor and they had every drink apart from baileys so shall be taking a bottle with me next…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,Fantastic,"I stayed in this hotel in June. Greeted with sweet cocktails upon arrival. Luckily my girlfriend and I were upgraded to a studio room, it was safely big enough to house 15 people. The staff were incredibly friendly, probably the most obliging I've ever stayed with. The food is very good, massive selection (give the strawberry ice cream a taste, it's unreal). The only issue I'd have with it is the night life, it gets a little repetitive. If your under 30 go the club in the Sofitel, expensive, but it's a welcome change. All round a great hotel!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,4,Staff best assets,"Stayed here on a golf and relaxation week. Asked for a room on upper floor,but where shown to ground floor. Asked at reception, where the manager moved us to an upper floor room.as it went all week it was no problem. Almost the motto for the staff here.There was always something to eat which we enjoyed at each sitting. The morroco restaurant was particularly good. .Some of the cocktails tasted poor .but that was probably the only down side. Also the entertainment staff were great.but there shows were a little repetitive. The golf was superb. And because it was so hot there were very few people on the courses. But with plenty of water and a buggy we had a great time. Would look to come back again soon",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,4,A good 4 star hotel,"Got back today from this hotel.First impressions:The lobby is very grand and check in was quick and painless.We stayed in room 4127,very clean and spacious,but does need a little bit of tlc here and there.Although not a sea view room,we still had a decent view of it .We overlooked a little walkway that got very busy in the evenings with the locals playing games etc,but whilst some guests found this annoying,it didn't worry us at all,it was quite nice to watch them let their hair down and by the time we were in bed with the doors shut,we couldn't hear them at all. The pool area is very nice,freshwater which is lovely.You do have to be up by 7 to get the best beds,but we got the same ones every morning without any bother.Bar staff are really friendly and pretty quick most of the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,4,Pleasant and relaxing holiday,"We travelled as a couple for 11 nights on 9th July, we had a brilliant holiday however there were a few aspects that could have been improved. Firstly it has to be said that all staff at this hotel are absolutely exceptional, from the pool boys to the maids that cleaned our room, we simply could not fault any of them in any way!! The hotel itself is beautiful, the pool area is lovely and the swim up bar was great. The hotel's rooms are spacious and modern, however ours looked out over a car park and walkway to the beach so loud music and shouting was heard until at least 1am most nights, perhaps this was due to staying over Ramadan and eid. If you can afford to pay for a pool view room as these are on the inside of the hotel I would suggest to. Mini fridge is restocked daily…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,4,Good week away with friends,"This is a good around hotel. Mostly staff are very friendly and are very accommodating. The hotel and grounds are very carefully cleaned and manicured resulting in great place to spend a week with friends relaxing and unwinding. The rooms are spacious and modern with high quality fixtures and fittings and good AC. The weather during our stay (09-16/07/15) was a mix of beautiful sunshine contrasted with thick clouds and low lying mist each making up 50/50. Speaking with the locals, this is apparently typical for this time of year. Pros - Food of a consistent high quality, with a variety of choice. - Live cooking, with friendly chefs. - Pool area large and of interesting in design with the swin up bar. - Good amount of sun-loungers. Though many are reserved early. - Speciality…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,5,Week away with friends,This is a fantastic hotel. It exceeds all expectations. The staff are great helpful and accommodating . Fab spa. Different areas to drink with lovely views. Dining outside with great service . I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes 5 star... It is truly 5*. On my recommendation I have I know two family's that have booked. The beach is a stones through from the hotel. Lovely calm peaceful hotel with premium drinks & fantastic food.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,Absolutely Stunning First Holiday!,"Myself and my boyfriend visited this hotel a couple of months ago and we was not disappointed one bit and could not find one flaw with the hotel even if we wanted to! For my first holiday abroad it was stunning, the hotel, the views and mainly the staff, friendly, always willing to help, and make the hotel a bit more fun to stay in, never seen one of them without a smile on their face! Forever spoilt for in the food in what to chose from and always top quality! The cocktails were even more spoiling for choice! Also recommend the hot drinks too, never tried anything like them! All in all, beautiful first holiday abroad and would recommend it to anyone!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,4,Good hotel,"Came back from the lovely hotel the other week and I can only add to what has been said already about the place. We went with our 8 months old daughter so being the first time away with her was daunting but there was nothing to worry about. The hotel staff were friendly and really helpful, special mention to Kabira, Samira and Yassine (apologies if I have spelt any name incorrectly), they were extremely warm and friendly to us. I will definitely recommend this hotel if you are after a relaxing holiday. The only minor issue was the lack of wifi in the rooms but as we had a room with pool and sea view so I was able to pick up wifi in the balcony.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2015,4,we had a great holiday there in feb 2015 all the staff very helpfull,"we had a sea view room this was fantastic and a great view from our balcony all the restaurants and there are 4, with Italian, seafood also Moroccan dishes served. and only 1km from the centre of Agadir if anyone visits I can recommend the trip to the Atlas mountains. Also when we were there it was my birthday and they made my day",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,Excellent hotel,"We have just spent a week at this beautiful hotel with our 2 daughters, aged 15 and 19yrs. We have stayed in many hotels in many countries and taken many different types of holidays and it's safe to say we are fairly 'fussy' but for a 5 star all inclusive relaxing holiday in the sunshine, we would highly recommend the Riu Palace Tikida. The staff are the friendliest we have ever encountered anywhere. From waiters, to pool assistants nothing was ever too much trouble. Having read some previous reviews on here about the odd 'grumpy member of staff' particularly during the month of Ramadan we were slightly concerned, as our week coincided with the last week of Ramadan. However we had nothing to be concerned about and every single member of staff was extremely friendly, remembering…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2015,4,Return visit (Dissapointment),"Returned to Riu Palace for the 4th time this time bringing along 18 friends to celebrate 2 birthdays. Prior to arrival requested a top floor room and received and E mailed response acknowledgement of request.On arrival had a 2nd floor room and requested to be moved, told it would be following day. Moved to top floor next day and had 2 sleepless nights with noise on the roof. Reception staff informed after second night that work was completed and no more noise would be heard, 3rd night of noise, now totally shattered, moved again to another room. Not the start to the holiday I was hoping for Positives the staff were helpful, friendly and efficient in all bars and restaurants, food and drinks lovely. A little gripe was that even though informing restaurant staff early in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,Outstanding Hotel,"Great Hotel, great staff, great time! Not sure how anybody could complain but each to their own. Always got a sunbed where we wanted it (although I am an early riser so was always one of the first down) no problems reserving sunbeds & found the pool staff very helpful. Entertainment staff were always cheerful & love to stop and have a chat. Special mention to Rachiiid, who is just life & soul of the hotel. We did tip certain staff but to be honest all staff are happy to help & put themselves out for you. Food choice is excellent, highly recommend the Krystal restaurant, the steak was to die for! Would definitely visit this hotel again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,Great holiday,"The hotel was built apparently only a few years ago and this provides a major benefit. I would recommend paying the extra and getting a pool view. Also I would recommend bringing the best mosquito plug ins and sprays you can buy! The food was very good indeed, with a wide variety. The main restaurant was large and a sheltered in darkness! Which was a shame in the morning for breakfast but a welcome retreat for dinner after too much sun! The lunch area was perfect for somewhere to eat in a lighter environment. You certainly won’t find the food ""samey"" or repetitive if you try a few new things and avoid simply going to the same counter every day. The a la carte restaurants were varying in their quality, I thought. The Krystal’s modern cuisine was superb as was the red wine.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,4,Loved Agadir,Lovely hotel and the rooms where a good size but the beds where very hard we did opt for a pool view but the balcony wall was so high when you sat on it you faced a wall which was a bit disappointing the restaurant always had a good choice of food so if you didn't find something to eat then you are very fussy went to the specialty restaurants which where very nice they do have an Italian which opened in high season I thought July would have been but nobody seem to know when this would open lovely pool area there is no waiters round the pool to get drinks you have to get them yourself we also went to the swim up bar waited 20 mins for a drink and gave up the bar staff didn't seem to be very happy with the exception of a couple but this may have been due to Ramadan overall I…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,Excellent Hotel,"Firstly let me start by saying this hotel is fantastic. We stayed for 10 days from 06 July. First impression was just WOW !!!!!! Room was amazing, very clean and spacious. Staff at the hotel were fantastic and couldn't do enough to help you, AZIZ behind the bar was fantastic, always had a smile and brilliant service, that goes for all the staff but Aziz needs a special mention. The food was of excellent quality and something for every bodies taste, fresh food constantly being cooked so always hot and fresh. As with all reviews there are a few negatives, The bar ran out of a couple of spirits on a couple of occasions (Vodka and white rum) there was still plenty of choice though. We ate at the Moroccan themed restaurant, which was great, however could not get into the Steak…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2014,3,Nice hotel... Strange happenings,"I'll start with the negatives to get them out the way... When we arrived we were put in a room without a balcony, apparently that happens a lot to English people. Went to reception and said we were unhappy they asked us to stay in the room for the night which we refused as we had paid for a room with a balcony, fortunately we were moved an hour later. We then were woken up early on 2 occasions as there was a man painting our balcony which was very annoying and unpleasant, also the fruit bowl we were given as an apology was mainly eaten by the cleaners! Positives... Food was excellent and at meal times you are given a bottle of which every colour wine you wished and all very nice, the hotel pool was very nice and clean as were the rooms. The hotel is in a very good location right…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,High quality break,Delighted with overall experience. Well managed hotel with great staff who seemed happy to work there & in the restaurants and bars. Special mention for Taim who looked after us every day at lunch. Food and drinks all of a very good standard. Will definitely go back again.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,Great Holiday,"I have just returned and had a great holiday - no matter what role the staff were performing they were friendly and helpful - hotel is large and clean and the food and drink is of a high standard - the only two things that need attention are the sun beds, unless you are prepared to get up at 6am you have no chance in getting a bed which is a joke and the entertainment in the evening is poor which with little cost could be resolved as it is more like Pontins and less 5*, but overall i will use Riu Hotels again",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,The Best Hotel Experience,"The staff at this holiday really go the extra mile. They are so efficient, warm and friendly. They are more than happy to help people that need assistance. The hotel are lucky to have to a wonderful, professional and caring team. all from the garden staff, pool, hospitality staff. The animation team and their shows were spectacular and made a big part of my holiday so special. I did not want to leave the hotel or the staff/friends I made.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,5,The perfect end to our honeymoon,"For our honeymoon in April, we had planned a two week Moroccan stay. Week one was for culture immersion in Marrakech, and the second one we chose to relax by the beach in Agadir. Having transferred from a 4* Riu resort, we were surprised by the difference once we arrived at this 5* Riu. The building was much more impressive, the decor, the facilities etc. And the service was second to none. The staff could not do more for you if they tried. THE ROOM We got a 4th floor room, which was incredible. We didn't have a pool or sea view, but even still, we made good use of the balcony. The room set up was lovely, with a brilliant bathroom (with two sinks), a dressing area as well as the bedroom and combined living area. The mini bar was topped up daily with branded pop, local beer and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2015,4,"Absolutely AMAZINGGG, 5*","The reviews for this hotel are generally very accurate, nothing is too much for the staff, they are always smiling and willing to help especially the bar lady in the lobby. The food is very varied and tasty, I was able to find something to eat for the entire week I was there despite being a VERY fussy eater. The drinks are lovely however cocktails can be a little too sweet without sufficient ice. The rooms are modern and cosy, the beach view is amazing and definitely worth it if you can get it. The hotel is visually stunning amazing artwork and furniture. The pool is absolutely beauty but you will need to wake up early to get a sunbed. This hotel truly caters for all different groups and respects Moroccan culture. This hotel is pricey but you do get what you pay for, I will…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2015,5,Gorgeous 5* Hotel,"Food was great, such a choice and the Krystal restaurant is a must! Gardens are immaculately kept. Location was great, right on the beach and opposite shops selling lots of lovely things. Rooms were huge and of a very high standard. Had some of the best nights sleeps in ages, beds were very comfy! Both pools were lovely and the swim up bar was great even though the service was a bit slow there. Sun loungers were the best we have ever had with thick mattresses for all wooden loungers, they even have table sides that pull out from underneath them for your poolside cocktail, great idea!!! My only negative would be the miscommunication with the staff. There was not one time we ordered drinks from any of the bars or waiters that came correctly? Not sure if the staff are all English…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

On entry into the hotel , the lobby has a real wow factor. It is big, luxuriously decorated and furnished and very comfortable . We have never spent as much time relaxixing in the lobby! I loved the fresh rose petals in the indoor water feature and the artwork around the lobby was also very attractive. The entrance to the main restaurant was within the lobby and it was also the place where dancers and performers would sometimes show some of their acts before dinner. The room was fantastic.

So we thought we'd put our two pence in. First impressions, extremely grand, beautiful and modern layout. If your a sloppy romantic couple at heart, this place is for you. We were greeted with a fruity punch on arrival, and a smile at the front desk straightaway. The hotel is also very secure with plenty of security. Rooms were spectacular, took our breaths away.

Positives: To start with, from the night that we arrived it was great to see the duty manager, Alberto, walking around the hotel and not hidden away in an office. He was often talking to guests and ensuring every need was catered for. We even saw him clearing tables in the restaurant one night! The food in the both the main restaurant and the snack bar was good, with a great variety and not once did we find it repetitive. We tried both the Moroccan and Krystal a la carte restaurant (I would advise booking as soon as you arrive to avoid disappointment as they get very busy). The Moroccan was a great opportunity to try traditional food which was cooked really well and very tasty. The Krystal restaurant is a fine dining…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

As we were here during the tragic events which occurred in Tunisia my partner became very unsettled so i spoke to Alberto the hotel manager, who quickly made my partner feel at ease again he assured us of all the safety measures the hotel and the Moroccan government had in place to protect its tourists.

Food – buffet, but so much choice & to a high standard. Drinks were brought to your table once you sat down, if you ordered a Rose they’d bring you a bottle & a bottle of water, or if you wanted a Diet Coke they’d also just bring you a bottle of that. Staff – very friendly & helpful all around the hotel Drinks – original spirits, yes I was shocked as I have never stayed at an AI without having to pay extra. Extensive drinks & cocktails menu.

 May 2015,5,Fantastic place to relax,"We stayed here the 2nd week of May as part of our Honeymoon. Having spent the first week at Riu Tikida Palmeraie in Marrakech we had already experienced a high level of service and we were not disappointed. We were fortunate enough to travel between the two during the day, thus avoiding the late night / early am arrival that flying from Gatwick/Manchester will entail. On arrival the check-in was friendly, efficient and in no time at all we seemed to be on our way to our room with an assurance that our luggage would soon follow. It did indeed and in a pretty quick time. Our 'junior' suite was enormous with a TV that rotated 360 degrees to allow you to watch from the sofa, table on one side of the room, or indeed the bed.

The reception area is huge with lots of nice comfortable seating areas to relax in. The rooms themselves are nice and clean, but we had our 1 year old with us and found the steps to the lower level a worry as she had started walking. However, we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway. The food was good with plenty of choice although only available at set times during the day.

The swimming pool is exellent and huge with different zones. There is animation during the day with hidrogym classes and also night shows for entertaining. The food at the buffet is good and well served. The beach is only a few meters away with a private area for the hotel guests. Two less positive aspects: it was not possible to book the Fusion restaurant because it was full for 5 days...Also no wifi in the rooms, only in the main lobby. Great option for a few days at the beach in all inclusive style.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our Thomson travel agent informed the hotel of our celebration, as did my husband, via email direct to the hotel reception, however our polite request for a pool view room was ignored, and there was no recognition of our celebration (even though there were others receiving free upgrades & champagne / fruit hampers in their rooms). So this was rather disappointing. We were allocated a ground floor room, which offered no privacy at all, as other people were persistently walking past our room to the pool & staring in.

I know some people tip all the time, but this is not expected, but they are appreciative of a tip when given. The transfer is about half an hour so perfect. Yes we did have to reserve beds but I think that was more for the brolly and not the bed, cause we saw empty beds each day. Pool is a nice size.

The delights in the restaurant were amazing. This was our third stay at the hotel we were so please we chose to go back.

 June 2015,5,Gr8 holiday destination,"A lovely hotel with everything you would want in a holiday! The management, restaurant and bar staff were mostly amazing. Although it's Ramadan and they're all fasting still can't do enough to keep you happy. The reception staff could be friendlier. As with all hotels could do with some improvements including cater for veggies better especially at dinner times. Went with my son and we were looked after very well. The location of the hotel is just perfect. A lovely sandy beach. Short walk to the shops and a longer walk takes you to the marina. Beautiful views from wherever you are! Cheap taxi ride to local places including the souk... So if you like haggling a great place for bargains.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

First impressions were good, hotel lobby was huge & Check-in was quick & reception staff friendly & helpful, we were directed to our room which was down on the ground floor, we had booked a pool view room but realised on approach to the room this wasn't happening. We opened the door & wow what a room, we had been upgraded to a sea view suite, the room or should I say rooms were enormous, what a fantastic start to the holiday. Free mini bar (topped up daily), tea & coffee making facilities, rooms cleaned daily to a very high standard. Pool area & gardens were spacious & well kept. I have to agree with other travellers the reserving of Sun beds at silly o'clock in the morning was annoying although we…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2015,5,Perfect hotel in Agadir,"Simply Perfect for families.It is a very nice beach hotel in the touristic area of Agadir. The check in process was fast and we got our room within 5 minutes. Tip: pick pick rooms on the inside with pool view (even numbers) - If you are given a room with street view go to reception and they will check availability and give you a nice one for a small daily fee. Tip2: the free WiFi is perfect as long as you are in the lobby - restaurant - pool area. If not, you will suffer a bit. The food was great with a variety of international and local dishes and a theme night (Spanish, Italian, Moroccan) The service was superb, especially our good friend Achraf. We took a stroll on the corniche, walked down the beach and we even rode a camel (150dhs for 15 min ride is worth every cent - you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We had fresh flowers, fruit and desserts waiting for us in our room to congratulate us. Also had the same and a bottle of champagne delivered to our room in the morning of my birthday which was a nice touch. Entertainment staff are friendly and never stop all day. I have to say however I am really impressed with both the housekeeping staff and the general manager.

 June 2015,4,"a palace worth going to, minus a couple of points for improvement.","Stayed for a week end of June. The hotel grounds and amenities are excellent and defiantly on par with a 4/5 star hotel. There are a couple of points to bear in mind. 1. Fo I do tends to be quite repetitive and not the best options for vegetarians. We b ended up becoming creative with what was provided and asking the cooks to make us dishes. 2. Evening entertainment is not the best. In fact in most cases people are in this section to have a drink and use the wife. 3. Even though it is written in there policies that sun beds are not to be reserved, they are still being reserved. This resulted in us also participating in this activity, which was not so bad as we tended to get up early anyway, but you would have to be up and willing by 7th to get the good beds,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Any rooms far away from the lobby area will have no wifi as the Internet is restricted to this location only and not in the rooms.

A special mention to Aiyab from the bar staff, thank you for looking after us. We arrived late in the evening and were shown through to the dining room for refreshments. The room was spotlessly clean, with tea making facilities, mini bar that was stocked every 2 days included in the price, hair dryer and toiletries in the bathroom. We walked to the marina, which takes about 30 minutes. The food is amazing with loads of choices even the fussiest eater could not go hungry. Pool area was lovely but you do have to put your towel out on a sunbed or you may not get one. I have never had to do this before.

 June 2015,5,Summer holiday,An excellent holiday superb accommodation and food. Red wine a bit rough rose white and cava pallitable but better quality served in a la carte and Moroccan themed restuarants which can be reserved as many times as bookings permit. There is no need to tip for better service although we did where we thought merited. Also used the courtesy transport to the Soliel golf course where Khalib the pro was very knowledgeable and despite my husband receiving a 30 minute putting lesson he actually spent all morning with us I think it also helped him support Ramadan. We did not feel the need to eat out but on our last night we ate in Agadirs no. 1 restuarant Pure Passion which was excellent value for money.

All inclusive buffet good but a bit repetitive for me as I am a very fussy eater! Room was huge, massive bed, bathroom was huge with a his and hers sink, very large bath and shower. Separate seating area, balcony. Our room was on the top floor on the left hand side of reception with a side sea view. The corridors are very quiet, no noise at all.

We are Riu Classe members and were very disappointed not to be recognised as such by the reception staff. In general they are quite unwelcoming and not a good advert for the hotel. The room they gave us overlooked a flat roof and a car park, so we went back to ask for a better on. We thought that booking direct with the hotel we would get a better room as we had previously been told that if you book through a tour operator you do not get the best ones. However, they gave us another room on the ground floor which was acceptable.

On arrival, we were greeted with a cocktail and shown to our room. After reading reviews on here, I emailed the hotel prior to our arrival, requesting a room on a high floor with a pool view. I'd definitely recommend doing this as we were given a lovely corner room on the top floor, which was more spacious than many of the others. Our room had a contemporary Moroccan feel with dark wood furniture and tasteful décor. The bed was large and comfy, there were plenty of plug sockets - very handy for us girls & gadgets!

 June 2015,3,"Nice hotel, but not a 5*","My wife and I spent 11 nights here having travelled with Thomson. The weather in Agadir was fantastic. It was hot during the day with a nice sea breeze to keep you cool, whilst the evenings were much cooler and pleasant for eating on the terrace. It's worth noting that men have to wear trousers in all the restaurants in the hotel, not just the a la carte ones, so there is little need for shorts other than to swim in. Overall the staff were very friendly and happy to help. The only exception we found were the staff on the reception desk. Everything seemed to be too taxing for them, and we were made to feel that we were inconveniencing them every time we asked for help. Check-in was a bit of a nightmare. We had to wait 45 minutes in a queue that was almost out of the main…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Bar staff were efficient and friendly, a big thanks to Faizal and Aziz! Animation team were better than average. Downfalls: Spa - apparently the sauna is by reservation only and then for only 20 minutes at a charge of 100 dirhams per person. Just who takes just 20 minutes for a sauna? All previous spa hotels we've visited there's been open access to the sauna and steam rooms for guests. Here there's not even the option to purchase a week pass. Dangers: we witnessed a couple of guests being injured by flying parasols!

It was all-inclusive with a huge choice of food which we never tired of, again the staff were very good .

The resort is very clean and the staff really make this hotel an amazing place. The food choice is fab with everything you want and more including two themed restaurants. The lobby area in the hotel is great to relax and unwind.The hotel was very busy on our second stay and seemed to have a 'sun bed squad' feel which was rather annoying as some days you could not find a sunbed by the pool. I noticed it was a bit of a mixed crowd of guests too on my second stay compared to my first stay. However, we still had a great holiday in Morocco and the hotel is still great.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2015,5,Fantastic stay,"Just returned from this hotel after a fantastic weeks stay. It's around a 25 minute coach trip from Agadir airport. We were greeted with drinks on arrival whilst checking in. The checking in process could have been a little quicker. We were given room 4067, this was right next to a fire exit with stairs onto the street. After asking to swap at reception we were quickly moved and offered help with our luggage. We were then given room 3039 which had a nice view of a neighbouring hotel. The staff at reception were very attentive. Try and get a room with a pool view, this is usually chargeable but if you don't ask you don't get. If not try and get a room with a sea view.

 June 2015,5,Still an excellent choice,"Back in Agadir after an 18 month break, it was nice to see if the Riu Palace was still as good. Much is the same, the rooms are generally excellent, the food too still ranks as the best daily buffet we've experienced. Overall then, things are good - there have been improvements in some areas too, the nightly entertainment is often of a higher standard than before - it's a shame the hotel dont make more effort to promote the shows - which often played to sparse audiences. The no-smoking indoors policy has been maintained, and this for me was one of the biggest improvements, making the bar and foyer lounge much more pleasant. The a la carte choices are both worth recommending, and the wine choices in each venue are superior to the house wine in the buffet. The service is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with a drink, which was a nice touch as we arrived late at night. Check in was simple and quick and the staff were pleasant and helpful & directed us to our room. The room was amazing and very clean and was very well decorated, which is how it stayed for the rest of the week!

They then shout at you when you have no money on you to tip! Arriving late at the hotel we were impressed with the quick check in and pleasant staff. You are left to find your room which is fine as it's pretty simple but our card key wouldn't work to get in the room. We walked back to reception and they said someone would come and fix it.

 June 2015,4,Good hotel and will return,"Just returned from staying at this hotel. And have to say the hotel and surrounding area exceeded my expectations. Upon landing at Agadir Airport one thing to note is that you have to complete a white landing card which for some reason is not handed out on the flight. Otherwise very straight forward. Once through security and you have collected your luggage the Thomson rep was waiting to direct you to the transfer bus. You will not need help with your luggage as the bus is directly outside. Once you arrive at the hotel, the check-in is very easy and we did not have to wait too long.

Hard to get more than 2 medium bottles of water in the room without being able to track down the minibar guy (who comes at any time of day), call reception (they don't deliver water after 10pm), go the bar (they don't give water bottles out?) etc. Don't be so tight with the water bottles - just hand them out.

The multi-level hotel with (strangely) the Reception on floor three, is very deceptive and confusing, especially when you have just arrived! After much hilarity and lots of walking around (in the dark!), we worked out how the flooring system worked.

Be wary though of mosquitoes - we both got bitten lots with some of mine becoming extremely infected and blistered. The maids opened the french windows whilst cleaning which allows them to fly in. We made sure to check the room when we returned from the pool in the afternoon and kill any which had managed to get in! Apart from that we couldn't recommend the place enough. We also went on the Magical Marrakesh…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2015,5,Fabulous! Should of stayed longer,"I think this is probably the biggest hotel in Agadir and I think it looks the best! I went with my daughter and we had a wonderful time. The staff were extremely friendly and look after you. Room was clean and tidy and very acceptable. Lots of choice on the food and drink too! I particularly like that when you have a glass of wine at lunch or dinner, or maybe a soft drink they leave you the rest of the bottle so that you feel it's your own `personal' bottle of wine. The sun took a while to get going on a few days, but once it's there it's wonderful. If I had to complain, it's that you've got to get up early to get your towels down on certain sunbeds if you have a particular location you want. That said there are plenty of sunbeds to go around, so you'll never not have…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2015,5,Superb hotel,"Just back after spending two weeks here. An absolutely superb hotel. The staff were really friendly and always eager to please, their language skills were excellent dealing with mainly Brits, Germans & French. The hotels attention to cleanliness was excellent always insuring rooms & public areas were spotlessly clean. The food in the four restaurants was great, huge variety catering for all tastes. The entertainment usually pretty amateurish at most hotels like this was very good and professional. The hotel was well situated close to the beach and the promenade, a wonderful place for an evening walk with other tourists and locals. Management was always on hand ensuring the hotel was running smoothly and listening to the views and concerns of the guests. If any criticisms can be…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The first a riu in cancun which was fantastic and the last The memories hotel in the Dominican Republic. Having has such a fabulous and exciting yet relaxing time at both we didn't think twice about booking an all inclusive resort again and as we had visited a Riu before and because the Tikida Palace is number one on trip advisor we chose it for this holiday.

The food was a little limited on that scale, but the Head Chef was great and did us a couple of dishes to our tastes. The pool area is clean with great bar staff too. The rooms are of an average standard. The only complaint I had was that there is no shampoo or conditioner in any rooms! It's an all in one shower gel ( which was not that good either) so be prepared and take it with you. Also, having asked a number of times times to get the string to be fixed for hanging clothes over the bath, this was not done!!!

 June 2015,5,Practically Faultless Hotel,"I would like to start by stating this is the first review I have ever done, I felt it necessary as I checked the website almost daily to find a hotel to book and then once booked to check I was happy. This lasted until the day I arrived when I began to learn it was deserving of its high rating. I feel obliged to leave a review as all the little hints, tips and comments I read prior to arrival did help me once there. Prepare yourself, it is quite detailed. The Rooms Incredible! They are exactly like the pictures with 2 twin beds together, a sofa area and a table with two chairs along with the walk through wardrobe area and the bathroom. Most hotels would describe the room as a Junior Suite. We had a ground floor room, having booked a basic no pool or sea view room. It was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,Relaxing break,"We enjoyed a fabulous 10 days at this hotel from 25th May. I won't repeat all the good points from previous reviews, but can, in my opinion, validate them. Worth a taxi ride to the marina (approx £2) where you'll find lots of restaurants if you fancy a change. Be aware that the orange taxi's only take 3 passengers (insurance i presume) but white ones will take 4. We never return to the same hotel, but would make an exception for this one.

 February 2015,5,One Week of Happiness - Priceless,"This is a very good hotel. New, well appointed, excellent staff, great food and a superb pool. If you want beach it is hard to fault Agadir's strip of sand. In detail. We travelled with Thompson but on arrival paid an extra €600 to upgrade to a seaview suite. Its a good decision and was, we felt, well worth it. Our children are young so it all revolves around them. They had a wonderful time. The staff are largely Moroccan and are so very kind to little ones. Wherever they went they were treated so well and with such kindness. The pool system is large and segmented, and a good temperature. There is even a large indoor pool with Jacuzzi so over the course of the day we went from main pool, to indoor, to Jacuzzi, to bath, to bed. The only interruptions were meals. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Empty glasses are cleared away promptly by the hard working staff, beautiful garden areas and a 2 minute walk to the very wide sandy beach. Don't hesitate, book this holiday.

The staff would do anything for you. If you want a change just cross the road to a perfect restaurant where I had my first T-bone steak. Spent a very lot of time next to the excellent pool. The rooms are large with kettles so we didn't need to take our own. All I can say is if you don't like your stay in this hotel you must very hard to please.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Well we have been back 2 weeks and are planning to go again next year for our honeymoon! Nothing about this holiday can be negative! The hotel was large always spotless and great atmosphere! The food in both the a la carte restaurants and the buffet hall was excellent standard and lots of different choice each day. The hotel seemed full but never long wait for food or drinks and plenty of sun loungers available! Best thing without a doubt tho was the staff!

 July 2014,5,Very nice hotel,"We actually stayed here in June 14 & I am just writing this now. It was a very nice hotel. We arrived late, however, check in was a relatively smooth process. There was some food in the buffet left for us, but the lights weren’t on in the restaurant and there didn’t seem to be anyone about – however, we literally nibbled then went to our room after having a drink. We explored a little the next day and we were pleasantly surprised…. Having done the ultimate all inclusive in the Caribbean…. it’s difficult to get that out your head as a comparison. However, we were happy with our choice! We liked the choice of restaurants, it means a bit of variation from the buffet. There was Moroccan, krystal & an Italian. The Italian was the only one we weren’t keen on. The buffet was just as…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,4,Does what it says on the tin!,"stayed for two weeks in May 2015. Whilst this is advertised at 5* this is Moroccan rating, but a good 4*in our opinion. we booked taxi transfer having experience Moroccan entry before. Speedy friendly check in. Restaurant open late for UK arrivals, but food quantity poor. directions to room sketchy but we soon got there down the long corridor. Room as in brochure. Minibar stocked every other day, if you want more of any item just leave a note. Good cleaning standards. Food is only as repetitive as you make it, we would not recommend the 'steak' however. Didn't use the different restaurants on offer, but wished we had on checkout day as the restaurant was hectic.

 April 2015,5,A Great Place to relax,"Visited this hotel with my family and had a fantastic time. It was the cleanest hotel you'd ever wish to stay in. The all inclusive was great with good quality drinks and no hidden extras and the choice and variety of food was excellent. The gym was very basic and the indoor pool was very dark and could do with a deep clean. However, generally the staff were very friendly and professional. There was no shortage of activities for active guests. We went on a trip organised by Thomsons to the Atlas mountains which was informative and interesting, whilst our teenage kids went surfing for the day. All in all we found the hotel excellent value and would have no hesitation in returning again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

In total we paid £518.00 each, which is cheaper than Thomson and such a bargain for a very good all inclusive hotel. The room is plenty big enough for 3 adults, the sofa bed in the lounge area which gives plenty of room to walk around and you don't feel on top of each other.

I would add this was I out third day and we did not eat anywhere outside the hotel nor did we leave the hotel. I mentioned it on leaving and was told I was most welcome by the receptionist!!!

Ate in the buffet restaurant and the themed restaurants. They were excellent but I always felt a bit rushed in the buffet restaurant. Service was superb and the weather was great but always felt that if we went for a walk we would be pestered by tradesman selling their goods.

The transfer took about 35 minutes, and yes a lot of us arrived at once, but there were 4 members of staff checking us in so it didn't take long.

It was rather chaotic sometimes as you were not sure what you eat; for example only 2 salads were named out of 15. For me it was a bit challenging, as I eat gluten free (which they don't know what it is, so if you have any food allergies, be prepared to take some stuff from home).

 May 2015,5,11th. Time.,"This was our 11th time we have used this hotel for our holidays. We have not found a better hotel in Africa for our holidays. This hotel is very friendly not just the staff but guests as well We have made some good acquaintances over our holidays and keep meeting them again at this hotel. Many are repeat guests and have visited many times. The Chef puts on some excellent food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The quality and quantity are very good. All the staff are very attentive as long as they are treated with respect. I do not understand how anyone can complain about anything in this hotel, but people do expect the standard to be as good as the Caribbean or the Americas. This is Africa and as such the standard is of the very highest. We like this hotel so much we are…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,5,Excellent stay,"My wife and I arrived at the hotel on the 6th of April for a 1 week stay ( have just remembered to write a review but felt it worthwhile to do so! ) From the minute we arrived,we were treated fantastically well and all of the staff could not have been more helpful throughout our stay.Our room was immaculate and cleaned everyday with the fridge topped up daily with water,soft drinks and beer.When we arrived at our room, we realised that the fridge was not working,we called reception and and within 5 minutes someone had turned up to fix it,we were advised that the fridge could not be repaired so was taken away but was replaced within 10 minutes with a new one,very happy with the speed at which this was dealt with but not surprised as the staff could not do enough for us.We used…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,fantastic hotel,"we arrived late at night, approx 10.30 pm, had a very quick check in after a glass of cocktail which is waiting for you, put our case in the room and went to the bar. Our room was on the ground floor which they call level 1, reception is on level 3. we had room 1090 which is the 2nd room in on the left hand side, we didn't have much of a view, only the gardens but we also didn't have a long walk to the lobby or the buffet and restaurants. the way the rooms are situated is that if your nearer the sea you have a lot longer walk to the lobby. also our room kept lovely and cool as we didn't get the sun. rooms are all pretty much the same, 2 twin beds, seperate seating area, tv, seperate wardrobe area and toilet/bathroom. In the morning we went for breakfast which has a very…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,Great place to stay with the family,"This hotel is amazing, we stayed there for a week and could not fault it at all. It's exceptionally clean and stylish. All the staff were friendly to my four year old son, they greeted him by name. The food was great too, although it gets a little repetitive after a while. The try to change up the menu through the week allele though. At the back of the hotel is the promenade which is nice to cycle along. The are loads of bikes for hire everywhere. It did get a little rowdy once or twice, and we saw a group of lads fighting, but generally the whole resort of Agadir is welcoming and friendly.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,AMAZING HOTEL,"This has to be the best hotel we have ever stayed in, everything was perfect about this hotel the staff were so friendly a great choice of food, huge rooms if you do want a change from the hotel food there's a restaurant over the road make a reservation. We were so sad to leave and will definitely be going back.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,3,Hotel lovely - location ok - reception staff not ok!!,"We stayed for one week following a week in Riu in Marrakech. The hotel is faultless, spotlessly clean and plenty of room. The Krystal restaurant was Suberb and the barmen are all extremely happy and helpful! Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the Reception and Management, on arrival one of our rooms were unavailable (we had two rooms booked) so a female supervisor/manager informed us that if this was ok with us that she would offer us a late check out when we were to leave. However when checking out and talking to Hayat she was less than helpful, called us liars and pretty much ruined the whole week for us. The female manager that we first spoke to was clearly in too much of a rush to finish her shift that she did not make any notes on our behalf and seconds after…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,4,"Beautiful hotel, great people.","We stayed here from 18th-28th April and had a fantastic time. The hotel was beautiful from the reception area to the outdoor seating in the restaurant to the gardens. Just stunning! The colleagues working in the hotel were very nice. Ones that stood out were Yassine in the restaurant on an evening. Malika also in the restaurant mainly at lunch, Brahim on reception and Mohammed on the bar. The male restaurant supervisors were brilliant, always friendly with everyone and couldn't do enough to help you. The female supervisors were very good with male guests but were generally quite miserable otherwise. They were all great with kids, especially babies if if you are thinking of going as a family. Food was very nice. I know some people have put comments on about the food being…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,5,Another great Riu Hotel.,"My sister in law and I recently returned from a week at this excellent hotel. Much has been said in previous reviews about the excellent staff and standards of cleanliness, so I will just repeat that both are superb. We chose to go on the Marrakech trip, which was a very long day. Pick up was 6.30am and we did not return to the Hotel until after 11.00pm. The trip involves about 5 hours of walking on sometimes very uneven ground. It should be made clear that this trip is not suitable for people with mobility problems. Lunch was excellent but involved staggering up four flights of very steep stairs!!!! Perhaps only suitable for the very fit!! The other trip we did involved being showered, rubbed down with a mitt and massaged for an hour. This was fabulous, and we would highly…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is excellent in every respect and we will certainly return. We now tend to use the Riu chain of hotels as they have a consistent high level of service, food ,amenities and accommodation. This particular hotel has the added bonus of being located next to a lovely promenade and beach. We walked along the promenade in the morning and night and felt safe, although we were approached a lot by local traders, a polite no thank you, was enough to deter future attention. Lots of joggers and at the weekend a communal aerobics session on the seafront to the right of the hotel which was attended by about 300 locals. Watch out for the children on bikes ,I think they learn to ride here and some have not quite mastered the brakes. For footy fans the hotel has a large screen which…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,Lovely hotel... But not very vegetarian friendly!,"Beautiful hotel with beautiful grounds, close to the beach and lovely pool! Couldn't complain! However, warning to all vegetarians, none of the food is labelled so it is difficult to tell what is and is not suitable... For strict vegetarians like myself, even the chips are not suitable as they are cooked in the same oils as the fish and squid (you can see them being cooked)! Other than that one hiccup I would definitely recommend!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2015,5,Stunning,"I usually go self catering, so was a little nervous about being in the same place, eating the same night after night. I am completely converted, the place is beautiful, the staff are so friendly and polite, and the food is superb. They have a buffet for breakfast and dinner - with lots of food being cooked freshly in front of you. Lunch is the same with a seating area near the beach, lots of fresh fish, and an amazing array of salad. There are two a la carte restuarants you can book at no extra cost, and lots of snack bars and restaurants outside, if you do want something different. We had a massage in the spa- again very professional and relaxing. After speaking to others on the plane - I would recommend going for the Riu ""Palace"" for the extra cost the extra luxury is worth…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 April 2015,5,Excellent,"After reading lots of reviews about this hotel there is not much more to say that has not already been said, it is well set out, all staff have guests at the top of there list, this not only helps to make this hotel more relaxing , it helped us to enjoy our holiday even more than normal. I have read a review about the dining room seating arrangements, this was not true in our experience, we found by waiting to be seated we could indicated to the waitress an area in which we would like to be seated. Food varied and well cooked, bar service first class, entertainment was normal standard for Rui hotels. We never had a problem finding a decent spot near or around the pool area, in fact the sofa's in all of the outdoor areas were very comfy and plentiful.

I came with a friend and she wanted to do a few trips and I wanted to lounge by the pool. The whole holiday worked for both of us.

 April 2015,4,Good four star experience,"Stayed here for a week at the end of April 2015, celebrating my partner's birthday. Chose the Monday flights out of Manchester Qand everything was on time, flight experience was good and airport transfers very efficient with Thomson. Check in at the hotel was swift, with attentive porters and we were presented with a little cocktail to enjoy whilst we waited to be seen to. I had booked a room with a pool view and was disappointed to be given a first floor room with a view completely obscured by trees. I mentioned to the Thomson rep who swiftly arranged for us to be moved to the other side of the hotel on a higher floor with a superb view of the pool and sea. Whilst this was further from reception/bars/restaurant, it was worth it for the views. The room was great and very much as…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

What a great idea! There were 9 ladies in our party and I have to say that our mini break (4 nights) was absolutely wonderful. The hotel stands in it's own large grounds and has access to it's own private beach about 5 yards away in fact! Our rooms were lovely. Very spacious and spotlessly clean. The bathroom and the toilet were just the same and cleaned every day during out stay. Toiletries were provided for us as were lots of soft while towels. A point I feel I must mention. The shower is an over bath show and as the baths are really deep this may provide difficulties for a less able person. I don't know if there were…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We went back to reception later that evening with questions when it was quieter and staff were all very helpful. Lovely large clean room despite not being pool facing - we didn't mind this too much as everything else was superb. Amazing pool area, gym classes and lobby is spacious with lots of comfort seating - never over busy which we liked.

Attractive bar area with first class service Had excellent junior suite (3004) with sea view.Clean and fresh every day. Dining experience leaves something to be desired mainly because with so many guests the tables are very close together giving the impression of a staff canteen and the outside terrace dining area is woefully inadequate Should you be fortunate enough to be seated in this area you will i am sure have a completely different dining experience.This however does not detract from the first class quality of the food.

Still spotlessly clean everywhere and the food was very good in the main buffet - love the chicken or lamb tagines!! We didn't bother with the specialitiy restaurants at all. The staff are all great and so friendly - special thanks to Hamada in the lobby bar who is excellent and never lets your glass stay empty and is a really lovely guy! Enjoyed the entertainment in the Lobby bar (thanks Raschid for letting me sing a couple of songs) also the main room when the band was on. One thing I would mention is when leaving Agadir Airport don't bother with the VIP lounge - its really not worth it apart from the comfortable sofas!!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I think a hotel is only as good as its staff and they are brilliant here. Omar and Nora are just 2 out of the whole lot who go out of their way to make your stay lovely. The evening entertainment is ok. If you want to go out for dinner go across the road to the right and try Little Norway the food is awesome and they are very helpful, also take a trip to the marina to Perfect Passion for dinner the food is great and the hotel have a free courtesy agreement with them.

Having a young child the weather was about right although the clouds can be deceptive so make sure you cream up especially with children. The hotel is big, very clean, we had a junior suite on floor 4 which was ideal, although we overlooked the tennis courts, be aware reception is on floor 3 so would likley be the busiest area with people coming and going and you may want to stay clear. Pools are nice (but cold and the indoor pool was also cold)!

 April 2015,4,Wonderful hospitality,"We came to this hotel for a 10-day stay in April 2015 with two small children. The pools and common areas are fantastic; the rooms are well appointed. Our first room was not garden or pool view, which means we overlooked a concrete passageway where locals walked through to the sea, and we had a sliver of sea view. The beds and room were fine although wardrobe had a clothes rail far too high for a person of average height and the plug in the bathtub wouldn't keep water in. We changed to a ground floor room on the garden side and were happier all around; many thanks to assistant manager Raphael for helping us. Food and drinks were very good, but what really stood out was the staff. Yassine at the restaurant made our kids' meals special every time. All the servers and restsurant…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,5,Excellent,"Beautiful hotel of a high standard. If you like to be pampered then this is the place to go. Luxurious spacious rooms. High standard of cleanliness. Gorgeous gardens that are well maintained. Alcoholic drinks were branded and not local spirits. Even provide Cava for breakfast! Only annoying aspect was the constant pestering from locals, one after the other when you left the hotel. It is part of the deal in Morocco so just be prepared for it and politely put them off. Would certainly consider returning again. We were very lucky with the weather for mid April.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2015,4,Great stay But no in room wifi!,"I stayed in this hotel with my family in March half term. The room was great and very comfortable- we paid an extra £100 or so for a view of the pool which in my opinion was worth it. The spa was great my only complaint would be that it booked up very quickly sometimes you needed to book 4 days in advance! The food wa great however because slightly repetitive after a couple days but delicious all the same. The staff were lovely and helpful , and also a bit flirty haha. The only negative was that there was no wifi in the room which was quite anoying it wasn't even an option to pay extra for it which is just incredible in this day and age.

Rooms are spacious and cleaned regularly thoughout the stay. Food at the alacarte restaurants is very good, be sure to book early in your stay. The food at the main restaurant is good quality for an AI hotel, normally very fresh but avoid going towards the end of opening hours at lunchtime. If you ask for an international brand it might not be what you're expecting as we often watched staff empty local branded spirits into international bottles, only a minor irritation and local brands are still drinkable.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Bring sweaters/ pullovers during March/ early April time, you might need them early morning/ evening 5. Bring small change for tip, it was very difficult to get small change in dirham, we couldn’t even change them at the hotel. 6. Book the a la carte restaurant in advance to avoid disappointment 7.

However take them away and you have a boring hotel. The doors are so noisy and the cleaners start so early that there's no opportunity to lie in and the floors are so thin you here everything above . it feels like a prison. also if you don't have male companions then you won't safely be able to leave the hotel without being quite aggressively harassed .. The food was just a weird combination of everything chucked together and soooo repetitive and the evening entertainment was dull almost on par with a poor butlins site instead of 5* hotel.

Food very nice did not feel the need to go to the ala carte restaurants also we had heard bad revues but people we spoke to on our holiday said they were nice. Staff were very nice and friendly, rep even got a maintenance man to mend my suitcase as the wheel had fallen off in transit.

This was the true all inclusive experience we were looking for. The staff smiked arus and eachother. Everyone made their jobs appear effortless. Drinks were varied and well presented. The food was a little on the boring side for my taste but there was certainly something for everyone. Fresh fruit juice at breakfast with or without cava;-) cannot commend the mini club staff enough, they are top notch and really bond with the kids (and the parents). Shows were mostly entertaining.

They then stick out their hand for money and become very aggressive if you do not give them something. Being 18 and my boyfriend 20 at the time, we felt very out of our depth.

 August 2014,5,A great stay,"Not really sure where some people who have reviewed have actually stayed. To call this not a five star hotel is very unfair. I believe that for what is usually an all inclusive holiday, i absolutely got what i paid for. Yes the food is not incredible, but it is five star ALL-INCLUSIVE level. The staff were very good although a touch pushy for a tip at times. The pool was well looked after, very clean and the beds were nice.

 March 2015,4,Very good hotel not quite a 'Palace',"My husband and I stayed at the Riu Palace in March for 2 weeks. Our first impressions were not good as the reception area / lounge is very brown and dark, - not good when it rains and you can't go outside!!. This was not what we expected from previous stays in Riu Palace Hotels The check in staff were very unhelpful especially one lady member who was downright rude - not a good start!! The bedrooms are large and airy with a nice lounge area with two tables, two chairs and a sofa very good air conditioning/heating. We had a very hard bed - the management were very helpful with a mattress topper/quilt which helped slightly. I think we were unlucky as the people we were with said theirs was ok. The bathroom was good but very brown with a hairdryer on the wall but be warned there…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,3,Bland,"Having just returned from the Tikida Palace which gets otherwise glowing reviews I feel a little cheated. The rooms are as everyone has said large and clean but who wants to stay in the room all holiday? We were unfortunate with the weather with only 3 sunny days which is of course no ones fault but it did highlight the lack of any effort in the hotel to get the guests geed up. The animation team did their job, but with only a couple of the team seemingly to have any talent or personality it was all a bit forced and dull. No one spoke to us in any case until day 4 of our stay by which time my 14 year old son who was initially keen to mingle & join in just lost interest. There is very little for teens and it's not really a family hotel but geared more at couples, older people…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2015,5,Just the ticket to brighten the winter months!,"Travelled here with my daughter in February and had a wonderfully relaxing holiday. The hotel was spotlessly clean and never seemed too busy. Lots of nooks and crannies to relax in beautiful surroundings. Staff were extremely attentive without being intrusive, food was excellent and plentiful. We never had occasion to queue. The hotel spa was glorious and we had the best massage that we'd ever experienced. Well done and thank you Riu Tikida Palace.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2015,5,Agadir in style,Very large Hotel in a U shape towards the sea with two pools one of which is heated in the summer.. Stayed with a friend on a golfing holiday for one week the end of March. Pool although heated was cold but bearable. Usual towel problem with sunbeds even in March but pool attendant always found us one in the afternoon after golf. It just annoys me that people reserve sunbeds and don't use them but this seems to be a problem the world over.. Staff all seemed friendly with good service and the room was kept very clean. Had a slow running sink which was cleared without requesting. Restaurant food was excellent which lots being freshly cooked and a good choice but after a week I had had enough of man versus food! We found it nicer on the terrace outside as it was not as noisy as the…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2015,3,THREE STAR HOTEL IN A FIVE STAR JACKET,"Maybe our travel agence did not understand our demands very well, because they send us to this Riu Hotel. We want a calm, quiet resort where we can rest for one week and we did not find rest at all in this resort. We had just one demand, a quiet room on the fourth floor and they put us on the second floor above a room with crying baby who wakes us every day at 05.30 am.... I will not let here whole pages of complain on this page but just give you my opinion with some words: IF YOU LIKE: GOOD STAFF GOOD FOOD VERY BAD ISOLATED ROOMS (every morning waked up by crying baby's or the cleaners who are starting at 8am with removing all the furniture above and besite us, I even here my neigbours sneezing) VERY CROWDY REFTER AT BREAKFAST WITH QUE FOR EGS AND PANCAKES VERY CROWDY…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,5,Head and shoulders above the rest,"We chose this hotel because it was our first trip to Agadir and we did not want to take any chances, how right we were. We walked along the promenade on a number of occasions and the Riu Palace has everything on the others, Its location, its size and its appearance. Its a great feeling when you return knowing that you are at the best. The pool area is amazing with the building on three sides and a raised embankment on the open side towards the promenade giving the pool area some privacy from the passers by. The area is provided for by the pool bar serving alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks for the periods that the pool is open, there is also the restaurant for mid day meals. The main Restaurants and Bar area are off the lobby, ground on entering but the third floor beach side.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,5,Second visit and still fabulous,"Still here and sat in the pool bar thinking how brilliant this hotel is. Just wonderful. Delicious food, attentive staff, stylish decor, top notch facilities, wonderful Spa. Just love it here and so do my parents! Rooms are a great size but definitely worth upgrading to pool view. If your thinking about visiting Agadir then this has to be the hotel to book.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2015,5,Great hotel,"We have just returned from a lovely holiday with friends in Agadir. This is our 4th time, 3rd at this time of year. The weather was disappointing for the first three days - unusual to have rain, but the sun appeared in the afternoon except Sunday when it rained all day. sun came out on Monday for a week then the mist descended for three more days. This is very unusual weather believe me, or we wouldn't keep going back! The hotel has been open 4 years, and is showing some signs of disrepair, but I can see where things have been replaced and the staff are very quick to replace loose tiles. The rooms are well furnished. We were given a suite which was a surprise as they are quite a bit more expensive. The staff around the hotel are very friendly and the management are always to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,Great All-Inclusive Resort,"My wife and some friends of mine stayed at this hotel in May 2014; just getting around to writing about it. Overall, this resort is one of the best All-Inclusive resorts that I have stayed at. The service was great and the food was very impressive. The mixed drinks were pretty good, but I could not be to picky as the people making it have no clue how they taste! The rooms were clean and very modern. The beach area was nice and it was good that the hotels area is marked off. The hotel is located in a nice enough area to go out shopping and you still feel safe. Day trips proved to be a bust; don't waste your time on going to Marrakesh. We did enjoy the camel ride excursion. I will more than likely be returning to this resort.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,4,Great quality,"Currently here on an Easter sunshine break, only problem is there's no flipping sun! Beware that in the morning there is a thick sea mist/ cloud that may or may not shift throughout the day. If your a sun worshiper consider this before booking!! The hotel is great, quality, clean, staff in abundance and smart & approachable. The food has been fantastic! Plenty of choice, healthy and bad! But all fresh and casters for all tastes. Entertainment has been a little weak. Staff very friendly, but the show quality is very poor. For this level of hotel (and for what u pay) the shows are disappointing. They have a great stage, lights, costumes, fab bar but it's a little ""buttlins"" if it wasn't for the 2 x breakdancers (who are incredible) they would have lost the crowd. Plus shows don't…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2015,5,wow,"After encountering the miserable officials & over keen porters at Agadir airport we arrived at this wonderful hotel. Greeted with arm bands and a cocktail & quickly checked in. How anybody could find fault with this hotel is beyond me. It is superb. Everyone of the staff were always happy, working hard & smart looking. Never saw anybody doing nothing, amazing. The room was kept spotless as was the rest of the hotel. The gardens are virtually weed free & the pool area always being cleaned. The spa was very good also. Recommend the hamman & massage. Food was amazing with so much choice & variety everyday. Sheer indulgence. Especially also loved the singer in the bar in evenings who was also singer of the band on live music nights.

 March 2015,5,Fabulous holiday,"We have just returned from the most amazing week in Agadir. Our 2nd visit to the Riu Palace and we couldn't fault anything at all. The staff are so attentive. Always smiling and nothing is too much trouble. Our first visit was as a couple but we had our latest trip with our grown up family and grandaughter aged 2. I have seen people complaining about the weather but surely that is the luck of the draw and in no way can be seen as a review of the hotel? We were lucky after a couple of days of wind and lots of sunshine, it settled down into wonderful hot weather. But hey it was so much hotter than the Uk and we were round the pool every day being waited on with coffees and cocktails by the lovely staff. The food was excellent and the rooms were amazing.

We would definitely recommend and look to return here.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2015,4,Disappointing Weather,"Last day - and compelled to write this as I sit and stare at the grey sky again from the balcony. All elements of the hotel - as last time were superb ... The staff really make this place what it is !! Honestly though, a few communal areas starting to show signs of wear and tear, especially by the pool (cracked tiles etc - actually causing some holiday makers to fall). The MAJOR IRRITATION WAS THE WEATHER! Forget checking websites (including BBC) for weather... the frustrating thing about the weather is that the hotel is situated in such a place on the shoreline that the area literally attracts the low cloud ON SOME DAYS ...

 March 2015,4,Genuine 5 *,I stayed here for a week and enjoyed almost every part of it. The check in was very swift and friendly. Staff and rooms were outstanding.

 March 2015,5,Marvelous Morocco,"Returned last week from a 'so chilled out' hotel.

Great stuff.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The rooms are lovely & spacious, with a powerful shower (choice of 2 shower heads) beautiful pool area with good quality wooden sun loungers with thick mattresses & towels are provided so no need to pack beach towels. No shortage of Food & drink, food was excellent & I highly recommend the optimist cocktail! The whole hotel is spotlessly clean & all of the staff that we encountered were lovely. I would definitely recommend this hotel & will be looking at other Riu hotels for my next holiday.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,5,Amazing!!,"Fantastic hotel can't reccomend enough, and great choice of food and drink! Rooms always clean. Deffo be back again! However the beach isn't as private as you have the locals on the same beach, and people try and sell you things on the way down to it. Other than that I had a great time!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2015,4,Lovely hotel-shame about the weather,"Just returned from our first visit to Morocco. The weather was truly horrendous-rain and wind with a few hours sunshine. Thank goodness we had chosen such a nice hotel as the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir which had been recommended by several friends. Lovely big room and bathroom and very clean. The pool area was very spacious and well thought out although the many signs regarding rules about not saving sunbeds, like many places, was completely ignored by guests and not enforced by staff. This was hugely annoying on the few occasions it was fit to attempt to sunbathe. All of the prime spots out of the wind were reserved very early in the morning and sometimes not occupied until much later in the day. Only one other negative and that was the scarcity of staff in the bar area in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,Fab Hotel,Just a Fab hotel. Rooms spacious and clean. Comfy bed which is important to us. Food varied and plentiful couldn't fault the food at all. EXCEPT the 2 a la carte restaurants. Just NO atmosphere in either and considering there is no extra charge they should be a lot busier. The lighting and spacing of the tables were all wrong. The foyer in the evening is buzzing with atmosphere. Entertainment A+,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2015,5,Another great Riu experience,"Just returned from an excellent 11-day holiday at Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. Very good three-and-a-half hour Thomson flight, bit of a delay getting through immigration, etc. at Agadir airport, but luggage was available when we arrived at carousel. Directed to coach and a half hour trip to the hotel. Welcomed by entertainment team, and a cocktail, with prompt check-in procedure. Had requested a room on a high floor and were pointed in the direction of a room on the top floor (fourth). Reception together with the main restaurants, theatre and lobby bar are on the third floor.

Currently sat in the bar overlooking the poor and sea and sun shining down, gorgeous! I guess the hotel is 5* for Morocco which will be different to international cities around the world, however it's a quality 4* hotel. Why? The staff are so lovely, helpful, yes they can be a little slow but hey your on holiday to relax. The management are always visible around the hotel throughout the day and they clearly direct a well run operation. Rooms are large, comfortable, daily top up of mini bar and kept very clean.

 March 2015,5,Best hotel,"This is by far the best hotel that my husband and I have stayed at. A warm welcome with a quick and easy check in followed by our bags taken to our room. The room itself was spacious had a lovely balcony with pool view... Definitely worth the extra for view. The ensuite was again spacious with our own sink each! Loved the layout of the room with a sofa and a little table and chairs... More like a little flat than a room. All the staff were lovely and always there to help if you wanted it.

The food was amazing with plenty of choice and it was always hot with many dishes cooked fresh to order while you waited. The pool area was clean and tidy at all times and all indoor areas of the hotel were immaculate. The only thing that was a little disappointing was the evening entertainment.

 September 2014,5,Stunning hotel,Visited this hotel as a couple in September. Had never been to a Riu hotel or Morocco before but was pleasantly surprised by both! I would say it's probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in and would definitely return at some point. The hotel is really modern and has an amazing lobby area. The rooms are massive and each have a separate living area. The pool area is lovely. Lots of sun beds. Some really nice ones with a double mattress but you need to be up early if you want to bag these! Most people tend to sit at the pool as there is only a small reserved area at the beach and we found that it could get quite windy and cold. The beach is nice and clean though. The food was great.

We were on the cooler side of the building so it was a bit chilly on the balcony....but hey you don't spend much time in them room anyway. The in room fridge has soft drinks and two beers provided each day.

 February 2015,4,A Golfing Cruise ship in Dry Dock...............................,"This is probably the toughest review I’ve had to do to date. For one simple reason. The previous reviewers are correct in there summary of brilliant facilities in the hotel. The small, but functional gym, the well-stocked bar. Even the fact that there are 3 bookable Restaurants and a fourth Buffet one. But there are a couple of things I struggled with in this massive establishment and therefore it’s probably more about some of the clientele than the hotel itself I have an issue with! The staff are an absolute credit to RIU. But I’m not shocked by the standards here, as these are the same at other RIU hotels we’ve stayed at. The staff are always great.

 June 2014,4,"Lovely hotel, great relaxing holiday","My boyfriend and I decided to visit Morocco for a week in June and we chose this hotel because of Riu's good reputation for quality. The hotel was nice and clean, modern and airy. The pools are lovely. Unfortunately, you need to be up at the crack of dawn to get a sun bed by the pool which is really frustrating. People seem to have 'saved' all the sunbeds with towels even though this is not meant to be allowed. Its very frustrating when you have planned a relaxing, sunbathing holiday. The hotel is right on the promenade for the beach, but it does get very windy so the pool is preferable. We did manage to squeeze ourselves into sunbathing spaces by the pool on most days, it was just quite a strenuous task and put a bit of a dampener on things. The bar and service was good.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Great choice of food in the main restaurant at lunchtime and dinner. We went to two other restaurants too, and they were good. Wine in the main restaurant isn't good.They serve better wine in the Crystal restaurant. There is no filtered coffee at breakfast but you can get it from the bar in the main area.

The holiday as a whole was a mixed bag, but there was little we could fault with the hotel especially considering it was such good value for money. Airport Arrivals and transfer It was our first time in Agadir, so here are some points that might help others going there for the first time. Firstly, make sure you complete the landing form while still onboard the plane because you will come to passport control as soon as you step into the terminal building. Secondly, they only allow one person as a time at the passport control desks, so don’t try to walk up with the whole family.

Enjoyed belly dancing class with the animation team. Would highly recommend this hotel. Pat and David Ford",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2015,1,Terrible customer service,"Like another member's post, I was not even able to stay at the hotel due to absolutely horrible customer service through their booking agency. I originally tried to book two rooms for three nights, but due to technical issues with the site, only one reservation went through. I called back two days later to remedy the situation but in the 2 days difference, the hotel had changed their booking policy to a 5 night minimum stay. They promised to call me back in 48 hours with news on creating a new reservation and never did. I called back and this time they promised to call back within 24 hours. Again, no one contacted me. I called one last time and they refused to accommodate my request even though there was plenty of availability. I'm glad now that I cancelled the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2015,5,Simply perfect!,"Came to this hotel for a cheeky week to wash away the February blues and got more than I wished for. The hotel is furnished beautifully, staff can't do enough for you and the food is excellent. The lunchtime buffet sat outside is great! There are plenty of sun loungers and if you don't fancy that there's plenty of places to sit or lounge around. The only little tiny thing I have to say is that to keep you off the grass in certain areas they use red and white tape instead of an attractive rope or chain but I think I might be grasping at straws to find fault. Definitely be visiting this hotel again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Food is so plentiful & well presented with so much choice you don't know which way to turn. Most of it being cooked while you watch. 24 hour bar if you need it with drinks both in the bars & the wine in the restaurant being of good quality.

 February 2015,1,Can't even make a reservation,"I have spent several days trying to make a reservation at this hotel. When I called on Saturday they told me to call back Monday. On Monday they told me to call back Tuesday. On Tuesday they gave me a phone number to call for reservations that was out of service. When I called back to the main hotel number, I was again given this phone number that is out of service despite the fact that I assured them that it was out of order. Finally, after my 5th phone call, they actually connected me to the reservations office. However, they informed me that they CANNOT guarantee connecting rooms. How is a family supposed to travel with children when connecting rooms cannot be guaranteed?

We emailed a week before we arrived and requested a sunny room on the fourth floor and that's exactly what we got. Rooms are spacious and airy and the decor throughout the hotel is chic and luxurious. There is no mad scramble for sun loungers in the morning ( hooray ) and although the hotel isn't huge it feels spacious enough with plenty of loungers and day beds for everyone. The food is of a good standard but not always piping hot, drinks are good although no one does a cocktail as well as a Caribbean hotel. My hubby insures me the lager is good and not gassy.

On our arrival we were greeted with a nice drink and a warm welcome from the reception staff. Check in was quick and before long we were in our room. Rooms are really nice and spacious, with tea and coffee facilitys and a mini bar. We had a partial sea view which was fine as we did not intend staying in the room long, we wanted to enjoy the lovely warm weather. The weather was really lovley the whole week, the mornings are chilly and you would need ladies long trousers and light jacket or jumper/cardigan.

 October 2014,5,Well worth a visit,"Stayed in October 2014 and were lucky with the weather, saw the sea mist on our first and last day but apart from that it was hot and sunny. The hotel is very very good. The lobby is impressive although most of the reception staff are quite cool but will do what you ask of them. The rooms are great very spacious and clean. Food is excellent for an all inclusive buffet style and the restaurant staff are very attentive and courteous. We tried the a la carte restaurants and found them to be very good also. I did not experience any problems with the bar staff like others have. The pool area is clean and the staff there will help you find a bed no problem. Would I go back - yes without hesitation!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2014,3,Good standard - not 5* though.,"My experience at this hotel was a really good one: there was ample entertainment, views and there were great rooms to stay in. However, there were missing elements to this hotel which caused me to think it better fits a 4* grading. My first issue was the food at the Krystal (I think it was called that anyway) restaurant. The atmosphere and aesthetic impact was great, don't get me wrong. The problem was the food. I was served a rather disgusting starter; a selection of Tomato Gezpacho, a Salmon spoon and something else that was unidentifiable. The main featured Sea Bass; the fish itself was very tasty, but the sides were over seasoned and 'drowned out' the delicious flavour of the fish (excuse the pun). Then I had a chocolate cake thing - revolting is one word to describe it! …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The best hotel i stayed at. The swimming pool area is very big with two pool bars. The staff amazingly pleasant, jumping around, and making every wish come true :) I loved the dinner time as everybody had to dress up, and you really felt as a special guest as the waitresses made a huge effort to serve you well.

 February 2015,5,All we hoped for and more!,"We stayed in the first week of February 2015. We chose Agadir for some relaxation in the winter sun and were fortunate to achieve both. It was also our first ever experience of all inclusive and it was a very positive experience. Weather: Mornings were chilly but the sun was always shining (apart from our last day) and generally by 11am the temperature picked up. That said, many were still putting towels out and laying on the sunbeds by the pool from quite early in the morning. Evenings were breezy so jumpers/cardigans were needed. Area: Friends who had visited Agadir had mentioned they had found locals to be very pushy but I have to say although there were a few people along the promenade selling various items we didn't find them overly pushy or persistent and certainly not…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

All the drink are branded too which is an added bonus. But the best thing about this hotel is the staff, I cannot stress how good they all were, nothing is too much trouble. The only thing I would have liked is WI-FI in the rooms but this is available round the pool and in bar. I would highly recommend a visit.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2015,5,Fantastic!,"we have just returned from a week here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is of an excellent class, the food good and varied, the staff very pleasant and attentive but not in your face. Yes, there were more older people here and many French but what do you expect in Morocco? The one down side for us was the slight lack of atmosphere around the pool area, not that were into loud music or games but the plaza effect made it ever so slightly bland. If you want a really good place to kick back in for a week or two then look no further.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2015,4,Winter sunshine at its' best,"This was our second stay at this hotel and not too much has changed really although on this occasion it was much busier and noisier in the dining room at night. Rooms are large and very comfortable, although a slightly softer bed might have been welcome. Balconies are of a decent size and if you get a south facing room are great for afternoon sunbathing. Food was not as good as previous as they have withdrawn a lot of the individual pots of starters and replaced them with the big bowls of dig in and help yourself offerings. Lunchtime meals were exceedingly repetitive and the coffee from the machine in the dining room is disgusting. Evening meals have plenty on offer to suit most tastes but as with many hotels all the food is dumbed down to suit the masses. Personally I think…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Reception were very welcoming and we were very quickly shown to our room. Very comfortable and of a good size, with nice balcony. Huge buffet restaurant with a vast choice of food and despite its size, we were never in a queue. The lunchtime dining area was equally inviting. A vast pool was surrounded by great loungers and gazebo covered mattresses. Hotel is situated right on the beach with a pleasant traffic free walkway up to the marina. The town of Agadir was a stones throw away. Staff throughout the hotel could not do enough for you. I look forward to returning here next year (or maybe later on this year!).

All the staff around the hotel are always polite and willing to help you. The pool area is ideal for relaxing plenty sunbeds and pool staff will always find you one when pool busy.

 February 2015,5,Fantastic service & facilities,Just got back from this fab hotel after a weeks all inclusive. Very sumptuous and food excellent. For all meals we had options for as much wine or anything else we wanted and most days had a bottle with each meal. All inclusive was not just local drinks - most branded spirits & liquors were available at no extra charge & pool was heated making it bearable on cooler days. Evening entertainment was OK to good with a show every evening either from the in house team or outside acts. The staff were the best I have encountered in any previous hotel and fell over themselves to do everything they could for us without asking for anything in return. For a weeks break out of season this hotel is a winner with us & would be pleased to go back any time,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 February 2015,4,Great resort...shame about ipad getting stolen,"First off agadir is great place to visit lots of nice view and the hotel is amazing from the minute you walk in. Personally I would say the hotel is 5 star with attention to detail in aspects across the resort. The food is pretty good you'll be well feed all day, bar sells brand names Smirnoff and jack Daniels they also do some pretty cool cocktails. Now the only problem on this holiday is that my girlfriend iPad was stolen from the hotel room and personally I think it was the cleaning staff so if you are going to this hotel make sure you put your valuables in the safe when you are leaving the room. Other than that it is a must go place. SUNNY AGADIR 😁",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,The secret is out!,"This is our 3rd visit to the hotel. It was full, mainly French! However some of the British guests are not five star. Skyping loudly by the pool, I don't want to hear some one talking to their dog Peewee. Lots more children this year so noticeable at mealtimes! Staff are still excellent and the food was very varied, especially the Moroccan choices. Rooms are clean and comfortable, but choose level 4 if you don't want to hear the golfers getting up early for breakfast! We go for the sun, but it could be too quiet for young couples.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,Excellent,"Our first time to Morocco and WOW the Riu Tikida Palace could not be faulted - it is excellent; we emailed the hotel prior to arrival and requested a top floor quiet room, the room allocated to us was perfect. At a previous Riu hotel we commented on Trip Advisor about buffet food in the restaurant only being warm, at the Tikida Palace nothing could be further from the truth. Friendly staff in the restaurant, bar, pool and at reception , management were constantly in conversation with guests. If we had to nitpick we would say the dining room tables are a little too close together, however in the specialist restaurants it is the opposite. If you like tipping, tip during your stay and not just at the end, believe me you will reap the benefits. We will return.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,Excellent third visit,"This was our third visit at this time of the year - another first-class holiday. Food, room ambiance and above all, the staff have made this another wonderful holiday. We ate in both of the A la carte restaurants, as well as the main buffet and each time the food was excellent. The hotel is always spotless. If there is an issue - such as the mini bar not being filled (in our case with water) just a call to reception and the matter is dealt with. We cannot fault it.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,Top notch hotel,"this was our third visit to this hotel, we love, cleansliness, attentive staff and food to die for. Our only complaint was our room was an uneven number this means that you don't get any sunshine in January...... But as you don't go on holiday to sit in your room or balcony it is not a problem. Our first year we were rather spoilt with our rooms location. On these AI holidays you do meet some rather rude and ignorant holidaymakers or a certain nationality but I'm afraid to say you get these anywhere!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We asked to move and the lady at reception arranged this for us ASAP which we were very happy with. The pool area and gardens are lovely, well maintained and there was never any issues over sunbeds. The waiters were amazing, bringing us glasses of fizz and drinks to the sun beds etc. The restaurant was great and offered a wide variety of food. there was also an 'italian restaurant' which wasn't much more than a buffet serving pizza, pasta and meats (still nice though!) and a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

What a great result. The Riu Palace. Brilliant space, excellent room and first class staff. Food at each sitting was really fresh and well presented. The key was the staff they made you feel welcome and it was in a good location with opportunity to visit the the town and venture further. Overall a brilliant hotel in a good location.

The a la carte restaurants were very good but they apparently hadnt changed the menus for past three years since hotel opened, this could be addressed although we did book a table in both several times. The hotel was very busy during our two week stay in January and the poolside loungers did get taken well before breakfast time, we did however manage to select chairs everyday in a favourite spot.

Some people may find the hotel too large, but no way does it detract from the quality of the rooms and service. The staff were not only extremely polite and friendly, they were genuinely wanting to please. It very much seemed that they were proud to work in the hotel and that the hotel was proud of them working for it. What a refreshing attitude of people to be found these days.

 January 2015,5,A Real Palace,This is my first stay at a Riu but i will be looking out for the brand when booking future holidays. The first thing that grabbed my attention excluding the vast marble lobby area with comfy sofas to Skype friends and family back home was the level of customer service. The staff are amazing and willing to help in any way they can. The bars (fully stocked with brand names) are overstaffed leading to quick and friendly service. Reception staff have a local knowledge on par with google search. The entertainment: A water aerobics session in the pool ever morning if you are up for it.

As I had not mentioned it was my birthday it was a lovely surprise. So very relaxing and friendly. The staff go out of their way to ensure you have a great holiday. Everything is included and there are no hidden extras. Rooms are all spacious and very clean. Chilly morning and evening in December but warm enough to swim and sunbathe during the day.

This late planned vacation to a short haul venue [booked just the week before], was via Thomson Holidays and I must say they have been great from start to finish. At the price paid, not expecting such an amazing all inclusive week. The whole experience was completely overwhelming and others we met and spoke with were also full of praise regarding the property and staff. Highly commended and recommended. The rooms are large, with character - not just your usual square with bed and a separate section leading to another square for the bathroom.

 January 2015,4,Typical Riu hotel,"We stayed here for a week at the beginning of January. The hotel is very impressive. Check-in was quick considering everyone on the coach were staying here. We had a lovely pool view room which also had a sea view. The split-level room was tastefully decorated and very clean. The bathroom was a good size with shower gel and body lotion provided. I would have expected shampoo and conditioner in a 5? star hotel. The pool area is huge with plenty sun-loungers, although the towel brigade is out early reserving beds. Everywhere in the hotel is spotlessly clean as you would expect from a Riu. Food was very good with lots of choice, but at peak times some dishes were not replenished and other dishes were only warm. We had one meal in the Moroccan restaurant, and while it was nice to be…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,Currently at the hotel,"We arrived last Thursday and we were impressed with the hotel as soon as we got here. We were met with an efficient team to check us in, we had a coach load of Thomson holidayers but were given our room keys in a couple of minutes. Our room 3132 is lovely we think we got an upgrade because we told them of our anniversary. The room is big but if I'm going to be really picky it could do with a visit from maintenance. The plug sockets are a bit loose and you have to be carfeful not to pull them off. There isn't a shaving mirror only the arm which is good for hanging hand towels! The pool area is big with plenty of beds. There is the usual culture of reserving the beds. On our first full day we had 3 reserved beds next to us that were empty until 2pm. We found out it was a German…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,Wow,Amazing hotel. Always loved the rius but this exceeded my expectation massivly. Paid £630 for a week all inc. modern rooms. Amazing views. Wooden sunbeds. Great variety of foods. Very chilled out and relaxed. Highly recommended for the price.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,Excellent Hotel,"Just got back from a two week stay, excellent hotel as expected with the RIU chain, you always know what to expect and get, very good service with clean modern rooms, branded unlimited drinks and excellent range of food including a visit to the Krystal resturant (a must) All the staff are very hard working and polite, we would stay at this hotel again, recommended to all. Tip. Exchange you money in Morocco for the best rate not in the UK , in the UK we got 10.5 d to the £, in Morocco airport we got 13.4 d to the £ Go and enjoy!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,vivvy & Brian,"Absolutely super hotel is definitely a 5* establishment. Super, very professional staff, well organised in every way. Even though it's all inclusive, they manage it so well, drinks served properly so no hint of rowdiism, nor anyone getting drunk. They'd be made to look silly if they did. However I did think that every room should have bath robes, not just suites. We enjoyed 11 days but weather in January not as warm as we had hoped. Also the superb choices of food meant we needed to go home to ordinary food, even though we skipped breakfasts/lunches on several occasions. In all we'd definitely recommend it to anyone.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,Wonderful,"We had high expectations for this hotel having read other reviews and I have to say we were not disappointed. What a great place! The rooms are large airy, very clean and comfortable. Our first room was on the left of the pool which is the shady side. We did find it a little chilly so asked to be moved to the 'sunny' right hand side. The hotel were finally able to move us after 3 nights. We then had a warm, sunny room with a lovely terrace (ground floor). The food was excellent although, as a vegetarian, I found the choice of 'main' dishes a little restrictive. However, there was always plenty of very fresh salad, couscous dishes, pasta and pizzas so I always found something. All staff were friendly and so helpful. The evening waiting staff took it on themselves to teach me a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We did a twin centre holiday with 3 days at Riu Palmeraie in Marrakech The Tikada Palace very decadent and lovely decoration and great artefacts. We ate at the Le Santal restaurant - loads to choose from and catered for every taste including good choice of vegetarian dishes. We were able to book the Marrakech restaurant during our stay and the food and the service was excellent. Managed to book Agadir experience and it's well worth it and lasted about 3 hours Dinner at Krystal restaurant was a disappointment but only in the service we received. We had to wait at least 40 minutes before we were offered a drink and cutlery could have been cleaner. The restaurant was under staffed but was not fully…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

If they court my eye walking towards the bar my Smirnoff and diet coke was ready and waiting by the time I got there. The evening entertainment by the piano got slightly repetitive but I got really involved with my cousin on the dance floor and after midnight went to a couple of clubs and shisha lounges which were absolutely lovely!!

 January 2015,5,Even better than last year,"Stayed from the 8th to 15th Jan 2015. Stayed at this hotel the same time last year. Not a great start to the holiday which was due to two Thomson flights arriving at the same time, very long queue at passport control then a long wait on the transfer coach and on arrival at the Hotel we were the third transfer coach to arrive which meant that the reception staff were flat out, all credit to them for the way they dealt with this. Weather - great on arrival but unfortunately the next 5 days were overcast and quite cool at times, then the sun came out and it felt and looked much better. Last year we had good weather all week. Food - excellent, better than last year, the Moroccan tagines at both lunchtime and evening are varied and very good. The fish which is cooked fresh is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2014,4,Good alternative to the Canary Islands and great Christmas!,Found it to be a very good alternative to the Canary Islands for a bit of winter sun. Temperatures were around 23 C and we found there was always a 4 or 5 hour window for sunbathing and swimming from around 11 am which meant we had time outside of that for other activities without feeling we were missing out on some sun time. Staff were very friendly and efficient and seemed to be genuinely proud of their jobs. We ate in the two speciality restaurants which provided a good change of scenery and it was nice to be served at the table so would recommend people take advantage of this. You have to book but neither restaurant was full when we were there. Had couples massages in the Spa which were very good and professional. My wife’s frozen shoulder was sorted out and the prices were…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2015,4,Very Good Stay,"All inclusive Riu resort, a large hotel. Rooms very comfortable and clean. A couple of minor maintenance matters were dealt with. Large entrance hall which doubles as a lounge, nice but on the dark side, lighting needs revisiting. Staff generally were excellent and it would not be correct to single any individuals out however a 20 Dirhams tip ensures great service. The food was of a very high standard considering the numbers they are catering for, well done for that. Generally an excellent stay and certainly worth a visit.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,First experience of Morrocco,"First time in Morocco, fantastic choice have spent last 3 years staying in Egypt in January,(not anymore). Hotel excellent from the staff to the food. Food always cooked fresh and not left to stew like some hotels, tremendous variety even for a fussy eater like me. weather was not fantastic we had 3 good days but still warm for January unlike UK. We would be coming back next year. We upgraded to pool view room very nicely decorated and bathroom had everything you needed together with a large balcony.

 July 2014,5,Amazing hotel!,"My partner and I stayed here back in July 2014 and our stay was amazing. The hotel pools are lovely and modern, the lobby is simply stunning with beautiful decor. The food at the hotel was delicious and there was sooooo much choice, all cooked fresh, couldn't fault it! Only one downside was at the pool bar, the soft drink taps were covered in wasps that were obviously attracted to the sweetness which was a bit off putting when you watched them fly up the taps just before your drink was poured! So some fly/wasp repellant device would be useful here. Our room was beautiful and huge! We had a separate seating area as well as built in wardrobes and a lovely big balcony. We didn't venture too far out of the hotel really but walked along the promenade and onto the beach a few…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2014,4,Needs to get back to a 5*,"This was our forth visit to the Palace and we love the hotel and staff but it needs to improve and get back to being a 5* hotel again. The hotel staff are brilliant but two things need to be sorted out very quickly first the restaurants, the food is lukewarm and the chefs cannot replenish the serving trays fast enough meaning the meats and fish are undercooked trying to keep up with the demand, at about 2.00pm lunchtime and 8.00pm in the evening it’s a complete total disaster. Evening drinks in the foyer and entertainment bars keep running out of some branded drinks around 10.30pm to 11.00pm so you can only drink the local brands, No 5* hotel should ever run out. This has happened on all four of our visits. I have got that off my chest so I will carry on, last year a lot of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2015,5,"It's great, relaxing and in a nice position. Lovely spot if you like to surf too.","We stayed here at New Year, 2014-5. I can't fault the hotel - this was our first time staying in a hotel like this, so we felt very well looked after. The facilities are great, and the food was of an exceptional quality - all cooked to order, very little waste and all fresh and delicious with a huge range of new tastes. The Moroccan food was exceptional, we had an incredible fish tajine one night, and fresh octopus another. The service was amazing. We are both surfers and have a small toddler, and we found that the hotel was right on the beach (clean, clear water) where, most days, there was a small but perfectly formed wave rolling in.

(Apart from the very early risers with their towels- the hotel do not remove them) Food was great, even a fussy eater could find a lot to like, we tried all the restaurants and didn't regret it. I also had a massage with argan oil in the hotel spa. All very lovely. We also took the shuttle bus to the local golf course and had an awesome day.

 November 2014,5,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed at this hotel from 20th to the 27th November 2014. I always review the hotels I stay at as I feel that gaining other travellers' opinions is a very important step when booking a holiday. This is one of many Riu Hotels that we have stayed at and I can honestly say it was one of the best. The important things for me when choosing a hotel are the attitude of the staff, location, cleanliness, good food and drinks, and the type of guests that stay at the hotel. When we arrived we were immediately impressed with the magnificence of the main reception area. The reception desk itself was quite small but well staffed. We had chosen to take a taxi from the airport so we managed to get our rooms sorted very quickly without having to wait for an influx of new guests. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The staff are extremely pleasant & helpful & not chasing tips (which are gratefully received though). The food is really good with so much choice at each meal to be almost over-facing but there is everything that you could want.

It has a heated section in the main pool which was like walking into a bath, so much warmer than the one in Marrakech. The children spent all day in and out of the pool. Agadir is more laid back than Marrakech with a long promenade, we hired cycles and did the whole length to the modern marina. The rooms are lovely, very spacious with side sea views.

However, it must be said that the hotel was overcrowded. One of the Tikida hotels on the strip was being renovated and that may have had some bearing, but both the restaurant and the pool area were uncomfortably busy for much of the time.

There were two outdoor pools in the hotel one heated and one ice cold also 1 indoor pool. Clean gym with some good weights, running machines ect. 3 Big restaurants 2 of which you needed to book.

Changes made nightly &tastes fantastic. Not sure about the a la carte resteraunt, visited one and found the food to be a let down, and also not being able to order more drinks other than the wine they offered was an inconvenience, as me and my partner are not wine drinkers.

The dinning room was a little hectic at times, and the two other restaurants we thought a little below par.

Worse still after 8;30am the maids are in the rooms dragging furniture again on tiled floors making the most horrendous noise....?? so no lie in there!!

 December 2014,4,Brilliant relaxing holiday!,"We were met on arrival with a cocktail and check in was very smooth, bags were at the room by the time we had got a drink! I'd recommend the mojitos. The food is good but not always clearly labeled, if you are a sensitive coeliac sufferer I would contact the hotel in advance and my partner is vegetarian so we had to ask a few times if thing were suitable. The staff are really helpful and friendly and the spa treatments are amazing. The pool was amazing and only a few minutes from the beach. The rooms were spotless and clean towels every day. As we were there in December there wasn't much going on around and about but that wasn't what we were there for.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2014,3,"Hotel 5 star, service 3","Mixed reviews for this hotel. First the positive points. It looks like a 5 star hotel and is kept very clean. Pool area is lovely and the pool guys will move beds, bring you towels or anything you want. The rooms are very nice, cleaned everyday and mini bar restocked everyday. The main restaurant is nice and food is good but gets a bit boring after a few days as menu is repetitive. Breakfast is mainly cold and you have to pester to get coffee and service as the waiters stand folding napkins all morning. The two restaurants you have to book are worth trying. The food was lovely but service again very poor. Drinks are really good. All named spirits and cava part of inclusive. location not bad. Near to shops and a few bars and restaurants.

First impressions of the hotel were wow however the room we were allocated at the hotel was not good, it had a balcony overlooking the staff entree nice an the bins. We asked reception if this could be changed and were told no problem but it would be the next day. Later that evening the manager overheard my daughter complaining to the thomson rep about the room and that we were there for my birthday, we got an amazing room (an upgrade) and a really sweet little present for my birthday. All the staff were super efficient, friendly and attentive, I really can't understand what some people complain about.

 December 2014,5,"Not child friendly per se, Brilliant.","We spent last week at this hotel and it exceeded all of our expectations. Before we went I perused a review from a woman on here complaining about her children being given dirty looks. Let's get something straight, the Thompson catalogue is full of Child Friendly Hotels that have the facilities and staff to deal with children and give them a good holiday. This is not one of them. This hotel accepts children but it mainly aims at couples of all ages and single adults. We found that children had been brought here and using one of the excellent 'Special' restaurants on two nights we were entertained by young children shouting and bashing things around in what where 'romantic' places full of couples. Naturally there were some older children who were all well behaved as they had…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2014,5,Superb Hotel,Just come back from a week in this hotel. It can't be faulted I think Agadir is well kept secret. The staff can't do enough for you. We were at the Tikida Beach last year where you had to tip to get anything. Here you can tip for excellent service. It is kept beautifully clean the pool is wonderful all be it a bit cold but most pools are this time of year. Some of the shows are a bit twee but they try hard. There's a lovely walk to the Marina with a few coffee shops on the quay. Hawkers approach you but a polite no thank you and they leave you alone. Every day about 4 o'clock the locals promenade with their children and the youngsters play football on the beach its a lovely experience. A visit to the Souk is a must just to see all the local veg and fruit on show. The Haman…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2014,5,Great hotel,Just returned from a week in this superb hotel. We were lucky with the weather because we had a week of sun but the week before had lots of rain. Could not fault the hotel it really is a 5 star in every way. The rooms are roomy and spotlessly clean. All the staff are lovely and friendly. Hubby was happy with his jack Daniels and not the usual local spirits. Will certainly return. Only little niggle was games room only had a table tennis table working and other equipment broken as was 2 of the 3 bikes in the gym. No problem for us but the week before in the rain it could have been a problem. But these are tiny problems that can be easily fixed. On the whole this hotel is a must for anyone who just wants a wonderful week of relaxing sun and good food.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2014,4,Winter Sun Getaway.,Just returned after a week at the Palace. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Very good food and plenty of choice. The patisserie selection was especially heavenly! Comfortable rooms and evening entertainment ranged from watchable to very good. The weather in early December was hot by day but chilly in the evening. Excellent pool weather but not beach weather. Able to walk outside the hotel without being pestered. We went to Touradant with Thomsons and really enjoyed seeing 'Moroccan life'. Only negative was the coffee and cream theme which dominates the hotel decor.... after a few days we found it depressing!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 November 2014,5,This hotel is everything it says it is and more,"Despite horrendously adverse weather conditions during the last week of November the hotel staff did everything within their power to ensure that our holiday was not a total wash-out. A daily army of people dried off the flooded walkways, constructed an avenue of sun umbrellas through the gardens to the lunch restaurant and generally smiled their way through the throng of discontented guests. Particular mention must be made of Hamada, who went the extra mile to ensure that his exercise classes provided a highlight in every day - his teaching skills and attention to detail are exemplary. The massage and treatment facility on the ground floor is also excellent and well worth the cost - would definitely recommend this rather than any facility outside the hotel.The food in the main…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Huge long corridors to your room, room was amazing. Comfy bed, lounge area, huge bathroom with 2 sinks, great shower. The pool area was fantastic though the water was freezing so no visit to the pool bar. Good bar service, only thing lacking was no staff walking around sun beds to take drink orders. Close to the beach. Good selection of food in restaurants, loved the tagines. Entertainment in evening generally was poor and was over far too early.

Porters appear from nowhere eager to assist in taking your bags the 10 yard to the bus, if you hand over your bags remember to hand over a tip! A short drive to the hotel (30 mins) and when you walk into the lobby a cool drink awaits! The rooms are large and airy with an equally large balcony, and a great bathroom.

 November 2014,5,Wet winter visit,"Just returned from this hotel. As previously stated the weather was a let down. We have been to Agadir before at this time of the year and the weather was fine though cold at night. The hotel itself is very good,the rooms spacious and clean. The food was lovely and plentiful and the alcohol excellent, branded spirits if requested. We had no problems with service at any time,the staff were always helpful and friendly even though they were rushed off their feet at times due to the weather stopping people getting out and about.

Unfortunately the weather let us down this time, but the rooms are so nice we just chilled out in the room or stayed in the lobby bar. When the rain did stop for a short time we walked down to the beach to see the terrible mess the storms had brought in, but they started clearing it straightaway. The staff worked really hard to clear up the water everywhere. Not much to do if it rains. Definitely will go back again.

There is a childrens club with a shallow pool located at the other end of the hotel which my son was not old enough to join but this is the first hotel I have been to that does not have a children's pool or section in the main pool??

Be warned once through if you allow the local men to take your suitcases to your coach or car they will want paying which was a lot of unwanted hassle. Our suitcases were literally whisked out of our hands without being asked whether we wanted assistance or not. Once through it was about a 45 minute drive to the hotel and we were greeted warmly by the reception staff.

We loved the spaciousness of the interior and the beautifully laid out grounds which were immaculate. The two main restaurants (evening and lunch) in which the variety of food and service was excellent. The range of drinks available from the five bars, and service could not have been better.

In the main restaurant the food was good but lacked variety into our second week. There were some tables for two available but otherwise tables were set in blocks of six.

Once we attended the Spa it was a very nice experience that put me into a deep sleep. The animation team were very nice and I even completed my ice bucket challenge there. The food in the main restaurant was not great the choice was also fairly limited.

In fact the customer interaction has improved and the staff come across as helpful friendly and caring, and no this is not as result of giving large tips. All the main dining areas are buffet style but the variety and quality of food on offer makes it hard to decide what not to choose as we were faced with at least three choices at every meal.

The bedrooms are spacious - though the beds are slightly on the firm side! The food was definitely 5* - some of the best food we have experienced. The main buffet restaurant was very nice with a lovely atmosphere. The food here was excellent, there was always something to tempt you however fussy you are. Likewise the A La Carte restaurants were of a very good standard, our favorite being the Italian where you can dine outside. This is a buffet restaurant but still very good. The drinks were all branded spirits and there was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,The best hotel I have ever stayed in,No problems whatsoever with hotel. Amazing food amazing service. 2 minute walk to the beach plenty of actives and things to do within the hotel.

 November 2014,5,Amazing Relaxing Holiday,"We have just returned from 1 week at the Riu Palace & had a fantastic holiday. I truly struggle to see what some people complain about & having visited some beautiful hotels around the world, this hotel delivered as promised, was value for money and I would highly recommend. Pre- arrival: I became a RIU member online plus separately emailed the hotel 2 weeks before 2 request a high, South facing sunny room near reception (on top of paying for a pool view) with Thompson. We were given a perfect room on the 4th floor as requested! Food: Krystal restaurant: lovely decor & an enjoyable 3 course meal. There was not a problem making a reservation & the restaurant was only half full. That said it clashed with the 'Chinese' themed night in the main restaurant (Friday). We did…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,Long Trousers Essential,"Travelling with family and friends means that there is someone who find something wrong with nearly everything. However in this hotel there was never agreement about what was wrong but there was a lot of agreement about what was right, large rooms , excellent food, good quick friendly service and a brilliant location by the beach. What a beach it is miles of sand and excellent waves. The main restuarant offered a very varied menu every night (if you like fish you will be in heaven) always a choices of meats, poultry, fish and cheeses (this was the case for breakfast dinner and evening meal and an endless supply of fresh salad and breads. Gentlemen do have to wear long trousers for dinner in the evening. The specialist restaurants provided high quality food (though the A La Carte…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I am well travelled and have stayed in some amazing hotels around the world - however this one so far has topped my list of best hotels! First of all i think the prices were amazing for what you get! i dont understand how they made any money out of us! First impressions: The reception area is a giant vast room which is like a ballroom! Absolutely stunning! The garden areas are kept pristine and the grounds are beautiful - even after 11 days here i was still noticing new things about the hotel i loved! There are multiple bars and restaurants around the hotel all with beautiful decor & gorgeous places to sit drink and eat. There is a shop in reception which sells cute presents and practical things incase you've forgotten anything. The…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,"Lovely hotel, lovely people and lovely place","We found the whole experience wonderful, we have never been to morocco and we were so pleasantly surprised how much better it was than egypt. The hotel and the beach were clean and very well maintained and lots of sunbeds on the beach. We arranged our stay directly so we didnt have any problems with agencies like thomsons as we didnt use them. Quite a few people did though so I would say stay away from thomsons if you can. We ate many times at the krystal because by the evening I like my food brought to me, sometimes the service was a bit slow or lacking but the food was always okay. The main restaurant was always busy but always lots of food and it was nice to be greeted as you went in and shown a table and it was nice that there was a clothing policy as it made a very grown…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,Great hotel,"My family and I went to Morocco for the first time last summer and we stayed in this luxury hotel for 12 days. It is situated just next to the beautiful beach of Agadir (the only thing between the two is the boardwalk). Our room was excellent: it was very big, it had comfortable beds, a terrace with a view on the swimming pool, a great bathroom and a television with several international channels. Overall, the service was very good, we did even sympathise with some members of the staff. However, some (but very few) of the waiters were clearly expecting a tip and as long as they hadn't had it, they served us quite poorly (but this was really the exception). A lot of activities were organized every day, such as beach-volley, aquagym (very popular), waterpolo, darts, or even arabic…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,EIGHTH FANTASTIC HOLIDAY AT RIU PALACE TIKIDA AGADIR,This was our eighth holiday and went for my wife's birthday. Any review that says it does not cater for the English is rubbish. We have always been treated like all holiday makers with a professional approach by all the staff. We have had the same maid cleaning our room on about five of our visits and she was so good in the way she kept our room clean and tidy. Nothing is to much trouble for them. We ate in the main restaurant most of the time as the food is very varied and first class in taste and presentation. We used both the Moroccan and the Krystal (2) and received excellent service on all our visits. All the waiting staff in the speciality and main restaurants are very friendly and will do anything to make sure you have an enjoyable experience. The lunch time…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,4,Great Week,"Just returned from a week at this great hotel. The weather was fabulous, the hotel a great find. The hotel was spotless, and rooms an excellent size. The food above average but can understand if people get a bit fed up with it if staying for longer than a week. All drinks apart from the cocktails very good, but at times the bar service and service in the lobby and breakfast service left a bit to be desired. The young entertainment staff are a great asset to the hotel with their enthuisum and sense of fun. If you wish to use the gym the equipment is limited and needs updating, and I felt the indoor pool was a bit on the dark side to feel entirely safe in there. Wandered along the promenade a couple of times and although the sellers do approach they don't hassel you when you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,what a great hotel,"this was our first trip to morocco so we looked long and hard at the various ratings given by people on tripadviser and chose this hotel,what a great decision.The staff and everyone at the hotel were super friendly and could not do enough for you.....Even the manager and his team were visible around the resort and would stop and talk to you and were always approachable...the drinks were all branded especially the spirits,jack daniels etc which made a nice change and the measures were always generous...the food was very very good with something for everyone.....we only had a week but would have no hesitation in going back....",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,Would definitely recommend this wonderful Hotel!,"We spent one week here this month. The first thing that struck us was how clean everything is. Check in was simple, we arrived late so went straight to our room rather than eating. The room was a Twin Room overlooking the Gardens, it was very comfortable and clean and upon request they turned our 2 beds into 1 enormous one with no trouble at all. FOOD... We didn't use the speciality restaurants so on that I cannot comment. The normal restaurants however were very good. There was always a good choice at Breakfast and the restaurant down by the Pool for lunch was excellent. Always a lot of choice, something for everyone. We did find there were never any snacks at the snack bar so if you want something ask at the bar. POOL.... Absolutely freezing! Lol. The swim up bar always…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,Great staff,"there is nothing you can possibly fault with this hotel. The rooms and standard of food is very good and caters for all tastes. The staff are without question, totally friendly and attentive, making the holiday perfect in every way. The ""all-inclusive"" certainly is. Bars are open 24 hours serve known brands not watered down local drinks. The hotel is situated directly on the beach, separated by the narrow prom. The beach is very clean although the currents this week have been a bit strong. Gentle breakers and good for surfers no doubt. A great family holiday overall and well worth coming. Tours are interesting but somewhat sales orientated of course.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,Very Nice Hotel,"Late review Stayed 20th August to 28th August 2014 This was our first visit to Morocco and the RIU Tikida Palace is set right on the beach just across the Promenade. We e-mailed in advance asking for a room upgrade due to it being my birthday and was very pleased to have a beach front suit it was lovely very spacious comfortable and kept spotlessly clean by the housekeepers more than we could have expected. We found all the staff very friendly from reception, the restaurant, bar staff & housekeeping. There are two restaurants plus the buffet the food was varied and very nice the wine and beer is very good with a range of cocktails on offer.

 September 2014,4,A touch of Paradise,"Firstly, can I just say before I start this review, that the person that has written the review titled 'Not 5 star! Please read...' Is talking utter rubbish. I agree everyone has their own opinions of a hotel and what they put may actually be how they felt, but you can't mess with the facts and some of what has been stated isn't factual. We must have holidayed at the same time as I too was there from 4th-18th September and was also there when ONE OF THE POOLS was emptied for a few days. To say this left you completely without a pool for a day though is COMPLETELY UNTRUE. Actually what did occur (and this is the truth) was that one of the pools was emptied, and it was for a 3 days at most before they started to fill it again, but this was because someone had let their child do…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,4,5 star hotel... Some downfalls,"Upon arrival it was late after a delayed flight so just wanted to get checked in. First day we were woken by cleaners who drag the beds and furniture around from silly o'clock instead of picking it up, this is very loud and woke us every day. Hotel is very clean though. First night of dinner (all inclusive holiday) and we were greeted by the most unfriendly restaurant manager I have ever met, telling my partner he could not eat in the resturant unless he had long trousers on (bearing in mind he was the smartest dressed person there and his shorts were long smart shorts) because he had his ankles out, so we went to reception to ask about this and the receptionist was the most rude lady I have ever met in my life, shouting at us and telling us she can get the rules up on get…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,5,Beautiful Hotel and great value,Three days ago my husband and I returned from a 2 weeks stay at Riu Palace Tikida. It has been a fantastic holiday in a beautiful and spacious hotel. We have stayed in very good hotels in a number of countries and I would say this one is exceptional in the food and drinks all inclusive package. The drinks are branded with branded mixes. I cannot understand the reviewer who stayed at the same time as us saying there was no waiter service from the sun loungers as we were asked on numerous occasions but declined as we prefered to get up and have a walk to one of the poolside bars ourselves. The waiters do ask who is next but this I thought was perfectly ok as we never had to wait for more than a couple of mins. Food was lovely we also had breakfast at around 7 30 and never had…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

After looking at the various comments on this site we plumped for the Palace ( we have used Riu a number of times previously). 1. Reception personnel we very pleasant and accommodating, although we had to ask twice for a shower gel refill. However we had a problem with our safe and this was sorted very promptly. 2. Our room was spacious with a settee and chairs and good sized balcony (good room 3044), nicely decorated, great black out curtains.all the normal facilities and was kept extremely clean and tidy.

 September 2014,3,Not too bad but,"We spent a week from 15th Sept . We arrived at 10pm and took 45 minutes to check in, no problem as they gave us complimentary cocktails . The room we had was a double on the 1st floor. It smelt of damp and the shower water would not drain from the bath . This they fixed in 2 days . The room was handy for the entrance to the pool and we could use the garden doors to nip in and out. The beds were comfortable but it was 2 single beds. The 3 restaurants were good. Best for location was the Italian as this was overlooking the beach and was nice to eat with the sun set. The main restaurant was good for breakfast . We had dinner there after our 1st full day and was throwing up that night, but took it easier the next day and recovered. The morrocan restaurant was nice although only…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is very clean and the gardens are well kept. The hotel staff couldn`t do enough they made our stay very enjoyable. The food was good and had plenty of choice morning, lunch and evening dinner. We had no problem getting sunbeds around the pool but it did get busy by 10.00 o`clock. our room was large and very clean but the only problem there was no draws in the room so we had to keep some clothes in our suitcase.

We were surprised to be upgraded to a garden room as we were told the hotel was at full capacity, when we arrived at our room we were hugely disappointed! The décor and space was lovely but the room was very damp! Plaster was cracked and powdery, big water stains were on the ceiling, the bed sheets were damp and the smell of damp was unbearable!

 September 2014,3,Third time Visit and not Good for 5*,"We have been back to this hotel now three times the last was 18 September to 03 October 2014 and the first was fraught with service issues. It improved thanks to management on the second visit last year (2013) However, on our return this year there where still issues with some of the rooms according to people we spoke to our only gripe with the room was that it always smelled damp, and our cloths felt damp when we got them out in the evening to go to dinner. Apart from that the room was fine. The hotel is only approximately 3 year old but looking around the pool area there was signs of tiles needing repair it looked tired, on one occasion it required a barrier to stop people from walking in a small area as the tiles had cracked and lifted. When mentioned to Management they…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Hotel management were always on hand to chat to and always kept there eye on everything. Have just booked again for March 2015 and we are really looking forward to another visit. Don't mind some of the comments if you are polite to staff they will return the complement, All staff work extremely hard for little reward so don't be shy show them your appriciation and give them a couple of quid.

There is plenty of seating around the hotel RECEPTION The first impression of the reception staff was fine however after requesting another room as ours smelt of sewage they were very reluctant to help and quite rude. Eventually we were able to change rooms the following morning. Our other experiences with the reception staff were equally unhelpful, they were unable to answer simples questions are queries about the hotel and we were told to ask someone else.

 July 2014,5,Honeymoon - Great Hotel,"Having spent two weeks here for our honeymoon in June, my wife and I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a week - 10days just to chill in the Sun you can't go far wrong. The hotel: It is superb from the lobby when you walk in to the pool areas. It truly is All Inclusive too, you pay for nothing, Wine, Cava, branded spirits (even bombay sapphire Gin is included!) and the beer is nice too. The food choice is excellent in the main buffet and at lunch. We really enjoyed being able to miss the main morning breakfast rush and go for a later breakfast in the snack bar which served pretty much the same as what was in the main buffet restaurant. The only downside on the food front was the speciality restaurants: the Moroccan restaurant was an experience, the Italian was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,4,Honeymoon,"We stayed at The Rui Tikida Palace for our honeymoon in September this year. The weather was lovely very very hot some days but the pool more then made up for this as me and my hubby often went in for a cool off. Its was a lovely place to chill out for a week, i dont think we could of done two weeks though. The Good Points The hotel rooms and grounds are lovely and are well kept, the detail they have gone to to build and decorate this hotel is 5 star. There is always maids cleaning or gardeners keeping the grounds well kept. We had no problem getting sunbeds everyday and we didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn to get them, some days we even got the lovely gazebo to chill in.

 October 2014,4,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed for a week at the beginning of October. I know it's nothing to do with the hotel but be aware that this late in the year there can be a sea mist during the mornings (it usually clears by 1 in the afternoon.) Hotel was impressive on first impressions, very large lobby with a bar towards the back and lots of comfy seating. Check in was quick and simple, we were a bit early so just went to get a drink while we waited for our room to be ready. Room was huge and well decorated. Mini bar stocked with water, beers and soft drinks. Outside pool was lovely, with lots of sun beds but you got the usual idiots that put their towels/books and sun cream on them at stupid o clock so in a week we only managed to get sunbeds once, and we didn't get there late, usually not after 10.30.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,Lovely week stay,"I stayed at this hotel for a week at the beginning of September after changing hotels due to a few problems. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there and would recommend it to others. For me the things that made my stay more enjoyable are: 1: the animation team; they were hilarious. They really did try the best they could do entertain people. There were several exercise classes/ pool activities that the young staff tried to get everyone involved in. My personal favorite was Aqua gym! A show was put on every night where you could tell they had put a lot of effort into, obviously not the best in the world but still made us laugh after a few drinks. 2: the food was really good lots of choice. Yes it may get a little repetitive after a week but there wS plenty of options. The pistachio…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,Honeymoon,"We stayed at the Riu tikida palace for our honeymoon. We were welcomed to our room with roses, fruit and homemade biscuits/sweets. The only thing better would of been a pool or sea view as out room overlooked the carpark. We loved the pool area but agree with other review regarding the amazing of sunbeds & parasols, when the hotel is busy by 9:30 most our reserved but not always occupied till much later in the day, pretty annoying. The buffet restaurants are good with plenty of choice, we preferred to sit in the outside eating areas as much quieter and much more pleasant dining experience. We visited the fusion and the morocan restaurant, I personally preferred the morocan but both we're good. We did the agadir experience and fantasia excursion, both were ok but not…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2014,4,Really Great Holiday,"Just back from a week at this hotel, travelling with Thomson. Agadir itself was disappointing, mainly as it seemed to us, to be a giant unfinished building site, but that said we really enjoyed our break and this was all thanks to the hotel. The hotel was in a great location, in the middle of the long seafront promenade, felt very safe walking around outside the hotel, yes there were vendors who tried to sell their wares, but none were persistent and moved away as soon as we indicated 'non merci'. The beach was fine, very soft sand and very wide, easy to walk in the shallows, which we did most days. There were Riu staff cleaning each day on the promenade and the reserved beach area.

 September 2014,4,"Lovely hotel with lots of positives, but not what I consider 5 Star","We arrived at the hotel about midnight and check in was relatively quick and painless! There were a lot of us arriving at the same time though, so others will have had to wait a bit longer. The entrance / reception is huge and impressive, with loads of comfy chairs and tables to relax, have a drink, and listen to the lounge singer (he's on every night and is OK, but prob wouldnt make it through the first round of the X Factor)! Our room, which was very spacious, modern, and clean, was on the ground floor (with a table and 2 chairs outside). I mention the location of our room because on arrival, there was a bad smell in the room (which I think was coming from outside).

 September 2014,3,The 'clique culture',"This was our second trip to this hotel, having visited when it first opened two years ago. We had an enjoyable two weeks in the sunshine and returned home relaxed, which was the main intention but although I agree that the hotel itself is beautiful, some of the staff have learned nothing in the two years they have been there. In particular, the evening bar staff (who also double as pool bar staff in the day) most definitely have their favourites and if you don't tip regularly, you might as well resign yourself to having a long wait to be served. One of the main culprits (small with glasses) is rudeness personified and will mumble to his colleagues when you approach - making it plain you are to be ignored at all costs. We believe in tipping to reward good service, not to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,The perfect honeymoon,"Brilliant hotel, great variety of food to an excellent standard. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Sometimes clear up a little too quick so leave someone at your table. Entertainers are great, not fantastic in the evening but didn't go there for the entertainment. The outside entertainment was excellent. The weather was changeable. The fog that came in off the sea cooled things down but you still could get a tan and was still warm enough to sit round the pool. If you want a sun bed you will have to get up early and put your towels down before breakfast. The bed was hard but so comfortable and the curtains made it so dark that we didn't want to get up.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,4,Honest review of a great hotel!,"Stayed here for two weeks in September. On arrival we were presented with a cocktail, check in was quick and easy, we were greeted by the assistant manager who directed us to our room. One slight downside was our luggage took quite a while to arrive to our room. We were on the top floor though so I assume we were one of the last to receive ours but after a long day and with it being late at night, waiting over an hour seemed a very long time. Our room was fantastic, split level with plenty of room and nice decor. The bathroom is massive with his and her sinks, a bath with 2 shower heads and a toilet. Hair dryer included. Our mini bar was stocked regularly, leaving a tip ensured we had more than we started with! Another downside was the two single beds rather than a double but…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The food was plentiful, with an excellent choice and always freshly cooked. The staff were just brilliant, always attentive, smiling and helpful. Made you feel that you were the only guests staying. Poolside was equally well appointed with a plentiful supply of sunbeds and again staff to bring you drinks whenever required. Cannot recommend highly enough. 🌞⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🌞",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We were both speechless when we walked in (I'm not normally lost for words!). The room was perfect so a good start to the holiday. We didnt arrive at the hotel until late in the evening and were looking forward to having a good sleep before exploring the next day, but it took the bell boy over 1 1/2 hours to bring the bags to our room, we didn't let it dampen our spirits though.

We encounter many issues while at the hotel and the hotel has rules which they don't follow up on Signs by the pool no inflatables allowed in the pool but they sell them in the hotel shop! Can't reserve beds by the pool but the pool cleaners help you with cushions at 6am to reserve beds so if you have not put a towel out by 7am you might struggle to get a good place Hotel reception not helpful got told the 2rooms we booked were on separate floors but the rooms were 4 days apart Wanted to play snooker and asked reception where the balls were nobody knew so…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

On day 5 we saw that the pool was being emptied in the evening. We were told that a child had excreted in the pool and that it was being emptied, cleaned and refilled overnight. It was two and a half days later before the pool was open again. The management had decided that as the pool was to be emptied they would take the opportunity to rip up and re-do the tiling around the edges before the winter. Every 2nd day they would run out of draft beer. It appeared that they only ordered beer when it ran out and then only enough for one day ? To be fair they did offer cans of beer but this was super strength and not suitable for thirst quenching (this probably accounted…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2014,4,We will be back,"Just returned from a one week all inc break. Great hotel, location,resort. Staff very attentive and friendly. Food was of a good standard and plenty of it. We couldn't fault anything but we did hear some people with the standard uk grumbles ! Well they wouldn't be British without something to grumble about. Please just take the chance and visit this very relaxing, clean, we'll run hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,4,Nice Time,"We arrived home last week. This is a nice hotel and very friendly. Weather was hit and miss but reading from previous reviews this is the norm. I should have done my research. We saw no preference at all from different nationalities and the service we had was superb, you don't need to be fluent in French. I agree the a la carte restaurants lacked atmosphere and the food was not up to scratch but all in all not bad. There was never any issue with sunbeds and we are not early birds. I agree some are taken very early but I don't see the reason why. The animation team are a great bunch of kids and are very at tentative always with a smile and always time to say hello. Walking outside to the Marina or Souk is no problem at all. You do get asked to buy goods but a simple no thank…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,The best Hotel in Agadir,"We Stayed in the sister hotel Tikida Doon last year and had a walk round the Palace we liked it so much we decided to book it this year, Hotel Reception Staff are some of the best we have meet they could not do enough for you and the very large seating area has so mean seat you can always find some where to sit , the waiters will circulate round the lobby area asking if you would like a drink from the bare they will also bring you dishes of nibbles The nightly entertainment in the lobby bar is exultant , most nights there is a professional entertainer \who will go into the main theatre area later in the evening and start all over again on the big stage. There are 3 theme restaurants as well as the main buffy restaurant the food in all of them is very very good , Lunch time…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,Fantastic Holiday!!!,"From the moment we sat on the plane to when we returned to Gatwick bronzed and relaxed, the experience was superb! Thomson as an airline are very well organised and offer a reputable service. But the most impressive part of the holiday was the hotel. A beautiful entrance to a grand reception area, greeted by some very attentive staff. The enthusiasm of the staff never wanes from the moment you arrive to the moment you depart. Likes: Service, hotel room (finish and quality 5*), F&B is exceptional, the main restaurant is what you should expect for a mass catering venue but the opportunity to dine in the a la carte restaurants adds to the value for money with the Palace. The pool area is very well maintained and if you fancy a day on the sandy beach you can! All in all and very…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,4,Not as good as our last visit,"We went back to this hotel after an excellent holiday last year, but were not as pleased with the service this time. Don't get me wrong the Hotel is an excellent but the standard is not upto the five star that you would expect from the Riu group. We visited the Morrocan a la carte and the beef tagine was horrible ,the meat was very fatty and not a patch on the same dish as the previous year ,at the welcome meeting the assistant manager Mr Rafael said that if you have any complaints to go and see him about them.I went to him after the meal and told him about the food we had been served and he said he would go straight to the kitchen about our complaint. we heard nothing else from him and some other customers that went to the Morrocan two nights later told us the Tagine was fatty…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,Great Place for a Chill Out,"Had a week at the hotel from 11th September, It's a very impressive building and worth the 5 star rating. We arrived early hours of the morning and was nice that they had put a cold buffet on in the main dining room whilst our bags were taken to the room. The room was very spacious and spotless, bathroom was lovely and shower was fantastic. We spent everyday on the beach as the pool area gets a little crowded. The food was absolutely amazing, too many choices sometimes so you had to keep going back to try more, Oh well, you are on holiday!!! The only little thing we were not happy with were some of the bar staff at the pool bar and lobby bar, if you weren't in their little click, throwing tips at them all day they would serve other people and ignore you, but overall had a lovely…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,One of the best Riu hotels,"Here at the moment fabulous hotel wonderful private beach, the staff are great as well as very friendly. This is one of the best Riu hotels we have stayed in the rooms are all suites with split level lounge areas very clean. There is such a good selection of food in the main restaurant you don't need the al a carte ones, these are not very good anyway the food in the Fusion was very salty. One critism is that the main restaurant does not have enough al fresco tables or enough tables for two with save between them otherwise couldn't fault it.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,4,A lovely honeymoon,We stayed here for 10 nights from the 8th of September. We booked our stay through Thompson (The Thompson reps in the hotel were terrible). We arrived at the hotel to a cocktail and a quick and easy check-in. Our room was very clean and tidy and the fruit and biscuit selection were nice to arrive too. We had a few problems with our safe and one of the wardrobe doors have come off its rail which was annoying but we just got on with it. The food was very varied and as someone who can be picky I always had food to eat. We did find that the food could be oily which we think which was why we had upset tummies on a few occasions. I would highly recommend the Krystal restaurant which we went to twice. The food and service were brilliant. We couldn't fault the staff in the restaurants.…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,"lovely hotel, great holiday.","we have just returned from this beautiful hotel and feel it is worth its 5 star status. i have stayed in a few rui's and this was definately the best. the bedroom was amazing, large, comfortable and very clean actually the whole site was very clean staff were constantly cleaning! The food was lovely, always plenty no matter what time you went, yes it seems repetative but that is the same in most alinclusive hotels, but if you try something different each night you have to be quite fussy to not find anything you like. The staff were always friendly, polite and helpful, ok so we did wait a couple of minutes at the bar occasionally but as we were on holiday i wasnt in any rush! We definately would come back here.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The bedrooms are huge with step down lounge area onto balcony , double louvre doors into big bathroom with his and her sinks, bath with shower and doors into loo and bidet. The buffet food was lovely with plenty of fish on the menu ( which was great for me as a non meat eater) and so much choice for all tastes. Champagne available for breakfast and throughout the day in all the bars along with proper branded drinks like Jack Daniels, Smirnoff vodka etc - unlike most other all inclusives we have been on where we take our own drink to have whilst getting ready in the evening because the drinks are poor- even had a Baileys one evening as a night cap.

 September 2014,5,"Beautiful, immaculate hotel, brilliant staff","A warning to anyone who has yet to read a review of mine. They're long! This one will be no different, especially as I want to try and do the place and its people justice. I'll start with the hotel itself and echo what many have already said on here. The hotel is beautiful. A real jewel. Impeccably tended to each day and with perfectly presented staff that are always willing to help. Its in a great location as far as Agadir beach is concerned and not far at all from Agadir souk for when you visit there (which you must). The room itself was also superb, a bed that you could roll over 3 times in and still not fall out of. A bathroom cast in marble with huge mirrors and saloon style vented doors. The staff are very friendly indeed and here is the 'piece de resistance' - if you've…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2014,3,Not a 5 star!,"Just got back last night from this hotel after spending a week with my partner was super excited after experiencing 5 star service before I couldn't wait to show my partner what it was all about, and after paying a sufficient amount I really did expect a lot more.... Our room was spacious and clean, beds were comfy, staff were lovely but this is not a 5 star if your expecting to be Waited on and that 'luxury feeling' this is not your place! The hotel itself is beautiful but the staff let it down you have to Que at the bars for drinks it is very slow and the cocktails you order are different every time and would strip the lining of your stomach they are that strong!

 September 2014,5,Wonderful Food + Great Staff + Amazing Hotel = Best Holiday,"I went on holiday to this hotel for 11 nights with my Girlfriend on our first big holiday together. Everything about the place screamed luxury. The room we had was massive, it was like an apartment in itself (Junior Suite). Housekeeping did a wonderful job everyday keeping the room clean and it was a lovely touch to return to the room on the day of our 2 year anniversary with rose petals on the bed. The restaurants were all brilliant. I had read on here before going that the variety is not great in the buffet restaurant but I did not believe that to be the case. There was a lot of choice and it changed every day. I felt the theme nights (especially the Asian night) were also a nice extra. We ate at both of the optional restaurants with our favourite being the fusion restaurant…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The rooms were huge as was the bathroom and so nicely designed and furnished! We stayed on an all inclusive basis and the food was great - so much choice all cooked incredibly well. They also cater to a gluten free diet and cooked gf pancakes, pizza, pasta and many order to your requirement. The staff were very aware of this too and were more than happy to help! The restaurants in the hotel are worth a visit too and a visit is all included in the price. Lots of acitivies going on too if you wanted to join in!

 September 2014,5,Fantastic Hotel shame about the cats,"Just arrived home after a week in the Riu Palace Tikida. The rooms at the hotel were luxurious, facilities excellent and food choice/quality were second to none..... However the waiter service was very hit and miss, some brilliant some terrible. If you a not a fan of cats this is not the hotel for you. Feral cats roam the reception area and the Terrace Dining Area, this is because guests feed the cats. On several occasions I found small mounds of food on the floor in the Terrace Dining Area that guests had left out for the cats to eat. I am not a cat lover by any stretch of the imagination, however surely most would agree that petting and feeding feral cats and then using the communal buffet is incredibly UNHYGIENIC to say the least!!! I pointed this out to the Management Team…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,4,"Lovely hotel, shame about the resort","Agree with most other reviews posted- the Riu is a fantastic hotel. A few minor quibbles, the beds really aren't that comfortable, very hard. The food is a bit repetitive, albeit a good standard for this kind of AI hotel, a week was enough for us. The a la carte restaurants are good but the menus are limited so wouldn't want to visit more than once. The hotel is very very busy (although rep did say we were there in peak week of the season). The service was ok, but not amazing, certainly not 5 star. Positives- the most amazing pool area! Lovely comfy sunbeds and we did always manage to find a bed despite getting up late and the hotel being full. Love the fact you get a full bottle of wine and water left on your table even at lunchtime (or soft drink) so no need to worry about…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,4,Moroccan warm welcome,"We had previously checked out some of the reviews on this hotel prior to booking so we had high expectations and we were keen that the Tikida Palace would deliver. They always say first impressions count so when we arrived in the spacious reception area adorned with Moroccan lighting , decor and large display pieces of Berber art my wife and I thought we were in for a treat. The room we booked was on second floor, overlooking the pool area and beautifully maintained gardens. The room was fantastic our double room was large enough to be rented as a suite. It was nicely decorated in Moroccan theme with plenty of space to store cases and clothing. It's important to highlight that the hotel provided a safe FOC as, in my experience we are often charged for this. The staff in this…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2014,5,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed here for two weeks from 4th Sept, our stay got off to a flying start as we got upgraded to a suite, WOW what a room, it totally blew us away. The hotel has many positives going for it, including the very helpful and friendly staff (apart from 1 or 2 in the Salon Bar). Drinks quality was excellent with branded names, Jack Daniels etc., if you drink Vodka make sure you ask for Smirnoff otherwise they will give you the local stuff. The food was good but as always with A/I it gets repetitive; however we could always find something to our taste. You could always get a sunbed and the staff will locate a bed for you and carry an umbrella over however if you want a sunbed close to the pool etc. then you will need to get up early to bag one (around 7ish) .

Will also add that we stayed in this hotel previously, 2 weeks in May 2013 and returned again because we liked it so much. We were advised that the weather in September was better than May as it was extremely windy in May and we got sand blasted on the beach when brave enough to go there.

The room was on a split level, very spacious and stylishly decorated with twin sinks and a rainfall shower. Tea and coffee facilities. TV has English movie, news and music channels. Very nice overall but the downsides for us were that we found the beds very uncomfortable and hard, no iron and ironing board in rooms. We were woken up every morning by the cleaners in the next rooms who insisted in dragging the furniture across the rooms.

 September 2014,5,Top Hotel. Thoroughly recommended.,"It is easy to see why this this the top rated hotel in Agadir. The location is perfect, adjacent to the pedestrian promenade allowing great walks along the front. The food choice and quality is excellent, although the Crystal themed restaurant is very ordinary and not worth a visit. The service is great throughout the bars, restaurants and rooms. The entertainment is a bit naff though, but is the same at many international hotels where they try to accommodate different nationalities. The best rooms are undoubtedly those facing the pool. These have great sea views and are very quiet at night. Go for the top floors towards the end of the wings if possible. Be aware that phone calls from the hotel are about £2 per min to the UK. Mobile phone calls are also expensive. It may…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It was a long 4 hour coach drive but we eagerly anticipated the week ahead. There was no hotel welcome when we arrived, we presumed this was due to not being picked up from the airport? Also no welcome from the Thomson reps. Having checked in rather slowly we went to our rooms.

 August 2014,4,Great time but a little bit disappointing,"Before travelling to Agadir and the Palace Tikida Hotel, I spent quite a lot of time reading reviews on TA and so thought I should add my own now that I have been - despite the fact that most of what I have say has already been said. The hotel is absolutley stunning, large, well equipped rooms, spacious bathroom, efficient A/C. The bar areas and reception continue along the same lines, the pool is gorgeous and there are so many pretty areas to sit, waterfalls, and water features - gorgeous. Food was OK, plenty to choose from but did get a bit samey, I did have actually have what I believe to be mild food posioning which I think comes from the fact that the food is never properly hot.

I find them to be reliable and the reps to be professional and helpful. As expected from the reviews the hotel grounds and rooms are very impressive, both grand and clean. You can see that the building is not ageing well though, only 2 years old and some quite obvious signs that the hotel is already deteriorating. The vast majority of the staff are very friendly and quite hard working.

Good points: The room we stayed was lovely, lots of space, nice mini bar etc. Bad points: For me this is not a five star hotel as the SERVICE you recieve from the staff is AWFUL in my opinion. When we went to go to have our food in the buffet restaurant, whether its breakfast, lunch or Dinner, I was constantly having to get my own knife and fork, napkins etc for me if this is a five star it should be there already on the table. Also we had to keep calling the waiter/waitress over most of the time if you wanted to order a drink.

The place is spotless and cleaners are everywhere. You do not get treated like a second class citizen because your not French. The waiters are hard working, busy and very friendly, and if you do not get served within 20 seconds WAIT. you are on holiday chill out! There is a drinks trolley that comes around the pool but again if it doesnt come round as often as you would like get off your backside and go to the bar its about 20…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,"Nice, with a few reservations","Spent a week at the Riu Palace hotel last week. There are two things worth knowing about Agadir before deciding on a holiday there: if you go in August there is likely to be overcast weather every morning. It brightens up, generally, during the afternoon and gets quite hot, but not as hot as I feared for summer in Africa. It was really very pleasant. Many people on the week we were there were very disappointed in the weather and vowed never to go back in August because of the lack of sun for so much of the day. The other thing is that there is no history in Agadir. It is a totally new town, having been destroyed in an earthquake in 1960, so if you like looking round old buildings and monuments - there are none. We didn't know this so took a day trip to Marrakesh to make up for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,Quite good but rather noisy,"Just had 10 days at this Riu hotel, after requesting a quite room on the the top floor we were allocated what we asked for. The (pool rooms which are well worth paying for upgrade ) are very spacious and spotlessly clean, (thanks to our cleaner Fatima) . The hotel was rather noisy on a night due to unsupervised children , from Parents and hotel senior management ,this went on till well past midnight. This hotel would definitely benefit to be Adult only. There is a good selection food, well cooked , but on first morning at breakfast every plate in the restaurant was flat cold which is not good in a so called 5star hotel .However after a word with the manager by lunch time they were red hot. The Italian restaurant was very good the fusion was quite good but the food should be a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,3,Nice Hotel - could be better,"Overview. The hotel is situated on the seafront seperated by a promonade, weather is interesting as a lot of days we were there a sort of mist haze that rolls in and lowers the temperature down a lot, we did go July . Remember you are on the Atlantic coast and there is a big difference between inland and the coast in weather. hotel Shops - Poor, limited and shut early, if you like cigars or cigarettes bring them with you. Bars - Cocktails ok, but seem to vary form barman to barman, the bars are ok but you go away for outside drinking, and this bar closes around 10.30, thats poor.Service very hit or miss Food - The food was very good for an all inclusive, but have had better in the caribean. Pools - they were ok, pool bar was in a shady area, so when mist rolled in was a bit…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,"Beautiful hotel, but running down slowly (don't go in August!)","The hotel is HUGE. It is already starting to be run down. It does not deserve 5 stars whatsoever. POSITIVES: -a lot of staff! makes the service quick and efficient -majprity male restaurant and bar staff are very professional and friendly (depends on individuals though, it is no homogenous). Radouan from restaurant and Omar from bar are super professional and helpful. Women in the service either don't speak at all with you or are very unfriendly (mostly with other guest women) -spacy rooms -gorgeous swimming pool area -mostly very clean, except toilets in the swimming pool area in the morning -4 restaurants and several bars -big rain shower head with strong hot waterflow -many relaxing spaces with big comfy couches in the main hall -Agadir: secure and calm -24h security in…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,5,Excellent stay yet again!!,"Just returned from my 3rd trip in last 12 months and as always had an excellent stay. Hotel fantastic as always, food, rooms and staff amazing. Assistant manager Raphael very helpful when my case was missing on arrival at airport. Thomson Rep disinterested and informed not their responsibility informing me I had to travel via taxi to pick up luggage once found at a cost to myself. Also lost first day of holiday due to no clothes and lack of support from Thompson. This hotel is one of the best I have stayed at and will return to again. Tip ! Do not buy gifts from watch/jewellery shop opposite hotel as various people had bought watches that worked for a day and then stopped. Shop owner denied he had sold them watches and that they were bought from somewhere else! lots of people…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,A couple of tips for guests & a couple of messages for the hotel,"First off Tikida - the beach is almost completely void of hawkers, donkeys, camels & horses, as the water is of jet skis, para sails, wind surfers & kayaks. If all of this is your cup of tea then Tikida is not for you. If however you find all of the above as appealing as a festoring sore then Tikida is a paradise! Between the hotel & beach is a long & wide modern promenade full of joggers, walkers & cyclists (bikes for hire) with fixed exercise equipment placed throughout. There are a few street dogs that linger, but they're harmless. As for hotel choice - if you're contemplating 4 or 5 star go 5 star - we did 4 star last year & were happy we paid the extra - discernable upgrades at every turn. As for time, 1 week or 2 - 5 star buffet is still buffet - it gets old quick, they…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,Fantastic hotel spoilt only by the mist,"Just return from a 1 week stay in Agadir. Hotel fantastic. Rooms spacious and very clean. Pool area clean and spacious, however get up early to get a sunbed! When hotel full no space between sun beds, crammed in like sardines. Food lovely, always managed to find something to eat. Staff friendly and very helpful. Stayed in Riu Tikida Dunas in May and loved it but would prefer this hotel. Unfotunately didn't see the sun before 2pm all 7 days. In fact 4 of the days didn't see the sun at all! Although still got sun tan through mist. Don't goto Agadir if you want to see the sun, was the same in May but worse in August.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,one weeks hoilday for 3,"The hotel was very nice and very large. This was a problem with my wife who as early Alzheimers Disease and found the main resturant area way to large. the food was very good and plentiful.The Moracan food was good.You will put on weight! The room was ample size for me my wife and my 24 year old daughter, it was on the fourth floor. We were in a room on the ground floor but I asked to be moved after the first day as this smelt of sewage, there was no problem with my request it was done there and then. The only issues we had was, I had asked the reception if I could book to keep my room on until 5pm and was fine with paying the extra on the Tuesday they asked me to come back nearer the time of departure on Thursday.

 August 2014,5,Amazing hotel!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week in the middle of August. We were welcomed with a lovely drink and our cases were delivered to our room. It was late so we headed straight to the bar. When this hotel says 'All inclusive', it means it. All drinks are brand names and there is a wide selection on the menu. There is also a good cocktail menu. The lobby bar is also 24 hours so you are never kicked out. The rooms are spacious and beautifully presented. Mini bar and tea and coffee making facilities. The bed was hard although my boyfriend thought it was fine. The food was gorgeous and always a wide selection especially for lunch and dinner. We booked a table at the Marrakech and Krystal restaurants both of which were excellent. The staff were extremely friendly and despite…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,5,Fantastic hotel and lovely staff,"We have just returned from our two weeks holidays in Agadir. I could not find many faults in this hotel. The staff is lovely; nothing is too much for them. The buffet food does feel repetative when eating for two weeks but there is plenty of choices so no issues there either. We were there with our two teenage sons and even they were so happy that we did not have to worry about. The managers Roi and Raphael were always out and about and speaking with the guests. The Thompsons reps Hasan and John were ever so friendly and helpful, specially Hasan was very informative. Our rooms were on ground floor, at the rear of the hotel so it was very close to the swimming pool/beach. Which was a definitely added bonus since we did not need to have a long walk to go to our room when coming…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Fantastic honeymoon destination!,"We spent 2 weeks here for our honeymoon with our 2 year old. It was truly stunning. The food was amazing, each restaurant had something new to offer and were equally spectacular. The pool was clean, modern and great for us to relax in and for us to splash around with our son. The staff were attentive, polite, and there were plenty of staff around at all times. Would recommend to all and will visit again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,A palace in the sun?..,"Just got back from 2 weeks at the RIU Palace Agadir and have to say it doesn't live up to the hype. Let me say my wife and I have stayed in Riius almost exclusively for the last 15 years and most of them Palace class. The hotel is good but not very good or excellent. This is a new hotel opened a couple of years ago and it's already starting to show signs of wear and tear. The rooms are spacious enough but don't come equpped t as advertised, no optics for instance, which are commonly omitted in most Palace class Riu's as they are 24 hrs all inclusive so why advertise you have them? The furnishings are very basic and storage space is minimal if not in fact lacking. The sliding doors to one of the hanging spaces were constantly coming off! The beds are shockingly firm bordering…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,5,Fantastic hotel with lovely staff.,"We have just come back from our two week holiday and had a great time. The hotel was wow and the staff made us feel very welcome. A big thank you to the assistant managers Roi and Rafael who helped me and my daughter, nothing was too much. The hotel is situated in a great place and we hired bikes on the promenade a couple of times and went for walks during the day and the evening. The food was very tasty and if you needed anything (for food allergies) they would make it or get it. Loved the riu fit and enjoyed the classes thoroughly also the animation team were a great set of lads. Our room was facing over the promenade but this was not a bad thing as the rooms are gorgeous with everything that you need and more. There is a sea mist in the morning but don't let this put you off…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,5,Lovely hotel and good location but beware of sea mist,"We have stayed in many 5 star resort all-inclusive hotels around the world and this hotel was on a par with them in many ways. People should be aware that if they decide to go for meals or drinks at the busiest times of the day anywhere, they are going to have to wait to get waiters to attend to them or queue in the restaurant for food being cooked. We only experienced this once on our last day, but at other times we got a good service and sometimes pretty special one, even without tipping. As with other reviewers, we found that if you did tip someone, they tried to go that extra mile for you when they were not busy, which was lovely. My husband and I were aware of the issues with the mist and fog in July and August after booking a year ago and seeing it on trip adviser,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,5,Fantastic family holiday! :),"Stayed here at the end of July with my boyfriend, my parents and my brother and his family – we had a fantastic time! We all had rooms facing the pool on the ground floor and almost had our very own beautiful gardens! We stayed for 10 nights and would definitely recommend this hotel for a big family holiday – mainly because everything we needed was in the hotel and the grounds. We do normally like to travel around the local area but that isn’t great in Agidir, but as it was a family celebration holiday the hotel was fab! Great pool, lovely restaurants, lovely surroundings and very helpful staff. Sometimes the food in the buffets was a bit limited and quite repetitive but still a high standard. The Crystal restaurant was very very good – make sure your make a reservation early as…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,5,"BEST HOTEL "" COULD NOT FAULT IT """,Just come back from 10 days in this hotel and I can honestly say I could not fault it. We asked for 2 rooms over looking pool and next door to each other and that's what we got. The rooms were lovely and big and cleaned every day with drinks in fridge which were replaced daily (free) and believe it or not tea and coffee. Plenty of bars which serve branded drinks and food was excellent. Do not panic about sunbeds the poolside ones did go early but the area is big and you could still get beds at any time of day because the staff would find them for you. In all inclusive terms this is 5 Star and people who moan about this hotel are just trying to find fault. We did not go to beach but it is ok ( not the best I have seen though ). This is a resort for relaxing as there is not much…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,3,Riu Palace,"Good points, clean, nice rooms, staff are friendly. Let down points, it's the first five star hotel I've been to with no food room service menu. Also, men have to wear trousers in the all inclusive buffet restaurant whilst the ladies can don a bikini top and short skirt....can totally understand trousers in the a'la carte but not the buffet, seems a bit pointless. The buffet itself offers very little choice or variety, the foods ok but very boring, very little imagination. And finally, for the teenagers...... (and this more than anything drove my 15yr old crazy) no wifi in the rooms and the wifi that is available in reception and around the pool is pathetic.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We ate in the fusion restaurant twice, both times they were outstanding. My favourite. We also ate in the Moroccan which was also brilliant my boyfriend's favourite he loved it. You get 4/ 5 courses waiter service in them, nice and chilled. We ate also lunch in the restaurant at hotel which over looked the beach which was nice.

Lovely to eat lunch with beach right next to you. Hire bikes on promenade right outside hotel and cycle to lovely marina. The only let down for this hotel is the evening entertainment which was very poor. It's a real shame as the animation team are certainly enthusiastic but they need a choreographer to organise their routines as they are so out of time with one another and there is no story to their performance. Even when they brought people from outside the hotel the evening entertainment was very poor. Having said this, it would not stop me going to this hotel as it makes up for it in so many other ways. P.s. Don't go on…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The suite was quite amazing but the view was obliterated by the roof from the ""Italian restaurant"" - we spoke to the reception who actually said ""we were being very difficult""!!!!! They eventually agreed to change us to a higher room, which was equally as lovely, albeit a little smaller. The only problem we then had was the most awful smell. It was on a par with drains. We again spoke to reception, who sent someone up, who said they couldn't smell it. Whenever our kids came in they gagged with the smell. We asked again for someone to come and look - they also looked at us as if we were crazy. We asked the cleaner, she said that she cleans the room, it is clean and thats it.

 August 2014,5,A proper 5* hotel experience,"I have stayed at this hotel twice. If you want the full 5 star experience then this is the hotel to choose. We have stayed at many all inclusive hotels in the past but when these guys say all inclusive they really do mean it. Their drinks aren't just cheap local drinks as they include all the ones we're used it in the Uk, including Jack Daniels. The lunch and dinner menus are extensive and the food was always up to scratch - no upset stomachs for us! The only thing that was slightly lacking was the breakfast. I wasn't keen as their wasn't much variety and the beans were horrible. But again this is a small gripe. After trying the breakfast on the first day I opted to have tea/coffee and a bread/cake selection delivered to the room every morning instead. Again this was free,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,5,5 Star for sure,"Have you noticed how the star rating in some countries doesn't match our own assumptions of 4 star, 5 stars etc. Well in this case it really is a 5 star hotel. It has 444 lovely rooms. Only one area for improvement and this is the towel to reserve your place at the pool issue. In the in room hotel guide it says this should not be done. Also there is a sign at the pool that says towels can't reserve the sun loungers. This is a toothless policy as it is not enforced. But don't let that influence you too much as everything else was wonderful.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2014,4,Not quite the Riu we're used to,"Arrived at this hotel after a 4 hour trip from Marrakech by coach transfer, a long trip but it was fine.

Pool enormous but there were hardly any gardens to walk through as with other Riu's we've stayed at. Food was good & plenty of choice. Had one meal in the Krystal Restaurant & it was very nice, different, made a change from the usual buffet. Beach a big let down. Busy all the time & dirty. We are big beach lovers but we didn't sit on the sand once, one paddle was enough.

 August 2014,3,Questionable locals,"Hotel rooms are above average and food is excellent, most staff are pleasant and helpful with odd exceptions, excellent assistant manager Raphael. The big problems are 1 when out and about watch your daughters, particularly if blonde, some of the gestures and comments to our 12&14 year old by old men are frankly disgusting and in UK they would be locked up. 2 don't come in August, the mix of sea current and locality of mountain causes a mist and cloudy overcast environment all day which eventually clears at around 5 and sun shines through. This is normal at this time of year but we never saw it on any review, If you want a bit of activity and music then this hotel is not for you, most clientele complain if too much noise or music is played so it's all a bit quite.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The lobby was nice and quiet, always managed to find somewhere to sit and drink cocktails! Saw a couple of shows too which we enjoyed.

Free wifi in reception and pool areas but not in the rooms. The beach is lovely and clean and the area is definitely up and coming. The downside for us was that there was no where for the teenagers to mingle. There were many bored looking teenagers with their parents who looked like they would have enjoyed an organised disco/club evening. There was table tennis tennis, a pool table and table football (for which there was a charge) but these were often being used by the adults. Entertainment wasn't very good and they could easily improve this by perhaps having a beach party one night, barbequeing round the pool, area perhaps.

They do remember who tips and you end up with even better service if that's possible!! The rooms are beautiful and the whole hotel is spotless. We have seen a lot of comments about the bad entertainment but please ignore them. Not sure what people want from it!! What happened to the art of conversation!!

I tend to stay clear of package/ all inclusive hotels. However with young twins, my mother talked me into giving this style of holiday a go. If you are expecting Four Seasons standard of five star then you will be bitterly disappointed. This is a tourist five star which is more akin to a four star hotel but a fairly good one at that and the joy is that the price reflects this. It has many good qualities: Plus points: Hotel is spotless, rooms, communal areas and gardens are beautifully kept Room is modern, aesthetically pleasing and an excellent size - true five star rating Service is excellent - staff are friendly, fantastic with children and work incredibly hard.

The best service I've ever had at an all inclusive resort. The food is delicious, something for everyone, all though right now ( I'm still in the resort until Monday) it's very busy and can feel a little chaotic at peak times. the Moroccan restaurant food was somewhat disappointing, for example the Harira soup tasted like tinned soup from England, and I think overall the 2 a la carte restaurants need to do slightly better with their menus. the Italian whilst not A la Carte !

 July 2014,5,Fabulous Holiday,"Visited for a week in July and regretting we didn't book for longer we enjoyed ourselves so much. Be careful when you get to the airport, there will be men waiting near the coaches ready to take your bag off you to carry it over to your coach, they will then demand English money, I witnessed one man getting very aggressive with a woman because she didn't have any English money on her and our coach driver had to give him some to make him go away. I've read reviews about the food being repetitive, I can see where they're coming from maybe at lunch but I found the food varied at dinner every night as they had a different theme each night.

There were no problems and I think the variety of nationalities meant people were fairly evenly dispersed in terms of when they used the restaurants so no queues for tables or food. More guests ( mainly English) have arrived and the hotel now feels fuller, and at times, everyone seems to be wanting to eat earlier so the dining room seems a bit busier. Staff have remained incredibly…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,3,Relaxing resort,"Visited recently for a week's family holiday. First ever resort style holiday so hard to compare to other places. Highlights for me were the excellent swimming pools and poolside area. Plenty of sporty activities from pétanque to aquafit classes. The buffet style breakfast, lunch and dinner was varied and tasty and the rooms were comfortable and clean, our third floor view of the pool was great. The staff were great, especially Omar in the dining room! Lowlights, the evening entertainment was embarrassingly amateur, so evenings were spent in the hotel lobby. The specialist a la carte Moroccan restaurant was disappointing but try Le Mauresque close by for the real deal. The kids club was of no appeal to my 7 year old son, but that was OK since we went out and about most days…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,5,Fantastic holiday,"For us this was an amazing holiday. The cleaning staff worked relentlessly, the bar and waiting staff were very attentive regardless of your nationality or if they were tipped, the food was good, my partner is very fussy and always found something he liked. The only thing that let the hotel down was the entertainment, for us it wasn't too bad but for families or people wanting a party atmosphere I think they might be a little disappointed. All in all a great relaxing holiday for us",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,5,Already Booked for a second visit...,"What can I say what an excellent hotel, Food was amazing it was my boyfriends birthday and he was greeted by rose petals on the table very attentive staff a beautiful cake and a birthday song. The staff were all excellent nothing was too much trouble, Riu made sure our room had champagne, fruit and cakes on arrival felt really spoilt. Although we paid for all inclusive we still tipped nearly every day just 20 dirhams to the person you feel gave you good service, this is only around £1.20 and well worth it and a thank you to all the staff goes a long way some holiday makers forgot their manners!!!! Drinks and cocktails are fabulous but be warned they are very strong and I had to order an extra coke to water it down. The Cuba libres were the best I ever had. The hotel rep was a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,3,Riu needs to sort this hotel out,"Just returned home from a week's stay at the Riu Palace Tikida, Agadir. Very disappointing holiday, Food is of a good quality but it is monotonous. Both Riu and Thomson should stop misrepresenting this hotel as having three a la carte restaurants as the Italian is anything but and is the same food served again in the evenings as at lunch time and is just the same buffet. Trying to book one of the restaurants in this hotel is a thankless task. We contacted the hotel prior to leaving the Uk to say that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and asked if we could reserve a table at one of the a la carte restaurants but this request was denied. On arriving we again tried to book a table but were told that this wasn't possible until the next day, only to find that bookings…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,3,Good hotel with a boring location,Me and my family visited this hotel resort end of May 2014 for 6 days. First impression when being dropped off outside the hotel was good. Clean and grand entrance area to the main reception. The main reception was slightly busy as many other flights had arrived late evening. Me and family were very tired from our long journey and disaster faced at Agadir airport (lost luggage!) so we wanted to eat and simply check in. We were shown the main dining area and happy to see the sight of food. But arriving 10:30 pm at the hotel meant the food available was zero to none. Next day we woke up for breakfast and was greeted to a good variety of foods! The great thing is if you miss the main breakfast you can also opt for the second timing of 11 am. Lunch was not bad except the variety…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,"Great hotel, excellent service and delicious food. Does need to jazz things up a little with enternainment","Truly excellent hotel. Spotlessly clean everywhere. Excellent service and absolutely delicious food! Real cocktails are mixed in all bars, they look pretty and taste good. Premium drinks are also part of all inclusive. Rooms are spacious and well air conditioned. Moroccan and fusion restaurants are great. Italian is buffet though, which i thought was wrong as there is buffet restaurant already and it occupies best spot right on a promenade. Live entertainment every night (shows and singer or a band in main bar). I was a bit disappointed that live entertainment finished abound 11pm and around midnight it felt like retirement home. They even switched lights off around pool area at 11pm which was a shame as it is beautiful. Beach is other side of promenade, does not feel like…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,All inclusive and didn't put on a pound.,December 2013 all inclusive break with Thomsons on their late deals site. There were two themed restaurants one European and one Moroccan. Both were very good as was the general buffet style option. I had always avoided all inclusive holidays but thanks to the gym and exercise classes we both avoided even a pound of weight gain in spite of all the extra food we ate which was all top quality and had a huge choice. You are right next to a lovely beach with a huge stretch of golden sands. The entertainment was very mixed some acts were brilliant others hopeless but they were very entertaining because they were so bad. At £420 each the value was hard to beat. We will return.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,True 5* Hotel,"I have to admit it was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. I'm trying hard to think about any negatives but nothing comes to mind. The hotel itself is beautiful, the pool area lovely and very relaxing. However, if you like a lot of entertainment and loud music by the pool, Riu Palace is not for you - there is no music, not even in the background. Food was absolutely amazing (not many AI hotels serve monkfish and cod loin!). I wish I had asked for some of the recipes! Staff fantastic, very attentive and polite. Always there when you need them. Beach was beautiful and clean, tends to get very busy at the weekends as all local people use it (it's not a private beach - there is an area reserved for the hotel but no beach staff as such and there is no beach bar). As for the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Excellent all-inclusive,"We stayed here for a family holiday (6 adults, 1 toddler) in June and loved it. The rooms were spacious, clean and modern, with substantial balconies. HOWEVER, be warned, if you have toddlers, there are two stone steps in every room (to divide the living space from the bedroom area). We asked the hotel if they could switch our room but apparently they all have these steps, and they had nothing they could block it off with. We found that 3 suitcases laid end-to-end filled the gap and stopped our 18 month old from tripping down them. My only other complaint about the room was that it was not a double bed - just two singles pushed together, and not even made up with double bedding. A really sad oversight for a plush hotel. The food here was excellent, with the Moroccan…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,5,Beautiful hotel and excellent value for money,"Just returned from a week here and so glad I chose this over the Dunas which I was also considering. The latter was probably at its best 20 years ago; this is brand, spanking new and very stylish. The lobby/reception/lounge area is fabulous! I have stayed in some nice hotels but this probably topped the lot for style. Room (4030 - top floor, pool view) was also lovely and very comfortable. Good beds, good shower - very clean. We had one minor issue with a reservation for the Moroccan restaurant ( we turned up for our booked table at 9pm and were rather rudely sent away because others were lingering too long over their meals). But Roy - a manager who is very much in evidence around the place - eventually sorted us out with a table for another night. The food is excellent…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,A-ma-zing,"Me and me family ( parents, children 19-19-23) went to riu palace septembre 2013. We just loved it here. Beautiful hotel. The food was just really good, enough choice. The restaurant with view on the sea is great. The staff there is also really friendly. The pool was just amazing, with a poolbar with delicious cocktails. The rooms are spacious and have all what you need. The weather was also really good when we went there. We did some acitivities such as going to a big covered market, and then a tour arround agadir, we also went surfing. Also for people who dont like surfing, it's just aa really beautiful spot they called it the devils rock, its just amazing to stand there on the top of the rock, you just have an breathtaking view, in our opinion. We surely recommend this…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,5,Fantastic Hotel - Amazing Staff,"Easy journey from the airport, very impressive hotel with the hardest working and very generous staff. Friendly, so very clean, beautiful food. What more could one want? No air toys in pool, proper dress code for dinner. We had a magnificent time travelling with teenager and 10 year old. Perfect place for relaxing, a good book, board games and some exploring. Yes, you would have to be up early if you wanted specific place by pool but after a few days that became less important. The pool area is well considered in its design with different levels. Animation team energetic and enthusiastic but does not harass you. They were a real asset together with exercise team!. Bar areas excellent for late afternoon drinks. Our junior suites with pool view were large with good wardrobe space,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,5,Excellent value with London hotel ambience,Third time we have visited and would visit again. Lovely feel about the hotel with a modern ambience to the whole hotel. Food is great for choice and bars and lounge areas make the hotel feel really special. We had a great room with a huge balcony with both sea and pool view. Loads of room around the pools to sunbathe. A late checkout as standard should be included though!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,WOW..WOW..WOW..,"These three words are the only way to explain the hotel, from the moment you walk through the doors. Personally I never read comments about hotels because it scares me if they are bad, but this one I am glad I did! Majority off the bad comments are people nit picking and if you are like me and my partner and let the little things slide then you will enjoy your holiday to the full! Yes the tables are close together in the main restaurant, but with as many rooms as they have they need to cater!! but we ate outside every night so it didn't bother us. Pool area is gorgeous. We had a 'Junior Suite' or should I say FLAT!! Wow just totally amazing I even lost my partner at times. Here it seems you pay for the room or the view and we are completely satisfied with the room over the view…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,5,Les and Anne Riu Palace Agadir,"Lovely Hotel, almost brand new. Very Very good food something for everyone and cooked and produced to a very high standard. There were lots of people in the hotel which made getting a seat round the pool difficult. The towel trip at 0600 was in operation, even though it was not allowed. The staff were brilliant, all had a sense of humour and were brisk and efficient. Lunch is in a restaurant by the pool, all the usual things were available, pizza, chips, fish and all kinds of meat, there is plenty of it. Beats me where some people put it all. The all inclusive drinks are very acceptable and served with a smile. There is some evening entertainment if you want it. Lovely beach just across the promenade that takes you to Agadir. If you like trips go on the Atlas mountains its…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,4,Cleanest hotel I've ever been to!,"Not very far from the airport; staff extremely friendly & polite.

Would definitely go back again.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,4,Relaxation,"We stayed here for 5 nights towards the end of our 3 week honeymoon throughout morocco. For the most part we had been travelling quite a bit so it was very nice to finally be able to sit back and relax for a while at a beautiful resort. The lobby is large and very beautiful, a great place to sit to enjoy a drink, some music or just to relax. The pool was large, clean and very comfortable. Tons of chairs poolside and bars to grab a mid day drink or two. But make sure you wake up early to reserve your chairs as they filled up quick. The staff were extremely friendly, always saying hello and offering some activity they had planned. There was always someone nearby in case you needed something or had a question to ask. The food was quite good for a large resort with many options…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,5,Lovely Hotel,This hotel is lovely and clean. Pool area is beautiful. The food is really nice and plenty of choice. No optics in room (Riu Palace in Cancun did).

Loved the Moroccan tea. Loads of food choice, restaurants were huge and fancy. Definitely 5star. Just down the road to casinos and night clubs if that's your scene. Beach on the doorstep.

Myself & my husband don't go on holiday looking for negatives but these things naturally came to our attention.. The hotel is very big therefore very busy.. The pool area lovely, clean but very busy! Its not the relaxing atmosphere you would expect as it can get quite noisy, after the end of the first week we noticed more children arriving & was getting even busier & noisier, we would usually go to a couples only hotel but there isn't one in Agadir (or Tompson don't offer one anyway) So we decided to spend the 2nd week on the beach, we would usually choose the beach over the pool anyway but the reason we didn't to begin with is because there is a restricted…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 February 2014,4,very good hotel,"In february we have been a week to AgadirMorroco) We were surprised by the lovely interieur of the lobby, such beatiful pieces of art. Our room was very spacy, clean and nice furnished. The restaurant had a lot of choise on the buffet. and this especially in the morning and for dinner,and also it tasted very good and always warm. The garden was well maintained. In one word marvellous. Here we'll go back for one of our next holidays!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Amazing!,"This is the first all inclusive holiday i've been on and it was perfect. Food was great, hotel itself is really nice. When you first walk into the lobby it's huge, there is always somewhere to sit, its never too crowded apart from the evening when there is entertainment on. Food selection is pretty good in the buffet restaurant. The Krystal restaurant is the nicer once out of 3 you can book. Moroccan is not that great. italian again is buffet style. Hotel rooms are very nice, clean and maid always make up your room. Only issue we had was where I accidentally forgot to put my purse away which was in my handbad, which I left in the room. When I came back around midday after the maid had been, my purse had been opened and 100dirhams had been taken. This was not left out as a tip.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 June 2014,5,Amazing holiday! 2 weeks of luxury!,"This was my far the best RIU hotel I've stayed in. The hotel on first impressions was WOW! The reception area was beautiful. We were checked in quickly and given our room. The hotel is so big me and my partner did actually get lost trying to find our room. The rooms are spacious and very modern. However we did have two single beds put together, this didn't bother us really. Mini fridge was restocked everyday with branded soft drinks. The pool area was FAB! Reserving sun beds was not an issue, we would get up at 8 and have very good beds. There was pool attendants you could bribe but we didn't feel the need. There seems to be a lack of umbrellas though so be careful when going for lunch, another hotel resident could tip the pool attendant for a umbrella and he would then take…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The staff for us made this holiday artfully wonderfull experience. They chat and banter, they remember you and treat you like royalty. The hotel rooms are a great size with everything you need. We had room 2141 and we had a side sea view and could watch the locals as they came out at night. The pool is fantastic, excellent food choice, we tried all the speciality restaurants all good.

 June 2014,5,Great place to relax,"I spent 6 nights here in June. Though the weather was scorching the fantastic outdoor pools and open bars meant we could keep cool. Service by the staff was impeccable, they are very approachable and friendly. If you get get chatting with them, they will go above and beyond to help you out. The standard rooms are incredibly generously sized, and the hotel decor is all high ceilings and grandeur, with plenty of open spaces to relax. Food is generally very good, but is on about a 5-7 day cycle so you'd start to see the same stuff again if you stay too long, however you can break this up by visiting the book-in restaurants. Krystal the fusion restaurant is a must and they also serve better wine than is available elsewhere in the hotel!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,3,This is a 4star hotel at best,"Ok so we just got back from this all inclusive holiday at the Riu palace and first impressions from me an my partner were 'Wow this was huge!'. We were kindly greeted with a drink at reception whilst our bags were taken to our room whilst we checked in an had dinner - and this was the first problem....our bags took hours to arrive to our room with us having to call reception numerous times from the room to find out where our bags were! More little problems later emerged throughout the holiday such as no wifi in the bedroom, unless you have a laptop... These days who takes laptop on holiday! To cut a long story short this was NO WHERE NEAR 5star but more of a good 4star hotel. The all inclusive aspect lived up to the title but it seems that they've forgotten about quality along…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Honest Review,Firstly the hotel is amazing and probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Try to ignore fussy reviews as most of the criticisms are exaggerated or false. First impressions are stunning- the hotel is immaculate and inside decor is very grand. We were welcomed with a cocktail when we checked in late Thursday night- check in was quick and our baggage was bought up to our room for us. We requested a 4th floor room from the other reviews and it was well worth requesting; the main hotel lobby area is situated on the 3rd floor. The room was perfect and had a stocked mini bar. Everything was secure and had a free digit safe which was helpful. The pool area was always clean and everything was perfect including the landscaping/grounds etc. As per usual there were people reserving…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Amazing,I have to say that this hotel for the money you pay is amazing . We have stayed in some very expensive hotels and you expect it to be amazing but this was really good for the money you pay . We arrived at 9:30 evening and were met with a drink and a band then shown to the restaurant for our evening meal ( my husband travelled in jeans but if you were in shorts they put a cold buffet on for you at 10:30 ) they have a long pants in the evening rule and people say they didn't know but if you book a hotel surly you research it first and it's all over trip advisor that this is a rule for evening meal . After dinner we checked in and this was fast and our luggage was delivered with in 10 minutes to our room . I emailed the hotel a couple of weeks before requesting a top floor room…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,2,Not 5* service,"I did not enjoy my stay at this hotel at all. Although the hotel itself is nice and clean, the service is so poor that we ended up having bets if the drinks we ordered would ever arrive (on several occasions they did not.) They do not let you have a bottle of water and only let you have a glass at at time, which would be ok if the glasses were not so small. Saying this, the waiting staff at all the restaurants were slightly better as they gave you a bottle of wine and bottle of water at the beginning of your meal but that's it, so if you wanted a bottle of water without the wine, you are refused! On several occasions I witnessed people feeding stray cats in several different restaurants, this was accepted by the staff. The pool is only suitable for fit and active people who…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Brilliant hotel and holiday!,"Stayed at the Palace for 7 nights from mid June. There are a LOT of conflicting reviews on here regarding this hotel which, due to its size (think it's about 440 rooms), is understandable. Safe to say I had my concerns that the hotel wouldn't live up to expectations from this, but it certainly did (for a couple both mid twenties) and hopefully I can help others put their minds at rest! ROOMS: Fantastic. I'm honestly curious to know where people who have reviewed them badly have previously stayed. Would certainly recommend a pool view room. We stayed in a double, not a suite, but if you're staying as a couple then you have plenty of space and luxury as it is. Lovely big bed, flashy bathroom (his and hers sinks, bidet that I was too scared to try...!). Worth pointing out that…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Fistly BRING TROUSERS!!!! The hotel have a strict policy for evening that all gentlemen have to wear long trousers, my partner had only bought smart suit shorts and we had to go out and purchase trousers in order to be allowed in the restaurant. When we spoke to the manager about the problem having no trousers to wear he was VERY rude and explained that he had two choices either buy trousers, or i had to pick his dinner for him and he had to dine in his room.

 June 2014,5,A palace fit for a princess....or prince!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Tikida Palace from 16th June for 7 nights and what a faultless experience we had. This was both our first time to Morocco and after reading some of the reviews in regards to the weather and service I started to become dubious about what was in store. The interior of the entire hotel including the rooms were breathtaking. The rooms in particular were a lot larger than what initially expected with a more than spacious bathroom and balcony. For the hour or two needed to kill in between coming in from the pool and tea-time, they were a good selection of English channels on the TV to chose from. The mini-bar was stocked up daily with alcoholic and fizzy drinks as well as bottled water and was an absolute god-send after needing something cold to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2014,4,Amazing! shame about the beach,"Me and my family have just returned from a 7 day stay at the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. This hotel definitely lived up to expectations, even if the location of the hotel didn’t. The hotel is set on a promenade which you have to walk across to get to the ‘’private’’ section of the beach, which is just a roped off section of the main beach. During our stay we never visited the beach, as we went to see what the beach was like one day and it was absolutely full of the local men which was slightly intimidating for us. The promenade however was nice, and we walked down it a few times to the small marina which is definitely worth a visit. Out of the front of the hotel is a small row of shops selling anything from clothes, to souveniers. The hotel was amazing, it was always clean and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,4,Good But .........,"First impressions of hotel were brilliant. Quick check in and they sent you straight into dinner as we arrived at 10pm. Room was big and very clean, air con was not working properly so the room was warm and clammy at night. The bed was very hard but after asking for a topper this was done immediately which made the bed bearable. As with other reviews food was good but being there for 2 weeks it was samey. My husband went down with food poisoning on the 4th day which put him in bed for 2 days vomiting, when he did return to the land of the living we went to dinner and he noticed that the meat chief was using the same tongs for the raw chicken and removing the cooked chicken from the grill, we reported this to the Thompson rep who said it was unacceptable and would report it to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,4,Late June 2014 - Overall 4* Holiday,"Me and my partner have just returned from a 7day stay in the Riu Palace in Agadir. The hotel itself is amazing to look at, very clean and modern. The bar staff are very welcoming and the maids are really polite and grateful for small tips. Whilst we visited morocco the month of Ramadan started and we were advised that the service in the hotel would not compromise during our stay, however this was not the case for all members of staff , although most bar staff were still happy to help with a smile. We noticed that the main buffet room was not open every day for lunch but the smaller beach front buffet bar still served food. - which got very busy!

 June 2014,5,BEAUTIFUL... but...,"Me and my sister recently returned from staying in this hotel, and wow. First impressions were amazing, as soon as you enter the hotel the reception is beautiful, greeted with drinks. We arrived around 10:00pm, and as we reached reception we were told not to worry, to go for something to eat and return for check in. Check in was so simple and easy, our bags were then passed on and delivered to our room numerous minutes later. There is no exaggeration when I say the staff will go to the ends of the earth for you!, They're so lovely, always wanting to say hello or have a small conversation. The rooms are as expected, big and spacious, comfortable beds and a lovely bathroom. Cleaned to a high standard. We really wish we would have taken the opportunity to get pool view as our room…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Faultless!!,"Having just returned from this hotel and read some of the more recent reviews (which are mainly positive) I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone can criticise this place!! It is the best all inclusive I've ever stayed in and beats the Sensatori brand hands down!! The outbound flight was smooth and on time, transfer process quick and easy. We were able to get dinner in the buffet restaurant despite arriving at 10pm and then checked in quickly and easily. The food was amazing throughout the week and we tried all of the restaurants. Of course there may be some things not to everyone's taste but isn't this half the fun of going on holiday to try new things?

 August 2013,3,Enjoyable stay but beware of time of year you go!!,"First impressions of the hotel were very good, it was clean, the staff were welcoming and friendly. Check in was very quick and we were off to our room. The room itself was clean and large, the air con wasnt brilliant and we never seemed to be able to get it to work that well. The bathroom was a large size with a dressing area, I wasnt keen on the slatted doors for toilet/bathroom etc as I dont think it affords enough privacy. (not everyone is travelling with their partner.) The pool area was nice but crowded, we never had the issue with the sun beds because we are early risers so were down by the pool reading by 0730 each day but there was a lot of bed reserving going on. It seems tipping the pool boys means you get whatever bed you want. I dont have an issue with this…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,A truly wonderful experience,"My husband and I both stayed at this hotel mid june. Again, as many other people who have commented, we were worried about a few of the reviews which gave the hotel a poor rating. However , we were not disappointed at all. We were looking for a type of holiday where we could totally relax and be spoilt and we were over the moon that we had chosen Riu palace, as this was the place to do that. I have never stayed in such a clean hotel. The hotel is immaculate, in a wonderful setting. The staff couldnt do enough to help you, they were so polite. The food was superb, so much choice, and non repetitive. Probably too nice really as I did over indulge once or twice !!! The restaurant could be noisy at busy times but we tended to eat a little later to avoid this. My only regret is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Fantastic getaway,"We have just returned from our first trip to Morocco having spent 3 nights in Marrakech and then 7 nights in Agadir.We could not fault the Palace at all, easily the best holiday hotel we have ever stayed in.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,4,Almost there,"Lovely modern hotel. Good sized rooms, well appointed but could do with a few more drawers. If you are used to the refinery offered in Riu Palaces then the main dining room here will disappoint - its very much like a canteen. The Krystal Fusion and Moroccon restaurant are very good but the Italian restaurant lets itself down badly. No waiter service (except for drinks) and the food is just buffet style - serving pretty much what you get in there at lunchtime - only less of it. Palaces offer international drinks and the variety at this hotel was pretty poor. The hotel grounds are lovely and well kept and the hotel is ideally situated on the promenade so you can walk for miles either on the beach or the concrete walkway. Well worth a visit, but if you are used to the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Great hotell with excellent service,"Had a 5 day stay here with my wife, and a really enjoyed every single bit what the hotel had to offer, from a great welcoming and a quick check in at the reception to great and really nice food. The hotel is really nice and big, with great views over the the sea and the sunset over it, that is if ure in to that. The swimmingpool is big and divided in two sections with a pool with two poolbars, one where you can order while ure still in the pool while the other is just a few meters on the other side of the pool. The service level is at its best at the hotel, and i felt that every one was doing theyre best to make us feel comfortable. The rooms are nice and big and well maintained, and the cleaning ladies did a great job to, and dig actually come back to clean our room when se…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,5,Perfect Holiday,Being a young couple with our heart set on going to morocco- finding this deal with such a great looking hotel was a dream come true. We were a bit worried after reading reviews that it wasn't going to live up to standards however it outdid them all. We arrived late and even though they had ensured food was available we enjoyed our welcome drink and wandered up to our room. We had a 4th floor room near the lift- we didn't hear a peep on any of the nights! We ate at both Marrakech and Krystal restaurants which were both lovely- id say I preferred the food at Marrakech as it was more traditional but both were lovely. I did welcome the bigger wine glasses in Krystal as everywhere else in the hotel they were very small which meant as soon as you took a sip the waiter would be…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,Lovely hotel with a touch of luxury,"Our third visit to this super hotel and we were very happy to find it just as good as ever. I don’t need to reiterate the many superb reviews so will try to add some new or different information here together with some pointers for first time visitors. There was a mix-up with our room for the first night and, although we had booked a sea-view junior suite, we ended up in one with a side view. This was soon rectified and we were upgraded to a full suite so no complaints! ROOM TIP: Don’t bother booking a Junior Suite unless you are prepared to pay even more for a sea view. Internally the room was lovely but the terrace view was poor and provided no privacy either for ourselves or the neighbouring balconies, both of which we overlooked. All rooms have good sized wardrobes with…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Fantastic,"Travelled with Thomson , Hassan our local rep was fantastic , very knowledgable , and taught us how to barter! The hotel is very large and does cater for a lot of people , yet service was fantastic and everyone made you feel welcome. The food variety is unbelievable , every taste and choice is catered for, something for everyone , wasn't keen on the cocktails, too lemony , but the other drinks were fine , a mix of local wines and spirits , but also had jack Daniels , grants whisky , 3 barrels brandy , disarrono , and other known brands . Bedrooms are spacious , and modern , small fridge filled daily with soft drinks cans and beers , the beds are huge , and I found them comfy .

 June 2014,2,Butlins meets Faulty Towers,"We stayed here for 2 weeks in June with Thompson. I emailed ahead to confirm: they catered for vegetarians, requesting a quiet, accessible room for a disabled person, and with beds for 3 adults not a camp bed. On arrival at 11pm there was no help with bags though there are a lot of steps. This was difficult as female travellers. We were given a suite which was very nice however it had a camp bed adequate for a child, not an adult for 14 nights. It was also very far from the main areas. It smelt of drains for 4 days and despite telling us someone would sort it out no one did. At the welcome meeting the General Manager, Roche, said people should see him if they had any problem. Negatives Food in the canteen is not labelled and veg/non veg sits side by side, people interchange…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,4,Nice quiet hotel in Agadir Morroco on the beach .,We have just returned from our first trip to Morocco. We arrived late at night but check in was well organised and food and drinks were made available to us in the main restaurant while our bags were delivered to our room. Reception area very nice with interesting sculptures dotted around. We were three adults sharing a ground floor room and although one of us had to sleep on a sofa bed this was fairly comfortable.The room although large could have been designed better. The mirror was a long way from electric socket and there was only three drawers available. The step down from main sleeping area to the sofa/bed area took a bit of getting used to. The air con was not very efficient but there was a good ceiling fan however the room smelled damp so did our clothes ! There was a…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Brilliant Hotel,"We have just returned from a week here and I can honestly say we will return! When we arrived check in was swift and we were told that we could find a cold meal waiting for us in the Fusion Restaurant but, as it was 1.30am all we wanted was our bed - kind though. When we found our room, and it took a while as we were so tired and the Hotel is rather big lol, we were amazed to find that we had been given a suite!! Fantastic to say the least. It must be the first time my friend and I have ever kept a room tidy on holiday, it was too good to mess up. From the lobby to the bars and the restaurants, the pools and the sun beds, all fantastic. The food was outstanding! Not just the choices available but the quality of the foods. And, never really and queues not even at the bars! The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Amazing hotel,"What an amazing hotel, beautiful pool, excellent staff and our room was perfection. All though the usual buffet style food I can not fault it amazing choice and all very good, people don't seem to realise Buffett food can not be served to hot or it will become quickly over cooked. Evening entertainment was not so good but possibly due to all the World Cup games being played and shown due to the many nationality staying there. The other thing is the pool is not easily accessed for any one with mobility probs as you have to use a pool ladder to get onto the water. Management were excellent hear and very hands on and always accessible .

 June 2014,5,Incredible - Can't recommend it highly enough,"We've just got back from an amazing holiday. I honestly cannot describe how brilliant this hotel is. It is immaculate, the staff are so helpful and polite, the rooms are spacious and clean, there was always a manager walking around either the restaurant, pool or reception talking/acknowledging everyone - which is unheard of in most hotels we've stayed in in the past. A lot of people have mentioned in previous review that the food was repetitive, I have to say I disagree. There was so much variety that, if you're not eating everything in one go, you wouldn't have time to get through everything that was on offer. The staff are just lovely, we had our 2 year old son with us and they were so friendly and playful that we didn't need to keep him occupied at all. It was like a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,4,Great holiday in Morocco,"Check-in/ Reception staff: Check-in was very efficient, they ensured both rooms we had booked were next to each other. Checked in around 10pm and told to get a bite to eat and a drink whilst our luggage was delivered to the room, which was welcomed after a long day of travelling. Reception overall were friendly and helpful and could communicate in a variety of languages. Rooms: Very clean, spacious and comfortable. Excellent beds, shower/bath, effective air-con system. Wi-Fi in the rooms would be good so that you can keep in touch with family but then leave your phone etc in the safe. Mini-bar kept well stocked with beer and soft drinks. Some wine may have been a nice addition. Hotel/ lobby areas: Very impressive, spacious and kept very clean. Sometimes very dark in places,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Riu Palace Tikida Agadir,"On first impressions this hotel looks and feels like a top rated place,the staff are very friendly and helpful ,everywhere you go staff are cleaning and tidying the waiters are always there at your table taking drinks orders. The bedroom we had was very spacious with two levels with two beds with a lower area with a couch and a chair then a door opening out to the gardens and then to the vast pool area. This is an all inclusive hotel but you have a choice of local and imported drinks , the good thing is during the day when lying around the pool a drinks trolley is brought round so you don't have to go to the bar as often!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,4,Nice hotel in Agadir,"My and husband and I stayed in this hotel for 11 nights in May. It is exceptionally clean and the rooms were amazing. The food was excellent in the buffet restaurants, although could be a little cold. The al a carte restaurants were a little disappointing but it was a nice change to not have a buffet. The wine was ok and all branded alcohol was available which was good. It was annoying that you couldn't get a bottle of water to drink by the pool as the glasses were quite small. If you are young and want some atmosphere/music at night or round the pool then this probably isn't the place for you. There is evening entertainment and a singer usually in the bar area but nothing after that. In the day other than the aqua aerobics there is no music so it's very quiet. Good for a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,4,Nice Hotel,Stayed here for 2 weeks from the 5th June - 19th June. The flight itself was all ok and on time etc. We arrived late and there was a small buffet for us on arrival so that was nice however we waited over an hour for our luggage to arrive which wasn't great since we didn't get there till after 11pm. The room was really nice and was split on 2 levels. The view from the top floor was lovely and overlooked the pool and beach. The beach at Agadir was ok it is very long and deep and has a 5km promenade. There were no toilets though and no drinks bar so you would have to walk to the pool bar which although is not too far away you would expect there to be one available on the beach. The pool area was very nice however also very busy and you would need to get a bed by 9.30 ish…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We were on ground floor so patio doors opened onto beautifully kept lawned gardens adjacent to pool area. Room cleaned every day. Food excellent although not the widest choice but even so something for everyone. A few well placed tips to a dining room waiter and a bar tender saw us well looked after for the whole time.

Could not fault it. This time however something was slightly different. Check in was disappointing as like many people we had requested a pool view and fourth floor as per our previous stay. We were allocated the shady side of the hotel, tree view and a second floor room. We immediately complained and were reallocated a third floor on the sunny side which was acceptable but not what we had requested. Room: As per other peoples reviews room was of a good standard and with the fridge stocked with beers and soft drinks regularly.

The hotel itself is incredible and in order to give a detailed review, I have broken it into sections below: CHECK IN: I have never witnessed such a swift pleasant check in as this. We arrived off of the coach to welcome drinks (which were amazing) and a short queue away from our room card and towel cards. As we arrived around 11pm we went straight into the buffet where they had laid on some food for us so that we could eat whilst our bags were taken up to our room. This was a complete opposite to the shambles we were subjected to at the Sensatori Sharm. ROOM PROS: It was my wife's 25th birthday so 3 weeks before arrival I requested a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,Amazing holiday! Fantastic hotel!,"I visited this hotel on 5-16 June 2014, it was amazing. We arrived late at night and was greeted with a cocktail which was lovely. The staff really are fantastic, they work extremely hard and deserved every tip they get. Me and my boyfriend didn't tip often but we did tip our waiter every now and then because he aways went above and beyond to look after us. We was given a ground floor room but we requested a pool view and they were more than happy to swap rooms for us the next morning. Rooms are really spacious, I won't go on too much about all the good parts because I really will go on for ages but I am struggling to find something bad to say about this hotel. You get towel cards every day which entitles you to a fresh pool towel every day, just worth mentioning that it wasn't…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Very spacious room with fresh flowers and fruit. Everyday we would have rose petals arranged on our bed. Food was delicious and varied everyday. We had a fantastic waiter who would layout rose petals on our table at every sitting and he never let us run out of wine or water which added to the experience. Some reviews are saying they found it cramped at dinner time, we never found there to be an issue. Yes it was busier at times but always plenty of food available with no queuing.

No one appeared to over indulge themselves with the pretty good alcoholic drinks, although there was a little late night noise.

We recently came back from our honeymoon here and enjoyed every moment. The location a fantastic and is right on the beach. The food was out standing and the staff were so friendly and helpful. We stayed in a suite and it was outstanding. Everyday the staff left rose petal displays on our bed and the room was cleaned thoughly daily. Would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat and highly reccomend to anyone.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The rooms are amazing, spacious, immaculate, we were lucky and had a side view room of the sea and the staff couldn't be more helpful! We didn't tip once and they were still very attentive. I read a few reviews before we went advising that young couples would feel out of place here and it was full of older couples....this is absolutely not the case, it was a complete mixed, if anything more young couples then older ones, perhaps due to the time of year. The food was good for a buffet, always lots of variety and the desserts, for once, were as good as they looked. The rose wine served with dinner was fine, apparently the red wasn't as nice but didn't try it so cannot comment. The hotel…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Also the dining room has been mentioned as being crammed. This is not true and the waiter service so good and variety of food excellent. The rooms are spacious and I recommend the pool facing rooms on ground floor which make it easy to find a good Sun bathing spot. Previous reviews have discussed the problem of guests booking slots early don't worry there will always be a place but you can play the same game, keep pool towels overnight (swap the next day) and find spot before breakfast.

Good bits: Hotel is spotless, good location just yards from the beach, room was spacious and modern, bathroom well equipped. Mini bar in fridge restocked most days and free of charge. Food was varied and never boring. All inclusive drinks were good. Staff were, on the whole, kind and helpful. Didn't have a problem getting a sun lounger and the pools and grounds are a nice place to relax. The two hotel restaurants are worth a visit. Negatives: The view from our balcony (room 2065) was awful, and I mean the worst I have ever had. We were right at the back overlooking the delivery area and the bins, and it stank of rotting food and toilets the whole time we were there.

The room was modern and stunning, if you want poolside view def upgrade in the UK through your travel agent as a lot cheaper. We paid only £14 for our room and people who did not do the upgrade were disappointed to find out that at the hotel it was 40 euros per night for upgrade. The managers would regular come to table and greet people. Best meal I had was at the fusion restaurant, it was like being at a fancy London restaurant. I can not fault this hotel at all.

 June 2014,5,Fantastic!,We are here at the time of writing this. If looking at holidays to Agadir you won't go far wrong with this hotel going by the others we've seen since we've been here. We didn't pay full price so were lucky to get it at the price we did which means it's even more great value for money. It's our first time of All Inclusive so it's taken a bit of getting used to helping ourselves to anything we like all day long but it's been great! We haven't eaten our evening meals here as we like to dine out and get a feel for the area (best restaurant so far is pure passion on the far side of the marina - don't miss this one it's fab!) so can't comment on this but breakfast is nice and staff are very helpful and can't do enough for you.

The grounds and hotel were kept very clean and tidy, and the views whilst walking around are lovely!

 May 2014,5,Not quite a palace but better than you might think.,"We stayed at the Riu Palace for a week from 22nd May. If you read the reviews, you’ll get an idea of the main good points (food, rooms and drinks) and bad (dining room noisy, sunbeds reserved and left empty and the entertainment. When it comes to service, there is no consensus. We’re new to All Inclusive (second holiday) so can’t make comparisons but we were generally happy with the service. At breakfast, a waiter normally appeared as soon as you walked in or soon after and brought drinks to your table. Coffee comes in an insulated stainless steel flask and they’ll get you fruit juices. Plates were cleared quickly and they always offered to get more juice. At lunch and dinner, it was much the same. Sometimes, they left bottles in ice buckets and sometimes they didn’t.

The design of the hotel is stunning, everything is huge and luxurious, the bar/reception area is full of large comfy sofas, the restaurants may be busy but they are so big it doesnt matter. The food is brilliant, lots of choice and much better quality than you'd expect at an AI. We are not big on tipping yet didnt once have an issue with service, the restaurant staff remembered us and what we drank and the bar staff were excellent so it isnt true that people will only look after you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,4,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed for a week here in May and had a lovely week. We had stayed only 6 months earlier in the nearby Riu Tikida Beach hotel and so my review is based on a comparison between the two which I hope helps some people decide. This hotel is very large which has its good and bad points, there is always somewhere to sit and relax and the large grounds are set out well so there are plenty of hideaway spots to sit and sunbathe. The pools are large and never feel too full, but as said before the reserving of sunbeds is a pain. The downside to the size of the hotel is the main dining room which is large, noisy and feels very busy. if you can get a table around the edge of the room or on the terrace this is less so. when we stayed at the smaller Tikida beach the service for drinks…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,4,Not as good as last time,We went to this hotel two years ago when it was first opened and had a really good holiday. We visited again in May and did not find it so good. Nothing I can really put my finger on just think they have taken there mind off the ball. Food was very good but you were sat on top of other people. Very late flights (ours was 1am) and had to be out of room at 11am the day before. We booked an extension but that was only until 5pm and cost an extra £50 which I thought was a bit steep. We then had 5.15hrs to wait around until we were picked up for airport. We enjoyed ourselves and had some good company but doubt we will be going back. PS. Service depends on if you tip or not!!!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful, very friendly but not pushy with anything, lots of French speaking as well as English, was lovely to hear so much effort being made by the staff to communicate with guests.

Grounds and pool area are well maintained although I would have liked to see the area surrounding the pool washed down daily. The food is good and as varied as much as a hotel this size can achieve. It is a pity that there are just too many guests which results in the main dining room becoming like a school canteen with queues and very noisy. The 2 other restaurants are ok but lack atmosphere and the menu does not vary so you can only visit once or twice.

 May 2014,5,"Amazing holiday, thank you!","Just returned from a fabulous family holiday here. The rooms, grounds and facilities are immaculate.

Thank you for such a great holiday.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2014,5,No negatives! I would return.,"We have just returned from a week at this hotel. If you have ever stayed at a Riu palace before you will already no that this hotel is excellent. All the staff are so helpful and friendly. Are room was a standard but with two adults and child staying in there was plenty of room. The room was cleaned daily to a high standard and fridge containing soft drinks and water was refilled. On arrival we were given a room over looking another balcony and no view but a simple request to reception and we moved to a sea view room no problem. The pool area was fantastic, quite busy at times but we never had a problem finding somewhere lovely to sit. I had read some reviews about people reserving sunbeds and this did happen but there was still plenty of space until around 10:00 so you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,Amazing holiday,First of all don't listen to any of the bad reviews we have just arrived home from an amazing holiday could not fault this hotel at all the staff can't do enough for you nothing is a trouble to them with or without tips. Buggy and atlas mountain excursions are a must. Will defiantly be returning in the future.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,A little bit of class,"Whilst we did not like Agadir (having spent two weeks in Marrakech which, in our opinion, is far nicer) the RIU Palace Tikida Agadir was a little slice of heaven. We enjoyed everything from the service, management interaction, buffet style food, two al la carte restaurants (the fusion restaurant being the better of the two) and the entertainment team who worked hard to ensure everyone had a great time. Was it perfect? No. But where there were problems they were quickly sorted and we never left feeling anything but 100% happy with the result. We find being friendly works. Others, who were a little less accommodating, did seem to struggle to get to terms with the pace of life in Agadir... It was hot (very hot at times) but a breeze off the sea was perfect, although at times, that…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,Just fabulous!,"My boyfriend and I spent a week at this fabulous hotel at the end of May. Usually by the end of a holiday I am ready to go home, however I could easily have stayed here another week. We arrived late and were told to leave our bags and check in and go straight for food so that we weren't all starving. Reviewers are correct, the tables are very close together and it does have a 'canteen' feel due to the high ceilings and the echo it produces in such a large room. This wasn't really an issue for us as we ate out for the evening meals after getting some recommendations on places to eat, we also wanted to see a bit of the town. If people are concerned about the tables in the main rooms, we suggest eating on the outside tables. It is much quieter, in fact it is serene, the views…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,4,Our first taste of Morocco,"The hotel was very impressive and the level of service and high standard of food consistently served was very pleasing. The décor throughout was of a very high quality, including the sunbeds! Our only quibble was that the availability of the latter became a source of irritation. The hotel should have enforced its rule on reserving the beds - people were coming out at 7 am or earlier(!) and then not actually using the beds until midday or later, in some instances. One party reserved four places when there were only two in the party! The only other 'criticism' and is purely subjective is that we felt the hotel was a little too big.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,4,Relaxing holiday in top quality hotel,"Difficult to find any fault with this hotel. We enjoyed a 10 night stay, booking through Thomsons, and this represented superb value for money. This was our first visit to Morocco, and also first time in an all-inclusive; food was good quality, and drinks were plentiful - the waiters seemed a little aggrieved that we weren't drinking more than we actually did. Cleaners and gardeners were constantly at work, and seemed to take a real pride in what they were doing. One real positive was the high visibility of the senior management team - speaking with guests and staff, and constantly checking that standards were being maintained. One real annoyance (as mentioned by others) was the early morning reserving of sun beds by many guests, who often only occupied them for a couple of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,A week wasn't long enough.,"First time in Morocco and the best Riu we have been to so far. Asked for 4th floor and got it. Plenty space for clothes,a safe and a mini bar,coke,fanta,sprite and 'Flag' (local) beer all in cans. My husband was very pleased with the beer. The drinks are replaced as you use them.If you are lucky enough to catch them with the trolley they will give you extra for your fridge. Tea,coffee,tubs of milk,still and sparkling water. There is only one in your room but I asked at the bar and they delivered more water. Plenty choice of food you would never go hungry. The tables are very close together which isn't that much of a problem but it can get really busy. Meals were 7-10pm. Maybe two sitting would make it less crowded. Your glasses are topped up as much as you like. We both had…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,Oh My!,"We have just returned after a week's stay at the Riu Palace Tikida. It was absolutely fantastic. As there was a family of 7 travelling, as soon as we checked in, we asked if all three rooms could be together. Due to the late arrival , we were advised to have our dinner and come back to reception. We did this and they gave us all our rooms together on the ground floor, due to the children. It seems like nothing was too hard for the staff to make our stay pleasant. We did get up early to get our chosen beds, however I like to sit by the pool early so this was ok for me. There are many people that simply reserve their sun beds and return to their room but you get this with most resorts. Like I have already said everything was fantastic. We only have too complaints. 1 There…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,4,If all inclusive is for you then Tikida Palace is spot on,"This is the first all inclusive I have experienced. We were a party of six adults and three small children and my wife and I wanted to pay for the family. From this perspective the hotel was perfect. The public rooms and grounds are very good and impeccably maintained, worthy of five stars. Our room a junior suite with a sea view was excellent and much larger than many full suites I have stayed in. This has been the case when I have stayed in Morocco previously. The accommodation consisted of an entrance hall with a wc off, as well as a large separate bathroom with bath, shower area, wc and twin wash basins. There is also a separate walk in wardrobe area with room safe and plenty of hanging space. There was a large sitting room with 27 inch flat screen TV mini bar and patio…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,5,Outstanding,"By far the best hotel I have stayed at. Very clean, food superb, staff friendly and drink on tap. The entertainment was varied and mixed.

The hotel is very clean, reception area very large and a very relaxing place to spend the evening, We found most staff very helpful, but other people staying were complaining about lack of service, we do tip staff early that does help, the bar staff at the pool bar seemed to have no urgency, and preferred to serve the french first, The second week got very crowded round the pool, they did bring out new sun beds, but people were still finding it hard to find somewhere to sit, you have to get up at 6.30 to put towels out, if you want the best beds! The food, plenty of it, and varied, only complaint, some dishes were Luke warm, If you want a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,The perfect all inclusive,"Just about to leave Riu Palace after spending 7 nights from the 19th May , I must say me and my wife really enjoyed our stay. Having read the reviews beforehand and to be honest we both thought this hotel is too good to be true especially with the price etc. The reviews of this hotel are spot on and the hotel is more than worthy of the excellent review.I won't repeat what other people have said but will say that the staff are top quality and always with a smile on their face, not often do we tip but we did several times especially the chambre maids who do a stirling job.The room was spacious and we got a pool side view as requested, cleaned everyday to a high quality.

 April 2014,4,Beautiful Hotel - Lovely Huge Beachfront Junior Suite,"1st time in Agadir, Morocco and we were not disappointed the hotel was lovely, we stayed in a Beach Front Junior Suite which was fabulous only disappointment was you can't order a full English breakfast as room service which was a not what I expected! They Also don't offer wifi in the room but the Manager kindly arranged this for us and for that we were most grateful . We went mid April and it got very cold at night and as the room was so huge we got given a wee heater otherwise we would have been very cold but overall I thought the hotel was good and will definitely return.

 June 2013,5,Spectacular,Visited Agadir last year for the first time with friends and once we entered this hotel we were all speechless. The hotel is amazing!!! From day one the staff were brilliant! Everything about this hotel is stunning! Rooms were immaculate as well as the hotel. Staff always so friendly and service was constantly 100%. The hotel restaurants are amazing and so beautifully designed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Its pure quality and worth every penny!!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Palace fit for a princess,"The tikidi palace is a sumptuous hotel within Agadir. Yes you could say its offers the identikit high polished finish of most Riu hotels however they say the promise is in the details and Tikidi has it in abundance. The layout, materials used, the staffing and the variety of food all adds up to the wonderful experience. I loved the gym, all the pools inside and outside and our bedrooms were luxurious. An minor critique would be the choice of english language channels but who spends the whole holiday watching tv? There is not much going on in the evening but the choice of evening entertainment is sophisticated and classic like the hotel. Mum and I had a wonderful week there and was sad when our holiday ended.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,Magical Morrocco,"We Have just returned from 11 nights at the Riu Palace Tikida, The hotel is amazing, big open spaces and so many places to sit privately. The rooms were spacious, I must admit the storage was not the best, when they designed this hotel it was done well, but definitely by a man!! They look good but instead of utilising the space within the built in units at the side of the bed and where the tv was, they failed as the fronts were just panelled when usually they would be drawers. the wardrobe doors don't open and close easily and you have to fight with them daily, the hanging space for dresses was really bad I am only 5ft3 and all my dresses were at least 6 inches too long to hang. The food is amazing plenty of fresh fruit, a good choice at every sitting. The hotel is a typical…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The thing that sets this hotel off for me is the staff .Everyone on them can not do enough for you the moment you walk through door .Friendly helpful and professional, Without having to tip once even though we would like to. The rooms are perfect for our needs, afterall we only use it to change and sleep. The pool area is very relaxing and even though some people still are towel warriors before breakfast theres still plenty of empty beds avaliable. Im trying very hard to say something negative as I do not think…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,Perfect for a relaxing holiday by the pool,"We stayed here early in 2014 and cannot fault a thing. Great food, wonderful service, clean spacious rooms and lots of places just to 'chill'. The showstopper though is the pool area with its 'cabanas'. We were always able to get one - and there are plenty of sunbeds. Best of all the managers are visible and on hand all the time should you need them If you want to spend a week lying by the pool or relaxing in a bar - this is the place for you.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,4,BEAUTIFUL,"Returned yesterday....not so brown. We were unlucky with the weather!. Everything has been said that can be said about this great hotel. One or two criticisms however. We paid for a twin room but were shown to a double with a beautiful view of sea and gardens(paid for). we were transferred to a twin with no view at all. On an evening when we were fatigued and could not be bothered to go to the restaurant we requested room service which is clearly mentioned online and within the documents and brochures in the room, we were told no room service is available now. I telephoned reception three times to speak to the manager , reception confirmed the manager would call back ..... shame on him we were ignored.For this reason I will not be returning to this hotel.The hotel has a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,5,Holiday to remember,"We were not expecting the hotel to be as beautiful as it is, every nook and cranny has been carefully designed and we never stopped commenting on how stunning the hotel and grounds were. The hotel manager and reps were very friendly, as were reception, bar staff, kitchen and dining staff. Our room was exceptionally spacious and the cleaning and topping up of water and drinks were done efficiently. We really enjoyed the variety of food and drinks and the location of the beach to the hotel was very convenient. There were also ample sun lounges. I could not fault our holiday at all, we were very impressed and look forward to visiting other Riu hotels in the future.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,3,Vegetarians take note,"The Rooms are spacious, with air con, ceiling fan , fridge with beer and soft drinks and tea and coffee making facilities. TV has very limited English speaking channels bbc news,sky news and cnn. The lobby bar and two pool bars are open during the day . With international brands such as Jack Daniels and Bacardi. Tea and coffee are also available as part of the all inclusive package. wifi is available in lobby and around pool , reasonable download speeds as well. The hotel is situated on the sea front with beach loungers available , the two pools are large and one was heated whilst we were here.

 May 2014,5,Review May 2014.,"I booked this hotel for my family and I and were more than impressed with what we found. Where can I start, the accommodation was lovely, the food was good and the staff were more than helpful and loved attending to my baby girl of 5 months. All the excellent reviews are true, yes their are a couple of issues, like they need a couple more staff in the kids club helping out, as for peoples comments about the wine, you just need to ask for them to leave the bottle and they will! We were so impressed we are thinking about re-booking for next year and I don't like going to the same place twice but I can't recommend this hotel enough.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,4,"""If sitting by a pool all day is for you then this is the place""","Visited over new year 2013/4.This was the first time we had stayed in an ""all inclusive"" hotel and we were not sure what to expect as we prefer to explore towns and find nice local restaurants and bars, but as we didn’t fancy an 8 hour flight from UK to further afield for winter sun we opted for Agadir. We thought we only eat in the hotel occasionally and we try the local area how wrong were we, walked down to Agadir town and found nothing worth getting dressed for let alone walking back for. So the hotel was our only choice. The hotel is beautiful, spotlessly clean and the design is modern. Rooms are spacious with a nice big bathroom and balcony and very comfortable. The pool area is fantastic with plenty of bed spaces. The breakfast was OK but we skipped it 3 out 7 because it…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,4,Lovely week outside of Europe.,"Stayed for a week in a Suite towards the beach front of the hotel. Room service was pre-bookable the night before by leaving an order card and very good. Maid service was excellent. The complimentary Safe failed after 3 days and after a call to Reception, a visit 5 minutes later by a Hotel Technician, an engineer from the Safe company repaired it in less than 45 minutes: Excellent. The WC design in the dressing room was wierd, it needed full length solid doors, felt like a wild west salon bar! Service in the hotel lobby bar was good but slow despite lots of staff they just could not cope with demand, but the complimentary almonds, olives and live music kept us busy pre and post dinner; table drinks service was also available. The evening entertainment, live band, live…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,3,"Good, but oh so busy!","I knew what to expect, as it’s a large all inclusive, so I knew it would be busy, kids about and meal times would be buffet style. We paid for the sea facing suite, lovely room, possibly not worth the few hundred quid upgrade price I paid to Thompson, but hey, the rooms were very clean, bed a tad too hard for my liking, but well looked after. However 5 star it is not, I got very cheesed off with the sunbeds all being towelled up at the crack of sparrow! The pool area was large and relatively clean, sorry the same cannot be said of the public loos, yuck. Staff were all great, we didn’t indulge in any tipping and to be fair, the staff changed a lot.

 April 2014,5,Incredible property on a lovely beach,"Before getting to Agadir the reviews I read were pretty mixed. The city was completely re-built since an earthquake in the 1960s thus does not have old Moroccan charm. And there are some large package tour descending on the city. But once there, we discovered a gigantic beach filled with Moroccan's on holiday playing soccer and enjoying themselves. Furthermore, 25-30% of the people at the resort were middle class Moroccans on holiday. In fact, my sons (9 and 12) spent the entire trip playing soccer with Moroccan, British and French children, a great experience. The resort itself is incredibly beautiful and incredibly maintained. Rooms are large and modern with nice up to date bathrooms. The pool area where we spent most of our days was full but never felt overly crowded…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2014,3,2* hotel wrapped up in disguise.,"I am writing this on the penultimate day of my 11 night AI holiday and will keep it short and sweet. The hotel itself has potential to be excellent but it is understaffed terribly which results in bars not staying open and horrendous service. Conveniently most staff don't understand the command of the English language unlessyou happen to cross their palms with money which I believe is inappropriate given the service is quite simply s++t. Italian restaurant not open at all, pool bars close early and you can't have any music by the pool in the day. Its like someone from gods waiting room put all the fun away in a box that you retrieve from the airport when you leave. This is a hotel for the over 60's and boy don't you know it. Oh... And if you want to relax don't come here as…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Great stay,"We stayed here last october, with our three month old baby son. We had a great stay. There are always things that can be better. Like a microwave in the restaurant for warming the bottles. Now it was 'au bain marie' sometimes the bottles were too hot, than too cold... We had a really nice room on the groundfloor at the poolside, very easy with our stroller! Buffet was very good. Krystal restaurant, not that good (buffet was better!)

 April 2014,3,5 Star Building Site,"Stayed here for 2 weeks just before Easter (came home Easter Monday) and although we enjoyed our holiday I can't believe that no one writing reviews for the same period have not mentioned the amount of building work that was taking place. The swim up bar was closed and was being used as a workshop. Work that we noticed included building a canopy by the pool bar nearest the lunch restaurant, putting up a canopy over the lunch restaurant outside seating area, cementing new steps up to the lunch area, building new bases around the fountains, renewing the roof to the pool bar and refurbishing the sun cabins around the pool. We have cpmlained to Thomson as we feel that we should have been prewarned. This was not a cheap holiday! This said, the hotel was spotlessly clean, the rooms…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,3,Not a five star,"It is a real pity because it could be 5 star with a little more attention to detail. As in some of the previous comments I agree that you should not have to tip in advance to receive "" special service"" we are more than happy to tip if we have received a good service but really do object to having to do so just to be acknowledged. In the dining hall I can say without apology that we did not leave one tip, however we did a good tip for the maid and the gardener. The room we had was on the ground floor which looked out on to the pool area. We first thought that this might be noisy but in fact it was not a problem. The rooms are spacious and clean. A tip is to ask at check in for the sunny side, we used a courtesy room to shower before our departure which was on the shady side it…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I can say the hotel it's self is lovely , spacious rooms , very grand lobby as you enter the hotel. The swimming pool area is very large and more than adequate. I have had no single bad experience here there are many things I do not like. The reviews you read say tip early in your stay , well I always visit 5 star hotels and can honestly say I've never had to tip people just for them to do the basic job description . If we go to dinner , the staff will offer you wine , no refill very often unless you tip then you will get the bottle left at your table . Big tip gets you a nice ice bucket too.

I have never stayed in a hotel that was kept so clean. All the polished surfaces were always immaculate and the cleaning seemed to go on all day although very unobtrusively. We stayed in a standard room which was more than ideal with plenty of space and all the facilities one would need. The pool and sunbathing area were huge with ample good quality sun loungers mattresses and parasols, without doubt the best I have ever seen.

It was very good but we were disappointed with some things. We were there Easter time so probably it is classed as low season, even though it was full & the weather usually great at that time of year, so some thing were not available to us and presume it was due to this. The bedroom was a mini suite, fabulous & spacious. Because of the building shape and architecture, we had no sun on the balcony ever - same applied to more than half of the rooms.

The gardens are beautiful. The only downside was the no reserving of sunbeds rule was not enforced. Nevertheless, the lovely poolside staff will find a bed and a corner for you.

Had a very unsettling/frightening transfer from the airport which kind of put a dampener on things and got the holiday off to a bad start. The hotel itself is stunning, the reception is very impressive, our room was huge. It is a very 'French' hotel though. The pool area is a great size so room for everyone without being packed in like sardines. The 'Private' beach is just a small area taped off on the main beach - didn't look inviting at all. The food was excellent, immense choice for breakfast, lunch and evening meal with snacks in between although the Moroccan sections consisted only of 4 dishes, exactly the same day in day out.

Rafael, Assistant Manager arranged a fantastic birthday celebration for one of the group and Hassan, the Thomson Rep was very helpful and very visible. The staff in this hotel could not do enough to make our stay a wonderful experience, and definitely had a sense of humour. The hotel itself is beautiful and the room amply accommodated the three of us. We found the Moroccans very friendly and didn't have any issues with sellers on the promenade or in the shops.

So it was nice to see what this hotel was like, and also how the resort had developed. Firstly the reception area is huge, with plenty of room to sit and a bar that is open from 10am until midnight. One day we were there it rained all day – many people were in this area and it did not feel crowded at all. Off of the reception area is the main restaurant. Free wifi is available in the reception area. Some people have suggested getting a top floor room for the views.

Will definitely be returning in the near future!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,5,Beautiful hotel,"Just back from our second stay here. We think this is a fantastic hotel, great design, use of space, excellent food.....but what makes this a gem of a place is the staff. They are so hard working, friendly and, if you take the effort to get to know them, lovely people. In general we have found Moroccans very friendly, proud people who appreciate tourism to their country. We had a car for the week, which we drove down from Marrakech. Driving is interesting! No worries if you just take care, and the coastal road north out of Agadir is beautiful (after the first 5 miles). A very relaxing hotel opening onto a smashing promenade. We will be back...

 April 2014,4,Good but...,"Had 10 days here in April with ptnr and teenage son. Booked based on reviews which were generally very accurate. Personal comments would be: Positives Loads of public space here and the grounds are very well maintained - always somewhere to ""get away from it"" in little hidden areas Food choice good and plenty of it available - slightly different theme each night but salads fresh and plentiful, pizza really nice and good selection of fresh fish each night. Didn't use the speciality restaurant so can't comment Pool area very nice and lots of sun beds which were comfy Standard rooms genuinely were huge - we didn't pay for pool view but could see the sea instead (not direct view but could clearly see it) Branded drinks available plus local wine drinkable Promenade out the front is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,4,Wonderful week,"Just got back from this lovely hotel ,had a huge room in block 5 which overlooks the beach very comfortable .food and drink very good . Take plenty of layers as can be over cast with wind blowing off sea in the morning ,quite chilly .the local entertainment in lobby good but the animation team too in your face ok for children but not adults ,they also did evening shows which we're very unprofessional apart from the ' river dancer' who was very good . Went with First choice/Thompson very good,did two trips ,half day around agadir ,v good and evening at fantasia ,wouldn't bother went on too long late back. Lots of French folks there . All in all we would go back for a weeks relax",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,5,Amazing hotel! Way beyond expectations,"The hotel was amazing. Room we had was suite overlooking pool but no sunshine which wad only negatve. The lobby area in hotel was so rekaxing and gorgeous we barely spent any time in our room! Drinks and cocktails excellent, much better than other all incs I've stayed at. Staff great apart from girl on reception who tried to do us out of mobey in currency exchange. It got sorted with no fuss but staff knew exactly what was going on like it was organised which was disappointing. Do not go a walk to souk iy is awful. If you don't want to leave hotel this is place for you really couldn't fault food, drink, options, cleanliness and atmosphere",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,5,class!!,"ticked all the boxes. staff, food etc where brilliant. the gardens and pool area was also fantastic. there is no way u cant find sonething to eat here!!! i did find some of the bar staff very standoffish, compared to the waiting staff inthe dinning rooms. i dont know if this was because we didnt tip them but how do u tip if they dont serve you lol. excellent place but not much to do outside of the hotel. one tip if u require a view, even a basic one..avoid room 2067. looks out onto a gate and a few pleasnt security men. head and shoulders above its sister hotel in marrakech! well except for the bullfrogs lol",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,5,Sixth Time At This Hotel,This was our sixth visit to the Riu PalaceTikida Agadir. Staying for three weeks. Everyone was so friendly as always and we were well looked after. The food was first class and could not find any fault with the variety or quality thanks to the very good chefs they have. All the staff are hard working to make sure that your time with them is pleasurable. The Entertainment team put on some good shows and also some nights they bring in outside performers for your enjoyment. Singers in the lobby bar are good and you can have a dance if you want or just sit back and relax with a drink and listen the music. We now treat this hotel as our second home. We will be back in October for another two weeks. Thank you everyone for the best holidays yet.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,5,60th Birthday,"Visited this hotel with Thomson Holidays to celebrate my wife's birthday, with our daughter. The reception was first class, and although we were early were able to use one of the rooms allocated. Luggage was dealt with immediately, and within 10 minutes of arriving we were able to freshen up and go to lunch. The bedrooms were superb with a split level lounge and balcony area. The room was spotless and well appointed with two sinks toilet and bidet and a bath/ shower. The bed was very comfortable and there were outer doors which secluded the two rooms for extra security and noise reduction. The pool area was scrubbed every morning and the two pools were superb. Sunbeds were readily available, although some were towel reserved by guests. The dining areas, food and service were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,5,Lovely getaway,"We stayed here for 2 weeks last June, it was lovely we will definitely be returning in the future! Dinner service is excellent here and the al a carte restaurants were delicious! Nice wine too! Lovely walk along the promenade, just say no to the people selling stuff and walk on they are actually polite, only downfall was it was cloudy a lot of the time. Agadir is a beautiful place we went on a day trip to Marrakech with Thompson it was OK a little tiring as Marrakech is much hotter then Agadir as there is no wind. I'm glad we did this trip as I now know Marrakech would not be somewhere I would like to go on holiday, too busy! Rooms are very clean and we always managed to get sun beds round the pool. The beach was filled with locals which was nice but not very relaxing. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,5,SUPERB!!!,"Just returned from a week at this stunning hotel. Wow. All the good stuff has already been said by previous reviewers so won't go over it ALL again. However... just got to say... our room was gorgeous and we had a fantastic view over the gardens, swimming pools AND the sea! The food at the buffet, and the two speciality restaurants, was excellent. Really we cannot see how people can say there was too little choice and food was bland. They must have had a taste bud transplant! The main problem we had was too much choice and too much delicious food on offer! The hotel design and ambience is absolutely beautiful and everywhere was spotlessly clean. Loved the pools, indoor and out. Loved the gym. Most of all, none of the above would have been worth half as much without the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,5,Stylish and classy,"We have to agree with the majority of reports which say this is wonderful hotel it is stylish and classy both within the the bedrooms, public rooms and around the pools and gardensYou will discover several secluded seating areas if you just wander away from the lovely pool. Pool, Sunbeds are the comfiest we have ever had anywhere and the pool guys will move heaven and earth to find you one if you arrive later in the day.As always you do come across the selfish brigade you leave towels and belongings on beds and don, t return till afternoon We did leave our ebits and pieces early then went for a pre breakfast walk on the prom before settling around 9am and occupied them till 5or 6 oclock which we think is warranted It was very relaxing to sit around the pool as there was NO…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,4,Battle of the sun beds,"This was our third stay at this hotel in just over a year. We like it as it is a short flight from home and on the same time zone. However, although it is advertised as a 5 star please note this is not the equivalent of a 5 star hotel in the UK. Where it scores well is the size of the rooms, facilities including a self contained separate toilet and bathroom, unlike the new pink & purple Riu brand layout, and cleanliness. Where it is more akin to a 3 star is the food. Not a great deal of variety from day to day and quite bland. (That said desserts and fancies are too good). Plus the overall dining experience, which in line with many 'All Inclusive' hotels, is self service cafeteria style. If you know this and accept it then you will be fine. Of course there are the speciality…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2014,5,Great Hotel,"Just returned from a weeks pampering in the Riu Palace. We just wanted to go for a weeks rest and relaxation and found the hotel perfect for this type of holiday. The rooms are large, spotlessly clean and the beds very comfortable. The staff are a credit to the hotel, they were always friendly and made us feel vey welcome. The food was amazing with a huge choice for breakfast lunch and dinner. I would suggest dieting for a week or two before you visit. The hotel has a very informal feel to it without dropping standards. There was a mix of age ranges when we stayed but I would suggest that it perhaps is not so well suited for younger people seeking the club scene. It was a pleasure to stay at the Riu Palace and would put other Riu hotels on any short list for future holidays.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,3,Just ok,We booked this trip on the basis of many excellent reviews on TA but unfortunately we were not as thrilled with our experience as most other reviewers seem to be. We were initially impressed with our large sea facing suite which had a lovely big bathroom and dressing area as well as a large well furnished balcony. But our bed was hard and the room cold. We complained about the lack of heating and were promised an engineer would come and take a look but nobody did. The staff were pleasant but I didn't feel any of them went out of their way for us. We often wandered around the restaurant in search of a table. And we got ticked off for asking to have a sun lounger placed in an off limits area??? The wait for a drink in the bar area was such that we usually gave up and…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,4,Great stay,"I stayed in this hotel with my wife from 21/3-27/3 and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Checkin was quick (not many of us on the bus) and the room was very nice and well specified (very nice shower). The hotel is very very clean. There are 2 outdoor pools, one of which is heated plus a good size indoor pools. The pool staff were always very helpful. I did get in the habit of nabbing a sunbed on the way to breakfast-when in Rome. I did see the pool staff remove towels on a few occassions, but always after noon- so that seems fair enough. Food was very good, but somewhat samey I thought, and is what brings it down from 5 to 4 stars in my review. There is nothing wrong with the food, it is very good and very much of it cooked fresh in front of you-just a bit boring I thought. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,One of the best Riu Hotel,"We have been regular visitors in Riu Palace Tikida for almost 2 years. Great service, friendly staff, excellent location, few meters from the beach, safe with security all over the place. Management is excellent, especially Rafael who is very welcoming and always seen, making sure everything is to perfect condition. Rooms are spacious, food is great, swimming pools clean. We come here about twice a year and feels like coming back home.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Fantastic Hotel,Stayed here in May last year. Stunning hotel and fantastic staff. A La Carte restaurants were great as was the buffet. Rooms are huge. We had a ground floor pool view room which was great. It was quite windy when we went so didn't really head to the beach. Agadir is very nice. The marina is a 30 min walk from the hotel which was worth a visit. Overall a great holiday... (also went to Marrakech on a day trip.. excellent place to visit),Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,5,Fabulous hotel!,"I stayed in this hotel back in August 2013. We stayed for a week and I thought it was utterly fabulous. Our room was on the ground floor and we could easily walk to the swimming pool area. The food and drink was of a high quality. I've stayed in many RIU hotels and this one was one of my favourite. Rooms are clean, fresh and very tidy. I would definitely stay again. Thank you",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,5,Great 5 star,"Another trip to a Riu. Went to morrocco in March 2014 and we were well impressed. The hotel just oozes class as u walk through the lobby. Check in was really quick and desk staff were great, the room we had was lovely and very spacious with the sitting room down a couple of stairs, the staff are really courteous and can't do enough for you especially round the pool. The food is all good and a very good selection especially the cake department. Entertainment was very good and laid back, the drinks at the bars are all major brands and measures are decent, overall this is a great 5 star Riu, will be back.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,4,Lovely hotel,"Spent 7 days at the Riu Tikida Palace from 03 march to 10 march 2014 I was disappointed on arrival at the hotel that there were no porters to bring luggage into the hotel, however they were prompt in delivering to room. The wait to check in was far too long. It would have been better if we had been given the registration forms on the coach from the airport, this surely would speed things up. The rooms are very comfortable and the tea and coffee making facilities were a real plus. I was surprised there was only room service except for breakfast. Also we expected towelling robes in the bathroom and lots of toiletries but there were very few treats The staff are a credit to the hotel, they work very hard to please their guests and succeed in making a positive difference to the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2014,5,WOW Another Amazing Holiday and Amazing Hotel,"WOW where do I start... I have worked in travel for years and it always amazes me when I go to a hotel and have such a good holiday. I have travelled all over the world and have never been to a hotel where everything went to clock work. The team at The Riu Palace Agadir work tireless to service all the guests. I have been lucky enough to have visited many Riu Hotels and class myself as a bit of a Riu Expert. I love the brand and they way they think of every little need. Lets look at some points about the hotel, now I use walking sticks and a wheelchair so I have tailored my review to share my experiences of this. Check In: Fast and very helpful, they will asked you first what language you speak and from there on you are away. The hotel has a large number of French holiday…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,4,Excellent stay at the Riu Palace,"Just returned from a great week at the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir and as a hotel, can thoroughly recommend it. The positives - and there were a lot - as we saw them were: Service Plenty of other people have commented on this - the staff are brilliant in all areas of the hotel. They are all very friendly and accommodating, and the vast majority speak excellent English despite it being a 3rd or 4th language to them. Even the ones who weren't as fluent were still perfectly competent and understandable, so there is no issue with this. You will also receive excellent service even if you don't tip and we certainly didn't see people receive preferential treatment based on them tipping or not. Pool Area There are 2 main outdoor pools of good size, one of which is heated which was a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,5,Relaxing break,Went for a week 6/3/14 lovely hotel staff attentive food good. However there was only 2 restaurants open so bit of a disappointment but buffet was good with plenty of choice. The only thing In the buffet they should label what is vegetarian and use green handles on spoons etc for vegetarian dishes especially with pizza. Would use the chain again and would recommend the hotel. The assistant manager was always available and listened to feedback. Thomson rep was lovely.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2014,3,Arrival needs to be improved but otherwise lovely hotel,"We have just arrived back from a week at this hotel. It was our first holiday travelling with our 7 month old baby and I researched extensively before travelling and read a lot of reviews on trip advisor to help me choose. Overall we had a lovey time - there were just a few things that we felt needed to be improved as they did cast a bit of a downer on the first day! The issue was with check in. So, we arrived at the hotel with 3 cases, a pram and juggling holding a small baby. Noone at the hotel helped us carry our luggage up the flight of marble stairs even though the porters could see we were struggling. We then had to wait 15 mins at reception in the queue to check in (no drinks offered). We had emailed 2 weeks prior to request a 4th floor room so it would be quieter for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2014,4,A lovely place for a winter holiday,"We stayed at the Riu Tikida Palace for three weeks in February 2014. On our last visit to Agadir in 2008 we had watched the site of the Riu Palace start to be developed and we arrived with high hopes. The entrance and reception are impressive and the hotel created a good impression from the moment we walked through the doors. Reception staff were pleasant and helpful. We had upgraded to a pool view room and had been allocated a room facing north. We knew from other reviews that the hotel is horseshoe shaped with the two legs housing the rooms which are at right angles to the beach. Also from previous visits to Agadir that it was best to face south to get all-day sun into the room. We asked to move to a high floor, south facing pool room and changing sides wasn't a problem…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2014,5,"Wonderful hotel, excellent service!","We have just returned from our week at Rui Palace Tikida. Absloutely wonderful break! The reviews are spot on, rooms very clean and spacious, food and drinks are plentiful with excellent choice. The service is outstanding. Comments on tipping are correct, you genuinely feel the staff care, that they love there job and they take pride in looking after you. How ever we did tip, you cannot fault the service and attention to detail. I only wish the hotel had a big tip box at reception that perhaps got shared out to all of the staff. You will feel torn on how many staff go that extra mile. A pleasure to experience and we shall go again. The pool area is spacious and relaxing.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2014,5,One of the best hotels I've visited,"I'm no stranger to visiting hotels and simply this is one of the best ones I've had the pleasure in staying in. Check in went swiftly and given a nice cocktail on arrival. It became very clear that all the staff are so friendly and helpful. Our room 4118 had a view overlooking the pool area. This room was very roomy with a couch, seats and a very big en suite. The room was kept immaculately clean throughout our stay. Top brand names are included on the drinks menu and table service is provided if required. Snacks such as olives and bowls of almond nuts provided. At breakfast, all the waiting staff couldn't be more helpful by providing fresh orange juice, smoothies to your table. At meal times all your drinks are replenished.

We are a family of four with two boys aged 12 and 14 and travel worldwide and have good experience of hotel product. We found this hotel of high quality and the service was excellent, the staff are exceptionally friendly and we got to know a few during our stay. Special mention to Mohammed Adgaz (means butter in English) who was our waiter in the restaurant, he is a credit to the hotel and clearly reflects the culture the management has embedded across their people. Rooms are very good standard, kept very clean by the maids, lounge and pool areas are expansive and pool boys always on hand to help.

 January 2014,5,Excellent hotel second time round!,"We originally stayed at this hotel November 2012 and loved it. We weren't disappointed when we returned for 10 nights at the end of January. The hotel is spotless, the food is excellent and plentiful and the staff are a delight, they can't do enough for you! The only negative comment I could make was the speciality restaurants didn't seem to be of the same standard as they were on our first visit, but the main restaurant is so varied it didn't matter to eat there every night. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody who wants to just relax in the winter sun with relatively short flight time enjoying great food and drink!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2014,5,Fabulous time,"Had a fantastic time at the Tikida Palace and would definitely recommend it, excellent service, food and drink :) The hotel managers were always visible and were there to talk to if you needed anything. My only critique of our holiday was one of the trips which was the day trip to Marrakech, an18 hour round trip. There was a LOT of walking following a guide, probably around 6 hours worth and only an hour to our selves to visit the market by which time we were all rather exhausted. The food on the trip was good, however a lack of loo's made it every uncomfortable if you have a weak bladder. We did advise our Thomson rep, Nita, who was great, about our disappointment of the trip.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Rooms large and spacious and spotlessly clean. The restaurant food was beautiful, amazing choices, fresh and plentiful. The restaurant staff were very attentive and found you a table the moment you walked in, and got your drinks immediately. My only moan was about the wine in the restaurant - it was a bit cheap and cheerful! However there certainly was no shortage of it. Bar service was excellent too, the beer was good and the other drinks all good quality and nicely served. We had good entertainment some nights, suitable for an older audience who liked to dance.

The rooms are really nice, large room, big bathroom, area with sofa down some steps in front of the balcony. Rooms were cleaned every day and were spotless. The hotel facilities are great - huge outdoor pool area, never had a problem getting sunbeds. Indoor pool is a nice bonus, especially for us as a couple of rainy days. There is a good gym that offers some classes. Should have used this more given the amount of food we ate! We both used the spa for a massage, can recommend but book in advance it was busy.

It was just as good if not better than i remembered, the staff made such an effort for my husbands birthday with champagne, rose petals and a cake plus a card from the management. Room was lovely with sea view and my husband was really impressed. The weather in January was better than i hoped, food still lovely.

 February 2014,5,outstanding resort hotel,"This was our first ""all inclusive"" Thomson holiday so we went with some reservations but an open mind. The hotel did not disappoint us at all. We got much more than we ""paid for"" and our reservations were needless. The hotel is large , yes, 700 guests at my guess, but we never felt crowded even in the ""Butlins style"" dining room. We never had to queue for food despite the numbers. The food provided was always freshly prepared, freshly cooked and menus were both eclectic and creative. The patisserie are particularly good. The staff are consistently happy, friendly, supportive and helpful. The managers are always visible and eat with the guests. The rooms are very spacious and always clean.

We do like Morocco but Agadir is not typical, being a purpose built middle market purpose built tourist resort after the devastating earthquake in 1960. It is quite soulless but enjoys a wide, sweeping sandy bay and better winter weather than the Canaries in terms of sunshine and temperature. Being all inclusive you temper your expectations, but there are no issues with the food, rooms or hotel design. The rooms are all effectively junior suites with king size beds, efficient aircon and a comfortable sitting area plus balcony.

It was also the first holiday with a new lady friend, and her expectations of a resort hotel were probably higher than mine, so it was important all round that this was a decent hotel, and standards surpassed our expectations. Especially because we decided to take a week away in February, so couldn't necessarily guarantee the weather, and needed high standards should the weather be poor.

Our expectations were exceeded in all respects from arrival to departure. The choice of food and its quality together with the highly efficient and friendly service was nothing short of exceptional. The comfort and cleanliness of the rooms and their daily cleaning and maintenance was first class. The range of drinks available in the bars and the friendly, efficient service was outstanding. The level of maintenance of public rooms, extensive gardens and pools was immaculate.

We have never done all inclusive before and were apprehensive as we don't like bland food and usually like to try local cuisine. Don't worry as the food is excellent with Moroccan tagines and sides every lunch and evening if you want them. Plus such a variety of foods, sauces and accompaniments to suit all tastes. Everyone we spoke to said this is the best all inclusive they have ever been to and we certainly picked the right one for our first experience. Wine flowed (too much at times) with every meal and, as has been said, international spirits in the bars and served very generously.

 August 2013,5,"great Hotel , on a beach almost 5 star","Was here for a family holiday for 7 days I really have nothing bad to say because there is nothing to say only that there is no wifi in the bedrooms thats all, the food was great the service was great, the all inclusive is wonderfull specially if you intend to stay on the resort all day you get all drinks free not any drinks all branded drinks, you get breakfast, then lunch then afternoon tea break which is really another chance to eat lunch then dinner the entertainment was good the bar service and restaurant service is very good the chambermaids were very nice and did a good job of the rooms, you get 3 resturants to choose from for dinner, two bars in the hotel then two by the pool in the day time its on the beach very busy beach with locals, i would definetly recommend it",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2014,5,A lovely winter get a way with fab service!,"We booked this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Adviser and we were not disappointed. It was a trip away to escape the rain and for my partners birthday. Although we came from the UK we did not book with Thomson or Thomas Cook we booked direct with the hotel. We arrived at the hotel and check in was very smooth with the man at reception taking us all the way to our room and showing us how to get to the pool & where the restaurants were. In our room there was a bottle of champagne - proper French champagne, not cava or other bubbles. We were on the top floor right at the opposite end from the reception and not overlooking the pool so the room was very quiet. It had comfy beds with extra blankets if needed & the bathroom was very nice. The cleaners were at a very high standard…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2014,5,Outstanding service!!,"This hotel was fantastic,1st class service!!! Food was freshly cooked on request and tasted sooo good,cleaners everywhere,rooms spotless and lobbys etc.The staff are very helpful and we were never without a drink, soft or alcoholic....branded drinks too :) The staff bend over backwards to serve you.....brilliant! Would be better if they did not permit trainers or jeans in the restaurant at evening meals. 10/10 for the Riu Palace Tikida!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2014,5,excellent .... true 5*,Room was big clean and full of luxury items. Bar area and restaurants were simply amazing. Even evening shows were good. Grounds pool areas excellent. Staff best I have seen in a long time. This is fantastic.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,You will not be disappointed...fabulous hotel with amazing staff!,"All the Staff are amazing, cannot do enough for you...from reception, domestic, pool, entertainment to restaurant...best ever! One of the cleanest hotel we've ever stayed in. Food - excellent, varied and plentiful. Specialist restaurants are well worth a visit - food is superb with added advantage of being served at your table in a quieter atmosphere. Evenings are relaxed with entertainment available if you want it...some In-house and some professional. Cannot fault and will definitely return...this hotel is perfect for a week of rest, relaxation and being looked after. I don't do long winded reviews...you just need to know you get exceptionally more value for money than you pay for...worth every penny and then some!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,Beat the winter blues!,"We found this gem in January 2013. As the winter became damper and grey I booked a trip and have just returned. We had almost the same room, south facing and quiet. Sheltered from the on shore breeze. We lazed by the pool (heated) most days, and our skins soaked in the warmth and turned golden. The drinks trolley came round at regular intervals so several cocktails were sampled, Mojito being the most refreshing, Merengue also slipped down. The men enjoyed the G&T. The buffet restaurants offered a fantastic selection of traditional Morrocan food, grilled meat and fish, Italian cuisine and a wonderful selection of fresh salad, fruit, cheese, seafood. Desserts were tempting, but petite..so the waistline stayed trim. Full English breakfast, pancakes, croissants and everyone was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2014,4,What do you really need to know?,"OK, so you’ve read these rave views and you’ve made the sensible (and not too difficult) decision to spend a week or two here. Rather than repeating these raves, I thought it would be more useful to give you some tips, based on our experience of a fortnight here in January/February. I hope you find this helpful. ACCOMMODATION If you go for Thomson’s ‘pool view’ upgrade, you may well find (as we did) that you get a double upgrade to a large, superior pool-view room. Ours was really a junior suite, with a large corner balcony facing two ways, with views of the pool, sea and the Kasbah (castle) on the hill. It had a seating area with sofa, table and chairs, dressing room and a bath as well as shower. In other words, the supplement was money well spent. The hotel is U-shaped…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,Best ever,"We came to this hotel after being upgraded after a problem where we were previously staying. This has to be the best hotel I have ever been to. The surroundings are fabulous, the staff are brilliant and can't do enough for you. Our split level room with balcony and all amenities was sumptuous and the food was superb with loads of choice-we certainly came back heavier than we went!!!!! Definitely going back and that is something we rarely do. Absolutely brilliant",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,A Treat for a week...,"We stayed at the Riu Palace for one week as a treat after new year 2nd to 9th of January. Booked the hotel as familiar with Riu hotel chain and was not disappointed. 5 Star.. We were met by lovely staff on reception, room was ready and waiting for us. We had a super room on the 3rd floor side sea view, had sun on our balcony all day. The weather was cool in the morning but was soon very nice and warm up around 11.am. Of course will be getting better as the months go by.. Very safe a lovely long stroll to be had either left or right on the front promenade all one level nice under foot for older ones. Lovely private beach to the front of the hotel. We went to Agadir on our first ever holiday together 30 years ago, and decided to return. It was a lovely break very much enjoyed it.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,Superb Winter Sun Break,"We have just returned after a week break to celebrate my birthday and what a holiday, I cannot fault this hotel from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. The staff are great from the reception to the gardeners, they always have time for a chat and a smile, anytime of the day. Where shall I start, the thing closest to my heart, food and drink. Every meal was a delight, there is something for everyone at every meal, cooked lovely and the choices are superb, I especially loved the individual little pastries and biscuits which were available lunch and dinner, I am blaming them for my weight gain, the pastry chef is wonderful!!!!

 November 2013,5,Very Relaxing,"We stayed her in January 2013 & were wowed upon arrival after driving from the airport through the busy industrial areas of agadir by the most beautifully presented hotel. literally an Oasis in the desert. we were not disappointed by the level of service cleanliness and politeness by all members of staff, even the room maids were bonjour & bon-soiring all week long. The variety of food throughout the day was as astonishing as the number of different bed dressing arrangements that were carried out to bed runners every day. Amazing how our mess spilled over every day yet returned to room later with not a hint of us ever having been there before - as if we were new guests. Great service by everybody from the pool man to the Top man.We had such a nice time, we went back to the same…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,5,An Excellent Hotel 5 Star Luxury,"Stayed here in November 2013, The hotel was immaculate, the staff fantastic and the food was second to none. Our room was beautiful, spacious, cleaned every and flowers and fruit left for us as it was our anniversary. The assistant manager Rafael was visible every day and ensured all guests needs were catered for. The hotel staff were professional and friendly and would go out of their way to ensure your stay was a memorable one. The beach is on the doorstep and is beautiful and clean and it is a lovely flat walk to the marina. We have previously been impressed by Hotel Riu Palmeraie in Marrakech and returned several times but the hotel Riu Tikida Agadir is now a firm favourite, we have re booked for June. This hotel will take some beating !!!!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,4,Beautiful hotel!,"Me and my partner stayed here for a week on August 2013 until the first week of September. The hotel is absolutely stunning and definitely 5 star quality! The hotel is exceptionally clean and tidy and is definitely worth staying at! After reading a few negative reviews prior to my holiday I was abit worried about the staff being unfriendly and Agadir beach being dirty. However, the staff were completely welcoming and so friendly! I have witnessed alot of tourist talking down to them showing and showing them no manners so of course they may not be as kind to arrogant snobby tourists! Just say please and thank you it isn't difficult! The staff were all so lovely and kind, I ensured I tipped them if I felt they went that extra mile! As for Agadir beach, it was probably the only…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2014,4,Excellent value,"This was our umpteenth visit to a Riu, but our first to a Riu Palace. The rave reviews are justified. There was little difference between the cost of the 3 Rius in Agadir, (Thomson) but the sheer size of the palace made it worthwhile. The bedroom (basic) was fabulous. I can only imagine what the suites are like. We had a big room, with 2 steps down to a large sitting area with settee (extra bed) table and chairs, then the balcony of similar size with table and chairs. At the corridor end the room opened into a dressing area with wardrobes, safe, kettle and fridge, then double doors into a bathroom, and doors off that to loo / bidet. I won't merely repeat other reviews, the place is great. My only criticism is of the restaurants. The Moroccan is a bit of a waste of time. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,"Were treated like Royalty, AMAZING!!","We spent the last week of January here, weather was beautiful but not as beautiful as the hotel. First words to come out of my mouth were WOW. The entrance and reception area was welcoming and spacious. Check in was very quick and as we checked in at lunchtime our room was ready for us and luggage was delivered to our door 10 mins after check in. Rooms are spacious with a lounge area leading onto a balcony which was lovely as we had the sun from sunrise to sunset (rooms on the left as you look out to the sea) you dont look out over the pool but i would prefer a sunny balcony! And it was also nice watching the locals walk by the outside of the hotel. Food is all cooked freshly infront of you and never had any problems with any of the food. Waiters will leave your wine on the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,Top class for an AI hotel,"This was our second visit to the RIU Tikida Palace and we were just as pleased with our holiday experience this time. There are many excellent reviews here on Tripadvisor so, rather than going over the same ground, I thought I would give a few tips for anyone who has already made up their mind to holiday at this lovely hotel. CHECK IN: The entrance to the hotel is very grand with several flights of marble steps leading up from the road. Assuming you are travelling with Thomson’s the coach will take you as near as possible to the entrance doors but there are still a few steps to negotiate. If (like us) you are no longer young and don’t fancy dragging your bags up the steps look out for a porter who will happily do it for you. A tip isn’t expected but will be very gratefully…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Superb,"Went for a week at Christmas 2013. Cannot find fault anywhere with this hotel. Service was superb, food and drink was terrific. Staff were excellent. I walked the promenade most days (it's about 4 miles long clean tidy and safe) and this was easily the best hotel along the promenade. There isn't much to do in the resort of Agadir, however if you are looking for a week in the winter sun where you can chill out and receive excellent service then this is definitely the place. Will go back next year.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,4,GOOD MANAGED RESORT.,"A good managed resort. POSITIVE: - Friendly and smooth service (reception, restaurants, bars) - Large, spacious rooms wich are daily cleaned - Free internet at the room. Free WIFI in the bar and lounge - Direct access to the beach - Large swimming pools. 1 pool is heated. - Tasty and varied food (not always hot) - Good animation at night - Few Easteuropeans - Bar with good brands - Casg dispenser near the reception. NEGATIVE: - Noisy main restaurant - Room isolation can be much better - Not suitable for children or young people. -",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2014,4,Really good hotel but a few niggles which could be fixed easily,"Just returned from a week's holiday (9-16 Jan) and enjoyed our stay (so don't worry if you've already booked it and are reading reviews now !). I'll keep it brief because all the the reviews we've read seem to be pretty accurate assessments of the hotel and service. Firstly, we have stayed in 5 star all-inclusive (AI) RIUs in Mexico and the Dominican (as well as 4 star AI hotels elsewhere) and this one really does have the look and feel of a 5 star hotel in the AI world. It never ceases to amaze us that some people expect these places to be similar to the likes of the Savoy, Ritz, Dorchester, etc., when they cost a fraction of 5 star hotels in the UK ? If this is going to be your first experience of an AI hotel, you'll probably find that others you'll try will be a let-down…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,Hotel fit for Royalty,"An excellent hotel situated in beautiful grounds. Spacious well decorated rooms and superb gourmet food. Plentiful free drinks,of the branded variety if you wish although the wine was Moroccan only and not to my palate. Staff generally helpful and attentive though reception staff not up to standard with many having poor English.Indeed roughly 80 percent of the guests were French so French comes in handy! Entertainment poor (generally supplied by youthful activity team) but we tended to avoid this. Helpful management, always visible.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2014,5,Fabulous hotel,"This was the first time we had stayed in an ""all inclusive"" hotel and we were not sure what to expect, particulalrly as this was a large hotel with over 450 rooms. The hotel and holiday exceeded all our expectations in every aspect. This is a luxurious and well maintained hotel with lovely gardens and elegant public spaces which provide lots of secluded corners should you wish peace and quiet. Our pool facing bedroom (on two levels) was very spacious and well appointed with a huge bed, separate sitting area with sofa and chairs, plenty of storage space, good bathroom with lovely rain shower, separate toilet and large balcony with chairs, etc. Although we had a couple of minor problems with a malfunctioing safe and blocked bidet these were solved within 10 minutes. As other…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,5,Fantastic Holiday,"From the moment that you arrive, until you leave the hotel the staff make you feel welcome and nothing is to much (a coupe of the bar staff can be forgetful). The hotel is five star without question, although there are a few things that would lift it to another level when comparing to other five start hotels. The decor of the hotel is very classy and warm. The rooms are absolutely fantastic and very spacious, we had a standard room with pool view but was the size of many suites we have stayed in before. The rooms are very clean, always kept that way and the maids always were like ninja's in the way they achieved it while not being seen. As an all-inclusive, the food can sometimes be a bit samey. Not at the Riu Palace where the food is excellent, with many dishes cooked…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,4,New Year Break,"We have stayed at the Riu Palace during May this year and September last year so we decided to try New Years Eve there. We travelled on Boxing Day and returned home on the 6th of January, We had a fantastic time, weather was blue skies and sun every day during our stay, Staff were brilliant and worked very hard and the gala dinner on New Years Eve was lovely, the tables were laid out beautifully. The main bar stayed open till 2am every night. We did fine the entertainment boring on most nights could have done with a good group on New Years Eve. We will be going back same time for new years eve this year. Would like to thank all staff for a fantastic holiday.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,Better than expected stay,"This is a Hotel where 1st impressions are not fantastic but after settling in it grows into a place you would want to return too. The lobby is a lovely spacious area which has a very good ambience in the evening. The corridors are less inviting though the rooms are spacious and well appointed. There are some annoying little problems which have been there from build such as drawers in the wardrobe which don't open properly because of the sliding doors, probably the reason why many of the doors are propped up outside of rooms, fridge door hits the rail for the door slider and so on. The shower was very good. Outside the garden is good and the pool areas have different spots to suit different choices. The bar areas are good. There are two small boules court at the rear. Easy…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Best hotel in Agadir,"I stayed at the Riu Tikida Palace with my wife and the effort made by the hotel and it's staff really was 5 star, (and that is from someone who has stayed at both The Dorchester and Grosvenor House in London in the 90,s). The hotel is absolutely immaculate. All the staff are so helpful from maid, bar, reception to management. The food was good, but obviously not top UK restaurant quality, but probably the best you will get in an all-inclusive in Agadir. You cannot fault the chefs for their efforts. The problem isn't so much the choice, but the quality of meat products which are not comparable to that of the UK. Nonetheless, I would score the food 3 out of 5 if I was comparing it to a top UK hotel. The evening Riu entertainment is absolutely terrible. The animation team do…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,5,Amazing Hotel!,"This hotel surpassed our expectations! The staff were friendly, helpful and professional..nothing was too much trouble. The standard of the rooms was excellent; spacious, very clean and stylish. We were impressed that a safe was available in our room at no extra cost, and a free mini bar constantly replenished. The food was of a high standard, and the two themed restaurants were a real treat! The two pools were beautiful; one was heated. Plenty of sun beds with mattresses and free pool towels. All In all, this was the best hotel we have ever stayed in and would have no hesitation recommending it to others!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2013,5,The best hotel I've ever stayed at,"Can't believe how late I am with this review, but all in all this is the best hotel I've ever stayed at and I could not fault it. It was a family holiday and we had two rooms, the rooms are beautiful, well decorated and huge. They are cleaned regularly and very safe. The pool is so big! One downside was we had to get up early to reserve sunbeds which is a bit annoying, they need to reinforce the sunbed rule. The beach is just next to the hotel and really nice, lots of sunbeds. The staff are amazing, a true credit to the hotel, they speak so many languages and are always willing to help. We loved Hamada the aqua aerobics instructor! As a family of vegetarians we had a great choice of food, and on nights where there wasn't much for us to eat the kitchen prepared us our own meal…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2013,4,Perfect winter break,"We went to Riu Palace Tikida Agadir in the beginning of december. Weather was realy nice that week, we were very lucky! The hotel is close to the beach and city, everything is in walking distance. Staff is wonderful, polite and very friendly. The lobby is very grand. Cosy but a little bit dark decorated. The rooms are huge and well laid out. Very clean. Big, good shower, a little bit dark in the shower but that’s in almost al the Riu hotels. The decoration in the hotel en rooms is rather dark. The hotel is only 2 years old, I think, but it feels a little worn already. There were 2 wardrobe doors missing (they were standing in the hallway just outside our room) and we had 3 broken lights in our room. We asked for a poolview but did not get it and got a room on the outside. 2…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,2nd Excellent visit in 2013,"We first stayed end of Apr/May ( see review) and enjoyed it that much decided to return for Christmas (19-26Dec). we e-mailed requesting the same or similar room as before (we had a pool view) and was not disappointed when we got our request, but in hindsight, as one review says, we should have asked for a south facing room as the sun is on the balconies all day, which is a bonus when it starts to get a little cool around 5pm, as opposed to wanting shade at that hour back in April (but the error was all ours). Not much to say further about the hotel/staff but to reiterate again, Excellent, wouldn't have gone back if there had been any issues. The Xmas celebrations were just enough without going overboard, a gala buffet dinner on Xmas Eve as most Europeans do, then life back to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,4,Good tourist class hotel,"I'm not going to wax lyrical about the hotel, its facilities or rooms as plenty others have already done so. We were there for new year and enjoyed it though the main bar and restaurants are cavernous, so when the hotel is fully booked it gets rather noisy and feels a bit industrialised. To compensate that the staff work amazing hard and bring in that touch of a more personalised service. These people cannot be faulted at any level and must be congratulated for what they do. We liked the two a la carte restaurants, Moroccan and Italian fusion, though they can get really busy, so booking is best. As others have said food can get a bit samey and sometimes is not always hot, though the range cannot be faulted. Even in a week we felt the need to get out and popped across the road to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,One of three Thompson hotels in Agadir,"We have stayed at the riu tikada hotel the previous year.rooms were larger, as they should be for the extra money compared to the other Riu hotel. We were a little disappointed with the food as it did not appear to be of the same high standard. Either we were blasé , or they are cutting back as we expected better,. The speciality restaurants are well worth booking , and please leave a tip for the good service. We had wifi in the room ad we were near to the reception, and when we asked for a ground floor room we were given one with a small grassed area- Well worth having, and the traffic going past was minimal. There was a heated pool outside, which was good as in October the unheated pool was bracing! If you are front England, book with Thompsons at one of their Riu hotels…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Great Hotel,"I was at the hotel in December 2013. The hotel is located close to the beach and local amenities. It is still fairly new having just been built a few years ago. It is well kept and the staff do a good job in making it clean and tidy at all times. The room is well laid out with a living room, spacious bathroom area and ample wardrobes. The room is cleaned and the mini bar replenished daily. I will recommend the pool / sea view rooms on a high floor as they have a better view. There are 4 restaurants at the hotel. There is a buffet restaurant which serves breakfast and dinner. There is also a restaurant close to the beach area that serves lunch. The other 2 restaurants are a la cartes serving Moroccan and Continental dishes. These restaurants needs to be booked in advance. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2014,3,Noise spoilt otherwise great hotel,"As the title suggests my husband & I found no peace & quiet in the rooms. We were woken early between 7.30-8.30 with the cleaners moving furniture around other rooms to clean. Not necessary to do this every day. We were in room 2133 which was near the end of a long corridor on that floor but found everything echoed, Noisy inconsiderate french & arab holiday makers. So pleased to say never heard british voices!!!! Great to say. You could hear your amarous neighbours, so we could only join them!! Apart from the noise everything else was very good. Food fresh & plenty of choice. Friendly staff Great Location. Enjoyed Agadir & the people more than other similar destinations, i,e, Egypt, Gambia, Turkey & Tunisia. Lovely clean hotel just too noisy for our liking,",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Perfect break ❤️,"Such a gorgeous hotel, the staff really cannot do enough to make you feel welcome. It was our first holiday to Morocco and we would definitely return to this hotel. The standard rooms are very well equipped with high spec bathroom fixtures and a shower to die for. You are able to order breakfast in your room if you wish, however we chose to either go to the main breakfast buffet or wait until lunch. The food choice and quality was amazing, the best we have experienced at an AI hotel so far and constantly replenished and hot. Named brand alcohol is available at all times and the waiter service is on hand as soon as you arrive.

 December 2013,5,Maybe it's time to break a resolution,"We rarely ever return to a hotel ... it's just not the same the second time round ... but that golden rule may just have to be broken. We visited the Tikida Palace from December 19-26 and what a great experience. The hotel is perfection ... rooms, food and staff hit all the right spots. The rooms are huge and well appointed, there is a vast selection of food and the staff from the manager down are ready to help at every opportunity. We were at the hotel for Xmas and did not really know what to expect, but lots of thought went into providing an excellent celebration. There was a gala dinner with delightfully decorated tables and the guests were welcomed into the restaurant by a line-up of all the catering staff and waiters. Special mention must go to our favourite waiter Hassan,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Gem of Agadir,"Firstly let me start by saying I have been to many all inclusives including the Mexico and I'm reviewing this hotel in isolation based on value for money and location. We had a wonderful holiday in the RIU Palace. The lobby area is grand and really creates a good atmosphere. Our room was comfortable and spacious & the cleaners did a great job every day. The breakfast was our favourite meal with eggs , pastries and so much more to choose from. I celebrated my Birthday while we were here and the Morrocon restaraunt made it so special with a bottle of champagne and even a personalised dessert. Do not come to this hotel if you need to be entertained, the bar is closed at 12 on the button and the evening entertainment is nothing to write home about but this is not a big deal for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,Just Awesome!,"Stayed here in September with my partner. Every aspect of the holiday was incredible. The room was huge, the balcony was peaceful and private and the pool area was busy but not crowded. The restaurant staff are the very best I've ever encountered, remembering drinks and names. The bar staff in the small outside bar just off the piano bar are really friendly, too, and the bar is a great place to chill out without feeling that you're on display.

 December 2013,5,Highly Recommended,"We’ve just returned from a truly relaxing and luxurious 10d break at this fantastic property. Very fortunate to receive a very generous upgrade to a sea facing 3rd floor suite the views we had of the pool and the beach were magnificent. Our room extremely spacious, very modern, well maintained probably had the best showers and most comfortable mattresses we’ve ever experienced. The resort is 18months old, always impeccably clean and very well designed with a very large stylish lobby. There is the odd sign of some wear and tear though only a matter of time before this will be fixed given the hard working nature of the staff – more on them later. Though we enjoyed the design of the hotel a lot, there were times in the evening when more light in the dining areas may have helped a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,4,Ticks most of the right boxes,"While we were in Agadir for business, this was my time at an all inclusive (including alcoholic beverages!). Stayed for a week with colleagues - we booked in advance and got a terrific deal. Food is generally good with a wide international/Moroccan selection, the service is what it should be. Restaurant closes at 10pm which I thought was a bit early. The lobby bar is supposed to close at midnight but generally the staff are kind enough to keep it open later. The reception staff were very helpful and went the extra mile to make up for not having a business centre. Standard rooms are more like junior suites in terms of size and furniture, but do not have 'work desks'. In the room there is only wired internet by LAN cable and is perfectly acceptable in terms of speed, but WIFI…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,4,Gorgeous!,"There is only one reason why I personally would not return here and that is due to the entertainment. Although there were daily day time activities such as aqua gym it only actually went ahead twice during the week we were there. The evening ent was not really any better; the team don't seem like professional dancers they are out of sync with each other. The bar singer was ok but was unprofessional I felt as he was reading the words from his ipad for some of the songs! The reception team could have been more efficient; a lot of staff on but not all serving and only one can exchange money so you had to wait for that member of staff which sometimes took a while - train all staff in cash handling!

I went on the recommendation from a friend who had her honeymoon there the year before and it wasnt even fully completed and she raved about it, so we thought why not. It was the best 10 days of our lives! The staff are amazing and the Manager was so nice. Nothing was too much trouble. Drinks flowed (for my husband as I was 22 weeks pregnant) the food was plentiful and every day it was different which we found impressive. We had dinner at the Fusion restaurant it was delicious but left hungry. The buffet was so good lunch time beer and wine unlimited. The cocktails were lush. Even the non alcoholic ones. We are actually booked to come again this summer but in late June as it wasnt hot enough and the outdoor…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Fabulous stay but not without faults,"We stayed early December 2013 for 2 weeks. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted to a welcome drink as we checked in. As our room was not ready, we were invited to go for a drink and return to reception after one hour. We returned and the room was ready and our cases promptly delivered. First impressions of the room were fantastic, the room being very modern and spacious. Oversized twin beds with steps down to a lounge area leading to the balcony which overlooked the road. Off the main room was the wardrobe area leading to the bathroom which had his and hers sinks, a bath / shower and the toilet / bidet was also separate. The room has a safe, tea and coffee making facilities and a hair drier which can be found in the bathroom. On unpacking and checking the room we…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 December 2013,5,First visit to Morocco,It was our first visit to Morocco and our first all inclusive holiday. To say the least I was a bit apprehensive. I needn't have been. The hotel was absolutely fantastic. On arrival we went to book in at reception and was given a sticker with our room number on to put on our luggage. The porter was most helpful as my husband is disabled he said to me that we were a long walk away and it was probably not easy for my husband. I went to have a look and found out that he porter was correct. I went back to reception and explained the problem and they moved us to another room straight away. The room was brilliant. We had a view of the pool and the rooms was very spacious. The service in the restaurant at breakfast and evening meal was great they were more than helpful. …,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Excellent winter break,"My boyfriend and I returned home yesterday after an enjoyable week at the Riu Tikida Palace. The hotel is lovely and modern. We were impressed with the size/decor of the room and view across the pool and beach. We paid a little extra for this but it's definitely worth doing. Amazing rainforest style shower and good sized bath tub. The only negatives were that the bed was a bit hard and there didn't seem to be any heating in the room, so it did get a bit cold at night - bring something warm to sleep in. The pool area is beautiful and very relaxing. No problem getting a sun bed at any time of day although we did visit during a quiet time of year. Good pool side bar and waiters will come around frequently to ask if you would like anything, which is nice. Service overall across…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We thoroughly enjoyed the holiday and the food and accommodation were excellent. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet with everything needed including tea and coffee making facilities and mini bar. The main buffet restaurant was quite large and the quality of food, variety and availability was superb. The local Moroccan wines served were surprisingly good and plentiful! The speciality restaurants were most enjoyable and we ate in these seven times during our stay. The buffet restaurant near the beach was excellent for lunch and we ate outside on all but one day. The pool areas were spotless and the swimming pools were good with plenty of…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Fabulous Experience Again,"Returned again, for a second visit early December, having been very impressed on our previous first visit same time last year. Again very impressed in all aspects of the hotel. Rooms faultless, food fabulous and drinks very reasonable quality ( international brands) . Specialist restaurants well worth visiting and evening entertainment of very high quality although poorly attended, which was a pity. Ideal position for meandering along the promenade and watching life. Boules (pétanque) area and excellent competition 11am and 4pm each day for those interested.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,Flawless,"My partner and I were in the Palace Tikida Agadir for 11 nights in late September and we both agree it was the best holiday we've been on and that says a lot as we're both well travelled. We were literally wowed by the place when we walked through the doors, the lobby and bar area is spacious and relaxing. Check in was a doddle, we asked to take our own luggage to the room as we heard it takes awhile for the porters to get round to everyone's rooms. The food was delicious, so much variety in the buffet, however fussy you are with food you'll definitely find a selection of things you like I promise you that. Book yourselves into the speciality restaurants on your first night as they do fill up very quickly. The Krystal Restaurant is something special, great food, great…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Excellent staff and beautiful rooms!,"We've just returned from ten days at the Riu Tikida Palace (9th - 19th Dec) and overall it was an excellent stay. We were in a sea view suite (room 3003) and the room was beautifully decorated with a spacious lounge area, super king size bed, separate bathroom and toilet and a sizeable dressing area. There was also a huge terrace with chairs, a table and sun loungers - everything we could ask for. The decoration is very modern and stylish, with muted neutral tones and marble in the bathrooms. There was a separate bath and a wonderful rain shower with good water pressure. Robes were also offered which was a nice touch. If you're willing to pay extra for the suites, the premium is worth it for the views alone and the extra space. I would recommend the 4th floor, as this avoids…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2013,5,Exceeded our expectations!,"We booked a last minute holiday through Thomson at an incredible price. We were going to book the Dunas but friends who had stayed at the Palace earlier persuaded us to stay here instead. What good advice!! We have never entertained holidaying in Morocco but wanted some winter sun near to the UK. It turned into one of the most enjoyable holidays we have had! There is nothing we could complain about! Everything from the hotel itself, the staff, the room, the food and drink were outstanding. I have to say that we never tipped until the end of our stay but we still received an incredible level of service. Our table was set and drinks poured and ready for us when we went to dinner!

I can honestly say what an amazing holiday it's been! This was my first holiday away, on my own - so wanted to do things differently and sure I did that! Although I've spent majority of the week away on adventures and excursions, the hotel still deserves a review at least. I arrived at the hotel and was instantly greeted with warm, welcoming faces and a cheeky cocktail to kick start the holiday. After checking in, it was a huge disappointment to hear that my hotel room won't be ready until about 15:00pm - considering I had arrived at the hotel for around 12:30pm.

Staff - wonderful. Found reception very helpful and friendly, bar staff excellent and cheerful and waiters could not do enough for you. We have to mention Tarik, who was the very best we encountered, always remembering our drinks and just enough time for a quick chat and to make you feel you were getting 'individual' service. Cleaners worked endlessly and always greeted you with a 'Bonjour'. Rooms - very spacious and clean. Yes, the beds are firm but I prefer a firm matress and they were HUGE twins so plenty of space!

Wife and friends I went with thought a little chilly in the evenings, but I was just a dress shirt and was more than comfortable. Probably the cleanest, best kept hotel I have been to and thoroughly deserves the 5 star rating it has. Rooms perfect, food was excellent (buffet or a la carte) and staff were absolutely superb.

 February 2013,4,Great place for winter sun,"Stayed here early this year. The hotel was new and very clean. The rooms were big and well finished. The food was ok, some of the themed restaurants lacked a bit of atmosphere, but overall it was above average for an all inclusive hotel. The other facilities were good, with a reasonably equipped gym to work off some of the overindulgence that an all inclusive typically encourages! Agadir as a resort is ok. I managed to play 3 rounds of golf on the varied courses that the city (not connected to the hotel) has to offer and if you play I would recommend taking your clubs. I will return here for some winter sun/golf",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our room was a nice place to go back to at the end of the day, again wonderfully clean and with a fridge that gets refilled every day. The staff are very friendly but naturally they give extra attention to those who tip them or have banter with them, or both. So, if you want to get the very best out of your stay here, smile, chat, laugh and be a little generous. Champagne breakfast every day, if that's your thing.

The hotel has a large reception area, very grand, nicely decorated but for some reason is very dark. Reception on the whole were helpful but definitely got the impression french speakers got better attention and service. Rooms were adequate size and tastefully decorated, mini bar was replenished every other day. We did however have a most unremarkable view of a car park from our balcony. Food in the hotel was a disappointment, repetitive and frequently luke warm which was probably a contributing factor to both my partner and I getting a stomach bug.

For some reason the British only get a glass of wine with their food, the French get a whole bottle! It took us a day or two to realise that not all staff can speak/understand English and so when we spoke to them in French we got a better quality of service. Obviously we don't expect or demand that other countries residents speak English but as a Thomson/TUI Group hotel we would have expected front of house staff to at least be able to converse in their area of work.

His chat was amusing the first time round but lost something on a repeat performance on the return trip to the airport. The transfer time was approx 1 hour. The hotel is extremely pleasant, it is very new and so there was little (but not nothing) wrong with the fabric or fixtures and fittings of the building and the large spacious reception area gives a nice idea of what to expect elsewhere.

Whilst the food is standard buffet fare, there is a hint of Moroccan cuisine with a different tagine each mealtime. Basically the food will cater to all.

It has a grand reception with gorgeous decor and bar. At this bar they have some live music, we saw a guy singing karaoke style and some percussionists.

The bedrooms were of a good size but the beds are very hard - the holiday rep offered to arrange for a soft 'topper' to be put on the bed but this turned out to be just another quilt which made little or know difference. The biggest complaint is the restaurants - none of which I would recommend - the main buffet restaurant is buffet style and all the precooked food was only just warm, seating is in rows unless you arrive as soon as the restaurant opens and are lucky enough to get one of the few tables for 2.

They also left large bottles off water in the room every day and even diet coke on our request.

Best for us the quality and variety of the buffet food, always piping hot, cooked I guess in frequent small batches, along with a smiling and efficient waiter table service. Faultless!

 December 2012,5,Simply amazing,"We stayed here in April . Me my girl friend plus parents. The trip was for my fathers 60th birthday and it was simply amazing, Even though the hotel was recently opened everything was immaculate. The decor around the hotel and the rooms were fantastic. The food was very very nice with lots of choice. The themed restaurants are a must. The drink and cocktails all top shelf and as nice as you'll taste. We loved the entertainment team and the shows were very good. All staff were very friendly. One of the Riu directors Raphael was over seeing the opening and he was brilliant not scared to get his hands dirty and serve drinks and was always asking how we were and if we were enjoying our stay. The hotel made a real fuss of my father on his birthday and we can not thank them enough for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,5,Wonderful 5 Star,what a wonderful weeks break at the Riu Palace. Food excellent staff could not do enough for you ! Rooms clean spacious and as described and pictured by Thompson . Hotel is immaculate and very very clean.Went sand buggy racing you must do it great fun! Marrakesh is a must as well its a long day but well worth it amazing Drinks all brands available cocktails coffee was fab as well The people who have given this hotel a bad review must have stayed with the queen and eaten in Michelin starred restaurants! We couldn't find fault at all Its worth every penny paid !,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,4,Very nice hotel with a few things needed,"We have just returned from the fabulous hotel and is like to say from the off; I'd return tomorrow. First impressions: Fantastic. As you walk through the doors, the whole hotel greets you with a very grand reception. With a little fountain, marbled flooring and very clean. Impressions were good. Rooms: Fantastic. My partner and I nearly always pay extra to upgrade but the room we we're put in (4143) was huge, clean, 32"" TV, very comfortable bed, a small seating area and a balcony overlooking the sea. The bathroom was big with a separate room with the toilet. Pool: The pool area is very nice, very clean and lots of beds. As you can probably see from pictures and previous reviews, there are wooden beds, and an almost tent like bed with a step into the pool. We had no issues…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,4,Great Escape,"Returned yesterday 11th November from 7 night break. A great escape from the British weather We stayed at the Palce at this time last year and returned to find that the feedback from last year has been taken on board making our stay even more enjoyable. Smoking is no longer permitted in the bar and foyer area making preprandial drinks all the more enjoyable. The staff have clearly benefitted from another 12 months experience and service is much sharper and slicker than it was. As always a small tip at the beginning of the holiday takes the service to another level. The problem then becomes one of limiting the top up to your wine glass. The restaurant buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner offer a wide choice with a large proportion of dishes cooked in full view. Plenty of fresh…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Really enjoyable stay,"My hustand and I stayed end of April / beginning of May for a week here. The hotel was lovely - we often upgrade our room but hadn't done so here but were not disappointed. The room was huge. When we booked in we asked for a room with a pool view as we had read the reviews and these sounded the best rooms but we were given a room on the outside of the hotel. They did say if we didn't like the room to tell them the next day. There was a large bathroom with a double sink, large shower and separate toilet that led on to the bedroom with a lovely big bed. After that was a couple of steps down into a living area and then the balcony - we even had a sea view and it was lovely just watching people going up and down the promenade. We certainly weren't disappointed and the made…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,"Two weeks of sheer luxury, excellent food, beautiful hotel and attentive staff.","We have stayed at this beautiful hotel twice now and have not been disappointed. There is a huge choice of food which is professionally presented and is of a very high standard. Food is on offer at pretty much any time of the day! The hotel room was large, clean and contemporary. Great power shower, his and hers basins and a bidet. The maid service was excellent and little finishing touches with rose petals etc made it very special. The gardens are immaculate and not a weed to be found anywhere. The grounds are clean and rubbish free too. Hotel staff are very attentive and can not do enough.......always with a smile. The management are always at hand if you should need them or just to have a friendly chat to. A thoroughly wonderful holiday and we shall return again if only to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,2nd time and still no complaints,"We visited this hotel in April this year and had such a good time we decided to treat ourselves to another cheeky week laying in the sun being waited on. The flight out was on time and we arrived at the hotel mid morning, which was great we checked in with no fuss and our room was ready so off we went to get unpacked and down to the pool. The room was simply fantastic, we were on outside of the hotel i.e, not overlooking the pool but to be honest that didn't matter at, it was interesting to watch the world go by on the walk way that we overlooked. Our room was made up for 3 people, but we still had loads of space. The rooms are cleaned really well each day, we had clean towels every day, and the bedding was changed twice. There was one day when they didn't leave us any tea…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,5,Loved it !!,"Perfect for a quick escape from the winter gales at home in the UK. No sooner had we departed Manchester Airport - we were arriving at this stunning hotel. The main reception captures everything you can say about this place ... spacious, elegant, high quality ... it really oozes class !! Staff friendly and attentive, room was gorgeous, and facilities were superb ... All in all I'd say that the hotel is well and truly brilliant !! I would rate the food as a 9/10 (would have been 10/10 if I'd not had a couple of luke warm efforts), and drinks / bar choice as 10/10 ... Animation team were great - though not as in your face as in other RIUs... though I put this down to the hotel being designated as a 'palace'.

 October 2013,5,EXCEPTIONAL HOLIDAY.,We have just returned from a two week holiday which was one of our best holidays ever. We went for my wife's birthday and everything I planned went like clockwork. Everyone in the hotel makes you feel special and welcome. I would not like to name any person by name as all the staff work very hard and are so attentive . The hotel is immaculate throughout and the food is well presented and of a very high standard. This is now our winter destination and looking forward to going back on the 2nd. Dec for another two weeks..,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,5,Fantastic !!,"We've just got back from 7 days at the Riu Palace, 2 adults and a 5 year old. No complaints at all. Cleanliness: Immaculate, inside and out. Rooms cleaned every day, to a high standard. Pool area beautiful. Entrance very impressive, all good. Rooms: Quite big, bathroom is a decent size with great power shower. One tip (from the Mrs) if you take your GHD and want to do your hair in front of a mirror, take a 2 meter extension cable as the nearest plug socket is about 2 meters away from the mirror. The socket in the bathroom has very low power (razors only). Food: Amazing, and very tasty. Loads to choose from (in the buffets), same stuff every day but there's such a big variety. Tip: The Moroccan food cooked in the tagines is delicious. We tried the Marrakech restaurant (get the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,a place for all,"hotel in general was very good, reception helpful although spoken English could do with improvement. The welcome meeting was informative and was attended by the hotel manager who also gave information and tips, first time we have known that to happen. Restaurant was top notch, breakfast covered all tastes, even champagne! Lunch was in a different location close to the pool and beach again all tastes catered for. Dinner was back in the main restaurant and again could not fault the food in any way. The staff throughout the hotel were helpful, polite and happy, always ready to do anything that helped to make your stay that bit better from the run of the mill holiday. The facilities were really good everything was sparkling clean, the gardens were beautifull and there were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,5,Absolutely amazing...!,"A phenomenal hotel from the staff to the food everything is outstanding. The hotel is exceptionally clean in every department. Lovely restaurants and bedrooms. If you're looking for class, luxory and elegance this is the hotel. The only disadvantage is the four poster sunbeds need to be reserved early hours if wanted.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2013,5,Fabulous fabulous fabulous,"Great room, amazing(!!!!) food and fantastic service. Brilliant hotel, definitely come here if heading to Agadir! So impressed so far. Bars shut at 12 and pool shuts at 6pm but more than enough to do elsewhere in hotel and never feels overcrowded. Also nice mix of people - not an all English resort at all, very refreshing from previous holidays in euro resorts when younger! Weather has been good, and rep (Thomson) was very helpful. Off to Marrakech tomorrow on the day trip and everything has been sorted for early breakfast etc. Fab fab fab.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,4,Relaxing holidays!,"We have stayed in the hotel for a week between 2nd - 10th of October 2013. The weather was nice, usually around 28-30 degree (C), cloudy in the morning- up to midday then proper sun afterwards. Rooms are kept well, cleaned every day, however the smell of toilets welcomed us on the way in. Its nothing to do wth the cleanliness- just drainage smell.Foods was nice, especially Morrocan Restaurant - it was the best!We did few excurssions with Thomson- first was the Argan Massage- it was good, however would not do it again. Second excursion was buggy adventure- would recommended to anyone! loads of fun, if you like thing like that, make sure you put the worse clothes on , as you will get mega covered with sand.

 October 2013,5,Hotel Riu Palace Tikida :- An Overview,"We stayed here for one week following four nights at the Riu Palmeriae as part of a twin centre break.Those of you who are interested can find my review for that hotel on the relevant page. The 'Palace' is rated as a 5* hotel and this is mostly justified if one takes into account the overall experience rather than solely relying on the facilities because there are a few niggles. The first impression of the Palace is favourable with a vestibule area that is vast and cathedral like.The reception desk is mainly staffed by the Riu equivalent of 'MUSE' ... Lots of females who are all friendly,competent and well versed in witty repartee; such a pleasant culture shock after the male dominated hotels of Egypt and Tunisia. Check-in is quick and painless but remember to ask for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,So good 1st time had to return,Returned to this hotel 10 days in September as enjoyed it so much last year (Sep 2012) and was not disappointed! The management are always on hand looking for feedback and some little improvements had been made. Staff very friendly and always got good service. Branded drinks and food fantastic - also loved the fizzy at breakfast! Hotel is on the promenade and we had lots of walks along the beach. Lots of street sellers but a 'no thanks' is all that is required. Would return again,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Fantastic Tan,"We arrived about midnight and were welcomed with a drink and very easy check in, the restaurant was open for a cold buffet whilst our bags were taken to our room. Although cloudy in the morning it was still hot and as I said my tan is fab so don't let that put you off, so what if you reserve your sun bed everyone does it and you do what you can to get the one you want but after saying that there were always plenty of empty ones around the pool. Food and service was great the waiters couldn't have been better, the manager introduced himself and was always around day & night. The rooms were lovely with a bigger bathroom than we have at home! Our mini bar was re-stocked everyday ( guess we we're the lucky ones? ) the whole hotel was absolutely spotless with the lobby beautifully…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,4,A solid hotel with a few niggles.,"We have just returned from a week here through Thomson. The hotel itself is immaculately kept and is aesthetically stunning. The lobby, ground and rooms are spotless. The hotel is much bigger then we anticipated however the service was never compromised. The food is varied, tasty and hot. The restaurant service is on the whole exceptional and staff were very friendly. There are a few things however that let this hotel down and they are things you wouldn't perhaps expect from a Riu Palace Hotel. The air conditioning in the rooms is regulated by the management-and is quite poor. Although it's cooler in October the air conditioning isn't good in the rooms and is more like a fan system which doesn't keep the temperature down. We had a few nights where it was very warm in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,3,Disapointing and not relaxing at all.,"After I booked this hotel, I was having second thoughs and even wanted to cancel my trip but then I read all the positive reviews and decided to go. Well, my mistake. To me this hotel is just ok but certainly not more. Let's say I did not get this ""vacation feeling "" arriving there. You don't feel you are in a sunny place since it is very dark a minute you put your feet inside. It is dark in the lobby, dark in the rooms ( although they are big and clean) and dark in the main restaurant. You wonder if you are going for breakfest or dinner.... Couldn't tell because of the lack of day light and dark wooden decoration. In the evening, not many lights around the pool area as well.... The main retaurant is very noisy!!! Can't have a conversation there. The food selection is ok,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Pure relaxation,"Hotel aimed at relaxation and did exactly this!! Lots of food to choose from throughout the day including pizza and spag Bol for those fussy eaters. Waiters very attentive making sure drinks are always topped up. There are 2 special dining restaurants (included in all inclusive) which are worth the visit. All inclusive drinks where known brands such as martini, dissorano, becardi etc.... Never had any problems finding any sun loungers! Room was very clean and had everything you need in it (including the mini bar which is also included in the all inclusive package) Prices of the spa facilities where reasonable. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and feel really relaxed!!! Hope to return again soon!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,5 STAR Plus,"We have just returned after a two week stay at this beautiful Hotel, it certainly lived up to our expectations. We had a junior suite on the first floor overlooking the beach which was absolutely amazing, and the best room we have ever had, the mattresses are a little on the firm side but it depends on personal choice. Spotlessly clean in fact the whole Hotel and grounds were to a very high standard. The food was the best we have had in any Riu Hotel and the service was impeccable. Our waiter Yassine was lovely and had our drinks ready as soon as he saw us approaching. The staff are just so well trained it was a pleasure to watch them. Dinner was served from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the Le Santal Restaurant and men MUST wear long trousers there is a very strict dress code…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Amazing (ignore the negative comments),We wanted a October holiday and we didn't know where to go and by accident we clicked on morocco and found the Tikida Palace. Before booking we looked at trip advisor and saw different reviews good and bad. As there wasn't huge amounts of choice we decided to book. Three of us travelled all female the only downside we had to fly from Gatwick and we live in Derbyshire. The flight was only three and half hours It was very hot we had the odd cloudy day but even when cloudy it was hot and the sun would burn through by midday Don't worry about money we panicked about this as you are not allowed to take money in or out of the country. When you arrive you can change your money at the airport we arrived in the early hours and they were still open. In the hotel they had a exchange…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,A Superb Autumn Break!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our week at the Riu Palace. From the moment we set foot in the hotel we felt the relaxed and friendly atmosphere. A nice touch was access to the restaurant after a late arrival. The rooms were spacious, well-designed and spotless - all floor areas being wet-cleaned every day. The common areas in the hotel and the grounds are all beautifully designed and well maintained. Although there were some who selfishly reserved the 'prime' spots there were always plenty of seating options around the pools. We particularly liked the 'quiet' seating areas amongst the water features - a great place to read a book with a drink in hand! The beach is fantastic - just a few steps across the promenade from the hotel - just kick off your shoes and you can walk for miles. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,3,Not the best Riu we've stayed at,"Stayed at the Palace in July. While the room and the facilities were very nice we were disappointed with the food, particularly the 'al a carte' restaurants. The other main gripe was that the table tennis room was never opened on time and they never seemed to care we had been waiting over an hour to use it but the gym opposite was open all hours! Overall a distinctly average stay, expected more from a palace.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Definitely 5 star,"We stayed here for a relaxing week at the start of October. If you're looking for a relaxing all inclusive holiday, then you can't go wrong here. The room was clean, spacious, and of a high standard. The food was varied and delicious. The drinks were of good quality, and the service friendly and efficient. The activities and entertainment were there if you wanted them, without them being forced upon you. We could not fault the hotel at all.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,5,Fantastic Riu Hotel!,"We stayed in the Riu Palace Tikida for a week in June and must say, it was way up there with all the Riu Hotels. We arrived very late and were given drinks and a cold buffet - a very nice touch! Our room was amazing - one of the biggest we've stayed in - with a sea view and mini-bar with beer, water and pop. The hotel was just superb - plenty of sunbeds with cushions and even a waiter with a trolley and drinks! We used the buffet restaurant by the beach and the main restaurant and the food was fantastic, didn't try the speciality restaurants as we were happy to eat in the buffet restaurants. All the staff were very pleasant. The hotel is right on the beach and it is a nice walk in either direction - you do not get bothered at all. We would definitely recommend this hotel and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Late Autumn Break,This is our first experience of an all inclusive holiday and we cannot fault it. We stayed at the Palace and on arrival following a 30 minute coach transfer were greeted with a mocktail whilst check-in only took a few minutes. The main restaurant was kept open even though we did not arrive until 11pm and a wide range of food was made available. Our room over looked the pool on the top floor which is what we requested via email some weeks before. The room was immaculate and very spacious. Only problem was a fault of our own and that was to let a Mozzi in before going to bed. Breakfast was our first experience of the masses but it is a very large restaurant with many very helpful members of staff. The great food continued throughout our week stay where we ate at the Moroccan and…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,First Class,"This truly is a 5 star hotel. We were thoroughly spoiled and didn't experience anything negative that past guests seem to have experienced! Youseff in the main dining room was very pleasant and helpful. All the waiters and waitresses in the other restuarants were very attentive. Bar staff too were faultless! The only very teeny very tiny fault was in the spa, I went for two treatments and got the same girl who sighed and yawned throughout both times! We did go for an argan oil massage away from the hotel and that was very basic but very worthwhile and relaxing! We also took a trip to the Atlas Mountains which was well worth it! Our guide Achmed was so funny and so informative, please sign up for this trip if you can! So if you are thinking about the Riu palace (not Riu garden)…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Two centre holiday with Thomsons Marrakesh and Agadir,"Just back fro this wonderful holiday it was a two centre holiday by Thomsons well worth every penny. First hotel was the Riu Tikida Palmeraie, which was just outside Marrakesh, it only too 15 minutes to get into the city, we done two organised trips with Thomsons to the old town by day and then one by night, we also rode in a horse and carriage on the evening trip well worth the money. The second hotel was the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida Agadir which was a 3 and a half hour away in a luxury coach beautiful scenery, we had one stop on the way . The hotel room was excellent one of the best rooms we have stayed in. It was directly on a very big sandy beach. One downside was we had to go back to Marrakesh airport which meant doing the 3+ hour trip back again, would have been better…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Outstanding service,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our two weeks at this fantastic hotel. Our room was clean and spacious although we would have preferred the safe to have been on the next shelf and the fridge door was a tad fiddly to open. The grounds are well manicured,look out for the tortoise which wanders around the hotel. We always managed to obtain a sunbed. The food was plentiful, varied and the cakes were to die for. The Asian theme night in the buffet was of an excellent standard (as good as any Chinese restaurant ) We enjoyed the Moroccan a la carte and the Fusion a la carte food was very good but perhaps the portions were rather on the large size! The service from the staff was second to none, a special mention must go to Amal our breakfast waitress, Soufiane our evening waiter in…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,quality accomodation,"cracking hotel in a good location. rooms are very spacious and to a high standard. food is very good and the staff are very efficient. the pool area is always kept clean and although busy with our continental friends there is always beds available. the beach is wonderful and the sea was lovely and warm, but strangely not many people used it. the only real downside was the entertainment, it was poor to say the least. but overall a lovely hotel in a nice area!!!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,5,Fantastic Accomodation,"This hotel's standard rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable. Be sure to try and get a room on Level 1, preferably one of rooms 114-124. The best loungebeds by the pool are the ones on the same side as the kids club. That way, you can decide whether you want the sun on you or shade from it. The towel hut opens at 8am but I would get your bed by 7.30am to get your 1st choice. The beach is right there and you can walk along it for a lovely evening's stroll. Exit the back (pool side) onto the promenade/beach and hit a right. You will be walking towards where all the main restaurants are. The staff are friendly and the hotel is large, clean and not too far from the airport.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2013,5,Great Holiday,"This was my first visit to the hotel and Agadir and have to say I would probably return . The hotel was very nice, we were situated on the same level as reception, and although the view from the room wasn't great ,the size of the room more than made up for it , it was clean, spacious. Shame they didn't provide shower slippers and bathrobes like most 5 star hotels do. The staff are very nice especially in the restaurants. I celebrated my birthday there and was very impressed with the little note , gift and bottle of champagne so thank you . My only gripe was , you couldn't get a decent sun bed. I did wonder if the pool boys were tipped to put towels out so early........ going for a early morning jog I counted about 2 to 3 beds with no towels on....................still there was…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,4,Not quite 5 star,"We have just returned from 2 weeks at this hotel. We had a good time. The hotel is lovely but in need of a few improvements. The rooms do have aircon but it is limited by the management so some nights we found it very hot and stuffy to sleep. There are no drawers in the room despite being plenty of room for them, so out stuff was shoved into the bottom of the wardrobe. It has been mentioned before about tipping, do NOT tip the pool staff. I am very sorry to say we did but he took the money and he was never seen again, we took our chances and always got a comfy bed. The beds are quite dirty and stained so cover with a towel. Tipping is also rife in the canteen, not a resturant as the tables are all shoved together with no gap between the tables, at times we waited ages for drinks…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,3,"Beautiful Hotel, Good Experience, Areas Needing Improvement, Upset Stomachs","It was a difficult decision as to whether to go for a 3 or 4 rating for this hotel - we're half way between the two. This is a beautiful property, the moment you arrive in the huge lobby it's got the ""wow"" factor. Arriving at around 11pm, the check in process was slick and efficient, with guests tagging their own luggage with their room numbers for delivery later. The restaurant was open for light snacks at this time. Sadly our bags took a further two hours to arrive at our room. The rooms don't disappoint, they're simply, but stylishly decorated with large and comfortable beds, mini bar (stocked every other day) flat screen TV (they even have BBC1 and BBC2 for UK visitors) and lovely bathroom (with a large shower rather than a bathtub). Rooms also have a good sized…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2013,3,Not quite what i was hoping for,"First impressions were good, our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the pool and we were very pleased with the size. Huge bed (two pushed together), flat screen TV (which you can connect a USB device to), seating area, large balcony where we could get wifi signal from, two sets of wardrobes (only 10 coat hangers so you may want to take some extras), large bathroom with an amazing shower and a fridge stocked with soft drinks and beer. My only issue with our room was that the air con blew the air straight into an alcove about 30cm in front of it so the air was not circulated around the room. I did not have one full night’s sleep all holiday because of noise or heat. We stayed for 14 nights from 19/09 - 03/10 and went with Thomson.

 September 2013,5,No complaints,"Just returned from an 11 night stay here. Had a really nice stay. Our first stay in Morocco but our 11th stay at a Riu. Arrived late morning,went to the bar for a drink as room not quite ready. Had a lovely room 4012, on fourth floor with sea view,pool view and a lovely sunny balcony for most of the day. Found all areas of hotel to be spotless. All members of staff where nice and pleasant. A special mention to Massi in the restaurant who looked after us, he could not be faulted. Service with a smile every day. Also Omar in the lobby bar. What a star. We did not tip all the time. But found some people to be quite rude and abrupt to staff. There is no need for this.

 September 2013,4,Great place if you like big hotels - but very considerate service.,"We had been traveling around Morocco for several weeks and staying in small riads, so it was a bit of a shock to find ourselves in a hotel this big. Initially, I was a little put off with its size. It took us about 5 minutes to walk to our room from reception. However, it was clean and comfortable. Unfortunately my wife took ill in the lunch restaurant, and the advantages of a large hotel were demonstrated. At least three guests who were Doctors appeared along with two nurses. The Manager - Raphael - appeared and took charge and showed genuine concern and helped us enormously. We are indebted to him and other guests who helped. Most of our stay was interrupted by medical matters, so we were unable to experience much of Agadir.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2013,5,Amazing holiday,"First time we have stayed in a Riu Palace and will definitely do so again. Excellent check in on arrival and a very good cold Buffet was laid on which we were not expecting as we arrived around 11pm. Room was very clean and shower was powerful. Mini bar was more than adequate with soft drinks and beer, regularly stocked although just call reception if you need more water. All this is included in the price. Staff went out of their way to be helpful especially Shadba who could not do enough for us in the main restaurant. Hot or cold plates at each meal were available and the food choice and flavour was excellent. Pools never too busy and aqua fit popular although if you were not interested there was another pool or the indoor pool which was very warm. We did the Thomson half…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,Just enjoy and relax,"I can only agree with previous comments, that this new hotel (only been opened for just over a year) is well laid out both from a public & private room basis, with all area's being kept spotlessly clean. There is something for everybody depending on what you want, either sports or leisure facilities. The variety of food was great and I cannot imagine anyone not being able to find something to eat and enjoy in any of the restaurants. We did not have an issue getting wooden sun loungers or an umbrella, even going down after breakfast, with the staff around the pool offering a friendly, cheerful service (especially the girl who distributed the beach towels). My wife and I did have a couple of highlights, firstly we had a Turkish bath, scrub & massage at the spa, which took over 1…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,2,Great staff but it should not be called a Riu palace,"I need to start by explaining the score. The hotel sells itself as a palace. As much as this is a well kept and well laid out hotel its facilities do not set it as a palace. Its lack of restaurants, room facilities and entertainment activities (no tennis, water sports, archery etc) set it behind its counterparts. We have been to other Riu's not described as a palace which have more facilities. You will see many other glowing reviews and these are representative of peoples experience but a Riu palace is supposed to be the flagship of this brand and as nice as this hotel is, that description does not fit and as such does not manage expectations. Good points: • Excellent rooms • Superb staff • Plenty of sun beds • Good size pool • Easy access to the promenade if you like a walk…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 October 2013,4,Beautiful but a few niggles,"I've struggled a bit with this review as the grounds, hotel, staff and location definitely warrant five stars but there are a few issues that make it fall short of that elusive status. Most people have commented on the good but the best thing about the hotel is the staff, they are incredible. They go out of their way to speak to you, even the gardeners and maids who generally have little interaction with the guests. The gardens are beautiful and I know it's a small thing but the grass is beautiful and it's obvious a lot of work goes into the care of it. The food was lovely, I especially enjoyed the themed restaurant, Krystal. Although two things to be wary of, one - the soup on the appetisers plate is genuinely vile, I think it's blended toasted bread, tomato and water. Two -…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,Excellent hotel but room for improvement,"This was our first visit to a Riu hotel and we were very impressed, the lobby is huge and there was plenty of room. The rooms are all junior suites and huge only slight niggle is that we had twin beds rather than double although they were pushed together, loved the his and hers sinks. The rooms were always well cleaned every day and fridge appeared to be stocked every day with water soft drinks and beer. The food in the main restaurant was excellent and varied always plenty of salad and always a roast on plus pizza for those who don't like to try different foods. There were always a selection of local dishes and as you would expect in Morocco loads of fish dishes it was nice to see that there was always lots of varies vegetables as well. There were was always a good range…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,4,Fabulous rooms,"We were wowed by the rooms in this hotel, spacious comfortable and spotlessly clean. The food was superb though plates were often cold for the hot food and with such a large dining room by the time you reached your table dinner was luke warm. We could not fault any of the facilities and entertainment but in spite of its 5 star rating I have to say we enjoyed the 4 star Tikida Garden in Marrakech ( which we have stayed in twice) more, the friendly and exceptional service there is a hard act to follow. I would not want anyone to be deterred from booking this hotel because it is sheer luxury, just to point out thats it not necessarily luxury that makes a memorable holiday.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,4,Great hotel but minor things keep it at 4 star not 5,"This is Riu's highest rated hotel in Agadir and it is a great hotel that offers a fantastic all inclusive holiday with promised sun shine but there a several small things that unfortunately can't be over looked that easily make it a 4 star not 5 star hotel. I will start with the positives and there are a lot more of these than negatives: -rooms are of a very good size with large bathrooms with his and her sinks and amazing showers -hotel and rooms are spotless and very well kept -majority of staff are very polite and friendly who actually engage you in conversation which is nice -food is of a very good standard for an all inclusive, you can't and won't get amazing food at an all inclusive catering for 600 people all day but here the variety is good and there is always something…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,4,"very good hotel, but some issues","Having spent an excellent week at this hotel in January, we returned in September for a fortnight and the experience was slightly less good. With the exception of the over warm main dining room and lobby area, the facilities were still great and very impressive. Rooms are excellent, spacious, airy and well equipped and the overall building design and finish is of the highest standard. The staff are friendly and generally very helpful but here is a problem with a reliance on regular tipping to get top class service and there is also a reluctance to maintain dress codes and standards of behaviour amongst guests. It may be that discounting has been responsible for a change in what was a stylish and calm atmosphere, but it should be possible to reconcile an all inclusive offer with…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,Look no further.,"Just stay here! Top hotel, you really cannot fault it. Stayed here for a week from 26th Sept, impressive from the moment you arrive into the stunning lobby, handed and drink and check-in was a breeze. The room was spacious and cleaned thoroughly every day, the bed was huge and walls solid. Ok yes we did hear some noise from the chairs above being moved around, but it wasn’t a big issue. The food was excellent, huge variety every night – all fresh/tasty, and clearly a lot of effort had gone into little things like the deserts. They have 2 restaurants you can book into (do this ASAP upon arriving) – both we beautifully decorated and the service & food was excellent – I just found it a real shame that there were empty tables (despite being fully booked), people must reserve…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The main reception/bar/lobby area is so cosy and comfy. The rooms are big and feel like you have lots of space, we had a double bed that was like a super king size bed was really comfy and had a great nights sleep every night. there's a separate seating area with a little table and chairs and a sofa and coffee table which is nice as you don't feel like you are always in the bed area. the balcony again is a good size with two really comfy big chairs and a table.

 October 2013,4,3rd and last visit,"As this was our 3rd trip back to this hotel, perhaps the rose-coloured glasses have been removed for us? As a girlie holiday it ticks the boxes - easy flights, sunshine, all-inclusive and good hotel standards, however we did notice that this trip seemed to be made up of rules and regulations that were only enforced when the management saw fit: Pros: Rooms were beautiful as always and the standard of cleanliness is perfection. I think the A/C isnt as powerful as it should be - perhaps they turn it off in the day? Food was as good as it could get for an all-inclusive (and Ive done Mexico so I think Im fit to judge!) thats such a short flight away. Weather is still wonderful - can be cloudy in the morning but that soon burns off to give bright and HOT sunshine! Cons: It has…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,5,Paradise... and food heaven!,"I could not have been more pleased with our hotel in Agadir. The room was beautifully furnished, spotlessly clean, well equipped and spacious. The bar area was comfortable and again very well furnished and inviting. The pool area was like a paradise. The restaurant served the widest array of food I've ever experienced in an all-inclusive. The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. Excellent! A word of advice - the beach is in Morocco, therefore locals are Moroccan and not used to seeing semi-naked female bodies. If you want to sunbathe in a bikini, don't be surprised if you get a few looks because it's unusual for them to see. But you will be completely safe. Also, people will come up to you to sell you things - just say no thank you (politely but confidently) and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Greeted by reception staff and quickly checked in, left luggage and went straight into restaurant which had been kept open for us as we didn't arrive til midnight. We were immediately made to feel comfortable. When we went to our room we were more than pleased, sea view and enough room for a family even though there was only the 2 of us. All week staff were constantly polite and eager to get you anything you wished for, nothing was too much trouble. Everyone we spoke to we more than pleased with their holiday experience and all had either been before or would return.

 August 2013,5,Probably the best in Agadir,"We stayed there for a week in late August and enjoyed every minute of it. First, I'd like to praise the service, the staff is really and sincerely friendly, they're eager to help you with any wish even when it's beyond their duty. The pool guys are excellent, they're ready to help you even at 7am (in case you want to reserve some sun beds, which is weird but it's a real problem to get a good sunbed after 8 am), before the pool actually starts working, you don't have to look for them, they'll volunteer for help. The waiters are very quick and smart and again eager to help. The rooms are spacious, well kept and clean. The territory is well cared for, the grass is greener on their side))). We had a pool view room and never regretted paying extra for the view. So I'd recommend…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Check in staff were very efficient, and were very friendly and pleasant, we were directed to our room where our cases were already waiting for us. The rooms were very clean and spacious, and the balcony was a good size too. The rooms were cleaned and maintained every day throughout our stay. There was never any issue finding sun loungers. The double sunloungers that are right by the water are fantastic. There were always staff around asking if you wanted another drink, and there were activities such as water aerobics and vollyball that you could do. Both indoor and outdoors pools were lovely, the pool bar was not…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our first trip to Morocco & we were very impressed, hotel could easily complete with those we've stayed at in the Caribbean. Email requests were answered promptly by reception prior to our stay. From the moment we checked in we were greeted with a warm welcome and nothing was ever too much trouble. We were given a room upgrade to a suit that was better than the room we had just left at the Sofitel at Heathrow, and that was nice! Reception, animation, bar & catering staff all went out of their way to make our stay memorable.

The hotel is spotless, the rooms spacious, and the staff always greet you with a smile, our thanks to Fatima, Nora, Yassine and many others who made this stay so memorable. Our thanks also to Thomsons rep. Melissa, and Hassan, who went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed every day of our holiday.

 September 2013,4,Lovely relaxing holiday. Recommended!,"Stayed for 6 nights at the beginning of September. Booked direct with hotel and booked flights separately - considered going with Thomsons but the dates they flew out didn't work for us, plus it worked out a little more expensive. We paid approx £141 per night. Please find below my very detailed review! We are a couple in our mid twenties/early thirties who wanted a relaxing holiday where we didn't have to stress about anything. Some of the comments about the very old clientele worried me as I didn't know if everything would be aimed at a much older market. However this was completely untrue, there was a large mix of people - young couples, middle aged couples, older couples, families and small groups of friends.

Plenty of choice, lots of fresh food and enough variety over the course of the week. There are 2 A La Carte restaurants which we did try however I actually preferred the food in the main buffet.

Very clean, great variety of food, extremely friendly staff, very comfortable and spacious rooms which were well serviced and kept every day. People complaining about sunbeds? Come on it happens in every country you go to. It's part of life. How much can the hotel realistically do to prevent people getting up early and reserving beds? The pool area is fantastic. Set right on a beautiful sandy beach with multiple bars within walking distance, a swim up bar, a decent selection of drinks, and they even come round with a drinks cart service.

 September 2013,4,Is this a 5 Star Hotel.,"Hotel cleanliness is up to Riu hotel standards especially all public area's. We had several issues at the hotel which you need to be aware of. Sun beds is a major problem, created mainly by the pool staff. The card system does not work, as staff issue clean towels of an evening instead of the card. This allows guests to claim beds as early as 06.00am, when the pool area is not open until 08.00am. Staff would accept money to put towels on beds, identified by by two towels with another spread across tem both. Staff would favour French guests so be forceful, as you will get bypassed. Entertainment is poor especially at night, it was the same guy singing solo or in a group. There is only two theme resturants, one being Moroccan, which is a waste of time booking, as Moroccan food is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Ages ranging from 66 to 3 and I'm pleased to say that we all enjoyed our stay and will definitely return as soon as we can. The hotel has a splendid lobby with a large comfortable seating area and the entertainers who performed around the main lobby bar area did an excellent job. There is another area with two more bars where you can see see more speciality shows.

Management did say we woud find it better on our return and I must admit there were some drastic changes. Service was better in both the resteraunt and the bars. This could have been because we had been there before. However, my only gripe this time was the repetative food available, and some plates were hot some cold as was thevfood hat was being served. You can always find something to eat may not be exactly what you wanted but you would not starve.

It was very quiet at night, no slamming doors and stilettos across the floor. The staff in all areas of the hotel, but especially around the pool were first class and nothing was too much trouble. The sun bed hogging was a little annoying but we always managed to get sunbeds. I would recommend the aqua gym it was great fun. There are two pool bars to choose from so no problems with queues. We tried the moroccan and krystal restaurants and although they were lovely the food was no different to that in the buffet, just with waitress service.

Mini bar in the room is free and can be stocked how you like, we filled up with coke to add to some Spiced Rum we had. There is Wifi almost everywhere even by the pool which meant the connection speed was good.

The food was lovely and varied, ( some people moaned about it being the same every day, yes, the staples were such as potatoes, chips and pizza, but I managed to eat something different every day.

Overall we were very impressed with most aspects, however... The drinks get a bit dull and tired but that's easily done when they're fully comped on tap. However, they do use pretty cheap ingredients for the cocktails, making them all taste like haribo - which doesn't help.

 September 2013,4,"Nice hotel, good value for a week's break","My husband and I stayed for 1 week in Sept, mainly to play golf, which we did 4 times at the Golf du Soleil course. Hotel generally met our expectations based on the price we paid. We have been to All Inc worldwide and realise that they vary, but this one was pretty good overall and we would consider another visit there. Food - one of the widest selections we have seen in buffet restaurants. I'm not a fan of buffet as I like food to be piping hot, but they were regularly replenishing dishes so this was not a problem. Good choice at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also visited the Moroccan and Krystal a la carte restaurants and these were both fine and made a change from the buffet. Book these as soon as you get there if you want a choice on date and time as they do get…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

If its food overload your after go here. everything you can think of they have it, and because its a busy hotel, or it was when i was there August 2013 the food is basically cooked and eaten straight away, We went for a week and came home bloated, didnt hear one person mention dodgey tummys there the whole time, in Egypt its all we heard, If your a man you get treated better than women, but thats o.k i dont want to be pestered whilst on holiday anyway.

 August 2013,5,"Lovely hotel, just be aware of the weather...","This is a little later than I would have normally reveiwed, simply technical fault on my behalf! My partner and I stayed here for a week after spending four nights in Marrakech, also through Riu. I stay away a lot and personally found the hotel on the whole was excellent. The staff were very attentive and helpful and yes, a little tip doesnt go amiss here and there. We were all inclusive and as many of the other reviewers found, the food was of a very high standard through out the day particularilly if you can get into the specialist restuarants. I say if as you need to ensure you go straight the contact at the restuarant door on arrival to try and book (we didnt and had to wait until 9pm to get into the alacarte during Ramadam- well worth it though!).

We arrived early am and check in was very quick and efficient, really didn't except our room to be available but we was pleasantly surprised.. it was. I emailed the hotel a week previous requesting floor 4 and we received the 4th floor with a side Sea View - 4125. Yes all the even numbers are pool/sea views but we was very happy with our room and view (at no extra supplements.) The room was cleaned every day and if you wanted your sheets changing you had the option to place the card on the bed and the maid would happily change the bedding for you, we did tip her everytime she changed our sheets as its very hard work.

 August 2013,5,Very relaxing break,"My husband I have just returned from yet another visit to a Riu hotel and again we had a wonderful time. If you are a sun worshipper, it may not be an ideal time of year to visit Agadir. We had 3 days of full sun out of 7 with 2 days not seeing the sun at all, however it was still hot after the sea mist cleared. Mind you we've both come back with decent tans. The hotel is extremely clean and the staff are unbelievably friendly especially the bar and pool staff. After just one day, our drinks were ready for us as we approached the bar...I cannot understand the comments about them being watered down, you really must have a drink problem if you think that!! I disagree with the comments too about the French getting preferential treatment, we certainly were made to feel special. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,4,No draught beer,"Having to drink warm beer pored from a can is not my idea of good start to a holiday. The manager told me they were having trouble with the beer supplier, so this could be sorted out by now. This was my fifteenth stay in a riu hotel and was happy with the buffet food, krystals worth a try but pass on the other two. Not up there with the other riu palaces I have been to, more of a riu club hotel. Being football mad I thought it lacked facilities of a sports bar, but if you chase the animation team around they will put the football on in the show bar. The weather was perfect for me, bit of cloud cover in the morning so you could go walking in comfort, and sunny after elevenish. I did speak to a few holiday makers complaining of the lack of sun as they laid there with their bright…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2013,4,Very Good Hotel,"My fiancé and I have just arrived back from a great stay at Riu Palace following a 10 night stay starting on August 26th. While the hotel isn't perfection, we've really struggled to understand some of the negative reviews for what is on the whole a really lovely hotel. Ill start with the slight negatives that we found. If you are a complete sun worshipper, it may not be the best time of year to come. We had only two days whereby we woke up and it was sunny throughout the whole day. That being said, we only had one day where we didn't really see the sun.....other than that every other day late morning/lunchtime, the sun appeared and was baking....we've both come back with decent tans.....

Getting to the hotel, take a pen in your hand luggage. Landing cards, and forms on the coach to the hotel need to be filled out. Reception, we checked in without an issue, as we arrived late food and drinks were still available for us. The next morning I asked to change rooms, as our first room was overlooking a gate, security guard and locals walking past very close to the balcony. We were moved to a room with a fabulous sea view on the top floor, so cannot knock the staff at all. Rooms, great as people have said previously. 2 in 1 soap dispenser in the shower is what you get in an Ibis hotel, I expected more here, toiletries very poor.

An honest review,"We are coming to the end of our stay here, this review will most likely be very long but I have a few points and opinions which I will do in sections. We are a young couple in our early twenties and have been 5* all inclusive in Mexico, Egypt and the Dominican Republic so we can compare. Arrival On arrival we were greeted with a cocktail which has been mentioned many times, we arrived with a large group of Thomson travellers but were at the front of the queue to check-in luckily. The reception staff were lovely, I don't understand people who say they are rude although maybe they change if you have any problems you need solving. We arrived late at night so the late buffet was open for us, we didn't find much we liked to be honest, it was mostly cold salad. Some guests will more…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,4,Good hotel - weather an issue,"Prior to going to Agadir I read hundreds of reviews on both the resort and the hotel. While many differ in opinion, they all on the whole have some validity.. Weather: The weather on the whole was hot, but there were days when the sea mist and cloud meant that the sun didn't break through until late in the day. All this meant was that I changed my routine and if I wanted to do an activity, it was invariably scheduled for the morning and I stayed by the pool until later in the day. I spoke to the rep, who confirmed that the best weather is April to June and then September to November. This said I have returned with the deepest tan, I have had for many a year. Pool Scene: This makes me smile, I read on here people whining and whining that you have to be up by 6am to get this…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2013,3,Don't expect five star service,We are coming to the end of our stay here at the moment. I'll start with the good points. The rooms are large. The hotel is clean and large. The food is fresh although two of my family have had upset stomachs and the buffet changes enough that it doesn't get to repetitive. . But as many people have already said it is not a five star quality hotel but it does offer fair value for the amount you are paying Thompson for an all inclusive holiday. The staff service does vary from excellent to downright rude and it is definitely better for men to order at a bar not women. The mangers often told the serving stafffoff in front of me for their poor service. Also to get good service I suggest sitting the same place each day and tipping something from day one.

 August 2013,4,High expectations not quite met,"Let me start by saying that we had a wonderful and relaxing holiday, and overall, this hotel is very good, however, your view of this hotel will of course depend on what your barometer is, and where you’ve stayed in the past. Check-In Like many people, our holiday was booked via Thomson as a package; therefore, we arrived on a coach full of people all wishing to check-in at the same time. We were welcomed with a drink (very sweet and sickly), dropped our bags in the lobby and checked-in. Our keys and credentials were waiting for us. You then tag your own bags and they are taken to your room for you. As we had arrived late (after dinner time), a cold buffet was left open for us which was most welcome.

The reception, bar, poolside and restaurant staff were all helpful and very friendly. The service at all of the bars was quick. The drinks were absolutely delicious. This hotel added little touches like olives and nuts with your cocktails and best of all champagne at breakfast EVERY morning, Other RIU hotels have only managed that one on a Sunday! All of the meals were amazing...in fact I gained 10lbs in weight over the 10 day break!

The room was cleaned every day and all areas of the hotel were spotless. The food in the main restaurant was varied and plenty of lovely dishes every night, you are spoilt for choice.

The service was excellent and all the staff were a credit to the hotel but the hotel is alot busier than we thought it would be. We are a couple in our 30's and if you don't have children this is definately not the hotel to stay in. The children were really naughty and extremely noisy and some of the parents just didn't seem to have any control over them. In fact one day a child had screamed for that long in the pool a man got off his bed and shouted for him to keep quiet and to be perfectly honest everyone agreed with him.

I went to this hotel with my mum (I'm 19) and as soon as we arrived we were impressed. There were quite a few of us visiting this hotel at the same time so the queue to reception was pretty long but we were all welcome by cocktails and the queue went down in minutes. Our suitcases were then labelled and taken up to our rooms by a porter. We visited our room just to see what we had got and we were impressed, it backed onto a path to the side of the hotel but we weren't fussed, it was never loud (only once when a holiday camp full of kids went down and were singing songs but they were on holiday too and it was only once).

The rooms are amazing clean and spacious, on a whole the hotel was very clean at all times, the staff were always ready to help too, and so was our holiday rep :)) There was several things going on during the day, and if you wanted to you could explore out of the hotel, where is where you see the locals in their shops or along the promenade selling their goods, remember this is how they make their living, I found it quite daunting at first but had to remember I was I'm…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our room was a twin room with a pool view. I would recommend the view upgrade, simple because some of the rooms on the other side of the hotel look out onto streets which could become busy at night (street sellers etc).

Without being picky no optics on wall, no bathrobes or slippers, not properly 24hr allinclusive, you couldn't even get a coffee bought to the room let alone something decent to eat.

We had lots of fun and it hasn't put us off the Riu hotels (which we stay in regularly). There are however a few niggles that unfortunatly put a little dampner on our break but did not by any means ruin it. POSITIVES - *The hotel itself is beautiful. The lobby, restaurants, room etc are presented to a high standard and are all very clean. Room was very spacious and comfortable and mini bar was restocked regularly. *We were very lucky for all of our stay wth the sunbeds...... we never got up earlier than 9am and always got a great spot (6 of our 11 days were spent on the plush sunbeds including 2 days on the big double sunlounger!) *The food was lovely!

 June 2013,4,Amazing hotel but boring,"Riu Palace Tikida is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The hotel is luxurious. Beautiful rooms, pool area, restaurants & bar. The location was also good - close to the town centre. The entertainment however is very poor. The average age of the hotel guests is 45 and over. If you are a young group/couple there is no entertainment nor drinks served in the bar/lobby area after midnight. You can order them to your room but if you are a bit louder they will send security. I would definitely recommend it to my parents (55-60).",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

I have always been unsure about going all inclusive and was apprehensive about the food quality prior to going. However, the food was GORGEOUS. The variety was great, even for vegetarians.

 August 2013,4,Fantastic hotel and staff!!,We stayed at this hotel from the 15th-22nd August 2013 and we must say that it was a extremely delightful experience. The hotel is extremely clean and well maintained. The food was extremely good quality although a little variation would help. Our room was extremely well presented the style both fitted the North African & European taste. During our stay we felt very welcome and all the staff always had a smile on there face! I would recommend this hotel for families and couples. A few minor issues such as sunbeds as you need to get those early morning.

Our room was facing out on to the street but we didn't mind as we didn't spend much time in there anyway. The even numbered rooms face towards the pool and sea. The bathroom has shutter doors which make it quite easy to hear what people are doing behind those doors... as said previously by someone, you will get to know your partner if you don't already.

The hotel is beautiful and well kept the rooms are lovely and worthy of the 5 stars. Unfortunately the service and amenities lets this hotel down and should be rated as a 3 star plus. The pool area is crowded and you need to get up early to reserve a sunbed. The drinks trolley only comes round once a day by the pool and there is no waiter service which really isn't good enough. There is no children's pool so the children use the jacuzzi to play in so it is not possible to relax and enjoy.

The hotel is located in Agadir a busy port and beach resort sprawling on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Its location, adjacent to the beachfront promenade, gives the hotel a refreshing sense of space and enables you to have direct access to Moroccan beach and street life. The sandy beach offers clean water, safe swimming and a glimpse into the vibrancy of Moroccan family life in the summer. On entering the hotel’s large and sumptuous reception we were greeted warmly by staff and were given a glass of Moroccan champagne.

It truly is a 5 star hotel, the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. I have come to the conclusion that some people are just born to complain and will find fault for the sake of it. I have better things to do on holiday than search for things to moan about.

I'm writing this while enjoying our final day of sunshine on a four poster sun lounger by the pool. My girlfriend and I have been at the Riu Palace for 11 nights and experienced what I would regard as genuine 5 star quality; standard rooms are tastefully furnished and spacious, while staff are efficient and friendly. What I have also appreciated is the sincerity of the staff - smiles are genuine and not painted on as in some hotels. In fact, everyone, from the waiters to pool attendants, are willing to go the extra mile without the uncomfortable expectation of a tip for their troubles.

The mini fridge was restocked every 2 days. The second day we were given a welcome presentation which was ok however, this was the only time we actually saw our rep. After this she was no where to be seen.

They show no respect and have absolutely no people skills to any of the British guests. In addition the female reception staff are quite possibly the rudest people I have ever come across.

Food was brilliant, however did get a little repetitive towards the end of our holiday so we ate out a couple of times to break it up, please note this was only because we opted to and not because we felt we needed to!

 August 2013,5,'Different Class',"We have just returned back from 2 weeks at the Riu Palace and can honestly say it's a different class to others that we have visited (check out where we have also stayed) especially as it was the first 2 weeks in August and probably their busiest period. General: Transfer time from the Airport to the hotel was about 25 minutes and although we had to wait slightly for our room before we could check into it, it offered us time to walk round the hotel to get our bearings and sample some of the alcoholic delights of Morocco. The hotel was immaculate throughout, very clean, very tidy and very spacious.The Pool area was very large and offered good spaces for sunbathing. The Restaurants and food was very good with the added option of going to the Krystal/Moroccan and newly formed…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,5,Fitness instruction was brilliant,"We had a two week stay at the Riu Palace in July. The holiday was fantastic. The hotel is immaculate and beautifully set out. One of the real bonuses of the holiday was the Riufit programme led by Hamada. I had hoped that there would some exercise classes but I didn't expect the wide range of activities that were on offer. I went to Pilates, abs and back strengthening sessions. Hamada was absolutely brilliant in leading the classes. As well as having first-class technical skills Hamada also injected a real sense of fun into his classes. If you want to improve your fitness on holiday the Palace should be the top of your list.

 August 2013,4,Great hotel with superb food and service...,"We stayed at this hotel in August 2013. The hotel is very new and the rooms are fantastic with very modern bathrooms that look like they have just been installed. Service is very good at this hotel and the staff cannot do enough for you. They wait on you hand and foot whether it be breakfast lunch or dinner. They will constantly keep your glass full, although they can be a little eager to clear plates. The food is excellent and a fantastic spread was put on every day. We especially liked the oriental food night but we never felt ill or saw anything untoward in terms of food cleanliness or hygiene. Most of the food is cooked in front of you. The hotel has two table service restaurants and we went to the Krystal which was very nice food, if a little lacking in atmosphere. There…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Brilliant 5 star hotel,"Fantastic hotel. Nice, comfortable and big rooms, great food, nice pool area and nice beach. The spa was also great, with amazing value. Agadir is not the most interesting resort to look around, as it is a very touristy area of Morocco (the European Morocco apparently), however there are plenty of excursions that can take you from the resort to see the 'true' Morocco.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,5,Fab,"Spent 11 nights at the Palace from 25th July to 4th August. Beautiful hotel, staff couldn't do enough for us. We were a party of 6 (including two teenage girls) and had a really relaxing time - no mean feat with teenagers in tow... Food was lovely, wine was great and can recommend the mojitos and custard slices in particular (maybe not together though). Visited the Moroccan and Krystal Fusion restaurants. Both were lovely settings, the manager of the hotel welcomed us and personally poured us champagne to drink while we waited for our table to become available. The food in the Moroccan wasn't really to our taste but was beautifully presented. The Krystal Fusion on the other hand was stunning and would love to have had some of their recipes... maybe they should produce a cookbook…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,5,Perfect,"Myself and fiancé stayed here after a trip to Marrakech and the mountains. We were looking for a relaxing experience. This is certainly what we received. The service was excellent, food excellent (including the additional Moroccan and Krystal restaurant). We did have a few issues with the safe and our room key which resulted in a few trips back to reception and visits from the handyman but all were very helpful and prompt. A superb stay at the hotel, shame we had 2 days of sun out of 5 due to the mist which covers the whole beach/hotel. Still very hot though! A truly relaxing holiday and excellent value for money with all the food and drink available! Would definitely like to go again and would most certainly return to a Riu Palace hotel at another location.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,5,A luxurious relaxing break,"Checked in at the Riu Palace on Thursday 1st August 2013 with my sister and mum to enjoy 7 nights of relaxing and chilling out. This was actually my second visit to the Riu Palace, after staying for a week with my boyfriend back in May 2012, shortly after the hotel had opened. I am pleased to say that this second visit was even better than the first especially as all of the finishing touches are now complete. I didn't write a review after my first visit, but thought I should do one this time round! Weather - If you are looking for pure sunshine each and every day of your holiday then this isn't the place for you, despite what the holiday brochures and websites say, Agadir rarely has a completely blue sky. However, this shouldn't spoil your holiday, out of our 7 days in August,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,5,Shame about the weather!!!,"We arrived on the 29th July, hotel was great lovely food and plenty of it and of course drink. They had the resturant open for us when we arrived late at night which was good. Never struggled to find a sun bed even if it was one with out the cushions. Staff were great, evening entertainment wasnt very gd so we just explode and found a few Moroccan bars, piano piano was gd. The room was always serviced to a high standard every day even one day when we didn't leave the room till late afternoon.,On our return it had been serviced for us. For us the only downside was the weather , it just wasn't sunny like u like to see every morning when u open ur curtains! It wasn't cold but for us the fog and mist was a bit disheartening as we did want sunshine ! Wouldn't go again for this reason…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,3,PUT EVERYTHING VALUABLE IN THE SAFE!!!!,"We were very impressed with the hotel at first but within hours of being there my daughter's purse was taken from the room full of money. As mentioned in one of the other reviews, the only person who entered the room was the person who restocks the mini bar/fridge in the room. We reported the incident straight away and got nowhere with the assistant manager who then called in the ""smooth"" manager who just more or less defended the person who took the purse stating that he didn't take it and then tried to turn it around saying that the hotel was all inclusive anyway and we didn't need the money!!

When we got there the room is very good ,spacious and comfortable .We where a party of twelve, ages twelve to sixty five ,and found the food to be excellent with plenty of variety. It was a good job we where a party as the evening entertaiment was a bit of a let down with most guest not bothering As stated in previous reviews the resort of Agadir is a bit boring with just a nice prom to walk along .The local market is worth a trip, 20 by taxi,make sure you go to the open market and not the fixed price one. If you book a trip to marrakech through thompson beware, we knew it would be a long day but did not realise we would be spending upto 4 hours…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2013,5,Stunning Hotel,I have just returned from a fantastic week in Agadir. The staff were beyond attentive and helpful and the resort was spotlessly clean. There was a huge selection of food and beverages on offer and we felt spoilt for choice. Our room was spacious and extremely clean. I would certainly recommend this resort to anyone thinking about visiting Agadir. Completely worth the money.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,5,Amazing hotel but be aware of the heat mist that come in,"My Husband and I stayed for 2 weeks from the 25th July. We had 5 days, Monday to Friday when we didn't really see the sun. There was 2 of the 5 days when the sun never came out at all. However it was still hot and you could sunbathe in it. You could still feel the heat of the sun and if you didn't put sun cream on you would of burnt. The sun bed situation isn't bad like other reviews state. Yes you don't get a sun bed with thick cushions if you are up late like my husband and I, but there is always a big stack of normal sun beds. There is more than enough for everyone in the hotel. Also they are free on the beach and there are loads on there too. We never got our beds until we had eaten breakfast which was usually about ten o'clock. Also if you are struggling to find a bed…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2013,4,Good holiday but some issues.,"I agree with most of the positive comments about this hotel. All inclusive resorts usually have boring food issues, with a disorganised bunfight in the main restaurant. Definitely ask for a top floor room as we were underneath a family whose hobby was dragging chairs around all evening. Skreeeeeeech! The staff were very good but reception seemed a bit disinterested in any problems. Speak French. Sun-lounger bagging with towels is out of control as previous reviewers have said. Any decent spots were all towelled by 6:30 a.m. I have a lovely photo of the entire poolside area towelled up at 10:a.m. with about 3 people using them. Grrrrr! Had a great time with the kids all the same and would recommend it more off season e.g Easter or October I suspect, with fewer people. More than a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We didn't book a sea view room but got one anyway which was lovely and also looked over gardens. The room was more like a suite and they all appear to be this big, as said before tea and coffee making facilities and free mini bar with coke, sprite, Fanta and beer. The breakfast and evening meal restaurant was very good and we always managed to get a table outside, looking over the gardens/pools and sea can't understand why most people prefer to be squashed together inside.

From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty as youd expect at a 5 star. Room was pool/sea facing which appeared to be the best and was incredibly spacious with minibar (free and stocked) and very clean. In fact the hotel is one of the best looked after ive seen with regular maid visits and extensive cleaning throughout. They even cleaned all the rugs in the vast reception twice during our stay! Food in the buffet restaurants was very good although did get a little dull after 2 weeks, but then what all inclusive doesnt?!? The two a la carte restaurants were excellent, with the pick being the moroccan for my money. It was a slight dissapointment that they did not use…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,5,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for two weeks for my partner's birthday. The service was outstanding in each restaurant we went to, the food was great and the fact that the room service and the mini bar were included as part of the all inclusive package was an added bonus. The guys at the bar were attentive without expecting any tips (we tipped on our last day). The only down side was the pool beds getting reserved early, however this did not bother us as there were still beds available by the pool, bar and the beach as well. I would highly recommend this hotel!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We were then met by a lovely girl in reception who gave up are room keys whilst our bags were taken to the room. Our room was fantastic with a pool view on the top floor, immaculately cleaned prior to our arrival.

Add to that a stay in a top class efficient hotel right alongside a gorgeous sandy private beach in a clean safe setting and you have the makings of a perfect vacation. The Tikida Palace Hotel certainly meets the accommodation criteria. The staff here are helpful, friendly and cheerful and many have a cheeky sense of fun. Everyone from the cleaning staff to the senior management is committed to delivering personal attention and service which is of course only expected of a five star hotel but they do it very well indeed.

We knew this year's holiday would not be in the same league, especially as it was half the price. However, on our return we feel that it didn't quite meet our expectations in a few areas. THE POSITIVES The Riu Tikida Palace is a beautiful hotel. The decor and the grounds can't fail to impress even the most experienced traveller. The dark wood throughout does make some areas a bit dark but that is outweighed by the luxurious quality. The grounds of this hotel are excellent - the grass looks as though it has been painted on!

We arrived on a late flight from manchester so by the time we'd checked in etc. is was passed the 'stated' serving times for evening food. However, the hotel had arranged for us to be well catered for and looked after upon our arrival. The service from the staff that we received was first class, friendly, welcoming, always happy to assist and very co-operative.

The hotel looks fantastic and is exceptionally clean. Our rooms were cleaned and tidied every day, with fresh towels and the mini-bar restocked. The room was perfect and had a very large, comfortable bed. The food and drink was of good quality with plenty to choose from. We only managed a meal in the Morrocan restaurant as the Krystal was fully booked. It was a nice change to try the a la carte restaurant and the decor was lovely, however, some of the food was an acquired taste! My boyfriend did say that the lamb kebabs were 'amazing' though.

The communal parts of the hotel and gardens were attractive and well maintained with well thought out fixtures, fittings and furnishings however we did change rooms twice within the first couple of days, the first due to very noisy occupants above us and the second because the room location was just inferior to the first – with one of the only views facing a wall. On both occasions the hotel staff handled our requests in a friendly if less than efficient manner (it did take lots of reminding and chasing up on the reception desk) but the end result was a very nice room with good storage, a view of the pools and decent standard of bathroom again with good fixtures and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2012,2,Would never stay here again,"Great hotel with all the facilities. But, appalling staff and service. This ruined our trip. We could not go swimming together - even for ten mins - as our belongings would be taken from our sunbeds. We had to continuously call reception for room supplies, such as loo roll! When eating in the restaurants the waitresses would not just lean across me to clear anything from the table, they'd actually push me out of the way. On our last day, despite having paid for late check out, we returned to our room at 10am to find our keycard did not work anymore. When, eventually, this was sorted out and we gained access to our room again, we found that another couple had just arrived and were in our room!!!

 July 2013,4,Fantastic hotel but one MAJOR IRRITATION -own policy not applied,We are currently on day 4 of a 14 night stay and we are really pleased with our choice of hotel and have to agree with the reviews that have gone before. There is only one issue that has really spoilt out stay today. The hotel has a policy of no reserving sun beds - fair enough - and towels removed if not used for two hours - but on our first two days we arrived at the pool at 7.30am to find all the 'pole position' beds taken. This is an issue for us as we have a four year old so we prefer to be at the waters edge so we can keep eye on her in the pool. Today we decided if you 'can't beat em join em' so got up (with many others) to put some towels down at 6.30am.

Riu Palace Agadir lives up to it's name. The buffet wasn't cheap and stale. The food was of good quality, fresh and varied. We only stayed here for 4 days and I was gutted I had to leave. There isn't much to Agadir. It really is just a resorts after resorts. Therefore it is important you choose the right resort and my boyfriend and I was really happy about the choice.

The 'walk-through' wardrobe was great & unlike other reviews, we had no issues with our sliding doors! Anyway, this led to a big bathroom, with double sink and with a toilet behind French doors.

Most of the staff which have been there for some time recognised us, even the security guard commented on it being our third time at the hotel. ( How do they remember.) The service was second to none. The hotel was nearly full and we had no problem in the restaurants getting food, and always to have the sun beds we wanted. The service at all meals was excellent, we had good waiters at breakfast and lunch and our waitress at dinner was excellent with us. Being our third time we expected the food to be as good as previous, but on this holiday the food was even better the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,5,Amazing Hotel,"As a frequent traveller, i've been lucky to have stayed at some of the worlds best hotels and i honestly would rate Riu Palace Tikida as one of them. This hotel is perfect from its very comfortable and elegant rooms to their super kind and very professional and helpful staff. Food and Drink was never a problem is it was available 24 hours a day, inc free flowing international spirits. A special mention should go out to the all rounder Yousuf for being a valuable asset to the hotel I would strongly recommend this hotel and when in Agadir in the future, we will stay nowhere else.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,4,Excellent hotel but no sun.,"I am sat here at the hotel on my sunbed next to the pool but have yet to see the sun today. The hotel is beautiful with large rooms , clean , excellent staff but no sun . Don't get me wrong , sometimes you get to see the sun but it varies from day to day . It maybe no sun one day , 1 hour sun another and 4 hours another. I believe that July/August are the worst time to visit if you want sun . The sky is covered with a thick sea mist that sometimes does not clear . I understand that other times of the year the weather is beautiful but not July/August. If you are reading this and have already booked then dont worry as you will still enjoy yourself once you've got over the disappointment of lack of sun.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,5,Super family hotel,"Just back after two weeks of quality vacation 1/7 - 15/7 , yes it's all it says on the tin and a little more , but a few things you all should be aware of . 1 air conditioning just about works , you have to leave your room card in to activate the power to your room but we found the do not disturb sign fitted just fine. 2. The hotel is advertised as a 24 hour service but at midnight the lobby bar is closed at12:00 sharp and by 12:30 you will be sitting in darkness . 3. The food is of good quality with a buffet resturant and 2 themed diners , a Moroccan one and fusion a sort of mixture but beware on Fridays only the buffet is open where 940 guests will be fed between 7:30 until 10:00 so be prepared to queue for any of the meat or fish dishes as they are cooked fresh in batches…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2012,5,Amazing relaxing holiday,"We went here wanting to have a really relaxing stress free holiday and that's exactly what we got. The rooms were large, clean and decorated tastefully and we really enjoyed having a seaview balcony view. It was great having free wifi too. We never had a problem getting sunbeds although we were usually up quite early but even late morning you'd still see beds available. The sunbeds had nice thick cushions and there were often a lot of parasols available if required. The pool swim up bar was nice and relaxing and you could get all the normal drinks from there including cocktails (alcoholic and non alcoholic) throughout the day. We didn't spend much time on the beach area but as its sectioned off it seemed pleasant enough and when we walked on the beach there were sellers but…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Nice hotel but could be anywhere,"We stayed for 14ntys our first time all inc the hotel its self lovely, we found it to be very dark in the main lobby areas due to the colours brown, cream. the rooms were large very clean but lots of noise 8am onwards from maids above draging beds out to clean.The food for me was nothing much just a mix and match of pasta salads the odd fish dish that at the time we stayed a lot of guests were ill due to it not being fully cooked, we did try the maroccan restrant dont bother the food was a fixed menu the soup cold and not much to be excited about. The beach is lovely we spent most of the time there with the local people we then saw the real marrocco the people are lovely.Have a walk outside on the beach go right its a lovley walk lots of bars/resrants also opps the hotel cross…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,5,Fantastic time!,"Wonderful hotel and holiday, this hotel is everything it promises and the staff give it more, they cannot do enough for you. As on honeymoon, got upgraded to a suite, which was fantastic. Only complaint was that the towel policy by the pool was not enforced and people got up early, left their towels on the best spaces and went out for the day. The pool staff did as much as they could be placing more loungers, but obviously the management, did not feel the need to enforce their own policy of 2 hours and your items are removed. Shame, because that was the only complaint we had to make. Saying this we would definitely go back again and recommend!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,5,Peaceful Palace,"The hotel lived up to its billing. It's extremely spacious from the huge reception and bar/lounge area right down past the pools to the seafront. Beautifully decorated and furnished, there is ample choice of places to relax both in the day and at night. Whether by design or not there are no great gathering areas which contributed to the peaceful atmosphere. Food and drink were plentiful and we certainly did not suffer from short measures. The staff were more that attentive and very friendly in both bars and restaurants. Service standards were always high. The manager and his deputy turned up at the reps greeting with a clear message that they were proud of their hotel and that if we had any problems they were the ones to speak to. It would have been easy to do so as they were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,4,"Lovely hotel, but.....","We stayed at the Riu Palace for two weeks from the 27th June this year. As many have said the hotel itself is lovely, very spacious and clean, as is the pool area. On the whole the staff are friendly and helpful. The food was of a good quality and varied. It is certainly better than other so called 5 Star resorts on the African continent. It can be a bit repetitive, however if you don't load your plate with a little bit of everything everyday then you can find something different to eat every mealtime. This is an extremely busy hotel, with a lot of families and children, so the pool area and restaurants can at times feel crowded. The area surrounding the hotel is good for a walk, especially the promenade down to the marina, however this will only be enough to keep you…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,5,Absolutely amazing hotel !,"Well, where to start. Me and my girlfriend visited this hotel on the 4th July - 11th July. This hotel is definitely the best hotel I've ever been to. It's decor is amazing, clean and new. As you may have heard about the wether, it is rather cloudy until 11:30 but thereafter the sun is beaming, reaching 35-40. I've never had such a nice tan. The food is lovely and varied, but does get a little repetitive from day to day. The waiters are absolutely great, always smiling and we never had an empty glass, didn't even have to tip. Personally, I thought the location was great, just behind the hotel was a lovely promenade which is a couple miles long. Also, the drinks are named drinks which is a great touch. I couldn't believe the rooms, stunning. Very comfy beds and pillows, lovely…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2013,4,Beautiful soulless hotel,"The hotel and grounds and kept very clean and tidy. There is a sense of 'space' about the place. We didn't get off to a good start when a) there was no welcome on arrival, b) the reception staff were quite rude when we were all trying to check in (there was about 10 of us staying here as part of a twin centre with Marrakech) and c) we had to change rooms as there was a smell of drains which would come and go. Once settled into our new room, it was spotlessly clean and quite spacious. I didn't find that the cleaning of the room for the rest of the week wasn't as expected for a 5T hotel the floors weren't moped, sometimes the toilet roll wasn't replenished and on one day we didn't get any water and after complaining to reception twice and waiting 1.5 hrs in our room, eventually…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,4,"Great Hotel, would recommend it","Beautiful hotel and great for the money, you get what you pay for and a little bit more I'd say. If you've paid over £2,000 for two of you in June, you've not been doing your homework. Negatives In the mornings the cleaners drag the furniture and makes a hell of a noise (they start at 7 am) so lie-ins can sometimes be tough, if they are nearby. All they need is those little felt feet on the legs, job done! Facilities are a little on the lite side, gym is a big room with not a lot in it for example. There are comfy sunbeds and there are hard ones and everyone does the towel thing at 8 in the morning to get their beds - if you don't, you don't get one of the lovely comfy ones and my aren't they comfy.

 June 2013,3,"Avoid if Internet-dependent, Have a Sophisticated Palate or are Asthmatic","Sadly, 5 ""T""s in the holiday brochure is does not correspond to a true ""5 star"" hotel, and here's why: Room: Spacious and clean, but bed extremely hard, no chain or spy hole on door, no separate shower (instead, step over the 2' high side of the bath onto no rubber mat). Replenishment of minibar and tea/coffee ingredients was very hit and miss. Air conditioning not very effective and in-room internet non-existent (more about these issues later). English-speakers have the choice of BBC or Sky News, whereas our European cousins have a plethora of TV channels at their disposal.

The staff were lovely, and always got what you wanted. The rooms were amazing! I was genuinely shocked to see that it was actually our room and the free mini bar was such a lovely touch! The shower was amazing and the maid always made the bed look pretty which I love. The food was very nice, always something different but you do notice a few of the same things the longer you stay. As other reviews have said people do reserve sunbeds, but until you try the comfortable mattress ones you'll be down there at 8 o'clock to get one too! It is worth it to get a nice one (especially if your sunburnt!) but there is never not one sunbed…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our room was lovely, (ask for a 4th floor pool view if poss, we did and got it), had to wait a while for cases though. They kept the restaurant open and we could have a light meal before bed. The next day we took advantage of the extensive buffet breakfast with full english, fruit, pastries, omelettes/eggs cooked how you like.

Believe all the good reviews about the rooms, showers, food, drinks, staff, location and attention to detail - it's all true! The only things we had a problem with were the people upstairs clopping around in heels (?) at 2 am and dragging furniture (please management put little felt pads on the bottom!) and the weather - which was pretty much cloudy for two weeks (something I hadn't anticipated and all the weather sites said it was wall-to-wall sunshine!). I would love to go back to this hotel - I came home feeling really spoilt and relaxed.

 June 2013,5,"Great hotel, excellent service","We stayed at the Riu Palace Tikida for a week from 20th June. The transfer from the airport was only 30 mins, with everyone on the coach going to the same hotel. If you draw money out from the airport ATM’s then keep your receipt (we did) as you will need this to change your currency back to sterling prior to returning home (Moroccan Dirhams are a closed currency). Upon arrival at the hotel we did get a welcome drink but our room was not ready. However I think we arrived at lunchtime and hotel policy is clearly check in from 3pm. We went to one of the pool bars and had a few drinks until our room was ready.

 July 2013,5,"Lovely hotel, shame about the weather !","My husband and I have just returned from an 11 night holiday at the Riu Palace Tikida, Agadir. We were very impressed with the hotel itself and can comment as follows. The main reception is large with many chairs/sofas where people can sit and enjoy a drink from the adjoining bar. The bar is very busy but we never had to wait long to get a drink. We were pleased to see that branded drinks, e.g. Smirnoff Vodka, Grants Whisky etc. were supplied. There are two main dining rooms which are very large and rather busy, so we chose to sit outside on the patios adjacent to these rooms, which was far more civilised. The selection of food available was wide and varied and there was never a meal where we couldn’t find more than enough to choose from. Breakfast and dinner is taken…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The food catered for all nationalities something for everyone, the breakfast and dinner waiters were magnificent nothing was too much trouble, they was all so helpful especially the waiter called Redouane he looked after us for the whole two weeks.

 July 2013,5,First time in a RIU. First time in Agadir,"We arrived home from Agadir on 6th July 2013. This is a brilliant hotel for everyone. Our room was 4128 on the 4th (top) Floor and was large, well fitted and comfortable. There are loads of TV channels including three news (Sky, BBC World and CNN. Only one in English though, an American with old films and Arabic subtitles. Still you are on holiday so don't need the TV right! It has two outdoor pools linked together with a Jacuzzi in one. The pools ranged from two to five feet deep. There is also an indoor pool. You cannot possibly go hungry here. They have a buffet with lots of choice and it is good quality too. There are two speciality restaurants and both are good. The advertised Italian restaurant was closed though. Bars serve premium brands and have varying opening times. …",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,4,Good break away,"We enjoyed our stay in this hotel, we travelled from 27/6/13 to 4/7/13. The hotel has a new and luxurious feel about it, the lobby furnishings are top drawer and the ambience is really good. The room: We had a standard room and it was very well furnished, though there were one or two small issues with it - the fridge did not open without having to lift it up to get it over a ridge in the wardrobe it was placed in, and one of the taps on the sink was loose and wobbled. Also it seemed the wardrobe had been made so that the drawers that were inside could not be opened - very strange! These were minor points though and did not detract from our stay. The beds were hard and the double bed was two singles pushed together. I accept that this is common practice in lots of places…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is lovely, spotless clean and very friendly.The food was sooo good lots of choice and always being replenished. The Krystal restaurant was ok but not got the fine dining quite right just yet. We didn't try the Moroccan restaurant because there was similar food choice in the main dining hall. Eat outside if you can, so peaceful. The bar staff work really hard, always have a smile (especially Omar ) and always try to serve the person who was next but you have to be vocal sometimes.

The room was large with separate dressing room area and large balcony that was directly facing the sea - we couldn't have asked for more! The room had a mini bar which never went empty and I have to say even the hotel hairdryer was good! (I never even unpacked mine which is a rarity in hotels abroad!). The service from both the restaurant and bar staff was second to none. They were extremely attentive and always friendly and welcoming.

However we were dealt with very quickly, partly due to the help of the assistant manager Raphael as he realised we weren’t part of the party of 190, (we had booked the hotel direct, not through an agent), and were shown to our room well before the advertised check-in time. Raphael was to be seen most days around the hotel and would always speak to guests. The room and bathroom were large, modern and airy though some of the furniture and woodwork were a bit dark.

At the bar they are quick to serve drinks, however you need to make sure you are quite vocal when ordering as the barman are not very good at noticing who was first and has been waiting the longest. They do most drinks and they have big name spirits such as Jack Daniels and Smirnoff Vodka, you just have to make it clear that's what you want (p.s the mojitos are amazing!)

You can sit outside and its quietly away from the madhouse inside. Food nice and fresh and you can feed the local tortoise if you like! Good: Food and service is to a very high standard in the main dinner buffet restaurant. The rose wine is nice too! Krystal restaurant is excellent and the wine really good. The main bar in reception is good. Branded drinks and good service. Shame it stinks of smoke but you get over that.

I am told there are 15 irons for a hotel with 400 rooms. I travel with work and usually stay in budget hotels such as the Premier Inn and they all have irons. A reasonable request would be too purchase more irons so guests are not waiting to use them. The food is ok, but restaurants are very busy and they only have one restaurant open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, which meant a lot of queuing.

A quick call to a very helpful reception got us moved to a top floor room with a sea and pool view straight away which was perfect! The quality of the food for buffet meals was good and all the staff were very helpful. Only point that lets it down slightly is the evening entertainment - the resident band played the same set list every night in one of two bars.

Then there's the entertainment well what there is of it if you want a fun holiday with music things going on DON'T go here its like the staff don't want to get involved and the evening music starts at 9:30 unless there's football on and stops at 11 so when Spain v Italy went to extra time we had 20 mins of entertainment it's the same act night after night.

Two gripes for me having stayed in Tikida Palmeraie, Marrakech. No BBC1 or ITV. I know you don't go on holiday for TV but it's a nice touch to watch something familiar first thing, getting ready or when you return to room as the TP in Marra is only 4* and has this.

 June 2013,3,Not a Riu at it's 5 star best that we expected.,"We have just returned after a week (20th - 27th June 2013). When we arrived our room was not ready. Bad organisation, they know how many guests they are expecting and how many rooms they will need at what times! Considering it is only just over 12 months old, it's not 5 star at it's best. The pools did not have the gradual slopes or steps it get in easily if you are not a confident swimmer or able bodied. The beds in the pool were not there at all either. To get a descent sunned you had to get up at the crack of dawn or pay the pool boys to reserve them for you! This is not something that we have had to do in a Riu before! The hotel was very dark, even when then lights were on. The restaurants and food choice were amazing. The people are so nice and friendly. The cleaning…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,5,Outstanding 5 star hotel that shouldn't have any bad reviews!!,"Having returned from this hotel over a week ago, me and my boyfriend had such an amazing time that I felt almost obliged to write a review! Me and my boyfriend stayed here for a week form 13 June 2013. On arrival at the airport, we were directed to our coach for transfer to the hotel - this was probably the worst part of the trip as we had to wait in the coach for nearly an hour waiting for other passengers, only to find out they had got a taxi to the hotel without telling the rep! When we arrived to check in, there were about 6 members of staff working on the front desk top check everybody in quickly. We had no problems at all checking in and even got a yummy welcome drink on arrival. (My only complaint here is that I had emailed and asked for a room on a higher floor but we…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,4,We definitely picked the best hotel,"Almost everything was perfect about this hotel, there was a wide range of food & as a nut allergy sufferer I had absolutely no problem avoiding nuts. Drinks were lovely, especially the cocktails. Would have been nice if the bars were open past midnight but this wasn't a massive issue. I found the waiters a bit intrusive sometimes, I like to be left in peace to eat but they sometimes made me feel a bit rushed & sometimes my plate was taken from me whilst I was still chewing! The pool & gardens were lovely, we always managed to find somewhere to sit. Most staff were very friendly & helpful & were always willing to answer any questions we had. The only thing I would say was bad about this hotel was the cleaning staff. When I'm on holiday I expect to be able to relax & have a lay…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,5,Very Friendly Staff,"A good quality All Inclusive only Hotel. It is well situated on the main Promenade with easy access to various clubs and restaurants. The hotel provides a high quality of food and service in the main buffet restaurant and in the Krystal a la carte restaurant. The service in the Marakesh a la carte does leave something to be desired. It was the only food outlet in the hotel where I felt that the staff found the customers to be a bit of an inconvenience, The hotel is well appointed and clean although the outdoor pool is still a bit cold in June. Be very cautious of trying to arrange a late check out. The staff on reception don't seem to have the interests of the hotel or its clients at heart. With plenty of time between flights I still couldn't pay to extend my room (others did).…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,5,Amazing and beautiful!,"This hotel is amazing, and such a beautiful place for a holiday! The views from the top bar overlooking the pool and the sea, is just stunning, and it almost looks like an infinity pool (except when you're actually by the pool there is a small hill to go over to get to the beach - this gives more privacy and stops people passing by from being able to look in). out of the front of the hotel from the reception, there are local shops across the road, and out of the back of the hotel from the pool, there is a 30 second walk to the beach. If you turn right from the beach down towards the Agadir sign in the hills, there is a 25 minute walk down to the marina and all the local cafe's and restaurants, but as the hotel is all inclusive you don't really need to go out much.

The hotel was stunning and modern it was so so clean with staff cleaning all day and all night. The hotel is the perfect size, the pool is stunning, and very peaceful to chill out and sunbathe. There were few children and the ones that were there were very pleasant and well behaved. You can have fresh pool towel everyday and also they have books and magazines you can read around the pool. There was a problem with people reserving sun beds all day and not actually using them, but do not hesitate to tell the staff as they were more than happy to whip up peoples towels, or they would find you a bed with no hassle.

The hotel itself was very impressive and we found that the staff were very friendly and couldnt do more for you. The food was lovely and there was lots of choice. All drinks were included in the All Inclusive - even branded spirits and cocktails. A small tip does go a long way!

Entertainment was ok again for 3 nights but it was the same thing for 3 nights but we didn't mind. Stunning reception and the only people we seen smoke as other complain about in the lobby was the entertainment staff. 2 restaurants were a nice change to get away from the buffet.

Food great in buffet and both a la carte restaurants, surroundings beautiful.

 June 2013,5,Lovely Hotel,"Just back from a 10 day twin center holiday this hotel being the one we stayed a week in, after arriving from Marrakesh. It really is lovely as every one has said. Real problem with sun beds you could hear people flip flopping down the corridors at 6am to get towels on beds So so sad!!!There is a notice around the pool saying they must not be reserved. My only other gripe is they definately favour other nationalaties and make us Brits wait for drinks, we do not get the good tables and some times are completely ignored at pool bars!! this really needs addressing.Met some lovely people Hi Chris and Scott.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Fantastic Holiday,"Total agree with the previous comments about this hotel. Its a fantastic hotel, with 99.9% of the staff being amazingly helpful and friendly. All the restaurants were superb, I especially enjoyed the Krystal, it was a fantastic experience but have to say my wife wasn't as keen as she is a vegetarian, and sadly the veggie main choices in both speciality restaurants were a little uninspiring. However on our 3rd visit to the Krystal, upon our request the chef prepared her something different from the menu choice which was a nice touch. The rooms were very nice, modern, clean and very comfortable, however have to agree with other reviews the design does lead to a lot of noise from above and around due to doors being slammed and chairs being scraped.

Hotel grounds are immaculate, as are the various bar and pool areas . All the staff were very pleasant and all the time we were there they went out of their way to help us .

Having stayed in many all inclusive hotels i can honestly say this is the best so far. The quality of everything from the decor to the food is amazing. The sun loungers are fantastic and we managed to get one of the large balinese beds most days. We took advantage of the room service for breakfast in bed a few times and my husband took advantage of the branded drinks, cocktails and champagne (im not a big drinker!) the resort is clean and the locals very friendly and polite.

We didn't have a pool view but didn't mind as we prefered to watch the world go by out the back :) The food was brilliant, loads of choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

 June 2013,4,An Impressive Hotel,Id really like to give a balanced opinion of how my wife and I found our stay at the Riu Tikida Palace Hotel in Agadir. We arrived around 23.30 hours on Thursday 30th May 2013 and upon entering the hotel were very pleased with the reception area. Check in was quick and we were allocated a 2nd floor room. Having read reviews on TA suggesting a high floor was best I immediately asked if our room could be on either the 3rd or 4th floor. Without any hesitation our room was changed with a smile. We walked through the lobby area to our 4th floor room and our bags arrived within 10/15 mins. Being thirsty and hungry we went directly to the bar where the bar man Kareem was closing he was really pleasant and made sure we had a couple of drinks lined up to tied us over. After the drinks we…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our room was perfect, food and drink was faultless... though I didn't like the fact that guests could smoke at the bars.... however you don't have to go the bars for your drinks as the waiters are very attentive and look after you. We loved it in an evening relaxing in the foyer where there is very comforatable seating and 'wi-fi' connection (how did we manage without?) The pools were gorgeous - though most of our swimming was done in the idoor pool, because it was so quite we had loads of choice for sun beds and sofas. Our room got the sun all day and was brill.

The bathroom area was exceptional with his and her sinks, separate toilet and the best shower I have ever used. The food and service in all the restaurants was exceptionally good for an all inclusive, even by RIU's very high standards (this was our 3rd stay in a RIU hotel).

Superb selection of breakfast foods and 6 different fresh smoothies to be had each day (banana yummy) and cooking stations for fresh omelettes and fried eggs and pancakes and crêpes. Lunch is taken at the pool restaurant and again great with a fantastic selection of salads plus the usual pizza pasta and cooked dinners all served with wine (by the bottle if you want it) Dinner was fantastic and I never ate the same dinner twice.

This is RIU 5 star at it's best, we have stayed in 2 other RIUs in Cape Verde but this far surpasses them. Worthy of the highest accolade is the assistant manager Rafael who is everywhere every hour of the day from breakfast until way past the evening meals.

The check-in at the hotel was again very efficient and after a welcome drink we went to our room. We requested a pool view room and we were allocated room 4048 which was a brilliant room.

The Main restaurant for breakfast and dinner was buffet self-service and a good standard.

The hotel itself is immaculate and there are always staff cleaning and repairing things. The assistant manager, Rafael, is basically the director of operations and he always seemed to be around.

The reception area is very spacious with plenty of seating, the lobby bar in this area was open from 10.30am until 1.00 am last year. the new times are 9.00am - midnight, Bar Salon 7.00 - midnight, Pool bar 10-00am - 6.00pm, all with a very good waiter service. The pool area is very large with plenty of sunbeds and parasols, you do get a lot of beds reserved and some empty most of the morning, on one occasion two towels on two of the better beds all day never used, must have been reserved by pool staff. You can spend all day on your sunbed with waiters bringing your drinks and not any loud…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Wonderful,"There is so much about this hotel that is wonderful I could be here all day going on about it, my fiancé and I had such a great time in may we are going back in September for another visit. All in all we found the staff and especially the assistant manager Rafael and head waiters (with the red ties) couldn't do enough for us. Only one complaint and its not about the hotel it's about the so called English pub in the centre of Agadir, the price of the drinks are a rip off over £5 a pint in may wont be going there again! I'll stick to all inclusive and go somewhere else for a change on the odd night out!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2013,5,"Lovely hotel, great all inclusive!","Just returned from a 1 week holiday at this lovely hotel for our wedding anniversary. The hotel is super clean, the food is fabulous and the rooms are large and well layer out. The all inclusive is great, branded drinks and champagne included. The food is lovely and the restaurants are kept well stocked and clean all the time. Staff are friendly and speak good English. Despite being said no reserving of sun loungers this was quite bad, we don't normally do this but on this occasion we thought if you can't beat them join them. All in all a great holiday for a well priced week in the sun!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,"Best hotel ever, total Paradise","Went away for a week with friends and stayed at this amazingly beautiful hotel. From the moment we got to the hotel it was nothing but 5* service. The staff are extremely friendly and make you feel so welcome always greeting you with a hello and a warming smile. The hotel is perfect in every corner, with people constantly cleaning and making it look more amazing than it already does. The pool area was extraordinary with the staff always ready and willing to help. The food was fab, the hotel was dreamy and once you're there I guarantee you, you will not want to leave, if I could I'd do the experience all over againn!!!cannot fault this hotel in the slightest, Thankyou tikida palace",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Fantastic Hotel and great value,Read a lot of negative comments and after spending 11 nights there cannot understand why. The hotel is very well kept and there are a lot of staff about keeping on top of maintenance and cleaning pool etc. All of the staff were very polite and friendly with many engaging in conversation and asking how your day was. They often approach you round the pool and try to involve everyone in joining in the activities such as football or volleyball on the beach. The food was fantastic and there was a lot of choice. The restaurant was never too busy and there are plenty of staff to bring you drinks etc. I was also surprised to see that the bars were full of top brand drinks. There wasn't the normal substitute for local drinks. Would definitely recommend to anyone,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,3,The hotel with both a 5 star and 3 star rating...............................,Parts of this hotel are 5 star and parts of it are 3 star; starting with the negative: 3 STAR ENTERTAINMENT: The animation team did their best but the outside acts were sadly lacking. There is a singer sometimes singing to a piano in the lobby bar and sometimes singing with his band in the entertainment room but he was singing the same songs every night and after about an hour both his voice and his songs became very repetitive and everything started sounding the same. On the nights that the singer was in the entertainment room there were bongo drummers in the lobby bar and like the singing this was very repetitive and after a while gives you a headache. 3 STAR FOOD: The food was quite boring and repetitive and on quite a few nights we ended up with pizza and chips as this was…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,4,Good All inclusive,"Reasons to go there are the food which is good for an all inclusive and they have a decent selection which is good if you are travelling with small children as we were. The staff were friendly and would try and help which was nice and you could also get a sunbed fairly easily, the rooms are nicely appointed and are relatively spacious too. Being quite a new hotel they do have some room for improvement however as organisationally they have not quite got it right. Whilst we were there it was windy and the only restaurant open was too small for all the guests which meant queuing for tables and food which failed to be addressed. Little things like soap dispensers not being near to sinks does leave you wondering who thought out the scheme as it is unfortunately impractical. The…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Amazing hotel,"We stayed here end of May 2013 and have to say it is the best hotel we have stayed in over 20 years. Cant understand what some of the complainers expect in life, if you're not satisfied with this place i would like to see how you live at home !! From day 1 the manager was asking how things were and his staff were as attentive and courteous. The hotel, grounds and rooms are well maintained and a pleasure to be in, food and drink is plentiful and varied daily to meet most tastes. Again if people complain about the food i cannot understand why..... There are multiple selections of meats, fishes , salads, soups and endless selection of desserts. Plenty of choice for all and the dining room staff were always on hand with water, wine etc .... your glass was never empty ! At the pool…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Have booked again....,This was our first adventure into Maroc however we have stayed in Riu Hotels previously. Without a doubt this has been one of the most relaxing holidays I have been on for a long time and as a result as soon as we arrived back in the UK we have booked to go back out to the same hotel next year. Firstly having read some of the previous reviews I have to be honest if anything let the hotel down it was the guests on occasion - not having respect for the furniture in the lounge as already stated or assuming that as the chefs have cooked a batch of chicken they should take it all and let the other guests have to wait for more to be cooked... These people don't realise they can go back for more. Transfer between airport and hotel was very quick and check in efficient. Our room was…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2012,5,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at this Hotel for 2 weeks in June/July a Fantastic new Hotel very very nice 5* throughout pool and swim up bar was wonderful and so were the rooms we had paid a little more for a room overlooking the pool well worth the extra money. Been a Palace the service was very good fridge in your room was restocked every day with Beer and soft drinks along with water, all at no extra cost. It was my Husbands 50 Birthday while we were their so a Birthday cake got made and a bottle of Champagne was left for us at Dinner. Food and Drinks were amazing all top brands you even drank Champagne at no extra cost. Cocktails very very good, everyone works hard to make this Hotel a 5*. My only grip was I preferred Marrakesh much more culture Agadir is a lovely place but very commercial ie…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Fantastic Holiday,"Just returned from a weeks holiday at the Riu Palace. Three ladies sharing a beautiful room with great views of mountains/sea etc. Find it difficult to find fault with anything about this hotel. Food, staff, decor, rooms excellent. Any negative points i have would be more aimed at guests than the hotel. Not many children when we first arrived but as the weekend approached more appeared. Babies screaming non stop round the pool and in the bar at night. It was far too hot for them and really not fair on other people. We actually saw people changing dirty nappies and putting them in the pool area bins. The other tiny gripe was the reserving sun bed issue. People must have literally been up in the middle of the night to make sure they got the same spot every day, a bit sad i…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,David B,Visited in May 2013. One of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in. Room was excellent with superb cleaning standards. The choice of food at every meal was sufficiently varied to satisfy eveyone in our party. The pool was regularly cleaned and sitting around the pool was delightful with regular visits from waiters asking us if we wanted drinks. Weather was comfortable as there was a offshore breeze most of the time. We also used the two a la carte restaurants and would particularly recommend the Crystal restaurant as being worth a visit. Staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough to make your visit a pleasure. Only downside was I put on weight during the week I stayed!,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2012,5,Lovely Hotel everything perfect.,"This hotel was pretty new when we went September 2012, lovely rooms great restaurant, pool area very good If you could get a seat! went on the beach most days as it was a bit cooler with a little breeze, someone came around & asked if you required a drink..Lovely seating area of an evening, with shows if you wanted to go to another part.recommend this place.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It has large swimming pool and its own private part of beach with plenty of sun beds on beach and at pool. Staff are fantastic cant do enough for you, food was brilliant and so much choice something to suit everybody . Our room was massive and cleaned everyday to a high standard . The only slightly negative thing we found was the entertainment in the hotel expected it to be better for a 5 star hotel . Agadar resort was ok lovely marine but alot of the new shops were not yet open ,lots of work has has been done there and lots still going on much different now than when i was last there 25yrs ago !!!!

 May 2013,4,"Returned glowing, but tired!","Good points of our holiday – short transfer, good check in and very welcoming, relaxing environment, 24 hour room service, two lovely pools and a Jacuzzi and a good sized indoor pool, locals very friendly, clean beach, branded spirits (but not all the time so it is worth asking), big bedrooms with seating areas and nice bathrooms with powerful monsoon shower, mini bar fridge stocked frequently, champagne on tap as people have mentioned (but I always asked for 'sparkling wine' to be less pretentious, I mean it was hardly Dom Perignon), great a la carte restaurants, cheap spa services, lovely well maintained gardens, nice 'snug' areas dotted around good for couples and privacy, the other guests, mainly French, polite and courteous, great cocktails, good weather apart from two…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

How ever if you did not pay the pool boy every day you would be lucky to get a bed unless you were up at six, The new promanade was good nice views lovely walks. We visited in May as stated in the reveiw from Bedford the Polish did make lots of noise.

 May 2013,5,Fantastic birthday holiday,"We stayed at the Riu Palace from 2nd May until 9th May and would definitely go back there in an instant! I never usually write TripAdvisor reviews but after such an amazing break I thought it was only right that I gave other people my feedback. At the time of booking we paid to upgrade our room to a pool view and I recommend this to anyone as it cost us hardly anything and our room was huge with a lovely view. The restaurants were all fantastic including the a la carte Fusion restaurant which we dined at for the night of my birthday. The staff were amazing and I was even treated to a lovely birthday cake at the end of our meal. The staff were all absolutely amazing, some reviews have mentioned that if you tip them they look after you better but to be honest this is not the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,4,Good for the money!,"This was my second visit to the hotel . . . I first came last August when the sun was scorching hot. The weather this time was much better in terms of temperature . . . I think this is the best tan I have ever had because we could lay out comfortably for several hours each day. To echo other comments this is more 4* than 5* but I have to say that as 'All Inclusive' hotels go this is definitely a good one with a great variety of fresh foods every day and generous measures of branded drinks readily available. Although it is big and was quite busy there are plenty of quiet corners to be found. Avoid the peak meal times and dining in the large 'dinner halls' is a far more relaxing experience. The room was large, clean and very comfortable. The staff in the restaurants and lobby bar…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,I loved it that much I have been back.,"Returned on 08/05/13 from the palace tikida agadir. If you read my previous review you will see that I rate this place highly. I enjoyed it that much the first time I got a bargain offer and went back, along with several other friends and family inc my sister and bro in law who went out in jan just after I returned.. If you want to feel like special for little money this is your holiday.. I shall be back in September..",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,2nd Visit to this Hotel,"This was our second stay in this hotel, we were there last year when it had recently opened and once again we really enjoyed our visit. We arrived at the airport late at night and very quickly retrieved our luggage, however we had to wait on the coach for well over an hour as the rep didn't seem to have a clue who was on the coach or who we were still waiting for. Eventually when there was no-one else coming out of the airport and all the other coaches had departed he decided we could go to the hotel! First time we have had a problem with Thomson's Reps. Once we arrived at the hotel check in was exceptionally quick as there were plenty of staff on to deal with everyone. We were offered something to eat in the main dining room and then went to our room. I had requested a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,4,Good but a let down in some areas,"Stayed here as the 2nd part of a twin centre staying at Riu Tikida Palmeraie in Marrakech (where we stayed for 2 weeks last year). In general this is a very nice hotel and we had a good holiday, but was let down by several minor niggles which were just annoying by the end of our week here. Thomson reps were not particularly great here either. Arrived around 4pm afternoon after long coach journey from Marrakech. Reception said room wasn't ready and to come back in an hour (check in is supposed to be 3pm onwards). We were told to go and have lunch in the restaurant, which took us a long time to find given that we had just arrived. The waiting staff were clearly not impressed that folk were turning up to eat as the lunch service ended and hurriedly cleared all the food away…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Great Hotel,"I have just returned from a weeks holiday with my wife at the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. As with all reviewers I can only give my personal views in as honest a way as possible. We found the hotel to be of a very high standard and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It seemed that the hotel was always being cleaned and everything was permanently tidy. We found all the staff were friendly, helpful and always smiling. This was whether you gave them a tip or not. Our room was on the fourth floor overlooking the pool and also gave us a view of the sea. The room was very quiet and it was only when we actually bumped into the people next door that we realized it was occupied. It was cleaned everyday and the mini fridge re-stocked when needed. The room was large and well equipped with…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 May 2013,4,Another honest review from well travelled Ex-Thomson Rep,"Having worked in tourism for many years my review is honest but maybe I see things a little differently to most people. I also expect a certain standard from a five star hotel. As is often the case it is the other guests that let the hotel down. First of all the negative points: Yes this hotel is beautiful and could well be worth the 5 stars but some of the other disrespectful guests are ruining it for other guests and also the furnishings. It is furnished beautifully in the public areas but already ,after only being open for a year, there are stains and dirt showing on the seat covers,sofas etc. I noticed many people coming up from the pool and beach and sitting down on the lovely sofas and chairs with sun oil and creams on their bodies,it takes 2 seconds to put a towel or…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,3,Nice Holiday don't expect too much help from Thomson,"Visited this hotel last week and was impressed with the way it is kept hygienic and clean,and is a relatively new hotel. As far as the hotel goes: Dining- Two main buffet halls, lacked any atmosphere and too similar to each other, food was of a good standard with a lot of variety, be wary if you are allergic to shell fish as they mix this in with other fish and cold salads sometimes, and the food descriptions are not clear or not even there sometimes, they also refer to beef in general as meat, not chicken. Room - was nice had a balcony and the bath was very homely, bed wasn't very comfortable we had two singles next to each other, and when we pointed this out the simply put a sheet under the bed sheet to make it feel more like one bed. Room service is provided from 10am to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,3,Average,Very nice hotel more of a 4 star than a 5 star. Asked for a quite room on the top floor got a noisey room on the 2nd floor manged to get the room a wanted after 2 days.watch out for wardrobe doors comeing off in your hands lol and dont expect a layin after 8.30 because the cleaners are very loud. .. as for the private beach its a joke you get a public beach with a tiny section for guests.its also not a very nice beach and normaly all you get is sand in your face as its so windy ...if you do come to this hotel make sure you get the top floor with pool view,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The fridge was replenished everyday with beer & soft drinks, and it was a nice surprise to have a kettle & teabags & fresh milk was restocked daily. There was plenty of sunbeds & lovely mattresses to meet all your comforts. The only negative points we found the food was regularly cold to luke warm & we prefer ours piping hot if there had been a microwave I would have warmed it up. Also we are both non smokers & found the smoking area next to the bar quite off putting its a pity it wasn't moved to outside like most European Countries.

 May 2013,5,Superb hotel. One of the best I have stayed in. Food and service out of this world.,We stayed at this hotel for seven nights starting on 13th May after transferring from Marrakech where we had spent four nights on a twin centre break with Thomsons. So glad we experienced both places are they are so different. Marrakech is old and Agadir is only about 50 years old. The Riu Palace is a fantastic hotel and one step up from the Riu Palmerie we had stayed at for the first part of our holiday. When we arrived there was a small issue as we were given a room on the fourth floor overlooking the carpark and smelling very musty. A call to reception quickly resolved the issue. We were upgraded to a pool view room on the ground floor which turned out to be fantastic as we were able to use sun beds on our patio when the wind was blowing near gale force as it did on most of…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Overall excellent,"stayed in April with my extended family, eight of us in total. We had stayed numerous times in their sister property Tikida Dunas and had always enjoyed our stays there. our first bedroom had an overpowering smell of damp but the hotel relocated us to a higher floor fairly quickly so that was not a problem. The room was excellent very comfortable and well appointed. The food in all outlets was very very good. Large buffets with broad choices. the service however is where they score big marks with me. Consistently polite staff all trying to please and all pleasant with it. We were there for seven nights and used all the facilities. we really could not fault anything even if we wanted to. Perhaps the hotel is a bit on the large size for our liking but that is a subjective opinion…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,5,Care with the room,It didn't start well. We arrived late in the evening believing we had a pool view junior suite. We went to our room to find that we had a view of a car park! We protested but no-one seemed to know if we could be moved. In the event our bags arrived at 1.40am and we were asked to talk to reception after breakfast. This we did but still no joy even when we offered to pay for an upgrade(we had already paid for an upgrade to a Junior suite). Eventually we were upgraded for a further charge of 600 Dirham's a night but it was worth it for the view. There is confusion here - some of the trip advisor reviews talk of a pool view but with Thomson they are referred to as sea view. Be very careful what you book. The photos illustrate what a difference there is - either side of the hotel is…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Beware of wet tiled floors,We booked this hotel for our 30th wedding anniversary and were not disappointed. I have stayed in a Riu hotel in Gran Canaria but this one was better. The room/food/pool were brilliant and we were having a great time until half through the holiday when I fell on the way to the pool. I came out of the lift at 9am and saw a cleaner mopping the floor. I could see the floor was damp but nothing prepared me for the way both feet went from underneath me and I landed on my wrist. A doctor confirmed the wrist was broken but the local clinic disagreed. When we flew home three days later I went straight to A&E who confirmed the wrist was broken and I now in a cast and will require physio afterwards. So the moral is BE CAREFUL - this totally avoidable accident ruined what was up till then…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,3,not a good experiance,"we booked this last year and looked at all the reviews so thought it would be the 5 star we were looking for. one arrival at midnight on the 6th may we were greated with a cocktail and the hotel resturant actually open so we could have something to eat that was a great start to this holiday. after that it went down hill. we were given our card to our room and how disapointing that was. all room was described with mini fridges with drinks in at all times. when we arrived there was nothing, no cans and no water for us to clean our teeth with, as i have a medical problem in which i have to take medication half an hour before i eat in the mornings i could not do this without a drink.then there was the story of the wardrobe doors there were none. also be careful with the shelving i…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,3,Luxurious but rooms have issues,"On the whole the hotel is superb. Food, drink, staff and service, cleanliness, decor, setting, views are all excellent and I would imagine it's one of the best that Agadir's beach front has to offer. However, if you are intending to visit here then be warned. It's easy to pick holes in anything, and people's experiences will always vary, so I can appreciate that and will avoid minor trivialities but there are some which are definitely worth noting. Whilst the room facilities, their decor and the bathrooms are an excellent standard, this hotel has been let down by poor planning in it's construction. There is hardly any sound insulation between rooms! Unless you have been assigned a top floor room or a very private suite then it's hardly worth checking in. You can quite literally…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2013,4,Ideal for relaxation.,"Having read previous reviews, I had some doubts about staying here to be honest. Those doubts however soon disappeared once we arrived. The reception area is absolutely huge and decorated to perfection. The hotel is listed at 5 star, however as my partner has stated in her previous review by European standards it is probably more 4 star. The rooms are lovely but ensure you get a pool view preferably on the left wing. The room has everything you need including a hair dryer, but don't get too excited as I could have fanned my partners hair dry quicker lol so I'd advise packing your own. Should you fancy an early night there is a nice modern tv in each room. For the gents out there you need ""panorama"" channel as it has good modern English speaking movies .

 December 2012,5,The Jewel in Agadir’s Crown,"I’ll start this review with the brief we gave to Thomsons – new or refurbished hotel, more adults than children, all inclusive to a very high standard of food and service, good quality drinks, reasonable flight & transfer time, sunshine. They certainly delivered. We booked last minute and travelled to Morocco in December 2012 on the recommendation of the Agent, in search of a long overdue break to enjoy some sunshine, not really knowing what to expect. What we experienced was way beyond our expectations and has now become our number one destination for a return trip.

 April 2013,4,Good Hotel - Relaxing Holiday,I have been reading a lot of the other reviews and I can say each one has valid points. I have traveled a lot and you notice the difference in star ratings in each country. For Morocco this is certainly 5 star however if you have stayed 5 star in middle east for example it doesn't compare. The hotel is lovely and clean and has everything you need but it is missing the 'extra touches'. If you are a young couple PLEASE don't book if you want a lively holiday. It is not the place to over drink and party but if you want a lovely romantic holiday together then this is your hotel. The food is good and you have a lot of choice - IF YOU WANT TO TRY DIFFERENT THINGS. If you are a fussy eater you wont like it. Don't bother with the Gourmet Restaurant if you are not willing to try…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Our room was spotless, the staff were all really helpful and friendly, the only downside was that the bed was very very hard!!! We used the room service a few times which was really good, we put in a few little requests that were not on list and they were very accommodating.We were a little worried about the weather as a few people had said it was cloudy, but usually by 11-11.30 the clouds were gone, on our last day the rain just poured which was a little sad but thats beyond anyones control.

 April 2013,5,Holiday in Agadir,"I travelled with my partner and two friends to the Riu Palace Tikida hotel in Agadir, Morocco. The hotel is exceptional, staff are amazing, food to die for, something for everyone, rooms were very spacious and the overall condition of the hotel was very clean. It has it's own private section on the beach. We went on the 22nd April and the weather was very good. If you are tempted to go there, then you must visit the Souk in Agadir, it is huge and 'yes' although they come out with all the chat like 'cheaper than Asda', '2 for the price of one', if you just browse and then say 'no thank you' they reply with 'no problem, have a nice day'. Do barter, the Rep told us to barter by 75%, it does work.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Pool staff (particularly Ayoub) and waiter (Tarik) are brilliant at their jobs, and were always very friendly. Met some amazing people and couples at the hotel whilst chilling in the bar areas, restaurants and at the pool. Only issues was with the problems of ""bagsying"" a sunbed by the pool by putting a towel on it first thing otherwise you cant get a decent sunbed. Also, a lot of guests seemed to fall ill at some point during their stay for a day or so. We met approx 6 couples who had had the same symptoms (flu-like).

 November 2012,5,You Must Stay Here,"This is a really good hotel. Reception staff are friendly and efficient we were checked in and on our way to our room very quickly. The room was very spacious and had free mini bar stocked with soft drinks, beer and water. There is also tea and coffee making facilities. Room service is available and its free. The maid kept our room spotlessly clean. The public areas are kept spotless staff are always cleaning. The food is great. There was always a good selection in the restaurants. We also ate in the Moroccan and Crystal restaurant which you have to make a reservation in order get a table. We tried everything and never had any problems. The hotel manager and deputy manager were always available to the guests making sure that we were all enjoying the facilities in the hotel.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,4,Lived up to expectations,We spent week 22-29 April at this hotel. We find it difficult to find a location where the weather is reliable in April but this is our second holiday in April in Agadir and last year we went to Marrakech and the weather for all three holidays has been fantastic where every day has been blue skies and sunny with a temperature of 26-28 degrees. General: The lobby is spacious with so many very comfortable sofas. The décor is tastefully done and even if you look closely has been finished to a high spec. All the general areas are kept immaculate and spotlessly clean - especially the toilets. We arrived at the hotel at about 11am. We had been given the hotel cards to fill in on the coach so check in was relatively quick but I would like to point out that most of the people on…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,4,Great Value For Money,"A very impressive reception area which extended into a large seating area for drinks. Extremely high ceilings and such a spacious room afforded a smoking area that was barely noticeable at all. The staff can't do enough to please you however, there seems to be a marginal preference to serving the French first?? Both of the buffet restaurants have an extensive variety of choice and good quality. There are also 2 themed restaurants which require booking a minimum of 24hours in advance. We were amazed that the Krystal Fusion Restaurant was not fully booked constantly. You also get slightly better wine in the feature restaurants. The room was better than expected and very spacious and extremely clean as was the rest of the hotel - spotless.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,The five star reviews aren't wrong,"Stayed at the Riu Palace over Easter 2013 for a week with the family. First impression was of the scale of the reception/bar area, which is a huge four-storey high area, cooly dressed with seating and sculptures, mood lighting and marble. It gave me a feel of an elegant old railway station, with people meeting, drinking, leaving, entering, without it feeling remotely crowded. Staff on the holiday set the tone, polite, attentive, and always available. There is a good balance of efficiency and fun amongst just about all staff. which considering the size of the hotel is pretty good. The facilities include a gym, little used indoor pool, two outdoor pools with jacuzzi etc. Plenty of sunbathing space around the pools (including great settee/cushions area if you are early), an area…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Lovely week away,"Just returned from a weeks stay to the Riu Palace, I travelled with my daughter (23) and a friend. We had a lovely stay in this very nice hotel. The first impressions are very grand with a huge lobby, reception and bar area all of which are sparkling clean and fresh. Check in was ok, and a glass of non alcoholic cocktail juice went down very well. Once checked in we were given directions to our room, which was on the 4th floor. The room was very clean the only problem being that we all sharing and although the spare bed had been made up there was only 2 glasses, cups, towels etc. A quick phone call to reception sorted this out and housekeeping some arrived with all the missing items. The minibar had 3 cans of coke, Fanta, sprite, beer and 3 lots of water in so that was all…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2013,5,What a Honeymoon!,"We chose the Riu Tikida Palace for our honeymoon in March for 10 nights and we are so glad we did! From arriving at the hotel and being greeted with a cocktail to checking out we enjoyed every minute. I had read some of the reviews before we arrived and noticed quite a few that said the age range of the guests was over 50 and wasn't really a hotel for the younger guests. Well we are in our late 20's and saw plenty of couples and families around the same age as us, it just depends what kind of holiday you are after. We wanted to relax in the sun all day with cocktails & enjoy a nice meal & a few drinks at night and this is exactly what we got. If you want loud music playing into the early hours and late night bars then this isn't the hotel for you! The hotel is so beautiful, the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,4,"“Agadir’s Got Talent""","How to judge this hotel? It’s not going to be easy because overall it is very good and offers great value for money yet holds itself out to be 5 stars and then probably doesn’t quite deserve this accolade - difficult! To try and be constructive and helpful let’s consider the various hotel components as being contestants in a talent contest. “Agadir’s Got Talent”. The contestants for this competition being: meet & greet service, housekeeping, entertainment in showroom, entertainment in main bar, reception, bars & bar staff, speciality restaurants, main buffet restaurant, cleanliness, pool & pool areas, gardens, private beach area, management, and overall ambiance & public areas.

 May 2012,4,Holiday in agadir,"We were at this hotel last year. It was disappointing to find that the hotel was not complete on arrival. Having said that the staff did their very best to provide us with professional caring service. The assistant manager ( whose name I forget) was extremely polite. The promenade is brilliant. You can walk along the sea shore and it's a vibrant area. The rooms were extremely clean and we probably were the first guests in he room. The maintenance team sorted out the few ""glitches"" extremely quickly. I am sure that by now the hotel must be fully complete and a truly five star experience",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Beautiful hotel in a wonderful location,"Went for a short break with some girlfriends and was very impressed with the hotel standards. Lots of staff around keeping everything clean and tidy both in the rooms and pool area. The main restaurant had a fantastic selection of food and as well as a great choice on the buffet, there was always something being cooked fresh. Staff extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Will certainly recommend to friends and would love to return with my partner later in the year.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,1st Time All Inclusive,"What a great way to be introduced to All Inclusive. The hotel is very well staffed, only once in the week long stay did the dining room staff seem to be overwhelmed by the volume of diners at peak time. We paid a little extra for a pool view and it was nice to wake up and spend time on the balcony. The grounds were very well maintained and the whole area gave pockets of seclusion so it never felt crowded. We enjoyed relaxing in the bar/lounge area with some live music and of course free drinks. I'm not sure what there is to do in the nearby area, we walked along the promenade to Agadir which was very pleasent, this was a Holiday for us to relax and this hotel complex certainly fitted the bill.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Stunning Hotel! Highly Recommended! Certainly a 5 Star,"My boyfriend and I returned from Morocco today, after spending a fabulous week at the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. If you are thinking about going there, please do, you will not be disappointed. Everything was amazing, we could not fault the food, the rooms or the brilliant staff. Excellent value for money and we met some lovely people - especially Chris and Anne..

 April 2013,5,Lovely Holiday in the Sunshine,"We have just returned from our second visit to the Riu Tikida Palace, The hotel was very good and the Managers are still always on view making sure that everything is just right. The rooms are beautiful, clean, well equipped and spacious. We had our two year old granddaughter with us and all the staff made a big fuss of her. 'Omar' the barman could not have done more to ensure that we were looked after. Our waiter in the main restaurant was 'Redouaine', he was without question the best waiter we have ever had on holiday, the standard of his service and attentiveness was outstanding, nothing was too much trouble for him, he certainly portrayed an excellent image of the hotel as did Omar. I did witness on a couple of occasions one barman, who will remain nameless, being rude about…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Excellent all inclusive option,"This was our first trip to Morocco and this hotel and we were very impressed with the standard of the hotel. Its only a year old and still has a really fresh feel, nevertheless maintenance is clearly taken very seriously, there were often areas being tidied up and repainted without causing any disruption to the smooth running of the hotel. Its a large hotel but not overwhelming and the public areas are very pleasant The food was very good overall, with the usual vast range on offer for breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant and we found freshly grilled fish every day amongst many other tasty offerings. Waiting staff were efficient, hard working and attentive. The large bar area is surrounded by comfortable sofas to relax in after dinner over drinks of your choice, make…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2013,5,Total Relax,"What more can I say about his hotel that hasn't already been said, if you want a fully relaxing holiday this is the place especially out of school holidays. I would not recommend this hotel to people with children, there is a small play area for them but no holiday clubs and nothing for them in the evenings. The food is fab, tip a waiter and sit in his/her area each evening and you will be treated like royalty, the waiters and waitresses are only on about £200 a month so a few dirhams means a lot to them. We were on the 4th floor on the none sunny side of the hotel but found that sitting in the shade after a day in the sun was quite nice and cooling. If its a reasonably priced, hot and relaxing holiday you want don't look any further than this hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,4,Book a pool/sea view room...you will love if when you get there,"We have just arrived back from a fantastic week at this hotel. The hotel is beautiful with one of the biggest reception areas when you arrive. The whole hotel and grounds are spotless, you always see people working to keep the place looking fantastic. The room are very spacious, there was 3 in our room and we never felt like we where on top of each other (all very clean minded!). The maids cleaned the room twice a day and kept the fridge topped up. Room service and breakfast in bed was free, which is always a plus. You could get sun beds everyday by the pool, with a choice of where. But if is April and I am not sure what if would be like in July. We even managed to get a cabana every day with no problem ( but we where out early). The food was plentiful and varied with…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Great for relaxing family holiday,"We are just back from a week at this hotel. We loved it. It is very well decorated, you can tell there has been a lot of thought in the design. Although it is very big, it doesn't feel huge mass tourism. You have so many little corners to keep your intimacy. The big reception area is divided into many little ""living rooms"", it feels like it, it's well divided with tables, lampshades, statues...very relaxing and intimate The same for the buffet restaurant, many tables with division, lamp shades, statues...the noise is not too bad. The staff is lovely always there to bring you anything you ask for. They are so charming with children, especially babies. Our little boy was 8months, and everybody was making a fuss for him. Rooms are big, lovely decorated The pool is big too, not many…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It certainly hasn't spoiled my holiday. Food in the main restaurant very varied and hot!!! Cannot praise the staff enough and it would be unfair to single any out. There are alot of french but if you don't want to see foreigners stay in England! It is five star, I think these people who say it isn't are comparing it to Dubai, Mexico or Maldives standard, it isn't but you pay a third of the price.

The food was consistently excellent and the service was always on point for attending us. As well as the food (of which I am several pounds heavier!) there are several other very positive points: 1) The Bedroom - the suite had a wonderfully comfortable bed and en suite bathroom. Our balcony was in shade throughout the day but we hardly ever used it as we made most of the sun. Always kept spotlessly clean, which was another consistent feature of the hotel as a whole. 2) There were several prime locations for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

In the week managers are around and staff plentiful- always asking if you want a drink and managers checking you are ok; weekends seemed less staff. Food very very good in buffet. The two specialist restaurants could be so much better- you were rushed through the meals- food was lovely, but with small changes they could make it more special- such as waiting until you have finished the main course before asking you what you would like for desert, a longer break between courses.I would have been happy to pay a small supplement to make the night more special. Lunch in beach side restaurant very good, but noisy if you sit inside. People do reseve beds but there were always enough. Pool area great and gardens lovely.

It was my birthday whilst we were there and the hotel even left a happy birthday card and gift in my room. I certainly did not witness any negative treatment either, quite the opposite and we would not hesitate to stay at this property again. There was no bun fight over sun beds (which can ruin your holiday), as they are in abundance, despite the fact that it was only warm enough to go in one side of the pool.

 February 2013,5,Pure Relaxation,My husband and I stayed in this lovely hotel in February 2013 for one week. From the moment we walked through the door there was something different from other hotels. All staff were very pleasant and couldn't do enough for you. The food was very good with a wide selection to choose from. The only down side was that there was not enough sunbeds for everyone and many people left their towels on the sunbeds whilst they went out preventing others from getting a look in. We sat on the beach most times which was lovely but sometimes the wind became too much. The bed was very large which was good but the mattress was a bit too hard. The hotel is quiet a long walk along the promenade to the harbour but this a relaxing walk especially if you walk along the beach.,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2013,5,Fantastic Holiday!,"We stayed at the hotel between 21st March - 1st April and it was amazing! The pool area was very spacious, I did wish that the pool where the pool bar was would have been heated as it was too cold to swim in that pool (2 pools but only 1 heated). There is also a lovely indoor pool area. The weather was very good, we had one day of rain and often it would be cloudy but that would burn off so plenty of sunbathing time (around 27 degrees most days but was cold in the evening you had to wear a jumper/cardigan). It was windy at times but around the pool area there were sections where you could get a wind break. There is a beach restaurant for your lunch, main buffet for dinner with also a choice of booking the Moroccan and Krystal restaurant. I prefered to main buffet areas for…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2013,5,A superb hotel! Highly recommended.,"Well me and my fiancée just got back from staying for a week at the Riu and had a superb time. I'll start by saying we are both British and didn't witness any negative treatment as suggested by the recent review I just read by Seeb08 (one review..hmmm..)- everyone was treated as equals as far as I was concerned. The hotel is super clean, service was top notch and the heated outdoor pool was lovely. We went to the local Souk and did the Agadir tour which was interesting and managed to haggle for a few items. This is probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in- big, clean rooms with a lovely pool view, minibar fully stocked, food was superb in my opinion- anyone that can't find anything delicious to eat must be the fussiest person in the world (I'm pretty fussy myself).

Food consists of basically pizza and chips. No entertainment. The manager promises you the earth at the welcome meeting but when we tried to talk to him he told us ""to be quick"". Staff are rude and basically ignore British tourists. Felt uncomfortable that they all asked if we were Indian an then ignored us for rest of holiday. Sea was filthy with condoms floating around. Not enough sun beds and people reserve them so early you don't even get a bed! Unless your over 60 years old DO NOT stay here!! If your British...

We have stayed in 5 star golf hotels in Belek Turkey and this is as good as any of those hotels. The service is impeccable. Rooms are beautiful. We paid for a pool view which was lovely and we could see the sea too. Can't believe anyone is giving poor reviews, must be very fussy. So much choice at meal times. Buffet restaurant is well laid out. Haven't tried the other bookable restaurants yet but they look lovely. Pool area very large and plenty of beds. Lobby area is lovely to sit in.

Essentially this is a good hotel but Thomson and going places ( aka TUI) have deployed a "" pack em in mentality"" thus resulting in this hotel buckling at the seams when in comes to such things as offering good service. The hotel simply cannot cope with so many people , in particular elderly French who are rude and demanding and a predominance of obsese people who spend 4 hours trying everything on the buffet menu thus resulting in long waits for other guests. This after they have laden their towels at 0630 hours meaning the rest of us can never get a poolside seat and thus have no access to endless waiters serving to their…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

It's design is beautiful, they have spared no cost on the decoration. The lobby is really impressive and rather than be the dead space they normally are this is constantly filled with people. The main bar is in one corner and the restaurant in the other so it becomes quite a focal point. Lots of lovely sofas to chill out on. On the down side a main area of the bar is still a smoking area.

We arrived at the hotel and was welcomed with a drink which is always nice. Our room took a little time as we arrived early which is understandable, but were given wrist bands (thumbs up) as we were on a all inclusive package to avoid anyone stopping us. Reception Staff: Very nice and great money exchanging service (very good rates) but not up to scratch with their english - for example asking for shower gel in our room ended up with the maintenance man coming up trying to fix the shower.

As for the 'wow' factor, well that must be the staff. They work incredibly hard, are always attentive, pleasant and very grateful if you tip them, but they certainly aren't hanging around in expectation. In fact, you have to be quick or they are onto their next job! The affable managers eat in the restaurants and have a visible presence in the hotel throughout the day.

I have thought hard about what to write about this hotel as all the previous reviews to this one i feel are fairly accurate. I have to agree that the rooms, pool and grounds are to a five star standard and for an all inclusive the food was excellent with variety and did not become repetitive. The hotel is continually being cleaned and their is a lovely feel to the hotel. The majority of the guests are in their prime so entertainment i feel is aimed towards them bingo, boules, yoga, pool aerobics, Arabic lessons etc. The entertainment team did try to get some of the holiday makers to play volleyball but with little success.

The flight with Thomson was great, no delays, pick up from airport was great, and the transfer was only a little over 30 minutes. There were a lot of check ins on our arrival but was all dealt with quickly and efficiently, with a welcome drink. Our cases were taken to our room, they actually were there waiting for us.

The only negative point of our vacation were the restaurants which are huge, with hundreds of guests eating at the same time, very noisy and the food rather uninspring. We have stayed at the RIU Dunas which is a 4* star all-inclusive hotel and the quality of food has been equal.

Staff are lovely and very friendly/helpful, although can take up to 10 mins to get served at the bar at times as they tend to favour the old couples! The bar shuts at 12AM which I find a little ridiculous at an 5*all inc, as there is nothing else to do in the resort on a night 12AM basically means bedtime. For 90% of the people staying at the hotel this isnt a…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 April 2012,5,Fantastic,"I'm so glad to see the reviews are still excellent . My husband and I stayed here in April 2012 when it had just opened and I never did get round to write the review! We had a fantastic time and although there were a few minor problems due to just having opened , everything we asked for was rectified. We had the most reading time enjoying the wonderful food! The staff were all friendly and helpful and the hotel was spotless! We loved it so much we are returning in October 13 and we are really looking forward to our stay.

 March 2013,5,Deserves all of it's 5 stars,"AGADIR Travelled with Thomson 4 nights Marrakech/7 nights Agadir (4 - 15 March) After a transfer from Marrakech which took 4 hours instead of the promised 3, in an elderly mini-bus without functional seatbelts or aircon on the warmest day of the holiday so far, I was already in a poor mood when our driver dropped us at the bottom of 2 flights of steps at the hotel entrance. I had to kick up a bit to get a porter to carry our bags up and the final straw was being told at reception that our room wasn’t ready. It was well past 3pm (check-in time) and, being by this time hot, sweaty and tired, I was not best pleased! However, a few sharp words prompted a small miracle and suddenly our room (or somebody else’s?) WAS ready. From then on our holiday really was 5*……. SUITE – we had…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is immaculate, as are the rooms and the grounds.The staff are attentive, friendly and realy can,t do enough for the guests. 'All inclusive' here, means exactly that, their is food and drink in abundence, where and when you require it and with few limitations. The food is excellent and very varied, catering greatly to European tastes and there dosen,t seem to be the same restrictions on types of alcoholic drinks that you normaly find in North African hotels. The hotel is large and spacious and can easily accommodate a large number of guests without appearing crowded. The swimming pools and gardens, to the rear of the hotel,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2013,5,Lovely Winter break,"This Hotel came up with a first for me when we had our meeting with the Rep, the key members of staff of all departments were there to introduce themselves and to tell us that if we needed anything they were more than happy to help. The hotel is great, Large rooms, very good food with a variety of cuisines, very friendly staff. Everything you could ask for. The trip to the souk was very interesting as was the cultural evening we went on, a short coach ride away, with local dancers, acrobats, fire eaters The dancers entertained us as we ate, in a large tent , we then went outside for the rest of the show",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 March 2013,5,Excellent hotel totally living up to it's Trip Advisor recommendations.,"There's little to add to the feedback of previous reviewers. The hotel is spacious, luxurious and spotlessly clean. I was astounded at the continual cleaning that took place not just in the main hotel areas but the patios, pool area, protective screens - just simply everything. All the staff were absolutly marvellous - friendly, efficient, humourous and totally professional. The food was first class with an amazing choice and the food that was cooked at the various stations was cooked in small batches so it was always fresh. At breakfast the table cloths were changed for every new guest sitting down regardless of whether they were marked or not.

When we wereshown to our room we were very disappointed at the view and daylight from our balcony, however reception staff soon found an alternative which was better, still not a great view but able to see the sea as opposed to a wall!

 February 2013,4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Having never been to Morocco before, I didn't quite know what to expect. The markets and shop owners are the same as other north African countries, doing their level best to coax you into their store. But all very pleasant. The sea front at Agadir was far better than I expected. A beautiful promenade leading to a pretty marina with the way lined with shops and restaurants. The whole area had been rebuilt after an eathquake in 1960 and is of pure tourist style. The outer areas of the city are more run down and as you would find in most mediterranean and north african countries. The Riu Palace was a superb hotel. It is quite newly built, 1-2 years old I believe. The rooms were a very good size and the maid service just fine. Due to the size of the hotel, the dining rooms were…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Bed was large and very comfy even though it was a firm mattress, which we found suitable for both of us. The room was very well maintined and very clean.

FOOD We have visited RIU Clubhotels before and always enjoyed the experience but this RIU PALACE was a notch above any of them, especially with regard to food.

Hotel should allocate more staff during busy times. The weather wasn't the best for the time of year but the hotel provided ample facilities to overcome this. It's very open-plan so when it rained, floor tiles became slippery when wet; staff did their best to dry them off and credit to them. Food quality was good, Krystal restaurant not so; needs improving. Long corridors made for noisy guests, not everyone is considerate.

Public areas are vast and well furnished with large, comfortable sofas and chairs. Attention to finer detail is what makes this hotel stand out against other, inferior ones. The pool area is well supplied with sunbeds, though this unfortunately does not prevent people from reserving 'their' beds hours before they actually use them. The staff are all very friendly and work hard be it in the restaurant, around the pool or cleaning. The food is varied and plentiful, the staff making sure it is regularly replenished.

We had a pool view (worth the upgrade £70) as you can see the sea too....try and get on floor 3 or 4 for the best views. The Hotel Assistant Manager Raphael was absolutely superb. He welcomed us personally, was on hand throughout our stay; probably the best manager and customer service I have experienced. The hotel is the newest one along the seafront and in my opinion the best one and most modern. It is spotlessly clean, food is excellent and great variety. Additional Gormet restaurants are OK, you need to book them, but as the main one is so good, they are not really necessary.

The food in the Fusion Restaurant however is slightly odd e.g. Pea soup with ice-cream!! The Roxy Band were excellent and the in house entertainment team did a very good job. Quite windy off the Atlantic so take some warm clothing but surprisingly hot and easy to get burnt. Good promenade for walks but do not expect any cafes or bars until near Agadir center 45 mins away.

The rooms are very good, spacious and mostly comfortable (slightly hard mattress for our taste). We had a room on the second floor 2125 to be exact with no pool view, but which did mean that our balcony did get the sun (when it came out)! Food was always excellent. We were both very impressed with this as there were apparently over 800 guests when we were there, and I would imagine this to be quite a feat in itself.

The buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner were great. Always plenty of choice and good quality, however they were really busy and drinks service hit and miss. We visited the fusion restaurant twice and although the service and food were really good the limited menu didn't change. However to be fair the service was spot on.

Believe me, we have 6-7 luxury holidays per year and normally stay in international 5 stars hotels like Westin, Shangrila, Hilton all over the world. We were blown away by staying in this hotel, our first time all inclusive stay. We love the management who were always around. They really know what customer needs are about.

 February 2013,5,Great stay,"I went with my children (3) and wife for the first time to Morroco. Agadir is a quiet place next to the beach. The hotel is fantastic and the service too. The pool area is a paradise and the all inclusive is top since they offer good brands on drinks and the food is out of this world. You can have dinner at the buffet or reserve a table at one of the tow restaurants (free) inside the hotel. Concerning the area, I recommend HIGHLY the market (I think called SOUK) but go to the first one where all the locals go (and tourists) and not to the one that the hotel offers with free transport. The taxi costs 50 dirahn about 5 euros or if you are only 2 people take the red small cabs for only 20 dirhan about 2 €.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 February 2013,5,Excellent base for Winter Sunshine,Five star and All Inclusive? Is such a thing possible? It all depends on what 5 star means to you - if this is exclusivity and small scale fine dining well it probably isn't a 5 star for you. For the rest of us mere mortals it does a pretty good impression of 5 star luxury whilst offering a large selection of quality food and drink mainly in a buffet environment. You can choose the two a la carte restaurants that were open whilst we were there for no extra charge. Both gave you a taster of top level service and exclusive dining. I'm not sure the food there was for me but that was down to personal taste not quality. It is possible to eat far too much at any restaurant here - that may be a problem for you!!

The beds around the pool were really comfortable and we never had a problem getting one. If we didn't want to sit by the pool there was a number of comfortable sofas on a terraced area…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2013,4,pleasant surprise,"went to riu palace feb4th, we booked a few days before leaving simply because we had had enough of the rubbish weather. we were not to sure about Morrocco as we were not too keen on North Africa, we couldn't have been more wrong.The hotel was of a very good standard, the rooms lovely the only problem we found was that the towels were not changed every day even the dirty one's, one of which was continually folded and put back even though we left on the floor in desperation. Other than this minor issue the staff were pleasant, the drinks branded and the food of a very good standard in the buffet.The food in the 2 a la carte were very ordinary although the surroundings were very nice, I think that these need some attention but we still enjoyed our evening. The pool area was very…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 February 2013,5,"Amazing Holiday, amazing hotel!!","We went to Agadir at the start of Feb for a week of winter sun at a reasonable cost and saw this new hotel with positive reviews. We booked this with a little reservation but need not have worried we had the most amazing time. The hotel was well set out and we were checked in straight away and given a welcome drink. We went to our room which was a superb size large beds, flatscreen tv, separate area for wardrobes and then a large bathroom with a powerful waterfall shower (Big Plus for us). The pool area was spacious always able to get a bed which all had thick matresses on to not feel like you are lying on the wood. There was a good bar with friendly staff and branded drinks. On the food front we were always able to get something to eat if we wanted at any time including room…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2013,4,Very good - would certainly book again,"A very well situated hotel, right on the beach - just across from the promenade and close to shops, a little supermarket, some restaurants and a pharmacy across the road. Always an excellent choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner in the buffet restaurant. The staff are outstanding - always willing to help and to offer a smile. Tried the 2 A la Carte Restaurants, which again were very good. The dress code is strictly adhered to - we watched someone in swimming shorts turned away from the restaurant one evening. Cleanliness is outstanding, as in all Riu Hotels. Room excellent - spacious and very well equipped. Housekeeping always excellent. Lounge - excellent plenty of comfortable sofas and armchairs.

 October 2012,5,Fabulous Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel as a two centre stay following on from the Riu tikida at Marrakech, in October, the weather was fabulous. We knew as soon as we set foot into the lovely reception area and were met with cocktails that this was superior to the hotel in Marrakesh which we had enjoyed. The hotel room was lovely, we paid a small amount extra for a pool view which was lovely but depending on which side of the hotel you are on you may not get the sun in the afternoon which was not important to us but may be to those of you who like to sit on your balcony and sunbathe. There were plenty of sun loungers by the pool, plenty of choice where to sit. The food and red wine in the main restaurant is very nice and plenty to choose from. We tried the Italian and the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 February 2013,5,Excellent relaxing holiday,A fabulous clean friendly hotel. Too beautiful to let people smoke inside which meant as non smokers this spoilt our enjoyment of that otherwise a brilliant location and holiday.

 January 2013,4,SMOKERS PARADISE!,"We are very tolerant of smoking, however all the large bar area and part of the beautiful lounge area was smoking. As it was all open plan it didn't matter where you sat it was smokey, at times in the evening when you walked in to the lounge there was a smog hanging over the bar area. To help clear the smoke the patio doors were opened ,but with outside temperatures of around 7c it made it drafty & cold and the air was still not clear. It may be less of an issue in the Summer. As other reports say the hotel is indeed beautiful, the manager and assistant manager are always around and very helpful, the staff without exception are very friendly, the service is great, lovely rooms, good food and excellent outside areas with plenty of sunbeds.

I travelled with my daughter (24) and was looking for a week away, just doing nothing, but relaxing and thats what we did. All the staff were smiley and couldnt do enough for you. The drinks were all branded at no extra cost, food at all the meal times was fantastic and I am really fussy, but still managed to find lots to eat. Our room was very spacious - perhaps the best room that I have stayed in. All the animation team were very friendly, but not in your face. Entertainment - in the lounge bar area was great before going for dinner and the Shows were also very good. We will be going back... Duty Free - Dont make the mistake I made.

The food was great and plenty of choice for the fussy eaters! the rooms are large modern and the mini bar (FREE) is re stocked daily. The day spa is top class and reasonably priced for all things beauty (i had a 50 min Massage) for 30 euro approx. Id recommend this hotel over all others in Agadir including the fabled Sofitel..

The hotel is obviously still very new, but the gardens have already matured well and it's looking stunning. The hotel is well located on the seafront, with easy walks to the marina approximately 2 miles easy flat walk with lots to see en route. There are several shops/ bazaars located directly outside of the hotel with some hard haggling there are some great things to buy. Just around the corner there is a fixed price ""supermarket"" which sells most of the goods that you see at the bazaars but is a lot less hassle with the price being fixed, this also gives you a good guideline of the price!

 October 2012,4,Great hotel,"We stayed for one week at the end of October. Lovely hotel with great friendly staff, especially the food waiters. Always made a fuss of our son, asking his name talking about football etc. The weather was not good and as a result there's not an awful lot to do. However, can imagine when the sun shines you don't have to move far from the hotel. Not very impressed with Agadir itself and as a result would not go back. But to reiterate the hotel and staff are lovely, just cross your fingers for sun!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 January 2013,5,A lovely hotel for a winter break,"We stayed at the Riu Palace between the 14th and 28th of January, The hotel was absolutely first class. The rooms are very nice, spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean. The hotel itself is sumptuously designed with lots of comfort in the public areas. The staff were very friendly and very attentive, Samira was our regular waitress and she was brilliant, the bar staff were always looking to top us up when our glass neared being empty. The entertainment staff were great fun and again were very friendly. The quality and choice of food was very good.

From the minute we walked into the hotel we were greeted with a warm friendly welcome from the staff. We were bowled over by the choice of food, the cleanliness of the rooms and the amount of care from the cleaners in our room was just brilliant. Friendly waiters/waitresses, bar staff and chefs.

 January 2013,5,Second Visit.,"This was our second time at this 5 star hotel and must say far better than our last visit which was very good. The animation team put on some good shows through our two week stay. Also some of the outside entertainment was excellent. Music most nights. The staff at this hotel are very friendly and look after your every needs. The food in the restaurant was to a very high standard and if anyone complained about it I would like to know why, because the variety was very good at all meals. The Krystal Fusion restaurant was excellent with waiter service. Nice to be waited on at times. Everyone at the hotel was always smiling and willing to help you in making the holiday a memorable one.

Staff always smiling, welcoming. And they were doing it in a way that wasn't intrusive or annoying. Just very genuine, attitude free customer service. The weather was really good too at this time of year although it did get nippy at night. Managed to escape the snow and got a very good deal on this place. It is definitely better than the other Riu hotels there so I would recommend over the others. Food was of very good quality in the main dining areas and quite a variety of tastes catered for. You are also able to pre-book the 'A la carte' menus a day or two in advance. As it is 5 star, do make a bit of an effort for dinner. Guys should cover below…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The cleaning staff were always on the go. The selection in the restaurants were amazing. Food was being served from 7.30 in the morning till 10.30 pm ie an early breakfast and if that was missed then continental was served, then lunch then afternoon tea, then finally dinner..

 January 2013,5,So exceeded our expectations,We booked this for a Christmas break .. Three couples for ten days over Xmas and new year ... Was a bit worried reading some of the reviews ... As I had picked the hotel ... However I can honestly say this hotel thoroughly exceeded all expectations. The staff were tremendous and Raphael the manager always seemed to be on duty ... Always a smile on his face and so helpful. All of the staff are so customer orientated. The pool area was fantastic with copious areas of sitting and lounging.

The staff are all so lovely and the service is brilliant. We tipped one particularly pleasant waiter on our last day and he was so grateful! The food in the main restaurant was always of a very high standard in my opinion, especially the tagines in the evening, mmmm - although the Krystal restaurant was a let down, I wouldn't bother going in there again as the atmosphere wasn't very relaxed and the food wasn't as good as the main restaurant. Ah well, you have to try these things! Pool is fantastic, plenty of sunbeds (yes, it might be a good idea to reserve a spot but we didn't always do this and always found a space) The drinks selection was amazing!

 January 2013,4,Watch out for security weakness,"This is a great hotel. The junior suite we had was huge. As it was seaview, it was right on the beachside, so a good long walk to reception and main restaurant! Also, be aware that the balcony can be in a strongish breeze for most of the day.The meals were great, mostly freshly prepared in front of you. The staff were helpful and friendly. Everywhere spotlessly clean. Pool area is pleasant, well-sheltered from the breeze and there are plenty of loungers (in January!) We felt the hotel let itself down by two events. Firstly, we moved rooms at our request after two nights and discovered that the keycard to the old room actually opened the second room, without being reprogrammed!! When the deputy manager was told this, his answer was that it was impossible!! We used that key all…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,Better than we expected !,we booked this trip as a last minute winter getaway and after reading some of the reviews i was a little doubtful as to what we would expect. To say the least - we were not disappointed. The food was amazing both in the buffet restaurant and the a la carte dining options. The Morrocan was simply amazing. The staff and waiters were all on hand to help your every need in the buffet restaurants at lunch time and at evening meal times.The pool was very modern with a heated Jacuzzi and swimming pool (although the swim up bar pool - wasn't heated... go figure!!). The rooms were extremely spacious and more than adequate for the two of us. Mini-fridge was restocked almost daily but at least every other day.

Yes it is 100% 5 star (yes I have stopped in many hotels from 2 star up to 6 star). The staff were very present and attentive , if you stood at the bar for longer than a minute somebody would be there to take your order and bring it to your table. The food in the restaurant is as good as any all inclusive I have ever been to, I think the people who complain about the food need to remember that an all inclusive hotel is cooking for hundreds of people and have to cook the food to the liking of the majority.

We have never stayed at a Riu hotel before but have heard good things about the standard, so hoped that we wouldn't be disappointed, well what can I say this hotel by far exceeded our expectations. The hotel itself is beautiful, the reception and bar area very specious with lots of great sofa's to enjoy drinks and coffee.

 September 2012,4,Not quite a five star,"Had a lovely stay here with ample drinks and some good food. Grounds were immaculate rooms are large and clean, in fact the hotel generally is very good. The two letdowns were the dirty beach area and the service in the restaurants. For a five star I expect a lot better. Also my wife's kindle was stolen by some unsavoury guest. That aside a good visit but will go to the Dunas or tikida beach next time.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,One of the best hotels I've stayed in,"This hotel is something everyone should see - put it on your bucket list! From start to finish, it was magnificent. We arrived on 27th December 2012, mid afternoon, for 7 nights - the reception we received was amazing; we were advised to leave our luggage in the coach (the next time we saw it was when we came back later after eating), we were directed to our room and WOW - it was fabulous - luxury all the way. Clean, sumptuous and extremely comfortable. The number of staff to look after guests almost outnumber the guests; cleaners, waiters, gardeners, security, everyone with a smile night and day. The food was fantastic - I can be quite fussy about what I eat but the choices available 24 hours a day surprised even me. The number of bars, well, I stopped counting. The hotel is…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2013,5,Really a pleasure to visit,"Just returned from one glorious week at the Riu Palace in Agadir courtesy of a Thomson all in package. Cannot recommend highly enough. Beautiful hotel in spacious grounds built around a well designed pool area which never felt claustrophobic even with an over 65% occupancy in the hotel. Luxurious room with every facility. The hotel is fairly new so everything looks and feels that way. Food was also excellent and well served by great staff. In fact all the staff at every level were both courteous and charming. The bar serves a really good selection of cocktails and the ""special"" nights in the Moroccan and international restaurants should not be missed. Added to which the buffet offers great cuisine every night. Thomson should be proud to represent this hotel and the Riu group…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 January 2013,5,Best holiday ever! 31/12/11 - 07/01/13,"To put it blunt my stay here was fabulous! The palace truly is a palace from the decor to the service. I stayed here with my partner and daughter 8 months, we were apprehensive as we are 25 years of age and wondered if the hotel would be full of the older clientele... We shouldn't have worried there was plenty of English to make us feel at ease and all the staff and most of the geusts were lovely, the French and Moroccans were so sweet with our daughter and management spoke to us every evening to see that are stay was going well! Pool amazing and was heated to a perfect temp and there was always a sunbed spare regardless of what time we went down to the pool. Rooms are spotless and cleaned every day and were like a home from home we watched a film every evening as unfortunately…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,Xmas and New Year holiday,"As already said, this Hotel really is very nice. We found the Waiters, Cleaners, Bar Staff , Reception and Management very obliging and nothing was too much trouble.. My husbarid tripped over one of the coffee tables and cut his hand and the Manager and Assistant Manager (no less) tended the cut, you wont get that everywhere. The food was excellent and we still managed to find something different to eat after two weeks.. We had a pool view room on 3rd floor and we could also see the Sea. Just one complaint about the room, we paid £140 extra for the upgrade to pool view but as the balcony didnt have railings but a brick front we couldnt see the pool whilst sitting down which was a bit annoying. We had to stand to see what was going on! Saying that, there were balconies…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,5* Christmas/New Year.,"We visited RIU Palace in July, (see review, Wow,But). The hotel was excellent, but as we normally spend Chritsmas in the Canneries, but decided to return to Morocco, and the Palace,the only concern was the weather?. Well the weather was excellent, with the sun rising every morning just after 8am and setting over the sea just after 6pm. Did not see a cloud in the 2 weeks, we were there. The day time temp reached 22-26c, and the evening night temp dropped to 15-10c, so a jumper, requried for the evenings, but this meant a good nights sleep. Add to that one swimming pool is heated to 28c, and plently of sun loungers to go around, meant all day spent by the pool, with waiter drinks service included, what more do you want. A lot of reviewers have decribed the facilities at the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,"Proper 5 star, really enjoyed","This really was a happy surrise to find. To start with the rooms are very spacious, really well kept and give a nice base for the holiday A mini bar is restocked daily free of charge, with cans of coke and fanta and sprite and beer. The food is excellent really. You have the main buffet for Breakfast, with lovely omelettes made to order, sausages, bacon, several variety of egg, fruit, breads etc. Lunch is in the restaurant towards the beach. Again, a great variety, my partner is very picky, but always found something tasty. For dinner we had the choice of the main buffet, which had some excellent options, including roasts, tagines, fresh pasta etc. Or you can dine in either the Moroccan or the Fusion. The moroccan was very good indeed but the fusion didn't quite work. Not bad…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,Excellent winter sunshine destination,"Hotel is situated right on the seafront where there is a really nice promenade on which you can stretch your legs. The evening sunsets are to die for! Hotel is spotlessly clean and has some of the most friendly staff we have come across in out travels. The assistant managers, especially Rafael, are continually present in the hotel and the dining room and are always willing to pass the time of day with you and listen to your Riu Palace holiday experience. The rooms are superbly fitted out, although as mentioned by other reviewers there is a definite lack of drawer space. High floors are nice and if you like sunshine on your balcony and a pool view you need even numbered rooms 2 - 64. Food in the buffet restaurants is nicely presented but as with all buffet food some of it could…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,Suited us!,"We were very keen to get some winter sun to cheer us up and we normally go away in October rather than over Christmas and New Year. We spent three days in Marrakesh prior to arriving in Agadir for 7 days. I was also keen to be able to do some exercise whilst we were away to fight off the inevitable excesses of the all-inclusive as I do a bit of running and have a race (foolishly a half marathon) the day after we got back. The hotel was absolutely beautifully laid out, the attention to detail is exceptional and the armies of staff ensure that you are well looked after and the hotel is spotless. We got a fantastic room, nice bathroom, decent view, comfy - well stocked all-included fridge. The food was lovely - the pool area fabulous. The gym/fitness is the only disappointment,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,ALL ROUND EXCELLENCE AND SERVICE,"Just back from 7 nights at this wonderful hotel, as mentioned the food can be deemed 'the same' but if you took the time to go around the various serving stations you could have different meals all week. Maybe some people go straight for the pizza and chips section and dont see the wonderful Moroccan Tagine dishes each night..........I digress. We had the benefit of staying in a suite which was as big as our humble house back home. Service in the room was good and the room spotless when we arrived back in the afternoon, to be honest some folk have complained about tiles and fittings breaking but this hotel is only 9 months old and is surely due some snagging from the Moroccan builders, we saw some large tiles fall off at breakfast behind one of the food staions but this was due…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,"Agadir, Good; Hotel, Better; Staff, Best!","Before my week’s stay at the Riu Palace, I presumed that the ‘Poor’ and the ‘Average’ reviews on here would be more informative than the larger number of ‘Excellent’ ones; the graver the words, the more honest the speaker. In fact, the critical two and three star reviews stuck in my head, as I left Gatwick for Agadir, slightly unsure of whether the Riu Palace was the right choice. However, having now spent a week there, I am forced to find fault not with the hotel, but with these dissatisfied reviewers. I loved the Riu Palace. One fellow-reviewer – ‘BirdieS’ - who posted on the 5th November 2012 – said that he/she was annoyed with the: ‘very clueless staff’, ‘the ill-thought-out rooms’, [the absence of a] ‘DVD player’, ‘no individual bottled toiletries’, the ‘little too cold’…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Absolutely fabulous hotel, staff so friendly nothing was too much trouble, food lovely bit same same after a week but I think you would be hard pushed not been able to find anything you didn't like, drinks fab and well flowing champagne especially nice ! Rooms were fab, like having a suite separate seating area, separate toilet and bidet, fantastic shower and bath, twin sinks.

 December 2012,5,excellant value,"Stayed at this hotel 3rd December for two weeks with my wife.Hotel is 5 star and well worth its rating.The staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful,nothing was too much trouble for them.The rooms were very spacious and clean there was a mini bar which was kept topped up with beer and soft drinks.The food was exceptional whether you ate in the main restaurant or the two special restaurants.You can seriously put weight on at this hotel.Unlike other places we have been at which were all inclusive the drinks here were normal branded,ie gordons gin jack daniels etc.The wine in the main restaurant was the only let down.If you book for the other two restaurants the wine is much better.There was evening entertainment which was very good.Outside there were two pools and a bar.There…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2012,5,very nice hotel,"stayed here after 2 nights at the tikida dunas (which is poor). Hotel is modern and very well done, all the public areas are nice with lots of seating indoor and outside. I liked the style in which hotel was done. Bedrooms also very nice and well designed. Liked pretty much everything about them. Food was good at both the main buffet and poolside buffet at lunchtime. The ""special"" gormet style fusion meal was very nice indeed, although we found it a bit tricky to find the person who books the special restaurants. Would stay again for sure. I was addicted to morrocan mint tea before i left.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 November 2012,5,TOP CLASS,"Stayed for a week in early Dec having been moved (by choice) from sister hotel nearby while there was building works going on. Absolutely stunning. Best hotel I ever stayed in during a package hotel (and there have been many). Beautiful grounds, spacious rooms with fantastic bathroom, especially the hot power shower and separate wc/bidet. Lovely, stylish public areas, perfect service from all the staff from groundsmen to reception, someone even came by to sort out a wifi access issue for my son. Great food, loads to choose from all through the day and into late evening. Private beach a few steps from the guarded entrance (very low key), leading also to the Promenade which ran the full length of the beautiful sandy beach to Agadir marina.

 December 2012,5,"Very, Very Good Hotel","We stayed at this hotel for a week commencing 17th Dec 2012. It was the first time we have ever been on an ""All Inclusive"" basis, and were a little anxious about the standards of the food and drink supplied. We need not have worried; the quality of both were excellent. In addition, the staff were very efficient and friendly, and the management make themselves available throughout all parts of the hotel to help, or advise, (Raphael was particularly helpful during our stay). The room (ours was a standard) was spacious and kept clean by the housekeeping staff, plus the minibar was refilled every two days (mineral water being the most important item), though if extra top-ups were needed, these could be had by simply 'phoning Reception. The guests were mostly French (60% - 70%)…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 August 2012,5,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 weeks in August. The Hotel is beautiful, the rooms even though standard were like a junior suite in most hotels!

 September 2012,5,Great stay.... just a new tweaks required for Excellent,"Great stay back in September. Reception was lavish, rooms excellent, pool and pool bars very good and based just on that we'd go back tomorrow. Unfortunately we have to wait until June-2013 until we return. It was obvious that the hotel had got a lot better that it's opening months, when it was dying on Trip Advisor, and to be honest almost all of those gripes had gone away by the time we visited, but a few still remain. 1. Booking for the Fusion Resturant was a shambles, always apparently booked, but with tables empty every night, which was lucky as they lost our booking, but we were still able to eat there that night. Even better was that the food was to die for, surroundings greate and the staff excellent. Well worth the visit if you can get a booking. 2. Towels on…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We were always seeing cleaners at work in the hotel, and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The waitors and waitresses went above and beyond when asked for something on or off the menu! The reception were a bit slow when we asked for things to be sent to the room- when we came down with stomach bugs, we had to wait in ALL DAY to be seen by the resident doctor, and then being sent up food and drink took ages too.

 November 2012,5,Excellent stay at Riu Tikida Palace,We have just returned from a wonderful two week holiday (22nd November - 6th December) at the Tikida Palace. Our son and his fiancee joined us for 1 week and they also had a brilliant time there. We totally agree with all the positive remarks made about this hotel and honestly cannot understand the negative ones which have been made - but each to their own opinion. We felt that all the facilities at this hotel were 5 star. On the day we arrived our flight was the only one and it meant that it didn't take very long before we were on the coach and ready for our transfer to the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel we were checked in at reception by Mustapha - this young gentleman was extremely courteous and helpful in giving us all the information we needed to know for our stay at…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,5,Fantastic,We stayed in this hotel back in July for 11 nights as a family with 2 teenagers and I can honestly say it was the best holiday ever. The hotel is stunning and yes it was new so still some work/snagging going on but it never bothered us they kept noise to a minimum. The buffet food was amazing and we ate in the Krystal Fusion twice and the Moroccan restaurant once while there and loved them both. In the lobby bar you could get champagne and the barmen are pretty good at remembering what you drink. All drinks were branded too so that was nice. I managed to find out what a latte was so had a few of them from the pool bar. We never went down early for a lounger and always found 4 for our family. We never tipped the pool guys either to reserve ones for us. We had a pool view on…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,5,Wow!!,"Hi All Just returned on the 4th December. What a wonderful holiday I have just spent at the Riu Palace Agadir. The hotel was beautifully designed, spotlessly clean, the rooms were large and airy. They were cleaned everyday with fresh towels and the cleaning staff made lovely designs on the beds like flowers with the bed throws, I know it may sound silly but it’s the little things that mount up to make a wonderful stay. The food was fabulous and wow so much choice, breakfast, lunch and evening the catering staff really do work hard to make such a delicious spread. The waiting staff were helpful, and polite and were always asking if we were catered for. Sun beds were really comfortable and having a winter break there was plenty spare.

We particularly liked: - the warm sunny weather (during the day) - our spacious rooms - our south-facing balconies which got the sun from dawn to dusk - the variety and quality of the food and drinks - the smiling and efficient staff in both the restaurants and bars - the pre-dinner music in the main bar, to which I made a small contribution! - the plentiful sunbeds around the pools - the total absence of jet lag, visas and jabs. There were very few less good points. But I might mention the problems we had in sorting out which switches did what in the bedroom. After three days I got it right!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 December 2012,4,What a revelation. Can't wait to return.,"I will try to be brief although I want to write a lot about this great hotel and lovely city. This was our first time visiting Morocco and what a revelation. A three hour and 15 minute flight from Manchester is no time at all to get exposure to some much-needed lovely winter sun. The weather was just perfect for us - not too hot, about 20 degree Celsius or 68 degrees Fahrenheit so we felt that we could get out and see the area without being too tired from the heat. The hotel had only opened earlier this year. The staff are very friendly and always try and be helpful. Nabil, our rep, was very helpful and gave lots of useful information about some do's and don'ts and was candid about some of the behaviour of his fellow countrymen in a funny way.

The weather was just right , about 25 degrees and only one cloudy day out of seven , the Hotel has stunning modern decor and the pool area is great and padded sunbeds very comfortable.

 November 2012,5,A tad better than spectacular!,"Stunning is the word, but I will try and keep this short and to the point/s. First impressions are awsome, I do consider that the architect, landscaper, and interior designer should all get some form of international award for their sheer expertise. Being only 8 months old the place is pristine and cleaned round the clock, one only has to glimpse at the reception area toilets and you can see a person loitering with a mop and duster, superlative! Rooms are huge, and well appointed. Food is something else, the quality, presentation, and choice are Michelin Star+ and that is just the buffet.

After reading several reviews online, we decided to stay at Riu Palace in Agadir - there seems to be some confusion over the other Riu hotel nearby - Dunas. To be clear, this is review is for Riu PALACE. The hotel looked stunning on arrival. The walk into reception set the tone for the rest of the holiday. We all felt relaxed and greeted warmly. Although we didn't have a pool view room, we had an excellent sea view room on the 4th floor where we listened to the waves all day and night. We had a twin bed in the main part of the room. Our daughter's bed was a converted sofa in the lounge part of the room, which you stepped down into. We all slept very well, even with the doors open to hear the waves.

Our rooms were exceptionally presented, very spacious, and spotless in all area's, although we didn't have a pool view, we could see the sea, and a very pleasing outlook of the surrounding area from our balcony. The pool area is outstanding with two pools, one heated, the other normal water temperature depending on time of year.

 December 2012,5,Great Value...but...all inclusive guests,"The hotel's very nice. Great public areas, the room was nicer than the more expensive Sofitel that I stayed at earlier in the trip. Food for dinner was good, lunch....not as good I guess. It was great value as it cost me $100 a day. That's great considering it's all inclusive. It was my first time staying at an all inclusive hotel. I have to say it's different. It's hard to fault the hotel for the way guests are, but you'll know the difference when you see it. I think people get a little crazy when they think they have to overindulge to get there money's worth. I would definately stay here next time. It's a great property and well worth the money.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Before we left I was a big uneasy due to the mixed reviews but once there we were pleasantly surprised. The resort is exactly how it is shown in the pictures and is kept very well. The all inclusive was different everyday although they kept some things regular, we also had waiter service at every meal and people were willing to wait on you constantly. The rooms were cleaned at a very high standard every day. All in all the resort was everything we could ask for and the staff were all friendly from management, to waiters, to cleaners.

 November 2012,4,Sumptuous hotel but food could have been better,"I spent a week at the Riu Tikida Palace in Agadir with my partner in early November. Our first impressions of the hotel were that the decor and feel of the place were very grand. The reception area and entrance hall area are beautifully built and finished and make for a very luxurious space. Our welcome was warm and we were greeted with a drink upon our arrival. The bar was also open a little later than usual so that we could get a drink before we retired to our room. The quality of our room was very good - probably one of the best rooms I have stayed in in recent years. The standards of cleanliness are also excellent and the hotel staff very friendly.

Having spent seven nights in the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida Agadir we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel it certainly lives up to its 5 star rating and although we had no need, I am confident that if something is not to your liking then a quiet word at reception will put it right. The location right on the sea front is ideal, the bedrooms are very spacious; there is a very good choice of food and something to suit everyone’s tastes and the spacious lounge and bar were very relaxing with comfortable seating.

Check in was very fast but I did send an email to the hotel reception two days before I travelled which was never responded to as it was honeymoon. We upgraded to a pool/sea view room on the fourth floor which was spectacular at night and was great for watching the sun go down. The food in the buffet restaurant was unbelievable good and after visiting the Krystal restaurant preferred the dining experience in the Buffet more so because I enjoyed getting four small courses followed by desert.

Part of the arrangements were for the company to send us a text 1 hour before the meeting time to confirm everything and when this text didn't arrive we feared the worst.

The hotel was overrun by children and their (mainly French) completely selfish Parents. We chose this particular hotel as it was brand new and one of the Riu 'Palaces' with their reputation at other locations; we were understandably excited and looking forward to our stay. Initially we were not disappointed - the entrance lobby and reception area is one of the most impressive I've seen and although our rooms smelt a bit musty when we arrived, they are very spacious and the beds firm, but comfortable. However from a practical point of view, there are only three small drawers and little shelf space - also nowhere to hang wet towels.

 October 2012,4,Overall very good,"Stayed here for 2 weeks during October with my wife and 18 month old son, and her sister and husband. They had a standard room, and we had a suite with sea view. Our room was 3001, and the only negative I could really say about it was that it looked out onto the pitched roof of the Italian restaurant, which slightly impacted on the nice beach / sea view. Otherwise it had plenty of space, you walked into a “hallway” which had 4 doors leading to: the toilet, bathroom (with double sink, shower, bath, and toilet), bedroom and lounge, and an “open plan” dressing room off to the side.

We went to this new hotel in the first 2 weeks of September and have nothing but positives to report. This is an excellent hotel in the making, it appeared that all senior management had come from other Riu's so the corporate experience was in place. The duty manager was always around talking to guests and helping with requests where possible. The rest of the staff were locals so training was on going and we noticed improvements happening during our stay. The food was good and our only comments was the lunchtime restaurant acousticly sounded more like a canteen due to the large plate glass windows and tiled floor, but we used to go upstairs to the main buffet which had the same food but was quiet.

 July 2012,4,Very Enjoyable,"Hotel was everything we expected. Rooms spacious, comfortable and cleaned daily. Food, we enjoyed and never had any difficulty in finding something to eat. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast and lunchtime when we were able to eat outside. The entertainment teams worked extremely hard during the day and night.

As the hotel had a few issues then we were given an upgrade to a suite overlooking the sea. Wow what a great apartment for us. As before the hotel staff were the best around. The food is to die for. I always 'tip' if I get good service and this year I started tipping from the first day. I must say that hotel staff were very appreciative and very genuine. Our 10 year old had a birthday during our stay..Without prompting he was delivered a card and gift to the room, at Dinner we were sat at a special table covered in rose petals, presented with a cake and really given the Rolls Royce treatment.

 September 2012,3,Plush resort but more suited to the package tourist.,"We stayed here because we wanted to go somewhere that was within a 4-hour flight from London, all-inclusive and with all the usual mod-cons. There is really very little to do in Agadir. Either that, or the hotel staff were very clueless. Package tourists however get a briefing from their tour operator. It didn't really bother us. Being 26 weeks pregnant, I wasn't about to go trekking. But it's worth flagging up. On first impressions, the hotel is grand and swish. Yes the lobby area is somewhat dark, but this makes for a sumptuous evening setting particularly for pre-dinner drinks from the lobby bar.

Before the final few days, we had a lovely time with fabulous weather. RECEPTION The setup is lovely with plenty of space. Sometimes it can take a while to be served at the bar but it rarely takes too long. For Brits used to non-smoking, it seems odd now to find people smoking indoors but it is generally well separated. The bar staff make decent drinks and always seemed to try their best. FOOD I read a few comments from people saying it was repetitive but I'm not quite sure what they are on about.

 October 2012,2,Half Term in Morocco,"Having stayed at several four star Riu hotels in Cyprus and Tunisia and been very happy with the experience I was really looking forward to our holiday in Agadir.This hotel is rated as five star and it could well be with some improvements. The hotel has only been open since May 2012 and already the infrastructure is groaning. The rooms are furnished to a high standard and are spacious although the fixtures and fittings in the rooms are very cheap, flimsy and the workmanship very shoddy. The wardrobe doors kept falling off when they were opened as the sliding mechanism was really flimsy.

 October 2012,5,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful holiday!","This is a fantastic hotel with beautiful grounds and the hotel is very attractive. Plenty of sitting / bar areas both inside and outdoors. Our room was spacious and spotless as was the whole of the hotel. We ate in the main buffet restaurant throughout our holiday and enjoyed the food very much. There was a wide variety of food and we enjoyed trying the moroccan dishes cooked in tagines and enjoyed the themed nights. The staff were very friendly and very attentive. We always ate in the outdoor area except for one evening when it was very windy. All the staff are friendly, helpful and The pool areas were well laid out and we never found it difficult to find sunbeds even when we went later in the morning.

 October 2012,3,nice resort but NOT 5 star.,"I arrived with my family for school half term. We has two rooms, As previous reviews say there was a dreadful smell in one of the rooms (sewage) However, the hotel changed both rooms for us straight away and even upgraded us for free. The weather was awful, it rained nearly every day and they were clearly not geared up for such bad weather conditions (this weather is very rare for morocco). There was NOTHING to do. We ate so much and thank goodness the restaurants were very good standard as you couldnt even go out much as there were road closures due to flooding. The hotel just couldnt cope with everyone staying in the looby and serving drinks etc. No personal touch and difficult to get table service. Shows are mediocre and the kids club is a joke. Be careful of the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Flight from Manchester left on time, there are no in flight meals included in your holiday price, no T.V. to watch or music to listen to whilst on the flight. The cabin crew offer you food and drink at an outrages price £2.40 for a cup of tea (you can get the menu and prices on Thomson fly web site). I thought I had left Rip of Britain back in Manchester, No it’s at 34 thousand feet.

 October 2012,4,A great stay with minor moans,"Having booked independently we arrive via our own taxi, the hotel lobby looked amazing and our first impression from the desk was excellent. This did weaken a little when I felt the knowledge they held was limited to just the hotel. The room was fantastic and I can not fault the cleaning either. We felt the pool was great, we have just returned so maybe the hotel was not at full capacity. Food can not be better the range was great and always flavoursome, I would of liked it hotter. Morocco was one of my best holidays ever. I do think this hotel has some work to make her 5star but is certainly on its way. Oh and I can not forget the staff esp the restaurant team - looked after us amazingly and we did not tip until the final night. Great stay.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 August 2012,3,If you are easily pleased..this is the hotel for you!,"I have pondered this review for 2 months now, trying to calm down after a really disappointing holiday. I want to point out from the off that this review is based on my stay, in the 2 weeks I travelled and based on my expectations. I also want to add that this is supposed to be an international 5* hotel. Hotel - Amazing! Epic in every way. Well finished, great facilities and looks very much the 5* hotel. Beach - Roped off area of a very public beach, dirty and expect to be hassled! Pool area - Where to start?? Area too small for a full capacity hotel. Not enough sunbeds or umbrellas to go around. Too much chlorine in the pool(remember to take your goggles!).

 October 2012,5,Fantastic Stay,"Hotel was fantastic, everything we had hoped for. We stayed in room 2007 for a week in October. Yes our room didn't have the greatest of view's from our balcony, but we were never on it. The room was spotless and not a spot of dust, just like the rest of the resort. The cleanliness was 2nd to non (brilliant). The staff overall was very friendly and we had no difficulties getting drinks at the bar. We only used the main restaurant as the others were closed, but the food was fantastic and the choice suited our every need. The rep at the hotel was nice and gave lots of advice and was ever present. The beach was really good, the only downside was that the private bit for the hotel was well back from the sea, and the surrounding beach area had alot of debries, but was cleared…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is new and has all the Mod cons, the management are very visible and will help out with any problems. They have several restaurants which on the whole are very good. We enjoyed the Italian the most as this was outside and on a nice warm evening it was nice to sit and watch the sun go down. The fusion restaurant was a bit odd. For those that wish to do activities there are plenty to choose from. I played Beach Volleyball most days and we watched the aqua aerobics each day. They have a gym and indoor swimming pool which is nice for a bit of fitness. But note that the indoor and outdoor swimming pools aren't heated.

We had opted for the junior suite with sea views which was lovely - room is large, as was the balcony..it had 2 chairs & 2 sun loungers so we often spent the afternoon on the balcony. No issue with getting sunbeds by the pool and drinks at the pool bar were fine. The main bar/lounge area is large but the area round the bar can get crowded - however we tended to sit by the windows & just asked a passing staff member for drinks which were cheerfully delivered. The staff all seems friendly & happy - we didn't ever tip anyone and this wasn't an issue. Food - plenty of selection in the buffet, food could sometimes have been hotter but it was ok.

 October 2012,4,Lovely hotel - Apart from being ill.,"I stayed here September/October with my boyfriend for 11 nights as part of my trip to Morocco. Lovely hotel but wouldn't say it is 5 star. The hotel has been rushed to open on time and you can tell. The major problem with this hotel is the hygiene/food. I was ill from day two until I left. The majority of people I spoke to had at least one person in their party down with sickness/diarrhoea. GET THIS SORTED RIU!!! We booked direct with Riu and paid for a standard room, I emailed in advance to ask for a sea view if possible. The lovely reception staff made sure this happened. - THANKS RIU. There are only a few standard rooms with a sea view so we were lucky. I would book a sew view room in future as the rest of the standard rooms look on to adjacent hotel walls.

 October 2012,5,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed for a week at this all inclusive hotel, it was our first time to Morocco and our first 'package' holiday. The hotel was opposite the beach with a promenade between the two, walking distance to the marina. The hotel has a private beach area which we didn't use as we are more 'pool' people, the pools are lovely, the only problem I can see with the pools is that you get in via a ladder of three steps rather than a 'walk in', maybe a problem if you have mobility problems. Always plenty of sunbeds and we had no problems getting one each day, beds had lovely comfy cushions. The food is very good with the buffets offering all options, there has to be something for all tastes, we tried the three a la carte restaurants and they were all good.

However I have to say, we found most of the hotel staff to be pleasent and helpful must give a mention to the pool bar staff which made my holiday Yes I did tip them and it is not compulsory but for the sake of £1.50 or £3.77 every couple of days for just that little extra what the hell,the comment that someone has made that this hotel is not for couples is utter rubbish majority of the guest where couples so I don't know where they…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel is a very large complex ,excellent food and premium branded drinks are included in the all inclusive package ,when ordering a drink state Gordon's and tonic rather than gin as otherwise you will be served the local equivalent . Very nice holiday ,reception staff need training to bring this hotel to 5 star standard ,but other than that a very relaxing experience . The only negative comment is the beach in a agadir which needs daily cleaning as its full of rubbish !",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2012,3,Has potential not a 5 star.,We stayed for 11 nights end Sept/October and whilst the hotel is a good standard can advise the following. We were impressed with the room and glad that we upgraded to a pool view. From what we saw the other rooms overlooked other hotels so advise booking the pool/sea view. The room was very very clean and spacious. Well furnished and bathroom was a high quality. Better than the Sandals room we stayed when in Antigua. Rumours of lack of sun beds is a myth plenty of them available throughout the day. For some reason the outdoor swimming pool never seems to be warm so be ready to get a shock when jumping in : ) Drinks are average and not a good quality. Cocktails are poorly made and be aware if any of the staff advise that the branded drinks are out of stock. They arent and speak…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We have always enjoyed our stay at these hotels but we found this one, at best, average and it is nothing special!! It could be vastly improved!! Our room was to the usual RIU Palace standard and was especially good because everything is new. My two criticisms were the wardrobe door kept sticking and had to be slammed to open and shut it. The room next door had a similar problem as they were continually slamming and banging theirs! Also, the bed linen smelt as if it hadn't been aired properly!! What can I say about the food??!! Average, average, average! It had everything any other RIU gives you but there was never anything extra. Where were those yummy fresh prawns we got two or three times…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The food quality was excellent and varied and the bars served good branded drinks. The pool was fantastic and the indoor one huge and rectangular if you wanted to put some laps in.

I understand that this hotel is new and therefore this may explain the teething problems we encountered. Location This hotel is typical of the Riu layout. Beachfront, U shaped resort kept immaculate by the groundstaff. The problem is the beach. It is dirty with all manner of litter scattered on it. My husband and I walked onto the beach and couldn't raise our eyes from the ground afraid of what we might tread on. There is a promanade outside of the hotel with restaurants and a marina about about 30 minutes walk. There are some high street stores here; Zara, Mexx, Aldo, La Senza and Mango surround the boats.

My wife and I experienced the most friendly and hospitable staff, who only wanted to help and assist at any opportunity. What we did notice, were some tourists treating the staff like second rate servants and I would expect that they are the ones who complain about the service. When we arrived, our room smelt of drains and we were moved straight away (they said that this has been a problem they are trying to sort) The hotel is beautiful and the food varied enough. You can book the specialist restaurants, but to be honest they also have Italian and Moroccan food in the main area, so we just ate there.

 September 2012,3,Disappointing,"Having been to a Riu Palace Las Americas hotel in Cancun which was superb, we were expecting a lot more than we we got here - no comparison. Some aspects were good, the main restaurant, the pool, the bedroom despite some quirks, and the bathroom but that's about it I'm afraid - it was way short of the Cancun experience, no more than 3 star imo. The hotel is well positioned but after a storm on the second day of our holiday, the beach was contaminated with all sorts of debris including personal stuff, and this was just scraped up with diggers and left in heaps for the remaining 5 days of our holiday, someone saw rats scavenging round it .

When we arrived we had to change rooms as there was a strong smell of dirty drains in the room. The receptionist did move us straight away. At times you would get a whiff of the same smell round the corridors. Obviously a drainage problem. Putting this aside we both had a really good time, the room was really nice, enough room in the wardrobe and the few draws. Mini bar was re stocked all the time and if you ran out of anything, if you just asked staff they would give you more. The towel saga is a joke and we only did it as others were and so we could get a bed. The hotel really need to sort this out.

You can't fault the cleanliness or the helpfulness of the staff, however I was terribly ill and witnessed lots of other guest experience the same these last two weeks. I think there is a bug going around the hotel but no-one can pinpoint the source. It struck on day 2 and started with tummy gripes, I ended up doubled over in pain and my husband had to go to the pharmacy to buy me 3 sets of pills to get over it. I didn't really eat for 4 days. I think I could count 10 other people I met who had the same symptoms as me.

The room was lovely, very modern and spacious and had everything we needed. Mini bar was stocked the day we arrived and then once more after we asked for it to be filled as we had no water. We did notice a smell of drains in the room in the evenings but it was always when we were getting back to the room to go to bed and we had always forgotten about it by the morning so never mentioned it to reception.

All staff from the General Manager Mr Rafeall down are friendly and work hard to cater to everyone.

 September 2012,4,2nd time back,"Having booked independantly after joining the Riuclass club last time, we were surprised at how little being a memeber actually meant! Saying that, we had a great time all the same. We moved rooms due to the fact that the first one had a clanging sound coming from the aircon which I knew maintenance would not be able to fix, although it was offered. Managed to get into each restaurant this time - nice to have peace and quiet but can't say any of them had better quality of food than the buffet. Very limited choices on the menu's and very small portions, so I'll happily stick to the buffet. I can't say that I got any lesser a service by not tipping and the few times I did, I was told ""not necessary, it's my job"" with a smile!

It was unfortunate that we had to change rooms twice due to a horrible smell of drains. We had only been in the first room for one day when the smell made staying in the room unpleasant. We called reception, their answer was to send someone with air freshener and to switch the air con off. We had to ask to be moved the next day. Sadly, the same thing happened to one of the rooms we were moved to and we had to change rooms again.

The rooms are spacious with good quality fittings and the beds are firm but very comfortable. The TV seemed all singing and dancing but we don't go on holiday to watch TV so didn't check what was available. We didn't have a pool view but were on the side of the hotel with a partial sea view.

So book this up as soon as you get a chance. The reception staff were so friendly and helpful, we were so impressed. The rooms were kept spotless. The pool is lovely and the comfortable sunbeds are great... if you can get up early enough to reserve one. Although the hotel has a sunbed reservation policy, they are still reserved very early.

 September 2012,3,Give it another year to ripe,"The Riu Palace Tikida in Agadir is a very beatiful hotel with a very nice pool area and a good cuisine. But you can really tell by the staff and the service provided that it has not been open for long. They are understaffed, unorganized and basically not up to the task yet of giving hundreds of customers value for their money. Don't get me wrong: the staff is very helpful and extremely friendly, they just need some more time to get everything up to speed and a good shepherd to distribute tasks. Just one very annoying thing about the guests: everybody is reserving pool beds early morning, so if you don't join in on this awful habit, you won't have a pool bed during the day. In general the hotel and staff have great potential and therefore I'm looking forward to the future…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,5,Lovely Hotel and staff!!!,I have stayed with family of 7 in july for a week all inc. Arrived late and we were escorted to the restaurant straight away. When we finished our dinner the room keys were ready and they took our bags to the rooms. Very comfortable beds clean large rooms just what we needed with a child. Next morning we had a fantastic breakfast with all kind of food. Lot of choices and food handling was above what I was expected. I have stayed in lot of places all around the world and I find this place has a high standard. We all had a bit of belly ache but nothing major I thought must have been the water what was served from a jug in the evening. Advised not to drink tap water I only could think they gave is tap water for dinner. My only complain is the indoor pool. I was 6 months pregnant…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 September 2012,5,Wonderful relaxing holiday,"Me and my wife stayed here for 11 nights in September and had a lovely relaxing time. This is the first time we had stayed in a RIU hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality shown to us by all the staff. Everyone seemed to have a smile for us, from the maids to the management. The entertainment team were wonderful and friendly and try to get you involved in different activities, although they appreciate that you probably just want to chill and enjoy the wonderful sunshine. We have stayed in many hotels throughout the world and been on all inclusives for the past 15 years or so and this hotel is right up there. We could'nt find a fault with anything. Okay so the entertainment at night was a bit amateurish but they do their best. There are loads of seating areas to sit in and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2012,4,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed at Rui Palace Tikida in June 2012. The hotel had recently opened and I was very impressed. The room was spacious, modern and tastefully decorated. The hotel itself was gorgeous, lots of little extras than added to the moroccan feel. The staff were great, a tip goes a long way and will certainly get you looked after at the bars. The swimming pool area was nice with comfy sun lounges and delicious cocktails. The location of the hotel is a short walk away from a couple of bars which are definitely worth exploring, very cheap beer, friendly locals and it gives you a break from the complex.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

 September 2012,5,sardine sunbeds BUT.......,"As you will see from the title, we did have a sunbed issue, but to be fair this was only because we cannot stand having to sunbathe in regimented lines of sunbeds where you can't move your sunbed around to follow the sun! To get round this, and to ensure that we got beds and sun umbrella where we wanted, did go down before 8.00 am! There were already quite a lot of beds reserved by this time. The Hotel requests that you do not reserve sunbeds, unless you intend to use them! A pool boy did tell us that if reserved beds were left unoccupied for more than an hour and a half, and somebody else wanted to use them the pool boys could remove the towels etc which had been used to reserve the bed. This seems fairly reasonable, we did see beds that were reserved from first thing in…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Before travelling, our travel agent emailed ahead to tell them it was our honeymoon and upon arrival we were allocated a garden view room. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. I would like to rubbish all the comments about not being ample storage room for clothes etc. Yes there are only 3 drawers but how many pairs of socks do you want to store?? My wife had a few long dresses and the wardrobes were certainly big enough for them to hang nicely.

The food was really nice the first week then seemed to get a little repetitive the second week also not everything was labelled so I was never sure what anything was but you could always ask the chef. We went to all the restaurants some more than once ,service was very quick if not a little too quick the food was very tasty much better than the main restaurant, just remember to book all three when you get there as they fill up quite quick sometimes.

 August 2012,2,disappointing,"This is not a 5* experience. My family (2 adults, 3 teenagers) stayed for a week in August.The hotel looks good, the rooms are comfortable and the staff generally helpful but where it all falls down is the food. It is unimaginative, repetative and the food safety standards are woeful. I work in the food industry and it was a real concern.The food was not always cooked through and the 'hot holding' wasn't effecient. It was very apparent that staff had little idea about food safety and there was much talk in the hotel of people being ill. A few other thoughts: the entertainment provided by the hotel is dreadful but my daughter and I did enjoy a couple of treatments in the Spa.

The wardrobe door was hanging off when we arrived and fell off completely a couple of days in, it was fixed the following morning without us mentioning it, I do wonder if the hotel will continue to look so good as there are already signs of wear and tear.

The mini bar was stocked every day and was also included in the all inclusive. The outside/bar/pool area was always being cleaned, it was spotless. The staff were friendly and the bar staff were very good and would make you any cocktail. Being a five star, the pool towels are included; the poolside beds were half comfy, lay flat cushioned ones, the other half were the stiff ones....obviously the comfy ones went first and crafty people either kept towels from the day before or used their own beach towels so most were 'reserved' by 830.

When you arrive at the airport you must go through passport control to hand over the immigration form which must be completed otherwise you are sent away to complete it so make sure you complete it on the flight. The immigration forms are handed out on the plane. Your passport then gets the arrival stamp. The travel reps and coaches await as usual outside arrivals. There are uniformed porters to assist if you require but they will want tipping. Be aware also of un- uniformed men outside who try to take your luggage for you to the coach. It is easy to assume they are with your rep but they aren't and they then demand money from you if you let them assist. A firm no thank you sends them away looking…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

For those that have rated this poor, must be very fussy indeed! Rooms are large and comfortable, excellent shower and nice big bath. Balcony was also large and had a good view. Pool is great and I like the fact that it is not tiled with the standard blue pool tiles, but a nice green tile which gives is a lagoon time feel, very relaxing.

Our room was on the 3rd floor and had a view of the pool, beach and also the mountain range...amazing. The staff there seem to work round the clock but they're always friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The bar and restaurant staff in particular as they're the busiest places in the hotel.

On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with a welcome drink and the check in was seamless. We were immediately struck by the warmth and friendliness of the staff.

 August 2012,1,Poor.,Stayed at this hotel for 10 nights and feel severley let down. The hygeine of staff needs to be sorted with immediate effect.

One day someone came into the lunch restaurant soaking wet without staff saying anything. Not Good. Yes the hotel is new and it seems to be somewhere people want to go because of this.

The hotel has addressed the problem of sunbeds mentioned earlier, and they are plentiful. However parosols seem to still be at a premium, but it was Eid while we were there which meant the hoteel was full to capacity. As mentioned in an earlier review my friend was also ill during our stay, and as vegetarans we can assure people the meat wasn't the cause. We believe it was the ice cubes and once we stopped having them in drinks her problem cleared up.

Small, silly issue but easy to avoid by the management, pay them more and ban them from accepting tips and doing favours. If you want the same sunbed, get up earlier :-) We stayed at the hotel for the middle two weeks of August so were still there 4 days after the end of Ramadan when 300+ extra people arrived.

 July 2012,5,One Amazing Holiday.. Totally Recommended!,"Well where to start... it was just WOW from the moment we pulled up to the moment we left! The Hotel itself is grand from the outside but it does nothing to prepare you for the inside! A Palace it truly is... and there's all the little extra finishing touches like a welcome cocktail on arrival and nuts served in the lounge bar during the evening (I've now discovered I am a nut fiend!). But I can honestly say what stood out most to me during our stay was the wonderful service from all the staff, they were all so helpful and approachable. The assistant manager is constantly around... in fact I’m sure he must have a double because he was everywhere!

 May 2012,5,Great stay! Got engaged here :),"Loved the hotel, the staff and the location. Beach a bit messy, so stayed in the hotel complex to relax. Visited the souk, took a local taxi, very cheap to do. Get the massage for sure - we had a couples massage and it was so cheap and relaxing. We also took the city tour to the casbah and had a great time - not good if you don't like heights. We were pretty much the youngest people there (apart from kids!) Staff are so friendly and helpful - always there to ensure you have what you need. Great stay for our first time in Morocco",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,5,"Great holiday, highly recommended","Stayed between July 9th-23rd. I booked this holiday for my Mum and I in January. Obviously we were concerned as, like many people, we were taking a risk booking the hotel as it was not yet open. However, really there was no need to worry at all. After reading all the reviews prior to our departure I was certain I wanted to give a thorough review in the hope it helps people when booking a holiday. We had extra leg room seats with Thomson and were very pleased with this. Please ensure if you are concerned about going over on baggage as at the airport I paid £130 for the outbound trip and after this disaster pre-booked the same quantity of luggage for only £30. We paid for the private transfer to the hotel which was a complete waste of money to be honest. The Thomson rep at the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,5,Well worth a visit but still getting things to the 5star level.,Recently spent two weeks at this hotel and I can honestly say that it was value for money. It has a great many excellent features and everybody I spoke to felt there were plenty of positives. As with all things there is some room for improvement and with time I'm sure these will be addressed. The hotel is only 4 months old and because of its infancy things are not always perfect. The staff were superb and every experience I had was positive. The waiting and cleaning staff could not do enough to help. They were genuine and often went out of their way. This was not due to tipping because this did not happen very often. I was there during Ramadan and despite the fact the staff couldn't eat or drink (Even though some days the temp hit 48c) they remained cheery. The assistant manager…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,5,5* service,"My husband and I stayed here for the second part of our Honeymoon in July. We arrived midday after a long transfer from The Riu Palmeria in Marrakech and were instantly aware we had upgraded when stepping into the lobby. We had paid extra for a Studio and were very pleased we did, the room was huge the bathroom had double sinks, walk in shower and a gorgeous bath, there was a dressing area (I was in heaven and draw space was certainly not missed) massive double bed, spinning tv and a lounge area BUT the balcony was what made it special it looked onto both the pool area and the seafront, had two sun beds, table and chairs.

 July 2012,3,A disappointing experience,"It must first be said that the hotel is beautifully finished and the rooms are as good as any I have ever stayed in (maybe even the best); and the standard of cleaning in room was incredible. The quality of the food was good and the a la carte restaurants in particlular were excellent. As mentioned elsewhere, the assistant manager was constantly available around the hotel and extremely attentive when engaged. There is however a real issue for this hotel to face in that it was simply too crowded. There were Q's at mealtimes unless you ate very early, which should be easilly rectified given that there are 2 buffet restaurant's in the hotel but only 1 is ever open at a time. There are a limited number of comfortable sunbeds resulting in the undignified scramble first thing in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

First of all, let it be clear that the hotel is finished, including all bars, the spa, etc... The building itself is stunning, a true palace. The gardens with pools are lovely and very well kept. The rooms are very nice and well equipped. More than enough place to keep you clothes and other stuff. (hangers are way better than drawers...). Very nice bathroom with rain shower and his and her sink. A/C could however be better. During two very hot days the room was a little to warm to sleep. However most days the Moroccan climate (cooler nights) allows you to sleep with the breeze by opening the windows wide. Pools and entertainment. Wonderful…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,5,Amazing,"Recently got back from a weeks long stay with my girlfriend, both aged 20. First things first, the Hotel is amazing. Right from the smallest touches for example, during the welcome meeting the management make an appearance to say hi and they are always wondering around the hotel helping out where they can. If you want good sunbeds, you will need to be up putting the towels down at around 7am, but it's easy enough to pop down, go back for another hour or 2s sleep, go to breakfast and then head to the pool to your towels as it seems this is what most people were doing due to the sun not coming out properly till at least midday. Plenty of choice of food for all meal times with cava available as a breakfast drink. Another small touch that I appreciated was when ordering a coke…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

On arrival the hotel seems to stand in a class of it's own with a beautiful exterior and an even more impressive interior. Arrived about 11.50pm and was handed a refreshing drink, quickly checked in at reception and then offered a cold buffet in the dining room. This was a nice touch as Thompson airlines seem to be going down the road of budget flights and charging outrageous prices for snacks and drinks on their aircraft.

We had a wonderful time and found all the staff very friendly. There were one or two problems but put it down to teething issues. The Wifi did not work from the rooms and had to use the reception area. For some days even had problems getting on to the internet. Other than that we can say we found the food in all the restaurants to a very high standard. The Krystal Fusion restaurant was excellent as was the Moroccan. The entertainment team was very good and provided plenty of day time activities and put on varied shows in the evening which were to a good standard. The rooms were kept very clean as was the whole hotel. They always seemed to be cleaning some area. We…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

On the good side this hotel is fantastic the food is first class plenty of choice , Rooms are one of the nicest we have ever been in , the staff are great will do any thing to help you.Please note the rooms have tea & coffee + a kettle which we were not told of , also free mini bar. the entertainment was not bad but seemed to cater for the moroccans as there were a lot of them,but once they had gone it got better.The under manager was very helpful always walking about speaking to people thanks Raffel…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2012,3,Not a 5 star resort!!!! Food awful.,"My friend and I went for a weeks holiday just to chill out. When booking we were amazed we could get such a nice looking hotel for such a reasonable price... We got there and on first impressions thought the same. However, after about day 2 we realised why, the food was not 5 star standard I would say a 3 at best across all of the restaurants. Whilst there we had NO aircon in our room and when we rang to complain we were told ""it didn't work at night"" and to get on with it. Along with this there were power cuts 3 nights we were there and we're just told to sit tight in our room... In the dark. You had to be up at 8am to get a sunbed at all as they didn't have enough or enough umbrellas we didn't get one at all. They offer no pool service - normally something that wouldn't…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

We like this hotel and cannot find much wrong with it. We arrived on 12th July staying for one week. The sunbeds by the pool - there are plenty available at 9:30am. Ok the wooden sun loungers with mattresses have usually all been taken by then but there are plenty of plastic ones available - the ones I would normally expect to see at the side of a hotel pool. So we have had no problems with getting sun loungers each day. We haven't had to get up early especially to get one. The sun umbrellas seems to be plenty enough.

WOW as you enter the main buffet resturant for the first time. All the above have been reviewed before, and they do make you belive you have entered a 5* Hotel.

Having read the earlier mixed comments, I cab only highly recommend this hotel. As we (two couples from The Netherlands and Italy) had encountered a hick-up in the originally booked hotel (Clubhotel Riu Tidida Dunas), we we're offered by Jakob, the General Manager, a transfer to the newer Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. Having travelled a lot for business and pleasure, I think I know what a good hotel is, and for sure this hotel is the best at present at Agadir. It is brand new, with stunning rooms, great pool area, nice gardens and good food. Of course there we're some details that can improve, but then again, the hotel opened just a few months ago, and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,3,Shame as it could be amazing!!,"Not sure where to start really, so let's start with the good! The aesthetic look of the hotel is very impressive, and spotlessly clean( the cleaning staff need to be noted as superb and very pleasant). The pool area was pretty and very refreshing. The room was large and had everything you need. Now the not so good, the food in general was ok breakfast was excellent but lots of queuing for freshly cooked eggs and pancakes, lunch was a bit repetitive well a lot and chaos kids running everywhere this was also the same at dinner, I know it's the parents responsibly to keep the kids in check but I do feel hotel management need to step in!! The kids were putting food on plates then back in the trays with there hands! Running up and down the isles and playing chase, also we sat next…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,2,Way off 5 star..,"Being a hotel manager myself, I can only view this propery as objectively as anyone views my own hotel. Being honest, this hotel is a long way off its 5 star billing. Myself & partner have been fortunate to visit many similar advertised quaility hotels throughout the world but sadly (at the moment) this is hugely disappointing. The room, on a plus point met our expectations, but we did pay for an upgrade to a suite. It was large, great view of the beach and definatley worth the money, if that's important to you. Other rooms had a view of the pool or of the concrete jungle next door. You pay your money, you take your choice. Having said this, the lift didn't work until the last day so it was a bit of a hike up four floors and with some early morning maintaince work being a little…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 July 2012,3,Very Hit and Miss.,"We have just returned from this hotel (or should I say kindergarten) after what was supposed to be a lovely relaxing 11 night stay. This is a large and stunning looking hotel. The great reviews on here with regard to the rooms and décor in the public areas are spot on and I really can’t add any more. There are some areas not yet finished though, the indoor pool still has wires sticking out where lights should be, a few of the stairwells lack lights too. The gardens are lovely and will be even better once established; gardeners and outside staff work tirelessly at ensuring the immaculate appearance of all the lawns and flower beds and really are the unsung heroes of this place. Our first three days were everything we hoped for and more. However I don’t think this hotel has…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Bit unsure at first when picked up with other couples as taken into the local town and down a back street to be left and a dark and clam reception area of a 'house'. But after the manager chatted with us put us at ease and were taken upstairs couple by couple. All I can say is amazing!!! 2hrs went so quick and felt so relaxed!! Definatly worth £60 a couple!!!

 June 2012,4,Almost 5 Star,"Not quite a five star hotel just yet. But as a new hotel which had only been open 3 months you can understand that it is just a hotel finding its feet. The rooms are very clean and spacious, my mum did want a bit more shelf space, but apart from that we had no problems. Even the shower was good, although there was not much light in it. The only problem that we had, which we feel is a major part of a 5 star hotel is there was no kind of bar/bar service on the beach. We are a family who tend to spend our days on the beach, which was lovely and quiet as not many guests used the beach, and the lack of service in the beach was a letdown in this hotel. One thing i would have liked is the entertainment team to ask those on the beach if they would like to join in with any activites,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Had to make 5 calls over the 2 weeks for bed linen toilet rolls and towels. Rooms quite smelly too!!!

Lobby impressive, pool areas well kept and a lovely spacious bedroom/bathroom. Some positive points mini bar stocked everyday, the food was a good standard for an all inclusive. There are 2 speciality restaurants Krystal (fusion) and a Morrocon, which I both recommend. You can book these by speaking to the head waiter in the buffet. The hotel was spotless. We did receive good service from the drinks waiters around the pool having said that we tip them about £40 during our stay.

The suite upgrade is worth it, the rooms are very spacious and luxurious. All the staff have smiles on their faces and will do anything to make your stay special. Would definatly go back. The final note is the sun beds by the pool, unless you bribe a member of staff of get up at 7am, forget it!

Booking The overall booking by Thomson was good, we had no problems at all, and we spoke to friendly and knowledgeable staff. We booked in January 2012, knowing it wasn’t quite finished. Flight and travel The flight was quick, we didn’t feel cramped and the airline crew were friendly. The only complaint is the cost of food and drink whilst on board, but that's the same with every airline.

It's just sad that people get up at a ridiculous time of morning on holiday just to secure their beds. The hotel should be responsible to ensure people dont save their beds! Pool bar not open you have to complain to get served! The downfall on this hotel is the food and ""service"" you are not greeted to your seat you find it yourself, the staff do not come to you for drinks you have to ask.

The rooms are junior suites: great bathroom, walk-in closset, flat-screen tv and free internet connection. The pool area is fantastic, with chill-out zones where one can relax and waiters going around offering drinks to the guests. You also have two bars in the pool area. One BIG problem is the lack of shadow: there are way to few umbrellas for all the guests and the trees are still not big enough to provide shadow, so that is a big disadvantage. I believe that the hotel management should take serious care of this.

(Pool view is also sea view) THE HOTEL RECEPTION AREA AND GROUNDS A wonderful entrance/reception area which in the evenings is used by guests to have a drink/chat and people watch. Room corridors are long and rather dark and when the electricity goes off (as it often does) you will need a light to find you room as its then pitch black. Pool area is nice with two pools.

On arrival was very impressed with the design of the reception area and the furniture very beautiful. The rooms were very spacious, immaculately clean and the bed was so huge I believe larger than a queen size, crisp cotton bedding for a wonderful nights sleep with plump cushions.

 June 2012,4,All frills - but lacks substance,"Just back from a week at the palace with my wife. Overall comment is that while the hotel is undoubtedly stunning, the personal service from the staff doesn't meet the stature of the rooms and general grandeur of the hotel. This was our first package holiday / all inclusive trip and we feel that some of our comments and issues with our holiday may relate to this - so trying to be as unbiased as possible! ......... The hotel pool is excellent and very big. As others have mentioned though, the demand for sunbeds is ridiculous!

On arrival we were efficiently checked in, although there was no offer on food as others had commented on. We had a pool view room which to be honest was a little disappointing as there wasnt much of the pool to be seen from our room which was in a corner location; that said the room was very nice, well furnished and clean. However I agree there was a definite lack of drawer/shelf space (only three very small drawers and one shelf). Sun bed wars whilst we were there, we had to get up very early (about 7) to get sunbeds and a parasol.

Service was really friendly and happy to help out with various issues. The hotel has a swath of beach, but this not completely separated from the public beach. It did not bother us the least but some may not feel that intimate as they wished in particular during the weekends when the public beach is crowded.

Hotel management - please note. The buffet was very good. Normally my partner and I hate buffets because the food has been sitting for far too long and is usually past its sell by date, but not this one.

 June 2012,5,Returning Guests,"My husband and I stayed in the hotel when it opened at the end of March and although there was a certain amount of work still to be done, we were impressed by the charming, attentive and friendly management and staff of the hotel who did everything possible to overcome any difficulties experienced by guests. At that time it was obvious that the hotel had enormous potential, with a magnificent reception area, spacious well-appointed bedrooms and, when completed, a range of facilities to meet most interests and tastes. As were due to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary, we decided to return to the RIU palace to celebrate this special event. We were not disappointed, all the facilities were open, the gardens had gone through a remarkable transformation and the speciality…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,4,Family first,"We stayed at the Tikida Palace from the 24th May and loved the place. Food excellent,Staff friendly and attentive,relaxed atmosphere(although some of the German guests seem to be trying to turn being on holiday into some sort of competitive sport- best seats etc). We were allocated a room on the 4th floor and were a bit dissapointed having paid for a Family room with a pool view with the size of the room. Having 3 children with us aged 3 and under (yes that was us!) we felt the step in the middle of the room was a hazard, also with the addition of a travel cot + camp beds there was more bed than floorspace! We upgrade to a suite on the same floor- fantastic room, sea view, seperate lounge area much more practical with 2 entrances to the balcony allowing some parent time in the…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2012,5,what a hotel,"This Hotel is stunning, as you probably now it has just opened but its teething problems are not an issue, all the positives outway these negatives. From arriving in the lobby,(wow) the service is second to none with coctails as we check in, the happy and cheerful Raffiel (Assistant Manager) is there to answer any questions . The rooms are clean fresh and very accomodating,no drawer space so what, plenty of other hanging space.We paid extra for a pool view which was apparently the best option. The food is of plenty typical all inclusive, Try the Ala-Cart specialy the Moroccan its amazing. Moez our Thompson rep was in my opinion the best Thompson rep I have had the pleasure in meeting, he seems always to be around where ever you look and always happy to answer any queries.

 May 2012,5,A truly beautiful Palace,The Riu Palace Hotel in Agadir has only recently opened its doors and I must say that I have spent one of my enjoyable holidays there. The decor is stunning with amazing attention to detail. I particularly enjoyed the art work which is in abundance and there are many pieces to amuse and delight even the most discerning viewer. The rooms are large with full bath and shower and a separate toilet which is a useful feature. This is my first stay in once of the Riu Palace chain of hotels and apparently are known for their luxury and this hotel doesn't disappoint. I will defintely look for this hotel chain when booking holidays elsewhere and I am already planning a return visit to stay in the Agadir Hotel. The food is a delight and there is an abundance of flavours and offerings…,Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 June 2012,5,very nice hotel,"Just got back from riu palace after 10 days the hotel is lovely it is very grand you walk in and its wow,the reception and sitting area is massive the fixture' and fittings no expense spared, very grand, we had a pool view paid 70pounds extra well woth it. the rooms are large and split into 2 levels a seating area at the bottom of the room, very nice touch, bathroom very nice but dident like silly wood doors on the toilets, balacony a good size. The main restrant was very good, the food was lovely, something for everyone, and lovely cakes, breakfast was excellent once again lots of choice. The krystal al'carte was a waste of time, there was no wine list as thompsons make such a big thing of in there broucher, and the food was not as good as the main restraunt. the only other…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,Already booked for next year,"Just returned from a week in this stunning hotel. Without reiterating all the other very positive reviews on here we had one our best holidays ever. Never known a week go so quickly. Apart from the usual Gatwick trauma not helped by an overly officious Thomson check-in manager (what is the point of having self-service check-in kiosks but no bag drop facility) the flight was on a brand new 737-800 a pleasant not too long 3 hour flight; Agadir airport was quiet by the time we arrived at 10.30 pm. A quick 30 minute transfer, easy check-in & a cold buffet waiting for us all of which made the journey more bearable. The hotel is only 3 months old so still being finished off; not that it interrupted the holiday. Once the gardens have matured & finishing touches complete it will be…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,4,Fabulously Relaxing Week,"Visited this hotel mid-May for a girlie chill out week. Did not disappoint! Arrived midnight and were pleasantly surprised that a cold platter was available on arrival, which was greatly appreciated. Disliked the wrist bands, but accept that this is pretty much par for the course with most all inclusive hotels. Our standard room with pool view on 3rd floor surpassed expectations. Spacious, very tasteful decor and great additional seating area indoor and on the balcony. Loved the bathroom with double basins and found wardrobe storage and shelving adequate but not generous. Ceiling fan nice alternative to air-con and used this most nights. Outdoor pool tempted us to a pre breakfast swim every day and was a good opportunity to secure our very comfy sun beds. Despite signs…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,Brilliant hotel! Don't pay attention to the negative reviews!,"My fiancé and I stayed at Riu Palace end of May and I have to say it was simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at. 1)the staff are extremely attentive, polite and hard working. Always with a smile on their faces and willingness to help. Most of them speak 4 languages which is very impressive. We tipped between 10-20dirham and they will all go the extra mile for you. I think no matter everything else the staff are the main thing for me that makes this hotel brilliant. 2) food was superb! You can eat a lot and you can also eat very healthily, you sometimes forget that you're eating a buffet food. There are plenty of lovely little starters and also tiny cakes so you can try 3 or 4 different types without filling up too much. Great selection at breakfast and in the evening they…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,3,not 5*,"Went to this hotel at the end of may,the weather was hot and the air con in rooms was not on had to ask at reception. Have stayed at the rui tikida in Marrakesh which is only a 4* and offers so much more along with better service and more staff present around the hotel,the hotel was only 70% full and there was no where enough staff,only one outside bar was open. The same food is offered every day in the lunch time restaurant which becomes a bit boring. Couldn't get in the Krystal restaurant even though we tried the day we arrived,but did manage to eat in the Moroccan restaurant which was excellent best meal of the holiday. I feel the hotel has opened to soon and they have rushed the finish they should have opened later when everything was ready. also couldn't sit on the balcony…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,4,Stunning hotel for the price!,"Recently returned from a week's stay at the palace, all inclusive with Thomson. We had night flights which took 3.30hrs and transferred from Agadir airport direct to hotel in 30mins with lots of great local info from the rep, was very quick & hassle free... No time difference from the UK either which suprised us as we thought there was 1hr! The front of the hotel is not that impressive, but as you step into the lobby area - 'Wow'. The decor from floor to celing is stunning and represents a true 5* hotel. The reception staff on check in were very helpful and we received a welcome drink on arrival too, which was a nice touch. As we arrived late to the hotel, the all inclusive was still available for us with a selection of cold dishes. Arrived at our standard room on the 4th floor…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Obvious he just sells thomson tours. Do the hotel a favor, get rid of the thopmson salesman and get a proper rep.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,Best hotel ever!,"We stayed at this hotel for a week in may and absolutely loved it, the staff at this hotel make you feel special as soon as you walk through the front doors into the stunning lobby! The food was the best we have had at a hotel and make sure you try and get into the moroccan restaurant as it is superb. The pool area was lovely and so great that you can just walk outside onto the beach. The waiter service round the pool was great and there were activities going on all day if you fancied it. Not many kids there which was nice for us and the sun loungers and beds around the pool were lush! Don't miss out on visiting this hotel before the prices go up next year!!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,"Amazing holiday, beautiful hotel","We stayed here 21st-31st may! We loved every min! The only thing that wasnt open was the spa, hairdresses, but why would u use hairdresses on holiday! The pool bar is open but because nobody sat there it looked closed, but all you had to do was let one of the bar staff know you was there! The pool area was beautiful! Our room was amazing, no draw space but wasnt that bothered! Tea, coffee making facilities, fridge was stocked up every day! U need a pool view because other views wernt great! One disappointment was the beach! Didnt have the wow factor like the hotel! Its a small area cordened off well away from the sea!

 May 2012,4,Wonderful value,"Just returned from 10 nights here and we loved it on the whole. The hotel is beautifully furnished and the rooms are very spacious and modern. Probably the best part is the staff. They are all without exception top class and definitely five star worthy. The deputy manager was outstanding, very professional and took an interest in guest stays frequently. The all inclusive is the best we have experienced yet with amazing variety of very good food and branded drinks!! The pool is amazing and not over crowded (initially) which we really liked. Plenty of quality sunbeds available and drinks served round the pool...heaven! The evening entertainment was good. Very relaxing bar area with a singer/pianist/sax player who were super and then a show most nights for something a bit livelier.…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,Excellent place for holiday,"I have spent 3 nights in May 2012 in hotel Riu Palace Tikida Agadir during my trip in Morocco. I have to say, that the hotel is excellent. Very charmy atmosphere, luxury equipment. The room was enough spacious. The food excellent. Nice staff in the restaurant. Outdoor facilities great. Two large swimmingpools, one of them heated. Perfectly treated beach. Hopefully they will finish soon the spa centrum - it was only one negative thing in the hotel, that the spa centrum was not ready Yet.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,Abfab hotel,"Fantastic hotel. Variety of fresh food at all times. Drinks of good quality. Ample sunbeds in very nice grounds. Waiter served drinks trolley comes round during the day which is nice if you cant be bothered to get off the very comfy loungers ! Was not happy with our ground floor room on arrival but this was quickly sorted by the very obliging Moez (thompson rep) the promenade at the front of the hotel is clean & safe to walk out at night. I dont know if its normal or if we've dropped a little unlucky with the weather but so far its been overcast until dinner time but once the sun breaks through, its VERY hot. It can also be a little chilly at night so best to bring a cardigan just incase. Have eaten at crystal restaurant which was nice but if you're a big eater you may need to…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,Fantastic holiday,"just returned from an 11 night stay at the Riu palace Agadir, and i have to say i cannot fault this hotel, or its staff. the rooms are very nice, and i found the bed very comfortable. bathroom facilities are excellent. all the staff are friendly and really do go out of their way to help. special mention to the assistant manager(raphael) was on hand all the time helping with any query. the a la carte restaurants were both excellent in my opinion too! Pool area was great, lovely sunbeds, and one pool was heated which was a pleasant change from other places i have been. yes the spa/hairdressers wasnt open yet, but i wouldnt have used either anyway. in my opinion it was without doubt the nicest hotel in Agadir, and i would return in a heartbeat!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,Loved it here!,"We spent 7 nights here, the second part of a twin centre holiday. We were pretty nervous about what we might find as the hotel had not been open long but we loved it here. They are making great progress and the only things that were not ready were the hairdressers (who goes on holiday for a haircut?!), the spa (but very reasonable trips for massage available) and the games room (I have no idea what they will do in there!). We had a 4th floor room with a sea view and a view of the mountains and it was beautiful. Decorated to a high standard, a lovely bathroom and hard beds that personally suited me down to the ground. I would have been disappointed with a pool view as the mountain view is pretty special. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day, the towels are soft…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,5,Paradise,"Having trawled the hotels in Agadir (we had to leave a disaterous hotel after only 1 night!) and physically looked at at least 4 hotels (including Sofitel) I can honestly say that I would be shocked if anyone could find anything better. From the moment we made our begging inquiries as to their availabilty to the time we checked out, I can honestly say that I have no complaints as everything was perfect. We have been doing this annual birthday holiday for years and this is the first time a hotel has ""ticked all the boxes"" and met with our very high expectations - so much so ,we're already looking to book again before the end of the year. Our only disappointment was that we couldn't get into their restaurants - that wasn't the fault of the hotel as we had only 3 days left of our…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

The hotel wasn't filled to capacity only about 300 guests out of a possible 900 but the staff although a bit a bit sparse worked very hard. The food was excellent and the night we went to the Krystal was amaxing, first class although we were unable to get booked in the 2nd week and also the Moroccan restuarant was fullly booked. Rafael the deputy manager was always around checking that everything was in order. We has a pool view which was outstanding.

Agree the the beds are rock hard. The pool area was lovely, everywhere was clean, staff very friendly, our 15 month old daughter was treated like a star! Food-good choice and quality, although not quite as good as the Riu Palaces we've stayed at in Aruba and Mexico. Flight times are the only factor that would prevent us revisiting-please change Thomson! You will not be disappointed by this Hotel.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,4,Honest Truth,"A brand new hotel with a few teething problems!!!!!!!!!! Had a good flight from Gatwick, and an easy check into the hotel which all ran smoothly. Rooms are all much the same unless you ask for a double bed, or two singles. I wish we had asked for two singles as the double was far too hard and I had to ask them to make up the sofa bed for me to sleep on. They did this with no problem. Yes there are no drawers, but plenty of shelving so can’t see the problem with previous people moaning about this. We noticed that after returning to our room on a daily basis the maids had replaced all of the plugs, we realised why after returning and using the sinks etc if you didn’t you would get a nasty smell from them. Something I think they may be working on. We found the rooms to be…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 May 2012,4,Work in progress but has potential for excellence,"Just returned from a week at the Palace. Weather was fantastic and pool area amazing. Quality of furnishings in the bedrooms and the public areas are first class. Krystal and Moroccan restaurants open but not the Italian or the Spa. Had disastrous night in Krystal due to staff being under resourced - waited almost an hour and a half for main meal so left. Complained to Manager, Raphael who eventually resolved the situation. Bedrooms - no draws and no sockets infront of mirrors for us ladies so drying/straightening hair almost impossible - I asked for extension which was supplied.

Even the hotel management are really hands on and couldn't have been more helpful. Although the in-house spa wasn't open the alternative one in Agadir was excellent.

Lovely safe sandy beaches with a private area for Riu guests Went for walks on the prom and also into town. The bedrooms were large and well furnished. Sea/pool view room is worth the extra money. The room even had a kettle. Bizarre that no drawers in the room. Good service from Thomsons. Brand new aircraft. Wide age range of guests. Wifi works. Always a cooling breeze fron the sea.

The food in the main restaurant couldn't be faulted, we tried to eat in the Moroccon restaurant but unfortunately it was full but we did eat in the Gourmet restaurant and whilst the ambience was perfect we preferred the food in the main restaurant.

 May 2012,5,Beautiful addition to Riu collection,"I have no real criticisms of this hotel. It is a lovely place to stay. The rooms are lovely and of a good size. I enjoyed having my own sink in the bathroom. Only comment I would make is that I could have done with some drawer space. There do not appear to be any drawers at all. It has only just opened and it is early in the year so not all the bars and restaurants were open but that did not detract from our enjoyment at all and yes - it is just being finished off but so what, it is still a first class hotel.

But the rest of the hotel was more or less up and running. We had wonderful food the whole time we were there and we went to one of the restaurants that you have to book. The food was lovely. We both love Morocco and the people so we were truly in heaven at this hotel. There are two Casino that are just across the road and many shops just outside the Hotel.

Firstly I will say that we are great fans of both Morocco in general and Agadir and have stayed in various hotels around the resort over the past few years.We are also keen on RIU Hotels and have been very satisfied with the standards at the ones in Marrakech.Having paid quite a lot more money for the Palace we were interested to see what we would get in addition to the services offered at the Tikida Palmeraie which is 4*.

The trees were still under wraps and tied up. Lots of workmen around and not enough guests for an 'atmosphere'.

 April 2012,4,A Great Holiday,"Like the other reviews have said this will be a fantastic hotel and guest experience once finished. The furnishings are to die for and the reception in particular is one of the most impressive I've seen. The Manager is working hard to get this hotel to the 5* level and will often be around day and night to gain feedback from the guests and guide the staff. Bedroom - Bathroom fantastic just needs light over the bath, bed is superbly comfortable and room is furnished to a high standard. More drawer space required and TV is a little too low. On the whole the housekeeping was inconsistent, dusty surfaces, cups and glasses washed out when it suited, bed not made to any particular standard, the rooms will only be as good as the person checking them!!!

 April 2012,5,Really Lovely Hotel,"We have just returned from a week at this hotel, this was our first visit to Morocco and we had a lovely time. The hotel is beautiful and yes there are some finishing touches still being carried out but this did not interfere with our stay in any way. On arrival the check-in process was very smooth, plenty of staff on reception desk so were in our room in no time. We had paid a little extra for a pool view room and I think it was well worth it. We were on the fourth floor and could also see the sea and the Kasbah which was lovely in the evening when it was all lit up.

From the moment you walk through the front doors, you are presented with a vast reception area that takes your breath away. There are loads of comfy sofas, chairs and sculptures set in a room around the size of three football pitches. With impressive architecture, lighting and water features it really was jaw dropping. After a somewhat chaotic checkin experience, we were directed to our room (2099). We had a view onto a wall and neighbouring street but this didn’t really bother us as we never pay extra for the view as we would rather have a quality room. I can confirm that the Tikida Palace doesn’t dissapoint. We had a large balcony with two comfy chairs and a table. This led into a living area with a dining table, two…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir

Did request mini bar and coffee/milk to be to be put in room every day, unfortunately this is only done every other day. The manager was looking into this.

Pool area The pool area is amazing, with lots of wooden sunloungers which you can easily move to where you want. There are also numerous cubby holes and balinese beds/cabanas which are more shaded and private. We never had trouble getting space by the pool and sometimes we didn't get there till early afternoon.

We should not blame the hotel for not delivering, but ask about the UK tour operater to be a little more frank and honest in future, perhaps. We holidayed 12th - 19th April. We were very apprehensive at the airport but was immediately re-assured by the SUPERB Thomsons Rep ""Moez"". His professionalism matches that of the hotel that he works in.

Then we were put in an amazing room with a large lounge area. The only downside was that the balcony did not look onto the pool (we should have paid extra for this). The rooms, like all of the hotel, were super clean and the maid did a great job. All the food was delicious and we never ran out of things to have.

Work is still ongoing and I could see that the early bookers perhaps got a different experience from us but believe me you hardly notice the work going on and if you do notice it you will admire the attention to detail going on! There are still people moaning at the hotel but everyone I spoke to was more than happy with the whole holiday experience and found any disruption to be kept to a minimum during the busy day time periods. Pros; food is fantastic in the main restaurant and varied and they will cook fresh for you, speciality restaurants were very enjoyable. Beautiful hotel, amazing architecture and design, lovely staff with good sense of humour and management with caring attitude. Great location and…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2012,5,A fabulous experience!,"Just got back this morning at 4.00am and wanted to write straight away about the magical experience we had at the Rui Palace. Yes, the hotel isn't finished yet but the staff more than make up for any inconvenience and the fact the hotel was half empty added to the relaxation and the personal touch's from the hotel management. The food was to die for, so much choice and freshness. We tried all the restaurants, all were excellent. We had two 13 year old with us and they loved the pool and the choice of food at the buffet table. Really sorry if the hotel have now ran out of chocolate orange ice-cream! The Thompson rep was outstanding, really doing his job and worked hard to solve any problems. We hope in years to come we will be able to afford to go back and see the hotel…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2012,5,Fantastic new hotel,"My wife and I are just back from a week at this hotel. Although many things are not yet completed (shop, hairdresser, gym) the hotel is very much up-and-running. The room was spacious and quite superb. The food in the main buffet restaurant first class, with great variety and excellent service. The staff are very willing and well trained. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and it will be fun to return one day and see how the gardens are maturing. The hotel also has a wonderful location halfway along the very nice Agadir prom. The things which were not yet ready did not detract from our holiday at all, we knew the hotel had just opened before we went.",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2012,5,Great holiday!,"We just got back yesterday from a relaxing week at the Riu Palace Tikida Agadir. Ok, the hotel isn't completely finished yet, but I think other people told enough about that part in previous reviews ;-) We had a great week and would recommand this hotel to anyone who'd like to go to Agadir. We took a walk along the Promenade and believe me, this is by far the nicest hotel in the area! People walking by, stood still to take a look, really an impressive building. By arrival, we got a drink and check in was friendly and quick. The reception and lobby area have a very luxurious look (and this wasn't our first 5* experience ;-)) and nice seats. We really liked the room : spacious, large balcony, huge bed (I must say a bit too hard for me, maybe because they're brand new?), great…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2012,4,"Definitely still a work in progress, but much better than expected!","I feel a bit like Wico32 as I start writing this, but since we weren't there the very first week it opened, I think we probably got a slightly better deal. Nevertheless, my issue is with the amount of money we paid for a week during school holidays, when they always hike the prices up, and for that reason I feel we had poor value for money. There is definitely the WOW factor as you walk into the lobby/reception area, and the room was lovely, as described by Wico, but I agree a lack of drawers could be an issue for some, perhaps especially a bedside drawer. Everywhere in the main building is spotless - with constant cleaning going on! We arrived in the evening after dark, so waited until morning to view the outside. The pool area was getting there - one pool bar is now open…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2012,5,Will not regret,"I was literally in tears days before we were due to fly out and soon as we arrived, the greeting at the hotel changed everything! This hotel is a palace n will definitely go on to becoming the best hotel in agadir! Yes the gardens are not finished and small cosmetic work is going on but really the service was fantastic, food amazing and great variety, sun beds you could fall asleep on and luxurious rooms! All in all the good out weighed the bad. For the price we paid for the hotel I truly believe we got an amazing deal and were lucky to be some of the first people to stay here!",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2012,3,Feel cheated out of the 5 star experience we were expecting,"This is a difficult review to write, I could tell everyone what a fantastic hotel this is, well in a way it is but I think you should write a review on your holiday experiences and not what it could have been and as the hotel was not fully completed this is reflected in our review. On arrival you are amazed by the grand entrance and the general feel of quality in the reception. Our cases were taken to our room, and I did think the rooms were a little smaller than expected. The finish is all very good with good lighting etc. The room is split on two levels, which is fine for us but if you have to get up in the night and it’s pitch dark be very careful you don’t fall over. The bathroom is lovely but in some ways it’s been over designed, the doors are louvred which look great but…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 April 2012,5,Paradise in Agadir.,"We were some of the first visitors to stay in Riu's new hotel in Agadir and WOW what a treat. The lobby is like a Christmas Tree of beautiful art. The rooms are a hitch up on other Riu's that we have stayed. Flat screen TV, big bath and a 2 showers. A nice outside balcony. The spa wasnt finished (we were informed of this in advance) but the indoor pool was superb for our 2 boys 6 and 9. The foodhalls are in the same mould as all the Riu's and for us the local cuisine was a winner. The main bar in the lobby was glamorous and had a 'West End' feel to it. The staff were attentive and always smiling..The 'Animation Team' fantastic. I think that word will get around and this hotel will fill up quickly. We're going to book up immediately for a return this autumn. 10/10",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
 March 2012,3,Not Ready Yet,"The hotel basically has great potential. It will be by far the most grand and swanky hotel in Agadir....BUT it's just not ready to receive guests yet. I guess RUI just didn't want to bite the bullet having already taken bookings. Disappointing from them. We checked in last week and despite assurances that only minor finishing touches were going on, that is not the case. Angle grinders, builders' dust, general banging, landscaping, etc. The staff are trying to keep it clean and contained, but can only do so much. Also because not all rooms were available yet, occupancy is relatively low, which means the restaurants are operating on a restricted basis. Spa is not open yet. Fitness area, although open, is a work-in-progress: only a few machines in it and no facilities like towels,…",Riu_Palace_Tikida,Agadir
