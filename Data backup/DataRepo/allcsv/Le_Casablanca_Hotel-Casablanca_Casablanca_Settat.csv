We had one night in Casablanca before we returned to the UK and were looking for something in a good location that was luxurious and could accommodate three people in a suite. We expected that to be hard to find, but my searches on TripAdvisor and Hotels.com led me right to Le Casablanca Hotel. We had a bit of confusion when booking because the listing on Hotels.com said that the rooms could accommodate up to 3 people but their website said 2. I emailed them stating my desire to have 3 adults in the room and they gave the go ahead. Then when we arrived they said they had no record of us being a party of 3 and that we would have to pay an extra fee (not a big one, thankfully).

We also ate at the other restaurant (forgetting the name) and it was also very good. A couple of things about this hotel that stood out and would have taken it to another level: The pool is very nice, but it's almost impossible to get a waiter. You end up having to go upstairs to the restaurant bar to order and then wait, and wait, and wait for your drinks. This seems odd, since drinks are a money maker so they're leaving money on the table (and frustrating guests) by not servicing this area.

What happenend ? i had been here twice before, ate at the terrace with my kids ( 10 and 17 and 19 ) with the pictures in my phone to prove it. However this time it was soooo embarrasing as i had 2 kids outside the revolving door , the youngest one in the lobby, and everyone panicking about a lovely pretty well dressed little girl in the lobby ???

Also in the bathroom there was no way to keep water from dripping out when having a shower due to a badly installed glass and faulty rubbery part beneath that (room 309), which by the way was clogged and the water would not go down the drain properly.

 July 2019,5,My Beautiful Engagement at Le Casablanca,"We stayed in the Le Suite Art Deco: the bathroom, separated by frosted glass doors, was the biggest I've ever seen and the bed was accented with mini crystal chandeliers covering the lights. The best part of this hotel and the whole reason I wanted to book it was the Terrasse Jasmin. A mix of black & white striped curtains against a two story ceiling and views of the impeccably landscaped dining patio, pool and garden area. My fave feature were the 4 ft tall black iron standing chandeliers all over the property!

Bouthaina, supported by her team were only too ready to meet every request and very kindly upgraded my stay to a charming room with a view. Her role was central to my having booked to stat once again, she is both professional and incredibly polite. The hotel is by all means a boutique hotel, so there are moments when one is left calling for services without response. The bell boys are incredibly helpful and accommodating.

I stayed at Le Casablanca Hotel in August 2019, during my fourth tour of Morocco. Prior to my stay, I stayed at La Mamounia in Marrakech and Kasbah Tamadot in the Atlas Mountains. This was my fourth visit to Casablanca and each time I have tried to work out which hotel might be the best. There is a wide choice and no clear winner, I sense. - The hotel is prettily designed, with a lovely garden, small but beautiful pool and an attractive exterior. - The beds are large and very comfortable with a firm mattress and soft bedding. - The rooms are a good size, well equipped, with plenty of plug sockets. - The wifi and air conditioning work well. - The hotel is around 15 minutes‚Ä¶",Le_Casablanca_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Le_Casablanca_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 May 2019,4,Very good hotel in a nice quite neighborhood,"Clean and decent hotel, highly recommended. My only gripe is that the front desk would refuse to arrange for a taxi to the airport and will only give you one option, to use the hotel car. The car charges double of what a grand taxi does.

First of all, two emails asking about the shuttle from the airport, resulted in no response. We took a taxi for $30. After checking in, I asked about them calling us a taxi for the return to the airport. The manager flat out refused, telling me that it wasn‚Äôt safe. We took the hotel shuttle, which was $65. I don‚Äôt believe safety was his concern, just greed. Upon checking out we were faced with another $60 charge for breakfast for two.

 April 2019,5,Thoroughly loved it,"There's so much to love about Le Casablanca Hotel. Service is really outstanding all around. Rooms are large with very comfortable beds. It helps to be situated on the side of the building not facing the street -- or bring your ear plugs to dampen the noise. The bathrooms are lovely, with a high pressure shower (be wary of flooding the floor inadvertently however) and absolutely the finest and best, super-huge bath towels that I've ever experienced in a hotel. I especially enjoyed the bar area, extremely well staffed and nice selection of liquors to enjoy at a not-too-expensive price.

The d√©cor was lovely although the rooms are just a tad on the tired side. The breakfast buffet had lots of choices. The cocktails in the bar were on the expensive side, about $12 each and while some of the drinks have typical names like Manhattan, don't expect the typical drink. I ordered a Manhattan and it was made with something that tasted like what I have had another time called Fireball Cinnamon whiskey. My friend ordered a cognac and what she got was something over ice in a brandy snifter. However, these were minor issues and we found the staff to be very nice and the hotel quiet.

Great bedding, extremely comfortable, nice clean toilets & shower space. Welcome fruit bowl was provided in the room which was a nice gesture.

Unfortunately when I came to my room (standard) I felt a bit disappointed as the decor did not match at all what I saw in the lobby.. The red color in the room feels aggressive and not calming after a day out in the city. Even if the hotel meant to repeat some art deco style this has not been the best result in my opinion.

Breakfast service was like a car crash every morning - I needed to be there for when it opens (7am ...... not early enough) and every day nothing was really ready. Over 3 mornings no one asked me if i wanted any drinks, i had to go to the counter to ask. No one on duty to greet the guests, no one there to say goodbye, most light in corridors turned off so it is diffuctl to find anyway. And others things - only one lift woking over the whole week, and the other one was a bit intermittent, Bar service inthe evening is hit and miss - lots of staff standing aorund but no one serving. So‚Ä¶",Le_Casablanca_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Le_Casablanca_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2017,3,Valet parking,"I booked this hotel for one Night. The location of this cozy hotel is perfect and the service is was good. But the staff of the valet parking was weird. On arrival I left the keys of my car at the valet. One of the employee who parked my came to me in the lobby and said: ""I parked your car safely"". I was confused lol, but I thanked him friendly. By checking out the same employee came to me and said: "" I brought your car""! He repeated it twice?! An other colleague said something to me but I haven't heard what he said. This guy answered him and told him to shut up because he was talking to me. I started to laugh. But what he indirectly was asking is money for his service. I only gave a tip to the guy who put the luggage in my car.",Le_Casablanca_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Le_Casablanca_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2017,5,Great hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel with a great relaxing atmosphere. The food and breakfast was amazing. The were 2 negatives the first service was some times slow and staff not attentive enough to our needs. The second was the language barrier and this could also apply to my 1st negative. We don't speak French or Arabic and the staffs English was weak, this was made up by Mohamed at the reception desk who was there to translate our needs at all times. We were also approached by the manager Amin who acknowledged on the changes required and they were being implemented in the near future. Due to your insurety for future plans and thank you to Mohamed. You made it a 5 star stay.",Le_Casablanca_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Le_Casablanca_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 July 2017,5,Casablanca's highlight,"My wife and I stopped in Casablanca in our way to West Africa and decided to stay in a nice place for two nights. We couldn't have choose better. After a warm reception by Said despite our late arrival, we went straight to the room, that was just wonderful, wide and comfortable, with a huge bed a bit too soft for my taste. The staff is wonderful there, very kind and helpful, and the swimming pool is the place to relax yourself. Breakfast is outstanding and we even had dinner one night, nice snack food (especially the tomato salad and the burger) in a very romantic atmosphere. I really enjoy staying there and can't thank enough Said for make things as smooth as possible to us.",Le_Casablanca_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Le_Casablanca_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2017,3,a wonderfull place ruined by unskilled staff,"I was not sure about my section for this hotel as im a frequent flyer to Morocco and a I usually stay for not less than 10 days for business I tried most of Casablanca hotels ,so if you are planning for long stay you should consider the following points 1- the hotel decorations and lobby is extremely elegant . 2- Room with good size and well furnished ,(however not al tv channels works + working desk is relatively small) . 3- Hotel location is very good and near to the new downtown 4- swimming pool is very nice (but I don't understand why you are working on the floor maintenance over the week end when most of the guests were looking for relaxation) on the other hand the pool was closed for maintenance (this is normal) 5 - breakfast is very nice ,and in dinning is very classy‚Ä¶",Le_Casablanca_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Le_Casablanca_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2017,4,Flamboyant luxury that Footballers' Wives would adore,"To Casablanca for a few days work. Le Casablanca hotel is the relatively- new, chic spot in town for affluent locals and small business conferences. Located on a central road with a few western premium brand boutiques, and some local restaurants of varying degrees of smartness within walking distance. Whilst you couldn't describe the luxury as, er, exactly understated, it's comfortable, airy and spacious. Plenty of public areas for lounging and meeting, a good pool and a ( pretty small) gym room. Eating and drinking options indoors and out and a well-stocked, √ºberglitzy lobby bar. Bed was very comfortable with a good - sized bathroom with wide bath, Clarins toiletries. Don't rely on ease of the free wifi connection, or much reliable continuity.... Nespresso coffee‚Ä¶",Le_Casablanca_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Le_Casablanca_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
