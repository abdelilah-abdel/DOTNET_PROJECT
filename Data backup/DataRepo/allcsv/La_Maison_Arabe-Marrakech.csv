 December 2022,5,The best of both worlds!,"My family of 5 loved La Maison Arabe! It was a perfect home base for us in Marrekesh for 4 days. We had a deluxe room and a standard suite for our 3 kids (older teenagers). Both rooms were lovely. The suite was especially nice because the 3rd bed was in its own little niche so it wasn't so crowded in the main space. Rooms were good-sized and clean. Beds were very comfortable with soft sheets. Bathroom was nice - clean, spacious and good products with fluffy towels. I have read a few comments about the hot water - we had no problem at all. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure (weak water pressure is a pet peeve of mine). The hotel itself is very unique & charming, with lots of different areas to explore. The bar was old-school with dim lights and dark furniture. We…",hotelName,city
 April 2022,5,another wonderful stay,"Our second stay, and this was just a great as the first. We love it and cannot fault it. A great new addition are the rooms in the Douiria with a gym and new rooftop terrace. The swimming pool provides a welcome cool down in the afternoon and the evening is finished by a cocktail in the Jazz Bar. Very well located for the Souks and main square Jemaa el-Fnaa, which are short stroll away. This is the only place to stay in Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2023,5,Excellent hotel and top quality service,"We had an amazing stay at this hotel. The riad style (Morrocan-style house and courtyard) makes for a truly authentic experience.

 January 2023,5,Strongly recommended,"Just back from a week at this fabulous hotel. Stayed in a standard room which was of an excellent standard in terms of comfort, cleanliness and location. We paid for a deal including breakfast which was great as choice of food was fantastic, including a brilliant egg chef and local pancake lady. Definitely worth every penny. Had a couple of meals in the restaurant which was delicious. Throughout our stay the level of service and friendliness was outstanding - better than pretty much any other hotel I’ve stayed in. Location fantastic - turn right out of door and the main square and soukhs are a short walk away, turn left and the new town area is equal distance. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel - and if you’re going to Marrakesh I honestly don’t think you could do…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

It was such a pleasure to learn about the history, spices and techniques used in traditional Moroccan cooking, and then implementing those techniques to make a delicious meal which we ate at the end of our class. Enjoying the fruits of one’s labors and sharing it with others can be very gratifying. We would like to thank Wafa, our workshop coordinator, and also Soukaima and Kauter who showed us the techniques. They were wonderful to work with. A shout out to Abercrombie and Kent for making this experience possible. They created a lifetime of great memories for us.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 December 2022,5,Outstanding Service,"We would like to warmheartedly thank all team members at La Maison Arabe, in particular, the front desk personnel (Mousad, Rajaa, Hakim, Ismail, Youssef and Idiss) for an awesome stay. My partner and I (we are a same sex couple) were treated by each of them like family. We stayed in Marrakech a total of 6 nights (5 nights at La Maison Arabe and 1 night at the Royal Mansour). We found the service at La Maison Arabe to be more intuitive and warm than at the Royal Mansour. We are looking forward to our next stay. Good job!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,Cooking Class,"My family and I are staying in Marrakesh. Today we did a cooking class, which was amazing. The people were lovely and truly so passionate about their work and love of others. We learned all about the history of the dishes we were making. Our chefs were Wafa and Habibi, they were amazing. Being around them all you can do is smile. And on top of all of that the food was DELICIOUS. Truly, I have been to my gate share of good restaurants and this was amazing. And I made it myself. They send you home with the recipes that you cooked. And a gift… which you will see when you go. All in all you should definitely consider going to this cooking class, the grounds and kitchen are beyond beautiful.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,You DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS!!,"My family and I did a private Moroccan Food Cooking Class. It was an INCREDIBLE experience. Absolutely FANTASTIC! Wafa and Habibi were our instructors and couldn’t have been kinder/nicer and more hospitable! We were taught all about the history of Moroccan food and it’s influences in a BEAUTIFUL setting w gardens and a traditional Moroccan kitchen where we all had our own stations to work at. We had delicious tea and then went on to cook and eat a traditional vegetable soup, two salads, tagine and desert. The food was incredible and the experience was outstanding! I would HIGHLY recommend this as it was a highlight of our trip.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 November 2022,5,A real find,"After a very disappointing night in a Riad my wife and I wanted to find somewhere else to spend our last night in Morocco. After a bit of research we found La Maison Arabe and went to have lunch there and check it out. We booked a room there and then and had a perfect 24 hours.

If I ever go back to Marrakech I will deferentially stay again in this hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,Splendid stay!,"Luxurious stay and made me feel like a royalty! I had a two night stay and it was a bliss. Obviously the prices here including the food, dinner, spa and etc. adheres to the luxury label of the hotel but it's all worth it. The spa is wonderful and had the best hammam/massage. The dinner is amazing while the breakfast buffet is one of the best I've had. The service is what really counts and they really made sure I'm perfectly well and pampered and all attained to my needs.

 December 2022,5,Best hotel in Morocco,"My wife and I have stayed in 5 star hotels around the world and this one ties with the Four Seasons Bora Bora as our favourite place. It is charming , elegant ,and luxurious. The staff really bring this hotel up to the next level of service. The restaurant excels in local dishes done with perfection. My wife loved the spa and some sort of treatment I didn’t follow but she was ecstatic. The cooking school is the perfect was to understand the culture , traditions and spices. And bonus there’s a private club with pool and off shoot of. cooking school.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2022,3,Disappointing second visit,"We were here five years ago and may our memory failed us but this time (5 couples) we all found the cleaning very sub standard, the carpets all need changing, the toiletries were awful, water went from hot to cold to steaming so irritating but also annoyingly it must operate on low voltage so hard to charge the phone and my Apple Watch couldn’t charge at all. Internet patchy. We can live with all that but not with not being super clean with super service at £400 a night. Just not right. They said they had a new wing but why would they not put us there then? They also need Organization and better management. Hotel is finally quite noisy. Location is great and staff nice. Breakfast need upgrading in quality not in volume.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Exquisite Riad in Marrakech,"We were on a private tour with Youssef of Morocco Expert Tours. He booked La Maison Arabe as our riad in Marrakech. What an excellent choice! The riad is exquisite with stunning Moroccan decor. The rooms have all the modern amenities. We ate dinner twice in the gorgeous indoor/outdoor dining room. The menu is diverse with traditional Moroccan as well as western dishes. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The riad is about 10-15 minutes walk from the main square for shopping. I wish we had stayed longer, I would have loved to try their hamman.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,Traditional & beautiful boutique hotel situated in a perfect location,"So happy we chose this over other more modern hotels and those further out of town. A very traditional, charming and historic boutique hotel situated inside the medina but close enough to walk to the modern parts of the city. We booked a regular suite with access to a forecourt but got upgraded to the three storey Chem suite, which was fabulous with a private rooftop terrace complete with a cabana & jacuzzi. It also gave us the convenience of two bathrooms and a huge living room. The hotel itself has lots of beautiful space, nooks, crannies and historic artefacts so be sure to explore. We tried the pool side Trios restaurant which serves a fusion so there should something for everyone on the menu. On the pricey side, portions aren’t that generous and a bit too quite out…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,Best hotel in Morocco,"I’d give a 7 out of 5 if possible This is the most spectacular hotel and room we’ve ever stayed in anywhere in the world! Our room is staggering. We have the entire floor including a balcony with chaise lounges and covered canopy. There’s a living room with fireplace and desk. Wine with crystal glasses as well as water in silver tumbler. The bedroom is out of a movie and the bathroom could be in a design magazine. Carved wood walls and a walk in closet built larger than most homes in Canada. The hotel is a maze- think Harry Potter meets Aladdin, with intriguing nooks and cranny’s everywhere. The restaurant offers fine dining at reasonable prices. Did I mention the cooking classes? Omg! And there a spa that’s just WOW! Oh, and happy hour in the courtyard.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,Small cookery class in a 5* hotel.,"We discovered that this 5* hotel offered cookery classes when one of my friends visited it several years ago for some mint tea, so we booked it. The class was brilliant, with the cookery demonstrator, Houda, and the workshops manager and interpreter, Simo, both being exceptional. We watched flatbreads being baked in a wood oven and drank mint tea while Simo explained how the day would progress. Off to the kitchen to meet Houda and bake some cookies before getting down to business. Everything was really well organised and explained and help was on hand while we cooked the chicken and lemon tagine, a hot tomato salad and an aubergine salad. There were 4 of us, so easy to watch the cook and easy to get help if necessary. We learned how to make flowers from the tomato skin - a case…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,Excellent,"Excellent hotel with a really cool history and phenomenal staff. We booked a suite, which was nice and spacious and the decor was wonderful. The only ding is that both of our rugs would definitely benefit from a deep cleaning (not just vacuuming). Other than that, this place was a lovely oasis in the medina and the breakfast was unbelievably good. We'd definitely stay again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,A cracking 3 night stay!,This is an amazing place in central Marrakech. Nothing was too much trouble. Room and restaurant were superb. One to stay at if you are in Marrakech! Haman was very good and the cooking class was one we would repeat again!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,A beautiful stay with unparalleled Moroccan hospitality and the best food in Marrakech,"My stay here was a dream. There’s a spirit of generosity and hospitality here I’ve not encountered anywhere else. The riad was built in the 1930’s and I couldn’t help but be swept away by the hotel’s history - oh, the things and people it has seen! I made sure to venture out to eat, hit the top spots recommended by Trip Advisor, but at the end of the day, the best food I had was right here in the hotel. I had a blissful Hammam/massage experience here, ten out of ten, and had a blast in the cooking class they offered. I’m usually an Airbnber, but this is one experience I’m so glad I went for. Thank you, La Maison Arabe for bringing such care and kindness to the art of hospitality.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Staff all very welcoming and friendly, and helped us everyday with booking/confirming tours, guides and taxis. The location was perfect for us as it could be accessed by car but was also only an 10 min walk from the main square. Our room was in a beautiful internal courtyard with stained glass windows. There was also a lovely spa and amazing cookery class offered by the hotel. Highly recommended for first time travellers to Marrakesh who want a lovely base from which to relax and explore!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2022,4,Authentic Marrakech comfort,"A truly authentic Moroccan hotel with beautiful rooms, courtyard tea areas, bar and restaurant. I didn't get to the hammam but wish I had - the space is magnificent and felt very private and intimate. The pool area is picturesque although loungers are on a different level. A bonus is this hotel is within walking distance of one of the main entrances into the medina (souk/market area) which was useful.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Excellent Hotel!,"This hotel is a gem. It is restored, tradition architecture and design. Each room is different and charming. The towels were amazingly soft. The jazz bar is cool.

We took the cooking class and it was the most informative, empowering and loving experience. Waffa and all the chefs were so informative and fabulous teachers!! Who knew I could make Moroccan food and it be delicious!! The chefs create such a fun, loving and bonding experience all while you cook. It was one of my favorite experiences while in Marrakech. Soukaina gave us a great tour! We also had lunch, visited the Jazz club and most especially had the Hammam experience at La Maison Arabe. No words can describe how fabulous this treatment is. It was life changing. I was reminded that I’m a Queen and was treated like one. It is the most beautiful spa ever I’ve ever seen. I loved…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2022,5,Beautiful Hotel in the Medina,We stayed here for 5 nights. We had an issue with our initial room but Abdil was very customer orientated and came to our rescue and did a great job by taking care of the room situation. The food is very good and so is the breakfast. Lots of variety. The hotel is close to almost everything you need or want to do in Marrakech. We had a hammam at this hotel and it was bliss. The hotel has a shuttle bus that takes you to a resort that's roughly 15 minutes away where it has a beautiful pool and great service. You can order lunch and drinks here. It was very relaxing and peaceful. We also participated in a cooking class which was excellent. We did a tour of the medina on our first day through the hotel and the tour guide was great. Would definitely recommend!!!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,A gem,"La Maison Arabe is an incredible riad and escape from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh! The riad is stunning and each room is a safe haven (we had 2 different rooms due to our travel plans). Being the first riad in Marrakesh gives it an authentic magic. The jazz bar with the live pianist is a perfect way to slow down and unwind, the tea foyer is a great spot to take a break and relax, and the restaurants are delicious! The spa was amazing, and I highly recommend a hammam/massage here. We also took a cooking class here, that was so fun and special. But what stands above everything was the staff! They were so welcoming and attentive. Every time we walked through the reception area we greeted with warm smiles and hellos. They are extremely helpful with any questions/needs,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Exceptional,"We cannot recommend La Maison Arabe too highly. Down a narrow passage off the road, stepping into it is like stepping into an oasis of calm and tranquillity after the madness and chaos of the souks of Marrakesh. A labyrinth of intimate cosy spaces leading off from the central courtyard each decorated in the Moorish tradition and carefully lit to bring out the best of the rich colours and textures. The cosy lounge area has a large picture of Sir Winston Churchill who was regular guest. The jazz bar has music as befits its name. Everywhere is immaculately cared for and maintained. Our room was on the compact side and the suitcases easily got in the way. But the room itself was very good and the bed super-comfortable. One small problem was that the bathroom was up an unguarded…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 October 2022,5,A wonder for all the senses.,"Stepping into La Maison Arabe is like stepping into Aladin's cave, one treasure followed by another. Each room is unique and beautifully decorated and appointed. We were delighted with our private little courtyard for late afternoon cocktails. From our delicious and refreshing welcome drinks (very welcomed) to any and every request being fulfilled, the staff were helpful and gracious. The spa and hammam were huge hits with several of the group booking multiple and repeat treatments. The dinner selection was wonderful and each meal was out of this world delicious.

 October 2022,5,"Outstanding residing in a historical palace, an architecure-artwork.","La Maison Arabe asked me to write a review about their house. I am happy to comply. To say it's just a historic riad would not do it enough credit. It is truly a venerable architectural work of art right in the centre, close to the souk alleys, a hidden gem. There is also modern technology in the house, the wifi is absolutely stable, flat screen in the room, but if you are looking for minimalist, contemporary furnishings, this is not the place for you. This riad has aged gracefully and wants you to continue to see its age. Nevertheless, everything has been neatly restored. The staff place a very high value on cleanliness. Even under the carpet tables, they are always wiped. Of course, every now and then there can be a small mistake, a little something can be forgotten. But with…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,One of the best,Best service. I am traveling now for nearly 40 years. The service was simply not topable. Thanks for the wonderful experience.

 September 2022,5,Stunning restaurant,"Our hotel concierge recommended Le Maison Arabe for dinner and we are glad he did. A short walk from our Riad we managed to get lost, but two local friendly children soon showed us the way!

Our server was excellent and made our evening very enjoyable, would thoroughly recommend this excellent restaurant.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2022,5,What an amazing hotel!,"La Maison Arabe - a beautiful riad with fantastic customer service. From the moment we stepped into the riad we were greeted by the friendly staff and offered a delicious non-alcoholic drink. We were upgraded to a spectacular room with a balcony overlooking the garden, pool and restaurants - such a pleasant surprise! The decor of the hotel is beautiful throughout. The food in the pool-side restaurant was perfect. Unfortunately we ran out of time and did not have an opportunity to experience the other restaurants but if the one we ate in was any indication...

 September 2022,5,Perfect hotel!,"We absolutely loved our stay at La Maison Arabe. When we first arrived the outside (like most in Morocco) didn't look like much, but step inside and it is absolutely beautiful! The staff without exception were so helpful and friendly. They knew guests by name and went out of their way to help. We used the shuttle bus to visit their country club one day - definitely recommended. It was a beautiful oasis away from the bustle of the city. The restaurant around the pool had a lovely atmosphere and great food. We also enjoyed nightly drinks in the cosy jazz bar. Don't stay anywhere else if you visit Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2022,5,Couldn't have been better,"We have just returned from a three week stay at La Maison Arabe - of which we cannot speak highly enough. We in turn were recommended it by friends who also appreciated the spotless housekeeping, exceptional food, magical hamman, stunning decor, proximity to places of interest and extremely helpful staff, who suggested ideas to ensure we saw the best of Marrakech. Add to this a courtesy shuttle to take you at your request to the annexed Country Club and you have the recipe for a perfect holiday.

Located at the entrance to the medican, made it quite easy to navigate our sightseeing during the day and return to a pleasant and quiet oasis. The team members were very friendly and accommodating. While I had one of the lower category rooms (since I was the single traveler in our group) the room was still extremely comfortable. The bed was comfortable and the shower pressure was great. The meals we had were wonderful. Breakfast was included in our room and was quite a delicious spread and able to eat outside poolside. The one group dinner we had was wonderful and delicious as well. The gym is very small and limited but I was able to locate a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,Wonderful stay,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in the beginning of our trip in Morocco, and should have stayed here at the end of our trip as well. Upon arrival, we not only received an upgrade of our room but also a bottle of wine and large bottle of water was included. Our room was large with good lighting and plenty of outlets for charging devices. Everything about this riad was excellent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast was beyond excellent. Although not included in the price, we ate dinner at their restaurant every night because the food was phenomenal. In addition to the various tagine's (which everyplace in Morocco has) the dinner menu included other dishes, Despite the fact we didn't use it, the La Maison Arabe also had a hammam, thereby…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

I picked this wonderful piece of paradise to stay at since it had everything - a riad that we got to explore, a hammam where we got a royal treatment in, a world-class cooking school where we learned to make traditional Morrocan dishes, two pools to lounge at, a sumptuous restaurant that served French, Morrocan and Asian dishes, and best of all, the friendliest, most helpful and delightful staff. We stayed at multiple 5-star hotels throughout our journey and this staff is the best yet. They arranged our tours for us to share their food, to teach us their rich culture and to take instagram photos. They went out of their way to make sure that my cousin and I had…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,My favourite place,"I cannot count the number of times I’ve stayed here and every time I leave I’m looking forward to the next time. I go with my best friend to enjoy the relaxation of the hotel and country club, but the position being in the old medina makes it a perfect place to explore from by foot too. Every member of staff is brilliant, so friendly, welcoming and attentive. We love to see them every year and so pleased the place is thriving after the last two horrible years for travel. It’s our home from home for sure. Until next year….Inchallah.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 July 2022,5,One of my best hotel experiences ever.,"Simply put, my stay at Le Maison Arabe was one of the absolute best experiences I have ever had while traveling. I'll start with the service. Every single one of the team members seemed genuinely happy to be there,focused on making sure that every need was met, and that I had a perfect experience. They are knowledgeable, kind and friendly, and were always patient with me as a first-time visitor to Morocco that had 100 questions a day. Special acknowledgement goes to Adil (who is the definition of anticipatory customer service), Raja, and Brahim. It would not surprise me if they were graduates of the St. Regis service program; they are that good. The facilities and spa are also absolutely top-notch. The design and local flavor are at once modern and timeless...I felt like…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2022,5,"Authentic, architectural gem","Where to start?! This lovely hotel is a standout among standouts from our two-week trip across Morocco. The service is first-class; the bar and dining room exude old-world elegance similar to what you'd find in Paris and New York; there are layers upon layers of art, tile and richly carved wood; and our room was fit for a king (request the Noor Suite 222 with its own roof top patio). We visited La Mamounia for dinner and I would stay here over there every time.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2022,5,Great experience with a very nice and accommodating staff,"This hotel is tucked away and very unassuming from the outside. Inside, it’s very quaint and the rooms are large and comfortable. Food is excellent and they have a menu that can accommodate various palettes. The staff is really nice and we’re very attentive. I truly appreciated the entire staff and will definitely recommend others to have a stay here if they are traveling to Marrakech. P.S. take advantage of the country club- just a short tram ride away to experience the quiet and relaxing pool area and cabanas. Staff and food there are excellent and was a very nice surprise.

 July 2022,5,"VERY impressive, a true oasis","This is a charming and beautifully maintained boutique hotel tucked away on a safe and quiet side street. We were impressed with the professionalism, warmth and friendliness of the staff. Our hammam treatments, meals and transportation were flawless. The front desk team is especially 5 star.

 July 2022,5,Hidden Gem & Impeccable Service,"We were a group of 11 executives from all over the US that were visiting Marrakech for the first time. We decided to arrive a few days before our meetings to explore the city on our own expense. Each one of us individually booked a room at this amazing property. We all have high expectations when we travel together, and we couldn't believe the outstanding service we received and how well maintained this property is in the Medina. We tried every experience the property offered; from the three hour cooking class to the spa (Hammam), to the mid-day tea service, and even went to the country club. We were floored at how amazing this place was. A big thank you to Mr. Jillou and Raja who made this personal/business trip the most memorable one. We booked personal transportation…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2022,5,Perfect Oasis in the Middle of the Medina,"La Maison Arabe was simply amazing. The location of the hotel in the Medina was perfect for access to the souks and sight seeing. The hotel is beautifully elegant & relaxing with exceptional staff, who could not be more friendly & helpful if they tried. No task was too small for them, from arranging guides, ordering taxi's or obtaining tickets. To compliment the city centre location, the hotel also has a beautiful country club with pool, approx 20 mins away, with a shuttle bus running every hour. Again the staff at the country club could not be more helpful or friendly. I could not recommend La Maison Arabe highly enough. A must for any stay in Marrakech!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2022,5,First time in Marrakesh not the last,First time in Morocco so wanted to see the city but still have a relaxing feel and found this hotel using trip advisor. La Maison Arabe did not disappoint. To say we had an amazing time in this beautiful hotel would be an understatement. Located ideally in the middle of the city and easy to find. The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for us and were so attentive. There is a swimming pool there but they also have one 15 mins away via a free hotel shuttle service which runs every hour. This pool is bigger and set in a beautiful hidden garden. Complementary drinks are given on arrival. They have food available with plenty of loungers and cabanas. My son and I booked a 3 hour tagline cooking class with the cookery school which is attached to the hotel. The teaching chef and translator…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 June 2022,5,Perfection,"What an amazing venue for our forth trip to Marrakech. Beautiful hotel with exquisite decor and antiquities. Lovely room (junior douiria) opening off a small courtyard. ALL the staff were so friendly and courteous and couldn't have been more welcoming. The Cookery school is a must- 3 hours later, a tasty tagine and salads to be consumed . The Spa was superb. The Royal Session was my first experience of a Hammam followed by a wonderful 45 minute massage. Such a beautiful setting for dining around the pool .Breakfast was a feast which we had to finish with a Moroccan pancake made to order by the poolside! The candlelit dining experience with the musicians playing was truly memorable. Can't recommend La Maison Arabe highly enough and certainly can't wait to return!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2022,5,Wonderful,"What a beautiful hotel. The staff is very kind and attentive. The artwork hung throughout is absolutely beautiful - and the place would be beautiful without artwork.

Sure there are bigger , flashier places here ..BUT ...what you will not find is a more passionate team and the elegant charm this place exudes...walking distance to the Medena is a plus ...simply beautiful spa ..and the food is superb in a tranquil setting around the inner sanctum pool. Highly recommend attending their cooking school to hone your tagine skills. Pre dinner drinks in the jazz bar ( Morrocan G&T) with live music is a must and easy to see why Sir Winston Churchill frequented the place. Now my favorite place to stay on the planet! Top marks to Adil and his team !",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2022,4,"Amazing service, pretty nice hotel","This upscale hotel (by Moroccan standards) has absolutely amazing food! The chef is probably the high point of the entire stay, especially his masterful rack of lamb available at each dinner. The breakfast buffet is also extensive. The hotel spa offers hammam (a Turkish bath), which is the unique experience of having your skin thoroughly scrubbed clean while relaxing in a steam room. This can be followed by a very relaxing but not very effective massage. As a warning, if you suffer from asthma, you’ll feel tremendous torture in the steam room, so skip the hammam. La Maison Arabe also has excellent proximity to Jemaa el-Fnaa Square where all the action is. There are a few downsides that prevent this from snagging a five-star rating. There are a lot of pigeons, which isn’t the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2022,5,Wonderful Stay at La Maison Arabe!,"We stayed at La Maison for 4 nights from May21-25 and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I first got to know of La Maison because in 2020 during the pandemic, I took up several online cooking lessons with them which I thoroughly enjoyed. They said YES to all my requests to learn even difficult dishes not on their usual menu list. Thanks to Souad (who was still there at that time), Haznah and the dear Dadas! The Riad was beautiful and we loved our douriya room with our own courtyard. We enjoyed the quiet and calm, and the service and staff were impeccable!

 June 2022,5,Long weekend in Marrakech,"We stayed at Maison Al Arabe for three nights, what a wonderful experience. The hotel itself is amazing, the pool at the hotel is a stunning setting, the restaurant was excellent, and the country club was worth the transfer time to experience a different setting. I want to commend all the staff, who went above and beyond for the whole duration of our stay - especially Ismail, who was extremely attentive, knowledgable and charming looking after our whole family. I would say this was the best hotel, and the best hotel experience, that our family has ever had. Well done Maison Al Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2022,5,Had the most excellent stay!,"My wife and I found La Maison Arabe on an Instagram influencer's YouTube channel. It looked like a spectacular and truly unique riad right on the edge of the Marrakech medina. We checked out the website, confirmed availability, ensured it was within our budget and then booked. The 3 night stay did not disappoint! The room, the staff, the food, the everything..5 stars all around. Truly a unique riad that felt very much like we were staying in a hotel unlike anything we could ever find in the USA. I'd akin this Riad to what Americans might expect from a St. Regis, Intercontinental or hotel of that caliber. But much more intimate. The staff defined the expression ""overdeliver"" and went that extra mile for us in every way. I'd strongly recommend this riad for anything…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The décor and attention to detail is superb, it was such a feast for the eyes. The staff is so incredibly kind, attentive, and helpful. The food, superb!

 May 2022,4,Lovely stay,Lovely stay and highly enjoyable. I spent five nights at La Maison Arabe. Very close to the souks and the main square. The setting with the pool surrounded by the restaurant was idyllic. Food in les Trois Saveurs for dinner excellent in particular the fish tagine which was divine and the chicken with lemon and olives running it a close second. The salads need more variety as it did get a little boring. The service was fantastic and the staff were brilliant throughout the hotel. The rooms were well looked after just a little tired and in need of a refresh and I utterly loved the country club. I am a keen cook so admittedly I did think the cookery school a little pedestrian although I felt the staff were warm and friendly there. Spa treatments excellent,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The rooms are all individual and very well appointed. The staff are exceptionally helpful and arranged excellent trips on request. The pool area is small but the associated out of town garden pool is just 15 mins away by shuttle bus and has resort type pool. This place is also very peaceful and does a nice lunch. Food was good in the main hotel. The 3 hour cookery school was a bit slow for an experienced cook but would be excellent for beginners. The bars and public areas in the hotel are very nice. Service was excellent throughout.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2022,5,Magical Stay/Awesome Experience,"It was my first time to Morocco and everyone recommended staying in a riad in the Medina. We couldn't have chosen a better one than La Maison Arabe. It was full of Moroccan charm and culture. We stayed in a junior room with our own douriya. The food was delicious but above all, the service was outstanding. From arranging tour guides and cars at a moment's notice to remembering our requests - the staff was just exemplary. A special shout out to Adil, Mourad, Hakim, Ismail, DRiss, Raja, Aziz, Mehdi and Ahmed - you guys rock and show what true customer service is all about. Would love to go back!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2022,5,Sublimely Wonderful and Amazing,Spent three nights at La Maison Arabe at the end of a trip through Morocco. Arrived exhausted at the end of a long travel day and was whisked to our room with an easy check-in. Everything flowed similarly from there with attention and help from the very welcoming and warm staff - from helping with our (many) bags to directions to the incredible hammam (incredible is an understatement) - I would happily stay at La Maison Arabe again and again.

 May 2022,5,Highly recommended hotel that meets all the detail to make your stay in Marrakesh brilliant!,"This is a lovely little boutique hotel with a great location. I have visited this hotel before and eaten several tikes as well (an old haunt of Winston Churchills). We were given walk around after a very refreshing welcome Moroccan juice in the courtyard which was a very tranquil setting with the birds flying above into the open and a soothing sound of the central fountain. We managed to book a last minute slot in the hamman which i must say is up there with the other ones I have had during my other 5 trips to Marrakesh. It is extremely good value and we also had a massage (again one of the best i have had). The room was spacious and nice. The outside approach, the carved door and the interior decor was lovely. The only thing I would add was they should provide 2 caffeinated…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2022,5,A luxurious escape that nevertheless keeps you aware of exactly where you are,"Our Junior Suite in the Maison Arabe was quiet and private, two things which are very important to us, especially in busy Marrakech.

The staff were more than happy to help. The room was similarly tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Dinner in the restaurant was exquisite (I still dream about the Tanjia a la Marrachia). Breakfast was also very enjoyable, sat right next to the swimming pool. The stay was made even better with a visit to the Maison Arabe cooking school next door. The only downside to the stay was that it was only for one night. I look forward to coming back and staying longer!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2022,5,La Maison Arabe is a must stay when in Marrakesh,"After 4 days hike in the Toubkal national park, we needed a day in Marrakesh to rest and contemplate. We arrived after breakfast, we’re served coffee and fresh orange juice at the pool. In their SPA we had relaxing massage and spent a day on the rooftop. Dinner was another treat, obligatory to reserve in advance, because it was full. After dinner a night cup is a must have in their Jazz club. Rooms and the whole hotel are example of wonderful arabic architecture with all the coridors, stairs, amaizing furniture. Last but not least thier staff is very friendly, obliging in all your needs.

Lots of attention to detail given to the decor which we really admired! Good location in Medina, we were able to walk to a lot of the main tourist sights. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. They organised our day trip to the mountains and prepped us well as to what we should expect the walk to the waterfalls would be like. Breakfast was nice, again authentic cuisine which is exactly what we wanted! Amazing Hammam spa - definitely must visit! Only disadvantage is that the swimming pool on site doesn’t look like it can be used as it’s by the restaurant and the 2nd swimming pool is in a different location.

This trip had been planned well over a year ago and was incredibly important for me as both parents battled cancer during COVID and was planned and cancelled multiple times. It was critical that we selected the ""perfect"" accommodations, and I can tell you that La Maison Arabe exceeded all my expectations! The riad itself is beyond gorgeous. Even though I researched thoroughly, viewed all the videos on Youtube, followed them on IG, looked through reviews regularly on TripAdvisor....nothing prepares you from experiencing it in person.

 March 2022,5,Exceptional Authentic Experience,"La Maison Arab is a beautiful Riad hotel with exceptionally helpful and friendly staff. We arrived very late at night, and even then the service was 5* with refreshing welcome drink and friendly smile. We have been very lucky in that we’ve travelled all over the world and this hotel easily ranks among the best we’ve experienced. Not far from the central medina, it’s a reasonably easy walk to most of the main sights. Good advice was given by the staff with regards to bartering with vendors and taxi drivers and all of the dinner recommendations proved to be excellent.

Room had a king size bed that was comfy and outfitted with a lot of pillows. Staff at the hotel were friendly and attentive. We were invited by our tour guide to a dinner in his village outside Marrakech and we asked the front desk if they could provide us with a cake last minute. and they happily provided us with a cake within 30 min - it was a delicious chocolate mousse cake that was a hit with our tour guide and his family.

The design was beautiful.. The attention to detail by the entire team was outstanding. The service was amazing! We began our stay with a refreshing glass of juice (just calling it juice diminishes the beauty and flavor, it was great) in the beautiful courtyard. We then enjoyed the services of the Hammam at their spa. This is a ""must do"", especially after our flight (we had a seven hour delay in Paris but that is another story).

 October 2021,5,Wonderful stay in Marrakech,"Super friendly staff, great food, lovely room, great spa. The entire property is beautiful.

 August 2021,5,A gem in the heart of Marrakesh,"This riad is stunning. There is a truly dedicated and welcoming team. Not only is the hotel beautiful, but it has a warmth that makes staying here a pleasure. Small and intimate is often better than a large and sometimes impersonal hotel. Not to forget the restaurant! A destination location for many people, it augmented my stay enormously. I enjoyed many amazing meals in the restaurant and in my room. The setting is stunning as it’s next to the pool. There are many other features including a cooking school, hammam, and a second, very private, beautiful swimming pool situated in a gorgeous garden (with food available) 15 minutes from the hotel (well worth the hotel shuttle ride!)

 May 2021,5,Highly recommend - had a wonderful stay,This accomodation was my favourite (out of the 7 different places we stayed at on this trip). Rooms - very clean with a luxurious yet traditional feel. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a junior suite and the room was very large with a separate sitting area and a private terrace overlooking the pool. Service - was excellent. Staff were so attentive and personable and must have been briefed prior to our arrival because they all seemed to be across where we were from and our room no. etc from the moment we got there. Such personal service that made us feel like we were important! Food - blew me away. Their lamb cous cous was so yum (had it 3 times) and their non-moroccon menu is also great quality.

The property is beautiful, the room was quite lovely and the historic restaurant first class. The staff were extremely friendly and competent and made us feel immediately at home. As a riad in the Medina it was within easy walking distance of all the main attractions of Marrakech, something that the larger resort hotels can't offer. An added bonus is their country club, which is a beautiful desert retreat. The riad has an hourly shuttle that services the country club, perfect for a relaxing pool day or you can, as we usually did, enjoy the large pool at the main property to cool off after a day visiting one of the local tourist sites.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

We got free a small bottle of Moroccan wine and a large bottle of water in our room. And they sent us off to airport with a small bottle of water and a small box of delicious pastries. I loved walking around the hotel to discover its beautiful windows, doors and ceilings. We had a Hamamm included in our package and it was divine.

Even though we booked the smallest room, we loved everything about the stay. There was a delicious welcome drink, afternoon tea each day, and a complimentary bottle of wine in the room. We took a class in the cooking school and each did treatments at the Hammam. Everything was absolutely top notch. The man who works at the front desk each day is amazing.

The place is crammed with beautiful objects from the previous owner's collections,some of the public rooms with leather clad walls, and the poolside dining comes into its own, see my review of the restaurant. Breakfasts are also very good with lots of choice. The staff are really helpful, Raja, Rashida, Moran, and Aziz in the restaurant to name just a few. They got us taxis and agreed the price for us.

We were really lucky to find Maison Arabe that had it all plus in walking distance to the Souks and other places we wanted to see. We were deeply impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and more than pleasantly surprised with the beauty and comfort of our suite. We had the best lamb we ever ate anywhere else and only ventured once to eat elsewhere during the entire 4 day stay, it just could not have been better.

The rooms,food and facilities are first class.The care that the staff take to ensure every element of your stay is perfect goes above and beyond anything I have experienced in 5 star hotels. Particular praise must go to Raja, who was always exceptionally helpful and efficient on the front desk-even sharing my taxi on her way home to show me where the shopping mall was. Adil Chanif, also on the front desk,arranged for my mattress and pillows to be changed as I found the synthetic filling too hot. The beauty therapists in the spa gave me a wonderful hammam and the best pedicure I have ever had-my polish still looks perfect a month later! Finally,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,This is a perfect hotel.,"We stayed at La Maison Arabe for a friend's 50th birthday weekend. The hotel was exceptional in handling the needs of a group of 30 and did not miss a beat. We stayed there again after the celebrations, and it was equally as perfect. From the intimacy to the decor, the food, the service and the rooms there was absolutely nothing that I would change about our stay. The staff is lovely. I have travelled all over the world and this ranks as one of my all time favorite places.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2020,2,Not worth it for the price - pool too cold to swim,I chose this hotel (it’s more of a hotel than a riad) as they had a heated swimming pool. I have enjoyed heated outdoor pools during winter months in my travels so I emailed the hotel specifically to confirm this. However it was barely heated and certainly not enough to swim- the front desk staff who gave me a tour concurred stating “yes too cold to swim” - the weather was mild at 62degrees with full sun but the pool is in the shade and not heated enough. What a disappointment! The junior suite was ok but not five star. It has the old world charm but lacks any personal touch. The patio faces little courtyard but you are directly facing other rooms and no views so I don’t imagine ever spending time there. The courtyards are small therefore don’t expect the typical Moroccan airy…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Fabulous,"We travel a lot and this hotel is one of my favourites anywhere. The hotel architecture is beautiful, and interesting, and the facilities (room service, restaurant, hammam, piano bar, the riads and lovely sitting areas) made it very difficult to go anywhere other than stay in the hotel and relax. With all that said, the best part of the hotel was the service. Thank you for a great stay.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Beautifully decorated hotel,"All of the common spaces in this hotel were amazing and beautifully decorated. Our room was spacious with a seating area and balcony overlooking the pool and a large bathroom. The people at the front desk were very helpful and gave us cookies and bottled water for the road when our driver for the airport arrived. We also enjoyed the piano bar, where you can listen to piano music and order from a fairly extensive menu.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2019,5,"Authentic, atmospheric, outstanding!","La Maison Arabe is one of the finest hotels in Marrakech, not only due to the five star luxury in every element of its presentation and service, but because of its history and authenticity. It is an Escher painting maze of steps and corridors, with stunning rugs, furniture and a seamless combination of Moorish and Islamic architecture. Upon arrival, Hakim ushered us down terracotta brick stairs to the patio where we were treated to a cool mint, pineapple juice and ginger welcome drink – refreshing and consumed in an instant! The patio has a central water feature of azure tiles and a flower-filled marble bowl providing a subtle gurgle and splash of water. Cushioned sofas and chairs for guests’ leisure furnish each corner, and is where afternoon tea is enjoyed while a musician…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Beautiful hotel with amazing service!,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were very impressed with the stunning facilities.

I was sorry to leave and I think many other guests were too!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Four days of relaxation after a long trip through the country.,"Great hotel and great service. Good location, beautiful property and phenomenal service. The rooms vary greatly in size with several looking over the garden. Our room did not have a view but we were rarely in it because the hotel provides so many places to sit, read a book, or enjoy a drink. Sad to leave.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Tranquil Luxury in Busy Marrakech,"Everything at this riad-hotel is perfect. The location, the friendly staff, the buildings, the guest rooms, the FOOD, etc. I spent 6 nights here and will happily do so again in the future. I cannot say enough about the hotel's food at the restaurants - It was amazing. The staff remembered our names and room numbers, as well as preferences and were incredibly accommodating throughout the entire trip.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,4,Atmospheric stay in a great location,"We spent 6 nights at this hotel on our first visit to Marrakech. Our initial suite was quite dark/atmospheric and looked out onto a small courtyard, beautiful in the middle of the day but very messy once the local bird life had spent a couple of hours in the tree there. We asked for a room with more daylight and transferred to a lovely room on the top floor with a balcony - perfect! The hotel is within easy walking distance of all that we wished to visit (the YSL garden and museum was a highlight) and we also spent a day at the hotel’s country club, which provided a contrast to the city hustle and bustle. The hotel’s 2 restaurants provided varied and enjoyable food.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Excellent,Excellent Moroccan Hotel facility. Very good service and rooms are large sized with all amenities. Gym is somewhat limited but acceptable. Restaurant also very good. Spa services are reasonably priced and the massage was excellent. Only complaint with spa was what it was a little cold and noisy because bar is upstairs,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2019,5,Cannot praise it too much!,"La Maison Arabe was a great welcome on our first stop in Morocco. The service was impeccable and the staff always friendly and attentive.

 December 2019,5,If you love the Napa Valley food vibe...,"If you love the Napa Valley food vibe...Then this is the place for you to stay in Marrakech! La Maison Arabe offers luxurious Moroccan decor and spacious, updated bathrooms. Everywhere you turned it looked like a photograph from Architectural Digest. There are displays of sweet Moroccan oranges everywhere. Food is absolutely delicious. The hotel is known worldwide for its cooking school. We so enjoyed our poolside dinner in the interior courtyard as well as our breakfast there. Tea was served upon arrival. Well-Located inside the medina and easily accessible near its edge. There have been additions over the years and there are stairs in many directions. I was happy that we had requested a room near the elevator. We told Hakim, who gracefully handled our family’s checkout,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2019,5,Luxury nestled in the beautiful Medina of Marrakech,"Marrakech and La Maison Arabe was the last stop of our Moroccco trip and it was definitely one of the best experiences we had in Morocco. The boutique hotel is actually a Riad that has been repurposed into a luxury boutique hotel complete with a heated pool, spa and hammam, jazz bar and a couple of restaurants (of which one wasn’t working though) The approach roads to LMA are quite nondescript and quite underwhelming. But once inside, you cannot help bring transfixed with the elegance and royal old world charm of the place. Our room was quite spacious, had a nice balcony and the bathroom was quite nice too (it didn’t have shower only room though). There were enough windows to keep open at night if you are into fresh air rather than aircon and there was a TV set too (which…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2019,5,Amazing food in a Beautiful Riad in the Middle of Marrakesh,"Absolutely loved everything about their place from the unsuspecting entrance leading into a beautiful Grand Riad. Amazing food, we have the Tagine de beouf with Prunes and Apricot. It was out of this world. Mouthwatering Beef that just fall off the Bone. We will be back again for sure.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2019,5,Amazing Hotel Experience,My family and I stayed here for my mother’s 60th birthday and I have to say this hotel was just perfect. The staff at this hotel will go the extra mile to make each experience special. The restaurant food had several choices of American/ Moroccan food and I have to say it was extraordinary! Our room had a lovely fireplace which was perfect for a winter night. I highly recommend this hotel to those looking to stay in Marrakech!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2019,5,Top Spa Experience,My husband and I enjoyed a magical hammam and massage experience at La Maison Arabe last week (which we came across quite by accident - we were walking through the medina and followed a sign that intrigued us). A beautiful setting and a wonderful team - we'll certainly be back!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Amazing Hotel,Everyone on the hotel staff was very courteous and friendly. they upgraded our room upon arrival and gave us a free bottle of wine. Their restaurants and bars served delicious food and drinks. The front desk even bought us a bus ticket for a later part of our trip by sending a bell boy to the bus station late at night. Our hotel was cleaned multiple times a day and we always had a fresh water bottle in our room. Room was very clean. Breakfast every morning was a treat. Definitely would stay at this hotel again.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Beautiful Facility; Great Staff,"Just spent three evenings at this facility. Absolutely beautiful. The interior design of the common areas is magnificent. The staff was absolutely top-notch. After 10 days of eating wonderful Moroccan food, it was nice to enjoy their ""international"" menu, which was superb. The facility has an off-site ""country club"" with the swimming pool, events venue, and restaurant. We spent a long day there and found it to be very refreshing.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,Beautiful small hotel with great service,"We were fortunate to stay three nights in Marrakech at the Maison Arabe. The hotel is very well located, near the main square. The common rooms are beautifully decorated.The breakfast at the hotel is an elaborate buffet served by a lovely swimming pool. The hotel restaurants have great food. There is a cooking school at the hotel, which is excellent. The hotel rooms are nicely furnished and many have outdoor patios or terraces. I would highly recommendthis charming hotel in Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,A great hotel!,"The lap of luxury. We had a big, L-shaped suite, but I am sure a room would have been spacious too. (The only thing I didn't like about it was that living room was completely separate and down a hall from the bathroom -- but this would have had advantages in other situations). Room was very quiet. Hotel service was extremely friendly and competent. Hammam was a memorable experience. Dinner was delicious. The one thing to be aware of is that this is a hotel experience, not far into the medina (as opposed to a more distinctive, smaller guesthouse).",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Best meal and hammam,Our first night after a long flight we decided to book a hammam there and had dinner there prior. We couldn’t have asked for a better start to our Morocco vacation. Top notch all the way. Highly suggest starting you vacation this way.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Amazing service and perfect dinner,The hotel is absolutely stunning and we chose to have dinner at the resturant by the pool but what really made the night for us is the amazing service given to us by Aziz. He really looked after us and we felt that he gave special care to make the evening a special night. I highly recommend this restaurant at this hotel 👌👌👌,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,The perfect dinner,"Beautiful place, delicious food, warm ambiance with live music, and exceptional service. Special thanks to Mr. Abdellatif who gave us the best service we cold have asked her. I even put him up to the challenge of doing something special for my boyfriend's birthday, but without cake... He brought a big, delicious ice cream dessert with candles, and sang Happy Birthday with his colleagues - really appreciated the gesture. Thanks again, and hope to come back soon!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,An excellent place to stay with great service,"I had two separate experiences at La Maison Arabe, both excellent and my favourite in Marrakech. First, I attended a cooking class hosted by Yomna and dada Fatiha. It was a great experience and an enjoyable way to learn more about Moroccan cuisine and culture. The kitchen, its appliances and instructional tools (e.g., monitor at each station) were top-notch but most of all, Yomna and Fatiha made everything fun. After visiting other parts of Morocco, I returned to Marrakech and had the privilege of staying at La Maison Arabe for a couple days. I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite spread across two floors plus a rooftop terrace with a jacuzzi. The bed was super comfortable, the showers and tubs had plenty of hot water and good water pressure, and the couches were…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,"Excellent Service , Kind Staff","We stayed at this beautiful Riad for a friend’s Birthday celebration for a duration of 5 nights. From day 1 the General Manager did everything in his power to make our stay special. Starting with booking and then our reception upon arrival and taking care of every single small detail during our stay. From dinner reservations ,to transportation, to room service and more. The staff made sure we never overpaid for taxis by prenegotiating on our behalf. When we fell in love with some silverware in our room, the staff made sure we found what we needed and even went shopping for us and brought items back. The staff is exceptionally kind, attentive and generous. The General Manager is obviously doing an amazing job to have a staff who does everything whole heartedly. We could not…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Lovely Place to stay,"Staff was always helpful and the Riad was very clean and beautifully decorated. You really feel like you are in Moroccan luxury. The Hamman is just the right thing for after a day of walking the many alleys of the Médina. Rooms are small but inviting, especially when you arrive and are greeted by rose petals on your bed and in the bath. The dining rooms are lovely. The food is quite good but overpriced. AND ....attending the cooking school should not by missed!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Restaurant review,We phoned to book but they then couldn’t find the reservation when we arrived so they put us in the bar until a table became available. Don’t be put off by the street to get to the hotel. Once inside the building is incredible. We ate inside but there was also a garden restaurant. Menu not extensive but food was great. We would definitely consider staying here in future.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Wonderful introduction to Marrakech,Hotel is great with a wonderful restaurant. It is immediately welcoming and fun to stay in an old house converted into a hotel with the obligatory garden. The textiles and stone work are stunning. It feels calm and welcoming right inside the Medina.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Cooking class,"We didn’t stay at the hotel but we did book the cooking course. A great way to spend a half day . I’m more Alf Ramsey than Gordon Ramsey in the kitchen but this was thoroughly enjoyable. The lesson was informative, surprisingly well organised and everyone was well supported by the course leaders and their assistants. And of course at the end everyone sits down to enjoy their meals in a communal and sociable setting. Highly recommend this.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Cooking class,"We had a fantastic cooking class experience in a gorgeous place, the staff was very kind and friendly. The introduction to the marrocan cuisine, the type of spices and the tea cerimony were very interesting. Everyone was enthusiastic!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,"Awakening the senses! Be prepared to be amazed, and plan for your next visit!",I can only say senses are being awaken after my stays in this perfect Riad Sight - impressive Sound - music at Jazz Bar or restaurants Taste - remember to make booking in advance Touch - try Hammam Smell - enrol cooking class Extra point is very warm hospitality! Professional services and all the staffs speak good command of English. Love the friendliness of the staffs there!!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Beware Room Category,"Although the Hotel is quite beautiful if you don’t have the right room category the rooms are very small. For example, your knees will touch the wall when you are on the toilet, to be specific. The suites are fabulous. Good restaurants, lovely breakfast, caring and attentive staff.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Like Mary Poppins: Practically Perfect in Every Way!,"I cannot say enough good things about this establishment. It is absolutely stunning, service impeccable, food and beverages excellent. One of the finest boutique hotel in which I have stayed. We spent a lot of time in the bar, dined in the poolside restaurant, took the shuttle to their country club, and used the spa. We booked late and got the last room available at the time. It was super small, so we inquired if there might be something bigger. They moved us twice, so each night we slept in a different room, which was actually kind of fun and we were able to experience a range of rooms. Bigger is better but all three rooms were immaculate and the staff moved our belongings each day, so we just collected a new key upon our return from a day exploring the awesome city of…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,True experience,"Amazing place for couples. Romantic, traditional Raid style , not too modern but amazing service. We stayed for 2 nights and got the suite and it was totally worth it. They gave us great ideas of stuff to do around and it has a great location for walking to main places",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,Beautiful Spot in Marrakech,"Only had the pleasure of staying here one night at the end of a 2 week trip through Morocco and it was an absolute delight. Beautiful room, stunning public spaces and attentive staff. My only regret is I didn’t get to stay longer. Don’t hesitate to stay here.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,One of the best hotels Morocco has to offer.,"We stayed here four nights total at either end of a 15 day tour. It is a bit of a hike to the Medina but there are interests along the way. Great room, great breakfast, great restaurant, great service.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,Amazin palace,"The hotel was clean, the room's and bathrooms are a good size, breakfast was okay and the roof terrace is a nice spot to relax and get some sun. The staff were really friendly, gave us a great welcome - meeting our airport transfer, giving us tea on arrival and answering all our questions. Also really helpful with recommendations and direction me throughout our stay.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,Loved this place,"Spent 3 nights here - wish we could have spent more. The place is beautifully designed and our room was huge with lovely balcony overlooking the pool. The restaurant was so delicious, we ate here twice. Breakfast buffet was plentiful with lots of choices. The service impeccable.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,An experience of excellence,"It is rare that one experiences a hotel that surpasses every expectation, but Maison Arabe in Marrakesh does just this and far more. In a setting that exemplifies the best of Arabe/Berber architecture and culture the courteous and personalized service of highly professional staff is without equal. Having experienced hotels such as the Ritz Carlton we can say without reservation that this hotel was the best we ever stayed in. Both management and staff are world class. In addition, the two restaurants offer superior cosmopolitan and Moroccan fare. The Jazz Bar is equal to anything in Paris or New York and musicians playing at Maison Arabe do so at a polished level of musicianship and sophistication, an unexpected and enjoyable experience. Christine and Paul from Boston",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,Feel like a Sultan or a queen,"So this was a splurge but I liked the website and the location. The reality was better that all my expectations Our only regrets were that we only had 4 days and that we didn't hit the country club sooner. Food was really good, the staff seem to all speak four languages or more, and every one should experience a hammam at least once (and be hooked for life).",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,Amazing Stay,"We spent 4 nights in this riad and entire stay was perfect. The room was excellent with a pool view. Bathroom is perfect. The service is amazing. Everyone tries to help, show around. We asked where is the nearest ATM, the receptionist walked us there. Their international restaurant is very tasty as well as front desk personal suggestions for dining were excellent. The spa is very inviting and the service is very good. We also enjoyed riad's country club. The location is between old and new cities - so waling is required, but there are plenty of taxis and horse riding.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,Very elegant and picturesque,"This 26 room riad is a little haven of oeace in busy Marrakech, well located alongside the medina. Our first room was a superior suite and excellently laid out but the second one, a standard room oddly accessed by a long, steep staircase inside the room, was a bit too small. The restaurants are very good, one pleasantly placed alongside the small pool. There is a large pool available on another property also belonging to the Maison Arable, about 20 minutes drive away with the hôtel 's shuttle van. The cooking school is also excellent, very professional, and the staff friendly and efficient.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,stunning riad,"this is the king of riads in my opinion. The furnishings are awesome, also the restaurant is good and the service exceptional even for Morocco where standards of service are high. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Marrakesh",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,Cooking class,"In September 2019, I took a cooking class to learn how to make a lemon chicken tagine, along with 2 side dishes (1 hot, 1 cold), a bread, and a dessert. The set-up was surprisingly high-tech with monitors at our work stations to help see what the instructors were doing. They also circulated among us, with added guidance, extra spices, and, generally to make sure we were understanding. Every student had his/her own set-up with tools, spices, two burners (1 for the tagine, 1 for a skillet to prep the veggie side dishes), and a sink. At the end, we enjoyed our dishes at communal tables. In short, a great way to meet fellow travelers who share a passion for Moroccan food. 5-star experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,Wonderful Hotel,"I have traveled all over the world and have stayed in fancy hotels and very basic places. La Maison Arabe was the best by far. The service was excellent, especially by “Harry Potter.” He was so kind and welcoming, and not at all snobby, as they can sometimes be in 5 star hotels. The hotel itself is beautiful and charming, a combination of several riads. It was an oasis of serenity in the midst of the chaos of Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,Wonderful Meal in Magnificant Surroundings,"We ate dinner at this restaurant, one of Marrakech's best. the setting is magnificent with tables around a pool with abundant landscaping. The food is extraordinary with a variety of choices on the menu. Dining here is relatively expensive, but the quality and the setting more than justifies the prices. Very desired, so advance reservations are absolutely necessary. A ""can't miss"" dining experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2019,5,Wonderful Stay,"From the moment I arrived until I checked out, I felt very welcome. The staff were very helpful: recommending places to visit, arranging tours, following up on my missing luggage from the airline etc. The cooking class was exceptional. The room was very nice: appreciated the roses, complimentary wine and room upgrade. Despite the negative start to my trip having lost my luggage, I enjoyed every moment I spent in Marrakech thanks to the lovely staff @ la maison arabe. I will certainly be visiting again. xo",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,Paradise Hidden in an Alley,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel. As soon as I walked into the place, I received a very warm welcome from the friendly and professional staff; and felt as if I entered into a hidden paradise. Our room was very spacious and has a balcony from where I could see the pool and listen to the lovely live music in the evening. The poolside restaurant served delicious and inspired local and international menus. I am absolutely impressed by their attention to details and fine-touch to make guests feel welcomed. Highly recommended.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,Moroccan cooking class,"My son and I spent a wonderful afternoon learning some Moroccan cooking and then eating the results. Two very charming ladies - Fahita the chef, and Hasna the cooking class manager patiently showed us how to cook our own local bread, Tajine and vegetable dishes as well as an amazing Pastilla dessert made with blossom water. At the end we were both presented with a small Tagine to take home and a chef certificate. A very hands on afternoon and we learnt some handy secrets such as how to correctly prepare mint tea, preserve lemons and roast capsicums. We would highly recommend the class to anyone with an interest in cooking.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 August 2019,5,The Best!!!,"This hotel was amazing! Far better than the 5* chain hotels I usually visit. I stayed here for a week with my best friend and we had a fantastic holiday thanks to all the staff who helped and advised us. All staff were so friendly and helpful. The rooms and hotel itself is very traditional, clean and beautiful. The food at the hotel (breakfast, lunch and dinner) was delicious. Great location, you can walk to the main square and to the new Marrakesh areas. Very relaxing atmosphere. The spa was perfect and the cooking class was a great experience. The private pool area was very calm with very friendly and polite staff. The overall service of this hotel was the best I’ve seen around the world.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2019,5,Marrakech Trip,"I stayed nine days at Maison Arab. Management must be applauded because this level of service and attentiveness does not happen by accident. Rooms were impecably clean and redone everyday. Service was personal and attentive. The Hammam was outstanding, clean and refreshing. The Restuarant and staff were “on it” and service was top notch. They have an off-site pool that sounds like a weird idea until you get there and then it is such an oasis of calm and it is literally 10-15 minutes from the hotel. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention two people that made me feel at home. Rasheeda, who manages the Restuarant (and it appears other things): she made me feel welcome and she was attentive to all the guests and theirs questions. Finally, Maurad. He is the afternoon and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special and all the staff made sure we had a very relaxing few days, nothing was too much trouble. It’s our second time here and have been going to Marrakech for the past ten years, I have to say this riad is without doubt the best! The Country Club is wonderful!! We also ate in the restaurant every night and the food and ambiance were just lovely. We can’t wait to return next year!!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2019,5,Best Place Ever,"It was 6 of us that stayed at La Maison Arabe for 8 days. From the time we were picked up from the airport until our departure everyone was so accommodating! I absolutely enjoyed staying here! Rajaa at the front desk is amazing and knows all the best spots to eat! We saw Souleymane every morning for breakfast and he greeted us with a smile every day! Ishmael was at the front desk upon our arrival and each and every time we went out for an adventure...when we returned he always asked how our adventure was. We had scheduled many daily trips and always went over time. I must give a shout out to Yusef , our driver because he was so patient with our group.

 August 2019,5,Exquisite hotel in Old Town Marrakech,"Incredible place with a unique history and phenomenal architecture. Staff were amazing. Couldn’t have asked for a better hotel.

 August 2019,5,Great Hotel in Marrakech,"We spent three nights in this lovely riad, and it was a terrific choice in every respect. The staff were incredibly helpful and kind thoughout our stay, arranging everything from a very competent guide to cooking classes and excellent massages. The food was excellent as well and much better priced than some of the other fancy restaurants we visited... And the rooms, overall ambiance and beautiful interior were unique and authentically Moroccan. Even the workout facility was designed in Moroccan style and pretty good. You can spend a lot more money at Mamounia, the Royal Mansour or the Four Seasons, but you won’t have a better experience than at Maison Arabe. We will definitely return.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2018,5,Beautiful Riad,"We loved the location, the food and the service! We also took the cooking class, which is located at La Maison school next door. There is a discount for hotel guests. The pool was very pretty and we enjoyed a little time relaxing there. We would definitely go back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2019,5,"Stunning property, amazing food, decent service.",Before our stay at La Maison Arabe we were couchsurfing in the UK in the apartment of a few friends so we decided to splurge for four nights here. No regrets! We were upgraded to a massive room with a separate living area. The room came with a decent mini bar which we never availed of and a complementary bottle of wine which was a nice touch. The in-house restaurant was fab and the free breakfast every morning was amazing and probably my favorite thing about our entire stay. The pool area which is just off the restaurant is perfect also. Small but suitable for the property; would have been nice if it was temperature controlled as it was cold the two-times we swam but perhaps this is intentional to help cool you off from the Moroccan heat. The hotel was also very nice and…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 July 2019,5,Great food and service,"The restaurant in this hotel was recommended by the staff in the Riad we stayed in. Great service, lovely food, musicians added to the atmosphere and reasonably priced.

 July 2019,5,Amazing,"We stayed here July 2019 and cannot say enough good things about the hotel and the staff. Accomadations were 5 star, attention to detail is incredible and the staff is amazing. Don't book any guides prior to your trip, the hotel will help you with these arrangements once you arrive. The hotel is beautiful, but the staff truly makes your stay here memorable.

 July 2019,5,Express Cooking class - terrific!,"Had an amazing time with a small group at La Maison Arabe doing a 1hr cooking class. Fantastic set up in the teaching kitchens - wish my domestic science was like this at school. Great hospitality, relaxed, humorously led by Mohammed & Ayouda. Assisted by 2 lovely other staff too, sorry I didn’t catch your names. In Medina but thankfully accessible to the door by taxi too so didn’t have to navigate souks/medina squares on foot. Then we ate our own creations! Would have liked to add starters/desserts & wine to our dinner, maybe we could if we’d asked. But great value & a memorable experience to take home from our lovely time in Marrakech!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2019,5,A little oasis,"Stayed here for three nights with family of 5 adults. Couldn’t find fault with anything. Excellent food, location and in particular their staff. Very well located and beautiful decor throughout. We liked it so much we’ve cut short our trip to the coast near Casablanca to return for the weekend before we head home.

 July 2019,5,Wonderful 4 nights,"We stayed at this wonderful establishment for 4 nights. The staff can not do enough for you.

We took advantage of the country club pool,very relaxing with a nice lunch there. We also took the cooking class and had a Hamman spa experience.

 July 2019,5,Last few days of holiday - great choice - perfect,"We spent the last few days of our holiday here and it was perfect. The hotel is truly 5 star and nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff - which actually is what makes it. Had meal at the hotel on my birthday (steak is brilliant) and the staff sang to me with a candle in a cake! Perfect location to explore, close to other restaurants and the souk. We made the most of the country club and visited it a number of times, we ate there at lunch too, the staff were just great. We visited in June/July, temperature around 34 degrees. We didn't use the hotel pool as it's surrounded by the restaurant so you can't really sit around it but didn't need to, getting to the country club is so easy, 10 - 15mins away by a bus put on by the hotel, not what I'd wanted at all but…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2019,5,"Amazing stay, amazing property, amazing staff","I just returned from 7 nights at La Maison Arabe. A big part of what made my trip to Marrakech such an epic adventure was a lovely stay in the Ali Baba suite at this beautiful hotel. The moment you walk down the narrow walkway to the entrance of the property, you know you are in for something special and unique. The way the riad has grown over the years makes it quite an adventure to find your way around for the first day or two, but then everything starts to make sense. I highly recommend you visit the fitness area - if not to work out just to see the amazing architecture - it was my favorite part of the hotel. Also a treatment in the spa is a must-do, beautiful space with a relaxed atmosphere and caring and knowledgeable staff. Of course the restaurant is also incredible. It…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

This is by far, the BEST hotel we have ever stayed at and we are travelers! The staff is incredibly gracious, attentive, kind, and genuine. The front desk staff helped plan our trips and guides and everything has been simply beautiful. Today we did a traditional Haman and chose the Imperial spa package which was WONDERFUL.

 May 2019,1,Never visit,"This place is a luxurious dump. My family stayed here in May and we had about $1400 dollars stolen from our room. It was the greatest shame and in turn, the general manager blamed us and accused us of threatening him as well as said that we were trying to extort the hotel. The general manager, Taoufik Ghaffouli, is the most pathetic coward i’ve ever seen. He is surely going to read this review and respond with something condescending. He in fact contacted Trip Advisor and had them delete the posts which my family members had posted in which they described their experience at this s*** hole hotel. I will follow this post with a scanned copy of the police report that my family and I filed with the Moroccan Police as well as a video I captured of Taoufik Ghaffouli being his true…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2019,5,Amazing experience,"This luxury riad was absolutely fantastic. The service was excellent, the location is perfect, and the restaurant was ranked number two in Marrakech on Forbes magazine.

 June 2019,5,Amazing hotel! Don’t miss the cooking class,"This is a very unique quaint hotel in Marrakech. We had flown from Miami nonstop to Casablanca. Hotel assisted us with transportation and Yousef was great. A nice relaxing 2 hour 10 minute drive to the hotel. Train is also an option but generally runs late. We had preselected the Dalila room with a nice private balcony overlooking the tea courtyard. Room decor was beautiful and flower petals were all over. A nice fresh vase of roses was also in the room. Don’t miss the cooking class! We booked a 3 hour chicken tajine class where we learned the tajine and two traditional side dishes that we then enjoyed with our group. The class started with a tea making class, discussion on spices and then a quick tour of the local baker where everyone takes their bread daily to have baked. The…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2019,5,Quaint yet still luxurious,This hotel was very enjoyable to stay at. We stayed 2 nights went to different cities and came back again for the last day before our departure back home. The entrance is not by the road but by an alleyway. Upon entering your greeted with very professional and helpful staff. They helped us get cabs every time. And gave us champagne and treats in our room. The hotel and a quaint courtyard that offered afternoon tea. The hotel is also a restaurant that apparently was Winston Churchill’s favorite place. The whole place is definitely luxurious yet also traditional in decor and feel. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. My only one complaint is our first suite was next to a mosque which they had loud prayers at 5AM in the morning everyday. So if this bothers you consider asking to…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The place was clean and furnished with the top antique Moroccan decor and furniture. I felt like I was in a Moroccan house since it was fully built with Moroccan antiques. I can’t relive this experience with La Madison Arabe anywhere else.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,Fantastic and beautifully designed property with excellent service,"La Maison Arabe is a beautiful riad/hotel in the medina. The design will take your breath away - there are so many gorgeous, ornate details! The medina is a hectic, overwhelming place, but La Maison Arabe is a true oasis within it. The staff is truly fantastic and will go out of their way to make you feel at home. They are always friendly, always smiling, and always helpful. Three examples from our stay: 1) Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 9am. They offered us complimentary breakfast and had the room ready by the time we finished breakfast. 2) My husband's back was hurting but we were scheduled to do a cooking class so didn't have time to go to a pharmacy.

 March 2019,5,Beautiful oasis with genuine people,"It takes quite a lot for me to write a good review as it is quite rare in this day and age to feel so welcomed and taken care of. I have been fortunate enough to have stayed with some high end accommodation providers mainly throughout my job but La Maison Arabe has an unmatched level of hospitality, absolutely nothing is too much trouble for the manager Taoufik, Adil and the team. They are extremely attentive, anticipated our every need without being overbearing or intrusive. The riad-hotel itself is very well kept, I was traveling with my best friend and we both loved our room and found the bed and pillows heavenly. We both work in the interior design industry and there aren't enough words to describe the beautiful Moorish decors and architecture we encountered at this place. …",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,Fantastic restaurant,My family and I ate here during our recent stay in Marrakesh. We booked in advance and had a heat table by the pool for a late evening meal. The food is amazing and has a great choice of authentic or modern cuisine. We all opted for authentic and they were all superb. There is a great wine and drinks choice and overall the price is very reasonable for a high standard of restaurant. They also have menus with backlights which is a first fir me and saves getting your phone out at night to read it. The staff were fantastic and very helpful with food advice etc. Definitely one for your list when in Marrakesh.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The leather, carpets, colors, designs and much more were the best in the area; all drawn back to Morrocan culture. The food was amazing and my children loved it. I tried the spa and was pampered as if I was in 1000 and 1 nights. The employees were professional and I felt like that they cared about it as if it was their home.

The food on the property from the Moroccan restaurant and poolside breakfast was exceptional. We were able to take advantage of the shuttle bus to the off-site private garden and pool and were lucky to have the pool and garden to relax on our own.

Cooking class was fun!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,Exquisite Property,"We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel. Luxury is the word to describe the experience. We were led to the patio during check-in and the front-desk manager filled in all of our passport information. We were served virgin mojitos, which were the best we had in Morocco. Taken on a tour of the property and the extensive services they provide - hammam, pool, 3 restaurants, jazz bar and more. While on the property we ate the restaurant twice and had wonderful live music accompaniment. We also took advantage of the hammam services which were wonderful. While there, we also took cooking classes, which are highly recommended! A once in a lifetime experience at this property.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2019,5,A hotel others should model themselves on,"We took a 3 day trip from Dublin to Marrakech last week and were fortunate to have picked La Mason Arabe as our base for the weekend. This is a traditional riad at the edge of the central souks which has subtlety added some of life’s modern comforts with style and class - a gym, a spa and a modern Moroccan cookery school built into the original architecture of a facility which has expanded over the years. The breakfast was an amazing buffet of fresh fruits and, somewhat less healthy but absolutely delicious, local pastries (I’m guessing made in house). The egg station served omelettes and traditional Moroccan pancakes - the latter of which everyone needs to experience once in their lives. We ate in the international restaurant on our last night by the pool. There are two menus,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,What a fabulous hotel,"We used this hotel as a base when my friend and I went trekking in the High Atlas Mountains. We left our wives there for the days we were away. Anyway, this is a hotel full of character, with excellent facilities and staff that were exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble. The standard of accommodation is excellent as is the food and facilities. It is centrally located, so its easy to reach places of interest in the old city. I cannot recommend this establishment highly enough and would recommend La Maison Arabe to anyone visiting Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Nice room, nice staff, nice food. It’s authentic, although I prefer the large swimming pool and full gym, for a short stay, this is a nice place to stay. You walk in to the Souk within 5-10 minutes. Although to Djema en Fna can take up to 30 minutes",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2019,5,"Perfect Moroccan food, beautiful setting, witty and professional waiters","This review is for the restaurant. It offers a two-page menu, Moroccan on one side and Western cuisine on the other. My guests ordered from the Moroccan side and were delighted by the selection of Moroccan salads, the ""briouates"" (mini filo pastry savoury starters) to start with and the quality of the lamb and various tagines as main courses. I chose the Western rack of lamb and was equally pleased. The music/musicians really create a local atmosphere. The waiters were very attentive and balanced professionalism and comical impertinence to perfection. Excellent experience overall.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,Beautiful Riad,"I can understand why the ratings are so high for this riad - they are certainly justified.

 April 2019,5,Magical Marrakech,"La Maison Arabe is a gem in the beautiful city of Marrakech. To digress a little, for anyone who hasn't been to Marrakech and is considering going: go. After landing at the most beautiful airport I've ever seen (and I'm an architect), we wound our way in a cab through a surprisingly lush, clean, exotic city to the Maison Arabe. (Note: the hotel can arrange airport pick-up.) La Maison Arabe is centrally located near most of the main attractions and the souk, which is within a 10 minute walk. The hotel is authentic and charming and makes you feel right at home upon arrival. Guests almost don't need to leave the property, which offers two restaurants, a bar/jazz club, pool and a grotto-like hammam spa. The main restaurant is particularly beautiful due to its location…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2019,4,Charming but a little dated,"The staff at this Riad could not have been lovelier, the food was excellent and we had a very large room.

 April 2019,5,Excellent - again !,"This is the second time we have stayed here, which is pretty rare for us and it was as good, if not better, than last time. The manager Adil and his staff are brilliant and assist you all they can. We stayed 4 nights in a suite this time and it was great. Plenty of space and a courtyard to relax in. The bed was a tad hard but better that than soft. We were warmly welcomed into the Maison and had water and wine in the room on arrival along with rose petals. The really good thing about this place is that it’s moments from the action, the main square, shops and souks, but a world away inside. Afternoon tea is served daily with petit fours and they have a Moroccan chap playing a cross between a drum and a guitar quietly in the courtyard area of the hotel. The brand is…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2019,4,Wonderful Riad with a History,"This charming Riad was one of the first to be established in Marrakech for foreigners and is located inside the Medina. Winston Churchill was a visitor. It is a delightful maze of rooms, stairs and open courtyards accented by elaborate woodwork, tiles and trellises of bougainvillea and such.Our rooms ranged from large to cozy but all exceedingly comfortable, clean and updated - all opening up to a courtyard patio. Service was excellent and the piano bar was hopping in the evening. Just a lovely place close to the square. Much prefer this to the ""Vegas"" type hotels outside of the Medina. Be sure to visit the Hammam there - great experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

It’s enough to know it’s a 15 min walk for the central square of the Medina, the food at the restaurants is excellent, it’s quiet, and the service from the front desk to bottom is maid service is warm, friendly, professional. Everyone we spoke with was enjoying their stay. A special thank you to Morad at the front desk. He help us author a note of appreciation for our driver’s family for hosting us at their farm.

Breakfast outstanding,"I stayed at five luxury riads across Morroco in nine days and this was absolutely the best one. the service, the room , riad architecture absolutely great. Location highly accessible also , by the road and yet close to main square. some riads are deep in the medina which makes navigation and dragging your luggage there a bit harder. The breakfast here by far was the best amongst any other place, international and local selection with high quality ingredients. Usually would not stay at the same place twice, but I would stay here again in a heartbeat if I came back to Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

I thought the hospitality of the people who worked at La Maison was specifically superb. They were so accommodating and pleasant. And they were proactive in being helpful in every conceivable service. One particular time to note was they kept the hammam open later than usual to help us squeeze in last minute appts on our last night. The cleaning was impeccable and the towels and sheets (often over looked items in hospitality) were amazing. I was particularly sad to leave Morocco and La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

He did get sick for a night after we ate dinner at the hotel, but I think it was due to cumulative 10 days traveling and eating in Morocco.

 February 2019,5,Highly Recommend,"We really loved this hotel. It is worth it to spend the extra money to stay here over some of the less expensive hotels. The staff, service and attention to detail set it apart. Wish we could have stayed longer, but will definitely be back. Location: It’s in a great location in the medina but away from too much congestion. Everything we wanted to see was within walking distance. We were woken up by the morning prayers playing through the medina around 7am but it is part of the experience. The location felt safe and secure. Rooms: Clean; big, comfortable beds; heated floors in bathroom; huge shower; lovely Moroccan décor; good views of the garden area.

The bed was comfortable and large. The hotel location is excellent 15 minutes walk from Jemaa el-Fnaa and the souk. The staff is very attentive and helpful (one of the nice touches was that they completed our departure cards). Breakfast was also great, served in the large courtyard, by the pool. Will definitely stay La Maison again...",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Chez Vous at La Maison Arabe!! Honeymoon Trip,"La Maison Arabe is one of the most extraordinary hotels. The staff is exceptional. The hotel has a saying, you are at ""Chez Vous"" This is their culture and they do it well. Most organizations strive to get to this level of quality but are not consistent. Without exception, and in a very nonintrusive way, we were made to feel at home. Friendly, helpful, concerned, aware and just wonderful. My list is not inclusive, and when I say the entire staff, I really do mean that the staff was universally welcoming. Here are a few of the many who made us feel at home. I wish I could list all of them. Adil, Brahim, Rachida, Abdessamad, Fadwa, Marouane. The Riad is intimate. The rooms are incredibly comfortable and beautifully decorated, as is the entire hotel.

I opened the door to a sitting room, antechamber, bedroom and large porch looking into a private garden courtyard. All of the hotel staff were exceptional! The food was also very, very good.

 February 2019,5,Knock out service,"We stayed 3 nights here and loved it. It’s a tad quirky in feel but classy and the service from all the staff, at all times, and in every situation, was as charming and helpful as it could possibly be.

It is a really great place to stay. There is a terrace on the roof for reading (or a bottle wine), and a jazz bar with a mixologist who is talented and a lot of fun. Just tell him what liquor and flavors you like, and he will whip you up his own original. If you like gin try his invention ""The Sunflower."" Service is terrific, with the desk people very nice and helpful and wanting to ensure your stay is great. You are greeted with green tea in a nice room with birds singing.

 November 2018,5,Opulent. Beautiful. Mesmerizing.,"We stayed three nights in this excellent property and were greeted with drinks and rose petals on the bed. Service is impeccable. The restaurants and club are excellent, and breakfast by the pool includes made to order eggs. The hammam was the best my husband had ever been to. I took their cooking class and was treated to a half day of instruction and entertainment — and the management gave a a complimentary copy of their cookery book when we left.

The staff is truly outstanding, generous, professional and willing to do anything for their guests. The space itself is breathtakingly beautiful. I get the sense that every room is different but they are spacious, cozy and clean. I loved the balcony over the riad/pool. The breakfast included in the stay is probably the best breakfast I've had at any hotel. The location is also really central - less than 15 minute walk to the Medina. It was really a memorable experience and I would go back in a heartbeat.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2019,5,Dinner At La Maison Arabe for our final night in Marrakech,What a way to end our visit to Marrakech. The hotel is absolutely stunning with restaurant seating above a beautiful pool.

 January 2019,5,Wonderful stay,"We had a great stay in this beautiful hotel. Theirs was the best among all the breakfast buffets we had in Morocco. Their restaurant food too was amazing, which we found is the case in general through out Morocco. Their rooms were on the smaller side than what we are used to in US or Europe, and there was hardly room for us to walk inside the room with all our luggage. Not a big issue, but something to keep in mind. Bathroom was spotless and modern. Staff was friendly and helpful.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2018,5,Great service,"We stayed at La Maison Arabe with our daughters, and both rooms were lovely. There were outdoor seating areas for both rooms, and the riad is lovely.

Highly recommend this lodging in Marrakech!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2019,5,Tea in the courtyard,"We stopped off at Hotel Arabe for a drink when wandering round the streets. We were seated in the courtyard and had 2 mint teas served with pastries. It is a beautiful place. Having tea here feels very intimate. There is a man on cushions playing the Berber bass and singing very softly, what a beautiful sound! A young man at the opposite end is on hand with tea, which he prepares in a pot over a flame and then serves and refills your glass. Would happily recommend this place for tea and can only imagine it is a fantastic place to stay. Hotel manager was polite, friendly and helpful too. Thanks!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2018,5,Truly fantastic hotel in Marrakesh,"We recently spent 4 nights at La Maison Arabe and it was the highlight of our trip to Morocco. It has a fantastic location right near all of the action in the medina, yet is set in a quiet alleyway away from traffic and congestion. The food at the two restaurants is absolutely outstanding - world class, and in a lovely, relaxing setting. The rooms are beautiful and uniquely designed; the common rooms are cozy and elegant (we spent a lot of time just playing games/cards in one of the lounges); the amenities are great (we had a great experience at the hammam/spa), the outdoor pool area and ""solarium"" are wonderful, and the staff are tremendously friendly and helpful.

 January 2019,5,Paradise in Marrakech,"I started my trip in Morocco at the Riad, Hotel and Spa La Maison Arabe. In advance of my trip, the staff was incredibly helpful arranging transportation, cooking classes and recommendations about Marrakech. I was blown away with the 5 star customer service, the beauty of the grounds and the warm welcome I received. Upon arrival we were provided a welcome refreshment and historical tour en route to the room. Throughout my stay, the team were incredibly gracious hosts and always ensured you were well looked after. I booked in a hammam during my stay. It was so fantastic that I booked a second treatment the following week when I intended to come back through the city. I also referred some friends on the trip to both their cooking class and hammam.

Our first stay at the Riad was so excellent we decided we had to come back! We spent New Years Eve at the Riad for 2019 and had an excellent time. We purchased a table for dinner that evening and were entertained through the night be music, dancers, a few surprises and of course an excellent meal! It was an NYE to remember! This Riad is a historic one in Marrakech and is actually the first Riad in the City. They started with the most famous restaurant in the city and over time grew to the Riad they are today.

Both were beautiful with garden views. -Restaurants/bar: great food in the Moroccan and the international restaurants.

 November 2018,5,Gorgeous property walking distance to medina,"This hotel is top notch. From the staff, to the decor, to the food, everything was wonderful. We ate dinner at the international restaurant because it was so good. White glove service. A little more diverse menu with some international options, but also had a delicious meal at the hotel restaurant with local fare. Breakfast buffet is delicious. Jazz bar with live piano music and cocktails was really nice. The hotel is maintained immaculately. We also took advantage of the off-site pool, which was about 20 minute shuttle ride and worth the trip. Food and beverage available at the pool. The hotel and restaurants are on the pricey side for Morocco, but still less than what you would pay for equivalent quality in the US.

 January 2019,5,Loved this place,"We stayed 5 nights at this gorgeous reprieve in the middle of the chaotic Medina. It was so nice returning back here each day after our adventures. The location is excellent for touring the old Medina and can easily walk or taxi to new town. The room we had was spacious and lovely. Please keep in mind that it is an old building so don't expect new and modern. I do think their bathrooms could use a cosmetic upgrade. The service here was 5 star. They were friendly, very attentive and booked whatever we requested. The breakfasts were plentiful and delicious. We did a cooking class at their cooking school one day and it was fabulous.

 January 2019,5,Fantastic,"We had a great stay in this beautiful Riad.

 November 2018,5,Perfection in a hotel,The rooms are amazing. I had a fabulous suite that I didn't want to leave and the bathrooms divine.

 November 2018,5,This place is amazing!,"This is a small hotel that is a converted Casbah. Our suite was a beautiful three room setup surrounding a private open space. La Maison Arabe serves some of the finest food in the city in a gorgeous dining room. I cannot say enough about the service of the staff. They were always there to answer questions provide anything I needed, or make suggestions. You truly have to see this place to believe it. The experience is better than any of the top hotels we visited in the city. Be aware that there are no elevators. Since it is an updated Casbah there are many stairs as one moves about.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2019,5,I spent three days of PERFECTION at La Maison Arabe!,"This boutique hotel is unbelievable! Everything is so beautiful and well thought out. And the food is exquisite.

 December 2018,5,Don't even consider staying anywhere else,"I was extremely disappointed when I found out La Mamounia was booked and that we wouldn't be able to stay there, after hearing so much about its storied history. In the category of ""everything happens for a reason""... after staying at La Maison Arabe, I could not be more thankful that La Mamounia couldn't accommodate us. La Maison made our entire trip to Marrakech. I will never forget this hotel starting with the mint tea and housemate pastries in a beautiful, candlelit courtyard upon our arrival even though it was midnight. Incredible staff and service; amazing food; stunning interior design and an intimate, warm environment that made you feel you belonged. As a side note, we went to La Mamounia for drinks and could not have been less impressed -- impersonal, generic…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2019,5,Boutique in all the best ways with terrific food,"If you like small, luxury hotels with a dash of eccentricity, this is the one for you. It's very expensive, especially the food, but it really is worth it. The food is astonishing - both in its price and its quality. The taste is sublime. Breakfast is a tableau of astonishing flavours that needs a full morning to explore. Even the location is perfect: a ten minute walk from the busy old town, tucked away down a tranquil footpath. Our room, a junior suite, was spacious, stylish and comfortable.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2018,5,Amazing hotel and impeccable service.,The staff and the location are perfect. Everything about this hotel was perfect.

 December 2018,5,We loved this hotel!,"We have zero complaints about our experience at La Madison Arabe. From the minute we walked in until the minute we left, we felt the warmth of everyone who works there. The staff is helpful and friendly. The room was clean and beautiful with the most comfy bed and softest sheets and towels. The food at the restaurants were 5-stars. I wish I could have stayed longer.

 December 2018,5,Stop searching and book this hotel now!,"Truly impressed by this hotel, and that's rare because I am a hotel snob! The beauty of a traditional riad with the amenities of a 5-star hotel. Service was comparable to a Four Seasons - from the Front Desk attendants to the restaurant waiters to the housekeepers. Very accommodating: Last minute dinner reservation - ""sure!"" Need to move your hammam appointment an hour: ""no problem!"" Need a bellboy to run to the train station to buy you train tickets - ""happy to do it!"" They catered to everything we asked for. Location is also excellent, as we could walk to most major tourist sites, and when we took cabs, they were no more than $5.

 December 2018,5,The restaurant was fabulous!,"We were recommended this Riad, Le Maison Arabe, by others staying in our Riad. The Property itself is stunning.

 December 2018,5,Charming Riad — Amazing Service,"We stayed at the Maison Arabe for four nights. Upon arrival the staff was so welcoming — they took our luggage, seated us in a beautiful open space, served us refreshments while they dealt with all the paperwork. It is a nice touch not to be standing at the front desk waiting. The Riad feels like a maze but every corner has its own charm and feel. The carpets, the art, the walls, etc. Even fireplaces. Fresh flowers everywhere including the rooms. Afternoon tea every day. Heated pool even in December (although it is still very fresh in the shade). The two restaurants are excellent, and sitting at the Arab House is enjoyable in and of itself. Cannot stress enough how beautiful and charming the riad feels.

 December 2018,3,Nice hotel,I am honestly not sure where all the rave reviews are coming from. I booked the hotel based on the reviews so perhaps my expectations were too high. The facilities are tired and need an upgrade and i am not sure how this hotel qualifies for 5*. The service is adequate but again neither exceptional nor in line with an actual 5* hotel. It’s charming but not amazing at least by international standards.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Marrakech,"I have had the great good fortune to travel to many countries and stay in dozens of lovely hotels but La Maison Arabe may be my favorite EVER! It is truly unique and special. It is spectacularly beautiful and the staff could not be nicer, friendlier or more helpful. They are super professional and efficient. This is a place you don’t want to leave, even for dinner, which is why having two gorgeous restaurants with wonderful food and music on premises is an added bonus. Add in the spa and jazz bar and I could stay forever! A truly magical experience. I did not have enough time to take a cooking class but I was able to view the spaces and that looks like another good reason to return!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2018,5,"6 stars! The Staff, the Room, the Food, the Service",We stayed here and two other places around Morocco. This was by far our favorite. Our room was spacious and carefully designed. The staff did literally everything to make our stay in the country more comfortable (even keeping a piece of luggage while we traveled to other places and offering mint tea and cookies when we weren’t even guests anymore). The cooking class was great—large TV screens at each cooking terminal so you could easily view the instructors. And delicious chicken pastilla and cappuccinos. This is where you must stay!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2018,5,Secret Jem,"We passed by this wonderful Riad, and stopped for lunch, I think it was the best e had in Marrakech, a little pricey but worth it.

We highly recomment it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2018,5,Extrodinary Cooking Class,"I have taken many cooking classes, and this is in my top 3 in the world! The facility is modern and comfortable. Each person has their own station and cooks their own food. Staff is friendly, helpful and quick paced with humor. It was a 1/2 day of learning, fun and good food. If you like to cook -- don't miss this! (and they have a fantastic gift shop!)",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,4,Excellent but....,A lovely oasis in the midst of the chaos of Marrakech. Entering into the calm Riad with scented candles and fires lit you enter a different world. Rooms spacious and comfortable; one small niggle - to be charged for coffee capsules in the coffee machine seems petty in rooms of this quality. Breakfast good but service a bit mixed. Service at reception extremely helpful. A word of warning- you will be woken early by the nearby mosque!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 November 2018,5,The Perfect Place for the last leg of our journey around Morocco,"We stayed in a junior suite which was spacious and well thought out. We could hear Moroccan music every evening and birds chirping every morning when we left the doors to the patio open which was lovely. When we shut the doors, the room was silent for those who need quiet to sleep. The room amenities were plentiful (soaps, shampoos, conditioners, towels) as were the hotel amenities (multiple restaurants, a pool, the spa, afternoon tea, and delicious Moroccan and/or International cuisine) The location was wonderful - an easy walk to many historical buildings, the square and souks (and the ATM) - and we never felt unsafe. Quite the contrary, people seemed to go out of their way to be helpful - especially when navigating some of the twisty walkways through the souks. Best of…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Fantastic Visit,The best in class tone was set upon arrival. We were greeted with Mint Tea and pampered in the Jazz bar while our room was prepped. All the rooms are unique and well appointed. Both restaurants were excellent and service was great. They provided us with a very knowledgeable guide to take us around town and shopping- which I strongly suggest. I highly recommend this property.

From the minute we were met on the curb to our hotel provided car to the airport, they could not do enough to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The restaurants at Maison Arabe are the best in the city, especially for Moroccan cuisine, and the courtyard restaurant is quite beautiful. They have a fabulous cooking school which was very fun, high tech, organized and charming. Location is excellent . 2 blocks from government run fair trade market where local artisans are at work and price tags give visitors valuable information ( especially before going to the Souk).

 November 2018,5,Authentic Lodging in the Medina,"I was initially uncertain whether I made the correct choice because photos on the website can be misleading. Shortly after we arrived, it became clear we did make the right choice. The property is gorgeous and the staff always goes the Extra mile to accommodate. The breakfast buffet was the bomb with many selections. Our party was sick with colds and upon arrival, they sent staff to the pharmacy for cold medicine. I particularly enjoyed the jazz piano in the Jazz Bar too. The only caveat is there are a number of satires. Throughout the property which made it challenging for one person in our party. Otherwise it was greatly needed exercise. Highly recommend this property if you want to be close to the action in the Medina and numerous vendors in the Berber Market.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,The best experience in all of Marrakech!,"Our stay at La Maison Arabe was truly a highlight of our time in Morocco. The entire property is beautifully decorated and maintained. I was fortunate enough to stay in 3 different rooms/suites - each unique, stunningly gorgeous and welcomed with rose petals, delicious local pastry treats, water and wine, to enjoyed on the private terrace or perhaps while soaking in a luxurious bath. Above all - the staff was thoughtful and helpful in every way. While preparing for our vacation, Mostafa was quick to respond to our emails making the planning quick and easy. Once there, Adil was a super star resource to us during throughout our stay. Everyone on staff helped to arrange airport transport, car rental, offer great recommendations for dining and Atlas mountain excursions, and overall…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Fantastic Place to Stay in Marrakech,"We stayed at La Maison Arabe two nights, but would have loved to stay longer. The hotel is stunning, and the staff is very friendly, attentive, and accommodating. They provided every amenity imaginable. All our meals were fabulous, and my visit to the spa with the traditional hammam was unforgettable.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Amazing Riad and service!,"We only stayed two nights but they were a magical two nights. The property is just amazing - from fresh flowers to fires going in the fireplaces. We experienced the spa, cooking class and their restaurants - and really can’t find any flaws. It was a wonderful experience and the staff were really what made the experience. So welcoming, helpful and nice with every interaction we had with anyone there. It’s a quick walk to the Medina and really is a perfect place to stay. The weather was a bit cooler so didn’t get to enjoy the pool but will do so next time we come back! Could go on for hours as it was so great!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Incredible food and atmosphere,"How perfect is La Maison Arabe? We had dinner here our first night and were blown away. Starting with drinks in the courtyard and then the jazz bar, and then on to dinner (the world's greatest Moroccan salads then tagine for me and pigeon for him) and dessert (ginger creme brulee!), everything was perfect. The service was on point and we can't wait to go back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Jewel in the Moroccan crown!,"This hidden gem in Marrakech is the most beautiful oasis. Staff are incredibly friendly, helpful and truly go out of their way to ensure your stay is memorable. the hotel has a long history worth exploring! The spa is a “MUST”!! Absolutely beautiful serene setting, with authentic decor - it’s truly suburb! Opt for a traditional hamman (steam bath) & massage to unwind and treat yourself. Two quality restaurants offer both traditional Moroccan & international cuisine have a great reputation and always heavily booked by both in-house guests and other visitors to the city. Afternoon tea on the house & jazz bar post dinner are also a treat! Would definitely stay here again without question!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Wonderful haven of tranquility with fantastic service,"We had a wonderful week here, this really is a very special place. It's tucked away down an alley (Derb) so we were glad we got the airport transfer offered. It's located away from the busiest parts of the media so was very tranquil, but only a 10 minute walk down to the Jeema el-Fna Square. We were given a lovely refreshing welcome drink on arrival and a tour of the facilities. Our suite was amazing, it had a huge bed with a stunning domed ceiling, comfy sitting area and a lovely enclosed terrace. It was very clean, comfortable and well appointed. The desk staff were brilliant, very helpful with all enquiries, nothing was too much trouble for them. We ate in the restaurants here some nights and had wonderful meals in both, again, with great service. We will definitely stay…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2018,4,Amazing 2nd stay!,"We came with our family 2 years ago, and returned with a group of friends. Loved this hotel/riad hotel. The feeling is superb because you have the close ambience of a riad, but with the service of a 5 star hotel. Is a must the spa and the restaurant too! We were upgraded upon arrival on 2 out of the 4 rooms that we booked (they gave us the same triplex room than in our last visit!). We will come back again!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,"Amazing, authentic Moroccan cooking class",My boyfriend and I had a lovely cooking class on how to make a chicken tagine. We accidentally booked the class for the wrong date and the staff were very nice and accommodating and arranged for us to have a private cooking class so we didn’t miss out. The chef was very helpful and we had some mint tea as part of the class which was a nice touch. And to top it off we were both given a tagine and recipe at the end of the class so we can make it again at home. I would throughly recommend!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Outstanding hotel,"This is the best hotel my husband and I have ever stayed in. It is beautiful, and tastefully designed and decorated. The food is outstanding and service is top notch. We could not recommend more highly.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,A beautiful Riad within the Old City Walls near the Souk,"We stay in La Maison Arabe in Marrakech in early November 2018. To get to the riad you follow a passageway, to narrow for cars, from a main street for a 1/2 block or so to a nice looking entryway. The original riad which I believe had 10 rooms was expanded through the purchase of an adjacent building and a major remodel. As a result the floor plan is a little confusing but quite nice once you figure out how to get around. Everything looks into a open central area where there is a relatively large attractive pool. There is a casual dining room on one side and outside tables surrounding the pool where breakfast, lunch and casual dinner are served. On some evening there is pleasant live music played at the end of the pool during dinner. There is also a formal dining room…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Amazing! One of the best hotels ever!,"This hotel has everything of a 5 star hotel and with the feeling of staying at an arabic sultan. First of all the interior, the building, architecture and decorations are like taken from Thousand and one nights story. Everywhere you look there are new details and beautiful things. The staff are all amazing. So caring and wonderful and really keen on taking care of every guest in a personal way. The food in the restaurant by the pool was wonderful. Both the moroccan menu and the international were both delicious. The breakfast was a fantastic break for us from all the bread we have been eating since the buffet also had many vegetarian options, sallads and anything you could want. The hammam was wonderful. We are regular travelers all over the world and we have stayed in many…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The rooms are perfect with fine linens huge bathrooms and ample closet space. The dining rooms serve perfectly prepared meals both Moroccan and European. Don’t miss the Hammam. You will feel so pampered. Splurge on the hour long massage. The well stocked bar has a pianist in the evenings. The cooking class is a must and the gift shop is amazing. The concierge will help you with anything you need from reservations to directions. This is one special place.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,A very warm welcome,"Stayed here for 4 nights, and what a treat is it. Like a little oasis in the hustle bustle of the medina. The building is fabulous, we booked very late, so they only had one room type available which was the smallest room type, but even this room was spacious as far better than we expected. However, I think it’s the staff that make this hotel special. Nothing is too much trouble and you will feel like a family member as soon as you arrive. The service will rival any top hotel, and so much better than some faceless chain hotel. The location is very good, and you can walk to most tourist attractions, but taxis are cheap, and the hotel will happily arrange for you. They also arranged tickets for museums which allowed us to queue jump, and the queues were huge! The food in the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Perfect Choice for 4 nights,"This was one of our favorite hotels during our entire trip. The hotel furnishings are of the highest quality. We stayed in a junior suite and all rooms were designed differently. Room was very well designed and immaculate. There was an unbelievable amount of drawer and wardrobe space, an abundance of bright lights, nice size bathroom, remote air, and blackout curtains. We found the overall vibe of the hotel to be warm and homey and at the same time very classy. The staff was on top of every detail and were always friendly. Tea is a nice touch every afternoon as the area was very relaxing to sit in. Breakfast was included each morning with an omelet station off to the corner. This is the perfect location as it affords easy access to car pickup. Book your rooms before the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Superb Riad,"Just returned from a great stay at La Maison Arabe. The hotel is well appointed and the staff are all very helpful. I attended the cooking class at the hotel which was very good value and I would highly recommend. Both restaurants were very good, however a bit more variety in the menus wouldn’t go amiss. The hotel arranged for a driver to take us to the Atlas Mountains for the day - which are well worth the visit - and again was good value.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Don't let the back-alley entrance fool you,"The approach may seem unglamorous, but inside LMA is great. Very ""Moroccan"" and yet still very much in keeping with Western/U.S. standards. High-end lux feel to all the rooms and common areas. Try the cookies.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Probably the best luxury boutique riad in Marrakech,"We spent two nights in La Maison Arabe in Marrakech. Everything was PERFECT from start to finish. The hotel has all the amenities one can wish for but at the same type is a very typical riad with all the charming characteristics of such places. The decoration is absolutely gorgeous and full of typical handcrafted pieces made in Marocco. Above all, absolutely everyone working there has a happy face, is friendly and very helpful. I would recommend this places everyday to everyone. LAst but not least the hammam (Spa) is second to none.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Like a fairytale,"We stayed at “La Maison Arabe” for three night and it’s one of the best hotel experiences I’ve ever had. This place is just magic. The whole interiour setting is so unique and typical for Marocco. The rooms have windows to several small partios with fountains and trees where birds are singing. We stayed in two different rooms each of them offering the best comfort you can wish for. The service at La Maison Arabe is amazing, the whole staff is doing it’s best to make your time in Marrakech special. The front desk was always willing to help us on any questions. (The sell e.g. tickets for Le Jardin Majorelle which saved us from standing in line for a long time). I can also highly recommend to visit the Hammam and enjoy a treatment. I did that twice and it was really worth it. …",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Perfect stay at La Maison Arabe in Marrakech,"We found the hotel perfect in every regard: ambiance, food, service, comfort, decor, location.

I cant imagine a better place.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Beautiful Small Hotel,"La Madison Arabe is located on the edge of the Medina in Marrakech. It is a conglomeration of six old houses, so quite a rabbit warren of stairs and passageways and courtyards. The rooms are small but very attractive and partly furnished with Moroccan antiques. The staff is incredibly helpful and eager to please. There are two restaurants: a Moroccan one and a continental and Moroccan one situated around the swimming pool. The food is excellent. The cooking course offered by this hotel is wonderful and most professionally equipped.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The rooms were well appointed, very clean and serviced promptly twice daily right after we returned the room keys to the front desk when we left the hotel. The A/C worked extremely well and was operated via remote control from anywhere in the room which was very convenient. The location was very convenient and I would highly recommend La Maison Arabe as it was the best hotel we stayed at while in Morocco, including Dar Ahlam!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,a must visit while in Marrakech,"Even if you can't stay here, you must visit. I highly recommend dinner poolside and the cooking class. The architectural details and the decor is stunning. I read on here to visit the jazz bar prior to dinner- so glad we did! The food was outstanding- but the service was the best hands down of any place we've dined in Morocco. We were relieved to have a variety of dishes that weren't Moroccan (after 2 weeks we needed a tagine break). The cooking class was awesome- you have little screens at each workstation so you can watch the instructor. One note- the class isn't part of the main hotel, it's just down the street where the boutique is located.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Fantastic service,"Every minute spent at this hotel has been above and beyond my expectations. A special mention to Adil on reception/ the manager, he really listened to every request we had and arranged our days including taxis, restaurants and a trip to Atlas Mountains. The hotel restaurant itself is out of this world, and I would recommend the hammam and massages.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,La Maison Arabe - what a beautiful place to end my stay in Morocco!,"As I walked through the door or this beautiful riad I was overwhelmed by the elegance and tasteful decor. Everywhere you looked there was something to take your breath away! It was beautiful enough that after settling in I walked around to take pictures so I wouldn't forget. We were then met by the thoughtful gesture of treats in our room and after our long bus ride, it was more than welcomed. Breakfast the next morning was a wonderful way to start the day, especially when you sat around the small pool and listened to all the birds flying around. But even better than all of that were the employees who in their quiet and gentle way couldn't do enough to make our stay one of the best I have every had and has left a lasting impression of Morocco for me. Staff at the Front…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Beautiful place and great food,"We ended up going twice to this place. It was great to dine in the garden next to the pool.

The Riad is also beautiful with a bit of history behind it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Beautiful riad.,"We have just returned from a rather wet few days in Marrakech. We couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay. La Maison Arabe feels special as soon as you enter. We began to unwind straight away with our complimentary drink in the tranquil courtyard. The decor is impeccable and Moroccan. We visited one of the larger 5* hotels whilst we were away and were so glad we had chosen La Maison as it feels so genuine and personal. The pool is warm and I wish I had found time for s dip there, but we did spend a long time at the garden pool which is a short complimentary drive away. We had a lovely poolside lunch in another peaceful setting. You must visit the hammam at the riad and I strongly advise having a massage after. It was bliss. Enjoy your trip.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Exceptional stay at the maison arabe !!!!,Can’t say enough about the exceptional service at this wonderful hotel that is centrally located at the heart beat of the city.

The suite overlooked the beautiful pool and in the pm you could here the soothing music from the talented musicians playing at the pool for dinner . My husband enjoyed the cooking workshop and I thoroughly was in bliss after the hamam and facial.

It has bags of charm, and an authentic beautiful with its carved wood walls and ornate tiles. Our room was very nice, with a small garden terrace. The restaurant (Le Trois Saveurs) was stunning, located around the beautiful courtyard pool, with live music both night we ate there. The food was also delicious, the menu is split into Moroccan and international dishes and each seemed to be of a high quality if the four meals my wife and I chose were any indication. The service in general was also excellent on the whole, both in initial email correspondence and the excellent front desk staff who were very efficient and attentive.

The hotel itself is a beautiful riad setting in the medina: a quiet and calm respite from the rush and bustle outside. Afternoon mint tea with music is included. Two restaurants, both with music. A swimming pool plus a Kasbah complete with a pool about 15 minutes away by complimentary transport. On checking out, we were given pastries and water for the journey and Moroccan Cookery Book based on hotel recipes, which is beautifully photographed.

 October 2018,5,An enclave of calm in the Medina,"Tranquility prevails amidst the chaos of Marrakesh, with lovely local ambiance, solicitous service and an over-the-top breakfast buffet. Multiple courtyards and apparently attached buildings do necessitate many stairs to get from one part of the riad to another. Dinner at their traditional restaurant was a great first meal in the country, and we thoroughly enjoyed their cooking school experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Excellent hotel with a Marokkan feel,"We spent two nights at this amazing Riad. It gives you a feeling of luxury, but not in a flashy way, it has more of that authentic, homey feeling. The building it self is absolutely beautiful, decorated so you get the impression of actually begin in Marokko, with lovely, local art everywhere. The staff was super friendly and can give you good advise about most things, which you might need in Marrakech. We had both breakfast and dinner there, I think maybe the best food experience we had on our trip, and also the hammam is relaxing in a beautiful spa department downstairs. We even came back for lunch after traveling in Marokko, and they helped us out with printing tickets and everything else we needed.

 September 2018,5,Cookery school at La Maison Arabe,"We had a wonderful afternoon at the cookery school and a lovely meal afterwards. The kitchen was extremely well appointed with screens to follow and plenty of staff to make sure that you were doing the right thing.

We were given recipe cards to take away and, as I forgot a couple of things, when I emailed Mohammed he sent me notes and more recipes. Excellent follow up service!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2018,5,Wonderful food and service - must visit!!,"We came here on the recommendation of our hotel manager and we were not disappointed. The restaurant is small but with a lovely ambience that was augmented by a live jazz duo who played well and just at the right volume. The food was sensational. We went all out and ordered pigeon pastilla, courgette soup, chicken tagine, tajiya and finished with a meringue. All of it was simply wonderful. Delicious, piping hot (where it should be) and well seasoned. The service was attentive and pleasant. All in all, a wonderful experience! A must-visit for Marrakech!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

We walked in on a Friday night without any reservation and got a really nice table by the musicians (they had live music on). Service was absolutely amazing from the person who greets you at the door to your waiter for the night. Delicious food, wine, music. Order meze platter (6-8 small plates; hummus, baba ganoush, roasted red peppers, etc served with fresh pitta bread) And definetely try one of the tagines. Wine Medallion is also very tasty if you fancy white.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2018,4,Great location-wonderful staff,We had 2 rooms and stayed 3 nights. We were close to the Medina to walk to restaurants.

Very convenient.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2018,5,A truly special 5 nights...,"This small and intimate hotel really does live up to the reviews. From the moment we arrived, to the ungodly 4:30am time we left, we could not have asked for more. Several things stand out for me: 1. First and foremost, the staff. The hotel has only 26 rooms, and consequently the staff really do know you during your stay. Nothing is too much trouble for them, from finding me some new shoe laces, to arranging for a new pair of trousers to be shortened at an incredibly reasonable cost. Everything is delivered in an understated, yet professional and warm manner. 2. The cookery school. As a total non cook, I did the 3 hour course with my wife, and it was great fun.

 September 2018,5,Amazing Experience,I am very picky with hotels mostly because I like a clean bathroom. We booked this hotel last minute on a spur of the moment overnight trip to Marrakech. Once we arrived we were treated exceptionally well. The traditionally decorated rooms were beautiful and bathroom was immaculate. We got an upgraded room which was so kind of them. It’s the attention to details like quick service and welcome drinks and pastries and luxurious accommodations with spa robes etc that make this one of the best places I’ve ever stayed (definitely top5). Location was convenient to the local sites. The cooking class was a lot of fun and our food was delicious. We most definitely will go back and I highly recommend this hotel as you won’t be disappointed.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2018,5,Beautiful Riad in convenient location,"We stayed in a number of Riads during our 12 day trip to Morocco. This was our favorite. Service was excellent and the decor very interesting. Lots of different small public areas. We stayed in room 219for two nights and liked the room. We ended up staying an extra night and had to move to room 215 and liked it even more. Had its own private outdoor sitting area and cool headboard and mosaics on the ceiling. I used the Hamman services and the pool located at their country club located 15 minutes away via free shuttle service. Very relaxing. Overall loved it.,",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 August 2018,5,The best hotel in the world,"We're experienced travellers and have stayed in many hotels all over the world. My husband rates La Maison Arabe the best hotel in the world and for this reason we have stayed here in August for 5 years in a row. August isn't the best time in Marrakech as it's so hot, but it's low season and therefore a bit cheaper. The country club (free shuttle every hour) with a beautiful garden and pool is the place to retreat to when the temperatures are really high. Otherwise, take a trip to the Atlas mountains which are close by. What makes La Maison Arabe so special are the Moroccan staff who really go out of their way to help you. They are friendly and efficient without being embarrassingly servile and obsequious. Each year, we see the same friendly faces, which must mean that…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2018,4,Nice hotel,"Lovely but not exceptional as it was. We had already been there a couple of times and even if it is always very nice, we did not find it superb as it was in the past. Breakfast is not excellent and unique, it is just good. They used to serve their amazing biscuits with mint tea free of charge in the past and we did not have them this time, which is a pity.. but rooms are always nice and clean and location is exceptional. And we did not try the spa treatments this time but in the past they were fantastic. So overall i would recommend it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2018,5,Must stay here,"What a delightful stay. Our Junior Suite was superb and the service was excellent. They have a lovely restaurant which had the best food in town and one of the finest spas I have ever enjoyed. I encourage everyone to have a Hamma Scrub which was the best I have every had!! We also took the cooking class was a superb treat. It is set up beautifully for groups and the chef was a pure delight. The front desk arranged tours which exceeded our expectations. They have a small pool on property and a country club and garden with a large pool 16 minutes away. If i saw any area of opportunity it would be to give guest complimentary coffee in the room, they have it but for a fee. Also at the cooking school we enjoyed wine while we cooking but later were charged. We would have still enjoyed…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,"Moroccan style, but the taste is one of the European best hotels.","The experience staying at La Maison Arab was more than expected. The hotel inside is Moroccan style, but we felt we were in Europe. The room is clean and the facilities are vey good level. Every staff was very kind so that the stay was so comfortable. The Hamman is clean and providing good service. The restaurant offers the high standard international food, which helped us suffering continued the Moroccan foods.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,"nice patio, good location and friendly staff",When we arrived at the hotel we got a welcome drink and a tour through the whole building. It is a really beautiful accommodation and through the windows of our rooms we were able to see the pool - it was very quiet! Breakfast was okay and dinner was exceptional! The atmosphere fits perfectly to a nice holiday.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,World class Riad in the heart of Marrakech,"This fabulous property is world class by any description, with a welcoming staff, wonderful restaurant, lovely spa, beautiful rooms and exemplary service. I will definitely stay there again when in Marrakech!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,"Lovely people, beautiful property, delightful stay,","What a fantastic holiday we had while staying at La Maison Arabe. Although I could go on about how lovely our room was (it was gorgeous), and how fantastic the food was (I ate everything, and then some), the most of note was how welcoming, knowledgeable and appreciative the staff were. Marrakech is a city that overloads your senses and so transforming that go-go-go into an immediate feeling of home was, in my opinion, their greatest triumph. In addition to the usual greetings, and smiles, the concierge made a conscious effort to help in all aspects. They scheduled several day-of activities, all of which turned out better than we could have imagined, including a cooking class (which I would strongly recommend), a camel ride outside of town, and a guide which toured us through…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,Lovely little place,"Experience was great from start to finish. A place I would recommend visiting, the seating outside by the small pool is a perfect setting for a chilled romantic meal. The staff were very attentive and helpful and the food was outstanding. I would recommend the duck risotto and chicken tagine. Not to pricey and even provide you with a couple of free pastries to round off the meal nicely.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,The only place to stay in Marrakech,"After being on the road and in the Sahara for 4 days, we were exhausted and filthy. What an absolute delight to return to Marrakech after the Sahara to La Maison Arabe where we were looked after so well and felt like we were coming home to our own little palace. Raja (not sure about the spelling?) was absolutely amazing at the front desk. It was like she never slept - she was always there to answer any questions that we had, help us out in any and every way that she could and was so friendly and welcoming that we felt at ease with her at once. The property is absolutely stunning and even though it's one of the ""larger"" riads, it didn't feel crowded at all. I would highly recommend the hammam in La Maison Arabe - it was the absolute perfect fix after our long travel into the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,A piece of paradise ... !,This hotel is one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed ( and I travel a lot !). It is calm and serene and the decor is exquisite !

 August 2018,5,Marrakech with the girls in August,"If you’re looking for authentic Marrakech, old world but chic, La Maison Arabe hits the nail on the head. It reminds of Blake’s in London. Standing out are the attention to detail in all elements of the decor and the gracious service. Nothing’s too much to ask, and all is provided in timely fashion. Mourad, at Reception, is wonderful. Hope to return.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2018,5,Stunning Hotel with authentic Moroccan Experience,"Being travel agents we travel a lot and must say that La Maison Arabe is one of the finest 5 star hotels we have stayed at. It is the type of magical property that has not overlooked a single detail. The service, while outstanding, was still down to earth and friendly , being a guest here was a truly magical experience . It has charm, old-school elegance and history you won’t get in the city’s flashy palace hotels . We were made to feel welcome from the moment we stepped through the door and until the moment we left. Nothing was too much trouble, everyone was very friendly. The food in the restaurant was wonderful, the meals we had were excellent and every breakfast time was most enjoyable, with very personal attentive service and staff - without being too obtrusive or…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The staff is always available to help you with everything and special thanks to the cooking class team and spa team. Looking forward to come back in winter to enjoy the warm living rooms !!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,Hotel La Maison Arabe,"After driving through the Atlas Mountains in extreme heat, this was a total haven. Set within the Médina it was cool, welcoming and a relief. Our meal last night was well cooked international food. Moroccan was available too but we needed a break from tagines and olives. This hotel is listed as a 5 star and we had a junior suite which was most luxurious. Breakfast was international. The bread was real French bread along with exquisite pastries. I would recommend this hotel highly.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,Perfect Gem,"This hotel offered everything I want from a truly good hotel, it is now on my short list of world-wide favourites, and I very much hope to return. It is well-located in a slightly calmer part of the Medina, with a genuine local feel and ""real people"" going about their daily lives in Marrakesh. As well as its own, you can walk to some top-notch restaurants if you want to go your own way. The interior is beautiful but not flashy, putting old-time good taste above ostentation. Above all, the unpretentious and friendly service was exceptional. If you want to treat yourself to a somewhat more expensive hotel, and feel really welcome, then forget the newer, bigger, or out-of-town places, this is definitely the one. There were too many nice touches to list here... to keep it short I'd…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,Stunning Riad with authentic Moroccan Experience,The Riad is a temple of authentic design and most amazing hospitality. You will feel walking trough a fairy tale. Every room is so tastefully and wonderful decorated. All areas in the hotel are places to sit to relax and enjoy the Moroccan lifestyle. A wonderful pool invites you for a swim and a amazing Spa is the perfect place for a treatment or Hamam. The stuff here has only one goal to make you the best and incredible time. Smiling faces when ever you meet them in the hall way and most dedicated to there job it is a pleasure to watch them during there work. All service here is outstanding!!! Do not forget to visit the Jazz Bar - where the bar chef is ready to serve most best mixed delights.

 April 2018,5,Ecellent dinner in beautiful setting,"Just a dinner here. The menu is extensive and inventive, a choice of international and authentic Moroccan. We mixed our choices and all were excellent. The service also was attentive. The setting in the courtyard next to the pool was perfect.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2018,5,"Great service, great food, great location, great hotel!","We stayed three nights at La Maison Arabe. We had a lovely, relaxed welcome and a very easy check in before having a “grand” tour of the hotel. We stayed in suite 222 which was so spacious if felt like we had our own floor! We had dinner at the hotel two of the three nights we were there - to be honest I wish we had eaten there for all three as the food was outstanding and the setting by the pool was just perfect. The hotel is perfectly located for the Souks (just 5 mins walk) and if you know where you’re going (we didn’t most of the time) you can be at the Jemma el - Fnaa in 20 minutes. While we at the hotel we enjoyed a Hammam, which I would certainly recommend. The Jazz bar (at the hotel) is a great place for pre or post dinner drinks. If you have some time to spare, check…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,"great place to eat, excellent food",The setting here is a great contrast to the busy streets outside. Here the setting is relaxed and shaded giving a great start to a meal. The food and service are both excellent though the restaurant was quite busy. After a busy tourist morning on the crowded streets this was the perfect antidote.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2018,5,The most welcoming staff and gorgeous Riad,"A group of us from work stayed at the hotel and had meetings for most of a week. The staff could not have been more kind and attentive to our needs. For example, they knew when to bring the tea and biscuits, and when to give us our space. They went out of their way to accommodate us in a genuine way. The riad itself is so beautiful - every door, carving, tile and lantern! It is a special place. When we checked out of the hotel, they gave us a present -- when I was thinking we should be giving them one! I left Marrakech after our meetings ended, and returned back to the city. My husband and I were welcomed back in (with welcome drinks) while we were waiting for someone to meet us. We also took the cooking class which was a delight.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2018,5,A Lovely Experience: Kindness at its Peak,"I entered La Maison Arabe after a grueling 26 hour journey with delays, undelays (yes that happens too) and other excitement that I would rather not have on a journey leading to a vacation. I arrived and was greeted by several people who carried my bags straight to my room, where my wife was already staying and was brought a refreshing drink minutes later. The hotel staff was amazing, from breakfast to being inconspicuous when they needed to be, to catering to us even after we left (more on that later) the hotel. The room was incredibly spacious with a balcony looking down into the pool. I didn't use the pool at the hotel but did go to the country club with a few other spouses (our wives were hard at work at the hotel; they all had a business meeting) and had a blast. We were…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2018,5,Solo travelled from nyc,"I have travelled around the world and stayed at some truly beautiful and luxurious hotels but la Madison Arabe just may be my favorite. Perhaps it’s the roses that are everywhere on the property, the delicious tagines and salad, or the gorgeous private country club that only guests may access. Or most probably it is the wonderful staff who are so kind and treat every guest as if they are a treasured friend. Thank you la Madison Arabe for making me feel like a princess during my stay!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 July 2018,5,Attention to detail and authentic charm,"I am a diplomat on posting in Morocco so I have stayed in many riads. I get a bit tired of the same over-ornate decor. Maison Arabe is certainly a classic riad but it is the real deal - the first one to be turned into a hotel. The rooms and living rooms are lovely, plush and comfortable. The highlight for me was dinner in the courtyard restaurant by the pool. The musicians, the Moroccan lanterns and the glimpse of the Medina ochre rooftops were very atmospheric. Service is impeccable, attentive yet unobtrusive. And I loved my birthday cake!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2018,5,A jewel in the heart of Marrakech,"This extensive riad has not only been superbly restored, but has been done so with today's discerning traveler in mind.

 June 2018,5,Perfect stay with an exceptional restaurant and bar,"This riad was in a perfect location, down a cozy, quiet alley. The room and bathroom was very large and I had a view into the courtyard. The outdoor restaurant is a must during any visit in Marrakech - even you do stay at the riad. A drink in the bar before dinner is a must - great piano player and friendly bartenders. Breakfast was wonderful - and served outside. On checkout I received fresh baked sweets and a cookbook. I would strongly recommend this riad to anyone.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Fantastic from start to finish.,"Fantastic! staff were next level wonderful, beautiful room with excellent bed. I could go on and on about how much we enjoyed the stay. Several riads connected to make one hotel. Pool and lounge were very nice, restaurants 3 star. Central location just a short walk to central market. We were booked three days and stayed six..I must emphasize the staff made this place, the hospitality was greatly appreciated. From the porters to the wonderful General manager they were on point. We did not want to leave and 100% will return.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Fantastic stay,"Stayed for 3 nights for rest and relaxation and a little shopping! This hotel was like a retreat, the country club during the day followed by short shopping trips and then an excellent meal by the pool being serenaded by a great Moroccan band. Just perfect!

 June 2018,5,3 night break in Marrakesh,"Beautiful hotel within the medina.

Haman was also very nice and the guide they provided was great.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,more than i have expected,"Maison Arabs’s staff were happy to help assist us with whatever we needed. The Riad was beautiful, from its courtyard to the stuning rooftop restaurant. The location is perfect, with an easy-navigable walk to the Square and the new town etc..... The hotel recommended a guide for us to spend a half day exploring the Berber culture in the Atlas Mountains, whose family is from Ourika, was a wonderful guide. He took us through the local Monday market which was the most unusual market we’ve ever seen. We had a lovely hike to a local Berber home where the couple welcomed us with their traditional green, mint tea and a delicious local meal. This was one of the highlights of our trip!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2017,5,Our honeymoon spot!,"Our experience here was divine. One leaves the dusty hot street, with noisy trucks, feral cats, and donkey carts to enter an oasis of calm and luxury. It’s in the old Medina, so you get the full Marrakech flavor. This was once Winston Churchill’s favorite restaurant, and after several renovations it has achieved ultimate status. Our room was large and beautifully appointed, and for us the call to prayer, heard from the window of our marble bathroom, was exotic. Food everywhere, especially breakfast in the room, was a feast for the eyes and the tongue.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2018,5,The Best Service Ever,"I usually don’t write reviews, but this time my stay at La Maison Arabe was so amazing I have to write about it. I am so touched by their extraordinary service. I travel around the world a lot, and this hotel is the best ever. This hotel beats the international brand hotels that we usually stay, hands down. We checked in late, really late. We learned later that we checked after they usually get off work. Still, they went out their way to cook me a meal. When we checked out for the airport, the gentleman( I feel so bad that I don’t know his name) prepared water and snack for our ride to the airport. it is only 20 some minutes away, it gets better, they even prepared the “ leaving country” form and with the info filled for going through the custom, I am so impressed. Well it…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Authentic & Delicious!,"A wonderful meal enjoyed by my partner & I, we shared the mezze board for two which was simply delicious and for main we had the lamb & pear and lemon chicken tagines which were cooked to perfection. The lamb was so tender and perfectly spiced, we also really enjoyed a glass of Moroccan red wine which was superb. The jazz bar before dinner makes for a wonderful setting!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Dinner and cocktails,"Our first visit to the La Maison was for afternoon tea, but we ended up having a few cocktails instead and we were not disappointed. The ambience of the riad was very welcoming, and also allowed seclusion from the 'outside world'. On leaving, we decided to go back for dinner and we were not disappointed with either the service, the food or the entertainment. For starters, we shared the equalavent of a tapas - the houmous was our favourite. Our main meals could not be faulted, neither the choice of wine to go with our meal. All in all a wonderful meal, the musicals were also brilliant. Since our meal, have been back for cocktails which sums up how much we like this riad.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,This is what true hospitality is.,"I am one of those people who read trip advisor but rarely post. But my experience here (leaving tomorrow) has been one of a kind and I need to let all travelers know. It is “easy” for a hotel to have beautiful public rooms, good shower heads and 1000 count sheets. Where true “professional hospitality” shines is in taking care of their guests with their hearts. This is especially true when the traveler is in need. Our family arrived here two days ago with each one of us having gotten varying cases of “traveller’s disease”, but one of us arrived ill. Management showed true caring and told us whatever we needed they were available. The next morning the family member was significantly worse and they suggested a doctor to come and they would have him here 15 minutes after he…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Amazing stay in Marrakech,"This was our first stay in Marrakech and we were lucky to be staying in le Maison Arabe. The hotel is a beautiful, rambling old building with no two rooms looking the same. Our room was very comfortable with a nice big bed and complimentary bottle of wine and local biscuits. The staff cannot do enough for you and can help with any problem or question you may have. It was my husbands birthday while we were there and they surprised him with some lovely cake and a glass of champagne each. The restaurants offer amazing food and we also did the half day cookery course which was great fun. I'm sure we will be back",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Fun and tasty learning,"We had a great time at The Maison Arabe cooking class. The facility is first rate and we made at anyone and two side dishes. We then had a lunch of our dishes and really enjoyed getting to talk to our fellow classmates. Finally, we each got a small tangine to take home. Very fun!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Top notch service,"Spent two wonderful days at this amazing hotel. Dined at both restaurants - excellent. I had a hammam and it made my skin just sparkle. As a solo female traveler, the accommodations, service were fantastic, above and beyond my expectations.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,One of the best,Can’t say enough good things about this riad. Incredibly attentive and personable staff. Grounds are immaculate. Room was spacious and interesting. Certainly no cookie-cutter hotel. Every detail was thought through and executed perfectly. Certainly a five star property.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service!","The hotel is like an oasis in the middle of Marrakech. Had it not been our first time in the city, the hotel seems to coax you to just stay in. Food was superb, service was excellent. It is the best hotel we have stayed in in terms of service and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels but the staff go out of their way to delight. Example when we arrived at midnight, the kitchen was closed but they were still able to prepare a meal for us..before going to the airport, they handed us our pre-filled departure cards. Overall kudos to the hotel team. We had a wonderful wonderful stay here and we would definitely come back to ! this hotel. We also extended out stay by one day. Again, excellent hotel staff, great hotel, superb food. During our extension we were upgraded to another suite…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Wonderful service and facilities,"From check-in to check-out, La Maison Arabe was a top-notch experience. In particular, the staff at the front desk was extremely helpful in giving directions and making reservations, which is crucial when visiting a city like Marrakech with its maze-like medina. They also negotiated cab fares on our behalf so that we would get the best deal and not be charged more than necessary. Additionally, the restaurant near the pool was charming and had terrific food, and our suite was immaculate. I can't say enough nice things about this place.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Amazing hospitality,"As if time stood still during our 3-day stay at this wonderful boutique hotel within the Medina of Marrakesh...A beautifully decorated Rijad hotel with an elegant and quiet room, superb Moroccan and international cuisine and a traditional in-house hammam. The outside pool was definitely a plus. We had our every wish catered to by attentive and friendly staff. Also participated in a Moroccan cooking class and enjoyed every second of it. Only a 10-15 minute walk from the city centre and only 30-40 km from the Atlas mountains, this hotel is an excellent place to stay at if you wish to get to know Marrakesh and its surroundings. We will definitely be back soon...",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Wonderful Oasis,"La Maison Arabe was a beautiful and tranquil oasis in this fascinating city. The service was superb, the food excellent and the size perfect. We shared the Royal Suite with my 2 teenage girls and felt as if we were living in our own mini-palace, terrace and all. My mother had a standard room which was spacious and beautiful. The beds were extremely comfortable (and I care a lot about this) and housekeeping did a wonderful job. The hotel was small enough to feel intimate, friendly and personal while not being so small as to feel limiting or intrusive. The food was the best we had in Marrakech by far (and my husband is a very discerning ""foodie""). We tried the hammam which was wonderful although there was a little bit of miscommunication about the ""disposable bathing suits"" you…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

We also enjoyed the jazz bar every night. I would highly recommend this Riad!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Wow!!,"A stunning restaurant in a beautiful hotel serving excellent food. I could not recommend this place highly enough. The service was exemplary and the food was not only beautifully presented ; it was also absolutely delicious. It is also excellent value for money. I hate to think what a similar experience would cost in London. If you go to Marrakech, make sure you go to LA Mason Arabe!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Dont miss the cooking class!,Super nice activity to do while in the city! The place is fully arrange for the class with streaming video to not miss anything. The teachers are very nice too. The food is freash and they give you a full explanation on spices and martocan food. We loved it!!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Hard to fault this high service boutique hotel,"Nicely located on the edge of Marrakech but within the city walls this hotel also boasts a garden / pool reserve a short ride from the hotel (by free shuttle). The hotel itself is very nice in a traditional style with outstanding staff who all speak English. Food and drinks are great, and the hotel offers cooking lessons which are superb. The rooms are well decorated and nicely appointed. Ours suffered with a direct line of sight from the sun terrace so for privacy we had to keep the curtains close most of the time (net curtains would have sorted this). The location allows you to walk to the souk / central square in about 20 minutes. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff - a truly excellent hotel",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,A beautiful Riad in Marrakech!,"We loved our stay, beautiful rooms, spa and the location is great! The breakfast every morning was lovely.

 June 2018,5,Luxury in the middle of Marrakech,"It is apparent as soon as you enter La Maison Arabe that you are in a high end full service establishment. Our room was large, well proportioned and fitted out to a high standard. Unfortunately on my first night i found the evening noise intrusive and raised the issue at the front desk ho advised that they were full but would see what could be done. Shortly afterwards I was asked to inspect a new room to see if it was satisfactory - being a ground floor suite with an outside courtyard it was more than satisfactory and the upgraded room was accepted with thanks.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Hard to fault,"Really a top class hotel in all aspects. Great room, beautifully furnished; excellent food and very helpful staff. It is also well located for walking to all the sights of Marrakech, which we did. Can't think of a single negative about the hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Amazing service and ambiance,"I stayed 4 nights at La Maison Arabe and everything was wonderful, they offer a truly special service. My flight landed an hour early, so I called the hotel and my transport driver appeared within 5 minutes. On arrival I was given a delicious local drink in the beautiful courtyard, before being escorted up to my room which was decorated with fresh rose petals (a lovely touch that reminded me of my engagement night at Raffles Hotel in Singapore!). The room had a view over the courtyard pool and restaurant, however was quite quiet in the evenings. The hotel has a beautiful, luxurious feel with 5 star attention to detail, combined with the feeling of a traditional riad. On our request, they organised a guide who took us through the souk, he really listened to what we asked for and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Do not miss!,Authentic and wonderful opportunity to learn about Moroccan food culture and to be taught by a Dada in a beautiful and professional kitchen. You also get to eat the meal you prepared with other like minded travelers from all over the world with a passion for food and cooking. Do not miss !,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Outstanding hotel,"The staff, booking experience room, food and public spaces were all consistently great. Most important we’re the staff with whom we became aquatinted and for whom no task or detail was unimportant. As a comparison, we are currently at the Riad Fez (in Fez) which is a Relais and Chateau property. They showed up after 10pm for turn down service. Then at 10:30pm, a server from the restaurant knocked on our darkened door asking that I give her cash for the tip I had charged to my room... seriously? I will hold the experience I had at La Maison as the high bar of great hospitality.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2018,3,A Blend of Fives and Ones = 3!,"Beautiful hotel with a lot of character and comfortable rooms, and the staff could not have been nicer and room service could not have been more prompt... If I were rating it for that, it would have been a 5. The hotel was nice enough to book 3 dinners for us, but when we got to the restaurant on the first night, they had no reservation. The second night we were booked for 19:30, but their staff didn't show up until 20:00, so we had half an hour to kill just sitting around. And then when we arrived at the third place which our guide also said was the best spot in Marrakech, we found that it was closed... on a Tuesday. The other negative is that it's down a side alley, which I must admit does have some charm, but there really isn't anything else within walking distance for an…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Beautiful hotel with exceptional service,"From check in until departure, we could not have been made to feel more welcome at Hotel Maison Arabe. All,staff are friendly, polite and attentive. The little things add up, a refreshing juice drink upon arrival when checking in, fresh flowers in the room, allowing us to avail of the hotel common areas after check out until our transport to the airport. Cannot find any fault with this hotel. It is beautifully decorated with many places to sit and relax indoors or outside by the pool. We also took advantage of the free shuttle to the country residence where we enjoyed a relaxing day by the pool with a lovely lunch.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Everything was perfect!,"I highly recommand La Maison Arabe. We stayed for 2 nights during our 2 weeks trip to Morocco and it was by far the best hotel we experienced. The service was probably the best I have ever seen. People were really nice and they were making us feel like we were really important to them. I also highly recommand the restaurant, especially for dinner. The place looks beautiful and the food is amazing. Again, the best meal we had in our 2 weeks trip.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2018,5,Honeymoon,"Fantastic Hotel. Our Hotel Suite was upgraded on arrival to the Royal Suite & Wow, it was luxurious. All the staff really go the extra mile to ensure you achieve all you could possibly wish for and more. They put petals in our room which included a heart shape on our bed which was a lovely touch. Both restaurants are fantastic. Both pools are lovely as are the offsite gardens. The atmosphere and ambience in the hotel are very relaxed. The spa & massage facilities are so calming. The location is great for experiencing the local culture. It’s like stepping out into another world when you go outside. We had a fantastic relaxing stay. Thank you Rachel & Ian",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2018,5,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed three nights last week with a large group. From the moment you arrive you are warmly greeted by a multilingual staff. Our garden suite had a lovely “living room” well stocked with water, snacks and fruit on our arrival. Rose petals decorated our bedroom and bathroom. The breakfast buffets were delicious and included freshly made omelets and crepes and lots more with seating inside or around the fountain. We had a delicious dinner and our group also enjoyed the cooking class and made delicious tangines. They even walk you to get a taxi to make sure you get where you want to go at a reasonable price. It was sad to leave. We highly recommend La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,"3 nights, amazing service","Best stay ever, the room was beautiful and the staff above and beyond the entire time.

Highly recommend for anyone staying in Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Wonderful hotel in the Medina,"Cannot say enough good about this hotel. The location is within the Medina, but is very easy to find and navigate. Staff is great. Restaurant is spectacular and always full. The pool at the hotel is heated. They also have a ""country club"" outside of town with a huge (unheated) pool and delightful gardens. It is accessible via free hotel shuttle. In my view it's the only place to stay in Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,"Great service, relaxing stay","We stayed for 5 nights to celebrate a milestone birthday. The service from everyone was attentive, warm and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. We stayed in the old part of the building which we enjoyed - lovely quiet room with small outside private area to sit. Loved going for a swim travelling by their little bus service to the country club and enjoyed a couple of salad lunches there. Had dinner by the pool at the hotel one night, fabulous service, food good nothing special ( we really enjoyed latitude restaurant, also food stalls 1 and 14 in the main square) Highly recommend the cooking school half day course on site.

 June 2017,5,The best resturant ever.,"We were in Marrakesh one year ago. We should have posted at review then. However, on reflection, Le Maison Arabe was one of the most memorable dinners we ever experienced. We celebrated the 45th anniversary of friends we were traveling with. The dinner was as memorable for them as us - in a VERY positive way. Make this a dinner experience if you are ever in Marrakesh..",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Worth the wait,"I have wanted to visit this restaurant for 3 years. It didn’t disappoint. Very good menu, exceptional service and the location is perfect.

 April 2018,5,Loyalist College Culinary Program at La Maison Arabe,"What an amazing experience we had at La Maison Arabe in Marrakech. We spent a morning learning about spices and Moroccan cuisine and then were led through a cooking class from Chef Fetiha. She was amazing. Happy and fun, smiling as she guided us through the preparation of traditional Moroccan cuisine. The facility was thoroughly professional and the staff was the most customer service oriented we experienced in all of Morocco. We shared a delicious meal (made by us) on the roof top dining room and all the while felt like honoured guests. I highly recommend La Maison Arabe for a meal, a cooking class or just a visit to their gift shop. You won't be disappointed.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Marrakech delight,"I just returned from a trip to Morocco that was nothing short of amazing and part of my visit was in Marrakech at La Maison Arabe where I stayed three nights. The location is ideal as it's in the center of town, near the square and to the souks so it's very convenient and easy to find. My room was huge with a sitting area, balcony and fireplace. I had a separate room for bide and toilet as well as both shower and tub! Heaven :) I loved the intimacy of a small riad that is well staffed. I dined at the international restaurant near the pool and had the most delicious dinner of marinated lamb chops in a yellow curry sauce that was divine! Breakfast was a smorgasbord of fruit, pastries and eggs. I also ordered coffee one morning in my room and it came in under 5 minutes. The riad…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2018,5,"Authentic Marrakech, with first rate service and food.","Over 5 days, this palace and its amazingly attentive and helpful staff met every requirement and exceeded my expectations. The public and private rooms are beautiful. My room was large, had a balcony and a very large bathroom. Food in the restaurants (an ""international"" and a Moroccan) was superb. The staff, however, gets the greatest possible thanks. All are multi-lingual. Their French and English are excellent. Their sense of service bespeaks first-rate training and a serious commitment by management. This hotel is centrally located to much of historic Marrakech, My inaugural visit was a joy.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,4,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed a week here and had a lovely time. The staff was very attentive and friendly, and all the restaurants were great, as were the rooms. However, if you want a quiet room make sure you aren't facing the pool -- one of the hotel's restaurants is adjacent to the pool and it is a favorite of locals it seems and it can be very noisy at night, there were 3 nights of birthday celebrations when we were there. We wish the hotel thought of their overnight guests more in this regard.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,amazing oasis of calm with amazing food and service,this is a gem of a place .

Book for dinner if you get the chance.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Excellent food at a fair price,Marrakesh rain was bucketing down ... most restaurants are open air which was not a good idea on a night like this. La Maison Arabe was recommended and didn't disappoint. Pricey by Moroccan standards but the quality shone through. A place to fit in before the Dirhams are all used up (take plenty).,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Amazing place,"From the lovely iced mint drink and delicious cookies when we arrived and on, it just kept getting better. Beautiful hotel, our room was incredibly lovely. The breakfasts were terrific. We had a problem with our flight arrangements, and the staff were exceptionally helpful in getting us in touch with Amex to try to straighten it out. We also had dinner in their traditional menu venue. The food was excellent with very good music. I was expecting over the top prices on this, but it was fairly reasonable. The location is also very good--fairly close to the Medina.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Amazing hotel,"We loved every minute at this hotel. The room was spacious, luxurious and comfortable. The customer service was outstanding. The ambiance was so much fun and relaxing.

 April 2018,3,Beautiful Riad but staff inflexible.,"We had three nights at this beautiful Riad that is in a great location in the Médina, but very close to the new part of Marrakech. The decoration at the Riad and the rooms are really done very nicely. Our room was VERY small with not a lot of space to put luggage. So, not sure if all the rooms are this small. The cooking classes that they offer should not be missed (see separate review). We had dinner at the Moroccan restaurant, which was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Definitely had better tagine in Fes. Staff are all super friendly, but I feel they were a little inflexible. Our tour company had arranged the lowest category room, which was fine, however, I feel that we were given the WORST room in the Riad. We were on the first floor overlooking the courtyard that…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Ultimate 5 Star Experience,"We had an amazing stay here. It was the perfect retreat after days walking around the souks.

I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else if we returned to Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Top Quality,"From the moment we arrived until leaving 6 days later, we were treated with warmth, professionalism and hospitality!

 April 2018,5,Beautiful Riad,"We had a wonderful stay at this Riad. It has beautiful spacious junior suites, a lovely courtyard and delicious Moroccon restaurant.

 April 2018,5,Delicious and authentic dinner experience,"Thoroughly enjoyable dining experience; we had our most outstanding meal in Marrakech at La Maison Arabe.

Love the live arab-andalusian music, the service is impeccable.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,A great cooking school!,"Of our two weeks in Morocco, the cooking class at La Maison Arabe stood out as a highlight. Every student had their own stove-top, every student had a video screen showing what was happening up front. This was not just watching a chef prepare the local foods, it was a hands-on course where we chopped, cooked, and seasoned dishes that were authentic to the region. My congratulations to Muhammed our chef, and to all the staff at La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Epic cooking class,"Very good cooking class, well instructed and the food tasted amazing! There were various chefs in the room to supervise the cooking, the set up was structured and clean. Each cooking station fitted two people, with each their own sink, hob and chopping area. Also a screen to better see the lead chef in case you were far away. The ingredients were of good quality and fresh. Highly recommend.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Perfect escape amongst the bustle,"It was a perfect stay in Marrakesh, the location of the hotel was at the edge of the Medina which meant it we a short walk away from any crowded places, yet close enough to be amongst it all. Everything was perfect, the staff, the service, the restaurants and the country club felt traditional yet always with a sense of luxury. I would definitely recommend it, we loved our stay.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2018,5,Best Moroccan cuisine,"I will qualify the review by noting that my wife and I were battling severe jet lag when we dined here. Nonetheless, we found that the decor and ambience was very elegant - almost stately. We picked a bottle of Moroccan wine - which turned out to be pretty good and paired it with chicken and fish tagines. My wife couldn’t make much of a dent into the tagines, but I made an effort to sample both dishes. Both tagines were well balanced in their flavors without overwhelming the senses. There was obviously a lot of effort and crafting that went into the creation of these simple dishes. My favorite though was the fish tagine which reminded me of “steamed fish” from Bengal. Service was very attentive. The restaurant had 2 seatings - 7.30 and 9.30pm, so advance reservations are highly…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 April 2018,5,The Perfect Place to stay in Marrakech,"My daughter and I have just arrived home after a 3 night stay in this wonderful hotel. It is exactly as the pictures depict on the website and did not disappoint in any way. The décor is traditional but stunning, the service impeccable (nothing is too much trouble) and the location is perfect. It is walking distance from all the good sites and there is a complimentary shuttle service on the hour to and from the country club (residents only) where there is a fabulous pool, sunbeds and food and drink for a restful afternoon after walking around the centre. I would recommend this place to anyone- fabulous!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2018,5,Trip of a lifetime,"My wife and I took our three sons, one daughter in law, and one fiancée to Morocco for our 30th anniversary. We stayed at La Maison Arabe for the last four nights of our trip, where we enjoyed the spa, took two cooking classes, toured the city with expert guides arranged by the hotel, and had a feast at their spectacular annex on our last night.

 April 2018,5,"Character, service and personality- Riad at its best","We stayed with 2 families for 4 nights in this stylish and historic Riad full of beautiful surprises. The location is outstanding- within the walls of historic Marrakech but still accessible by taxi. From here you are at walking distance to the souks but also close to all the good restaurants, etc. What makes this place special is the character and historic details of the building, stylishly decorated with Moroccan carpets and furniture. The true value is the staff. They organized all our excursions, transfers, booked our restaurants. Always great suggestions and keen to get feedback. It was like staying with a good friend.

 March 2018,5,Nothing but perfect!,"We, a family of 6 with also young kids, stayed here for 4 nights. The location is perfect - it's only a few steps away from the souks. All of the staff has been absolutely great and welcoming: always (and I really mean always) super-friendly smiles which is not necessarily the case when you travel with little ones. Food in both restaurants has been amazing; same applies to breakfast. If there is one thing they could change: charging separately for each Nespresso capsule in the rooms doesn't seem to be adequate. All in all: we can only highly, highly recommend and we would come back at any time.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2018,5,Simply top notch service,"My husband and I stayed at the Madison Arabe for two nights and enjoyed every bit of it - they checked us in early, upgraded us to a beautiful Riad suite in traditional plush Moroccan style, with our own private garden, and we thoroughly enjoyed the Restaurant as well as our Hammam and massage experience. Staff everywhere - the breakfast team, the Restaurant, the reception team, cleaning staff and doormen bellboys - all were attentive, professional and cheerful. Everything was as expected of a 5 Star Riad but they went beyond that when it came to service. As someone said on another review - staff here seem to anticipate your needs even before you need it.

It's nice small hotel but with a lot of different places to enjoy after a day of visits and walking: piano bar, 2 restaurants (both very good!), solarium at the terrasse and other terrasses in the shadow and close to the pool, spa and hammam ... Our rooms were warm which is not always the case in Marrakech in January and the wifi is working perefctly!

This upscale ""oasis"" has a lot to offer (and take advantage of): multiple excellent restaurants, bars, the haman (really excellent - try it!), great rooms, exceptional service and staff, and a cooking school. Arriving at our room, we found rose petals scattered beautifully throughout. One evening was chilly and the staff brought, laid and lit a fire in the fireplace of our room - aaaaaah...!

It reminded me of being in the wine country in California. The cooking class is very well organized. I forgot the teachers name, but he explained about the food we were going to make before proceeding the the kitchen. We had mint tea and bread before our class, great experience!

Outstanding! Breakfast, too, was delicious. And I had a great massage at the spa.

Our room was lovely with the added bonus of having the most comfortable beds and bedding and the best hot shower of anywhere we stayed while we were traveling. Breakfast is a buffet, loaded with many, many choices besides being able to order ready made eggs and/or waffles. The spa is in a lovely, quiet, peaceful setting where we had a relaxing massage one afternoon after days of sightseeing. It's just a short walk to the fascinating central square and medina.

The meal and service was superb, the only thing I would fault would be that the portion sizes were far too big, I couldn't finish my main course.

I must have emailed La Maison Arabe a dozen times prior to our arrival and they were always accommodating, prompt, and helped me with anything I needed. Our arrival was seamless and our room was gorgeous. The hammam is probably one of the best in Morocco and I treated myself to their 3 day offering.

 March 2018,5,A Royal Moroccan treatment !!!,La Madison Arabe hotel/riad is magical! It’s the new hybrid style of hotels in Marrakech where the structure is an old beautiful Moroccan riad but you still get all the treatment of a five star hotel. When you arrive you must ask for Sofyan. He is amazing. Sofyan gave us a very warm welcome into the hotel. As soon as we arrived he handed us a delicious Moroccan mojito and was completely at our service. He seemed to know everything! La Maison Arabe is a place with great history. We soon learned how well known and famous the hotel is. Rightfully so! The service was top notch! We will definitely come back here very soon.

 March 2018,5,Loved every minute at this hotel!,"This is a beautifully decorated “Riad” near the Médina that has superb service. We stayed in the royal suite which had three levels. First was a bathroom and living room, second was the master bed and bath and third was a private terrace. The decor was beautiful. One complaint was that the AC seemed to only cool downstairs and not upstairs. The hotel itself is in a great location where you can get dropped off almost in front and it’s a short walk down the alley. Please note that Riads inside the Médina require a lot of walking as cars aren’t allowed inside. Whereas here, you have a short walk to the hotel and a short walk to the Médina. Food here is superb. It has one of the best Moroccan restaurants. It is recommended to make reservations as it fills up quickly. Breakfast…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Exceptional service,"This has to rate as one of the nicest places we have stayed anywhere, offering comforts and facilities you would probably expect in much larger establishments. From the initial check-in (with fresh drinks on arrival and unexpected room upgrade), and guided tour of the hotel, the room itself (very spacious and comfortable, with complimentary water, pastries and sweetmeats), the complimentary afternoon tea (and morning coffee too on one occasion) to the two restaurants (fine food at both). I could go on. We availed ourselves of the so-called ""country club"" for one half-day - more a villa on the outskirts of the city than a country club - and in spite of being apparently the only hotel guests to do so on that day, we were graciously treated and waited on. Lunchtime salad in the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2018,5,The Travel Genie Granted My Wish,"I first came to Morroco 2 years ago and stayed only two nights at La Maison Arabe. I knew then it was a place I hoped to visit again. This week (March 2018) I returned with a friend who had never been to North Africa. I SO wanted everything to go well. It did. We were greeted by the staff with broad smiles and from the first moment, treated to that exceptional Moroccan hospitality. The hotel is an aggregate of 19th century riads located inside the historic Medina, a UNESCO Heritage Site. The three story building, which you enter from a nondescript side-street, is a geode of fabulousness. Every door opened and every corner turned reveals sparkling Moroccan style and craft at its very best. The staff quickly learned our names and our food preferences (LOTS coffee with…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2018,5,Fine Dining,"We visited La Maison Arabe last night to experience fine dining at its best. We ate in the elegant main restaurant, Monkfish and a Chateaubriand served to perfection. The Riad itself is so elegant in every way and is perfect for a special evening. The service was also so attentive.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,A wonderful Moroccan experience in a very special hotel.,"My husband and I love to travel and we've been lucky enough to be able to go to many beautiful and interesting places in the world. We've stayed in wonderful hotels, but none won our hearts the way that La Maison Arabe did. From the moment we arrived, we knew we were in a special place. The staff greeted us in such a genuine and thoughtful way that we immediately felt at home. We were give a tour of the hotel and fell in love with the beauty and authenticity of the various rooms. If you've ever had a fantasy about Morocco, La Maison Arabe will set the perfect scene for your dreams. We were shown to our accommodations, a lovely room with a private balcony overlooking the pool with a view of the city's roof tops. There were flowers in the room and on the terrace, a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Simply the best!,"This amazing place is an oasis in the middle of a busy and sometimes unpleasant city. We made the big mistake of not staying there during our 5 days in Marrakech but were allowed to visit daily for dinner in the fabulous restaurant or just sit in the peaceful piano bar. What can we say that hasn't already been said, it is just perfect in every way. The surroundings are fabulous, the staff are the best you will find anywhere in the world and the food perfect. Yes you will pay a little more but this can only be expected for this luxury and level of service. All the staff were top notch but we particularly wish to compliment a member of staff who works the piano bar. His name? Midchi. One of the nicest, polite, efficient persons you will ever meet, look out for him in the piano…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2018,3,Not so great and not five star on this planet!,"Very disappointing. I cannot believe that Experience It Tours suggested this place with La Mamounia down the street. There were dirty linens on a chair upon entering the room, the stairs getting up to room were medieval, the tiny bottle of wine in the room was addressed to MR. H, which neither Mr. H’s were on the trip, the service was luke warm at best and on and on. This really put a damper on the trip. Luxury is luxury and anything less than that is average.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2018,5,The best Moroccan suisine experience,"I had the pleasure of participating to a culinary lesson in Maison arable and I found the experience unique , enriching and very authentic. The staff were very professional and helped us cook a delicious Moroccan tagine which we . In addition to their delicious food, la Maison Arabe is one of the most professional run Moroccan guest house with very high end services and with an easy access location close to the famous Square and to the moderne part of the city of Marrakech. I highly recommend this lovely property and its extraordinary food experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2018,4,"Lovely Hotel, Poor Service","This hotel is a beauty tucked away in the Medina. The decor is beautiful, very authentic with traditional appointments. Our suite was roomy and beautifully decorated, but very “ chopped up”. A sink in the water closet would have been nice. There was not enough room in the bedroom to place suitcases so they needed to be in a sitting area. The most challenging thing about this room was the two and a half flights of narrow spiral stairs. The staff at the desk was accommodating but the restaurant staff was rude and indifferent on the night we had dinner there and one breakfast. The second day breakfast had a different crew and they were more pleasant. All in all, the service was not up to par for a luxury property. I would recommend this hotel with the caveat to be…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2018,5,The most beautiful hotel I have seen in 40 years,"La maison arabe was our hotel for a 3 days longweekend in Marrakech and it turned out to be the perfect decision to book that place. Everything, literally everything during these three days was perfect: the team, the room, the ambience, the spa and hammam, the location, the food, pool, breakfast... It's an incredible oasis in Marrakech, so friendly and warm, so nicely designed. We travel lot but never experienced such a perfect place. We had room 222, which is incredible and large - certainly a recommendation. Next time I would book a cooking class in advance as well as a hammam slot every day. We will be back!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2018,5,Romantic & Great Service,The Maison Arabe is a fantastically romantic place ....the music /ambience/ simmering pool and excellent team make it a wonderful experience. the team have the balance perfectly right between being attentive but also not being obtrusive. Wonderful oasis of 5 star luxury just off the medina and souks . To be honest the food is good but not phenomenal and better can be eaten in Marrakech....but that is not the point of Le Maison Arabe !,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Fab!,"I loved my recent dinner at the Maison Arabe, what a night! The food was traditional Moroccan with a modern twist, the wine was great, the setting was spectacular, the live musicians were hugely entertaining but still classy and atmospheric. Foodwise I found the pastilles and red snapped tagine my highlights and I thought it was excellent value for money. I’ll definitely go back when I’m in Marrakech next",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Extraordinary hotel and staff..simply beautiful and so very helpful and nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I was very fortunate to be in the Royal Suite (on 3 levels)...living room and one bed/bath on first floor...another bed/bath on 2nd floor and....on 3rd floor beautiful terrace with chairs tables lounges and huge Jacuzzi tub with water massage.. staff kept facility very clean and comfortable and well lighted...service above and beyond....,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Fabulous,We stayed four nights here and the hotel couldn't be faulted. The suite was amazing. The staff friendly and efficient. A nice touch was the daily selection of homemade pastries in the room along with constantly topped up water and Nespresso capsules. Ate well in both restaurants but the Trois Saveurs environment made it a memorable evening. We also did the half day cookery course which was fun.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Moroccan maximalism par excellence,"The nondescript alleyway access to La Maison Arabe could hardly offer a greater contrast to what reveals behind the modest entry. Even the foyer is an understated entrée to an overstated opulence that slowly reveals as the inner passages of this superbly creative reconstruction of a cluster of eighteenth century medina courtyard residences are explored. This was the finest riad we have experienced in Morocco and up there among the most appealing accommodations we have come across worldwide. It was more akin to being a guest in a luxurious local residence than in a hotel. The good: our suite 218 “Jasar” was extravagantly spacious, sumptuously appointed, conspicuously clean and as quiet as a tomb. Everything expected was there and it all worked as expected. The king bed was…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,A good hotel like this is hard to find.,"We stayed for a week in February. The hotel is hidden down a narrow street but as soon as we went through the door we found it was a beautiful place to stay. Our room (211) was actually a mini suite and was very comfortable. We found cozy lounge areas with lots of very tasteful ornaments, furnishings and pictures. Very Morrocan! There was a well stocked bar where a jazz pianist played each evening. As this was our first time in Marrakech we booked half board as we did not want to waste time checking out restaurants. We found the food to be very good and alternated between the traditional Morrocan restaurant and the international one that served a variety of European and East Asian dishes. There were no restrictions as to what we could choose from the menu with our half board…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Don’t Miss the Hammam,"This is an absolutely delightful hotel/riad in the old city...a really hidden gem (both figuratively and literally) down a small alleyway. The service from the front desk staff is super; very helpful and genuinely concerned that you enjoy your stay. The rooms are well appointed with good bathrooms. But what is not to be missed is their Hammam. This was our first experience of one and it’s a real indulgence. You first enter a steam room where you are washed down and then your whole body is exfoliated, and then washed down again. You then have a wonderful massage. La Maison has two restaurants; traditional Moroccan and international. We had dinner our first night in the Moroccan restaurant, which also had two musicians playing through dinner. The dishes we had were…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Dinner,"This is an extraordinary place to have dinner, located in the old city of Marrakech an accessed via a small alley the hotel is s hidden gem. There is a piano bar for pre dinner drinks and I recommend a table outside in the small pool courtyard. Not cheap by any means but well worth a visit for dinner, the food is excellent.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Perfect from check in to departure,"This stay was our splurge on our trip and as a young couple, we were surely not the average patrons. But it was an absolutely wonderful experience. The staff is excellent and they don't miss a detail, from remembering our names every time we walked in or out to offering any assistance we needed with anything. We went to their private gardens about 15 minutes away for a nap by the pool (there is also a gorgeous pool at the hotel) which was also a wonderful experience. Afternoon tea and cookies by the pool was a joy, service at breakfast was supreme, everything about the place, pool, patio, and rooms is gorgeous, and generally the entire experience was spectacular.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Paradise with all the trimmings,"What's best about this place... the romantic setting? The beautiful rooms? The authentic history? The amazing food? The Jazz Bar (straight out of a James Bond film)? Or, that big Winston C himself loved the place? The most important thing for me: this place has the best staff of any hotel I have ever been to. Adil (who I think is the manager) gave us (and everyone he was dealing with) VIP 5-star treatment. I would come back to this place a hundred times, just for the service. Marrakech is brilliant but quite mental! Having this oasis of calm to return to at the end of a crazy day is the best decision we ever made. It is paradise.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,A lovely hotel with fantastic staff,This hotel is well situated in the Medina and close the the main square. The room was large and comfortable. The public areas relaxed and the swimming pool warm and inviting. The two restaurants proved very good food in lovely settings. Altogether what one might hope for from a hotel of this class. But what sets it apart from any other of the many hotels I have stayed in is the staff. Every one of them is incredibly friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. They manage the difficult task of providing excellent service without it ever appearing effortful. I really cannot speak too highly of them.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Excellent food,"We went here on our last evening. The food was excellent particularly the lamb tagine. We had a great Moroccan rose wine as I had a fish tagine. The restaurant is fashionably casual chic, so you don’t have to dress up, however atmosphere is a bit stuffy. But if it is 5 star food you are after then this is the place to go. One small word of caution, they can’t make a decent espresso martini.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Absolute Class!,"We went here for dinner and it was an absolute pleasure. The building,atmosphere and staff makes you feel you are in an exclusive restaurant. The food was very nice and the live music at night was very good. It is worth a visit!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Outstanding,"The accommodations are great, the staff is fantastic, the dining is superb. They clearly understand what it takes to please a visitor. When I mentioned a concern about getting lost while going through the Medina they offered to lend me a cell phone in case I needed assistance getting back to the hotel. I've stayed at a number of Five star rated hotels and this clearly reaches that standard. Knowing I was booked into a five star hotel I had some reservations as I walked down the pathway to the hotel. Once inside it immediately became evident that this was a first class establishment. If there was any doubt it was erased at the international dining facility. The restaurant is one of the best I have encountered.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,Our home in Morocco,"It is our third visit now to La Maison Arabe with our 2 boys and it always gets better and has truely become our home in Morocco. We wouldn't stay anywhere else.

 September 2017,5,One of the very best!,"A true gem in Marrakesh, very warm and friendly staff, fantastic chap in the bar. piano bar was fantastic with pianist playing.

 December 2017,5,Beautiful Hotel.,"Marrakech was the last leg of our 2-week trip to Morocco and we were tired and ready for pampering by the time we arrived at La Maison Arabe. The staff really delivered. Our room was lovely - very comfortable, spacious and clean. We ate breakfast each of the 3 days we stayed there and dinner one night. Also enjoyed tea and welcome cocktail. Everything was delicious and thoughtfully presented. We really enjoyed the traditional design of the hotel and all of the lovely authentic materials and designs. Highly recommend.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2018,5,Beautiful hotel,"We arrived in the early afternoon from a long desert trip and were quickly taken down for a welcome drink, a walk around the hotel with a guide to show us all the different amenities and then up to our room which had a large basket of fruit, fresh flowers, and a complimentary bottle of wine. The room had a large king sized bed and sitting room with two TVs. We booked the junior suite that had a large balcony overlooking the pool which I would highly recommend. The hotel has two restaurants, a jazz bar, spa, heated pool and sun terrace that can be used by all guests. Welcome - 5/5 Staff was very welcoming, took our passports for copying and filled out our forms for us, which was a nice change from most other hotels in Morocco.

 January 2018,5,Amazing service in beautiful surroundings,"My wife and I and our adult son and daughter were treated to two days of refined, caring service in beautiful surroundings. We felt like honored guests in a friend's home. Every need was anticipated and quietly attended to, including a 5:30 am departure breakfast. Dining at the restaurant with live guitar music and having drinks listening to a fine piano player in the jazz bar were highlights as well. Our room with its balcony overlooking the indoor pool was wonderful. One of the more exquisite hotel experiences we have had.The Rough Guide has it exactly right: while La Mamounia is the best known hotel in Marrakech, La Maison Arabe is the ""classiest"" place to stay.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2018,5,"Family run in three old buildings with interior courtyards, crammed with antiques, trilingual staff.","We had a three-day weekend break from our normal Paris routine. The large, branded hotels were too expensive. Could not have made a better choice, browsing the Internet. Located close to the Medina (old city), its front door is hidden down an alleyway, so the arrival is definitely not ""ritzy."" Once inside, you feel as though you were being hosted in a traditional palace. We took the cooking class, now housed in a separate building with a top class setup: sink, stove, workspace for each student, plus a personal TV screen to see clearly what the instructor is doing. Made a chicken tajine, two salads and a dessert, then went down with the other dozen students to eat what we had cooked. Really top quality throughout.

 January 2018,5,New Year’s Eve was Extraordinary,We were a group of 22 people for New Year’s Eve that included teenagers 20 somethings and their parents and nobody was disappointed. First of all the setting is extraordinary completely authentic historic and beautiful. They adorned us with Fes hats and beautiful pashmina scarves and there was entertainment throughout the evening including musicians and belly dancers and so much food that it just piled up throughout the night. The champagne was flowing at midnight and we were all extremely happy with the service the location and the food and drink. A New Year’s eve to remember for sure!!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2018,5,3rd time in La Maison Arabe,"For us it was 3th time in La Maison Arabe. It is the hidden gem in Marrakech. The hotel is extremely beautiful, always we feel like returning back home. The staff is always willing to help and always sunny. It is located walking distance from the Djemaa El-Fna market if you are exploring the city, but it is also definitely the hotel to relax during your stay. Hammam and spa is gorgeous and must be visited. If you want to find best tagine in Marrakech you will find it in the restaurant of La Maison Arabe.

 November 2017,5,Stunning boutique hotel in the old town,"Wow well what can I say? This hotel was recommended to me and I can see why. From the moment we arrived, the service from the friendly staff was impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble and they were only too happy to assist with any needs we had. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. They were spotlessly clean and luxuriously furnished in traditional style. We had dinner by the pool on our first night and it was stunning. So atmospheric with the added bonus of very attentive service.

 January 2018,5,Excellent food in a historic surrounding,"The history of La Maison Arabe goes way back. We heard that it has hosted celebrities such as Winston Churchill, Jackie Kennedy and the Aga Khan. You can really sense the long and exciting history of this riad in the beautiful dining room, jazz bar as well as in other parts of the hotel. We ate dinner on a Monday evening. The athmosphere was romantic and there was a musician playing Arab music in the background. We ordered traditional Moroccon lamb specilities. The food was excellent and the portions were big. They also serve wine (unlike some other restaurants in Marrakech). The only minus comes from the lady who escorted us to our table - obviously it was not her best day. Otherwise the staff was nice and polity. Recommend highly!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Luxury Boutique Riad within Medina,"True 5-star experience within Medina walls. Impeccable and friendly service.

To improve - service in Jazz bar. Too slow by a mile... Quality of breakfast- so little can help it so much. Quality of food needs improvement. Wines - search the best Moroccan wines and serve these at good prices. Not difficult and we had so many elsewhere during our trip. Hence an easy win. Fill up amenities in rooms - pay attention to women. We NEED conditioner! Or we can't go out! The spa was great. The international restaurant was not great. Big effort to improve can be done - as the location and hotel is so good just make some changes and you will never lose the clientele. If not you will because of the cost. Relative to others.

Each member of the staff is so kind, polite and helpful: they helped us with everything we needed and always had a smile and a nice word when we got to the hotel after a day out.

There are candles lit everywhere at night which made it lovely and atmospheric. The room 221 was gorgeous although we had no view at all. We were slightly overlooked which made it difficult to open the bedroom curtains and this in turn made the room dark and difficult to put make up on. We were given a free half bottle of lovely red Moroccan wine and some little chocolates/pastries. A nice touch. Plus we were given a free bottle of water each day (it was 40 dirham for the same bottle of water during lunch or dinner!!) The food was…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,A wonderful experience!,"We spent five wonderful days at La Maison Arabe. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms comfortable and well appointed, and the staff is very professional, friendly and helpful. My wife took a cooking class and said it was the highlight of our trip. We look forward to returning to Marrakech and will definitely stay here again. It exceeded our expectations on every level.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,A superb experience!,"La Maison Arabe is a most excellent hotel. The staff are very helpful, the rooms comfortable, well appointed and have all the ameneties you would expect from a hotel of this class. The fact that it is put together of 4 or five houses maks it feel like a very luxurious rabbit warren. The Jazz Bar is lovely and the two restaurants are excellent with attentive and quick service and delicious food. This establishment cannot be recommended highly enough. The hammam in the basement is also a delight. The in-house moroccan cooking school is also well worth a visit for a lesson.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,unforgettable experience in marrakech,"We've just spend 5 days in Marrakech in La Maison Arabe. what a great experience : very professional guys, excellent service, cosy rooms and dining room, spas. everything was great but on top of that these people are so nice, doing there best to make us confortable, like in our own family. The food is great (may be one of the best place in Marrakech) please experience it",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Nothing Could Be Better,"We spent one heavenly night at La Maison Arabe and wished we could have stayed longer. The whole experience was absolutely perfect. The hotel, bar and restaurant staff could not do enough for us but they were never intrusive. They seemed to magically appear when needed and had at their finger tips what we desired. We mentioned that we planned to go to the new Yves Saint Laurent Museum and they had tickets at the front desk so we did not have to bother standing in line which we would have had to have done. The bell man flagged a taxi and told the driver where we were going and told us the correct price to pay. This was a tremendous help because after having much experience with Marrakech taxi drivers, it was a pleasure to be taken care of with the right information. The…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Fabulously helpful staff and very relaxing experience,"My fiancee and I stayed at La Maison Arabe for a weekend of relaxing and warmth. The staff was beyond helpful. The concierge helped arrange taxis, dinner reservations, guided tours, and even purchased tickets to Le Jardin Majorelle in advance for us so we could avoid the line! We did a 3 day spa package and it was fantastic. The hammam was super relaxing and cleansing, then the massages were the perfect follow up for relieving stress and tension. We ate at both restaurants and the food was fantastic and traditional. Tea and small bites every afternoon by the pool was a nice treat. The pool setting was beautiful, but surrounded by dining seating, so more for a quick dip than vigorous swimming. There was a small sundeck with room for 8-10 sunbathers. The bar setting was…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,A True 5 Star in Marrakech,"An amazing oasis in Marrakech.. The best 5 star hotel we’ve ever stayed at. Guest rooms are spacious and clean. Most of the rooms overlook the pool and the courtyard. It’s a 10 minutes walk to the Médina (city center). The food was delicious, honestly the best food we had in Marrakech. Make sure you dine by the pool.. The staff is another story, all are friendly and courteous. They go out of their way to help. We were greeted by Murad who gave us a quick tour of the hotel. Murad: thank you for making our stay the best it can be, you were amazing!! Thanks for the tea and the delicious sweets, among other things. Adil: thank you for everything, you were very helpful and incredibly welcoming. We plan to return with our triplets..",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Finger licking good!,We had dinner La Maison Arabe one night while in Marrakech. Hands down the best meal we had in Morocco. My wife had Chickin Couscous and I went for the Lamb Tagine. Both were excellent. The lamb in particular was ridiculously tender. Service was top notch as well. This will be a meal that's difficult to top. One can say the only downside is the price. For me it was money well spent though. Tip: you'd do well to reserve in advance. We were lucky to get a table without one.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Excellent Cooking Class,Did the cooking class here and it was brilliant. Really well thought through and presented with excellent facilities and a great explanation of Moroccan cooking. Would definitely recommend it for anyone in the area.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Outstanding in every way,"La Maison Arabe offers 5 star service in all areas. Our room was lovely and all the staff regularly went above and beyond with their service. We both celebrated our birthdays here and they really made it special for us (cakes, singing, rose petals). The pool area is beautiful, as is the courtyard and we loved the welcome drinks we had there too! Breakfast is great - a big selection in a lovely setting! There is also a complimentary afternoon tea every day which is another nice touch and the restaurant is great. Nothing is too much for the staff here and they really will go out of their way to make sure you have the best stay possible! La Maison Arabe combines a traditional moroccan riad feel with 5 star hotel luxury and we cannot recommend it highly enough.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Wow! Service so good you’ll be want to live here,"Apparently, the word “no” has not made it to the vocabulary of the staff here. If you’re still looking for a place to stay in Marrakech you can stop now because you’ve found it. Adil , Mourad, and the rest of the staff treat you like you’re their closest relative. From recommending a great guide, to fetching a local SIM card, negotiating a flat fee for a taxi TO and FROM hotel (without even paying upfront), having a car ready at the airport, setting up a last minute cooking class at the hotel (an absolute must!). And the bartender is quite the character. The service is just stunning and oh so rare in the world. The room we stayed in was fantastic. Comfortable and pleasant. You’ll see other reviews rave about the rooms, no need to repeat.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,GIRLY TRIP TO LA MAISON ARABE NOVEMBER 2017,"La Maison Arabe is a true gem, hidden in the back streets of Marrakesh yet a stone throw from the main square. The staff are so friendly and helpful, they make you feel safe, they even gave us the hotel mobile phone and told us to call them if we felt in danger anywhere, that really is going beyond the realms of duty! The hotel is amazing a warren of different areas, the food is devine. The first night we ate in the outside restaurant surrounded by Arabian candles, the atmosphere was charming....I cannot recommend highly enough everything about our stay.....100% impressed !",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Beautiful Old buildings,"Highly recommend anyone visiting Marakech to stay in this hotel. It is a combination of several old buildings made into one hotel. Not your standard layout but good signage keeps you from getting lost. Architecture is beautifully articulated and preserved. Room was quiet, room service was fast, and the staff was delightful and very helpful. Hotel is located in the hear of Marrakesh, but down a very narrow alley, making it rather difficult to find. Thankfully we had a guide. Its odd location however, makes it a very quiet hotel, other than the music from the hotel itself, we heard no noise. Views were all courtyard which is where the pool is, or the smaller courtyard; all beautifully landscaped. It was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend this hotel to…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,Amazing! Must visit.,"Restaurant at La Maison Arabe is open to everyone and the menu is ‘exclusively’ Moroccan, you can also do cooking workshops at this hotel that are world famous! It has always been somewhere I had wanted to dine but had not had the chance too. Whilst staying in our riad, Mohammad who manages Riad Tizwa had suggested we eat here one evening and kindly booked us a table. From our riad it was walking distance, however it is quite easy to get lost so Abdo walked us there and it looked so easy… We got a taxi back as we were going to the Royal Mansour for drinks afterwards. Once inside it was the most beautifully elegant setting, we were sat by the pool and everything was lit up, it was very romantic! The ambience was lovely, relaxed yet refined and the staff were first class and very…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,One of the best hotels i have ever been,"Monsieur Adil Chaif at the reception is amazing. So kind and gentle. Monsieur Rashid and his legendary hotel bar is unique. Compared to the other 5star Hotels, the ""Maison Arabe"" is the best Hotel because it carries character. The other 5 stars Hotels are amazing but you can find these luxury palasts all around the world. The ""Maison Arabe"" is luxury at it´s highest Level in combination with local unique character. One of the greatest Hotels we have ever been.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Marrakech adventure,"This city has always been on my bucket list. My family and I booked rooms at the La Madison Arabe. Incredible service, wonderful rooms, great location, extremely helpful and friendly service staff throughout the entire hotel and our stay. The food was excellent, the rooms were unique and beautifully decorated. The location was near the old marketplace which was enchanting and full of amazing crafts with superb quality. We had a guide and a driver while in the city which made the experience personal and tailored to our needs and time schedules. I cant wait to return and see more and understand the culture better. We were accepted with open arms everywhere we went and felt safe during our visit.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Absolutely the best,"An amazing stay for three nights and four days! The minute we walked in we new we found our quiet oasis. My husband and I were exhausted from our travels throughout Morocco so when we got to La Maison Arabe we were ready to relax and unwind and that we did! From the minute we stepped in we were received and treated like royalties. The staff were amazing and answered all your questions and met our requests. Location is fabulous; tucked in a quiet street but only a 15 minute walk from the square. We also treated our selves to a deep tissue massage and the Royal hammam and were surprised at the level of service. We would highly recommend this place and we definitely would go back. Oh, did I mention the food?! Delicious! Thank you for a memorable stay!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Luxury in Marrakech,"After having toured throughout Morocco, we spent our final three days at La Maison Arabe. Nothing like saving the best for last! Everything about this hotel is first-rate; spacious accommodations, attentive and friendly service, the restaurants and even a jazz bar. Being located within the medina puts you right in the center of things in Marrakech. You can easily walk everywhere; especially convenient in the evenings. The guest rooms are quite large, and most have balconies. Make sure to try one of the pool-side restaurants one evening...both the food, the music and the ambiance are spectacular! What I found most appealing about La Maison Arabe is that you do not feel as though you're in a hotel, but rather within a traditional Moroccan riad. Who could ask for more?",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Top Service!,This hotel is amazing! Absolutely no complaints at all. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We definitely recommend the Hammam Spa & massage package especially after a long day treking up the mountains. We stayed for 3 nights and felt like we are from the royal family!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Great Dinner Venue,"We stayed as a family at a hotel outside the city centre and they recommended this place for a dinner in the medina. What a great recommendation. Lovely food around the pool/courtyard. Great service and great atmosphere. We wish we had done the half-day cooking school here - maybe next time we will. If we came as a couple for a mini-break, we would stay here.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,One of the best 5 stars hotels i’ve stayed in.,"Impeccable service, friendliness and attentiveness at this beautiful and very comfortable hotel. Great location in the Medina, a few meters from the square Jemaa el-Fna. The special evening Lightning invites you to an intimate dinner in one of its fine restaurants. If you go to Marrakech do not hesitate to stay at this magnificent and cozy hotel",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,My new favorite hotel.,"From the moment we arrived, I was made to feel like this magical place is home. The staff provide the highest standard of service - it feels like they’re delivering from the heart. The architecture of this building is so special. It’s a bit like a maze. You never know what you’ll stumble upon. Even on the last day of my stay, I stumbled upon a rooftop terrace I hadn’t known existed. It’s all so vibey. The satellite swimming pool (country club) definitely worth a visit. La Maison Arabe is what Moroccan luxury is all about. Thank you to Rajaa for all of your help. I can’t wait to come back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Beautiful! Wonderful place!,"I loved my stay here. The hotel is a gem. So authentically stunning. The rooms, pool, restaurants, spa and common areas are so warm and welcoming. We had s wonderful time at the cooking school too. Can’t wait to return!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Exceptional Comfort and Hospitality,"From the moment we stepped into this splendid riad, we were showered with smiles and offers of all types to try to make our stay nothing less than perfect. 2 things struck me immediately upon arrival: the warmth and friendliness of the staff, and the sophisticated charm and energetic vibe. The property itself is gorgeous, and it is located conveniently in the medina, but in a quiet area away from the raucous of Jemaa el-Fna and the souks. Time to walk to the souks is about 10-15 mins, 15-20 mins to Jemaa el-Fna Ours rooms, 218 and 245, were breathtaking. The balcony in 245 looked down at the pool/dining area, which was gorgeous at night and permeated by a great vibe and filled with elegant Moroccan live music. 245 was like a mini palace! It had a nice little courtyard.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Time for a nice meal in Marrakech,We were recommended this place by fellow travellers. A great variety and choice on the menu of top quality food. We chose a couple of vegetarian options which were sensational. We started in the air con restaurant for our starter and main dishes and then we transferred to the courtyard pool area for our sweet. The band were playing traditional music all in all a fabulous ambiance and a beautiful setting to enjoy some sumptuous gastronomy. The local red wine merlot? was very reasonable. The fact this place was favourite of sir winston Churchill when he was in town added to the romance although now bearing no resemblance to the eatery that he frequented after significant refinement back in the late 90's. Reasonbly priced.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Amazing Service and Location,"We loved staying here because of the central location. We also loved the service, restaurant, spa, and cooking school. We took fully advantage of everything it had to offer and it exceeded our expectations. I highly recommend the La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Very nice dinner,"Good atmosphere. Lovely food. We had the risotto and the lamb, it was divine. The deserts were also excellent. Very nice staff. Would come again definitely. It’s recommended to book in advance A bit pricey but worth it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,An unbelievably great experience,"A perfect stay, it truly could not have been bettered. We booked this at relatively short notice to accompany our daughters who had managed to find a very cheap riad in Marrakesh in August. They then wanted some moral support. After a little internet work found this, relatively close by and booked - our first trip to Marrakesh and yes, in the heat of their summer. The stay here was just perfect. From the first welcome with refreshment after a days travelling to fond farewells nearly a week later, no thing was too much trouble for the staff here; little fresh bread rolls at breakfast, help with navigation and travel around town, places to see and do, to winding down with evening piano playing or a trip out to their 'hidden' garden with a large pool. We had a delightfully…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,A homely touch with the warm Moroccan hospitality,"My wife and I spent three nights at this lovely boutique hotel and we felt at home. The premise is a gradual expansion from a humble restaurant to a luxury yet homely hotel that retains its history, characters, and charms, while added the modern luxury and convenience. Their choice and quality of food were memorable. La Maison Arabe offers a range of culinary options on site, including the lovely Moroccan restaurant that its degustation menu is highly recommended, the international restaurant, and the alfresco breakfast by the poolside. Their spa and hammam area is one that we enjoyed - it was tastefully decorated and their signature Royal Hammam is superb. We didn't have time to visit their country club which is 15 minutes away by private shuttle, and attended their cooking…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,A lovely meal,We went to this restaurant after trekking the meal was really good. The bar was charming Winston Churchill had stayed there. The restaurant was next to the pool the orange soup was nicely prepared and presented the lamb shank was perfectly cooked and my friend’s steak was also good. The cream brûlée top hadn’t been properly caramelised it was taken back graciously the wine was good and the sommelier was knowledgable. A good choice for dinner,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Superb!,"This is possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in (and I have stayed in many). The service is excellent, nothing is too much trouble and the food is very good. There are only a couple of dozen rooms, so the staff all get to know you by name and are relentlessly cheerful and helpful. The hotel is really beautiful, the rooms are very comfortable and the whole place smells divine. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Marrakesh. My only niggle is that the wi-fi was very flaky, but other than that, I cannot fault this hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,A fabulous place to stay!,"Our first trip to Marrakesh and we had the amazingly good fortune to land at this wonderfully welcoming and friendly, comfortable, and fascinating hotel. We truly can't wait to go again. It is like a magical wonderland, little private areas perfect for relaxing in, museum-standard works of art dotted around, a lovely pool which we much enjoyed using, a splendid hammam, a renowned cookery school which I will have to make use of next time we visit - there has to be a next time. Perfect location for exploring this incredible city. The staff are all so friendly and helpful, nothing too much trouble, lots of generous touches, wonderful breakfast and excellent restaurant(s). Thank you to all the staff for making our stay in Marrakesh a delight.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Recomended,"The interiour was so beautiful - red and mustard yellow, dark but cosy and a very romantic place. Arabic style. Felt like we traveled back in time. Exelent food and service. There are also a bar with wonderfull coctails.(with or without alcohol)",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,The best,"This may be the best hotel I've ever had the pleasure to visit. It is one of the two most beautiful, with its small courtyards, beautiful wood and tile work, pool-side restaurants, and spacious rooms (we had a small suite, I did not see a standard). Second, the food in the two restaurants is excellent -- all traditional Moroccan in one, a variety in the other. The settings for the restaurants are each gorgeous, in different ways, and dinners were accompanied by live soft lute and guitar. We took their free shuttle to their ""country club"" pool -- another beautiful place in among olive and pomegranate trees, herb gardens and pond, where we would relax in sun or shade, swim, or enjoy a snack or light lunch. Finally, what made this stay for me was the friendliness and service.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,Lovely hotel that was just the ticket,"Our first experience of Moroccan culture and the start of our trip was at La Maison. What a delightful, quirky building complemented by attentive and friendly staff, for whom nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel welcome and relaxed straight away - a real oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of marrakech, with the heart of the city only a short walk away. We had a hammam which was great and did a cooking course in the associated school which was fun and would recommend both. We also made use of the pool which was a great environment for a tasty breakfast - the local pancakes were awesome!! Would heartily recommend La Maison for anyone heading here who wants to be close to the action but the chance to unwind...",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,Exquisite Old Moroccan Dining Experience,"La Maison Arabe was transformational.

 September 2017,5,Treated like a V.I.P.,"I spent 4 nights in this lovely riad/hotel with my 22 year old daughter as part of a 12 night trip to Morocco, Throughout the stay we were treated to exceptional service by every member of staff, who all seemed to sincerely wish that we had the very best experience in the hotel, and out and about, ensuring we were warned of such issues as ""faux guides"" in the souks. The location is good, being 10 minutes or less from the main part of the medina, once you learn to negotiate the route without getting lost. Paper maps are useless. My daughter downloaded google map for the area we were in; we were then able to find our way around with only a few wrong turns. The building is beautiful, but its various sections provided a mixture of styles and periods, which only added to the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The venue and the ambiance was a surprise for everyone. Maison Arabe and Nabilia are a first-class team that provided a level of personal detail in organising my soirée. It was a pleasure working with Nabilia and her incredible and reliable staff to create a memorable and successful experience for me - from the beginning stages of planning two years ago, through all of the decisions on decor, food, entertainment, etc., and then seeing it all come together on the day of the big event was spectacular with a few surprises added to fully enhance my birthday.

 September 2017,5,Old world elegance and charm,"Our first trip to Marrakech was last January. We stayed at La Maison Arabe and fell in love with it and with the country. We recently returned from our second trip to this gem of a riad. We stayed two nights prior to doing a 4-night trek, then stayed two more nights on our return. It was like coming home. Happy, familiar faces and staff greeting us so warmly. Staff and service are unparalleled here. From Moustafa at the front desk, to Rashida, the beautiful woman who greets guests who are dining there, to the impresario, Rashid, who's domain is the elegant and comfortable jazz bar.

 September 2017,3,Fancy Rhiad with some issues,"La Maison Arabe is a lovely place with great decor and style. It feels somewhat overdone, in terms of the old city, at times with guests often dressed, perhaps quite properly, to match the grand atmosphere. If one likes a more relaxed way of life there are other Interesting and very fine Rhiads. Le Maison Arabe has some issues that can be irritating. In at least a number of rooms the Carrier brand air conditioning units display the temperature on very large LCD panels in bright white light that means the bedroom is far from dark at night. This is an extraordinary oversight by the management. The hotel seems sometimes places essential citronella oil style lamps in the rooms - without advising. These may be intended to deter mosquitoes but can make the room unpleasantly scented.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2017,5,An Amazing Birthday,"We stayed here for about a week, including my birthday. Everyone was extremely friendly and accommodating. They even arranged a birthday surprise for me at the Jazz Bar where the pianist played happy birthday accompanied by the staff. It was very sweet. Adil at reception was a great help with setting up our mobile and assisting with transportation and other needs. They do currency exchange right at reception which makes it extremely convenient.

 August 2017,5,"WOW,,,,",The entrance of La Maison Arabe is in a narrow street you can easily overlook. The restaurant is part of a small hotel (Ryad type). Once inside we were overwhelmed by the beauty of the place. You have to walk through a few aisles to get to the dining area. On the way take some pictures. The restaurant has its tables spread over two floors around the swimming pool. We were seated on the first floor and had a marvelous overview of the open sky patio. Later at night a duo seated at the swimming pool would play music for the guests. The friendly waiter helped us choose the dishes.

 August 2017,5,The most wonderful hotel,"We returned this year for our 4th visit to La Maison Arabe, so you can tell how much we love it.

They go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Clearly, they are proud of their hotel and enjoy working there. This year, we noticed a marked improvement in the quality of food served in the poolside restaurant. Last year, it was good, but this year it is excellent (there's a new chef, I believe). I wholeheartedly endorse all the rave reviews here. I read the very few negative reviews and honestly cannot understand how anyone can write in such terms. My…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2017,4,"Beautiful space, wonderful service","I only stayed for one night - but having come to Marrakech several times, I've always been curious about staying. I arrived early in the day, and the staff was able to accommodate me and give me an early check-in. I waited about 30 minutes by the pool with some delicious pastries and a great coffee while they readied my room. Having taken a night flight from Johannesburg to Paris, I was ready for a shower and to refresh and was fed, showered, relaxed and out the door again for a long day of work by noon! I came back that afternoon after a long day and started off the evening in the piano bar. The service in there was so fun! I was treated like a VIP (maybe because I was the only one in there to start) and they took such good care of me. The drinks were great, the piano…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,Customer service at its finest!,"Absolutely loved our recent stay here! The hotel and grounds were beautiful. Every staff member went above and beyond. The front desk arranged a tour guide, made excellent dinner suggestions, and arranged transportation. The spa was relaxing and affordable. The daily breakfast was delicious and the restaurant at night was one of our favorites. Highly recommend staying here and be sure to try a cooking class! Can't wait to return.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,The customer service was exceptional,"Me and 2 other friends stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. What sets this hotel apart from others is the customer service. The staff is very friendly, proactive and helpful. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I highly recommend this and will most likely come back to this hotel in the future.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,Stunning,"We ate at the restaurant after seeing the scenery reviews and were not disappointed - the ambiance was stunning; so romantic. The food was exceptional and reasonably priced and the service was first class. Definitely recommend it, especially if you want to do something special. (Only criticism was that there was only wine, no beer on the drinks menu, but that wasn't a big deal for me.)",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,Beautiful dinner date,"We are staying in a hotel just around the corner and we're recommended this restaurant from one of the customer experience managers in the hotel. She said if we want fantastic, authentic Moroccan food then this was the place to come and wow she want wrong. We went for a drink before on the hotel bar, complete with live piano for background music, and were greeted by friendly and helpful a staff who were extremely attentive to us the second we walked in. The building itself is stunning and everything I was hoping that Marrakech would be - it is absolutely stunning, to the point of being shocked as you are taken down and walk into the restaurant courtyard. The service and food were absolutely incredible - I recommend the Moroccan salad to start and the lamb shoulder for mains.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,They did it right,"Came her for my wife's birthday. They gave us everything we wanted and more. Great room upgrade without request, room spanned around an entire courtyard. Came in to a bottle of wine and treats from their bakery/confectionary. Private terrace with chaise lounges, sofa. Fireplace. The room was more like 6 rooms, at a killer price. Underground spa was great, highly recommend steam bath and just relaxing. Bartender was a lot of fun and kept martinis flowing. The manager and front staff were always great. When we had a small issue, they made it right no questions asked. This is the way hospitality should be. Thanks Maison!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Exceptional experience,"One of the most authentic experiences of my life. Every day I was wow'd by the staff's attention to detail and exceptional service. Our tour was exactly what we wanted (arranged by the hotel), relaxing at the Jazz Bar with one of the best non alcoholic drinks I've ever tasted was amazing, and the restaurant was out of a magazine. **The SPA** the hammam was one of the best experiences of my life. To relax in a tranquil, gorgeous space was exactly what I needed to forget about life back home. For henna lovers, Henna Cafe is a 5 minute walk. Supporting local women is a must! The Square at night is a must see (10-15 min walk). I would advise having the hotel set up airport transfers. We got majorly ripped off (300 dirhams) by the taxis at the airport. Adil, you are a 5…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,EXCEPTIONAL in every way,"Before I get into the overall review, I want to highly recommend that you take the Cooking Workshop!!! I guarantee you will leave saying ""WOW."" Overall, our time at the property felt exceptionally elegant and romantic. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. It was our first time in Morocco and first experience staying at a Riad. We were celebrating our birthdays and an overbooked flight delayed the start of our trip there, but our experience at the property made up for it. They were so attentive to our needs and put extra special touches on our stay.... rose petals all over the room, a bottle of wine upon our arrival, and Moroccan pastries. They also sat us at a beautiful table poolside in the restaurant, which…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,One of the best Moroccan restaurants in Marrakesh,We went three times in the week we spent in the city. Very fine Moroccan salads and main courses. Service excellent.Ask for the tangia Marrakshia which is lamb cooked in a clay container. It is a speciality of Marrakesh and is well delivered. Prices are not exceptionally high.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Saved the best for last???!!,"So the head waiter Rachid told me, ""you saved the best for last"" when we arrived... didn't give it much thought but boy was he spot on with this comment!! Magical night starting in the Piano Bar. Piano player was fantastic (looked like a Moroccan Lionel Richie) and we had two Moroccan Mojitos from the bar... Well appointed with leather wall covering and ornate wood trim. Transferred from the bar and into the restaurant. We entered a beautiful indoor courtyard garden pool that is flanked by seating on three sides. A band played on an elevated platform on the opposite end and the music floated to the open air to create a beautiful ambiance. The food was excellent.. we both had Tangia but started with the Orange Soup... please order this.. it is a must!! Ended the night back in the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL!,"Such a beautiful hotel, with the most wonderful, helpful staff (LOVED our bartender who could not have been nicer!!). The rooms are beautiful and the riad is centrally located. Cooking class is a must do!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Hard to Beat,"Excellent experience from start to finish. Adil Chaif is the BEST host I have encountered in 25 plus years of travelling for work and pleasure. The Riad is very well run and all the staff are helpful and friendly and a visit to the ""Country Club"" is a must.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,"Either end of a desert trip, fantastic","We stayed two nights before a trip into the desert and a night on our return before leaving for London. The whole experience was fantastic. A late night welcome including complimentary wine and pastries, a cool room to welcome us from the heat and everything we asked for ready on our arrival. A guide, a restaurant booking, storing luggage while away in the desert, taxis.. nothing was a problem Great room, great restaurant, great location and great service. Would recommend to anyone and one of the best hotels we've stayed in around the world. You won't regret staying here",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Simply perfect,Experience was everything my wife and I hoped for and more. The hotel staff cared for our every need and thought ahead to make sure we are always taken care of. They truly defined what 5 star service should be. Thank you for an amazing memorable stay.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,"Lovely stay, well located","We had a very nice experience at La Maison Arabe. We stayed for three nights. The hotel is located just outside the medina. It's a beautiful space, and the food was excellent. We really enjoyed the complementary breakfast and tea. We also took a cooking class during our stay, which I can't recommend highly enough.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Orient Dream,The Royal Suit is Oriental perfection and sensuality. I highly recommend the hamman spa and restauration.All the management and the differents teams are exceptional !!! One of my worldwide best experiences. We will definitively come back soon,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2017,4,"Great hotel, ideally located","Me and my wife stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in a suite. The hotel is ideally located 5-10 minutes walk away from the medina and approx. 15 minutes drive from the airport. In advance of our stay, the hotel organized our transfers which although slightly more expensive than a normal taxi, meant that we were met on arrival and had a fixed price trip in an air conditioned car. On arrival, the staff did everything they could to ensure the hotel exceeded our expectations. We had a tour by the manager while our bags were taken to our room. This included an explanation of the sites nearby, restaurant recommendations and assistance with booking a guide or excursion outside the city. The hotel is more geared to adults, which for us was a bonus. The hotel has modern features, but is…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2017,5,Loved La Maison Arabe Marrakech!,This hotel is so charming that I could have enjoyed going to Marrakech just to stay there. The spa is enchanting - a must do. The rooms are beautiful and spacious. Everyone working there is focused on customer service. It's in a great location - an easy walk to the big market. If I go back I will definitely stay there again. Love it!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Dinner and drinks,"I brought my 11 year old daughter here, twice, based on the recommendation from our Riad owner. Beautiful architecture, ambiance, and wonderful customer service. Food was outstanding! We ate both times at the piano bar. Very relaxing atmosphere. I recommend the refreshing drink with lemon and mint. I had it both times and it was perfect after a long day in the Moroccan heat!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Really lovely traditional riad,"I spent ages trying to choose a hotel for Marrakech for myself and my two teenage children. I couldn't decide whether to be further out and have a hotel with space and a big pool, or whether to have a riad in the city. In the end we went for La Maison Arabe as we wanted a more authentic Morroccan experience walkable to the sights and not a big chain hotel. This, in hindsight, was definitely the right decision. One of the biggest draws for the hotel was the fact that it has a 'country club' complex about a 15 minute drive from the town centre which we really liked. There's a free shuttle bus to and from the club and we found it perfect. There's a big pool, sun loungers and bar/eating facilities. I would recommned La Maison Arabe for this facility alone as it means you get the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS I'VE EVER STAYED IN!,"This place is truly magical. After weeks of battling between a big hotel like (The Four Seasons) or a traditional Riad... we decided to do La Maison....and I'm so glad we did! If you're like us and like to explore, have a bit of pool time, amazing service, and enjoy great food. La Maison offers it all. From our airport pickup, to the hotel greeting, to the amazing upgrade of our room, to our anniversary dinner, to our day at their property by the pool, to the bartender who each day made us a delicious summer cocktail, ending with a thoughtful parting gift. This hotel is one in a million. The staff really goes above and beyond to make you feel so special. Thank you for such a perfect weekend! We hope to be back one day.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Great Moroccan Stay,"The La Maison Arabe is large riad-style hotel, with several riads stitched together in a maze of hallways (28 rooms i think) and a top cooking school, spa and restaurant all on site. Its location is good, about a 10 minute walk to the Jemaa el Fna, but the best aspect of this hotel is its incredibly helpful staff. They helped us with general directions, car service, bus tickets, taxis, cooking school and spa appointments at the hotel but my sense is that the service is great at all the top Riads/hotels. Perhaps its most differentiating factor is access to a second ""country club"" location with a larger pool with day beds and lounge chairs. It was a great break in the afternoons from the chaos of the Medina. Our room itself was fine, the breakfast was good (you should be able to…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Magical Moroccan hideaway,"We rocked this Casbah, perfect getaway with lovely staff and the most amazing massage! We love this vibrant city with its secret hideaway oasis. Looking forward to visiting the Atlas Mountains and purchasing a plate or 2 :)",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2017,5,nice hotel and service in good location,"good breakfast, nice rooms - not great or huge, but nice. good property. their offsite pool is really nice and worth visit. Rooms a/c, tv, great spa and treatments - book ahead of time. Spent 4 nights. 2 in city, one day trip to high atlas, 1/2 day cooking class, 1/2 day pool. great city. must be one of top hotels in city.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Hidden gem with lots of amenities,"La Maison Arabe offers a lovely stay. Breakfast is superb with fresh eggs, crepes, and all made with local products. They have a spa area and a hamam, where you can do the bath, get a massage or facial and etc. 2 delicious restaurants onsite, one offers traditional moroccan food and the other offers more european options. The ambiance in both is great, with live traditional music being played. The european restaurant (that still features some moroccan dishes) is outside in a surrounded courtyard near the pool and also serves lunch. The hotel is nice because it is within walking distance of the main square and the souks, but is away enough from the hustle and bustle that you get to relax and have a nice time.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Beautiful and Tranquil Stay,"We spent three nights at La Maison Arabe. We enjoyed their fabulous hospitality in the hotel, restaurants, and spa. Because the Riad is so elegant and beautiful it was hard to venture out. We enjoyed delicious meals, great bar service and fabulous massages at the spa. With there being a time change which was confusing due to the change back to standard time, the front desk called our guide and made sure we were picked up on time for our flight. Our every need was attended to at all times. Our room was a suite and over looked the beautiful pool. It was quiet and serene.We will definitely return to this wonderful spot on our next visit to Morocco.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,A hidden gem in the heart of Marakech,"It might not look much from the outside but, once inside, this Riad is gorgeous. We stayed 2 nights in a stunning room after having been upgraded to a suite because it was our anniversary. There was even rose petals scattered around the room for an extra special touch. The staff were friendly and very helpful with great attention taken to every little detail. We ate in the Les Trois Saveurs on both nights which has such a lovely atmosphere with tables positioned around the pool and local guitarists playing. We would highly recommend it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Superb stay at La Maison Arabe!,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in June and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. The service at the hotel was spectacular. We had two tangines to take home I asked if they had any way to pack them and they said ""yes of course"" and took them and bubble wrapped them for travel. We had dinner with a Moroccan family one night and the hotel prepared an box of pastries for us to take as a gift. The staff was always so friendly. Not stuffy or pushy at all and made us feel extremely comfortable and welcome. Also the hotel itself was absolutely beautiful and every detail was attended to. We had dinner there one night that was excellent and relished in the breakfast spread every morning which included everything you could imagine...made to order eggs, cereal,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,All we expected and so much more,"I did a substantial amount of research and chose La Maison Arabe due to the huge number of excellent online reviews. We were looking for a small luxury riad in the heart of the city rather than a larger resort such as La Mamounia, and we were thrilled with our choice. Our suite was the size of a New York apartment, with private terrace, comfortable living room, leather paneled bedroom, ample bath and small office. We arrived to fresh flowers, Moroccan wine and pastries, and the most gracious service we've experienced. Rachid the Barman was delightful, other staff equally helpful, and there's a reason the traditional restaurant is among the best in the city. The location was perfect, too. My only complaint is that the hotel charges for the in-room Nespresso pod coffee. A hotel…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Cooking Class,"A group of us enjoyed a lovely morning cooking class, and later ate our efforts. We learnt to make a chicken pastilla, and also cookies and a salad, which in Morocco often consists of cooked vegetables. The team that was teaching us was excellent, and we had a lot of fun learning to prepare pastilla which many of us had earlier only eaten at restaurants without understanding how to make its parts. We made individual round pastillas. I am now ready to cook at home. The cooking class facilities were set up separately from the hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,One of the best dinners out there,"We went to the Moroccan restaurant for dinner and it was definitely one of the best foods in town. La Maison Arabe put a twist into the repetitive traditional dishes (which become boring after a day or two) and made them interesting. Out of the good restaurants, this was one of the best ones overall. For appetizers, we had the three traditional pastillas (vegetables, chicken, and lamb). As mains, we had the slowly cooked (over coal) lamb stew and couscous with seven vegetables tajine. We would recommend these mains and appetizer. We also had mille feuille, lemon cheesecake, and lemon tart as desserts. We would recommend the cheesecake and lemon tart for the dessert, but not the mille feuille.Service was OK. They also had live music which was fun to listen to.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2016,4,Lovely Moroccan Style Hotel,Lovely place with lots of nice decorations at each nooks and crannies of this hotel. The interior is much nicer than the outside with a true Moroccan style. Touring the hotel is like a treasure hunt. The atmosphere is cordial and relaxing.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Superb Restaurant - Just what we were looking for,"We went for dinner at this charming hotel in the city and we ate in the La Trois Saveurs restaurant, which was wonderful. The tables are in an atmospheric courtyard surrounding a pool and the food and service were excellent. I really couldn’t fault the evening. Should I return to Marrakech then I would most definitely stay in this hotel and enjoy the superb Moroccan cuisine. Highly recommended for dinner, as I can’t yet comment on the hotel, but it looked absolutely charming.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Worth the Price,"We had a suite with a huge room and a private patio. It featured a leather lined walk in closet and a huge modern bathroom. It was in an area of the hotel suitable for people who have mobility problems. The decor was Moroccan chic. Never before have I seen a brass holster for the hair dryer or a silver sleeve for the mineral water. The room had a small bottle of wine, water and Moroccan pastries waiting for us on the coffee table. The breakfast around the swimming pool was a highlight for me. A Moroccan cook prepared msemmen pancakes and botbot rolls in front of our table. Other than that, you name it, they had it. The omelette and scrambled eggs were outstanding as were the fresh juices. I also liked the afternoon tea and the jazz bar. Dinner around the pool featured two…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Perfect romantic evening,"If you wanna have perfect romantic experience being in central in crowded yet so calm and quite with candle atmosphere, nice relax music, arthritic environment, friendly staff and delicious food. It's expensive but it's worth it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,"Beautiful, Peaceful and excellent service","An absolutely wonderful hotel that made our trip to Morocco magical. From the lovely rooms and beautiful common areas to the impeccable service, we found the hotel to be absolutely perfect. We stayed at La Maison Arabe for 4 days and loved every minute - we had several dinners at the wonderful restaurant, used the hammam twice, and loved the delicious breakfast. We also appreciated the high level of service provided - everyone was very accommodating, friendly, and extremely helpful. The staff really made us feel welcome and were a highlight of our stay. When we return to Marrakesh, we will certainly be staying here again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,4,A Lovely Stay . . . quiet amid the hubbub of the Medina,"Good hotels and riads all have one characteristic in common. Friendly, professional service. La Maison Arabe, one of the most popular riads in Marrakech, is no exception. Questions are answered promptly and all inquiries are addressed immediately. As with other riads, the access to rooms and restaurants can be challenging. Multiple staircases and levels and even an elevator create an air of mystery when searching for the restaurant or even the bar or exits. That's part of the charm of La Maison Arabe. Rooms are well furnished and wifi is readily available. There is a hamman and a minimal hair salon (come with clean hair; there are no facilities for personnel to shampoo.) The best part of La Maison Arabe? The adjoining classroom set-up for Moroccan cooking lessons. …",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Perfect in every way!,"From the moment we arrived last week until we checked out 3 days later, our experience at La Maison Arabe was perfect. The staff was attentive to our every need. If we asked for anything, the staff replied with ""consider it done"" - and it was! My husband hurt his knee while we were walking in Marrakech and the staff brought ice bags to our room numerous times. When I said I wanted to walk to a pharmacy to buy a knee brace for my husband, the front desk manager insisted he would send one of their employees to get the requested item. The bellman delivered the perfect knee brace to our room in 25 minutes time and they only charged us the price of the device. When we arrived we were greeted with a refreshing welcome drink. When we got to our room, we were greeted with rose…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Best Riad!!,"Amazing place!!! Good location, in the Medina and walking distance to main sites. The Riad is beautiful decorated, immaculate, superb service and amazing food. They offer cooking classes and the locations for those are gorgeous. This Riad is the best in town. We recommend this place and will go back, hopefully soon.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2016,5,Excellent choice!!,"There are so many hotel options in marrakech it can be overwhelming. From traditional riads to luxurious hotels.... Being Moroccan, I get solicited a lot from friends about where to stay in Marrakech and I always recommend a riad. To me, La Maison Arabe really offers the best of both worlds, in its authenticity and luxurious set-up. The boutique feel gives you the assurance that you are given a personalised service whilst still enjoying the luxury and amenities of a grander property. Its location is also key as it is in the North part of the Medina and a short walk to the Koutoubia. I was traveling solo on this occasion and as a Moroccan woman, I felt safe and welcome (you'd be surprised how many properties would turn away a woman travelling alone in Morocco). The staff are…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Dinner,Stayed at La Maison Arabe for Dinner. What a lovely place! Ask to be placed near the pool! They serve marroccaine as well as international dishes.

 April 2017,5,Exemplary in every way!!!!,"La Maison Arabe has been one of the best hotels I've stayed in during my extensive travels. It is a small boutique hotel in Marrakesh, a ten minute walk to Jamaa el Fnaa and the souk. The building is beautiful, a combination of several riads. They have blended these buildings quite seamlessly into one hotel. The decorations and furnishings are lovely. They have a nice pool, seating area around the pool, lots of little reading nooks all over the hotel, and a really great bar. The bartender, Rashid, is awesome! The service in the hotel also is exemplary! We got there on my husband's birthday. They arranged for a cake for him and sang happy birthday and made our evening very special. They also filled out our departure forms and gave them to us the night before we checked out! They…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Fine dining in style,After a long exhausting day getting lost in the markets we decided to treat ourselves. This was my personal culinary highlight of the trip (and that's saying something). The lamb was mind blowing! It fell of the bone! We had the lamb tanjia and the lamb shank... both were incredible! Cocktails at the bar are also well worth checking out. We aim to come back and stay here in the coming years.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Marrakech Gem,"A beautifully decorated, wonderfully run hotel in a quiet location. Our room was spacious and exquisitely furnished with a large private patio. I wish I could've brought home the closet. There is an offsite swimming pool in a lovely garden-like setting where lunch is served, located 15 minutes away by free shuttle - a great way to escape the heat. The staff, especially Adil, could not be more helpful or friendly. Hospitality seems to be in great supply in Morocco, but never more than at this special hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Way beyond expectations,"Head down an alley that looks like every other alley in the medina of Marrakech and stop at a beautiful wood door. But It is not until you cross the threshold of this door and see what lies behind it that you will be truly impressed. The hotel is a maze of intersecting hallways. There are indoor and open air lounges, fountains and beautiful furnishings throughout. No detail is overlooked. The staff is extremely nice and thoughtful. The rooms are spread out through the different levels and corridors so you will not find yourself walking down a hall of rooms. The staff will greet you with a Moroccan mojito which is a cold cocktail of pineapple juice, ginger and mint. The room we were assigned is lovely and well appointed. Like many of the hotels inside the medina there are…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2017,5,Beautiful Riad,"This Riad is made up of 3 properties that are interconnected often through a maze of stairways which sometimes get a little complicated. We stayed in a Junior Suite which consisted of a bedroom area with seating and desk, luxurious bathroom with huge walk in shower and separate tub, plus sitting room with walk out balcony. Several high quality restaurants, one beside the pool, luxury Hammam, delicious breakfasts, together with another property off site you can use as well. Plus 2 bars for a glass of wine or late night drink. Everything is 5 star luxury here, well located, staff who are friendly and very helpful. This Riad, is all the things they talk about when they discuss why you should stay in a Riad rather than a hotel in Morocco. The perfect place to escape from hot, busy…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Fantastic meal,"My wife and I ate at LA MAISON ARABE last night and it was a delightful experience. The setting, personnel and food were all exceptional.

An added plus was the live music - background music - not too loud but just right, played by very talented musicians. We must return soon!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2017,5,Fabulous hotel/Riad,We stayed here for two nights last week. Ideal position for seeing the sights. The staff were amazing..welcoming and efficient. The hammam is a must.

We have a sitting room, a terrace overlooking the huge mosque, and all of the amenities you can imagine! This hotel has a wonderful SPA, two pools, and two restaurants. There are so many rooms in this riad that you can sit in and relax/read. This riad is central to the marketplace and mosque. There is no need to drive, just walk and walk. My husband and I are thrilled to be here for three nights!!!! We ate a phenomenal breakfast by one of the pools. How would you like hot crepes with mushrooms and cheese? And of course the cappucinos we drank were superb! The boutique of the hotel is just lovely! This place has filled every nook and cranny with…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2016,5,Unparalleled,"We stayed here on two different occasions in 2016. The first time we had a suite which was so beautiful, with luxurious decor and design. It also came with our own private patio, The people at the front desk were so welcoming, as were the rest of the staff, from the dining room to the bar. We left for to days to visit Essouria and when we returned they greeted us as long lost friends and the bartender came up to our room to give us Tod bits to eat and a welcoming drink, and later, two roses. The breakfast was delicious and the and in a lovely setting by the pool. We wer very sorry that we only had a three night stay there. I highly recommend this hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Service is attentive and there is a lot of thought given to the small details . A 5 star experience.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2017,5,Great hotel,"La Maison Arabe was one of the most luxurious places we visited during our road trip in Morocco. If you don't wish to eat in one of the restaurants there (one with the pool is recommended), you can have a drink or a wine @ the jazz bar or in the open bar area, in case you are a smoker. Keep in mind that after 23:30 things cool down - it is a hotel after all -so get there promptly.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,All things Moroccan!!,"We loved this place so much!! It was authentic, beautiful, peaceful and romantic! The restaurants were all amazing and the staff was 5 star.

Although it's not attached to the hotel we didn't feel inconvenienced because once we got there it was like having our own private mansion with the most wonderful pool and food you could ask for! I would definitely stay here again!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2017,5,Wonderful and Fantastic,"We traveled with another couple and we spent three nights at La Maison Arabe. It was the highlight of our two weeks in Morocco. Several years ago it was listed by Conte Nast magazine as number 5 of the top 30 boutique hotels worldwide. La Maison Arabe is a world class hotel. The rooms are beautifully appointed, the beds comfortable and the heavy drapes allow you to sleep in. Each room has a balcony overlooking the beautiful garden, which is open to the sky but within the interior of the hotel. The hotel is filled with gorgeous paintings and Moroccan artifacts. You need to wander throughout the public areas of the hotel to find them. They should not be missed. The Moroccan lanterns by Yahya Creations must be seen to be believed. The staff cannot do enough to make your stay…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2017,5,An excellent Riad in Marrakech,"My husband and I had a short 4 night stay here at the beginning of March. Initially, I was a little concerned about staying in a smaller establishment, because we are both vegetarian & need a decent choice on the buffet breakfast table. No problem at all with that aspect of things here, and there's very little to add because everything about this riad was better than excellent. Staff, without exception, were wonderful and we took dinner in the restaurant one night. We aren't late eaters & we were the first customers when the restaurant opened at 7.00 pm but by the time we left at around 9.00pm there wasn't a spare table. I suspect some of the diners were non resident, so obviously La Maison Arabe has a good reputation for its cooking. We had suite 210 which was adjacent…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2017,5,A wonderful cooking class!,"Our cooking class began with our group sitting around the outdoor oven as typical Moroccan bread was prepared and baked. While the bread baked in the mud oven we were given a lesson on the proper preparation of mint tea. The still warm bread was passed around as we drank the just prepared tea. We could have eaten a the entire basket of the delicious bread! We were then directed to a covered outdoor table and we were told about how to season a tangine and about Moroccan cooking. We moved to the indoor cooking lesson kitchen which is set up for classes where each student has their own station complete with a sink, burnier and cutting board. All of the necessary ingredients and equipment was at each station and the instructors were at the front at a large station with a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2017,5,A fantastic stay,"We stayed at La Maison Arabe for six nights over the Easter period. As many have said what makes this hotel is the level of service from all staff. They go out of their way to help you and make sure you enjoy your stay. We ate at the restaurant by the pool a few times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food was of a very high standard. We stayed in Room 215 which although was a bit of climb it was worth it for the lovely room. The room had a small courtyard which was peaceful and not overlooked. We went to the country club a few times and the service we also received there from Mohammed and his team was again very good.

 April 2017,5,Authentic experience with bells and whistles,"La Maison Arabe is the place I look forward to returning on my next trip to Morocco.

We had our own private courtyard filled with green bushes and plants. the bedroom and bathroom - very spacious and luxurious. the breakfast served pool side- amazing! We loved the Jazz bar.

 April 2017,5,Blissful escape - sublime relaxation,"This hotel was unforgettable from the moment we got in touch to make a booking with them back in November 2016 for our Easter holidays this year. The e-mail service was outstanding, with quick and friendly responses to our queries concerning facilities, rooms, day trips and hammam. Our wishes were anticipated and the hotel was amazing, facilitating our transport to and from the airport as well as fast track process (highly recommended despite cost due to very busy airport!) through immigration. We were notified in advance that we were upgraded to Noor suite - a wonderful surprise.

Location is fantastic, the staff is amazing, the cooking school is state of the art, hammam is to die for, jazz bar is like something out of your favorite old romantic movie, and the rooms are beautiful. I felt so pampered while I stayed here. The staff at the hotel takes care of every little detail... from putting fresh flowers in your room, making sure that you have a bottle of water when you go out walking, and even giving me a cookbook from the cooking school when I checked out (so unexpected, I was very touched!).

 April 2017,5,Outstanding Boutique Riad but with Fabulous Amenities of Larger Hotels,"My family of four stayed in their 2 bedroom triplex which was outstanding. There was ample sitting areas and also a separate private rooftop space with lounging areas and a hot tub. The room was truly amazing and luxurious, with a very comfortable Moroccan decor. In walking around the riad you'd think it was a small place but it had a decent pool and different sitting corners and dining options.

We made a Moroccan tomato and pepper salad, an eggplant, tomato , garlic salad, chicken tagine with preserved lemons and olives and we shown how to prepare Milk Pastilla for desert.

I have enjoyed it so much that I almost don't want to rate and recommend it as highly as I am about to, for fear that it will no longer be such a hidden gem. In the run-up to arrival the team at the hotel were incredibly helpful in arranging (and moving on multiple occasions) bookings for the Spa and the two restaurants at the hotel. Each time I replied by email I was met with the same incredibly helpful response from Mostafa and the rest of the team.

Country club impressive with friendly staff and fabulous lunch menu, the salad dressings are amazing. Our room was sumptuous with an amazingly comfortable bed, kept incredibly clean and well kept, mini bar prices are the same as the bar. You do have to pay to use the coffee machine in the room, take your own nespresso pods! Didn't use the spa this time as we tried a close by nice local one.

First at all needs to be mentioned the service: you feel after few hours already as being part of a family. Maybe is the size of the hotel, definitely is also the character of the locals, very open and helpful. Definitely this place is unique. We stayed in many, many hotels world-wide and we need to recognise that this one was an experience on his own.

 April 2017,5,A delightful Marrakech experience.,"We recently spent four nights at this hotel and from the moment we arrived every member of staff was courteous , well mannered and very efficient. We stayed in Room 220 which had the benefit of a small but very private courtyard which was extremely useful if we decided at the end of a days sightseeing to enjoy a private supper by candlelight. One of the reasons we selected this hotel was the advertised cookery school . We naturally anticipated a higher level of cuisine . This , however , turned out to be a short demonstration in preparing a tagine. Having said that the food , which we enjoyed around the main pool was quite adequate. This is a splendid establishment in a perfect location for exploring the old town and we have every intention of returning.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2016,5,A great Location to spend Christmas,This was a perfect location from which to explore the city. Rarely have I experienced such genuinely pleasant staff. The room was beautiful.

You feel like you are back in the days of the Arabian nights. I believe that the hotel is made up of numerous old houses so there are lots of stairs that you have to climb to get to the breakfast room, tearoom, baths and in our case, to our room. The hotel has several lovely courtyards and our room had a private courtyard. Our room was spacious with a desk, a nice sized tv, a large closet with safe, a comfortable bed, an extra sitting chair.

 February 2017,5,Lovely lovely lovely hotel,"For a five day visit to Marrakesh with a friend we could not have picked a finer hotel. With 26 rooms, spa, pool and two restaurants plus a fine jazz bar where you can also eat this is a great choice for everyone. The hotel is furnished with more classical Moroccan art and furniture with lots of nooks and crannies to spend a few quiet moments should you need them. The entire team; restaurant, reception, concierge, bar and spa are completely focused on making your visit the best possible. After a night of sickness my friend was offered a special ginger tea to help her recover and the staff continued to ask her how she was feeling the following day. We enlisted the concierges help in arranging all our excursions (3 hour guided walk, carriage ride, cookery lesson, balloon trip,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2017,5,"Great staff, beautiful accomodations",We stayed at La Maison Arabe in February 2017 and had a wonderful time. The staff is friendly and helpful and eager to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The jazz bar is a great place to hear live music and have a drink before or after dinner and the international restaurant has a wide variety of food that is all delicious. The rooms were large and clean. We also attended a cooking class at the cooking school attached to the hotel which was wonderful.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2017,5,Being Home in Marrakech,"I'm not sure where to begin with La Maison Arabe (LMA). From the moment you walk in the door you're greeted with someone who already knows your name, a 5 minute check-in process which happens while seated on sofas over a drink and then a tour of the property (which is very helpful as the hotel is a beautiful maze) before settling in the room. It was an excellent and efficient process. Food, room, people - everything is terrific - nothing more I can really say. But perhaps the experience best summed up in one encounter. We enlisted the help of the most kind and helpful concierge (front desk agent - I'm so sorry to have forgotten his name) who guided us through the many options and places to visit and then, after sending us off to dinner for a couple hours, explained how…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2017,5,"Elegance, romantic hotel beyond 5 stars","I chose the hotel based on the TripAdvisor review that has a good spa and cooking course. All the staff is very professional, polite and helpful.The room is perfect, they upgraded me to a better room on second floor with a view of swimming pool. The hotel is full of history, the owner's collection of painting, art filled in the hotel, restaurants and plenty of roses and candles. They have a jazz bar I thought I was in the Casablanca movie. A lot of couples and families visiting for the Valentine's weekend. This hotel is a hidden treasure, if you want to surprise your girlfriend, it work very well. I shall be back again soon!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2017,5,Beautiful Restaurant,We visited here on our first night in Marrakesh and what a perfect introduction to Moroccan cuisine ! Amazing food & really welcoming attentive staff ! Beautiful setting & ambiance - would highly recommend !,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2017,5,Stunning hotel,"One of the finest hotels I've ever stayed in. Started as a restaurant in 1946 by two French ladies, it now has 26 suites, two restaurants and a cooking school. Exceptional service, friendly and very helpful staff, and attention to the finest details like presenting you with a file-out immigration departure card at checkout. Freshly-baked Moroccan breads for breakfast every morning and complementary tea and coffee in the afternoons served anywhere in the hotel. It's close to the main square and souks. And I love the Moroccan decor with rugs covering all the floor space. The hotel cookbook as a present was a very nice gesture indeed.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2016,5,Unique,"This is a truly beautiful, unique hotel almost right in the heart of Marrakech. Its the sort of place we don't want to leave. So luxurious. The food was outstanding and so was the service. We took the cookery course which was great fun and taught us the basics of Moroccan cooking. We will return.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2017,5,The nicest place I've ever stayed in,"My recent stay in La Maison Arabe was nothing short of breathtaking. From the very first minute we fell in love with the place. My girlfriend and I stayed for one night and we were treated like royalty by all the staff. They are extremely helpful and go above and beyond to make sure every little detail is perfect. Our room was spectacular and comfortable. The place is even more beautiful than you can see in the photos. I would highly recommend staying here. There are hundreds of Riads in Marrakech but I cannot stress how nice La Maison Arabe is. It is definitely worth paying a little bit more than others. If you have time make sure to get a Hammam while you're here, they are incredible. We will certainly be back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2017,5,Definitely one to return to!,"We have just returned from a short break in Marrakech and spent three nights in this delightful Riad. Would have loved to have stayed longer. There is little I can add to previous reports. The hotel itself is exquisite, the decor tasteful and the staff could not do more to help. All of this is done in a very understated, natural fashion and with a warm smile. It does appear that the staff love their work and their efforts are genuine. We enjoyed the 3hour cookery school class, where we met a lovely french couple. The class was conducted in both french and english - which if anything added to the experience - in a very advanced and well thought out cookery school. It definitely gives the Waitrose school of cookery in London a run for its money! Congratulations La…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,A first class experience,Just walking around La Maison Arabe is an experience in itself. The hotel is arranged around courtyards with public rooms around every corner. The decor is breath-taking. The restaurants are excellent. The suite we stayed in was beautifully decorated and tended to attentively. The staff is plentiful and gracious at all times. The spa where I had a hamam treatment felt like I are in another world altogether!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Amazing Marrakech,"We had a very special experience in La Maison Arabe which enhanced our overall experience of Marrakech. The minute we arrived the service levels were superb, from the pick up at the airport from Abdellah to the lovely greeting at the front desk from Nourredine. The hotel itself is a beautiful Riad, we were upgraded to a deluxe suite which was very spacious and exquisitely laid out. We ate out on a couple of occassions but the food could not compare to the in house restaurant Les Trois Saveurs. We ate here twice and on both occasions the food was superb. The restaurant has a beautiful poolside location and it is where they also serve breakfast. Our favourites were the Lamb couscous, Fish Tagine and the Morrocan Pancakes at breakfast with a honey and almond paste. The service at…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Why La Maison Arabe deserves its high ratings,"I must start by saying that I have been to La Maison Arabe a number of times now but I wanted to give you an idea of what it is that keeps me coming back. First of all, it is a gorgeous place to be, both visually and in the olfactory sense. The quality of the rooms is excellent, with beautiful furnishings, ornaments and artwork in every room and the public areas are charming, with a very warm swimming pool at the moment and an absolutely beautiful hammam and spa with fantastic people looking after you and highly skilful staff. It has absolutely excellent wifi everywhere and the usual business facilities. Both restaurants are excellent, in terms of food and the setting of the Trois Saveurs by the pool is beautiful both at breakfast and for dinner. In short, it is a lovely place…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,A must for any Tagine lover.....,"I have been here twice, once dinner in the courtyard and the other inside, both times absolutely fantastic - the lamb tagine is divine, staff are fantastic and atmosphere is great....this place has an amazing history, it's the oldest Riad in Marrakesh, it was Winston Churchill's favourite place eat. It's down a little alley way from the main road, so don't be alarmed. It's best to get your pick up sorted as the taxi drivers will try and charge you an arm and a leg to get home. The courtyard is best when the weather is hot but inside is best when it's cold, and it does get cold in January.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Dinner,"The entrance to the restaurant isn't what I'd expected when we arrived. It wasn't like we were able to get out of the car and step into the establishment. Once inside it was authentic Moroccan setting. Staff were dressed in Moroccan dress and Moroccan music was playing. There was a relaxed sense about the place that even if one arrived feeling stressed, it would melt their stresses away. The food is amazing.... the taste is awesome and the tenderness of the dish was perfect. I can't fault anything about my diner experience at La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Amazing Riad,"One of the best hotels I stayed at. Impeccable service, great facilities and perfect location near the square. Did I mention the service?

There is live music w oud and string guitar in an outdoor setting by a pool surrounded w olive and other local trees. We were taken there as guests of a high ranking local person. We had different varieties of food such as veggies, pumpkin and orange soup, slow cooked lamb, couscous among others. All three couples loves the food.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Exceeded expectations,My husband and I just spent 6 days at this wonderful hotel. Our room was exceptional with beautiful decor. The ambience in the hotel was lovely. I done a cooking class and it was very knowledgeable and the host was excellent. The staff go above and beyond to make the stay as best as possible they were all very friendly and we did not have any complaints during our stay. We also had a hammam and massage at the spa which we highly recommend. I also had a facial and manicure and pedicure.The staff in the spa seemed very knowledgeable too and were very respectful.The location was ideal for the souks and shopping centers. I would definitely be going back to this exemplary hotel and will be recommending it to family and friends.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Cooking class!,"Me and my wife attending the cooking class here today and it is one of the highlights of our holiday. The host Wafa is very knowledgeable and very friendly. We started off with learning to make Moroccan mint tea, we were then told the history around the food and spices, where they came from and how they are used. We visited a local bakery and then returned to cook our food including Moroccan salad and chicken tagine. The quality and cleanliness of the kitchen is at the top, as is the quality of ingredients used. Once we had cooked our food we endjoyed them on the terrace and where then given brilliant gifts from the staff on oir departure. This class was money well spent and we wont forget it! I recommend to everyone.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 January 2017,5,Understated Elegance - Full Debrief,"Just home after 5 days here (mid-Jan). I have been thinking about how to provide the most helpful and informational review of La Mason Arabe - something that didn’t replicate everyone else’s “oasis in the medina”, vague (but great) accolades. Because there are so many riads and resorts in Marrakech from which to choose. I was completely overwhelmed with the choices as I suspect, many are. I ultimately, went with La Maison Arabe because a few years back, we had put a small group of media VIPs into the property, and they raved. So, here goes… 1. Location - easier than many riads in terms of access. No circuitous little alleys to navigate. Main road just down a little alleyway, where the entrance is situated. Suggest you have hotel arrange for airport pick-up - nicer…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Service like you have always wanted,"The service is simply exemplary. Not intrusive but if you raise your eyes for something you need, bang they are there with what you want when you want it. The property is very well done an the level of cleanliness and maintenance exceptional. Furniture and decor touches are also well-considered and of high quality. Restaurant fantastic - wine selection great. The staff are multi-lingual, cute and fun.. The jazz bar is a hoot, fantastic bar staff and a great fun pianist. We had a lot of fun in there. Location is great and an easy walk to the souks. The history of the property is fascinating being one of the first if not the first riyad and foreign operated restaurant behind the ramparts in the old city. The attached cooking school is also worth a try. I can only recommend it as…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 January 2017,5,Arab Hospitality at its Finest.,"Bottom Line Up Front - Overall, one of the best hotel experiences of my life. I am a very fussy person - I can complain about almost anything. This place is absolutely flawless - stay here! To go into more detail, I had booked another hotel in Marrakech (the top rated riad on tripadvisor) and they cancelled my reservation only a few weeks before the trip. They suggested I try La Maison Arabe, and I am so thoroughly delighted they did because I think it turned out to be much, much, much better! I will go through all of the highlights point by point: - Airport pick-up. The price was right, the driver spoke English and was so welcoming. Definitely worth it to avoid the typical airport hassle. - So intimate. I was concerned that it might be too large - 26 rooms as opposed…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Traditonal excellence in service is never outdated,"We travelled to Marrakech for a mid Winter break in the first week of January. We chose to stay at La Maison Arabe on the recommendation of friends. We expected a nice small hotel in the Medina, but we were taken aback at the excellence of the service and the quality of all aspects of La Maison. From the moment we arrived until we left, we were cared for by the dedicated team at La Maison Arabe. We loved our room overlooking the pool and courtyard restaurant. We enjoyed the Jazz Bar for relaxation. The food in both the traditional Moroccan restaurant and the contemporary courtyard restaurant was excellent. The hotel desk arranged a tour guide to the Medina. It was the best way to be introduced to the Souks, which are daunting for first timers. The highlight of our visit was…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,cooking classes,"Enjoy the art of cooking classes with a well known chef of the hotel, tea ceremony and enjoy your meal with high quality beverages, it was an excellent experience, totally recommended to go alone or in a group, if you enjoy food and cooking this is a must do",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2016,5,"Exceptional experience, can't go wrong with this place","My wife and I found La Maison Arabe on Tripadvisor while planning our three day visit to Morocco from the United States. Not knowing much about Mororcco, we were a bit nervous about picking a place just based on Tripadvisor ratings. I must say that we couldn't have picked anything better than this hotel. It was truly exceptional. I've traveled extensively and have been SPG Platinum for several years. No hotel I've ever stayed at compares to the authenticity, hospitality, comfort and aesthetic sense of this place. They make you feel as if the entire staff is just dedicated to you and it takes your mind to a different place. I would stay here again without hesitation and strongly recommend La Maison Arabe to anyone looking for a true getaway in Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Amazing Place and Staff,"This is an extraordinarily beautiful and charming hotel. Amazingly kind, welcoming and helpful staff. This hotel is a hidden treasure in the Medina. This exceptionally unique and beautiful hotel is highly recommended without any reservations.

Make sure you try the magic and superb herbal local and fresh teas that Brahem prepares in the morning.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Simply terrific!,"We stayed at the Maison Arabe for 6 nights at the start of January 2017 and it was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had (and we travel a lot). The building itself is beautiful -- especially the breakfast area around the pool. The food was great. Our room was really nice -- spacious, well equipped, quiet, and clean. But above all, the staff were fantastic. Always polite, helpful, and friendly -- every one of them. We had bad colds during our stay (my wife in particular had a really nasty and pervasive cough) and the front office kept offering ""special"" hot drinks with mint, lime juice, cinnamon and ginger to help her, and were always asking how she was doing. We were both so impressed with the care and attention. While we were happy to finally be heading home to…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Impeccable service,"Wow! Thats what I can say about this place. The service, the ambiance and location is the reason I gave 5 out of 5. First the service is outstanding! They remember every guests name and make you feel very welcomed. We arrived very early for check in and besides just taking our bags they sat us down for breakfast. (The breaky is fantastic as well). The hotel is beautifully decorated and the two restaurants and jazz bar are great with good food and musicians. (Didnt use the spa but it looks pretty) We were upgraded from a normal room to a junior suite. The room was spacious and bed was comfortable. It is close to the medina which is where you want to be.

 January 2017,5,Absolutely wonderful!,"La Maison Arabe is a place of calm and serenity in the middle of the frenetic city of Marrakech. Behind the entrance which cannot be found easily along a back street you would never think of going down unless you knew where this hotel was you get everything you could possibly wish for with fantastic staff and a great setting for your stay in the city.You are important from the moment you walk in to the minute you leave and possibly after. The rooms are well proportioned with balconies overlooking the central courtyard and small swimming pool. The food is varied and typical of a hotel of this high standard but of course this is reflected in the price. The hammam & spa is excellent and just what a weary traveler needs when in Marrakech. If you want the best then this is it, you…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2016,5,A love story,"This place is amazing and simply a love story from the moment you enter the hotel, walking thru the ally, looking at the super arts on the walls to the the super friendly stuff.

 January 2017,5,Awesone Service,"Rarely does one find such a well managed hotel. The staff is really well trained, very kind, attentive but not overbearing. The premises have a beautiful aesthetic touch, probably also thanks to Italian prince that owns the hotel. Location is practical for reaching both the old and new town. Overall we highly recommend it",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Morocco Adventure,"The staff at the hotel could not have been kinder or more helpful. We were greeted with refreshments and cookies, taken to our rooms which far exceeded our expectations. Our sons backpack broke right before he had to leave for the airport and they sent someone from the hotel with the backpack to a nearby tailor to have it repaired at no cost to us! Additionally they did an excellent job setting us up with a tour guide to the Atlas Mountains and had a staff member walk us to our restaurant reservations as it is easy to get lost in the narrow alleys. This was a memorable trip for many reasons, but staying at such a luxurious and well staffed hotel made a great trip even better.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Maison ADORABLE,This is hands down one of the nicest hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. From start to finish the experience was just fantastic. After a day in the souks it was a little cocoon amidst the hussle and bussle of the Medina. After a trip down the coast of Morocco I stayed in La Maison Arabe with some friends for a weekend while we explored the wonders of Marrakesh. The HOTEL BUILDING itself was just beautiful... the photos on the website honestly do not do it justice. The mix of old world and new design works so well... its so perfectly cosy in every way. Its also perfectly located close to the Medina and just a short hop to the airport (only 70 MAD in a street taxi). The FOOD is second to none. We were lucky enough to eat in both Le Restaurant and Les Trois…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Storybook hotel,"This hotel is out of a storybook. Pictures don't do it justice. It feels very old world classy. From the decor to the staff, you feel like you are in a traditional Moroccan Riad for sure. It is about a 10 minute walk to Jamaa El Fena square and 15 minute walk to Gueliz. The restaurants are five star as well. I highly recommend the beef fillet at the international restaurant. The Moroccan restaurant is one of the best in town and very romantic. We took cooking classes on the property as well and that was truly a cut above the rest. We got to eat our own cooking on the top of the hotel after we were done. We also had a patio in our room overlooking the square. The rooms are charming and they use keys instead of keycards to get in the room. Breakfast buffet was also great!…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Gorgeous dinner,"We were recommended this place and made sure we booked a table in advance as we had heard it was popular. I am so glad that we did as the food , service , and environment were superb .

Well worth a visit and we also bought a CD from the Oud / guitar duo .",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Dinner,Went here for dinner - beautiful hotel tucked down a small street. Dined by a pool that was surrounded by candles. Extremely high quality food and service. Staff very attentive and efficient without being fussy. Food choice was an excellent array of Moroccan dishes fabulously presented. A trip here is a must. I bet the rest of the hotel is equally good.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Lovely restaurant,"We were staying about 20 minutes walk from here but it had been recommended so we were determined to experience it and we were glad we made the effort. A lovely cocktail in the bar before hand we were then led to the twinkling fairy lights round a pool for a delicious dinner. It was very busy, with a nice atmosphere. Service was prompt (unusually) and the traditional dishes (tagine and Moroccan salad) fared well with my international dish of steak. The inside restaurant serves only Moroccan fare.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,ten star riad,"I don't think La Maison Arabe needs any more 5 star reviews... ... so I'll give it 10. We had to book a different riad over New Year. (Very few rooms left at this time of year, so take note!) This first place was dingy and unloved and we were so happy to find ourselves staying, for our last two nights in this beautiful hotel, hidden in an alleyway in the heart of the town. The food was delicious; both dinner and breakfast, plenty of choice; no need to go further afield for meals. Now my husband is urging me to make the lamb dish he loved, (slow cooked with preserved lemons in a clay pot,) and the freshly cooked Morrocan breakfast pancakes, served with butter and honey. The live oud and guitar music at dinner time was wonderful. Icing on the cake. The room we were given, (215…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 December 2016,5,Moroccan hospitality at its best,"From the warmth of our welcome to the unassuming but genuine goodwill and helpfulness of every single member of staff made us feel extremely relaxed and well looked after. This was well matched by the ambience and excellence of the services and facilities available. There is a beautiful courtyard with well decorated interior and the unbelievably well heated swimming pool offers a suitable focus to the restaurant/outdoor breakfast area. The Spa area looks idyllic and includes a Hammam. There are two restaurants - one surrounding the pool offers international cuisine and the second in another area of the hotel concentrates on Moroccan cuisine. Needless to say the meals we had were excellent and every breakfast time was most enjoyable, with very personal attentive service and staff…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,5,Excellent hotel and location,"Good food, nice SPA-wonderful introduction to the hamam-perfect location. We even explored the ""country club"" property they own. Highly recommend for a great visit to Marrakech. Eat at their Moroccan restaurant and visit the jazz piano bar.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2017,4,Hotel is a little tired and needs some management help but the spa is exceptional,"We went to the hotel the day before we had a spa/hammam booked and had also two nights on hold for a few days ahead. We were guided to the outside terrace which is unremarkable - perhaps uninspired is better - and the service modest at best. Much of the hotel shows clear signs of a glamorous past and a truly charming space but with worn seats, red almost shag carpet runners on the stairs and other tell tale signs that a little upgrade ought to be in the works. Also the staff while very friendly and charming are suffering from neglect of management in my opinion. While we were on the terrace we say many guests simply waiting to be served without any success in an otherwise empty vacant terrace area with plastic chairs. We decided at the moment not to keep our booking for the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 December 2016,5,Superbe dinner in Marrakech!,"I have just a word.. WOW! As soon as you enter inside you can feel how magic a place in Marrakech can be despite the external appereance. The restaurant is fantastic, the location is wonderful... ask for a table around the small pool and relax hearing the soft moroccan live music. The food is something special as the standing service. The price is a bit high but totally justified by the high quality of food and standard of both service and location. It was a pity to not stay in the hotel too.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2016,5,Fantastic. Highly memorable stay.,The look and the feel of La Maison Arabe was absolutely high quality.

 December 2016,5,Unforgettable Birthday,"My wife and I stayed four nights at La Maison Arabe. It was the most memorable stay of our ten days trip to Morocco. The Riad/Hotel is a real gem in the old Medina. The high taste can be witnessed in details at the public areas, restaurants, rooms, in everywhere. Atmosphere reflecting (without exaggerating) the culture, lighting, heating, artworks, amenities, comfort of the room and bed were superb. The variety and taste of food (hot and cold) at the breakfast buffet were good. The hammam, spa facilities were tastefully decorated. We took 90 min. Royal Session. It was divine.

The prices to eat and stay here were quite reasonable. The location is at the entrance of the medina. If you need to park, there is parking nearby.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Amazing place where all will be taken care of,"We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids aged 6 and 9) and spent 5 days in Marrakech at La Maison Arabe. The hotel service was top notch. We arrived early in the morning and were immediately taken to breakfast (which is excellent) and then allowed very early into our room. The staff gave us great recommendations and booked transport to and from the airport, a medina guide and made dinner reservations. We were departing earlier than they opened the breakfast service so had it delivered to the room at no cost. The location is great ... easy for touring the Medina. The food in the Moroccan restaurant was delicious and very good quality. The breakfast was really good with fresh omelets, crepes and various fresh juices. Our kids loved it too especially the Moroccan food and savory…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Charming first class experience in the Medina,"After lots of research, we settled on this property and it did not disappoint. Completely charming, romantic, historic, clean and impressive at every turn. Tucked away on a quiet little street. The staff could not do enough to help us. We got double upgraded to this amazing suite overlooking the courtyard and pool. The atmosphere in the hotel is so charming and tasteful throughout. Every luxury amenity you could want. We tried the Hamam one day and and a great experience. Did the cooking school one day and LOVED it. Organized, authentic and fun! Would definitely stay again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2016,4,Fantastisk,"An amazing visit - the service was excellent, the hotel is beautiful and very clean and is perfectly situated to visit the souks in the medina or take a trip to the new town. It is definitely worth taking advantage of the hamam facilities. Would also recommend eating at one of the hotel's restaurants where the food is delicious and the setting on the terrace near the pool is magical.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Delightful hotel with amazing staff and service,"My husband and I spent a week in this gorgeous little hotel. We lucked out and got upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival. The room interiors were beautiful and everything was kept spotless. The decor and lighting around the hotel were very tastefully done and we were always happy to hang around leisurely by the pool area after breakfast and also in the courtyard for afternoon mint tea. We fell in love with Marrakech on this trip and its people. Much of this was influenced by the attentive service and genuine friendliness and warmth of the staff at La Maison Arabe. They took exceptional care of us and we enjoyed chatting with them and being welcomed by their smiling faces throughout the hotel. My husband loves labneh, and even though this is not a traditional dish in Morocco,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Romantic Riad/Hotel in the Medina of Marrakesch,"My wife and I love the romantic atmosphere of this riad in the centre of Marrakesch. In short walking distance you'll finde the souks and other attractions. Beside some trips we also loved to stay and just relax at the hotel. We enjoyed the local food and very pleasant service. The staff is very friendly and also eager to fulfil any wish you have. The breakfast buffet is good (in terms of high standards), both hotel restaurants were good and fair in their pricing. We definitely will come back again and recommend it to our family & friends.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Beautiful and great location,"We stayed two nights at la Maison arabe! It's a beautiful place! Fire place early morning in all the lobbies! Mint tea in the afternoon! Great Restraunt! Great room, excellent bed!!! Room service delicious!! They do everything for you! The attention to detail is phenomenal!!! Beautiful place and everyone working there is so nice! They made our visit to marrakesh very comfortable!!! Thank you",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Pleasant mix of Riad and Hotel,"We've stayed in a few places in Marrakech. We'd dined here before and enjoyed it so on returning stayed for just one night. It's a lovely place that balances the warmth or a Riad with the facilities of a hotel. The service is top notch. This is common in most Marrakech, higher end riads but Aribe is no different. The rooms are very cute, finished to a very high standard and comfortable. The location is good. We also stayed in Riad Kinza which is quite close but and found Aribe worth the extra cost. The restaurant has the most wonderful ambiance. Truly stunning. Oddly the food we've eaten here was nothing special. We tend to stick with the Moroccan dishes. Maybe we'll try the European ones next time. Would definitely go back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,1 year anniversary,The hotel is so lovely. The staff were very sweet and welcoming. Our favorite part was the breakfast. There is a awesome lady who makes yogurt and bread every morning. It's delicious! One of the staff made yogurt with all his favorite toppings...it was the best yogurt I ever had in my life! Since all the food is halal- as in we could even eat sausages! It was heavenly and they make you feel like king and Queens at breakfast. The fresh roses in the room smell heavenly. I have never smelt roses like that in the US. They also have a gift shop where they sell organic Aragan oil. They will give a set price and it's better to buy from there instead of the street markets as they might not be selling you the real stuff. P.S. The welcome mint drink is delicious!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Paradise in the middle of bustling Marrakech,We had a lovely stay at La Maison Arabe. I mistakenly booked the wrong dates and notified the hotel. They were so gracious and understanding. The accommodated my mistake and were very communicative. For our stay: from the moment we walked in the front door through the team finding us a ride to the airport we were taken care of as though we were VIP guests. The welcome drink was delicious and refreshing - it was the perfect way for us to settle in. We then went on a very thorough tour of of the property - there are so many wonderful nooks and crannies and things to take advantage of at the property. Our room was beautiful - it had a patio that overlooked the pool and was very spacious. The room was filled with beautiful flowers and the amenities were wonderful. We…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 November 2016,5,Charming hotel with great service and lovely rooms,"I really enjoyed my three day stay in La Maison Arabe. The hotel is a charming old hotel in the medina. My suite was spacious and very comfortable and the service was wonderful. The hotel is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle to find your way around (I kept taking wrong turns and stairs to get to my room and other parts of the hotel, but always found everything!). It has two terrific restaurants, once with Moroccan cuisine and the other with French & Thai cuisine. My meals at both were great. The spa was a great surprise. On my first days there I had a harmman with the classic steam bath and scrub and then a massage. It was so relaxing and the spa is beautiful and peaceful with interesting moroccan design. It is underground so you feel like you are in a special cave of…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,"Treated as a sultan, in an ambiance of a fairy tail","The warm welcome we received continued during our stay. Everything was superb. The atmosphere, the interior, the beautiful Moroccan styled interior, the staff, the food. We loved the location in the heart of the medina, a quiet oasis in the hectic neighbourhood, except for the prayer announcements of the mosque close by. You could not miss those. We also attended a cooking class. In an adjacent building, specially designed for cooking classes, we were welcomed with an inspiring story about the history of La Maison Arrab and that we would share the love of food together in spite of the different views and cultures all participents of the cookclass had. It is an experience I would recommend anybody who will go to Marrakesh, in fact it is worth the visit of this special city.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Last Meal in Morocco,"This was our last meal in Morocco and we are so happy to end on this note! Everything was phenomenal and it is a gorgeous property. It really did not feel like we were in the medina but in an oasis of calm. The food was delicious and the service top notch- we did not have any issues with service like some other reviewers. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and professional without being neglectful. I would definitely recommend anyone wanting a fabulous meal in Marrakech to come here.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,1001 nights in Marrakesh,"It is an unexpectly excellent hotel in a city in Africa, which is not everywhere nice. For Europeans it is an magic place, which is very unusual, but inviting. I could list that the staff is very kind, the restaurant is good, etc., but what I liked very much is the row of lapmps in the corridor to the pool and restaurant. It is so wonderful that you should see it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Great cooking experience!,"Excellent day with professional, knowledgeable and patient staff. Really great kitchen layout with well equipped work stations.

 November 2016,5,A special place in Marrakech,"A truly tranquil and special find recommended by friends who accompanied us. It was their second visit to La Maison Arabe. Staff were always courteous and attentive no matter what the ask or time of day. The hotel is a labyrinth of stairways and while taking some time to navigate it retains a special atmosphere. We took advantage of Hammam, cooking class and wellbeing services plus the evening restaurant. Highly recommend all.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Hammam par excellence,"Absolutely fabulous experience from the beautiful candle-encircled pool waiting area to the hammam experience to the first class massage. Staff was great especially considering there was a mix-up on my appointment time, but they graciously accommodated me anyway. A real highlight of our Marrakech trip!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2015,5,Cooking Lesson; Must DO!,"I spent some of the most valuable hours of my life doing the cooking class here. We were greeted with tea, and given a brief talk before being shown how to make flatbreads in the oven. We then ate the fresh breads, were shown how to make tea and then drunk the tea! After this we moved in the kitchen, which was high-tech beyond what I could have imagined. No sharing necessary, a complete workstation each with cameras,TVs and beautiful assistance whenever needed. We cooked a three course meal, which we then enjoyed outside together before being given a special gift upon leaving. Cannot recommend enough .",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,Delicious meal in a great location.,"We went to this restaurant on recommendations from other travel reviews and locals and the experience was very memorable. Authentic Moroccan decore and delicious traditional food, in particular the lamb tangier and the chicken targine. Desserts also good. Service was good and music pleasant and relaxing.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2016,5,The most beautiful place,"Lovely,clean,the best of Marrakesh.

 October 2016,5,Highlight of our trip,"We did the cookery workshop during the morning and enjoyed a Hammam in the Spa in the afternoon. Absolutely fabulous. So impressed with the kitchen and facilities. The Dada (chef), translators and assistants were all such lovely, professional women. We learned loads, had fun and then enjoyed our own cooking. Afterwards we received rewards and the most thoughtful gift (I wont say what it was to spoil the surprise for others). We then went to the Spa where my friend and I had a traditional Hammam - Saffa took care of us, I cannot rate her highly enough, she was courteous, efficient, professional and effective. I enjoyed every moment of the treatment and really found the relaxation area afterwards to be beautiful. I am sorry that I did not get the receptionist / managers name…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 October 2016,5,"if Magic had a home, it would be La Maison Arabe","It was not my first visit to La Maison Arabe, but it was my very first stay. I had fallen in love with the place after a visit with a friend 2 years ago, and since then, I have always dreamed of staying in this magical and peaceful, traditional, but yet very sophisticated Moroccan historical house. Our stay was beyond expectations, starting from the booking until the totally unexpected surprise of upgrading our initially boooked suite to The Presidential Suite, as a gift for our anniversary. The staff were just amazing. They think, in advance, of every little detail that can make your stay magical. We had a chance to use the SPA, which was an amazing experience. The restaurant Les Trois Saveurs was a total blast. We had 3 different meals, and they were all just…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Loved going to country club for the swimming pool. Totally recommend, no complaints.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Exotic place with great food and service,We arrived with no reservation but they graciously served us or meal at the hotel's jazz bar. Cuisine is awesome and we were even treated to free welcome drinks and dessert tray. A bit pricey but certainly to be expected for a classy place.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Great surprise,This is an extraordinary place in Marrakech. Beautiful ambiance with outstanding decoration. It is certainly an oasis in the middle of the desert. It's a must go restaurant. The food is excellent. We had Coeur de Filet de Boeuf which was just extraordinary with a great bottle of wine and vegetarian couscous for starters. Simply delightful.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Memorable and magical riad!,"Spent four nights in October as a single traveling with a small group of ten. Often times, rooms assigned to solo travelers do not receive the same attention to detail or luxury that larger rooms do. This is definitely not the case at La Maison Arabe. Loved the leather wrapped armoire with generous interior storage; the painted ceilings that defined the bed area; the atmospheric operable arched windows that lined one entire side of the room and the generous patio furnished with an alcoved banquette lined with pillows. Of course, the bed and linens were superior, the bathroom marbled and spotless. Imagine recessed lights set into recessed stars! This is the attention to detail that adds a special touch. Then imagine that ALL of the public spaces are wrapped in this kind…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Most Fabulous Riad!!!,"We stayed at La Maison Arabe for four days and absolutely loved it! The room, food, property and staff were all first class. The riad was in a great location and easy to walk everywhere. They arranged airport transfers and a tour of the city and a tour with driver up to the mountains -- all were excellent. The hotel staff could not have been more accommodating -- they arranged to have my husband's breakfast specially prepared and brought up to the room one morning when he was feeling jet lagged, they scheduled last minute spa treatments that went past the spa hours, they sent out for overnight repair a leather good we purchased but we realized needed to be fixed and they did so much more to make our stay relaxing and enjoyable. I can't wait to visit again and bring our entire…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Excellent service and experience,"We stayed for three nights in La Maison Arabe for a wedding anniversary. The whole experience of the hotel was very good. It is located in a small side street but close to all the main sites of the old city so we were able to walk everywhere. But once inside the doors from the busy city the hotel is an oasis of peace and tranquility. It is a beautifully individual hotel around two courtyards, with rooms reached by a whole variety of corridors and staircases - far removed from the identical corridors and rooms of most modern hotels. The public rooms were all beautifully decorated and there lots of nooks and crannies with sofas and chairs. Our room, a Junior Suite, was perfect - large and very comfortable and again very tastefully decorated in Moroccan style. We had a sitting room…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Faultless again!,"We returned here for a 3 day break. Time to relax at the country club, enjoy the hamam/ massage experience and of course visit the souks.

 October 2016,5,Fine dining,"If there had been one more day, we would definitely go there a second time because it was just that good. Little expensive but worth the money.

 October 2016,5,Excellent,"Pickup at the Airport was as expected. Nice clean car and polite driver. Reception simply perfect. All Papers filled out ready to sign. We also got a nice welcome drink and information about the hotel. After a short time personal knew your room and handed out the correct key. Papers to leave the country again where also handed out at the checkout. Hotel / Rooms are first of all nice and clean and very authentic arab stile. Simply romantic. The same thing goes for the restaurant. Brilliant atmosphere. The food with many arab dishes excellent cook and not to much adapted to world taste. But also standards as tenderloin and similar are on the card. The Service also excellent, kind and efficient. The Location in the middle of Marrakech is excellent. You can reach every point…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Exceptional service,We have travelled the world and work in the hotel business and have to say this is one of the best hotel experiences we have had. The suite was large and very comfortable. The Riad was beautiful and full of Moroccan art prices. Every nook and courtyard had beautiful sitting areas. The real standout was the service. The management and staff seemed to anticipate our needs before us asking and were constantly providing additional service items at no charge and doing whatever they could to ensure we were comfortable and happy. In a world where everything comes at a price we were pleasantly surprised and extremely appreciative of he service here. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect. We will be back!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Excellent choice,"The service was excellent. The staff was well trained, they answered whatever you asked, or they find out for you. Everybody was smiling, from the front desk to the restaurant waitress, service is amazing. The building was a Riad and then they built a new hotel, integrated by different levels and stairs. Every corner has been decorated with fine Morocco style pieces. The numbers of the suites are embroidered on the door, as well as the bed sheets, tablecloth and the like. The suite was simply extraordinary. You have a big bathroom, one space for the King Size bed and a living room, plus a terrace looking to the interior patio with the swimming pool and restaurant.

 October 2016,1,OVERRATED - BLING BLING BLING,"Had several dinners. Yes this place has a history......but......highly highly overrated. Bling bling bling............ Has nothing to do with the real Marocco and Marrakesh. Did not hear one word in french. Prices for rooms are much to high...200-800 € range.......superior?.......""yes, but there is a private jacuzi"".....what?.....for that price you can buy one at home..... Luxury PALACES in Marrakesh do NOT ask such prices for a private.. VILLA!....Low season in ""la maison arabe"" is only ONE ! month...!???......Dinner was not bad ....in the dark. Not a place to relax though with swimming pool downstairs between people having lunch or dining. So each time you are in the sun and wants a swimm....you have to come downstairs ?...... ""Yes.....but we have a property....that you can…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Fabulous,One of the best hotels! Impeccable service. The room was perfect. Same for the restaurant and the hammam must be experienced.

 October 2016,5,Excellent Stay,"We loved staying at La Maison Arabe it is in just the right location to access all the sites of Marrakesh. The staff are excellent, you could relax in the courtyard or enjoy a cocktail in the bar. We had dinner in the restaurant one evening and the setting next to the pool is just lovely. We would definitely recommend this as a excellent hotel choice.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Beyond beautiful,We were thrilled with the beauty and history of La Maison Arabe. The food was also wonderful and the staff was friendly and attentive. AC was very responsive which is very important in Morocco. Rose petals met us upon arrival. Fresh flowers in our room and throughout the Riad. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. I would return in a second. Don't miss out on experiencing this authentic Marrakech delight.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Famous Riad Is A Must,La Maison Arabe is in a great location and is a real gem to explore. The rooms are large with loads of closet space and a separate stall shower. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The restaurant has wonderful food and lovely music to enjoy. Breakfast on the terrace is a great way to start the day exploring the wonderful city of Marrakech. Would stay here again if I get lucky enough to visit again. Had a hamman in the spa which I loved. It was a delightful experience and very inexpensive. Did not get to take a cooking class but did buy the La Maison Arabe cookbook to bring home.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2016,5,Perfect in every way,We stayed at this hotel for a short break and I can honestly say it's one of the best hotels i have ever stayed. Room was fabulous.

 October 2016,5,It's all the little things!,"We wrapped up a month-long trip through Morocco with four nights in La Maison Arabe which just may be the best hotel we have ever experienced. The service alone is unsurpassed. Examples include the invisible, silent housekeeping ; the waitstaff which, seemingly by osmosis, knew to bring an extra cushion for back support; the attentiveness of Christophe, the restaurant manager ; Adil and company at the front desk, whose assistance, every day, was offered with genuine pleasure; and the unexpected upgrade at check-in. Then there's the excellent location, the restaurants, the architecture and décor, the small, intimate and private feel of the place and the fact that the dress is low-key, casual and comfortable. We stayed in Room 7 , a suite, which although it had no balcony,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2016,5,Incredible Restaurant,"This was recommended to us by our hotel and the reviews on Trip Advisor certainly backed up the recommendation. We enjoyed our first meal here so much that we came back for a second time and the staff remembered us and we were warmly welcomed back, they could even remember what drinks we had previously had. The attention to detail to here is second to none. Its not a cheap meal out, but well worth the money spent, our meal with drinks before hand, wine and 2 courses was approx £140. My only regret, not arranging to have stayed here and to have enjoyed the hotel aspect too, which I'm sure would be just as superb.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2016,5,Splendid experience,My friend i had lunch at maison arabe. We chose it because it was well rated on trip advisor. It was a bit hard to localise at first we had to park far away.. but once we found it Oh God it was soo worth the effort! The service is amazing and the staff is so nice and friendly. There'snt a large choice on the menu but the courses we tried were so exquisite. It's so calme and peaceful. We had a great afternoon. It is now one of my favourite spots on marrakech. The prices are a bit high. But i mostly recommand the place for special ans intimate occasions.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2016,5,Felt like an Arabian princess,"We visited la Maison Arabe for a long weekend to celebrate my special birthday. And what an amazing way to do so. From be moment you walk into this Riad you're being treated like royalty. All staff incredibly helpful, considerate and well informed.

Only a stone's throw from the hustle and bustle of the medina, a true pearl in Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2016,5,Incredible,"Not sure you can compare this because we had a suite - 3 floors -first floor was a living room, 2 nod floor was the main bedroom and the 3rd floor was an outside patio with a jacuzzi - just incredible what a beautiful place. I want to live here - everyone is very friendly and helpful - I totally recommend this place",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2016,5,Enchanting Riad,"This is one of the best places I have stayed. The position is very special within the Medina. The rooms are very comfortable especially in the old part, but with all the mod cons you need.

The kitchen is very good and the night setting by the pool is magical. A wonderful place from which to enjoy Marrekech. Additionally, the riad has an ""oasis"", 15 minutes by riad shuttle car, where you can escape the caotic pace of the Medina. Lovely gardens, another good kitchen and a lovely pool. Staff here also willing to assist in whatever way asked. When back in Marrakech we will stay at this peaceful riad again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2016,5,personalized service executed flawlessly,"We spent three nights at La Maison Arabe during our honeymoon in Morocco. Given that the property has less than 30 rooms, the personalization of service was impeccable and every request, small or large, was welcomed with delight and executed efficiently. We were upgraded to a beautiful room with a terrace overlooking the pool and restaurant. The rooms are spacious and luxurious with traditional moroccan elements. We loved the hotel so much, that we dined in for every meal: whether it was breakfast in the room, lunch in the courtyard or dinner at the restaurant, every meal was a delight.

 September 2016,5,My second cooking class,"Ok...everytime I step foot in Marrakech, I will take a cooking class at La Maison Arabe. This was my second visit and second class. The class venue, recipes given for the class, certificate of completion...all perfect touches and upgraded...as if it could get any better. As a culture-holic, I loved (and appreciated) the historical introduction given by Wafaa Amagui. International cuisine is truly a great way to understand a country and culture. Now I can share my learned recipes with friends back home in New York. Next time, I will plan ahead so I can take more than one class. Bravo to the team who have put together a perfect and well thought out product! Ohh..seperate alert...if you buy a tangine you must place it in your check-in luggage. Airport security will not…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2016,5,"I will always stay here, an amazing place","Unparalleled service, gorgeous property, delicious restaurant, luxurious spa. We were upgraded to a more spacious room upon arrival. The manager and the staff of the hotel are so accommodating, you want for nothing. I cannot say enough good things about how helpful the manager (Andil sp?) was. He arranged for a great guide through the medina at a reasonable price, got us our train tickets to fes, booked reservations for dinner at great restaurants and even swapped certain spa treatments that came with our hotel package when one of our group said she didnt like the one that was included.

 May 2016,5,"Beautiful property, excellent food, wonderful staff","We had such a wonderful time while we were in Marrakech and La Maison Arabe was definitely one of the reasons why. It is a beautiful property with 2 restaurants, a bar/lounge, a spa/hammam and a pool (though you can't really go swimming in it -- it's more like a lap pool and all the people eating are surrounding the pool, so it would be a bit odd). The staff was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable -- they would hail us taxis and negotiate with the drivers for us. One night, we were lost getting to a restaurant and they came and walked us there -- that is above and beyond service! The food at the restaurants was excellent. We had dinner there 3 times and breakfast every day. A huge thank you to La Maison Arabe for making a special trip even more so. If anyone in your…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

In the big courtyard is a pool, where around also the breakfast is served. In the evening nice not to loud live music.

This was a first visit to Morrocco and the staff took care of us--from arranging guides and drivers to suggesting and confirming restaurant reservations. I highly recommend the cooking school, which is the best one in the world that I have attended. The spa is also world class. All of this is located in a hotel that feels small enough to be intimate. It is right in the medina and close to everything. I would definitely stay here again on our next trip.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 August 2016,5,Outstanding!,"Having had such a great experience at La Maison Arabe last October, my wife, son and I decided to visit again in August 2016. Based on our previous stay, we arrived with great expectations and we weren't disappointed, from the first moment we stepped back inside LMA, being greeted like old friends/family, to our departure. A free room upgrade was an unexpected bonus, but as with our first visit, it was the attention to detail and consistently outstanding customer service that makes LMA stand out from all other hotels we have stayed in. Never have we felt so at home in somewhere other than our own home. We are planning a third visit for next year and can't wait to again be back 'home', sipping Moroccan tea and sampling the top quality food (whether for breakfast or dinner) and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,Thank you La Maison Arabe! Fantastic Service in a beautiful riad.,"This was my 5th trip to Marrakesh and my 1st trip to La Maison Arabe. In all my trips this raid far exceeded the others. We stayed here for five nights and experienced a high standard of hospitality. The staff were friendly and helpful to our needs, including missing our flights on the return to London! We enjoyed a beautiful junior sweet that overlooked a beautiful pool garden. Each nook of this hotel had a special original feature of beautiful Marrakesh. I most enjoyed our evenings at the La Maison Arabe; they had an authentic Moroccan musician play live with string instruments, amount candle light with exquisite food! Thank you to all the staff ....... Cannot wait to return to La Maison Arabe! Highly recommend a stay at La Maison Arabe",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2016,5,This is the stuff dreams are made off,"This boutique riad is really dream-like, such a wonderful place to stay in Marrakech. Excellent service - the staff are really welcoming and caring. Rooms are interesting - although ours was somewhat on the small side and the bathroom was in need of a refresh. Food is simply delicious. Closely located to the Medina. The highlights are the antiques all over the place, breakfast / dinner by the pool area and afternoon moroccan tea by the fountain... Worth the extra cost to stay there.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Paradise,"As you will see from nearly every single other review, this hotel is faultless. It is a paradise from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. I can't think of a single complaint from my stay here. We travelled here last summer on a whim ahead of a longer trip to Italy (strangely the flights between Marrakech and Pisa are incredibly cheap!) and it did not disappoint. The hotel arranged for transit from the airport and we were met by the most charming and friendly staff. We arrived to mint tea and Moroccan cakes and were then shown to our room. The air conditioning worked a treat in the height of summer and our room was beautifully decorated and very spacious. We ate lunch in the main hotel once and dinner there twice because the food was so very good. Our table in the evening…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 July 2016,5,"Unbelievably Serene, Truly Unforgettable","Staying at Maison Arabe was a pure delight from the moment we arrived. The riad’s tasteful decor was masterfully curated by its current owner, a royal descendent himself. It feels like a palace where you can expect comfortable beds, consistent AC in your room, and incredibly helpful staff. The concierge coordinated a shuttle from the airport for us. Perfect for ease of travel, but even if you arrive by taxi, the riad is easy to find down a short walkway with a well-labeled front door. We appreciated the concierges’ expert guidance throughout our whole trip. They helped us on everything from restaurants to haggling taxi fares and efficient routes through the old city.

 June 2016,5,"Elegance, Beauty, Hospitality and Impeccable Service!","We visited Marrakech in Morocco during the third week of June 2016 and words cannot describe or justify our experience during our stay at this gorgeous gem of a hotel. But I promise to do justice by covering every aspect of the hotel and its operations. The location is pretty central in the “Old City/Medina” Section of Marrakech, and is quite surprisingly hidden away from the main streets! In fact when you first arrive, from the outside (street view), one cannot imagine what he/she will find inside this beautiful hotel. From the time we arrived and warmly greeted by our bell hop-who literarily ran towards our car, so we didn't have to wait (wow, now that’s service!!) to the time we were seated and served mint tea, in one of their reception areas prior to check in--and that too…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 April 2016,4,Expected much more from the 'first Ryad in Marrakech...',"The property is beautiful and the location is outstanding. However, is it worth the price? There are far too many options priced at the same level. in Marrakech, to settle for this one. Yes, it is historic. But, you may as well try some of the other Riads or hotels nearby. The rooms are a little run down, as is the custom in Marrakech. The breakfast was very good. The service was attentive when they could. Is it five stars? mmm maybe not. While there are Nespresso machines in the room, the hotel charges you 30/40 dirhams per capsule. Can you believe that? I know it is a small detail but it just should not happen. How can you be five stars and charge for the nespresso capsules? Are you really making money like that? What is the freaking point? Anyways, this was a small…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2016,5,A luxurious experience with incredible staff inside the Marrakesh Medina,"La Maison Arabe is an incredible hotel. The location inside the Medina provides a convenient opportunity to experience old Marrakesh on foot at any time. This is a real experience for the adventurous but not for the faint of heart. For everyone else, the hotel itself has many opportunities to relax or take excursions outside the Medina including to their athletic club outside the walls via a convenient shuttle. The ambiance in the hotel is everything you could imagine in a Moroccan Riad but what what truly sets it apart is the staff. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty, with an upgraded room and an overwhelming willingness to do whatever they could to help us plan our vacation.

Six Riads were connected to create this intricate yet authentic hotel. The spa is uniquely Moroccan with a hamam. After my treatment I spent an hour just luxuriating inside the spa. The food is of the highest quality. Your needs are anticipated by the well-trained fluent in English, French & Arabic servers. Our family stayed in the Royal Suite which provided separate areas for kids and parents with our own private rooftop deck. When I return to Morocco I will stay here without s doubt.

Coming back to this oasis was always a pleasure. They looked after all of our needs (even those we hadn't realised we had when we first arrived e.g. they sorted out our travelling papers for our return as soon as we arrived without any fuss), a welcome drink (delicious morito) and a tour.

In addition to five star luxury rooms and dining, the service is white glove in the dining room and just as attentive in the hotel. I can't say enough about how incredible it was to be taken care of upon arrival from the US. The Medina and culture can be a little intimidating and the staff made sure that all of our concerns, no matter how small were addressed. Hopefully, you will not have any incidents; however, I became very sick from drinking juice in the Medina and the staff took care of me and changed all our travel plans to accommodate my malady.

(For our hotel review, please see my separate review of the Four Seasons.) My advice to you? Take a taxi here. We walked here from the souks and had to ask for directions four times. Mind you, we are well traveled and have found our way across numerous continents with no issues. So armed with a map, off we went to find this restaurant. Oh wait, none of the street signs list the English translation of the street names. After almost giving up, we finally found it and, let me tell you, it was worth the effort.

The ambience guaranteed privacy and the attentive service set the tone for a relaxed evening. Aside from the atmosphere and the service, I was intrigued by the French Moroccan cuisine. The two flavours combine so well! From foie gras to a Moroccan tagine all within one meal really suited my palate. It is this exquisite combinations of flavours, so full on the palette that makes me dream of visiting this wonderful restaurant again!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2016,5,Best service,"From the time we walked in La Maison Arabe, everything was perfect: from the welcome drink to the upgraded room. We ate twice at the restaurant at night and it was, by far, the best meals we had in Marrakech. Breakfast with traditional Moroccan pancakes were delicious. We also had a fabulous entire day at the Country Club, great pool and very nice lunch. Needless to say the Hammam treatments we had were great as well. But what made this trip essentially outstanding was the service. They praise themselves in offering a 5 star service, it was definitely the case.

 June 2016,5,A feast for the body and soul,"My fiance and I booked a cooking course after reading all the positive reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. From the minute we walked in La Maison Arabe everything was exceptional. We were offerred tea and traditional Morrocan treats whilst waiting for our coach transfer to the Country Club, where the cooking takes place. There we were greeted by a lovely lady (I can't remember her name unfortunately) who explained all about Morrocan cooking. During our half day course we learnt to bake bread, make tea, prepare a chicken tajine and two traditional salads and had more traditional desserts. We even got a present at the end!

Fabrizio and Jose, who own the hotel, couldn't be more delightful hosts, with a staff that is as helpful and solicitous as can be.

All of a sudden we found ourselves with no idea where to stay. So I blindly picked La Maison Arabe, based on the fact that it started out as a restaurant, and we are big foodies. I will say, we struck gold. This place is impeccably decorated, excitingly maze like, the spa (that we didn't get a chance to use) looked AMAZING, and our room was big and super-romance-inducing (if you catch my drift). The best part is that their pool is in a separate location, so you get to drive through the city (via their shuttle), see the sites, then wind up in a lush, fancy, pool resort (that also has a cooking school and gorgeous gardens!). It felt like we had stayed at two different resorts…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The staff immediately made us feel welcome and the service of all staff was second to none. We spent many an hour in the Jazz Bar with Rashid's No 1 and 2. Rashid the head barman, spent so much time teaching us about the local culture and traditions and was always on hand with some new cocktail or local delicacy to try. We were upgraded to a deluxe room and it had everything we could wish for. We spent a couple of days at the Country Club where the staff were also friendly and attentive, lovely to sit by the pool in beautiful gardens to while away some hours.

Since the Riad is made up of several buildings getting from one area to the other was a series of up and down staircases with many twists and turns--a trail of breadcrumbs might have been in order. There are lots of places to sit and read a book or just sip a drink--all very pretty. Unfortunately, the area outside the hotel was a extreme a contrast from the inside and could be very intimidating for unseasoned travelers. There is also a mosque nearby so if you are a light sleeper you are likely to be awaken for the very early morning and late evening calls to prayer.

You don't even have to think what you might want - the excellent staff will have anticipated it already, and they manage to strike the perfect balance between providing a friendly 'home' in the medina and first class luxury. Our room (Suite 217) was extremely comfortable and well appointed and the service at La Maison is probably the best overall I've had anywhere in the world.

After being taken to the cooking school facility, we walked around the beautiful grounds and met our Dada (instructor). Each cooking station accommodated two people and all the instructions were televised right above our Dada. She also had us come up and participate next to her. We cooked tagines and other items.

My wish is that everyone on every budget could spend at least one night here. The staff has the attitude of a riad or B&B in terms of addressing needs and I found them to be genuinely and humanly caring and kind – not just providing a service. They are attentive to details that even I didn’t know I needed. The exquisite details throughout the facility were so artful – from the lighting choices to the magnificently carved paneling. Then there is the jazz bar and its winsome barman, Rajid telling stories and delivering history with a flair, and I could go on and on.

Reception arranged a car to pick us up at the airport and bring us to the hotel. I was glad to have the driver walk us to the hotel but found it easy to find in the maze of Marrakech. And, it is an excellent location to explore the city. Upon arrival we were taken to the courtyard, offered their signature drink, checked in, and given a tour of the beautiful property. I instantly fell in love with the décor, especially the light fixtures and carpets. Everything is beautiful and no detail has been overlooked. We were hungry, so a table was found for us immediately at the restaurant by the pool. The food was delicious, and we enjoyed a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2015,5,Superb....no need to say more,"Visited this place during my first visit to Marrakech, stopped and had lunch which was very pleasant. The staff were great so we decided to stay here when we returned. This is a perfect Riad, great location and the most polite and helpful staff I have met. Nothing is too much They also own a country club, a shuttle bus is run hourly to it. The country club is the ideal place to relax and unwind, large swimming pool, cabanas around the pool and a bar. The food served there is great too, just simple grilled local dishes. Will definitely return",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2016,5,A wonderfully relaxing environment on the edges of the medina,"We have visited Morocco in each of the previous 4 years but this was our first stay at La Maison Arabe. It is hard to imagine a more perfect location within Marrakech; close enough to El Fnaa yet far enough removed from the noise and crowds. The room was wonderfully presented and very comfortable. Food, including breakfast, was of the highest quality and all the staff were incredibly professional, cheerful and respectful. We did visit the nearby Country Club, which offered a welcome contrast to feel of the city with its very welcoming pool. Next time we are in Marrakech we will certainly be looking to revisit.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2016,5,Atmospheric drinks and dinner.,Warm and homely Marrakech style interior. Amazing service. Pool restaurant menu and atmosphere amazing with live music and twinkly romantic lighting. A must to visit. Book ahead to get into restaurant. Outside the medina so not as great a surround as other places but only a 5 min walk away.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2016,5,Brilliant hotel,Stayed here with daughter during a 4 day stay that also included an ascent of Mount Toubkal. What a great little hotel in the middle of the city. The charm and the service are truly brilliant and added so much to our trip. The front desk was outstanding!!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2016,5,Wonderful stay,"Two middle-aged ladies could not have been looked after better in this wonderful oasis. Our room was fabulous overlooking the pool, the staff could not have been more helpful (and their command of English is excellent), and the 'out of town' location is a must if you have time to relax! We took a day tour to the Atlas Mountains where they arranged a lovely lunch at a very special hotel owned by Richard Branson - fascinating. I would also recommend having an in-house Hamman - it was bliss!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2016,5,Excellent riad with 7 star staff,"We have just returned from a five night stay, the riad is in a good location for walking the city, we booked the half board package which was a great choice as both restaurants offered great food.all of the staff were excellent with nothing too much problem and proud to work there.

 April 2016,5,The Best Riad in Marrakesh,"This is our second time in La Maison Arabe. The staff is very welcoming and their service is great. We had the most beautiful Royal Suite which made me feel like a princess. A bottle of wine and beautiful pink rosses on the table gave the room a relaxing ambience. Plenty of space, very clean, beautiful lamps and furniture, good wii fii connectivity, robes and slippers available for guests. The photos exactly portray what the hotel looks like. The restaurant was great, it offered a variety of breakfast and dinner menus. We would like to thank the wonderful managers and staff for taking such good care of us and making us feel at home, shoukran Bzaff!

I recommend this unique restaurant in Marrakech,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2016,5,Simply outstanding Riad with perfect service,"We stayed for 4 nights in April on our first visit to Marrakesh. The attention to detail from the staff is faultless. The Riad itself is an oasis of calm and tranquility in the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh but being in the neck a close to all the sights and fun. The decor is traditional but wonderfully done. The room was well appointed and stylish. The breakfast by the pool is a real treat ( defiantly try the fresh roti). One evening after a busy days bartering in the souks we decided to have drinks and a light meal in the jazz bar - great music and very relaxed , a ice at to end the day The hotel has access to a country club and we would highly recommend setting an afternoon to go soak up the sun , have a relaxed lunch and a swim in this oasis in the middle of the city The…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2016,5,"Best of the best, deserves top rating","La Maison Arabe is a perfect refuge in the midst of Marrakesh. There I found peace, comfort, tranquility, and privacy. As beautifully luxurious as this hotel is, the best part of it is the generous, helpful, kindhearted staff. Need a taxi? Not only will they get you one, but they will negotiate the correct price for you, saving you at least double. Get lost in the Medina? They will send someone to find you. The spa is wonderfully serene. I had a divine massage with rose petal scented oil there. The hotel's breakfast buffet is also as good as it gets, with such treats as fresh smoked salmon, Berber pancakes, savory cornmeal torte, honey drenched figs, fresh juices, and yogurt made on premises. Afternoon tea is also included and comes with the hotels signature nonalcoholic…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2016,5,An oasis in the Medina,"Perhaps the best hotel we've ever stayed in, such a surprise to find it nestled in the old Medina providing 5* comfort without sacrificing that traditional Moroccan feel. We truly had a fabulous time with our huge thanks to the wonderful, friendly staff for making us so welcome. The services are excellent from the wonderful spa through the live jazz bar to the superb restaurant. It felt like staying in our own personal paradise deep in the heart of this amazing city. We will definitely be back and thoroughly recommend this brilliant hotel to you.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Both restaurants are excellent and the Jazz Bar is a must visit experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2016,5,5 Star Hotel and Service,If I could rate this hotel more than 5 Stars I would. The quality of service and the beautiful setting make this easily the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Every member of staff were helpful and make the experience of staying in this converted Riad all the better. An example of the service they provide - even though no one told them it was my birthday they picked up this fact from my passport and surprised me with an amazing birthday cake at dinner. This was something I was not expecting and demonstrate the level of service the employees at this hotel go to. If you stay at this hotel be sure to eat and the restaurants and visit the wine & jazz bar - both are to the top of their class.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2016,5,An Arabian Palace With The Most Accommodating Staff,"La Maison Arabe was recommended by my neighbor as her favorite hotel in Morocco. I stayed there with a friend for 3 days in early April and was not disappointed. Not only is this little gem beautifully appointed with a poolside restaurant where we had terrific breakfasts and several dinners, but the staff could not have been nicer. We received a call one morning when we didn't show up for breakfast after a late night. The staff wanted to make sure that we didn't miss the included breakfast. When I asked the concierge if he knew where there was an ATM that displayed in English (most were in Arabic and French), he had a staff member walk with me to show me where it was. Similarly, we were provided with a VCR and some English language movies because there were only a few news…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

We've tasted classics of the menu and were impressed by their extraordinary taste.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2016,5,"It has all been said already, but ought to be said again!","This riad/hotel is imaginatively conceived and wonderfully elegant. The web-site does not lie. But notwithstanding its sophistication it is the way all of the staff greet you with warm smiles, are ever helpful, and make you feel instantly and always at home which is perhaps its most memorable feature. The only slight drawback is that like most riads it offers some challenges for those with mobility problems, but. a good proportion of rooms - not all - can be accessed by elevator. Otherwise be aware that some of the staircase steps are steeper than one would normally expect. The dining area around the courtyard pool beats anything we have experienced, and the food matches it with a choice of Moroccan and international offerings. And the Jazz Bar was the perfect place for…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2016,5,Mobility Problems,"MOBILITY PROBLEMS No point is adding yet more accolades to those already given by many guests at this hotel. Of course, it is superb. Well deserving five stars. First class facilities. Excellent staff training. And for us, good value for money. In UK terms, we paid approximately 190GBP per night, including a superb breakfast in the idyllic setting of the “Trios Saveurs” restaurant, for which we were happy to linger over an hour each morning. We ate twice in the evening in the same restaurant savouring not only the high standard of cuisine on offer, but also the idyllic location and the soft live Moroccan music (different on both occasions we dined). My only reservation would be for any guests with mobility problems. Although the hotel has one lift/elevator connecting each…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Had we not already booked and paid for the following portion of our trip, we would have extended our stay. We were so comfortable, so well taken care of, so in awe of the beauty and attention to detail in both our room and the riad as a whole. Three nights wasn't enough to fully explore the mosaics, paintings, stenciling, fixtures, gardens, bars and restaurants and pools. We arrived wanting to explore Marrakech, dine out at a variety of different places, but we found the restaurants at La Maison so excellent that we figured trying anywhere else would be a let down and opted to take all our meals in the hotel. Likewise, while we had the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

It's beautiful with lots of Moroccan lamps spreading patterns on the walls. We were welcomed with Berber whiskey (green tea and mint) and a tour of the hotel. We were three couples and all of the rooms were gorgeous. The beds were super comfy and bathrooms were really nice. We took advantage of the hotels amenities. We ate dinner in the dining room - it was expensive for Morocco but the $20 dinner was delicious and a good value for the money. They serve wine and a musician played lovely background music. They have a jazz bar and gave free sips of frosty drinks. We also experienced the Hammam (baths) - the spa was first class. And the breakfasts were delicious - plenty to choose from, five…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2016,5,Outstanding riad and service,"A beautiful riad that blends traditional design with modern facilities, with comfortable beds and modern bathrooms. The service from the staff was outstanding. They went out of their way to make us welcome and help us navigate Marrakech and its culture. The food in both restaurants was exceptional, the jazz bar with live piano and guitar music created a wonderful start to each evening which was relaxed and enjoyable. The hammam and massage were also excellent. I highly recommend the Cookery school to learn how to cook tagine and understand Moroccan food better. A quite simply stunning place to stay and somewhere I could happily return to year after year.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 April 2016,5,BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN 30 YEARS OF 5* TRAVEL,"Excellent junior Suite overlooking the pool, bright and spacious, great for family of 3. Our daughter was provided with a proper single bed, some hotels only provide a wafer thin fold up type thing, so we were impressed. Ambiance in the hotel was perfect, whole place very relaxing. Hotel is charming and has a sense of authenticity, the SPA treatments are very good, but the real reason to stay is the quality of the staff, they really do care that you are having a good time, nothing is too much trouble, they turned the hotel upside down to find the very last of my favourite teabags, even though I was quite prepared to go without. And that was one of many little things they did for us. Extra mile.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2015,5,Tranquil place to call home,"La Maison Arabe was exceeding our expectations in every way. To start first with the staff, they are exceptional and always ready to help. Checking in was a breeze. We were placed in the old wing but we loved the traditional decor and the balcony that is overlooking the court so we were very happy. The food was phenomenal, breakfast was free with the meal and they make those amazing bread on-site to order. For dinner, we ate at the hotel 3 nights of the 4 (one of the meal was at the market) and we enjoyed each and very meal. We would have loved to take a cooking class (the kitchen and the facility was looking very high tech and cool) but didn't sign up in time.

 April 2016,5,Superb,"After being in Marrakech with a group of 9 for the preceding week, 2 of us lingered here an extra 2 days as the reward for surviving the chaos outside the hotel. I cannot possibly give La Maison Arabe all the praise it deserves: superb service from ALL staff members, gorgeous room with a balcony overlooking the pool, an ultra comfortable bed and lovely amenities. The breakfast by the pool was an ideal way to begin the day and dinner in the traditional restaurant (after cocktails in the Jazz Bar) a perfect way to end it. The time spent in the spa (traditional hammam, 4 hand massage, manicure/pedicure) was blissful. The spa itself is an oasis of calm and beauty.

The riad is just a superb place to be and the staff are a total delight, with every one of them wanting to ensure your stay is thoroughly enjoyed. They are so attentive to your needs but at the same time never over bearing. From the rush of the souks coming back to the riad is like entering a quiet haven with all the comforts, enjoying a tea in the courtyard or a lovely evening meal by the pool. We asked the reception if they could arrange a visit to the Atlas mountains (use Tourar Mohamed) and we had a driver for the day and the rate charged was less than we had gained off the internet. We had Momo the owner as the driver. He was a safe driver and had a wonderful life story to tell as he was a genuine…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,Lovely stay,"My husband and I stayed at La Maison Arabe in March 2016. He already listed a review under Shahyad Esfandiary but as I truly loved this place, I wanted to add my own. :) The hotel itself is absolutely charming and feels very authentic (typical Morrocan riad). It has a lovely pool in the middle of the riad. Eating around the pool at night is just delightful!! The one negative about the pool (as somebody who loves to swim) is that the sun is on it in the morning and it is completely in the shadow as of about 1 pm; also, it is next to the main restaurant so it feels a bit weird swimming while everyone around you is fully clothed having lunch. Now about the feel of the hotel: I have to say it is honestly one of the friendliest hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff is genuinely…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2016,5,Dripping with Moroccan ambiance and hospitality,"From the moment that you enter the secluded, but well-located riad, and have their special mint tea and pastries, to wandering through the corridors with wonderful decorations until you get to your uniquely decorated room, to breakfast (and any other meal that you want, each of which has fabulous food) in one of their two restaurants (one of which surrounds the pool), you feel like you are in another world. Say goodby to chain hotels and immerse yourself in Moroccan culture and hospitality. The staff exists only to make your stay totally enjoyable.

 March 2016,4,Amazing Hotel,"Had a great week here in March 2016. The rooms were a little higgledy-piggledy but wonderfully decorated and overall still spacious. The numerous small courtyards are stunning and great for an evening drink before dinner. The SPA is a must! If you are there for a few days, take them up on the offer to go to the country club for a morning or afternoon. Beautiful garden with outdoor pool and a lot less crowded than the hotel. The only thing stopping me from giving a 5 star review was that the service, although extremely amicable and polite, was often quite slow. If this were a ""normal"" hotel it wouldn't have bothered me but for the money you pay, you expect 5* service, which was not always the case in terms of speed, especially during breakfast where simple scrambled eggs…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The hotel and rooms are very tastefully decorated in Morrocan style, excellent food in 2 restaurants,for breakfast and afternoon tea. Stylish bar with live guitar music helps to put you in a dining mood.Also available for hotel guests is a Country Club with swimming pool, sun lounges and small restaurant only approx. 20 minutes away by free transfer.

 March 2016,5,Marrakech gem,"The ideal introduction to Marrakech is through the pleasures of La Maison Arabe. Just inside the walls of the Medina and entered from a quiet alley, it is an oasis of quiet, charm and hospitality that reflects the traditions of Morocco and the hospitality of the people but provides all the comforts and amenities expected by western visitors. The public spaces are quiet and marked by the sound of water in the fountains. Our room was comfortable with a shaded terrace and seating area. Breakfast and dinner by the pool were delightful experiences and the hotel's private pool, garden and cooking school in the Palmerai reached by the hotel's shuttle is as pleasant a retreat as I have ever seen. All in all, one of the best small hotels in the world.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,Great place in the city,"I had been to Marrakesh many times in the past and for the most part I would stay outside of the city. However, for the first time we decided to try a Riad experience in town. The hotel was very nice and the people very welcoming. Their welcome cocktail was extremely good. Even when we had some unwelcome visitors, the managers of the hotel made up for it with extreme kindness. I would recommend this hotel for a great place within walking distance of the Souk. PLus the prices are reasonable.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2016,5,Three nights in Marrakech,"What a relaxing, traditional and authentic experience, the decor and surroundings are absolutely beautiful, with a photo opportunity around every corner. The breakfasts, lunch and evening dinners are of a high standard set in lovely surroudings, this included a lunch at their country club ten minutes away, this place is divine and very peaceful. The riad has a lot of stand out features, but their main asset is their fantastic, hardworking and highly professional staff, especially I may add those members of staff working at the reception area, highly courteous and efficient, dealing with minor issues quickly and effectively, I must add that a lovely gentlemen who served us lunch on our last day made us a portion of fig and olive pate spread to bring home with us as we commented…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The facilities are great, with amazing breakfasts, complimentary afternoon tea & pastries and the most comfortable bed I've slept in. The whole experience was sealed by the staff, who were all so friendly and welcoming, and who displayed fantastic attention to detail (even to the extent that noticing on check in my finger was bleeding and bringing me a plaster).

 April 2016,5,Best Place to be in Marrakech!,"If you are not looking for very authentic Moroccan experience, this Riad is a perfect place for you to stay. The food and service here in this Riad was all one of the most fantastic we found in Morocco. However, the food and whole style is pretty westernized to cater to the tastes of the tourists.

The hotel is situated in a great location, within walking distance of many sites, a shuttle bus to the hotel's pool in a beautiful secluded area, or it is equally as easy to grab a taxi. We had a fascinating experience: exploring the souks, a trip up to the Atlas Mountains and learning all about Marrakech and it's history. I would most definitely recommend a trip here. Our experience was incredible and it would be a dream to return to La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,The staff are all very helpful and friendly,"The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The food in the hotel restaurants' (Moroccan or Hotel) was very good and there are many excellent places outside the hotel too, within walking distance. Also, the breakfast is included in the stay which was a real bonus. There is a (plunge) pool in the hotel grounds and a bigger pool about a 10 minute drive away by shuttle bus. The latter pool is in a beautiful location and is very secluded. You can hear the call to prayer from all parts of the hotel which is very peaceful. There are many trips that can be organised by the hotel, from cookery school, to a trip to the atlas mountains for a day. (The latter is certainly worth a visit!)",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,Great Stay,"We stayed in three places in Marrakech during a recent trip and La Maison Arabe was an authentic, warm experience in a wonderful riad, with the best service we experienced. The staff was extremely attentive to detail and accommodating, noting it was my birthday and making a special occasion about that. We had our room upgraded to suite, which was an unexpected surprise. The facilities were a bit less posh and updated than the other places we stayed but the staff made this a warm and wonderful experience overall.

 March 2016,5,The perfect respite after shopping the souk and touring the historic city,"This is the hotel for you if you are looking for old style Moroccan charm. It is beautifully decorated and the service is impeccable. The helpful and smiling staff anticipates every need. The cooking class is well worth a morning and is offered at the country club, a 10 or 15 minute van trip from the downtown area. It's delightful to swim and relax here in the gardens after shopping in the souk and visiting the palaces. We wouldn't hesitate to return.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,Five Stars Are Not Enough,"La Maison Arabe is beautifully decorated. The rooms are large and extraordinarily comfortable. Many of them have terraces or small, shaded outdoor spaces typical of elegant Arab houses. The public areas are a pleasure to hang around in, to read comfortably in while sitting on a beautifully upholstered sofa as the soft trickle of a nearby fountain soothes the atmosphere. As good as all this stuff is, the best part of this superb hotel is the warmth and competence and generosity of the staff. In short, a stay at La Maison Arabe is sublime.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,The hotel of your dreams,"This was at least my eighth stay at the Maison Arabe and there is a reason why I keep coming back. This time I brought 16 friends with me. Not only is La Maison Arabe incredibly beautiful but from the moment you step inside you feel at home. The food, the decor, the service are unequaled. The hotel owns a garden and pool in the Palmeraie where you can take cooking lessons in a superbly designed kitchen, or relax under the sweet olive trees. Who could ask for more?",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,A very special hotel and experience,"La Maison Arabe was perfection. Elegant old-world (but not stiff) service in an atmosphere that reflected something both traditionally Moroccan and something timeless. It felt more like an oasis in the middle of the fast-paced medina than merely a hotel. My room overlooking the pool was wonderful, great bed, tons of closet space, yet I spent lots of time in the common areas, relaxing, reading and socializing with fellow travelers. Loved the dreamy outdoor restaurant. The hotel has it all: service, décor, excellent menu, fantastic bar. For the quality offered, I felt it was fairly priced. I didn’t go to their country annex pool until my last day, and really regret not having discovered it earlier during my stay.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,Definitely a five star operation!,"This is a hotel with service which includes remembering your name, and serving you a bottle of wine to apologize for unexpected noise (incidental repairs). The restaurant is superb (although the most expensive we went to in Morocco), and we went all three nights we were in Marrakech. We also attended the cooking school, a well organized and well worth it experience; and my wife did a spa treatment she liked very much. We spent an extra $500 here in three days with the dinners, spa and cooking school; but it was well worth it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,Best boutique hotel EVER,Our visit started with a welcome tea in the courtyard followed by a tour of the raid. The hotel itself - very elegant and decoration very well suited. We were upgraded to a very beautiful room and a full sized kids bed was already set up for our little one. It wasn't requested. They just did it. They anticipate your needs and take care of it before you have to ask- like bring afternoon tea to you. There is always staff around to help you with whatever you need. They are everywhere and ready to help. I'm truly impressed with this little place. I will be back.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2016,5,"Fabulous food, but......","We visited La Maison Arabe during our recent holiday to Marrakech. Going down an alleyway to an unassuming door which opens up to the most amazing interior is amazing. It was like stepping back in time to the 1940's. We were seated in reception and then given a guided tour starting with the music room, where a pianist was playing. To say the Maison Arabe is like a Tardis is an understatement! There are many levels, each as beautiful as the last. When we reached the dining area, we were blown away. Its beautiful. You are seated around a pool in a courtyard, which is completely enclosed. There are beautiful plants and discreet lighting. As for the food.....its all good. I had the lamb tagine and Hubby had the fish.

The little things made all the difference... We were immediately upgraded to a Junior Suite at no extra cost and there were fresh roses and a complimentary half-bottle of wine brought to our room. The room service was superb, and speedily delivered. The super-king bed was incredibly comfortable with no sign of damp that a lot of the Riads in Marrakesh suffer from. We left feeling well-taken care of, very relaxed and felt that even though the cost was high compared to other Hotels in Marrakesh, it was well worth it and agreed we would return as soon as we could!

 February 2016,5,Magical Visit to Marrakech!,"Spent a week at the La Maison Arabe at the end of February and it couldn't have been better! The riad was gorgeous--not in a showy, glitzy sort of way that you get in many hotels today. Rather, it was wonderfully restored with beautiful artifacts, rugs, tilework, lighting (oh, the lighting!), etc. Every item seemed to have been carefully curated to create a sense of the magic and history that one might envision in Marrakech. The first part of my trip was spent in a junior room (patio side) which I was quite happy with--large, beautiful tilework in the bathroom. When I decided to extend my stay, a lovely young woman at the front desk graciously upgraded me to a suite (#243) which was exquisite. Very large with 2 room bathroom, separate bed and living area with fireplace, and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2016,5,Phenomenal Last Night in Marrakech!,"Disclaimer: I didn't stay here BUT I came across it hidden away in the medina while wondering through the souks on my last night in town and had the MOST wonderful experience! I ate in the gorgeous piano bar. The food was superb (chicken tagine), the ambience was perfect (beautiful dark wood, lush seating and carpets, paintings, candles- you get the picture) and the service from Rashid and music from the lovely pianist -- made it a night to remember. Thank you so much to everyone, especially Rashid, for such a beautiful goodbye to a very special city. Can't wait to return and actually stay here!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2016,5,"Wonderful hotel, outstanding service","We had a fantastic week long stay at La Maison Arabe. The service was outstanding and staff were friendly warm and kind, helpful at all times. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to meet our every need. The reception staff were especially helpful and I particularly appreciated one of the team (sadly I didn’t ask his name and he didn’t have a name badge!), who just got on the phone and rearranged our independent Atlas mountain trip for us, when bad weather was forecast. The hotel is beautifully and sumptuously decorated with countless handcrafted artefacts to marvel at. It is an oasis of calm in the hectic medina. There was a wonderful array of food on offer for breakfast and we also ate delicious tagines and couscous dishes for dinner in the Moroccan…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

A living room and restroom on the ground floor, the master bedroom on the second and a rooftop deck on the third with an outdoor jacuzzi and sun deck. There are two large restaurants--we chose the one by the pool and it had some of the tajjines that we've tasted in Morocco.

 February 2016,5,Fantastic hotel in central location,"La Maison Arabe is a top rated hotel for a reason. The style and finish of the hotel is superb, full of local tapestries, rugs, and riad/courtyard-style architecture. You truly feel the luxurious Arab theme, which is what we were after on our first trip to Morocco. The staff were perhaps the best part of the experience as they cater to all your needs and help with any arrangements required for excursions away from the hotel. They even had doormen run to the corner shop to get things for us. Staff always greeted with a smile and you never feel like you're troubling them when needing assistance. The two restaurant offered great food - top notch. We ate at the top 3 rated fine dining places in Marrakech and La Maison, being one of them, was deserving of the rating.

We shared our incredible stay with our 2 young boys, who were much welcomed and attentively with joy looked after. Even after leaving Morocco the hotel and its most helpful staff, especially Mr. Jillou (THANK YOU AGAIN!), went completely out of their way and helped retrieve a lost item I had left at the airport.

We could not fault any aspect of the hotel and its beautiful way of looking after its guests. The Hammam is superb and truly relaxing as you would probably expect. We met a very well travelled couple from Switzerland with their children who had visited Marrakesh at least 12 times four of which had been at the famous La Mamounia- their view was that La maison Arabe was far far better and so much more relaxing, which is why their last five visits had been at La…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

We chose it for the excellent reviews and with only 26 rooms it really was the perfect choice for a romantic birthday treat. We loved the location, its tucked away so you'd never know about the oasis behind its high walls. The layout of the hotel is quite unusual but this adds to the charm. The relaxing areas are intimate, well thought out and beautifully presented. A pleasant surprise was a free room upgrade at check in. The staff on reception were always friendly and understand how to give you advice (thank you very much Hakeem), whether walking to a local restaurant or organising a trek to the Atlas Mountains.

Staff went above and beyond and were very friendly, room was amazing, however the very nice manager was very apologetic 'as you come on holiday for tranquility' and gave us an upgrade. The breakfast was great, lots of choice, we ate in the restaurant at night a few times and food was always excellent! The hotel is 5-10 mins away from the medina, very handy however as soon as you enter the hotel it is so peaceful and is a little bit of paradise within the busy streets of Marrakech. I've never been to such a beautiful hotel with such perfect service. Very reasonably priced! All in all, perhaps the nicest and best-value hotel that I have stayed in.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The room we were given was beautifully decorated, cool, comfortable and spotlessly clean. Breakfast by the pool was a a great way to start the day and in the evening a drink in the bar followed by a meal in the Moroccan Restaurant was just superb.

You can take as read that it is beautiful, comfortable, luxurious etc and that the food is excellent. This time I want to talk about the staff and service. Quite honestly, there is nothing that would faze them I don't think, and if I had a serious issue I would think Adil and the team could solve anything quickly and professionally.

Everyone from the bellman to the front desk to the waiters was helpful, warm, and friendly - without being at all intrusive. The Hamam & massage were wonderful.

When we arrived they took our bags and directed us to sit in the courtyard whilst they checked us in. We were then lead around the hotel by the manager. The hotel is a traditional Riad, or should I say a number of Riads all stuck together to make one large hotel. The hotel has two restaurants, a lovely swimming pool/courtyard, a spa and a jazz bar.

After a short tour, we were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite with a view of the garden and pool. Throughout our stay, we were beautifully looked after by all the staff with not even the smallest detail overlooked. It was if they could anticipate our thoughts!

From the moment my husband and I walked through the front door through the final good byes by the excellent staff, it was nothing but awesome. Like so much of Marrakech, the beauty faces inward. The building is the product of a lavish renovation of three older mansions that made us feel like we were guests of a Moorish palace. The amenities were superb, from the two elegant restaurants to the relaxing spa. But I leave my greatest praises for the incredible staff who was always able to anticipate our every need or whim.

We were told that complimentary tea would be served every afternoon - on our return each day we ordered English tea to our room which was served with a family size pot and sweet pastry delicacies - and true to their word it was complimentary, and not charged to the bill.

One day we did a walking tour of Jemaa el Fna and the souks, and the next day we took a trip to the Atlas mountains.

 November 2015,5,Excellent place,"This was our first visit to Morocco. We were trying to make it for quiet some times now, but it got delayed since we were not sure where to stay. From the moment where we were picked up from Marrakech airport till we left to Fez, the Management of La Maison Arabe had extended their hospitality beyond our expectation. They arranged the pick up (for a price). Our room was upgraded to meet our comfort zone. The breakfast and dinner were excellent and authentic to the area. It is an amazing place, the inside setup as an original Riad. The people who served us were sincere and talented, they are ready to look after minor details. The neighbourhood is in the historic part of Marrakech yet it is within an easy access to the main road. My wife and I would like to thank all the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2015,5,Perfect stay,"We visited La Maison Arabe in the end of december 2015. The vibe of the riad is just perfect, we fell in love with this place. The room was beautiful, we had our own terrace. We were welcomed by a very friendly staff, who stayed interested, proactive and very helpful throughout our stay. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere in the evening, the food is really good and there was live music. On the last day, we treated ourselves with a nice massage. And we must say, this is one of the best we ever had! After the massage, Racheed asked us to come to the jazz bar right away. And so we did. A musician was playing, there was a cozy fire and we were welcomed with a mocktail. But that was not all. Since it was Dries' birthday, the staff started singing happy birthday and he got a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2015,4,Beautiful Riad,"Riad is in a very convenient location close to all the main attractions. Staff are extreemly helpful and will assist you in all things - from ordering a local taxi, pointing you to areas of interest nearby and securing a guide for the day. The building is impeciably maintained and decorated throughout - it is clean, relaxing, sumptuously lit and a real joy to spend time in - a real feast for the eyes! Breakfast was good, but I can imagine the variety becoming a little tedious after more than a 5 day stay. The home-made yoghurt was delicious though! They offer free tea and coffee in the afternoon, a choice of coffee would have been nice - we were genuinely very thirsty and an expresso did little to quench that thirst whilst a caffe latte would have been just right! The jazz bar…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2015,5,Our best experience in Marrakech,"We cannot say enough about this truly memorable experience. Every detail is executed and the staff goes above and beyond in making your time here enjoyable. Our only regret is not spending more time here.

 December 2015,5,Stunning,"We went there for my 50th Birthday, I wanted some where special and I wasn't disappointed. We ate by the pool, it was all lit up with candles and lovely lights. The service was very good, friendly and professional. The food was stunning, I ordered a tagine which was very filing. The waiters sang 'happy birthday' and presented me with a beautiful piece of cake with a candle. When we arrived we were taken to the bar, for special cocktails on the house. All in all a really lovely place, with lots of history which the waiter will tell you all about. Not cheap though.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2015,5,Beautiful Riad and Fantastic Service,"Located just inside the edges of the Medina which makes it very convenient to either walk further into the Medina (the main square is a 15 minute walk), or catch a taxi to head into the new city. There are convenience shops, a pharmacy, cheap cafes, and nice restaurants all within a block or two. Unassuming from the outside, beautiful on the inside. This is a full service riad complete with two restaurants, a heated pool, solarium, private hammam, a jazz bar, patio, off site gardens, a cooking school, and more. There's even a boutique owned by the hotel around the corner where you can buy goods in a hassle free environment.

 June 2015,5,"Wonderful, amazing, .. place!",You will not go wrong staying at La Maison Arabe. The staff is wonderful and the hotel is beautiful. We were a large group of family traveling together - we had a driver and car driving us to Marrakech - the car broke down and we had to wait for quite sometime for a new vehicle. So once we arrived at La Maison Arabe we were very tired. The staff whisked us to our rooms and sent us food right away. They were beyond wonderful. The hotel is very tastefully decorated and comfortable. We stayed in suites - which I would recomend. Great location too as we could walk to the souks and to the main square. ALso make sure you get to the bar and meet the bar tender - have him make you a Marrakech version of the mojito. Delish!

Just absolutely beautifully decorated, well appointed and as tasteful as anywhere I've ever stayed. I was visiting Marrakesh for the first time and had arrived at midnight on a Friday after a work week in Rabat. I had no idea what I would do in the two short days that I had but in 15 minutes the following morning with Mr. Adil, the Duty Manager, I had a plan worked out that took me to the souk, Madrasa, some gorgeous gardens and at trip into the High Atlas mountains.

 November 2015,5,Perfect respite in the medina,"La Maison Arabe was a perfect respite after ten days traveling through Morocco. Their greeting was more than gracious. Sitting in the charming Riad drinking our welcome beverage, we knew we were in the right place. Our room was in the newer wing. It was large, beautifully designed, comfortable and completely quiet. It overlooked the pool and dining area. Sitting at the edge of the medina, it is a very short walk to most of the important sites in the old city. We felt perfectly safe walking to and from the Jamaâ El-fna late in the evening. We had planned to eat in the restaurant only one evening, but it was so good, we decided that after exhausting ourselves the second day, we would stay in for dinner.

 November 2015,5,A fantastic and beautiful place,"We chose this place after reading good reviews about it on Trip Advisor. We were very happy and comfortable there. The staff were very friendly and obliging. We booked a standard room with a garden view. We were upgraded to a suite with a garden view which was very nice. However, the next morning we woke up to construction banging and lots of noise. We complained about it to the front desk and they apologized profusely. That was the business next to them who were renovating. In any case, by the time we had finished our breakfast they offered us a change of room and this time to the royal suite :). That was surprising and very sweet of them. They have two royal suites and we stayed in one of them.

It's a beautiful Riad and you walk through beautifully decorated rooms to step into the restaurant in a sunken room that is all red. The tables around the room are positioned to face the center and the musicians played traditional Moroccan music. The food is traditional too. We order the Moroccan salads, many small plates of cooked and sautéed vegetables. All spiced perfectly. Then I ordered the lamb tajina (different from a tagine) slowly cooked lamb in its own clay pot for hours. It was SO tender and delicious! My husband had the chicken couscous with vegetables. Huge portions and all wonderful. We had a rose Medallion Moroccan wine and we were too full for dessert. But…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 November 2015,5,Outstanding! Cannot imagine finding a better place to stay in Marrakech!!,"I had the pleasure of staying at this historic riad, the first one in Marrakech I am told. This has to be the one to set the standards for all other riad-hotels. Frankly, I did not know a riad from a hotel when making the booking. I was looking for a place to stay that had good customer service and strong wifi, because of my business needs. Well, this riad's wifi was indeed excellent. But what I did not expect was the amazing lodging experience. The location was, in my opinion, perfect. A short walk to the famous market, which was an adventure in itself. The riad itself was simply beautiful and clearly someone put so much thought into the design of each and every room, including all the public spaces.

The staff were amazing, both restaurants fantastic and the free suite upgrade incredible. Despite not telling the hotel, they notice when we checked in that it was my birthday and so they arranged a cake with our evening meal and also drinks in the bar completely free. This level of attention to detail shows a team of people that want to excel at their job. The whole ambiance is just what we were looking for and we will certainly be back.

 December 2014,5,One of the Most Charming Places in Marrakech,"We had lunch at La Maison Arabe and the setting and food were so good that we went back for dinner. Unfortunately, there was a private party and the restaurant was closed that night, but it worked out well because we went and sat in the enchanting, old world bar, had cocktails and listened to music. Because I was so enamored with this place, I asked the manager to show me a room. It was absolutely charming and I know that this is where we will be staying when we return.

 October 2015,5,Fantastic!,"We had a fantastic stay at this hotel/riad. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They arranged guided tours for us in the soukes and other places of interest in Marrakech, as well as a daytrip to the Atlas mountains. The guides/driver was the best. We ended up having dinner at the hotel nearly every evening because the food was excellent, together with the service and atmosphere.

The room and bathroom are amazing. The shower has a couple options for rain shower vs regular. Pressure is great. The soaps and lotions smell divine. I took a bath in the separate tub, which was lovely. We spent some time on our terrace drinking wine and appreciating the weather. We took the cooking class one day which was great and quite modern.

 November 2015,5,A gem,"We booked ten days at Maison Arabe after reading its TripAdvisor reviews. We like small hotels with character and great service, and Maison Arabe certainly didn't disappoint. Its best feature by far is its staff. Friendly and warm, nothing is too much trouble for them. They truly want guests to enjoy their stay and will go out of their way to make it so. After I shyly asked if they would have gluten free bread, it appeared at my table every day, and also fabulous GF cakes.

 November 2015,5,Couldn't fault it,"We stayed 3 nights at La Maison Arabe for our 10th wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect. It's a lovely hotel - it's like a giant riad and has Marrakech's oldest restaurant within it. Room was great and had a small balcony & seating area. Breakfast was delicious. But most of all the staff were super friendly and the standard of service very high. We spent an afternoon at La Moumounia hotel and whilst it was a much more grand hotel, the staff all seemed thoroughly miserable!

 November 2015,5,FANTASTIC MEMORABLE STAY !!! 6 STAR SERVICE.,"having used trip adviser to help pick the perfect hotel , we could not possibly have chosen better. I have stayed in quite a few hotels but this was by far the most memorable comfortable, picturesque friendly hotel of them all. The minute we walked in we were greeted with a cool refreshing drink and then shown round the stunning oasis of a mini palace. For a smallish hotel it had 2 restaurants and a piano bar , all extremely stunning and live music every night. On top of all that a hammam (spa) which must be indulged . Every member of staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and did everything that could to make us feel like royalty but not in a pompous uncomfortable way.

The location is great, most of the sight seeings and markets are in walking distance, even the new part ""Gueliz"" can be walked to if you don't mind a longer walk. The rooms and bathrooms could use a freshening up, however everything was in good order and nicely done. What I really would like to mention is their excellent level of service. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and their approach is: If it can be done, it will be done. Quite amazing, better than in many 5 stars hotels worldwide. Therefore they get the highest rating from me.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2015,5,TEA / COFFEE IN A FANTASTIC SETTING!,"While on holiday in Marrakech we visited La Maison Arabe and asked if we could have morning tea / coffee - we were non-residents. From the relatively unassuming entrance you could never guess what a fabulous riad this is. The staff were so friendly, helpful and attentive. We were shown to a beautiful courtyard where we had tea, coffee, soft drinks and pastries. We were also given a guided tour of part of this magnificent riad. This was a special treat in a really sumptuous location. Just superb!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2015,2,"Very Disappointed, it is a rip off!!, It doesnt make me to come back","the hotel look much bigger and nicer in the pictures, The hotel is very old and small, the welcome bottle of wine you find in the room is undrinkable, horrible, the room very strong smell of humidity. I could not sleep, the swimming pool very small, is more for a decoration pool, they do have another swimming pool like half hour in car from the hotel, it is annoying because you spend 30 minutes going and 30 minutes coming back. It is a nice pool but the water is frozen, the water should be heated. the hotel is very expensive, 132Dh for a cold sandwich, 283.25DH for lamb ribs. It is a rip off!! I don't understand how can be so expensive when the medium salaries are around 3000Dh/4000DH a month and living in Morocco is much cheaper than Europe. I spent less money in 5 stars…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 October 2015,5,"What an amazing, friendly place to stay.","This Riad is right in the centre of Marrakech, so close to all the sights and sounds of Morocco. It is steeped in the local culture and the most beautiful place to stay. The rooms were really comfortable and all the staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We ate in the restaurant each night and the food was delicious. My 13 year old daughter has an allergy to dairy products but by day two, all the waiting staff knew who she was and the chefs cooked for her accordingly. She has never been to any place where she can have more or less what she wants. I would recommend this Hotel / Riad to anyone of any age if staying in Marrakech. I will certainly be visiting again in the future. As you can tell we loved it!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2015,5,Special,"I can only echo the superlatives previously used to describe La Maison Arabe. My family and I were blown away by the attention to detail at LMA and the focus given to customer care. Every single member of staff went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed and couldn't have done any more to make us feel at home. You truly feel like guests of honour. The decor is wonderful, with lots of handcrafted finishing, the rooms very comfortable and the location very convenient, but it is the attitude and effort of the staff that makes a stay at LMA so memorable. Hope to return again soon and would recommend to anyone without hesitation.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2015,5,Extremely good,"I have been fortunate enough to stay at some of the world's best hotels ( Raffles in Singapore, Claridges, The Plaza etc). The service in Maison Arabe is certainly equal to any of these & in some cases better). The hotel ( more like a Moroccan house really ) is extremely comfortable and well furnished. The restaurants are good, with a very high level of service and the food also good quality. It has a very good location in the Medina & the main square is about 10 mins walk away. This was our 2nd stay and will have no hesitation in returning should we return to Marrakech which we probably will. I would give it the highest recommendation.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

I travelled to Marrakech with my 73-year-old mother and 2-year-old son, and remain completely indebted to the staff at La Maison Arabe for making our stay memorable, stress-free and wonderful. From the moment we arrived at this magnificent property and were greeted by the effortlessly gracious Morat, to the moment we left 4 days later, no request was ever too much, and more often than not, we did not need to make requests as staff had thought of our needs even before we knew we had them.

They seemed to know exactly what you required before you asked, cannot praise them high enough. We had a standard room which was perfectly adequate for our needs,the bed was very comfortable and had all the modern amenities required nowadays.

Some building works were taking place next to the hotel with banging starting at 7. A quick word with the reception desk and this was sorted out to start a little later. They even offered to pay for our cooking course . We also took advantage of the spa as well as the ""country club"".",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2015,5,Faultless,"The Maison Arabe redefines 5 star quality and service - so often these days a star rating is given to a hotel based on facilities rather than service, this is definitely not the case with the Maison Arabe. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by our host Ishmael who escorted us to the open air Riad courtyard for a welcome drink whilst he took care of the 'check in' process, after which we were given a tour of the hotel (much needed as the building has so much history and has evolved over many years into a quirky hotel with many different levels).

Staying here is like staying in a luxury private home with family, that is how the staff makes you feel. From the moment you arrive a friendly greeting and a welcome drink is your first experience. After a day of touring and shopping it is great to come back and head to the Jazz Bar for a drink and music with the most friendly waiters. No need to search every night for a restaurant , as your hotel has one of the best. The rooms are really comfortable and quiet as well.

 October 2015,5,Out of this world customer service,"I have stayed at so many 5-star hotels around the world, but this one exceeds all my previous experiences with both hotel charm and the customer service. Location is great - right when you enter Medina, so it is accessible by car and you are not too deep in Medina's because it can get hectic with visitors and locals. So much design detail was given to this hotel/riad so I got to experience a real Moroccan design. Customer service, as my review's title suggests, was out of this world - it was superb. I have not experienced this anywhere else yet. I definitely recommend this riad to anyone going to Marrakesh.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2015,5,Be treated like loyalty,Amazing place and service. Beautifully decorated and interesting layout. The special rooms and treats go on and on. The breakfast is first rate and dinner was excellent. And additional bonus is the country club 15 minutes outside of the hotel that is a sanctuary from bustle of the city.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2015,5,Best service ever!,"My mum (61) and I (30) visited this delightful riad/hotel in October 2015 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, predominately due to the quality and friendliness of the service. The location is very good, being just a short stroll from the medina, but in a quiet and pleasant area. The front desk staff are very willing to advise on places to eat, activities to undertake, customs to be aware of and to order taxis and to escort you to them, as well as negotiating the fares. Nothing was too much trouble for the team - particular ""wow what great service"" moments included providing us with chilled bottles of water for the journey home, completing our departure forms for us and remembering what we liked to drink for breakfast. One especially nice aspect of this hotel is the country…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2015,5,A fantastic place to stay,"A late review as I have only just thought to add this, we stayed for a week and it was fantastic, the service was impeccable and food was equally as great! The addition of having the country club to retreat to was lovely as it is a very busy bustling city. Would definitely recommend staying here for a break in marrakesh and I would certainly go back!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2015,5,Paradise,"Excellent stay, raid absolute paradise. The staff very helpful,could not do enough for you. We ate in the resturant a couple of times the food was suburb, the surroundings by candle light very romantic. We also visited there country club an extra bonus couldn't fail anything would highly recommend",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Absolutely perfect,"It's difficult to know where to start with La Maison Arabe. From the moment we arrived for a birthday surprise long weekend, when we were unexpectedly upgraded to the royal suite (over three floors, including a stunning sun terrace), the staff couldn't have done more to make our stay more enjoyable or memorable. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. As others have said, the hotel is situated off a quiet side street in the Northern Medina, but the unprepossessing exterior is hugely misleading. Made up of six roads pulled into one complex, the hotel is beautifully and tastefully decorated and laid out. There were so many highlights of our stay. Here are just a few: - breakfast offered a fantastic range of local and international dishes. Served in the central court along the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Perfect,"Beautiful small hotel. Every possible comfort and amenity. Good central location but quiet and peaceful. First class restaurant (especially the Moroccan restaurant. A third of the price of La Mammounia and three times better !). Excellent shuttle to their rural country club if you feel like a break from the city. Above all charming staff - relaxed,helpful and efficient. One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Excellent Riad in the Medina,"This hotel lives up to the reviews. One of the best services we have had in a hotel. Pros: - Top service from every single member of staff - Close to the main attractions in the Medina - Offsite pool is relaxing and quiet - Breakfast outstanding - Room very comfortable - Good wifi Cons: - The room was a little dark - No tea making facilities On checking in we were introduced to a member of staff that was taking care of us for the checkin process. We were taken straight to the bar area where we could relax and drink our welcome drinks while we waited for our room. When we were ready we were given a tour of the Riad before being shown our room which they had upgraded for us free of charge!

 October 2015,5,WHAT.......!!!!!,"When we got picked up in the airport in a Mercedes, I said to myself the hotel must be very nice.... When the taxi stopped, I said where is hotel? He said he will call hotel porter to come and collect luggage.... My first reaction, this is not happening..... Especially when I followed the porter to this unattractive hotel frontage.... However when I entered....... They called my name without even checked in... Through out the stay, every staff greeted you by your name...! Very personal touch..!! I will leave the praise aside for you to experience .. All I can say is the cooking class was interesting and even the Four Season's Regional Manager was there to enjoy the cooking class...",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Best Customer Service Ever! Gorgeous Boutique Hotel.,"The moment we arrived we were greeted by charming Ishmael, brought to the lovely garden patio and given a refreshing beverage. After a brief tour of the facilities, we were taken to our beautiful patio-side room. Tons of windows and a private, large balcony with couch were high points but the Moroccan details and luxury of the room made it superb. This hotel is small but has the amenities of a much larger hotel. Breakfast, either the extensive and delightful poolside buffet or room service, is the best I had in Morocco. Special note: even though our flight out was hours before breakfast is usually served, we received a tray to our room at 4:15 with everything we ordered the night before. Our driver was prompt and delivered us to the airport with perfect timing. The cooking…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Beautiful hotel and restaurant,"This hotel and restaurant in the centre of Marrakech is well worth a visit. As always in old Marrakech the building is entered through an unprepossessing door from an equally unprepossessing. Once inside you are transported into an exquisite, very Arabian building. The restaurant is beautiful with tables outside by the pool area available. The food is excellent and reasonably priced by international standards. The service is good and attentive.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Lovely evening in Marrakech,"A beautifully appointed restaurant in one of the most elegant and welcoming hotels in Marrakech. Maison Arabe does authentic Moroccan cooking in a classical presentation to delicious effect. To start, we shared a mini pastilla trio (three varieties, each with a delicate flaky crust—wonderful) and traditional Moroccan salad of some 10-12 small salads, including spiced carrots, fragrant and tender aubergine, a lively beet medley, quinoa with tomatoes and cucumber, to name only several. I had bites of my dinner companion's dish—a roasted lamb shoulder, which was impossibly tender and delicious, and I had a beef tagine with dates, figs, and apricots. So, so good. The meal was accompanied by the finest live traditional music we heard in Morocco, a vocalist and a guitarist pair that…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Oasis of tranquility in manic Marrakech,"Fantastic Riad hotel that just oozes character and charm, along with the most helpful and friendly staff, ensuring a truly 'magical' experience. The outdoor restaurant surrounding the pool is extremely picturesque and romantic in the evenings with lovely lanterns, candles and live musicians etc. The food is of a high standard, especially from the Moroccan menu, but maybe a touch 'bland' to cater for all tastes. I requested extra spicing which they happily obliged, transforming good dishes to excellent! The Moroccan wine was a complete revelation, good value and highly recommended. The charming Jazz bar cocktail lounge has bags of character, serves great cocktails and the head barman really makes you feel welcome providing exceptional service. The additional 'country club' with…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Amazing Riad in Marrakesh,"My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights in Sept 2015. The experience was nothing less than phenomenal. The staff was amazing, helping set up tours, dinner in several different locations around Marrakesh. The rooms we perfect with great views of both the property and the surrounding city. We also had the opportunity to go to their country club which is off premises (and included). The staff, grounds and pool were excellent and provided and quiet time away from the Medina. If I have the opportunity to go back, I will definitely look to stay here again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,An amazing hotel next to the medina in Marrakech,"We stayed in Morroco in a total of four hotels, and this was probably the best! The room was very comfortable, the meals superb, the location (just outside the medina - 10 minutes walk from Jemaa el Fna) excellent, and the service from the staff was wonderful. At Breakfast we had a wide range of juices (grapefruit, cucumber, beetroot, carrot, orange, lemon), cakes, breads, croissants etc., with cheese and meat as usual. We could also order a Moroccan pancake to be made or scrambled or boiled egg on request. One hint - check that the boiled egg is actually being made - once we had to wait 20 minutes for a 5 minute egg! They had simply forgotten! There are two parts to the hotel - the older and the new. We were in the newer part, but both parts are equally good - but it is quite a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Six Star Staff,"Have just returned from 4 nights at this fabulous read. A wonderful place to stay to really experience Moroccan hospitality. Amazing rooms and good food, but the staff is what particularly makes this an excellent place to stay. Thank you particularly to Rasheed, always greeting us with a smile and one of his delicious concoctions from his jazz bar. We also particularly enjoyed the country club. A little oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the souk and medina. The gardens are beautiful, they grown their own aubergines, chilli peppers, herbs, pomegranates and much more. I didn't take part in the cookery school as was enjoying the sunshine too much after a disappointing summer here, but I will next time. My only negative would be to avoid room 214 as although it looks…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2014,4,Luxury and splendour...,"Beautiful place with amazing spaces, decor and facilities. Fantastic breakfasts - try the filled pancakes. Also, magic of the evening meal next to the pool. All wonderfully lit with candles. And serious musicians too. More formal restaurant lacked character, though sumptuous in features. Moroccan cuisine not really special. Somehow, could almost be a themed-luxurious hotel in another country. Maybe a little too polished in my opinion... Staff intrusively attentive at times, especially at breakfast. Maybe, over-trained and over-anxious to please. After all, they have a reputation to maintain and positions to retain.... Guess, it seemed a little souless to me!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,The staff make this hotel!!,"La Maison Arabe is fabulous! The staff are some of the most organised, friendly and well trained as I have come across. The knew my name from the second I arrived and there was no request they would not try to accommodate. The hotel itself is small and charming with a very cosy feel. Having stayed at several hotels in Marrakech, this one is now my go to hotel. Its not as flashy as some of the big ones but a quaint and memorable experience. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Simply Beautiful!!!,"Well what can I say? From the moment we arrived at La Maison Arabe for our 1st wedding anniversary, it has been a first class experience. Initially I emailed the hotel from London to which they replied immediately arranging our transfers. Upon reaching Marrakech, the driver was already waiting. We were brought to the hotel in a AC mini van, something you'll appreciate once witnessing the heat! We were welcomed by the Manager at the front desk - Adil Chaif. He checked us in early as we arrived before 3pm and gave us some refreshing mint tea and moroccan savouries. Amazing!! Adil explained the details of the hotel and showed us our room, giving us a tour of the hotel. The hotel itself is in an ideal location. It's a 10 min walk to Jami-Fina main square 15 mins to Souks. Also it's…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2015,5,Even better as a Hotel,"Having written a review for the restaurant and being very impressed with the food, I decided to spend my last night in Kech here. I made a last minute booking in person, and a Standard Room was not available . I was upgraded to a Suite for a very modest additional price. The room although a little small is actually really pleasant. On arrival I was given a non alcoholic cocktail and then given a tour of the hotel. This was useful as the hotel son many levels with many corridors. To my mind this all adds to the charm. The decor is traditional Marrakech / Morocco and beautifully executed. The hotel is in an excellent location between the Medina / Souks and the ""new town"" (Gueliz). Everything is in walking distance. The photographs do justice to the hotel. The rooms have…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,A memorable experience!,"On arrival we were greeted very graciously and given the good news of an upgraded suite. A tour of the hotel and its facilities followed a delicious welcoming and refreshing drink of mint, ginger, pineapple juice and limes blended with crushed ice. Our suite was beautifully decorated and everything to make you comfortable was provided. We enjoyed a number of excellent meals in the outdoor restaurant located around the pool and the live music provided by the resident guitarist. Service was exceptional and we found ourselves not wanting to leave! Highly recommended.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Incredible!!,"This beautiful property was everything described in the reviews. The staff is amazing and anticipates your every need.

An unforgettable place!!!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,Fabulous Hotel,"This boutique hotel is a fantastic place to stay. The high level of professionalism of every staff member makes it special and I was so sad to leave. Having lived in Morocco in the past I can truly rate the quality of their spa. Do not miss the opportunity to have a terrific experience and book a Hammam during your stay as not only the place is gorgeous, the therapists really know what they are doing. I was also very impressed with the staff during breakfast. Specially a gentleman called Mohamed which I believe has been there since the opening. One great advantage of La Maison Arabe is that it was there way before the fashion started. Therefore they have highly knowledgeable management beautifully orchestrated by the charming Madame Nabila. She knows everything and everybody in…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2015,5,Excellent Hospitality,"STAFF the staff were hospitable; very accommodating, attentive, and kind FOOD the food was excellent- even if you do not stay in this hotel I would recommend eating here at least once. The menu is written in English and French ROOMS beds were comfortable Bathroom was huge and room was well kept. My only gripe was that coming from the U.S. we needed travel converters to charge our electronics. I would have liked for them to have electric sockets next to the bed, because we had to keep getting up to rotate devices for charging. Another thing that I didn't like- one key per room. So it was horrible having to coordinate between the two of us when we did separate things or having to get up and lock the door and open the door for the other person, because you had to…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,5,La Maison Arabe is one of the best,"The first, and possibly best Ryad in Marrakech. All the beautiful detail of a historic Moroccan home, combined with attentive and friendly staff who make you feel the Four Seasons had something to do with their training. Excellent experience throughout our brief stay, including amazing food, tea and a drink they invented, called a Morojito! Highly, Highly recommend. We went for our 30th anniversary and it was fantastic. Also just a 10 minute walk to the square and the large Souk of Marrakech. Fantastic! We weren't able to take advantage of their offsite pool / garden but it looks like a great respite after traveling across the desert or escaping the heat after a long day walking the city.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2015,4,4.5 stars even with the cons,Excellent hospitality!!! In this bouquet hotel allowing my rating to be 4.5 stars. However there is room for improvement. 1. Only one key is giving per room which makes no sense when the key is needed to lock the room door when your inside and when you leave. NOT TO MENTION A FIRE HAZARD... their way of fixing this issue is to send house keeping to open your door if someone in ur party is left/locked in the room for any reason. beware if you leave you key in the door house keeping won't be able to open it. Simple solution provide 2 keys. 2. breakfast/dinner was good but menu was the same everyday which may be an issue for some travelers 3.

 August 2015,5,Did not want to go home,"Having spent three days in the desert and at the end of a 12-hour drive back to Marrakech, we arrived at La Maison Arabe at 10pm, tired, dirty and very much looking forward to a bit of luxury. We had high expectations, having read all the rave reviews. We were welcomed and taken to the Jazz Bar for a cooling drink, before being given a tour of the hotel and shown to our room. We had booked a standard room, but were upgraded to room 247, a beautifully appointed room with a balcony overlooking the pool and a huge, gorgeous bathroom with corner bath. Complimentary water and a bottle of wine helped to make us feel spoiled right away.

 August 2015,5,A truly exceptional hotel,We ve just arrived back from a fantastic short break at the hotel. The only thing that lets the place down is the website as we really weren't prepared for the quality of the surroundings and level of service that was provided. On arriving we were told that there was a surprise in the room only to be lead to the master suite instead of the room we requested as a free upgrade. Nothing was too much hassle for the staff who were attentive and most accommodating throughout our stay and the use of the country club was phenomenal which again I don't think was sold enough on the website. The hotel is within walking distance to the souks and if you don't fancy a brisk stroll the hotel will organise taxis for you at short notice.

We had dinner at the restaurant and they presented her with a cake, and sang for her and she loved it! The food was fantastic, the flavours lovely! The manager Adil couldn't do enough for us and as were all the staff, we were treated like royalty throughout our stay.

The staff could not have done more for us; they were exceptionally helpful without being intrusive. The location is perfect - all the main sights are within a reasonable walking distance, although taxis are readily available and cheap if preferred.

With that said, to the entire staff at the hotel, Thank you, truly and deeply!

 August 2015,5,Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in!,"After some travelling around western Morocco we decided to spend two nights in La Maison Arabe. To qualify the above title of this review, it is probably worth contextualising that I have, through my occupation, had the chance to regularly stay in some of the best hotels on all continents. I would say that the Maison is possibly my favourite of them all. My barometer requires cultural character, great food and above all else, personal service, and this ticks the box on all fronts. The staff are respectful, knowledgable and attentive. They love their hotel and their employer and this resonates through the work they do.

When we got to the hotel our bags were brought inside and they asked for our passports so that they could check us in while we enjoyed a refreshment in the Jazz bar.

The whole hotel is a journey to discover from the jazz bar, the various rooms, the tea patio, the restaurant / pool area and the spa. Within the spa I enjoyed a very professional Hammam and Massage for a reasonable price. The food in the restaurant was of higher price but of even higher class - marrocan and international cuisine both very fine!

 August 2015,5,A first taste of Morocco,"Having spent the evening in the busy souks of Morocco, La Maison Arabe was a blissful oasis. Whilst the hotel had an authentic feel the restaurant was the reason we came. Situated in an inner courtyard the restaurant is set up around the pool with a superb ambiance. The staff are attentive but not overbearing and the facilities are welcome following the heat and dust of the city. The food is the main attraction and although we only had one course, that was plenty; the portions are very generous. This suited us and all five of us (including a nine year old) were delighted with our respective meals. I highly recommend the lamb. Prices are also very good and it made for a superb evening out in Morocco.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2015,5,Best Hotel in Morocco,"There is a reason this hotel is consistently ranked #1. After a few hours it is obvious why Winston Churchill loved this place. There are no flaws. The moment we arrived in they led us to the Jazz bar, offered us a Mohito (sans alcohol on our part), a wet towel, some nice AC and checked us in right there. They took our bags to the room and gave us a grand tour. The facility is a maze, as it has been retrofitted and expanded over the years. There is a “new” section and “old.” Since we arrived a day early, our suite was not ready the first night, so we stayed in a Junior Suite the first night (old section) overlooking the pool and restaurant.

 August 2015,5,INCREDIBLE!,"I wish that I could go back and lower the score on every hotel I have ever rated on Trip Advisor, in order to give La Maison Arabe the separation between really good and OUTSTANDING Hotels. This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and found it better than home while in Marrakech. Unfortunately our entire family arrived from Fez suffering from an 18 hour stomach / diarrhea issue. During check-in we were offered a refreshing Lime drink from the bar tender Rachid. When told we were sick he showed up in our room 20 minutes later with white rice and a special Moroccan Tea designed to calm the stomach.

 August 2015,5,"Very nice staff, very helpful","We stayed at this hotel for 4 days and have no complaints. It was beautiful, from the rugs in the room, the many many windows, beautiful tiles, breakfast sitting area with the pool view, to the jazz bar. The staff were always near by to answer any questions and were very nice. They clean the rooms in the morning and at night before we would return they would close all the windows and blinds and turn on the AC for us so when we arrived it was nice and cold. There were hand made crepes and the likes for breakfast made by a women in the traditional way. There was smoked fish, cheese, wonderful interesting fruit juices: cucumber mint, beat, carrots and apple etc. There were pastries, fruit, cereal, bread, coffee and tea.

We only stayed here a night at the end of our trip and wished we could have stayed longer. Upon arrival we were shown around the hotel and given a free juice cocktail while waiting for our room (we were a little early for check in). We then were shown to our room, which they were able to get ready early, and it was really stunning - beautifully decorated, big in size, and some really beautiful features. After a short shuttle ride we arrived at the pool - an oasis in the 45 degree heat of Marrakech. Again, we received a free juice cocktail, towels to use and even a straw hat!

The rooms (we had 3) were all wonderful. Very large rooms, big bathroom. Our shower was quite weak however the others said theirs was fine, so it was just the luck of the draw I suppose. On arrival we where ushered into one of the lounge areas and given a local refreshing drink and snack before being shown to our room. We ate in the restuarant twice and it certainly lived up to it reputation. The jazz bar was a fabulous place to enjoy a quiet drink after a long day of touring.

It was the one thing we really wanted to splurge on, and it was definitely worth it! The staff could not do enough for us, our room was lovely (rose petals and a bottle of wine greeted us upon arrival), and the hotel itself was a beautiful oasis in the bustling medina. We took advantage of the pool, country club, spa, hammam, bar, and restaurants. We ate most of our meals at the hotel because the food and service were both so good. But when we wanted to eat somewhere else, the hotel manager made an excellent recommendation and reserved us a table.

The staff are exceedingly helpful and polite The rooms are traditionally furnished and very comfortable. It was exceedingly hot whilst we were here and there is a courtesy bus that takes guests to what is known as the Country Club for a swim in a magnificent pool in a delightful garden setting , complete with attentive waiter service I will certainly recommend this delightful hotel to my friends",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Luxury and impeccable service in the Souks,"Riads are small little boutique hotels in amongst the narrow streets and alleyways around the souks, and so from the outside they don't look much. However from being met at the door the service is absolutely fantastic. They know your name instantly and for the whole visit, a great introductory welcome, nothing is any trouble. The setting is superb and the luxurious decor throughout makes you feel that you are living as a Marracech nobleman may have, a century ago. Breakfasts around the pool are a delight and the Moroccan restaurant fantastic. Must be one of the best places to stay in Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2015,5,The best hotel with the most courteous staff we've stayed so far,"In summary, we can highly recommend La Maison Arabe. The furnishings are beautiful, the architecture is impressive and the amenities (including its own country club) luxurious.

For those interested in details:  STAFF: ALL of them were very helpful and in fact, we have never met so friendly staff in all our travels so far: all of them had a charisma that sowed the perfect combination of courtesy, respect and fun!

 July 2015,5,Visit to Marrakech,"My wife and I stayed at La Maison Arabe for one week while we were on holiday in Morocco. The hotel was excellent, both in terms of location, amenities and quality of food. Staff were extremely courteous and only too willing to help with any questions or to provide information on nearby attractions. Our suite overlooked the pool and had a great balcony to relax on in the evening. We also took in the cooking school that the hotel offered at their second location which is located a short distance away by a shuttle bus provided by the hotel. This was one of the highlights of our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Moroccan cooking. We would definitely stay here again. 5 star accommodation in all respects!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The staff in this hotel are what made our stay so amazing, even during the month of Ramadan the staff where so friendly and helpful. The reception desk staff would stand and welcome you every time you passed, the staff at breakfast and in the bar that served with a smile all round the clock, the porters who seemed like sprinters trying to carry your luggage, the guys at the pool who had a welcome drink and towels ready even before you arrived!!

 July 2015,5,Beautiful Riad,"We stayed for one night in July 2015 since we were short on time and had just spent a few days in the desert. The Riad itself is a little difficult to find, but it is a beautiful place to stay. The rooms are lovely as it the courtyard. The restaurant is very fancy and many diners dressed up for the occasion. The only downside was the wifi in our room which was very slow and the connection was intermittent. Otherwise, we only had good things to say about the Riad. The staff were very courteous and it is located just 15 mins away from the square by foot.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2015,5,Absolutely Amazing!,"My girlfriends and I recently stayed at the hotel for 3 nights to celebrate my 40th Birthday. I have to say it's one of the nicest hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying at it. It really made our trip to Marrakech all that more special. The service we received at the hotel was outstanding. The staff quite literally fall over themselves to help you! All our needs and requests were met, they actually even preempted a lot of needs; booking us into restaurants, organising chauffeurs, etc They even kindly offered us a room to freshen up in before we headed to the airport on the evening of our departure (free of charge!).

The entrance is quite tricky, but as soon as you cross the reception, every detail dazzles you. The rooms are cozy but luxurious. The restaurant is stunning, an atmosphere around the pool, set with live Moroccan music and delighting with exquisite food. We also had the chance to visit the Country Club, a place 15 minutes away from the hotel, whit a swimming pool, beautiful gardens and a kitchen where you can have Moroccan cooking classes. I definitely recommend the cooking class, you can learn the delicious Moroccan dishes as chicken tagine, couscous and pita bread.

Everything was lovely; the room, the pool, the grounds, the hammam, the food, the service - everything. Our three night stay was a delight. The air-conditioning in our room may have been working a little too hard in the heat, as it started to drip water onto one of our suitcases, we told reception about the problem - the air-con was fixed immediately, and the damp clothes were laundered, pressed and returned within a couple of hours. Wish we were back there now.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2015,5,The best of the best,"This was the last stop on our 2 week trip to Morocco and along the way we stayed in several outstanding hotels and riads but La Maison Arabe is in a class of its own. The hotel is beautifully decorated - a mix of traditional Moroccan with updated modern touches that have all the mod cons one expects in a luxury 5 star establishment. But what pushes this hotel into the ""superlative"" category is the attention to detail and the personalized service that each and every staff member we encountered gave to us. Our rooms were upgraded to suites overlooking the pool - a fabulous start! Housekeeping was excellent and our rooms were spotless each time we returned (they seemed to have perfected their timings of when to service the room!).

This is the most beautiful ryad with staff who certainly went above and beyond during our 4 night stay. After welcome drinks in the beautiful courtyard, we were given a tour of the ryad (so much hidden away - we had no idea how big it was!) and then we were surprised with an upgrade to the Royal Suite! And royal we felt! Our suite had 3 levels, including our own private rooftop terrace complete with daybed and spa! The restaurant was amazing and we chose to dine in 3 out of 4 nights, including 2 nights when the musicians were playing (well worth it!). All of the facilities were…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 June 2015,5,stunning,"We stayed at this hotel at the end of our trip in Morocco. We had previously been in Essaouira where it was cooler. When we arrived in Marrakech it was 40 degrees so the temperature took a lot of getting used to. The hotel is just stunning, the restaurant area in the courtyard by the pool is incredibly picturesque and a lovely setting to have breakfast. We didn't unfortunately sample the restaurant food but if the breakfast buffet is anything to go by, i am sure it would be fantastic. Our room was huge and immaculate with a lovely balcony overlooking the courtyard. The staff were incredibly helpful from the moment we arrived, nothing is too much trouble for them.

This riad is a hidden gem, with beautiful decor and in walking distance to main square. The staff were so friendly and welcoming from the moment we arrived. We decided to take a day trip to the Atlas mountains through the hotel and received excellent advice from the front desk.

All in all we could not fault our stay!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2015,5,La Maison Arabe,"I stayed at La Maison Arabe for a total of four nights with my parents. I must say it is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in due to the magnificent rooms and staff. Not only is the location convenient and close to landmarks, the hotel itself is such a gem. The hotel provides free breakfast and afternoon tea, a shuttle to a beautiful private country club with a gorgeous pool, cooking classes, Great spa and their very own store boutique.

The riad was beautiful, the restaurant by the pool was stunning - we had an incredible dinner of very high international standard, and I loved the pool and the sun terrace with loungers. We didn't have time to visit the country club but I felt very comfortable swimming in the riad pool - it is open to guests until 6pm, and another couple also hopped in during the afternoon in the sun. However most noteworthy is the standard of the staff - their attention to detail was second to none, including volunteering to check our flight details, completing our disembarkation cards and packing up a beautiful breakfast for the airport.

 June 2015,5,Why is La Maison Arabe not #1!!!,"Just got back from a two week trip to Marrakesh with my wife and daughter. Our itinerary was 3 nights at La Maison Arabe, a desert trip, return to La Maison for one night then spend 5 nights at the Royal Palm. If we had to change anything about our trip, it would be that we would drop the Royal Palm and stay at La Maison Arabe, again. Why?? the human touch. From the front desk manager Adil, and including Hisham and Moorad they were simply the best. Welcoming us from the moment we got there. Hisham asked, ""Do you like surprises"". With that he took us an unbelievable duplex room with roof terrance. I'm not sure why, but it was greatly appreciated.

There are musicians playing traditional music at both poolside restaurant and their indoor one which serves traditional Moroccan food. Spa is just beautiful! Riad is within walking distance to the great and famous bazaar. Great place to stay! We had to check out early in the morning before 6 where that's their usual time to serve breakfast.

Although situated in the Medina and close to all the interesting sites and the always fascinating Big Squate and souks, the hotel is a haven of peace and luxury. The food is just superb and after trying another restaurant, we decided we'd rather stay in and have our meals beside the beautiful pool. The staff were smilingly attentive and service excellent. Our suite was attractive and super comfortable and the bathroom big and super clean.

 May 2015,5,Utterly delightful small hotel,"If you are an independent traveller this is for you No point in repeating other reviewers' superlatives, but let me make one key point: Marrakech is hot/very hot/sweltering from May to November. There are not so many sights to visit and you will not want to spend all day in the souk. So you need somewhere to relax and this hotel owns a house outside the town, which they use for special events, seminars etc It has a large garden and swimming pool, with food and drink on offer. It is perfect for an afternoon's relaxation. For the rest : all the positive comments are true. Good people, good restaurant, nice rooms.

I've been in many places yet here the hospitality and service hits another level. And on top of that it feels absolutely sincere. Many high end places could take a lesson or two. For instance on our departure day our flight was scheduled in the evening and the hotel gratuitously offered us a suite in the afternoon to shower and fresh up before we left to the airport. And I have many more examples. Furthermore, it's ideally located and breaths an old-school boutique atmosphere, no minimal design but sumptuous authenticity.

 June 2015,5,Perfect Moroccan Riad,"We ended a three location, nine day Moroccan holiday at La Maison Arabe. This hotel truly has everything, a distintive Moroccan feel in a unique building with spacious accommodation (Junior Suite), a busy top rated restaurant, a fabulous courtyard pool and internal gardens and great service. Rashid in the jazz bar also mixes a great cocktail and live music every night. We rated the monkfish tajine as our ""plat du vacation"". If there was a potential flaw, it was lack of outside space to relax in the sun, however when we arrived we found out there is a separate country club with lovely gardens and a large pool, a welcome sanctuary from the Medina.

 May 2015,4,Everything you would expect,"This is more a hotel in the style of a riad in that it has 20 rooms or more and it is really an Americanised/sanitised version of a riad. I don't mean that in a negative way since, as a result, you get excellent customer service and all of the facilities you would expect from a 5 star hotel including a spa/hammam. They also compensate for the limited space within the Medina by having a country club a 15 minute drive away which has a lovely swimming pool and relaxing atmosphere and again first rate customer service. We ate in their Moroccan restaurant where I didn't think the food was that fantastic but we would make that comment about all the meals we had in Marrakech. So, it deserves its very high rating and is actually reasonable value.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,4,Enjoyable,"The hotel is well located right in the medina and an excellent spot to begin exploring the old city. The staff was first rate, helpful and always accommodating. Sadly we had been to Riad Fes first and the food there was beyond AMAZING. Not to say the food at La Maison Arabe was not good, but it did not quite meet the quality as our prior stay. We lucked out and got a suite that was located at the back of the hotel on the top floor. This room was ridiculously nice and HUGE. Bathroom was massive, with a walk-in closet the size of a small bedroom, the bed was very comfortable and the outside terrance was totally lovely.

Be sure to try the lamb with apricots, dates and figs. Try the Saffron tea as well as the famous Moroccan mint tea.They have a very reasonable priced gift shop too.

But it is not a huge place and we enjoyed getting to see parts of the riad that we might otherwise not have seen. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. We enjoyed having outdoor breakfasts featuring fresh Moroccan bread and pancakes grilled to order. The breakfast and restaurant service was excellent as was the service throughout the hotel.

 May 2015,5,"First, but sure not the last time in ""La maison Arabe""","It was our first trip to Marrakech and ""La maison Arabe"" was recommended by our friends. So we expected a nice, little hotel. What a surprise!! This beautiful and amazing Riad was one of the most charming hotels we ever stayed in.The room was big and lovingly furnished, the service was perfect at any time, the dinner was sure the best meal we had in Marrakesh! We also enjoyed the Hammam. So, this was our first, but sure not our last time in ""La maison Arabe""! Marion and Günther, Switzerland",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2015,5,"Perfection, thy name is Maison Arabe","This small beautiful hotel is the incarnation of perfection. Set in a small street in the heart of the Medina of Marrakesh, la Maison Arabe is a haven of calm and luxury. The staff is fluent in many languages and incredibly kind, helpful and competent. We had a gorgeously furnished and spacious room with a balcony overlooking the pool where we could sit and have mint tea with sinful oriental pastries. There was plenty of closet space, and a large and well appointed bathroom with a separate toilet. Breakfast was served around the pool and was a feast for the eyes and the taste. The hotel is centrally located and withinwalking distance from most tourists attractions as well as from the souks. The spa is outstanding and a chance to refresh and be pampered with luxurious and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2015,5,Best night in Marrakech,"After staying at a more standard hotel, we wanted to spend our last night in a riad and so we booked here. We only wish we spent our entire trip here! The service was amazing, the hammam was refreshing, and dinner was the best meal we had in morocco. Beautiful rooms, great internet, and the pre-filled customs card was an excellent touch.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2015,5,We Keep Coming Back,"We live in Casablanca and need breaks from the ""big city."" We recently stayed in a riad property in Tangier. Nice views but it reminded me of all the things about riad visiting i dislike. The following weekend we were in Marrakesh and stayed at La Maison Arabe. Everything was perfect. The harman, a cooking class with my daughter, serval lovely dinners with friends and people we met around the hotel. Our room was charming in the Moroccan way but none of the ""riad"" kitsch and ""why didn't they think of that"" stuff we find at other properties in Morocco. La Maison Arabe is our go to place to relax and enjoy the culture here",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2015,5,Home away from home!,"La Maison Arabe became our home away from home on our recent visit to Marrakech! We were touring this area of Morocco and were fortunate to stay in this exquisite hideaway three times during our two week stay. This magical, small hotel is managed by the most gracious staff we have ever met in all our travels! Each room we stayed in was magnificently appointed and spacious, with a beautiful balcony for enjoying the sunset each evening. The food was the best we had in all Morocco, the service was wonderful and wine pairings were superb. The hammam was outstanding and much needed after the long flight! Breakfasts by the pool were fresh and well done. Each time we returned we were greeted like family. We highly recommend this hotel and will definitely go back!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,"La Maison Arabe is an oasis of calm and beauty in a bustling, colourful city","We highly recommend La Maison Arabe when staying in Marrakech. It is one of the most beautiful and charming hotels that we have ever stayed in. Every glance lands on a beautiful spot in the hotel with its beautiful wood carved wall panels, stairs, balconies, glass, furniture, fire places, light fixtures, etc. The dining area is lovely and the breakfast is an event in itself - home made yogurt with a hint of vanilla, home made breads, omelettes, and lots more. We loved our start to the day sitting under the trees. The staff were excellent - charming, courteous, helpful in every way possible including making recommendations for sight seeing, arranging taxis and tour guides.

 May 2015,5,Happily not trying to rest on trip advisor laurels. Just doing a great job. I'll be back.,What a superb few days here. Approaching from the square is a little apprehensive but from then on in is just the best. 26 rooms which is considered large for a medina hotel but food and service utterly excellent and authentic. The m'semn at breakfast cooked by one of the resident dada was memorable. Have previously stayed in another riad in the medina but this is superior. A trip to the Atlas Mountains well worth the money as was the cookery lesson within the hotel itself. Ate in many places across the medina and outside but maison Arabe the best. In fact some disappointing places to go to if you trust trip advisor. I went by word of mouth. Don't ever forget the old fashioned way of feedback.... Had two bad experiences but won't let that disrupt the review of this place. …,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2015,5,Amazing stay!,"What an amazing place! With top notch service and excellent food, we felt right at home at La Maison Arabe, just better as we didn’t need to clean up nor wash dishes. Apparently, this place started out as a Moroccan restaurant and expanded into a riad, not surprising that it prided itself with its gastronomic offerings, even cooking courses. We reserved the Sinbad suite for our family of three and were extremely pleased with the size and amenities. The separate living space was easily converted into a small bedroom for our five-year-old daughter and she was ecstatic to have her own little nuke. As we arrived early in the morning and our suite was not yet ready, the staff even prepared a room for us to relax and freshen up. Located inside the walled city of Marrakesh, the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,4,Nice touches but too Western for our tastes,"The layout of the hotel is part of its charms as is the service. It can be a bit of a struggle to remember the way to your room and to breakfast on the first couple of tries. There's a lively bar, beautiful interiors and breakfast by the pool but it just doesn't compare to a riad. The room's, although beautifully appointed, are very similar to hotels all over the world. That may be exactly what you're looking for but as I like something a little more intimate and in the centre of activity in the Medina",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Enchanting hotel with absolutely wonderful staff,"We're just back from a four nights here. We arrived at the hotel by car transfer, (which the hotel very kindly arranged for us) and were greeted by the nicest reception staff we have ever met. Our bags were taken to our room and we were shown to the lounge for an evening welcome drink and snack of olives, nuts and small crackers. It was lovely after a long flight and even longer queue at passport control. We were then shown around the beautiful hotel and to our wonderful room with its own little privet terrace. The rooms are a really lovely size, bathroom also a good size with nice toiletries and rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom. Lovely touch. Dinner was very kindly reserved for us in the pool side international/Moroccan restaurant, we both had the traditional…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 April 2015,5,The best hotel we have stayed in,"We were met at the airport by the hotel's driver, and was transferred to the hotel in a Mercedes minibus. When we first arrived at the street in front of the hotel, I was having second thoughts as this was supposed to be a 5 starred hotel. We were escorted down an alley way with grave concerns. When we entered the hotel, it was something totally unexpected. We were escorted to an atrium and was given a chance to relax. The Morroco-hitos are very good and refreshing. Whilst we were relaxing with our mocktails, checking in was done and our luggage was taken to our room. Adil (front desk manager) showed us around the communal areas of the hotel before escorting us to our room. Every part was beautifully decorated, and immaculately maintained. There was no dust on anything (I did…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 April 2015,5,Exceptional Riad,"One of the most wonderful places we have stayed in, I work in the travel industry and we are very fortunate to travel the world, I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this property. La Maison Arabe is exceptional, the standard of service, hospitality, and the dining experience is all excellent, rooms are incredibly comfortable and exquisitely furnished. The combination with the Country Club works very well, so wonderful to escape for the afternoon and relax by the pool and receive the continuous flow of high service standards. I really am repeating what others have written! No doubt it will be repeated again and again and deservedly so!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Outstanding hotel-exceptional service,"So many positive comments have been made about this hotel and they are all true. We had five wonderful nights here and cannot speak too highly of the general ambience of the hotel, splendid country club and very good food. However, what most distinguishes this hotel is the exemplary service from all staff whatever position they are in. Thanks to all for providing such a memorable stay.We will be back!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Amazing!! As simple as that...!!!,This well known place in Marrakech is a real jewel in the medina. We spend a day at the spa (Merhaba package) and afterwoods had lovely lunch by the pool. The spa is perfect for a relaxing day and hideaway from a hectic day in the city. The tables by the pool are perfect for finishing the day off with nice dinner or snack. For sure will be back.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

In addition, it has a country club with large swimming pool and restaurant that provides a simple but very good menu",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Fantastic cooking class,"Three of us attended the cooking class offered by La Maison Arabe. Prior to leaving for the cooking class we enjoyed Moroccan tea served to us in the area around a lovely fountain at the hotel. Had we seen this boutique hotel before booking a timeshare in Marrakech we would have stayed here. The hotel is stunningly beautiful. The actual cooking class takes place outside the city and has a lovely garden. The cooking class was intended to be a special present for my husband. It turned out to be one of my favorite activities of the entire three week trip in Morocco. The woman, who taught the class, spoke excellent English and we learned a lot about the Moroccan culture by taking this class. The class started with a tour of the herb garden and a demonstration on how to bake…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Second stay as excellent as first visit in January,"I stayed at La Maison Arabe in January with our grown up daughter and we had an amazing stay. This time I visited with my husband and everything was as enchanting and perfect as before. The hotel is beautiful - every aspect of it and immaculately decorated and maintained. The rooms are so comfortable, every member of staff is utterly welcoming and efficient and the food is second to none, both the pool side breakfast and the two restaurants. The country club is a wonderful place to relax in the afternoon after a morning of sightseeing and shopping. We will definitely return as this is a magical place. Thank you to Adil and all the staff.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Excellent riad in the heart of the medina,"Had a great five nights here at the end of March. The room I had was large, comfortable and quiet (far from the madding crowd outside). Beautifully decorated with a large bed and rose petals everywhere to impress the missus. Service was exceptional. A free bottle of wine on arrival plus free refreshing drinks, free bottled water for our excursions - which the hotel helped us to arrange - we went on two separate day-trips, one to the Atlas Mountains and another to Ait Benhaddou. Our driver spoke good English and was able to tell us a lot about the history and locations - the car was a spacious, clean and new Toyota Landcruiser (the excursions cost £90 and £150 respectively). The riad itself is decorated in the traditional Moroccan style and finishing is to a high standard. …",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Amazing restaurant and service,"My wife and I were on holiday in Marrakesh. I decided to pre-book La Maison Arabe after reading positive rumours about it. We were not dissapointed - food was excellent, entertainment was excellent and service was excellent. If we visit Marrakesh again, then we will surely stay at this hotel with it's lovely taste for food.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Amazing hotel and staff - one of the best I have ever stayed in.,"Last year we went to La Maison Arabe and were totally enchanted by the hotel, its staff and the town of Marrakech. So if we went a second time would it really be as good as we remembered - could it possibly be as wonderful again? The answer is a resounding 'yes'. The fabric of the hotel is truly magical - with a wonderful balance between ancient charm and modern facilities. We had a Junior Suite with a balcony overlooking the small pool and restaurant. Only having 23 rooms give the hotel a real intimate and friendly atmosphere. It is close enough to the centre of the town to be able to walk to the main historic sites. Walking through Marrakech is a true joy, the architecture and atmosphere are superb - it is very different from European cities. Providing you are able to say 'no'…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,What a gem!,"This hotel exudes old world charm with highly trained, charming and helpful staff from the front desk to the people who clean your room. Everyone not only remembers your name but your room number, your drink preference. Nothing is too much for anyone who works in this Riad. If you are considering a trip to Marrakech, this is the place to stay. The husband of our travel companions has been sick with tourists probably picked up from food in another part of the country and the hotel could not have been better, from special medicinal tea to supplying Imodium and daily follow up. Way above and beyond! The rooms are great and the food in the restaurants some of the best that we have had in Morocco. breakfast is also wonderful with an assortment off rush fruit etc.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,The Most Breathtakingly Magical Place We Have Ever Stayed !!,We have just come back from this amazing country and this Riad is outstanding and by far the best 5 star accommodation we have ever stayed in! The original features have been magnificently restored and the ambiance is amazing. Our suite was magnificent and beautifully decorated. We ate at both the main restaurant and the pool side restaurant - both of which have delicious food and local musicians playing traditional music and both these really should be tried. We took the cookery class which was so much fun and in the stunning surroundings of the La Maison country club. and used the hammam facilities which are truly beautiful . The location is perfect in a lovely quite lane yet walking distance from the soul of the city ie the souks and the historic landmarks such as Ben…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Wow,Enjoyed an amazing 5 nights here. Great to be so close to everything. Only 10 minutes to Medina and you are in the Souk. It's an oasis of calm and as previous reviews have noted the staff are brilliant and so helpful and friendly. We had a room with terrace overlooking the pool. The only downside was the call to prayer at 4.30 am from the nearby Mosque but we got used to it and it added to the whole experience. The breakfasts were amazing with lots of fresh fruit and hot and cold options. The fresh Moroccan crepes were fab. If you want quality accommodation in a totally relaxed and non corporate environment this is the place for you. We also went to their own country club on the outskirts of the city which has a fabulous pool and offers lunch. Hope we can return some…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2014,5,Wonderful,"This is perhaps our favourite hotel our family has ever stayed at. The rooms were gorgeous and huge, clean bathrooms too. The public areas were beautifully decorated as well - the lanterns are gorgeous. The poolside lounge area and restaurant were nice for lounging. If we had one negative it was that the pool was not heated and was icy cold in spring, so my kids could not swim, but they sure tried! Location is excellent and near enough to the main square to walk. It is very quiet except for the call to prayer at 5:00 am, but that's Morocco! We also ate at the restaurant 2 nights in a row. We weren't going to, but the first night it was so good that we went again. Try the lamb dish with lemons - my husband swears I licked the plate. He and the kids also enjoyed the chicken…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Perfection in the Medina,"First, I must admit that due to some kind of error we were upgraded to the royal suite. All I can say is you need to hope this error happens to you too. The room consisted of a main floor with two twin beds, a full bath, couches and a desk, an upper balcony with a king bed and full bath and a private roof top terrace (with hot tub). Rose petals were everywhere when we arrived and they were gone when we went to bed. There were heated towel racks, showers and baths in the bathrooms and a nespresso maker in the living room. Enough said... The hotel is a warren of rooms due to the fact that it is several buildings that have been combined, but each is lovely and warm. The staff was exceptionally kind and welcoming, my only complaint being that at breakfast each day it took them a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,An oasis of cool calm in a hot busy city,"Personally I don't think this hotel can be bettered. Immediately you enter you become aware of the cool calm atmosphere of this beautiful place. Our room was lovely, with an outside balcony and everything we could possibly need, scattered liberally with rose petals. After being greeted by the very friendly reception staff on arrival, we were given a welcome drink in one of the many areas available to sit and relax in. Then a tour of the facilities - the restaurants and bar, the pool, and the wellness centre - before being shown to our room. This was followed by complimentary afternoon tea and pastries by the pool. In the evening there are musicians in each of the eating areas. We ate in the Moroccan restaurant and the food was so good that we ate far too much. The tagines…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Luxury Boutique Hotel/Riad with Great Service,"La Maison Arabe very nicely splits the difference between a riad and a luxury hotel. The service is very friendly and helpful, but the hotel has excellent facilities, including a beautiful hammam, that tend to come with larger luxury hotels. We really appreciated the nice car that they provided to take us to Essaouira. Our room was a junior suite overlooking the pool, which is stunning at night. The hotel is within the medina, but not in the heart of it. It is nicely removed from some of the chaos. I will say that the food prices were far too high at the hotel. I do not like to gripe over pricing, but we paid New York prices for food, and that is too much in Morocco. (The cooking class is also too expensive.) I will say that the food is excellent at the hotel's two…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 April 2015,5,Excellent,"The hotel is full of character and positioned in the medina so location wise you will need to keep an open mind, it is not so obvious in terms of curtsied appeal. having said that the hotel itself is very nice, traditional and comfortable. The outstanding feature of the hotel is the standard of service which was really very good by any standards I have experienced - friendly and courteous without being formal or stuffy. The staff provided afternoon tea and wonderful traditional biscuits which made for a relaxing and cosy afternoon. It was cold during my stay so despite the sun you need some warm layers. We tried the country club which was charming and the staff there equally as polite and attentive, the pool there is lovely and the gardens very nice. The cookery class was fun…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Decor and Ambience are Amazing,"A group of fourteen friends stayed four nights at La Maison Arabe during the first week of March. We have traveled all over the world and would put this hotel right at the top of our list of favorites. The hotel is French owned and is furnished with beautiful antiques and everything is designed for comfort. There are only 26 rooms, I believe, and they are all spacious suites. Ours had a living room. large bedroom, very modern bath, and a private balcony with bougainvillea blooming on it. We thought the food and the service were outstanding. We highly recommend La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,4,A beautiful haven from all the hussle and bussle,We stayed here in March enjoying all that this fabulous place could offer but after four days felt ready to move on to the Atlas mountains for peace and tranquility. None-the-less we had fantastic food here and hammam was absolutely fantastic. The staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful especially the man on reception who gave us lots of good advice. My one quibble would be the fact we were charged for the coffee we made in our own room. I have never had this charge in any other hotel I have ever stayed in and felt it was rather 'penny-pinching'.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,Bliss,"We stayed in February when temperatures were expected to be about 14 degrees but the skies were cloudless and it was possible to eat outside with heaters moved to wherever our hearts desired if necessary or just by being sheltered in the lovely suntrap terraces. It really was the most wonderful hotel I have ever experienced. The staff were delightful, smiling,welcoming and thoughtfully provided every service with great professionalism and without being obsequious.

 March 2015,5,Wonderful and Luxurious experience in the heart of Marrakech,I stayed at La Maison Arabe in March with my sister as a treat for her birthday and had a wonderful time.

 April 2015,5,BEAUTIFUL WELL LOCATED HOTEL WITH GOOD RATES AND NICE STAFF,"Hotel is outstanding, nicely decorated in every corner. The ammenities and the room are perfect. Best Riad in Marrakech for sure. Beautiful restaurants, nice bars and patios. The manager is always helpful. price is more than fair, for a place as nice as this. One tip though- make sure you stick to the check out time, they value the incoming constumers as much as the outgoing ones. Will definitely stay here next time. Highly recommended.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,Amazing property inside the Medina,This hotel is absolutely beautiful. It is Morocco at it's finest. They also have a property in the country which is also lovely.

 April 2015,5,The best riad in Marrakech,"This is my umpteenth visit to Marrakech and I've stayed in lots of different hotels and other riads. But La Maison Arabe is very special. Firstly, the staff are excellent - from the booking experience to the welcome - this is service of an extraordinary standard. Some of the carpets are getting a little tired (stairwell to the pool) but it all adds to the authenticity. It really is a beautiful, vast riad that is made up of several riads that have been combined over the years. It was good to see the same faces as it's been two years since I last stayed here and the staff are still the same. I had a cough on arrival but was promptly supplied with a ginger and herbal concoction to cure my ills. You have to have a hammam! This is the best it gets in Marrakech - outstanding. Can't…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2015,5,We only ate in the restaurant but.....,"It was fantastic. A real high point of our culinary visit to Morocco. It started out with a delicious fig/olive tapenade and carrot orange soup, progressed to a fantastic monkfish tagine and chicken with preserved lemons and olives tagine. Everything was delicious and so richly flavorful, and the setting by the pool was incredible. Out only regret was we didn't come every night for dinner, and if it hadn't been our last night we certainly would have. The server was the sweetest and most attentive, and I could kick myself that I can't remember his name, but I did compliment him to the manager. I asked if it was possible to get any of their recipes and he brought me out a calendar/recipe book that I will certainly be using. I wish I could go back tonight.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2015,5,Beautiful building and lovely staff,"The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from the Souk. The entrance is off a typical bustling Marrakech street but as soon as you turn into the surprisingly clean and wide ""alley"" leading to the hotel you get a sense that you are about to enter a peaceful Oasis. The hotel does not disappoint. The hotel, as its name alludes to, is a large luxurious arab style house. The decor combined with the very friendly and attentive service it made us feel like we were guests being welcomed into the house of a Marrakech nobleman. After being served mint tea and some interesting juice drinks we were taken to our room. We were upgraded to a large suite which was very tastefully appointed and even had a private verandah!

I was a little concerned when our hotel taxi service arrived at an alleyway and got our bags out. la Maison Arabe is situated down an alleyway , the approach totally belies what lies behind the facade .The staff from start to end were friendly courteous and efficient. We were in a junior suite which had a large terraced balcony overlooking the outside restaurant. It was extremely comfortable. As was my bed. The restaurant in the hotel was really reasonably priced and the food delicious. The staff were attentive and could not do enough to ensure we enjoyed a good dinning experience with them.

 March 2015,5,A true 5 star experience,"We stayed at La Maison Arabe, located in the Medina close to the Souks and night market, for 3 nights while we enjoyed the sights, sounds and activities of Marrakech. The hotel is elegant, comfortable, quiet and without a doubt one of the nicest places I have stayed anywhere. We were upgraded to a wonderful suite (room 218) that had a living area, a separate bedroom, a private outdoor courtyard and a separate alcove sleeping area that our daughter used. We were surprised to discover that so much was included in what we first thought was a small Riad hotel, including a marvelous hamam spa, two excellent restaurants and a bar, all with live music, as well as a swimming pool surrounded by a courtyard, restaurant and cooking school. The staff were very friendly and attended to our…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,No 1 Riad in Morocco,"We stayed in room Ziad for 3 nights which was probably one of the less expensive rooms. We slept under a brick dome ceiling which was beautiful. The hotel staff were so kind to both of us especially when my husband had a cold. They organised for him to have a special drink to help with his cold which consisted of honey, limes, cumin, ginger and cinnamon (plus other secret ingredients) and it worked a treat. The riad was an oasis of calm and sophistication. The location was perfect for seeing the medina and souks and only 10 mins walk to the famous square. Breakfast was excellent. We stayed in 3 riads in Morocco and this was our favourite.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Can't imagine a better experience,"Spent a week at the Maison Arabe, and this proved to be a high point of our entire visit to Morocco. Its entry is extremely discreet and understated on an unassuming side street. Behind that entry lies an absolute jewel of a hotel. Impeccable taste distinguishes each room, the scale is perfect, and the location leaves the guest within easy walking distance of the Souk. Not that you'd ever want to leave the hotel. Two lovely restaurants, a wonderful hamam, pool, bar...They have thought of everything. What really distinguishes the Maison Arabe though is its hospitality, spontaneous and genuine, on the part of everyone on staff. I have never been made to feel so welcome, so genuinely at home.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Splendour Marrakech style,"This is a truly beautiful hotel within the Medina. Lots of nooks and crannies to explore. Gorgeous furniture and carpets. As it was my birthday, we were upgraded to a 3 storey de luxe suite with our own roof garden and guest bathroom. Wonderfully attentive staff who give a mobile phone so that they can come and rescue you if you get lost in the medina!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,"Very friendly house with style and atmosphere, best location to visit the Medina","House with charme, style and atmosphere, very friendly and helpful staff, wonderful breakfast buffet around the swimming pool, a nice place to eat outside even when it's raining.

 March 2015,5,"Unpretentious, friendly luxury","We stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate my 50th. It was just lovely. The service was friendly and unbelievably helpful, the atmosphere quiet and relaxed, and the room we had (Sindhbad, number 11) quiet and comfortable. The location is perfect for the souks and sightseeing. We ate at the Moroccan restaurant on our first night, the food was excellent. We struck some great weather so headed out to the country club a few times - really relaxing, and the same friendly, quiet atmosphere. A perfect place for a luxury break, and highly recommended.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,"Wonderful, amazing hotel and experience! The best!","Beautiful, beautiful, charming hotel. The hotel has many nooks and crannies and is everything I had hoped for. We had the Jaafar suite which was breathtaking and charming. Huge bathroom with separate shower and tub, toilet area and double vanity and sinks. Separate living room, interior terrace, another side area, long hallway, the suite was very large and spacious. The Jazz Bar in the hotel was very well designed, and had a very comforting, relaxing atmosphere. Staff from check-in to check-out took care of you very well. Breakfast is included and was very healthy, plentiful and fresh. Two restaurants so no need to traverse back into the old medina after a day of touring when excellent restaurants are available at the hotel. I wish I was at the jazz bar right now.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Our Oasis in Marrakech,"A truly outstanding hotel!! Absolutely exceptional service along with such friendliness from the staff, nothing was too much trouble. We were upgraded to the best suite in the hotel which was a lovely surprise and provided us with excellent comfort and as other guests have commented the decor, atmosphere and ambience was so Moroccan along with wonderful breakfasts and dinners what more can I say except a truly wonderful Oasis !!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2015,5,Just excellent and great care for details,"SERVICE is spelt in Capital letters and applies absolutely everywhere in this Hotel. DINNERS and BREAKFASTS were awesome. Delicious food was served by very friendly staff. ROOMS are luxurious, furnished with good taste and express with their refinement true Arabic hospitality. The same applies for the decoration of all other parts of this Riad, i.e. for the lounges, restaurants and other common facilities. A truely quaint, romantic and cosy place to be, a place we can really recommend ! ... and - cherry on the cake - was receiving from the reception at the check-out the already fully filled imigration forms for the airport To Management and Staff of La Maison Arabe, Marrakech, thank you for our two wonderful stays we certainly wll treasure in our memories.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,The Epitome of Service and Luxury in the heart of Marrakech,"We had a wonderful 4 nights in this high quality hotel in the Medina of Marrakech. There is much to compliment the high standards which are provided by this 5 Star Hotel. This memorable experience began as soon as we arrived at the hotel reception area- our room was given a free upgrade to a suite, with an adjoining private courtyard & seating area!! The Fine Dining experiences provided at both the 'Morrocan' and 'Les Trois Saveurs' restaurants were exceptional, with the excellent choices of local cuisine and a high standard of service. We did not dine at the Piano Bar during our stay, but this also was a bar area of high ambiance and quality. Breakfast was served by the poolside, with an excellent selection of local juices, breads, fruit and freshly cooked eggs and crepes!!…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Wonderful beef tagine,"We spent 5 days in Marrakech and had a wonderful lunch at La Maison Arabe. For me, it was the best beef tagine I had on our trip- which includes the very expensive restaurant at La Mamounia. Service was prompt and attentive; the setting was poolside and beautiful; it was a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the medina.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Dinner was awesome,"We visited here on recommendation from our friends and what a good choice! We started off at the Jazz bar and with some drinks and olives and nuts on the house. The best okives I have ever had! The staff are lovely, and impeccable service. It was a cool night but we sat out side near the pool with the heaters. The food was fabulous! Recommend it to anyone!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Five star luxury in the medina,"We stayed here four nights, eating at the Jazz bar and also the Morroccan restaurant, as well as the complimentary breakfasts and afternoon teas. We took the complimentary shuttle to the country club, and my wife had a massage in the hammam. Everything was pretty faultless. The food in particular was superb -- I'd be surprised if you could get better in Marrakech. Nice that you can get this quality of accommodation and food inside the medina. When you step out of the hotel entrance you are right in the thick of the rabbit warren of alleys that lead to the souks, though it's only a short walk to the nearest taxi-friendly road. Maybe a little less authentic than some of the central riads, but it's nice to have a pool you can swim in. Hard to complain about the country club, as…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Perfect setting and great food and atmosphere,"We dined at the International Restaurant at la Maison Arabe to celebrate a special occasion while visiting Marrakech. We chose the International Restaurant as there was a large group dining in the Moroccan Restaurant that evening. This information was provided to us when we visited the hotel earlier that day. When inquiring about making a reservation for the restaurant, we were treated to a full tour of both restaurants, as well as the kitchen where open cooking classes take place, and also the spa, where you can book a hammam and massage for 650dirham. The International Restaurant exquisitely encircles a courtyard pool, which provides for a very romantic ambience with ornate candlelight and traditional Moroccan musical accompaniment. The setting was perfect and the service was…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,"Luxury, an oasis of tranquility in Marrakech","Great rooms, excellent service. It is a high scale oasis inside the busy Marrakech caos.

Make sure you call them to book with a lot of anticipation, they are always full.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Fab week in Marrakech,"Fantastic week in Marrakech at this wonderful hotel. Superbly located, beautiful rooms, excellent food and possibly the best service I've ever experienced. Thanks team for all your hard work. My only gripe is the disturbed sleep because of the call to prayer, not that they could do much about that - apart, maybe, from earplugs.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Wonderful stay,"Stayed two nights in this delightful hotel. Started by being taken into a lounge area and given a refreshing drink. Just nice to have something different than the usual mint tea. The hotel arranged a guide at a very reasonable price, Abdul (Abderrahmane Belmoudden) which made it lot easier to get around the first day. Would highly recommend letting them arrange a guide on the first day in Marrakech. The service and staff were excellent. The breakfast buffet by the pool is lovely and was a nice change from most of the riads. Enjoyed the piano- jazz bar. The drinks and the music were excellent. Eat at Les Trois Saveurs one evening which was very good but not as good as Gastro MK. Hope to be back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Unforgettable weekend in a beautiful oasis,"Staying at La Maison Arabe for our wellness weekend among 5 friends was the best choice ever. Discovering this authentic jewel in the narrow streets of the Medina was even better than the excellent reviews could describe. We were suddenly transported into another world, a pleasure for all senses, with attention to detail in every corner. The architecture, authentic design and decorations are stunning. We stayed in the Royal Suite which was amazing, spacious and with a private terrasse. The welcome and service was excellent, (thanks so much for the welcome bottle!) everyone was very friendly, with smiling faces and most helpful. The spa is beautifully decorated with majestic lamps and the traditional hammam was a unique experience followed by a fantastic massage. The…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Sweet Perfection,"Service in this beautiful hotel, where each room is unique and the atmosphere happy, respectful and friendly, is shown in small but multiple acts of kindness. La Maison Arabe management could teach most European hotels a tremendous amount about how to train their staff to be unobtrusive but still enhance the client's experience and serve their needs.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,"Top notch accommodation, but retains character and colour","There are, I'm sure, more expensive, glossier hotels in Marrakech. But, I doubt any can compare to the experience enjoyed at Maison Arabe. The accommodation itself is faultless. The rooms are highly equipped, forensically clean, comfortable and decorated to a high standard. We experienced two rooms - one for the duration of our stay and one for a late check out. Both were of a very high standard. The food is wonderfully Moroccan, with tagines, chicken and couscous being firm favourites. The bar has a jazz pianist some evenings and Rachid, the head barman, will ply you with cocktails to your heart's content. But it is the service which sets this place above others. The attention from staff is second to none (and without any obsequiousness). Adil Chaif, the front…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Exquisite riad and phenomenal service!,This is the third time I have had a group at La Maison Arabe and the fourteen of us were there for four nights.

Thank you for an absolutely wonderful four nights.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Excellent food and great atmosphere!,"It is wise to make a reservation here, but because we we're early we had a table. We had the best tajines in a week and the good service, excellent food and nice atmosphere made us come back another day in the one week we we're in Marrakech. It's also a hotel and a Spa.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,A real oasis,"This was an excellent hotel on all counts and a wonderful place to come back to after spending the day in busy, bustling Marrakech. Room we were in was large and very comfortable. The riad generally was very well appointed and the food was good. The riad is close to the action of the city. The staff were helpful and very pleasant. we would certainly recommend La Maison Arabe to others.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,A 5* Riad with a personal touch,"My husband and I stayed at La Maison Arabe at the end of Feb/early March for a week. As well as a city break and some sun, we needed a much needed chance to recharge our batteries and the Riad ticked all the boxes. I booked directly and my emails were answered quickly. I had asked for a couple of items which were not standard in the rooms and when we arrived they were already there. Adil was always friendly and nothing was too much trouble for him! Afternoon tea was served every day anywhere you liked and believe me there are lots of different places to have it! When we first arrived it seemed like a maze of little rooms but it added to the character. The decor was amazing and turning day into night was done with taste. We booked a deluxe garden room which was on the second…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,A Hotelier's Viewpoint,"Who could have thought that down this uninspired lane there was such an inspired hotel. There was a real ""soul"" to the riad - the staff went out of their way to make you feel wanted without being patronising. The Restaurants were great! And, unless you knew La Maison's 'hidden secret' you would never have found the Country Club. What an amazing hideaway. We more or less had this to ourselves - a great pool, bar, snacks and a haven of peace and quiet. There were so many positives about the hotel - too numerable to mention; we didn't find any negatives. Our first trip to Morocco and this riad made it memorable. Thank you to all.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,"Truly wonderful hotel, I can't recommend it enough","I stayed here for a week in February and had an excellent time. The staff were incredibly attentive, for example on the first morning I ordered a large black decaf coffee with my breakfast, the following morning they greeted me by name and asked if I would like a large black decaf coffee. They also noticed that I walked with a limp and on my third day they said that a room without stairs had become free and asked if I would like them to upgrade me to that room free of charge. I left my key with reception when I went out and when I got back they had moved all my stuff for me. One night I ate at a restaurant outside the hotel and not only did the doorman walk me to the restaurant so I didn't get lost but they also gave me a mobile phone programmed with the hotel's number so I…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2015,5,Fabulous hotel,"My family have just enjoyed a fabulous 4 night stay in the Royal Suite with Roof terrace & spa bath... (well worth the extra). It was my wife’s 60th birthday treat & the service was exceptional throughout....nothing was too much trouble for the staff from arranging birthday photographer, spa treatments & transport to places of interest. Dining was a enjoyable & interesting delight. We were lucky enough to have great weather in early March & enjoyed the facilities of the Country Club including the exceptional Cooking School. This is a hotel that we will definitely return to. Well done & thank you to all at La Maison Arabe",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,Probably one of the best places I have ever stayed,With only 26 rooms and suites you can tell. The service and staff were unbelievable. We had the cheapie room compared to what you could have paid but apart of the square footage it made no difference to the stay. My room is the only think I had any fault with. The breakfast was excellent as was the courtesy shuttle to the out of town swimming pool lounge area. Will definitely stay again.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,make sure you use the Hammam,"There has been lots written on Trip Advisor about this stunningly lovely, friendly and unostentatiously luxurious riad-style hotel. As a very frequent traveller, I'm often a bit cynical... but this place really delivers, and there's nothing I would improve. Highlights are these; The staff, who are unfailingly courteous, helpful, interested, polite, and anxious to ensure that you have all that you might need. The rooms, we overlooked the central (heated) pool in the middle of the building/s with a view of the nearby mosque. It was wonderful, fresh flowers and fruit, a huge and comfortable bed... every small luxury you can imagine. The Hammam.... not something that would be ""my thing"", but I went with my wife.

 December 2014,5,Wonderful Hotel/Riad,"My husband and I stayed at La Maison Arabe for 4 nights in December while on a 3+ week tour of Morocco. This was a fabulous riad away from the bustling medina, but within close proximity. While the lobby was modest, our room which was a suite, was wonderful. It overlooked the pool and had a large balcony which we used to relax in the late afternoon after sight seeing. The service was first rate. The manager of the bar made great drinks and was very personable and warm clearly proud of his job. Each morning we were greater by a welcoming staff who made certain everything at breakfast was to our liking. One night we had dinner in their Moroccan restaurant and it was excellent with great service.

 February 2015,5,"Great hotel, lot of charme and a bit on italian touch","We (family of 3) stayed in La Maison for four days mid-February and everything was perfect. The Riad is well placed for all the amenities -casbah, place Jamaa-el-Fna, main buildings, museums and Mosques- but in a calm and peaceful corner just outside the bustle of the city. Starting from the car at the airport everything has been irreproachable: the check-in very fast, desk personnel efficient and very gentle, other personnel (from the cleaning ladies to the waiters as well the porters) always impeccable. Our patio suite very spacious, clean, well equipped (though we missed a phone dock for some music) with a lovely small fitted patio where to enjoy a cigarette under the stars.

 February 2015,5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"There are some beautiful hotels in the world. Then there is Maison Arabe. Its in a class of its own. The building is charming having been built by converting 6 riads and adding a new extension whilst maintaining the character of the original. However, what sets this hotel above all others we have stayed in (including Palazzo Sasso and Le Manor aux Quart Saisons) is the fantastic staff. Nowhere have we met such dedicated and friendly staff who go out of their way to help ensure that your stay is the best it can be. The two hotel restaurants were superb and very good value for the quality and all the waiters ensured that our daughter had no nuts in anything she ate (due to her severe nut allergy) The hotel manager is very friendly and makes guest feel very welcome.

We were upgraded to two beautiful suites and were made to feel immediately welcome. The Moroccan restaurant served delicious food, as does the international one, and the breakfast is very special. Various Moroccan pancakes are made to order, as are egg dishes and there is a huge selection of all sorts of delicious things. The pool was sadly not heated during our stay (end of February) but there is the opportunity to go to the country club 15 mins away to spend time at the pool. I cannot emphasise enough how special the staff are. They were charming, observant, welcoming, always at hand and took great care of our children.They gave us all possible support and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,"A place of stylish calm, amidst the madness of Marrakech!","I'm so glad many other reviews of La Maison Arabe were really good - this place deserves them and it certainly helped my decision to stay there. My wife and I stayed for 4 nights at the end of February and we had a most enjoyable stay. There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said in other reviews but like those, I would agree, the place is simply stunning. The hotel is ideally situated from the main square and the souks (about a 10/15min walk) and it was just so nice to come back to a beautiful place after some dusty days walking. The owner has made a great job at blending the old part with the new and maintaining that rustic but sytlish Morrocan feel.

 February 2015,5,As good as the reviews say,"Just returned from a long weekend visit to La Maison Arabe. The hotel is pricier than others but well worth the extra money. It's in an excellent location about 10 mins walk from all the action but far enough away to provide respite from the tourist spots. We stayed in a room in the old part rather than over the pool area. Our room was great- large with its own patio area. I am sure the pool ones would be good too, but the pool area is the hub of the hotel, providing the restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner so I expect it might be noisy if you are an early to bed person. The pool area is very scenic though and you would get a view which we didn't have in our room.It was our first visit to Marrakech and the experience in the souks and walking on the roads with all the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,4,Quite beautiful a little pricey,"Lovely hotel in a great spot to visit the city. The restaurants are excellent albeit the price is more or less what you would expect in a nice place in Europe. Spa treatments are really quite good as well, yet, once again, not cheap (the access to the hamman is not for free and must be reserved). Lots of stairs, so those who have mobility issues should think twice. Reception and staff are extremely helpful though the restaurant is quite slow (it took over half an hour to have a sandwich)... No early checkin (we arrived at 11.30 and had to wait till exactly 2.00 before getting our rooms) and I strongly advise doing the checkout the evening before departure if you have an early flight.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,Outstanding hotel,"The staff were wonderful, nothing was too much trouble. All the meals we had were excellent and our room was beautiful. The whole hotel was clean and welcoming, with open fires in the public areas to take the chill off in the evening. The courtyard was a wonderful place for a cup of mint tea in the afternoon. It was an easy walk to the main square and souks. A guide is definitely recommended for visiting the souks or for a trip into the foothills of the Atlas mountains. A lovely few days away from the British winter.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights at this fantastic oasis of well-run calm in a hectic and challenging city. It's bigger with better facilities than a normal Riad but smaller than a chain hotel. The staff did everything, and more, to make the stay an enjoyable one and, from the moment we got there, we felt like we were being looked after by old friends. It was a cold spell during our stay but the hotel was always warm, with enough eating-in space as well as lots of heaters for outdoor dining too. Our room overlooked the pool and was large, well-equipped with a nice bathroom. Room service was efficient and totally unobtrusive.

 February 2015,5,A lovely place to retreat to,"We recently stayed here and thoroughly enjoyed it. Many positives, 1 or 2 negatives. The staff from manager to housekeeper were friendly, courteous and happy to assist at every opportunity, every time. We haven't seen staff like this before. It's a hidden gem off a side street that makes you wonder if this sort of place could exist here. It opens into a lovely place with rooms everywhere. The courtyard is lovely and we have an arrival drink here as we waited for the room to be finalised for us. Little things matter like the heart shaped cake left in our room on St Valentines night along with a rose and the use of a hotel mobile incase we got lost in the souks etc. The room was really nice, 2 negatives being the walls are paper thin so were noisy and the bed was very…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Add to that the great rooms, public spaces, spa, restaurants, breakfasts - well everything really and you've got the perfect place to base yourself to make the most of a fabulous city.

We were lucky to be staying in the royal suite which was amazing but any room would be a joy as the whole Riad is perfect.

A truly wonderful place to stay.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,Wonderful Moroccan flavor outstanding conceriege,"This has a true Moroccan flavor and feel to it as contrasted to some that seem Westernized hotels with a Moroccan veneer. Good assortment of public rooms, nooks, spa and facility for an excellent cooking school. The Moroccan and Western restaurants are excellent. I prefer the garden rooms overlooking the pool, but the patio rooms are also charming. The front desk and concierge services are outstanding not just with directions and dinner reservations, but a great help in negotiating Marakesh taxis and what fares are customary. Highly recommend the book ""Shopping in Marakesh"" which details a series of shopping routes with special interesting stores marked along the way. This was invaluable. When we return to Marakesh we will definitely stay here.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

We stayed at the Le Maison Arabe for the first time and It was truly fantastic! We travel a lot - usually 5/6 times a year and I have to say this has been the best expereince I think I have EVER had. From the moment we were picked up at the airport to the moment we left, we were treated like royalty. I have never expereinced customer service like it, the staff one and all were so ready to help and always friendly and it felt genuine, they wanted us to have the best expereince, whether that was in the hotel, out looking at sights, in Hamman or at the cookery school, not forgetting the two hotel restaurants and Jazz bar.

 February 2015,5,Superb meal,"The La Maison Arabe was recommended to us, by fellow holiday travellers, and were we very pleased with our visit. Like many of the restaurants in Marrakech, the approach to the building is through a narrow street and could be a little off putting. Please do not be put off from taking a meal experience at this restaurant. In our view, it's standards are that of top London restaurants. From entering the building you will be so impressed, it is beautiful inside. While being led up to the bar area, where you are presented with various nibbles, you cannot fail to be impressed with the décor, and the pianist in the bar.

 December 2014,5,Beautifully Moroccan,"After staying in another riad, we noticed that finding oasis-like riads inside a small alley was common. We were brought to La Maison Arabe by Around Morocco Tours http://www.aroundmorocco.com. We were glad we did not stay in chain hotels. We were very happy to stay there as it made us feel like welcomed guests at all times. With an exquisitely decorated maze interior with many stairs, nooks and corners, our stay there was unforgettable. Our rooms were comfortable and nicely set. Their food was great and had many variety of Moroccan and Intercontinental breakfast dishes. We would definitely recommend it to all future travellers to Morocco!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2015,5,An absolute gem,"We have just returned from a weeks holiday at the beautiful Maison Arabe. It's like staying at someone's private residence where you are an important guest. An exquisitely decorated maze of a building, ten minutes walk from the main square and Souks, with plentiful taxis if you get lost, which you probably will. Restaurant food and ambiance couldn't be better, and the lute and guitar players would not be out of place in a concert hall. Don't miss a Hamam at the Spa!!! But for me, like previous reviewers, it's the welcome of the staff and their attention to guests which makes this hotel stand out. We were quite distressed as our luggage didn't arrive and Adil and his team tried continually through the week to retrieve it for us. It could have been a disastrous holiday but…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Extraordinary,"Down a small alley that does not look promising is an oasis in the middle of the city. Four or five riads have been pulled together into an enchanting set of courtyards, restaurants and rooms. A wonderful spa that is almost always able to schedule an appointment on short notice. But the crowning glory of Maison Arabe is the staff. Unfailingly charming and helpful. On short notice they arranged rooms in Rabat, Fes and Casablanca, a driver with excellent English language skills and who could provide restaurant recommendations and local guides. I have travelled extensively and often at luxury properties, but I have never stayed anywhere that was as luxurious and charming.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Fantastic Experience,"La Maison Arabe is fantastic establishment that absolutely made our experience in Marrakesh. The hotel offers wonderful rooms, multiple dining options and a relaxing atmosphere. Above all else the service and staff at the hotel was flawless, from supporting the mundane of getting wash/laundry, to organizing complex day trips, recommending fantastic sights and being willing to draw out any map needed, I can not say enough about the service at La Maison Arabe. I will/have recommended this location to any visitors to Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Perfection in Marrakesh,"One of the very best hotels I have ever stayed in.The hotel is serene and exquisite,with a feeling of Morrocan authenticity and luxury .The courtyards ,bedrooms and social spaces had the feel of a country house comfort.The food was delicious,and largely local cuisine,the breakfast and afternoon tea a welcome bonus.The music and ambience in the restuarant is exceptional.But for me , it was the staff at all levels that made this holiday very special.Nothing was too much trouble and the welcome was genuinely warm.Attentive and interactive but not intrusive in any way;I thought that they were wonderful.It is a haven that I can't wait to return to. The garden and swimming pool about 20 minutes from the hotel was a beautiful place to relax.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Flawless service in a beautiful hotel,"One of the finest hotels I have ever stayed at. The staff is incredible, it is clear that they take a great deal of pride in their work.

 January 2015,4,Winter Sun Weekend Away,"Lovely hotel, a perfect retreat to escape the hustle and bustle of the outside world. We arrived Friday evening, were offered a welcome cocktail and then shown to our room. Very elegant, calm surroundings. We ate outside for breakfast each morning with the sun coming up over the hotel walls in the courtyard and drank cocktails in the Piano Bar in the evenings. Maison Arabe is situated 15 minutes walk from the souks and so easy to get out into the madding crowds. It was also close enough to walk to other sights such as the Jardin Marjorelle. The hotel staff were so friendly, helpful and polite, even completing our boarding cards for when we left on the Monday. They were also excellent in recommending places to eat. A great weekend away in a fab hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Ambience exrsordinaire,Four of us ate here. We all had a cocktail before the meal then three courses with two bottles of local Cabernet. The bill was 3000 dirhams which we felt was good value. The ambience in this restaurant at night is exceptional. Tables are located on a balcony that surrounds the pool and the lighting is very clever as is the decor. Very romantic. The food is excellent and the wine list reasonable. They stock some very good local wines. The staff and the service is superb. Highly recommended,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2014,5,Fantastic experience,"La Maison Arabe is a beautiful small hotel. The decor and facilities are elegant and comfortable and the location is perfect - you can easily walk to all the major sites in Marrakech from here but are far enough out of the hubbub to ensure peace and quiet. The staff could not be more friendly, polite and helpful - down to bubblewrapping tajines for our trip home and walking us to places of interest to us not far from the hotel but too complicated to find on our own! We stayed here for 4 nights with two teenage sons. We all took a cooking class which was held in La Maison's Palmerii location (there is a pool, garden and club style facilities available to hotel guests wanting a little time out from site seeing in Marrakech). The class was hands on, informative and a lot of fun.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Rooms were lovely and warm with the option to have a log fire, seeing as the weather is cold at this time of year. We took the cooking class the lovely Wafa grasped out attention with her introduction to Moroccan food and its history, and Amina and her helper were very helpful with the cooking, recommend everyone to try this. Breakfasts were lovely and they serve the best homemade yogurt I have ever tasted, look out for the little white jars at the breakfast buffet. There is also a local lady making local bread…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Superb. Very recommendable!,"Wow, this is really a great hotel. Hidden in the Medina, it has such an amazing atmosphere thanks to the beautiful building, the interior, all the candles and the lovely rooms. But what really does it, is the friendly and attentive staff. We played golf during our stay in Marrakech and staying in the Medina does not sound like the most convenient solution. But I can assure you that I prefer this a lot instead of the golf resort hotels, usually lacking personality and atmosphere. La Maison Arabe arranged the transports and every time the bags were carried to the car and from the car without any sort of problems at all. The staff has very good recommendations for restaurants and they are always keen to hear how it we had experienced the meals. Also for the restaurants we had…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Lovely hotel and restaurants,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel....it's a little challenging to find, but what isn't in Marrakech? Once we found it, we loved it. The accommodations were very comfortable and the decor was beautiful. We ate in the restaurant and the bar area and enjoyed both. We also had a lunch poolside which was delicious as well. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. I highly recommend La Maison Arabe!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2014,5,A truly special place filled with unbelievable people!,"We recently stayed at La Maison Arabe for 4 nights with our three teenage boys. I can't speak highly enough about our experience! The place itself is gorgeous and we loved our rooms, the public spaces and the luxurious spa. Dinner at the (outdoor) restaurant was also a highlight. But for us, the most outstanding thing of all was the service. Everyone we encountered was friendly and eager to help. Two of my boys had lost their luggage on our initial flight to Morocco and we had been unable to locate it. The staff worked tirelessly to get it back (which they eventually did)! It required countless phone calls and many frustrating conversations but Mourad and the rest of the staff never made us feel like they were anything other than happy to help! In making our travel plans…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Flawless luxury at reasonable price,"We spent five nights here in mid-January, an excellent and quiet time to visit Marrakech. We could not find fault with this hotel, the Maison Arabe fully deserves its reputation as one of the best hotels and restaurants in Marrakech. The rooms are beautifully appointed, ours overlooked the gorgeous, heated pool (15m long). This was originally six riads that have been combined and they are simply stunning. There are fireplaces, candles, roses and fresh oranges in every corner. Rates include an enormous breakfast buffet with all homemade produce (the yoghurt was especially wonderful) and delicious afternoon tea. The staff are, without exception, delightful and attentive; as the hotel is not large we felt totally welcomed and at home. The location is superb, a short walk away from…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2014,5,Totally exceeded our very high expectations,"We stayed here with family on our first stop of Morocco trip. Stayed at one of the Royal suites - this was the perfect blend of a well-run hotel and a Riad style atmosphere. We wanted the Riad environment but didn't feel all that comfortable staying in a very small hotel. Royal suites are beautifully done, very large duplex rooms with a large terrace. Very luxuriously designed as well. The restaurant by the pool for breakfast and lunch was excellent Hotel staff were very good about arranging things for us, including train tickets to Rabat (for which they sent their bell-boy to the station)! Only one comment is that I think the hotel could do a slightly better job about helping with advise on restaurants and other options in the area outside the hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Fantastic relaxing start to the New Year truly fantastic,"We were looking for an alternative mini break to start the New Year and after much searching on Trip Advisor came across reviews for La Maison Arabe. The break was booked for 6th January '15. The taxi meet us at the airport which was organised through Riad/hotel staff, where we had a very short journey to our destination. When we arrived we were taken through a short alley way, where we entered La Maison Arabe and wow the start off our Moroccan experience began. The reception staff were extremely polite and couldn't do enough for us including the front office manager Adil Chaif. We were given suite 240 which was amazing and exuded a sophisticated elegance, which over looked the pool. Our stay was only for four nights and we truly loved our time. Everything about this place…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,Fabulous New Year at the Maison,"We spent the period between Christmas and New Year at the Hotel. Firstly, the weather was wonderful and I can highly recommend Marrakech at New Year. Secondly, Maison Arabe is amazing. We stayed ten years ago as a family in the Maison Arabe as part of a longer trip and found it to be much the best option in Marrakech. We much preferred it to a Riad. In truth it is a cross between a Riad and a luxury hotel. The location is amazing just outside the medina. The building has been decorated in an amazingly comfortable and homely fashion. The building is a fascinating maze of interesting rooms both the public rooms and the bedrooms. The decor is fun and it feels very exotic in a nice way. The bedrooms are wonderfully comfortable. The floors are heated in the winter and the rooms very…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2015,5,One of the best hotel in the world,"La Maison is a unique property that I'd recommend anyone to go to Morocco and try just for the hotel. It's a riad style hotel which means it's a large mansion with an atrium in the middle with a pool and restaurant. The place is fairly large but always manages to feel cozy. What makes the place stand out so much is the over the top friendliness and service level. Everyone greets you (often by name) and offers to help you in some manner whether it's taking your bags, holding a sneeze guard for the buffet, or bringing whatever you want to wherever you are. People always smiled and greeted you. I've never had better, more personalized service in my life and I've stayed at the Four Seasons, Fairmont, Mandarin Oriental, and Park Hyatt. It probably just comes with the fact it's a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 November 2014,5,Wonderful riad experience!,"We recently stayed at La Maison Arabe for 4 nights as the first stop on our 2 week Morocco tour. It turned out to be a great choice.

 December 2014,5,"Beautiful, luxurious hotel in Marrakech","We spent two nights in a beautiful room overlooking the pool at La Maison Arabe.

The courtyard and every part of the hotel was full of Moroccan charm. So glad we decided to stay here!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2014,5,Wonderful hotel with exceptional staff,"I am a cynical grumpy old bugger, but my gorgeous wonderful wife took me here to Celebrate my 50th birthday at the hotel, the staff presented me with the most delicious chocolate cake with lit candles and then proceeded to sing happy birthday in English, French & Arabic. The staff cannot do enough for you and always have a genuine smile. The Hotel itself is a hidden gem tucked away down a lane in true Moroccan style. Once inside you enter a wonderful world of understated elegance and sublime beauty; this really is one of the best places I have ever stayed in. Nothing is too much trouble. The building is an intoxicating mix of gorgeous indigenous architecture and the modern world gently adapted to make your stay even more wonderful. The place isn't built along traditional…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2014,5,Truly spectacular hotel,"I love, love, LOVE this hotel. Last time I was in Marrakech my husband and I ended up coming here twice for dinner because the restaurants (there are two!) are so lovely, and this trip we had to stay. The architecture is spectacular — a traditional riad setup with beautifully ornate decorations and a variety of tranquil common spaces. The rooms themselves are spacious, bright, and elegantly decorated. It was just a little too chilly in mid-December to go swimming, but the outdoor pool/dining space/sun decks are lovely. The service is impeccable — everyone is wonderfully friendly, accommodating, and helpful in the extreme. I accidentally made a Hotels.com reservation for the wrong month and only noticed days before we were due to arrive (during a pretty busy period, no less)…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2014,5,My favorite part of Morocco,"My friend and I recently traveled on our own to Marrakech and we stayed at the lovely Maison Arabe for 4 nights. The staff could not have been more helpful or welcoming. Our room, complete with a private balcony, was beautiful and spacious. I would highly recommend getting one of the Hammam packages. I have never felt so clean and relaxed in my life. The cooking class was also a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend it, even for the least enthusiastic cooks. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was delicious and far exceeded any version of a free western breakfast. I especially enjoyed the special Moroccan crepe prepared fresh for me. My friend and I quickly became regulars at the jazz bar, where I can say from ample experience, they make a great white…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,"Authentic Riad, a buzz on the senses Must see, must try. If you dont stay you will be made welcome as a visitor.","We stayed for several days as guests at the Maison Arabe during November. On arrival down a small well kept alleyway we wondered how this place we had selected could possibly house all the accommodation and services it had to offer. Set just within the Medina it is a short 10 minute walk into the centre of town. Within a short stroll of the Riad you find Marrakesh is buzzing with local creative people, providing all the needs of local residents, a real feel for being in an exciting and safe place. Every person we encountered in the street during our stay were friendly helpful and keen to chat to practice their English!

 December 2014,5,A drink in the late afternoon,We had very good weather during out stay in Marrakesh up to the last day when it was cool and rainy. The rain started the previous evening and continued on and off through the next day. We could hear if lashing down on the plastic cover to the courtyard of the raid that we were renting. By the middle of the afternoon we had enough of reading on-line newspapers and had to get out. I had noticed the reviews of this hotel so we decided to walk by and have a look. Walking into the small lobby we at once felt the warmth of the wood fire burning in the open fireplace. We at once decided to stay for a drink. The basement bar is more a large lounge with a small bar. In the background was pleasant jazz music. We were the only patrons. The drinks were about the same as in the…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,Love this gem of a place,"We have only ever eaten at La Maison Arabe preferring to stay just outside the madness of the Medina. But this is such a gorgeous venue, and you feel you have been whisked right back to the film set of 'Casablanca' sitting in the restaurant sipping the house cocktail, listening to the pianist. Very romantic. We have eaten here on two separate occasions both last year and this year: inside the stunning restaurant and outside around by the pool. Despite it being cooler during our stay last time we ate outside and there were outside heaters which kept us toasty! I would definitely recommend outside dining - it is just so pretty. Gorgeous food, well presented, nice and relaxed, lovely staff and the best Morrocan wine - it's a really interesting place to visit full of beautiful…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,Gracious and Helpful,"We stayed for four nights and found the riad to be ultra comfortable, perhaps edging on luxury when it comes to riads. The front office were consistently friendly and helpful. While breakfast was tasty and spread excellent the service was not the most consistent, however when I made it known they were quick to react to it. The bar is nice and quiet and there is wonderful music played live in the evenings. There are 2 restaurants but we had to cancel reservations do to a conflict. Additionally they run a cooking class on a working garden on the edge of town. That was another excellent experience where the master chef did an excellent job teaching us how to make Chicken Tajine, eggplant and banana pepper sides as well as coconut cookies. We will stay here anytime....loved it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Everything about my stay was wonderful. The cheerful, friendly, yet professional staff make you feel as if La Maison were your home, and are always available to help immediately with any request or service, large or small. The breakfast (included) is a delicious feast of both Moroccan and international proportions. The room was very quiet and spacious, with balcony overlooking the pool and garden courtyard, with a working fireplace that housekeeping would build for you any time of day or night. The restaurant Les Trois Saveurs is one of the best in the city. And the hammam spa is a delightful oasis from the hectic city. Five-plus stars!!!! Thank you!!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The rooms/suites are extremely comfort and look on to a exquisite court yard with a swimming pool in the middle, which is kept equally as emaculate as the hotel itself.The cooking course was excellent and a translator provided.

This Riad is in the old town within the Medina City Wall and close to the Saadian Tombs, El Badi Palace and Palais El Bahia. There is really nothing to say or to add about the Riad that has not been said or written before (positive or negative), for us and as far as this Riad is concerned the positives far outweighs the negatives – and rightly so. In all honesty we cannot compare this Riad to any other Riad as we've had no other Riad experience to make any comparisons against.

The Riad is truly beautiful and afternoon tea is a real occasion. We attended the cookery school and had a wonderful lesson on Moroccan Cookery. The Spa was also wonderful.

My room overlooked a central courtyard with a fountain in the middle. La Madison arabe had a nice pool area, and has two excellent restaurants. The Moroccan restaurant was the best restaurant we experienced after being in morocco for the week.

Highly recommended.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,A wonderful retreat in Marrakech,"This is the one of the best hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. It was a special trip for us celebrating our ruby wedding and the bottle of red wine and rose petals decorating the room were a wonderful start to our holiday. The room itself was spacious, beautifully decorated and the bed huge and very comfortable.. The communal areas are great places to relax and reminiscent of interior design magazines. The location is excellent, close to the souks and a 15 minute walk to the main square however, once inside the Riad, you feel a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The staff are efficient and very courteous. I thought the 10% service charge added to the bill for distribution to staff an excellent idea. Often one ends up tipping those…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,Wonderful friendly atmosphere,"Quite simply the best riad in which we stayed during a tour of Moroccan cities, so friendly, genuine, courteous and welcoming. We spent a total of three days here, in two visits, and had three different rooms, all of which were beautiful. On our return visit it was like a homecoming, so warm was the welcome. The restaurants and service were outstanding. We hope to come again and absorb more of the atmosphere. My wife has mobility problems and the staff could not have done more to help her and make us feel at home.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,Great Riad in Marakesh,"We were greeted with warmth and helpfulness. The staff could not have been more generous or attentive. There are two restaurants, a Moroccan restaurant and an international restaurant. There is a comfortable Jazz bar. The pool is in the courtyard. It has one of the most luxurious hammams in Marrakesh.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,Wonderful experience,"I stayed at this hotel with 3 friends. We are mature ladies in our 50s. Thoroughly recommend this hotel as a lovely Central location from which to visit the central square and souks. The hotel is tucked down an alley so is also very quiet and away from the hussle and bussle of the Medina. Above all else though, the staff were among the most friendly, helpful and courteous I have come across in my travels. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and safe and nothing was too much trouble. You would have an amazing time if you chose this hotel. I couldn't comment on the spa as we didn't use this.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,Just fabulous,"We spent four days in this hotel. The location is great - not too far from most places of interest. Because it's tucked away in an alley, it's very quiet at night which is nice after a full-hassle night in the Medina. The staff are very friendly - it's obvious they love what they do. Everything in the place worked efficiently, except the safe (but that's not a big problem). I booked in to do the cookery class. So pleased I did. The spa was perfect. If I do visit Marrakech again,this will definitely by our choice.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,a suggestive atmosphere.......,"Certainly a particular Riad. An excellent experience in the strategic heart of Marrakech, closed to the Medina.

 November 2014,5,Best of everything at Maison Arabe!,"I can't recommend this hotel more highly! Upon our week long excursion through Morocco we first landed in Marrakech. Our experience at Maison Arabe was perfect! It was equal parts authentically Moroccan while also satisfying the need for western comforts. The staff was so attentive and kind as soon as we arrived. We felt like we were their only guests for all 3 nights we stayed. The front desk staff sat with us for about an hour discussing our trip over the next week and helped us to get the best driver and guide that ended up taking us all over the country. The food was out of this world, the accommodations were authentic, safe, and extremely comfortable. We were greeted with a Moroquito (a hotel original- part lime, part, pineapple juice, part ginger) which we craved for the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,Wonderful Riad with outstanding customer service,"We have just returned from a long weekend at La Maison Arabe. It is without doubt one of the most enjoyable experiences we have had. Its not just the fact that its in a great location within walking distance of the souks, that the building is beautiful, wonderfully decorated and furnished or that the food is great and that Roshid from the Jazz bar makes the consistently perfect margaritas and mojitos. Its that the customer service is absolutely second to none. The staff bend over backwards to do everything they can to make your stay is as enjoyable and trouble free as possible. Of course there were some things that weren't perfect. It is expensive for Marrakech, but then you know that when you book. The riad itself is bigger than I had imagined (not their fault!), I would…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,Sanctuary in the Medina,"We stayed here last week for 4 nights. We had a junior suite with a terrace area... just beautiful. Clean,comfortable room. The housekeepers were so efficient and whenever we returned to the room it was spruced up and everything replenished. The hotel was a much needed sanctuary in the busy,dustiness of Marrakech. Authentic decor with added luxury. Both restaurants on site were delicious and service was impeccable. A little pricey... but if its a treat time its ok! The wine bar was a nice space and there was live music there most nights, in fact we loved the music at the restaurants too...really added to the atmosphere. Sometimes a guitarist other nights a tradtional drummer. The spa was a beautiful area. We had Hammans,massages and pedicures while we were there! The Hamman is…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,4,Lovely riad but very pricey for Marrakech,"After reading the incredible reviews for this hotel on Tripadvisor, we (two couples) decided to spend 4 days here recently. The riad is charming with it's Berber style décor. The staff is excellent. Breakfasts served by the pool were indeed very good. However given that we paid about $350.00 per night per room, we felt that our rooms were small and the bathrooms needed to be upgraded. We had lunch by the pool upon arrival but our chicken dish was dry. We decided to have our other meals elsewhere. We were disappointed given the incredible reviews that we read on this site.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2014,5,An Oasis in Marrakesh,"What an amazing place. The minute your walk into this beautiful Riad, you are greeted with stunning antique Moroccan décor, surreal tranquillity and impeccable service. The outside pool area is delightful. The staff couldn't do enough for you - they even loaned us a mobile phone so we could call for help if we got lost in the city (which we did!). The food was excellent in all the restaurants and complementary afternoon tea is served each day, which added a lovely touch. We attended the cooking school and opted to do it at the hotel's Country Club, 15 mins by car from the hotel. The course was very educational, fun well organised, held in a well equipped teaching kitchen. Afterwards we were able to eat our own prepared dishes in the well manicured kitchen garden surrounding…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,Such a pleasure to stay here!!,"I have stayed in several places around Marrakech and Morocco but was truly charmed and impressed with the level of service and the quality of the accommodations at La Maison Arabe. I had a darling room with pool view. Impeccable service and attention to detail, really. The restaurant is delicious! and the live music was the icing on the cake at dinner. The spa looked gorgeous but was booked up unfortunately during my stay. I recommend staying here very highly. You are close enough to the main square and with great shopping closeby. Plus you can actually be driven almost to the front door of this Riad which is a rarity inside the Medina! Their airport transfer was actually the most affordable I found! Loved it!! and will stay again ; )",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,"Boutique hotel a delight, cooking class fun","This is more of a boutique hotel than a true riad, and it is really special. My group came here for cooking class. They have a fabulous setup that can accommodate 12 students. We then ate our meal in the beautiful outdoor courtyard dining area. I am not sure how well situated this hotel is to the square and the sights and sounds of the medina, but I can tell you without hesitation that I would stay here on a second visit to Marrakech. Absolutely lovely cooking staff. Beautiful, elegant property that is a cut above.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,As good as it gets!,"We learned of La Maison Arabe through TripAdvisor so it seems only fair to write about our experiences for others. In summary: This hotel is about as good as it gets. Location is perfect - minutes by taxi from the airport, and 15 minutes walk from the Jemaa el-Fnaa square and souks. Once inside the walls you find a warren of courtyards and quiet spaces. It is very quiet - you hear neither other guests or the bustle of the surrounding streets. The decor is amazing - not just beautiful but finished with incredible attention to detail. There are no visible pipes, wires, cracks, water marks or anything else. There are pots, lamps and all sorts of other details to stop and stare at everywhere. We visited with two youngish children (6 and 9) and a 6 month old baby. We were not…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,Earns its reputation as a legendary hotel,"La Maison Arabe is an elegant retreat in the bustle of the medina of Marrakech. It earns its reputation as the staff bent over backwards to accommodate every request (including wrapping an odd-shaped instrument as airline carry-on, and baking special breads for our gluten free traveler). Honestly, no request was too great, the hospitality was enthusiastic and friendly, and the private restful location was a welcome respite after a long day of hard bargaining in the souks. My husband went to the Hammam and came back rejuvenated and relaxed. Their restaurants are great, but during our stay they also willingly directed us to others within a short walk.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,"Beautiful oasis, superb service, great location","We've just spent 16 days in Morocco, visiting 6 cities and towns - some as a couple and others as part of a group. We spent 4 nights at La Maison Arabe toward the end of our trip and were able to make comparisons. This was the best ""Riad"" we visited. The service was very responsive and helpful (in a country that can claim to be high on hospitality and friendly service), the room was beautiful and spacious (overlooking the courtyard and pool) and the food gave us a sense that there are many quality levels of the same Moroccan recipes, and it was among the best we'd experienced. The place is secluded but very accessible to the ""main square"", as well as to other entry points to the souq and other major attractions. Staff are all fluent in English, very responsive and friendly.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,An oasis in the madness of Marrackech,"We were delighted with this hotel. The spa, rooms and restaurant are all excellent. The bar and head bar man were fantastic. The hotel makes you feel totally enveloped in discrete luxury and comfort. We also went to the second pool at the hotel's 'club' on outskirts of town. Great place to go for some lunch and to walk in the gardens. Only 10 minutes away by shuttle. Do try the cookery course, especially if you are in a group. We did it as a family and everyone from the 11 year old to the incompetent Dad managed it. Great way to spend a morning.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,A Wonderful Stay at La Maison Arabe,"I just returned from La Maison Arabe in Marrakech and has a phenomenal stay. I traveled with 10 other people and we each felt that this was a stay worth repeating. From the rooms, to the hospitality, to the spa, to the food...each aspect was wonderful and well done. As a travel agent, I put this trip together and my clients relied upon me to ensure that their visit was memorable...in a positive way. I looked at other places to stay...including the 4 Seasons and opted for La Maison Arabe because of its location within the medina. I thought that a more authentic place (i.e. a riad) would be more exciting than a standard ""all rooms look the same"" hotel. For sure, even though the 4 Seasons was probably more luxurious, it wasn't more authentic and for our group, La Maison…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,The Best!!!!,"Friends recommended this Riad to us and now we are delighted to recommend it to you. We had a memorable stay for 5 nights. Our junior suites were lovely and spacious. The staff is incredible. They anticipate your every need, are friendly, helpful and always have a smile. Rashid, in the bar, is amazing and fun. Take one of Maison Arabe's cooking classes. It was great fun. Marrakesh is a wonderful city. A day trip to the High Atlas Mountains was great. If you go to Marrakesh, a stay at the Maison Arabe is a must! ,",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,Justifiably one of the top 100 small hotels in the world,"Just returned from long weekend with family. There is nothing you can fault about this hotel. It is quiet, calm, discrete, private, restful and above all luxurious. The decor is classically Arabic with a rich mix of antiques and furniture assembled with an expert eye. The restaurant is superb and its setting next to the reflecting pool makes for a classic dinner of Moroccan or international cuisine. Being small the staff soon get to know all the guests and are friendliness personified. Mint tea in the afternoon by the pool was a highlight after a morning haggling in the souks. The Morojito cocktail invented by Rashid the bar manager became my son's favourite. You must visit the country club which is only 15 minutes away as that is a haven of peace and quiet after a busy…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,Wonderful!,"La Maison Arabe is a beautiful and peaceful Riad in the heart of the medina in bustling Marrakech with first class service, accommodation and restaurants.

 October 2014,5,What a gem!,"This beautifully appointed small hotel is located in the medina of Marrakech. What gorgeous rooms, lovely restaurant (around the pool) and bar, and a special cooking school....not to be missed. The flower-filled patios are lovely. And the Hamman and Wellness Center downstairs is truly a Moroccan experience. The staff and service are also trop notch. This is the perfect alternative to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,An oasis of calm and all round excellence,"Just come back from a long weekend and really can't fault this hotel. I believe the hotel used to be two properties which have now been joined and it retains its character, with carved wood panelling all around and a lovely courtyard with a fountain and seating for some pre dinner drinks. It also has a swimming pool, bar and 2 restaurants. It is well placed for the key sites of the old town, close to the Souk, the main square etc. Service was faultless, smiling and unforced. It's a phrase that gets overused in reviews but the staff really couldn't do enough for us, right down to filling in our airport exit forms for us, without us asking, before we left, they were without exception excellent. There are 2 restaurants, we only ate in one of them, the one by the pool, the food…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,A beautiful RIAD but the service needs improving,"The RIAD is beautiful and is nice to not have to walk through a souk to get to it. We were in a Royal Suite number 227 Nahar which was perfect for our family. It had a king bed and bathroom upstairs on the mezzanine and on the ground floor a seating area and twin beds and another bathroom for our 2 children. We also had a roof terrace. The RIAD had a good size pool but we utilised their country club which was a 15 min shuttle ride away most afternoons which has loungers and a larger pool which gives the benefit of being in the centre whilst also having a larger pool area. The food was excellent but it was the service that doesn't make it quite the 5 stars. Every morning at breakfast something was missing off the table, slow to clear dishes etc and during dinner one evening they…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,Great Hotel - Great Location,"My husband and I recently returned from Morocco and this was by far the best hotel we stayed at during our trip! La Maison Arabe is an oasis in Morocco. The rooms are beautiful and overlook the pool. The staff was so helpful, especially Hicham at the front desk, and Rachid as the head bar tender. They both took such good care of us from directions about town to selecting a nice wine for dinner. The restaurant by the pool was great and served both traditional Moroccan food as well as international food. All in all - just amazing and I'd highly recommend it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,First Class Hotel,My wife and I cannot speak too highly of this excellent hotel and it's beautiful country club with restaurant and large pool just outside the town and to which there is an efficient and comfortable free shuttle bus. The rooms are super and the staff incredibly helpful and courteous. We spent a wonderful week there and have no hesitation in recommending it. It's also very conveniently situated with access to the markets and all parts of the town. Nigel and Tessa Morgan,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,"Experience is beyond compare, just amazing","We spent nearly two weeks in Morocco, but there was no doubt about which review I was going to write first. La Maison Arabe is absolutely incredible. As with many things in Morocco, you have to go down a small side street to get to the Riad, but once in the door, it opens to a giant oasis of calm in a gorgeous setting. We stayed for three nights, but landed up in two rooms. One room was even more amazing than the other. The breakfast was lovely and the various restaurants and rooms around the hotel made for a wonderful experience. However, I can honestly say that it is the staff that turns a phenomenal riad into one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. I also need to specifically recognize Adil, the front office manager. I have not met a more passionate manager who…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,Loved every minute of my stay,"What a brilliant place, the service and helpfulness of the staff were the best I have ever experienced , the rooms were large cool and comfortable and the beds were just right. The food in the restaurant was first class and I would recommend the lamb cooked in a clay pot to anyone.We went on the cookery course and that was well worth the fee and I have even managed to replicate the dishes we made. Special mention must go to Rashid the barman who was always prepared to do anything for you, and his cocktails were excellent too.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,Most memorable stay Ever,"We had an amazing 4 night stay at this Riad. The customer service was beyond exceptional. The staff here went above and beyond any expectations we had. They thought of things we didnt even think of. For example, they filled out our customs card for the airport when we were checking out so we were prepared when arriving at the airport. The rooms were beautifully decorated with colors and designs that made you feel as though you were in Morocco. The rooms were cleaned for us multiple times a day, as many times we we left the room, our clothes were even folded for us. Breakfast was always a pleasure by the pool, we were greeted and served as though we were the only ones there. Fresh squeezed juices, fruits, meats, cheeses, etc. all for breakfast. The pool at the hotel was…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

It has been extended since our last stay and now has a beautiful pool with a restaurant around it and terraces with sun loungers, a wonderful place to return to after browsing the nearby souks. The best of both worlds as it also has a pool set in beautiful gardens a 10 min drive away (free transport supplied by the hotel) where you can have a delicious lunch and spend a tranquil time away from the bustle of the Medina. We had a spacious room with balcony overlooking the pool and luxurious bathroom. The hammans and massages are second to none experienced before.

 September 2014,5,Second visit even better than First,"We visited this wonderful Riad in May this year & we loved it so much that we came back again in September & again it exceeded all our expectations. The service from all the staff was excellent, from Adil on the front desk to Rachid in the piano bar, & the staff in the restaurants, nothing was too much trouble. We are always a little sceptical about some of the reports on Trip Advisor but this Riad deserves all the glowing reports it gets. The staff are wonderful, essentially making the holiday very special. This time we booked the cooking class at the country club, which we wouldn't have missed, it was a great experience - make sure you have a go if you have time!. We also took a day trip to the Atlas mountains, arranged by Aldi. It was great to see the countryside, outside of…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,La Maison Arabe,"This hotel is brilliantly situated and the staff's customer service knows no bounds, in particular Adil. We actually arrived a day early, our own mistake, but the staff hid any sign of panic and gave us the best suite in the place for the evening (and for the booking price). Breakfast is huge, full of choice and until 11am, very civilised! We booked late so the deal was that we moved each night. We had a system whereby we packed our cases and they moved them and all our wardrobe items. It was seamless and very enjoyable! The first suite comprised of three floors, sitting room, mezzanine bedroom and rooftop terrace complete with jacuzzi and area for a party of 30+! Each room has a sitting room, often with a balcony and sizeable bathroom. Decor has huge attention to detail and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,Outstanding hotel and location,"Spent two wonderful nights in this oasis of good food, outstandingly warm and accommodating hospitality and perfect locational convenience for safely exploring Marrakech. The quality of the hotel architecture, decor, rooms and facilities was extremely high, well though through and perfectly executed. The hotel had a genuinely warm and authentically Moroccan feel. They really looked after us and made us feel very special. Some of the stairs are steep and narrow and so if you have mobility issues you'd be best to request lower or ground floor rooms. Very highly recommended.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2014,5,A unique experience,"This Riad has exceeded all our expectations so far! We have visited many other places in Marocco, but you can not beat the kitchen and service there.

 September 2014,5,Splendor in the heart of Marrakech,"This is the spot to choose if you want to feel part of the city, and not sequestered at a resort. The hotel is actually made up of several old riads (houses), beautifully merged and elegantly decorated. Dinner next to the interior courtyard pool, lit by candles, was one of the most magical nights of our whole stay in Morocco. The hotel also has a separate location just outside of town to escape the city hubbub, with a large pool, extensive gardens, and the larger of the two cooking school facilities. A perfect retreat when Marrakech starts to overwhelm, and it means the hotel can give travelers the best of both worlds, town and country.

A very comfortable bed, well equipped room and excellent bathroom. Top marks to the Hammam and the Country Club - good restaurants but again I come back to the wonderful staff who really made the stay. They couldn't help you enough. I've stayed at some of the best hotels in the world and I have to say that the service here ranks amongst the very best.

We arrived on the morning of the class and where shown to a beautiful room for tea and cakes before being taken to class. 12 of us of differing nationalities attended. All of us loved it. The lesson was fun, informative, entertaining and most importantly of all, the food we created was gorgeous. Most of us bought the cookery book after and had it signed by the staff.

 October 2014,5,Best of two worlds - Twice!,"Coming to Marrakesh gives you the choice of staying in a historic Riad or a splashy hotel. La Maison Arabe is one of the few places that combines the best of both. A beautiful historic building tucked into the medina with two great restaurants, piano bar and excellent staff. Your get the artistic and architectural touches of a Riad and the choices/conveniences of a larger property. But that is not the only benefit La Maison Arabe offers! Ask about the ""country club."" Hourly vans take you 15 minutes away to the Palmeria and a tranquil world of gardens, a large pool and lovely meals under trees watching turtles resting around a pond.

The location, right in the middle of the Medina, 10 minutes walk from the main square is perfect. First impressions count & they certainly did. Initially it felt like we were being shown around a private house, though we were lucky enough to be honoured guests. A warmth lacking in so many upmarket establishments, yet in abundance from the moment we stepped though the doors. Our room (241) overlooked the pool, the mosque in the background.

I am sure the team who welcome you into their lives have discovered the art of mental telepathy. You want for nothing, they have gorgeous smiles, great senses of humour and hospitality that is second to none. Our favourite moments for me, was the cooking class, what a great experience, Thank you DADA you are an amazing teacher, and Tracey's face continues to light up as she shares her experience she enjoyed in the spa treatment room, 2.5 hours of heavenly bliss she will never forget.

Don't be put off by the approach to the hotel entrance it is down a narrow lane, very common in Marrakech, but once you step over the threshold it is amazing. Reception staff were charming, and helpful. We were treated to a room upgrade. A suite on the top floor. The downside, it was on the top floor with no lift but very comfortable. We needed the exercise as the food offered is delicious with varied menus, and wine list in all restaurants. The breakfast buffet is sumptuous, fresh fruit, pastries, cold meats, cheeses, juices, eggs any way you like them and delicious coffee.

We were upgraded to a suite which was located up some very steep stairs - quite fun for two ladies not in the first flush of youth but by the end of our visit we were getting used to them. Lovely staff who could not do more to make you feel at home and some very nice touches with complimentary tea in the afternoon between 3pm and 6pm. The hotel has a lovely country club (with a good pool and sunbeds) which you get to using the complimentary shuttle bus. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at anywhere in the world. If I ever return to Marrakesh I will make sure I stay here.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Mindblowing Morocco,La Maison Arabe was a fantastic experience. The trip to Morocco was a 50th birthday present from my sister and was truly amazing. The riad in all its splendor was awesome - we had the royal suite which was absolutely sensational spread over two floors with a rooftop garden and spa. The staff were more than attentive and in particular would like to mention Raheem who works in the cocktail bar he was unbelievable and made our holiday so special.

 September 2014,5,Birthday Amazement,"Marrakech was the final destination of a 2 week+ fabulous trip to 5 cities in Spain to conclude in Marrakech and La Maison Arabe was the most fascinating and amazing hotel where we stayed as I celebrated my birthday with my partner and friends. Truly the best was saved for last and do not be deceived by what you may see when you arrive. In fact as we arrived by taxi, I remembered from tours in Spain that it is Muslim custom to maintain a modest outside and concentrate on what is inside - so keep that in mind when you arrive. What a beautiful place with 5 star service and style that was simply unmatched. The staff was attentive and friendly, the bar was accommodating and the food was simply superb as the restaurant staff sang Happy Birthday in English and Arabic. From the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,Charming Maison Arabe,"A truly well-run hotel, excellent in every respect. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Beautifully decorated in Moroccan style. Very much enjoyed the pool and immaculate gardens at the country club which was a place of calm tranquillity away from the frenetic Medina.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,Best run hotel ever,"I endorse the many rave reviews of this riad-hotel. It is conveniently situated; it is decorated in impeccable taste; the food and service in the beautiful pool-side restaurant are excellent; the country club is an oasis of peace and quiet, perfect for rest and relaxation. Our suite was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. What makes this hotel extra special is the calibre of the staff it employs. They are professional, efficient, friendly, courteous and fall over themselves to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Above all, they all seem happy in their work, are proud of the hotel, and this shows in their attitude. Clearly the hotel's management is doing an excellent job here and are to be congratulated. Marrakech itself is a fascinating and historic city and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,Fantastic hotel,We stayed in 4 hotels in Marrakech for our honeymoon. This hotel is on a par with the four seasons for luxury. The staff were great and the service was fantastic. We hope to return very soon. The country club was an added bonus which allowed us to fully relax during the day before visiting the Medina at night. The hotel even allowed us to use a room to shower and change before our evening flight.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,Couldn't love this place more,"Of all six cities that we visited during our 2 1/2 week trip to Spain and Marrakesh this hotel is by far the most incredible and special. In fact I'm pretty sure it's the most incredible place I've ever stayed in all of my travels. Do not be concerned when you are originally brought to the hotel by a car or taxi as the entrance is setback from the street and it's all about the inside of the property. The service at this hotel is absolutely top-notch; everyone is fully aware of your needs, specifications and reservations which I found incredibly impressive. Everyone is beautiful inside and out and eager to ensure that your stay is incredible. The restaurant is sublime. The location relative to other sites is also outstanding. And we had the most magical experience in the home…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2014,5,Excellent quality but above all excellent service,"This is the 1001st review, and I wish we could have stayed for One Thousand And One Arabian Nights. As it was we stayed for ten wonderful days. What you have here is a boutique hotel of the highest standard, a restaurant to match (which has its own superb reputation), an onsite Hamman, Cooking school, Jazz Bar, proximity to all that Marrakech has to offer, and service of the very highest quality. From the breakfast staff, room service, receptionists to Rachid in the Wine bar, you couldn't fault anything. And on top of that there's the bonus of the Kasbah Country Club, with the other facilities. When we had a late flight home, a room of the highest standard was provided for us to relax and have a shower.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,fantastic stay,"Myself and my Husband stayed in the Riad for a few days towards the end of our Honeymoon. We had a fantastic stay, we found all staff especially reception and bar staff to be extremely helpful and friendly. Lovely room that wasn't too noisy considering we were in the heart of the Marrakech but my favourites had to be the traditional Morrocan Spa and their Country club which had a pool and we could sit and relax.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Wonderful hotel,"Total luxury - we had a wonderful stay here. The food was brilliant, really great, and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Our room was great, but after a couple of nights the air conditioning was leaking, so they moved us to another room, this one with a balcony and TWO SINKS (I was particularly taken with the TWO SINKS!) - rather a win, really! The hotel pool is rather oddly located, basically in the middle of the restaurant, but they also have the most fabulous country club to which they run a shuttle service throughout the day. We spent the whole day there on our second day in Marrakech, and I can honestly say I have never felt so pampered and special. Welcome drinks on arrival, hats and towels provided and those enormous daybed things under their own canopies, a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Not only exceptional lodging - an experience,"La Maison Arabe is an exceptional expérience of Marrakesh and Morocco. We stayed three nights and were reticent to leave the delightful, strike that - truly sublime environment. When we arrived by taxi from the airport we found an unassuming entrance but as soon as we entered La Maison we knew we were some place special. We were immediately greeted by reception and effortlessly checked in and into an upgraded suite by a smiling and gracious host. He escorted us to a beautifully appointed suite with a private balcony overlooking the pool and interior courtyard then invited us for a tour of the property and a unique and refreshing beverage. As the other reviews have stated this is a first class, though relaxed and unassuming, hotel. The staff was truly exceptional, from the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Absolutely the best!,"After staying at a terrible hotel just a five-minute walk away, we booked this riad for three nights and ended up staying nine or 10! This place has the most accommodating staff I've ever experienced at a hotel. They offered to upgrade us and even move all our things, gave me a tangine and cookbook before we checked out and never missed a chance to ask if everything was to our liking. They pepper you with mint tea and cookies, their own trademark drink, watermelon...without charge! While there's a beautiful pool at the hotel location, be sure to take advantage of the free shuttle to their stunning garden/pool on the edge of the city - it's spectacular. The hotel restaurant is acclaimed and great, as were breakfasts that included everything from crepes to a chicken in a bechamel…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 August 2014,5,First class from top to bottom - loved every minute,"Where do I start to talk about how much I love this place? It has to be the people. Everyone I encountered at La Maison Arabe was fantastic. Upon my arrival the airline lost the carry-on I didn't want to check in the first place (but that's a different review!). I arrived at La Maison Arabe with only the clothes on my back and felt completely taken care of. In fact, for my four-night stay I felt as if I was in a home away from home. I also must talk about the quality of the facility. Everything from the pool to the hammam to the room to the restaurant was of the highest quality, and every detail had been thought of. The food and wine in the restaurant were excellent (I enjoyed both Moroccan and French fare, and both were fantastic.) The services in the hammam were…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Fantastic Property and Service,"We spent four days at this Riad/Hotel during our first trip to Morocco in August. I was concerned about how child friendly it would be. The hotel is quiet but it was lovely for our family. My son loved the pool at the riad and adored the pool at the country club. The food was terrific at breakfast -- the Moroccan crepes were amazing and the lady who make them was wonderful. The decor is super. My teenage daughter and I went to the hammam, which was also excellent. Overall, I have only rave for Maison Arabe and plan to stay there again if I am lucky enough to get to Marrakech again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,"Amazing Hotel - If considering, just book it!","If you are going to Marrakech and plan to stay anywhere outside of say The Four Seasons or Hotel Ryad Naoura Barriere (both of which run $1000+/night) then stay at the La Maison Arabe. It is a beautiful hotel, affordable and easily 4+ star treatment. I chose this specific hotel after seeing great reviews on Trip Advisor and also seeing that it won an award for Travelers Choice for 2014. It met all those criteria and more. The hotel is beautiful, tranquil, quiet. The rooms are nicely fitted and clean. The staff was extremely helpful and nice. Same goes for the wait staff and food - all amazing. In fact, we arrived to the hotel at midnight and the staff still made us dinner. Great - great - great unexpected service. You will find the hotel is well situated and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Exquisite Hotel With A Fabulous Spa,"Wow! This hotel is a true stunner. It's Moroccan elegance at its best. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the mint tea service is divine, and the grounds are beautiful. I enjoyed the meals here, but more than anything I enjoyed the spa. I spent a full day in the spa and had the works. The hamam experience is something that I will never forget. I was scrubbed clean and left feeling like a new woman. After visiting the souks of Morocco, this spa day was definitely needed. I think I'll dream about that spa for the rest of my life. Until next time!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Amazing Honeymoon,"This was truly the best hotel that both my wife and I have ever stayed in. We were treated like family from moment we checked in, and were furnished with a free upgrade to an absolutely stunning Junior Suite looking over the pool. The hotel was beautiful, and the food served at breakfast and in the restaurant at dinner was exceptional. We treated ourselves to a visit to the Hammam for a Royal Session and a massage, and we also both took part in the Cookery Course which was a real highlight of the trip - just the two of us in the cookery school, with four members of staff on hand to teach us everything we needed to know about Tagines, Moroccan Salads and Coconut Cookies! The hotel is placed about 10 minutes away from the main square which meant it was quiet and very relaxing and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Fantastic!,"It was our first visit to Marrakech, so we really didn't know what to expect. When we arrived at La Maison Arabe, we were thrilled! It is exotic, yet totally refined and elegant. The staff are amazing- sweet, eager to please and help. The location is great. We had 2 of our teenagers with us and both our rooms were beautiful! The food was delicious- we were sorry we didn't have time for a cooking class. The Hammam was incredible! We really only have positive things to say about the hotel- they truly made our experience in Marrakech and we look forward to returning! We highly recommend it!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Gorgeous stay in Marrakech,"My boyfriend and I decided to stay at La Maison Arabe in Marrakech as one of our nicer accommodations on a long trip. We couldn't have chosen a better option! The hotel is absolutely beautiful... a perfect blend of luxury and comfort. Clean, comfortable and in a perfect location. The staff was friendly and accommodating, helping us with everything from directions and suggestions to retrieving our train tickets for us so we didn't have to waste that time. There is also a piano bar in the hotel, at which we had a great time listening to a talented and friendly musician. Finally, dinner at the hotel was no exception... after a long day exploring, it's nice to know you can have an authentic meal so close to home. We'll definitely be visiting La Maison Arabe again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Romantic Place,"Couldn't fault anything in the hotel, very good location only a ten minute walk to the main square, also gave free transportation to another pool, oasis area which was lovely. They gave excellent service and good quality food if you wish to eat there. The rooms were very clean and relaxing with a great view off the balconies. Very traditional Moroccan style round the whole hotel. They had a place called the hammam downstairs where I had a lovely relaxing massage and a full body scrub, definitely advice to go down there. The bar man was also very entertaining and very welcoming. also the reception staff were very helpful and spoke good english. Great place for couples to visit and have a romantic, relaxing visit.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Awesome!,"My wife and I recently stayed at La Maison Arabe for three nights. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the service is immaculate. It was a real pleasure to stay there and we were sorry to leave. The location of the hotel is excellent for visiting such attractions as the Souk, the Jemaa El Fna, La Koutoubia and the Marjorelle Gardens. The hotel also arranged a transfer from Marrakech airport (on arrival) and a transfer to our next hotel in Essaouria. Both worked very well.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,All in all a very good hotel experience.,"I had a wonderful time there the last 2 nights. The service was excellent, achieving that rare balance between attentive but not intrusive. I had a great cooking class with Fawa and her Dada, and I enjoyed the hammam and it's subdued, ethereal lighting. When I had just missed the last afternoon van to the secret gardens, the reception arranged a special trip to take me there! There is a nice small pool with olive trees in the center of the hotel (inside the medina!), with bigger pool with views of the atlas mountains on a clear day from the ""secret garden"".",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Wonderful stay!,"Everything about this Riad was perfect. Good location, beautiful hotel, clean, safe, good food and wonderful staff. Can't say enough about the staff.

We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,5,Perfect for kids,"We have just got back from 4 days in Marrakesh, we had been twice before but without children and stayed in small riads, this time we were travelling with our 6 year old. Maison Arabe couldnt have been a better choice. The staff were amazing, friendly, helpful and couldnt do enough to help. The country club was the perfect escape, our daughter loved it.... And although it was beautiful, it was the staff that made the time there so special. La Maison Arabe was the perfect Riad to stay with kids, close to the souks, great food, lovely room, and the country club, made a perfect combination...i cant recommend highly enough.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2013,5,"Gorgeous, Peaceful Riad in Heart of Media","The staff here could not have been more helpful with directions, tours, and dining. The breakfast is superb. The cooking class was beyond expectations- not only did we learn how to make chicken pastille in tagine (a common Moroccan dish), prior to the class we took a tour around the medina to see a local bakery, spice store, and butcher. The well-informed instructions spoke excellent english, and the kitchen was clean and beautifully arranged. Our room had a view of the pool- a true oasis the middle os the busy medina.

I would go back to Marrakech just to stay here. We loved our room, too.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Amazing Experience,"Very friendly staff (which is hard to find in Marrakech), excellent spa facilities and great dinning.

Definitely book a table by the pool to dine one night, the cuisine is incredible and very authentic. Looking forward to going back and taking my partner there!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Exquisite,"Few places tick as many boxes as this. A stunning warren of rooms in combined restored Riads right on the edge of the Medina. We were greeted by charming staff and a cocktail on arrival and the high standards never wavered throughout our stay. You have the choice of 2 classy restaurants, both with traditional live musicians as well as a welcoming bar. The underground hammam is an oasis of tranquility offering all spa treatments as well as henna for children. Regular shuttles to the nearby country club and it's cookery school are the icing on the cake.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2014,5,Wonderful Hotel,"With it's location in Old Town, excellent restaurant, old world charm and and modern amenities, the La Maison Arabe. was the perfect way to end our trip to Morocco.

 July 2014,5,Better than expected,"Ideal hotel for a stay in Marrakech, wasnt too expensive, located well in the Old town in a beautiful old building (although fairly anonymous from the street). Staff were great, rooms were great, food was lovely, spa was great. Arrived v late on Wednesday before going kite surfing in Essaouira - came back a day early to relax at the hotel as thought it was so nice on first night. Country club idea is hilarious and was perfect for spending last afternoon before heading to airport.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2014,4,"Quiet, comfortable refuge","A quiet refuge from the heat and busy streets of the Medina, the royal suites are perfect for a family with a king bed upstairs and 2 twins downstairs (with a bathroom on each floor). The 3rd floor terrace with a jacuzzi is the cherry on the top. The kindest most caring staff in the hotel are in the restaurants. The restaurant manager was particularly helpful and kind and is the one person who made our stay a joy. He offered a variety from the somewhat boring vegetarian menu for us (there is only so much vegetarian couscous and vegetable tagine you can eat!). And he made special food for our daughter when she became ill. The housekeeping staff were cheerful and hard working and their drivers for arranged rides were great. We also appreciated bell staff and security staff…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2014,5,Great service,"We had a lovely time at Maison Arabe, our first time in Marrakech. They looked after us really well and we made good use of the country club swimming pool.

I would recommend the spa as well, again lovely staff and a unique experience!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,I want to return!!,"We stayed at the Maison Arabe June this year. My summary : for us it was a magical stay. We traveled from Casablanca to Marrakesh by taxi, the driver got lost and we ended up very upset after being harassed by local teens, the only very unpleasant episode during our 3 weeks in Morocco. The staff was very comforting, and I must praise them for being the soul of the Riad. It was them that made from this lovely lodge the wonderful place it is. Totally dedicated to the comfort and well being of their guests. Each and every one of them. They were there but unobtrusive. Their advice was always correct and all arrangements in transportation, reservations and guides were done to perfection. Our room was lovely, large,separated into 2 areas with ample sleeping and seating space. …",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2014,4,Beautiful setting and excellent services,We stayed here after 2 weeks travelling through rural morocco and were in much need of a touch of comfort and luxury. Arabe did not let us down. We were upgraded to a suite - perfection. The pool on site was gorgeous but we didn't use this as the pool facilities off site were simply amazing and a short trip away. We ate here one evening and the meal was also delicious. Would recommend this hotel.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2014,5,Just Lovely,"I stayed at the Maison Arabe in February this year with my partner for a Valentine's day break. We had a suite on the first floor opposite the veranda overlooking the courtyard / dining area and the room was nice, large, clean and very airy; separated into 2 main parts with place to site and flat screen TV etc. There was a good balcony. The room was air conditioned and the décor / fixtures in the room were all well maintained / clean / in good order. The hotel itself is lovely - it isn't quite what you expect from the outside when you arrive. The staff are excellent and attentive, all seemed to speak good English. Reception was always manned by at least 2 people and they were very helpful (to the point of giving us a mobile phone with the Hotel's number stored in it when we…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 June 2014,5,Impressive,"We stayed at La Maison Arabe for three nights in mid-June and enjoyed every minute of our time there. The property is a tastefully renovated riad which used to be a restaurant and has expanded over the years. La Maison is now a well-oiled machine, one of the best hotels we have ever had the luck to stay in. The staff strive for excellence: receptionists, waiters, cleaners chefs worked relentlessly and efficiently to promptly respond to all our requests and made our experience unforgettable. We were impressed by the attention to details, the decor and the peacefulness of La Maison which strongly contrasts with the world outside.The Breakfast buffet was beautifully presented and hard to fault together with the two restaurants and the complimentary Moroccan afternoon tea. Our room…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2014,5,Best of Morocco,"Although I have stayed at this beautiful Riad more than 5 times, each time the hotel has expanded its amenities and service, but has lost none of the charm and personality that originally drew us here. This has been the favorite of every friend we have ever brought with us to this wonderful country--and it just gets better and better. Where to begin? First, although it had been five years since our last visit--the incredible bartender, Rachid, remembered us and greeted my family with delicious, fresh, and highly imaginative drinks while we filled out the paperwork by the stunning pool (the moment he saw me, he gave me a warm handshake and told me that he remembered I don't take my martinis with vermouth--he was right, I don't). Mourad, at reception, will go down in my memory…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 July 2014,5,Oasis of calm,"Thoroughly enjoyable stay. Nothing was a problem for the staff - who were ever-present yet unobtrusive (this indicates good training I suspect). Local advice proved invaluable from Reception Desk, trips arranged, taxis, calesh arranged, bags carried etc. Country Club pool and gardens are a total escape (and large enough to allow peace and quiet) with staff who were quiet and professional. Room was tidied every time we went out (!) fresh towels seemed never ending, air-con switched on ready for our return. It was the finer details of service which indicate high level of professionalism of the staff. The decor and smells in the hotel are mesmerising - the hotel is cavernous and presented a dillema about where to sit each night (many many nooks and crannies, with comfortable…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Long Week-end at La Maison Arabe,"In June 2014 I spent a long week-end at La Maison Arabe together with my wife, celebrating our 25 wedding anniversary. La Maison Arabe is a typical, but at the same time reinterpreted, riad, very charming and including a small swimming pool. Front Desk personnel, in particular their Director, were really very kind and useful to us. Restaurant is one of the best in Marrakech. Their country club, 10 minutes outside Marrakech, connected through a free shuttle, is really very nice, and we suggest you spend some hours in the mid of the day, andh that you visit the town in the early morning, or the late afternoon. Finally, value for money is really good",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

In the other direction further down the street to the edge of the Medina you will find locals shopping for everything! The Riad is a good size with great design, nice pool, excellent and friendly staff all round, great breakfast (by the pool) that keeps you going all day, free afternoon tea. Access to a country club 15 mins by shuttle with a bigger pool is very relaxing and the cooking class is worthwhile. Good hammam/spa but you can also easily find outside spas to try.

It was by far our favorite hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door and provided with a tour of the property. Totally treated like royalty. The rooms were spacious and gorgeous all with outside space too. The hotel is a beautiful property in an excellent location.

At the registration desk, Adil and Raja went out of their way to help us with boarding passes, arrangements at the spa and helping us stay an hour past check out until we had to reluctantly leave to go to the airport. The rest of the staff was just as helpful. Rooms were great-- good a/c, internet access, comfortable beds. We had rooms in the older part of the riad (213 & 214) which overlooked the garden- beautiful, esp if you like waking up to the sounds of birds . Setting for breakfast was poolside and memorable.

As soon as we arrived we were offered breakfast by the pool which we hadn't expected and then given a tour of the hotel by the manager. It is a beautiful place so calm and tranquil after the bustle of Marrakech which unbelievably is just outside the front door! Our rooms were great and looked out over the pool area. At night it looks magical with lanterns and candles lighting the pool and eating areas. We went to the country club each day which is a ten minute shuttle in the hotel people carrier.

This was definitely a highlight of our trip and an incredibly luxurious riad in the middle of the medina. Located just a few minute walk away from the main square of jamaa el fna, this place is everything you have read about and more. Because we were travelling on our honeymoon, we were upgraded to a suite which was large, impeccably decorated and extremely comfortable with a great view of the pool and poolside area. The staff, from start to finish, were so nice and generous. They always offered us some treat, or just a nice smile and asking us about our day and if they could do anything for us.

Rooms were spotlessly clean,every time we stepped out..as if there was a magic wand somewhere and the moment we stepped out of the room and returned our rooms were spotless again. The breakfast was great and so was the afternoon tea and cookies added with the room tariff. Free wi-fi in every room and a complimentary bottle of red wine and water was a great added gesture. The boys in the reception were really great and helpful.

The hotel really does deserve its fantastic reviews. From the moment you step through its front doors from the harsh heat and the bustle of manic Marrakech, you enter a true oasis of cool, calm relaxation and beautiful surroundings. The hotel is a small traditional 'Riad' (built around a courtyard; two small courtyards in this case), charmingly furnished and beautifully lit with hundreds of twinkling Moroccan lanterns and mirrors.

Great facilities and restaurant which we ate at all three nights(except when I was not well but my wife did) . Would highly recommend the La Maison Arabe for anyone travelling to Marrakesh and wanting a central riad. .,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2014,5,Best hotel in Marrakech,"This was definitely one of my all-time best hotel experiences - friendly, helpful staff, a comfortable room, nice pool, great location for exploring Marrakech, excellent restaurant, reasonable prices for food and other extras, breakfast and afternoon tea included in the room rate, gorgeous additional off-site pool and gardens when you want a relaxing break from the city. Very accommodating of our dietary requirements (vegan) too, which was an added bonus. Would definitely recommend and will definitely visit again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2014,5,Too good to be true??? It's true. It's that good!!!,We just stayed at Maison Arabes for 3 nights We really never write on trip advisor but wanted to share our fantastic experience This is such a wonderful Riad hotel in Marrakech that is a real privilege to stay at. It is a only a few minutes walk to the souk and main square which is such a colourful sight to see. But back to the Riad..The staff at Maison all become like family.( in a good way !!) So accommodating and amazingly friendly and so helpful Our spa experience was magical. As soon as you descend the stairs towards the spa you feel transported into another soothing world filled with hundreds of flickering candles. The 90 minute royal hammam treatment was incredible. Dinner was outside by the pool and was magical. The most romantic setting and great morrocan food…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2014,5,Such a lovely Experience,This place is everything everyone raves about. We loved every single detail and would recommend to everyone. We did the cooking class and not only had an amazing lunch but spent two magical days in the country club. Felt like royalty! 6 stars!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,"""The Surprise is Inside""","My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for three nights. There is a saying in Marrakech that the surprise is inside as most of the buildings look the same outside. Well, what a surprise we had! This is an absolutely beautiful small hotel inside the Medina and a short walk from the Souks, the square and other attractions. It is gorgeously decorated with art, rugs, lights furniture and artifacts. It has many sitting areas to relax and enjoy the interior. Our room had a working tiled fireplace and a large patio which looked down upon the pool below. The pool is surrounded by the outdoor dinning area which at night is lite up with Moroccan lights that create one of the most romantic dinning areas I have experienced. The Trois Saveurs restaurant is superior, eliminating…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2013,5,Extra ordinary everything,"We are amazed! Everything was just wonderful, the best hotel we have ever visited. Extremely good service, luxury interiors, the bathrooms are beautiful, good location close to the medina, peaceful. We attended the cooking class they offer, that was a life experience! The bar is professional. Strongly recommend that you don't miss out the afternoon tea. The home made yoghurt for breakfast is something you dream of the whole night and makes you jump out of bed of excitement. The country club is a great bonus to this hotel. They serve excellent lunch there. The Moroccan restaurant in the hotel is fabulous. We will come back!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2014,5,Amazing Riad,"La Maison Arabe is amazing. I stayed for a week in May with my mum. We had a lovely room with a balcony. It was very comfortable and had a large bathroom. From the moment we arrived the staff and service were exceptional. The staff were very attentive but in a discrete way. Breakfast was amazing and had a great selection. We ate at both restaurants and the food was wonderful, fresh and not over the top in price. We visited the Riad's Country Club which had a beautiful pool, comfortable sun beds and a very good lunch menu. This was a luxurious, relaxing holiday. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay and we will certainly be going back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,A must go....,"This hotel is fantastic!!! My sisters booked the suite for my 40th birthday for a quick 2night break. The room was fantastic, the food was fantastic and the service was too. All the staff went to such an effort to make our stay special. And on top of that they have a site 10mins out of the city centre with the most gorgeous pool and gardens. They provide a free shuttle bus every hour to get there and it's a real oasis. Cant recommend this hotel enough.. .enjoy!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Exceptional experience,"We took our three school age children over spring break and stayed at this wonderful riad at the beginning and end of our tour. The staff was excellent - accommodating, friendly, and wonderfully generous with the children. The accommodations were authentic with exceptional quality and comfort. The food was delicious and provided many options to experience morocco cuisine, but the staff was willing to do the little things for our sometimes picky kids. We also participated in the cooking school and that quite simply rounded out the visit, learning to make tagine and being introduced to the local spices and cooking techniques. The location was perfect for walking, and it felt safe and was as well marked as any hotel in the medina. We would without a doubt return to this riad…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,A Jewel!,"Our experience at La Maison Arabe was unparalleled luxury in an intimate, warm, friendly setting. Arriving after a long flight on a hot, hot day, we were escorted into a sumptuous, comfortable salon where we were provided frosty complimentary drinks made of lime, mint, and mango while they checked us in. Our magnificent room, the Hilal, over looked the garden pool, which was an oasis. Huge, tiled, beautiful bathroom with super-modern shower fixtures. Every staff member gave kind, personal, prompt, efficient service. Cooking school, where we made bread and chicken tagine and vegetables, was a joy. Steam bath and scrub were perfect, as were tea by the pool and 5-star European and Moroccan meals at the restaurants. Within walking distance of Jamaâ El Fna Square. Don’t miss…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Exceptional!,"I accidentally posted our review under my son's email - G Harrison - but wanted to reiterate here that the time at La Maison Arabe was unsurpassed. It has the luxuriousness of a large hotel in a smaller, cozy, welcoming environment. Delicious breakfast, wonderful cooking school, excellent service and assistance from all in the hotel - and superb location for touring and walking to the markets and the souk. We have rarely stayed, in all our travels, in a place that just seemed to get everything right each day. Very attentive and kind and personal. And architecturally lovely in every respect.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

I have never felt compelled to write a review before but La Maison Arabe deserves a write up. The riad itself was amazing. The smell - oh how I wish I could recreate this at home!, the ambience, the facilities. It was an absolute haven. The staff were brilliant. So smily and helpful and professional. We spent a day out at their sister hotel/ country club. There we did the cooking class in the morning which was great followed by an afternoon by the pool - again lovely. We all experienced a hamman at maison arabe as well as a massage. Again amazing. I wish we had longer and could go back every year. Be careful when leaving the road…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Amazing experience,"My girlfriend and I visited La Maison Arabe for four days last week. I am normally not one to write reviews on TripAdvisor (this is actually my first), but the experience was so fantastic, I thought that they deserved a little mention. I have traveled all over the world, and stayed at top-tier hotels for work and pleasure. This was one of my most memorable experiences! We were welcomed into a foyer, offered complementary drinks, registered, and shown the property (bar, solarium, hammam, restaurant). Surprisingly, we were upgraded to a suite upon arrival with a view of the patio with a beautiful aquamarine pool. The service was top notch. Everyone from the bell hop to the concierge offered impeccable, attentive service, while not being overbearing. The property itself…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Perfect!,"I have recently returned from a holiday in Marrakech with my school friend to celebrate our 50th birthdays. We had spent 'many an hour' flicking through brochures to narrow down our choices- did we want to stay inside or outside the walls? did we want a Rhiad or a chain hotel? We finally opted for La Maison Arabe and it was perfect. Situated just 15mins from El Efna Square, it was luxurious but friendly at the same time. The decor was traditional, the service efficient but appropriately relaxed. The self service breakfast table was plentiful and catered for all tastes, including a selection of homemade cakes, jams & marmalades. The jazz bar downstairs was home to a very enthusiastic barman, he was very attentive and accommodating. A word of advice, we found the aircon' here a…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2014,5,Wonderful week away to recuperate,"From beginning to end, we cannot speak highly enough of La Maison Arabe. The Riad was stunning and the accommodation is outstanding with standards of food and service to match. Adil and his front office staff could not have done any more for us, especially as unfortunately another guest was annoyingly noisy. The coup de gras however is the hotel's Country Club which offers an amazing tranquil environment away from the hussle and noise of the main town and madness of the souks. All in all would be very surprised if a better accommodation exists in Marrakech, especially being inside the Medina walls as this makes all of the sites of Marrakech within walking distance. Would definitely return and also recommend to anyone wanting to visit Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,La Maison Arabe Country club,"I needed to rest form the crazy Marrakech and I went for one day to the Country club of La Maison Arabe. If you are not sleeping at the hotel you can purchase a day pass fro 400 Dirham. A shuttle bus is bringing you for free to the country club, where you are given towels, a welcome drink and water. The lunch is also included in the daily price. The country club is simply beautiful, immersed in the nature.. everything was super clean and the service is excellent. Very attentive. I think the price is fair for the services offered.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,You will not be able to find a better hotel in Marrakech.,"We booked this hotel for a short break in June and and managed to get a two rooms. When we arrived we found that one room was in the old part of the hotel and one in the new part. From the start, picking us up from Marrakech airport to the drop off at the end they were faultless in their service level. For example we arrived late in the evening on the first night and they showed us to a sheltered court yard and provided us with a refreshing drink then showed us round the hotel. They were just so polite and kind. The breakfast is great and has fruit and cooked and prepared arabic crepes which were lovely. We decided to take a walk out and as this hotel is in the Medina area of Marrakech its really only a short walk to the souks. When we mentioned this to the reception they gave…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2014,5,Favorite hotel in Marrakech=La Maison Arab,"We stayed here at the end of a two week journey, for 3 days. This is possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we are widely traveled.

We will stay there again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Marveling at La Maison Arabe,"It is hard to think of a hotel where we have stayed, in all our travels, where everything was always 'right', but La Maison Arabe does everything well. We just finished a 3 night stay there, with our family of 5, and we found the experience fantastic in every way. The staff is kind, attentive, caring and ahead of the game. The rooms were luxurious and comfortable. The breakfasts were delicious, and were made more enjoyable by the pool side ambiance. The spa provided a welcome break and the cooking school was superlative. We attended the cooking school with our 2 high school age sons and friend and all of us enjoyed every aspect.

The city and all it offers was great and everything you would expect, to go with this break we wanted a really relaxed luxurious hotel/riad and we found the perfect place. La Maison Arabe is even better than we hoped. Starting with the staff - all friendly and very helpful, nothing is ever to much trouble. Two very good restaurants hard to pick between them but the Moroccan restaurant just had a little more style. In both restaurants the had gentle live music very in keeping with venue, playing instruments such as a Sitar. The piano bar was great and had a jazz theme going on with a very friendly head barman. All the decor everywhere was top quality and very Moroccan. They have an…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Elegant and Comfortable,"This Riad in the Medina is very friendly and beautiful. Upon our arrival, my party was greeted with delicious welcome drinks made by the bartender with cucumbers and mint. The rooms are gorgeous, my bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning very strong (it was over 100degrees F our first day). We tried the restaurant that night because we were too tired to go out. It was delicious and had live music. There is also a jazz bar and a swimming pool by the breakfast area. Breakfast is a delicious spread of continental style plus local fruits, dates, figs and prunes. They make a Moroccan crepe which is square and crunchy. We enjoyed it all. Look at the decor for an idea of what the well made, high end stuff you see in the Souks should be if you want the good stuff.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,A beautiful and authentic Riad in Marrakech,We stayed for three nights at this beautiful Riad in the centre of Marrakech. This was the most wonderful way to conclude our two week trip to Morocco and after staying in some wonderful places this was or favourite. The property is a great mix of an authentic Riad and a new section with a careful mix of Berber decor and modern conveniences. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food is excellent. We dined around the pool in the international restaurant each night but enjoyed classic dishes from the Moroccan menu. They also have a second property with a great pool where we spent an afternoon relaxing and taking lunch. We did not participate in the cooking classes but they are offered every day and feedback was very positive. This Riad delivered everything we expect…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2013,5,Excellent cooking classes!,I was at la Maison Arabe for their half day cooking classes. The place is absolutely beautiful and all the staff was very kind with us. The cooking classes are very interesting and - of course - focused on typical Moroccan dishes. They also took us to see how they make the bread and to taste the famous Moroccan mint tea. Not cheap but worth it!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,Oasis amid the dusty streets,"The service levels in this hotel is what you could expect in some of the top hotels of the world. The front of house staff and in particular the hotels manager ""Adil"" can not do enough for you, he will book you the best tables, organise trips and go beyond most to make sure your stay is as perfect as it can be. The hotels facilities are great. The country club gives the option of a large pool you would expect from a hotel yet the riads pool is large enough for a quick dip in the afternoon. The room we had (a delux double) was more than adequate, it had its own terrace area, lovely bathroom and large bed, it was located in a very secluded part of the hotel and have a great nights sleep. The breakfast was good serving both authentic Morrocan and more western dishes. At first I…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,"Take a taste of Morocco home with you, do their half day cookery course!","My husband and I did this on our last day. We weren't staying at the Arabe but had booked their cookery course independently. The course is done either in Cafe Arabe hotel or in their other premises 15 mins away by car. We did the latter. We were with two other people on the course so we got their full attention. The instruction was fabulous with video screens in front of you showing the 'Dada' (head chef) doing the cooking and the english speaking guide beside you helping you along the way. The food was fantastic and you are given a lovely surprise gift at the end to take away. We had a fabulous time doing this activity, you learn about the spices, the culture and you can recreate it when you get home!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2014,5,"I wish there were more stars to give, and days to stay.","La Maison Arabe is a charming boutique property that is in all ways world class. Every aspect of our experience from the welcoming hospitality, to the stunning architecture and interior decorating, to the room, to the restaurants to the spa was outstanding. The attention to detail (at check out they presented us with pre-filled out customs departure forms) and the service (on seeing us coming in from the souk the bartender prepared a refreshing nonalcoholic cocktail and brought it to our room) is superior to many five star properties. The location is quite central but it is an oasis of quiet and calm in a city that can be dizzyingly frenetic. This property also represents a solid value as the prices are well below most at this level. If I one criticism it would be…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2014,5,A ryad with atmosphere,"Make sure you're delivered to the door by a driver who knows the place because it looks unprepossessing and hidden away but once inside, it is magnificent. Also check your room positioning if you are not able to cope with many stairs; they do have alternatives but the highest rooms have the most facilities and sometimes even verandahs. The Arab meal was splendid - the traditional Moroccan salads of 5 or 6 plates were sublime with (for once) the right quantities instead of a surfeit! The breakfast staff are worth a mention too, being very helpful, attentive and courteous. The bar was not so good - a curious custom of wanting to know one's name as well as the room number, that is providing somebody is in attendance and then remembers your drink order. Overall first class.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

There are many public areas, bars, courtyards and garden areas to sit in, all peaceful and beautiful. We ate at the Moroccan restaurant on our last night and even after sampling tagines from all over Morocco over a two week period we thoroughly enjoyed it and the service was perfect.

 May 2014,5,Warm and Unique,Everything we experienced at Arabe was first class. The attention to detail was evident throughout our stay......from the rose petals in our room to the warm reception when we arrived. This Riad has lots of little hidden spaces where you can relax. We are a family of five with kids in the early 20's and they all loved this unique Riad. The food at both restaurants was very good but don't miss the Moroccan restaurant which is very intimate and has musicians playing during dinner. Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful. The Jazz Bar run by the incomparable Rashid should not be missed. Rashid is one of the best bartenders / hosts that I have seen. He is a huge asset to Arabe as he is really like an ambassador for this Riad. He is everywhere and has a great way…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2014,5,Outstanding,"Had a wonderful stay at this Riad, set in the heart of the Medina in Marrakech. Stayed in the Royal Suite Chems. It was a triplex with salon on the ground floor (which can be converted into a bedroom at night with its own full bathroom), a master bedroom with a full bathroom on the 1st floor and a lovely terrace with a hot tub on the top floor. The riad itself is lovely with a lot of character. Serves wonderful food which you can have in their courtyard by the pool. The front office manager , Adil, was very helpful and hospitable. Service is impeccable. We had massages in their hammam on both days and they were great. They also have their own country club on the outskirts of town, with a shuttle service. We did not try that.

 April 2014,5,Truly Incredible,"Never have I stayed at a hotel which so strongly reflected the beauty and craftsmanship of a country. From the tile floors to the moorish archway, the carved wood headboard to the Berber rugs, the recessed lights in the shape of the star of Solomon to the brass lamp hanging from the wall of the small terrace, every aspect of the room reminded us that we were in Morocco. The cooking class was really fun. Because the group was larger than some, it was held at the hotel's country club, about 20 minutes away. The group ate our lunch in the beautiful garden, which was lovely. Had we known that the class would be there, we would have brought along our swimming suits to stay by the pool and relax after lunch.

The services are very attentive and professional with a warm and joyful touch. The staffs are never hesitated to offer a kind help and useful guidance, which make my visit of Marrakech a wonderful trip. The cooking course is highly recommendable if you are interested to learn to cook moroccan food with style. I had my cooking class at the garden club.

 May 2014,5,The Right Choice for a perfect stay in Marrakech,Stayed at the La Maison Arabe for a week from 20 May 2014 and we were so pleased with the choice we made to stay at this outstanding Riad. We read all the reviews on trip advisor and we were delighted that all the glowing reports were more than accurate. Our stay at the hotel really helped to give us a truly authentic experience of Marrakech. We ate in both the Moroccan and the International restaurants and the food was amazing and we were surprised by the quality of the Moroccan red wine. What impressed us most was the staff – warm and friendly and real professionals. The service provided was excellent.

 October 2013,5,Outstanding,"On our last day in Marrakech, my wife and I decided we would return to MK on the offchance for lunch. Unfortunately (or fortunately) they were full. We chanced upon this unpretentious looking Riad nearby and were truly amazed. We were taken down to the restaurant which included a short tour of the hotel and were seated at a table beside the pool. What a truly idyllic location with excellent food, the staff were attentive and extremely friendly and the kitchen staff even took the time to have photos taken with geusts that were leaving. We were there for only a couple of hours but this place certainly left a lasting impression. We certainly plan to return and stay at La Maison Arabe in the near future, we just wish we had knownn about it before travelling to Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,The only thing missing was a magic carpet ride!,"In early, March, my romantic husband whisked me away for a weekend in Marrakech. He thoroughly researched the city, the restaurants and the hotels. He decided on a traditional riad in the heart of the city, as opposed to the modern, concrete and glass hotel chain option. A riad is a Moroccan house or palace built around an interior garden or courtyard. They are designed as a family home. All the rooms face the courtyard, atrium or the garden. Riads are peaceful, tranquil and luxurious with fountains and lush landscape. La Maison Arabe embraces all of the above. The welcome we received upon arrival made us feel like royalty.

 May 2014,5,Amazing Cooking Course!,"My boyfriend and I booked into the cooking course with Maison Arabe after it was recommended to us by another riad in Marrakech. We arrived not really knowing what to expect and waited in the beautiful courtyard of the riad before being driven to their 'ranch' just outside the city. This place was as beautiful as the riad itself; beautiful gardens, shaded outdoor tables and a modern kitchen well enough equipped for a tv cooking show. Wafa was a great host and she told us all about Moroccan culture and history before hosting the course with the Dada. I cannot recommend this course enough, we felt so welcomed and the food was delicious when we got to eat the fruits of our labour in the garden at the end of the course. Amazing!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2014,5,Outstanding!,"We stayed in some extremely nice riads in Morocco and this was as good as it gets. What makes this riad so outstanding is that it had absolutely the best service we encountered anywhere in Morocco - and pretty much anywhere else in the world for that matter, The service rivaled the Taj and Oberon hotels in India, and that says a lot! It is pricey but they deliver value for their charges. Jazz bar had a live pianist and was quite pleasant. Dinner there was excellent. I couldn't recommend it more highly.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2014,5,Looks lovely,"I didn't stay here (we stayed at Riad Kniza) but was torn between this and the Kniza so decided to have a look at whilst here. It is a lovely looking Riad. There are two big restaurants and a piano bar, as well as a large pool. We had afternoon tea and the service was very good. They were very happy to show me around too. So, for comparison purposes between Kniza and La Maison Arabe, I think it comes down to size! If you like a large hotel with facilities then choose La Maison. If you like an intimate hotel where you feel like you have the place to yourself then choose Kniza. We were happy with our choice - Kniza reviewed separately.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

It is intimate, personal and quirky: rooms are Moroccan ""home"" style and have been optioned up so they offer every possible comfort. The fittings and décor are high quality and the whole place has a luxurious feel without being brash. The restaurant is excellent. Worth a particular mention are the staff: the front desk is VERY good. Helpful, capable, professional and completely service oriented. Not one member of staff gave the sense that they were just doing a job. Every one excelled from the cleaning staff to the restaurant staff to the doorman. We are light sleepers and found the call to prayer obtrusive. We were moved (upgraded) without hesitation and had wonderful sleeps after that.

I would highly recommend this if you have the time. I also bought the cookbook which is not only a cookbook but also a wonderful tribute to this beautiful, world class hotel.

 April 2014,5,Our honeymoon destination,"We spent our honeymoon in this beautiful Riad. What can we say.... it was fabulous from the moment we stepped through the door. Traditional Morrocan style & décor, beautiful individually styled rooms, with all mod cons, which made this an oasis of tranquillity & peace. The staff were friendly, welcoming & attentive to our every need. The service was second to none. We dined in all the restaurants; did the cookery course, (which is not to be missed) and had 2 superb spa sessions which were the ultimate in luxury & relaxation. Murad (front of house) was a delight & couldn't do enough for us & Rashid made great cocktails in the Piano bar. We could not fault this place & will definitely be retuning again in the future. It is ideally situated within the walled city of Marrakesh, we…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2014,5,Fantastic cooking course,"My husband I attended a cooking course here in March, we had drinks at the hotel then headed out to their country club- really pretty surroundings, there was a talk on moroccian cuisine followed by tea and a visit to their bread stove we then made a chicken tagine and dip, and helped make desert. The Kitchen was really sophisticated and staff great fun afterwards you can eat the fruits of your labour- which tasted surprisingly good - if you like food this is definitely worth doing and a nice break from the crazyness of marrakech",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Fantastic hotel,"This was a business trip but everything about the hotel, it's staff and it'd food, made it feel like a holiday. Really traditional, don't be put off by the walk up an alley way to get to it, or the rustic feel when you go in. Give yourself ten minutes to switch into Morocan mode and you will love the relaxed, gentle, luxury of this place. One morning it got a little chilly, 17 degrees, so they even lit the lof fires on all the landings. What an experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,4,Beautiful Riad,"Very welcoming staff, beautifully decorated rooms, comfortable and clean.

 April 2014,5,Wonderful,"For a 3 day stay in Marrakech this hotel was wonderful. We loved everything about it - ambience, architecture, rooms (and we had 4 in all) bar, restaurant, location and most of all the staff. It was welcoming and every effort made to ensure our stay was as comfortable and easy as possible. We stayed for a special occasion and this was marked by the hotel staff in the restaurant which was a lovely touch. The breakfast buffet was superbe and the best for someone who is gluten intolerant. Absolutely loved this place and it made my Moroccan experience very special indeed.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,If you can afford-don't stay anywhere else for a true moroccan experience.,"This hotel is so beautiful and overflowing with Moroccan charm, from the marble tiles, courtyards with little fountains, comfortable sofas everywhere and the mood lighting in the bars etc. However it is the service that truly shines. We travelled with a baby and were upgraded to an amazing suite on top of the house with a number of rooms and terraces to give us plenty of room and the sun all day if we wanted. We did say after the first night that the suite patio side was a bit noisy for us as had two windows either side looking out on the street. This room was still gorgeous, but they upgraded us- no questions and were really nice about it as we felt bad saying anything, but wanted a more relaxing experience on holidays. The food is also fab and they recommended some great local…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,"Excellent location, very friendly staff","3 to 6 April 2014 A girly weekend break with family & friends, beautiful hotel & location. Reccomend using the hotel taxi service to & from the airport. The hotel staff were very kind & booked our taxis agreeing prices before we got in. Rooms were very clean with fresh flowers & towels daily. Had a wonderful time tried local restuarants which had music & entertainment. Pool was cold but sunbed area great with luxury sun longers. Buffet style breakfast had something for everyone. Staff always available & couldnt do enough for you. great stay. Local market very busy you should always barter never take first price.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Once again fantastic stay at La Maison Arabe!,"Following our amazing time last year we were keen to return this year. We had another truly memorable 7 night stay. The suite Jafaar was incredible. A double bed for our 13 year old daughter on a raised platform, a single bed for my son in the living area and a separate bedroom for my husband and I. Plus we additionally had our own private courtyard with two loungers and two chairs which was a lovely space for a bit of peace and quiet. Front desk assistance whether its booking a table at one of the hotel's excellent restaurants, taxis to the airport, trips to the desert or recommendations on where to visit was superb. Charming and efficient service with a smile thanks to all. We spent many a day at the Country Club where the charming service provided by Mohamed and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,La Maison Arabe,"A wonderful small hotel in the heart of Marrakech. Nice bedrooms, comfortable public rooms, a pool (too cold in March) and good food. The service is superb and all the staff, management included, go to immense trouble to give you exactly what you want. The private garden (20 minutes away by shuttle bus) is really relaxing and has an attractive pool as well. Not to be missed",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,"Great place, great hotel.",I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. It's location is excellent. The building is very authentic and the rooms extremely comfortable. The real joy was the staff who were very attentive and went out of their way to be as helpful as possible.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,4,Marrakech Paradise,"This is a wonderful hotel and I definitely recommend it. Because of its 5 out of 5 Tripadvisor rating, I expected it to be perfect and that may have set my expectations too high. I really want to give it a 5 out of 5 but it missed the mark slightly on a couple of occasions. It is beautiful inside - truly a paradise when faced with the chaos of the city. We had a suite that overlooked the pool and it was a gorgeous room. The only thing we were awaken by the call to prayer from the nearby mosque every night. I assume that you'd hear the same from any hotel in the city. I took a cooking class offered at the hotel and it was wonderful. Since there were so many of us signed up for the course, they held it at their ""country club"" facility where they have a state of the art learning…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Wonderful,"I booked this hotel through Kuoni for my Husbands 50th birthday and we were not disappointed. This is one of the most amazing and romantic hotels we have stayed in. It is a unique and charming boutique hotel where the staff are all so friendly, we really didn't want to leave ! We dined in the hotel restaurant both nights, the food was exquisite and the authentic moroccan music added to the romantic ambient atmosphere. They were also very helpful when we realised we left our car key behind in the safe, by delivering it to the airport before our flight home by a member of staff on a moped ! We will definitely return to this hotel for a mini-break in the future and have been raving about it to friends and family. Thank you everyone at La Maison Arabe for a truly wonderful and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Unforgettable,"This is a 5-star riad, and rivals any 5-star hotel I've experienced. The staff is incredibly accommodating.

You will truly feel you are in a different, wonderful world.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Short and sweet stay in Marrakesh,"I loved this hotel. It was very Moroccan: the décor and ambience seemed so authentic. The service was attentive bit not over the top (just as I like it). I was a sole female traveller and they catered well to my needs. I did the cooking lesson one day, which was professional and very enjoyable. I also had a hammam and massage which was amazing - definitely recommend it. I didn't get much time to explore Marrakesh, but the hotel seems reasonably central and is just 10 minutes walk from Djemaa El Fna.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Exceptional service,"Everyone seems aware of who you are. Everyone wants to anticipate your needs and does so with a smile. This is service at its best and it's lovely! La Maison Arabe is not quite in the mahem that is Marrakesh, but it is close enough to be accessible. Then you return to such lovely peace and luxury. They don't advertise their pool and gardens on the other side of town. A shuttle bus takes you there and you enter paradise. Again, everyone wants to please. Breakfast is not quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel, but the setting makes up for that. Hard to fault.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Excellent Stay!,"The moment you enter the premises, you know you're in for a treat.

 April 2014,5,Calm luxurious tranquil base in bustling Marrakech,"We stayed here for our honeymoon this April. Staff were incredibly helpful and courteous, offering us a welcome drink on arrival , a tour of the hotel and then on our 2nd day, a complimentary upgrade to a room with a private balcony including sheltered patio. Rooms were comfortable and luxuriously furnished, breakfast delicious although the coffee was a bit weak! We went to the country club twice during our stay which was also amazing , pool very clean. Hotel also sorted out our bus tickets for us for the onward journey to Essaouria and negotiated a good rate with the taxi driver for us. If I had to give any negatives? The Jazz bar piano player couldn't really sing and the night we ate in the Moroccan restaurant, we found the staff there a bit less helpful and smiley. They were…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,"Excellent Staff, Location !","I stayed here with a group of five for my sister's birthday. really close to the airport around £15. The hotel organised a taxi . The hotel had already been highly recommended . From the minute we arrived the staff couldn't do enough for us. The hotel was clean and oozing ambiance. The room were a sheer delight - even though ours was standard it was beautiful with a real Eastern touch. Spa was amazing after a day at the souks. Perfect location for the souks and would definitely recommend the red tourist bus to get a feel for Marrakech. Great location ,friendly helpful staff and a perfect hotel on all accounts. Will definitely be returning !",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Excellent cooking class,"My husband and I recently took a cooking class at La Maison Arabe and it was a wonderful experience. I often take a cooking class when I travel and this was one of the best I've ever participated in. All of the instructors were friendly, accessible, and very knowledgeable. The class was well organized and well paced, and lunch outside in the garden with wine pairings for the various courses we prepared was delightful. Highly recommended!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Excellence,"We booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews in Tripadvisor and we were hopeful that it would be a nice place to stay. It surpassed all our expectations. We spent 4 nights in a lovely suite with its own private courtyard. The hotel location is excellent, the hotel itself is lovely and the food in both restaurants is very good but the staff are the stars. They were always smiling and couldn't do enough for us. The country club is well worth a visit and we spent a lovely afternoon there. But be warned - we bought 2 carpets and a light fitment in the Medina which we neither needed or wanted!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Amazing in every way!,"I give this hotel the highest possible recommendation. In absolutely every way the La Maison Arabe was amazing. Every employee from the manager to housekeeping was friendly and accommodating. The beds were very comfortable, the good was delicious and the hotel is magical. We stayed in two hotels in Marrakech and this was the best in absolutely every respect.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Wonderful,This may be the most lovely hotel I've ever stayed in. The decor and furnishings are beautiful. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is excellent both in the restaurant and in the Jazz Bar. I had a treatment in the Hammam - another experience! I cannot fault this hotel in any way other than to say there are a lot of stairs which may be a problem for the less mobile. It's position is good - about 10 minutes walk to the square.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Great little find,"Thoroughly enjoyed my 4 nights at this hotel. Rooms are comfortable, room service is excellent, breakfast by the pool every morning was delicious.

 April 2014,5,Amazing Riad,"We really enjoyed our stay at La Maison Arabe. Adil, the manager, took wonderful care of us. We were there to celebrate my mother's 75th birthday and he arranged for a complimentary cake in the delicious (and famous) Moroccon restaurant on the first night we arrived. All of the staff were super helpful with directions and suggestions. I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to go back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,One of the best hotels I have stayed in,"La Maison Arabe was a truly wonderful experience. We had a mini-suite overlooking the pool and restaurant - it was beautiful, very comfortable and well appointed. The food was excellent - we had the Monkfish Tagine twice as it was a truly superb dish. One day we went to their 'County Club' (a 20 minute free bus ride away) - entry was free for hotel guests. On arrival we were provided with a hat, towels and a complimentary drink. The gardens and the pool were wonderful - the lunch was delicate and beautiful served amongst the trees. The hotel's location was excellent, less than ten minutes walk (through truly Moroccan streets) to the main square and the Souks. However, the best thing about La Maison Arabe was the staff - they were always on hand to offer advice and assistance,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Luxury and a gastronomic haven,From the moment we walked we were family. The management is always present and the staff seek out ways to please. We had a junior suite traveling as parents to a 14 year old boy. The accommodation was very spacious and loved the terrace overlooking the pool. Restaurants were both terrific and my husband and I really enjoyed the cooking class making chicken pastilla.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Lovely spa treatments and nice bar.,"We booked Spa treatments at La Maison Arabe and they were lovely, the staff were very accommodating as there were 11 of us and we all had different requests. Be aware that if you go as a group and you want a Hammam you will need to know each other pretty well as you will all be virtually naked! I didn't have a massage but those who did said it was the best they had had. The bar outside was also very nice, for those who like wine, the Moroccan wine is very good.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2014,5,Great food and spa!,"So we were staying at the most expensive resort in the city (La M) but our guide recommend this hotel for traditional hammam and lunch. The spa experience was great did with whole family (college age kids ,separate shower times) fraction of the cost from our resort. Lunch was the best food we had the entire 10 days in Morocco not pricey. Would stay here next time!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Excellent staff transforms problem to positive guest experience,"My wife and I together with two Norwegian friends stayed at La Maison Arabe for 3 nights from March 22. We were extremely satisfied with the hotel: Top location; very elegant interior with lots of beautiful Moroccan art and antiques, and excellent restaurants. Our very fine deluxe rooms on the second floor had bconies overlooking the pool. The hotel staff is outstanding in their friendly hospitality and professionalism. An example to illustrate this: One afternoon a written message told all guests that due to constructiion work in the neighbourhood (completely out of hotel control), there was a risk that the hotel the next day would be without electricity 4 hours from 9 AM to 1 PM. Accompanying the message was a bottle of French champagne in a cooler. This way of making…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,A dream,"we stayed 5 nights at La Maison Arabe and enjoyed an unrivalled hospitality. The staff extremely friendly, knows exactly what you would like to have, the rooms individually decorated, you feel like in a very well off private house. The kitchen is excellent!

 March 2014,5,Unrivalled service,"Spent four nights at La Maison Arabe and had one of the best hotel experiences ever. The staff are delightful, and nothing is too much trouble.

We had a hammam and massage at the spa which was good value and very relaxing.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Wonderful hotel,"My wife and I stayed at La Maison Arabe for 3 nights before going out for some nights in the Atlas mountains. I do lots of international travel globally for my work but I really cannot speak highly enough of this hotel - for individuality, cleanliness, service and food quality it is almost certainly my number one hotel. We arrived in the evening and were picked up by the hotel car to take us to the hotel. The arrival is a bit disconcerting as you park on a roadside in the city and the staff take you down a narrow lane to the hotel entrance which is very low key and you may think what have you come too. However, on entering the hotel lobby you enter another world of charm, traditional furnishing and luxury hidden away from the bustle of Marrakech's narrow lanes. The staff…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,Simply the Best!,"Possibly the best small hotel in which we have ever stayed. As you walk thru the front door, the decor exudes charm. The staff are professional, courteous, and are always attentive. In addition to a superb breakfast, we had lunch and dinner at this hotel and were pleasantly surprised, not only by the quality of food, but also a reasonable price. Suggestion for seniors, book a deluxe room, since the standard rooms can be a bit tight.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,4,Maison Arabe,We spent two and a half weeks in Morocco and this was by far the best place we stayed. A little difficult to navigate but that added to the charm.

 March 2014,5,Cookery Class Experience,"I have just come back from doing this class on 15th March. It was a fantastic experience I loved it and would highly recommend it. Wafa was great and the the two female chefs were so good and also great fun. I really enjoy cooking and feel I have a good knowledge base but learnt a great deal. The group we were with were interesting and great fun, having lunch together at the end and eating what we had all created was very nice. We had a graduation certificate presentation at the end and we were given a small tagine each......so well organised and what a beautiful kitchen space and setting.....a fabulous experience. .",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,"Exquisite Riad, Perfect Service","My wife booked a 3-night stay at La Maison Arabe as a birthday surprise for me -- she couldn't have chosen a more perfect hotel. From the moment the porter stepped up to take our bags, as we approached somewhat nervously down the unassuming alley, we experienced the most professional, discreet and yet friendly service from all the staff. Having been greeted with a welcome drink in the delightful Salon de The courtyard, we were taken on personal tour of this intimate and beautifully appointed riad, culminating in the introduction to our fabulous courtyard suite, adorned with scattered rose petals. We couldn't wait to experience the luxurious spa and booked in straight away -- I'd personally recommend the Beldi hammam and massage session as the perfect way to spend a couple of…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

With many wonderful options to choose from, my friend through in a last-minute request for a proper pool to swim lengths in. La Maison Arabe seemed like the obvious choice, and I'm very happy we chose it. Close to the edge of the old city, it's easily accessible, being only 50 yards or so from where the taxi we arranged through the hotel stops. We were greeted by the first in a long line of charming and helpful staff who took as through to the internal courtyard to drink sweet tea and eat biscuits while we checked in. We were then taken to our room, which was spotless, beautiful and certainly the most characterful i've ever been in (it has a tagine-shaped wall at the heart of it.). I…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

A beautiful interior and delightful dining room where we enjoyed one of the best meals of our tour. Staff were very friendly and helpful if rather thin on the ground at breakfast! A management issue. A minor niggle in an otherwise perfect stay. Go there and soak up the atmosphere.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 February 2014,5,feeling at home,"What more to say? Stayed a full week and we really felt at home! Never happened in our life full of travelling. Very nice, helpful and multi lingual (even Dutch!) staff, the room and bed(!) were spacious and clean. The food was excellent, wifi and tv were state of the art, the swimming pool was heated, and a trip to the gardens (free transfer) was also an experience worth while. We loved the intimate atmosphere of a small hotel and the decoration was what you should expect in a top riad. Authentic and not overdone. Like staying with friends. By the way la Maison Arabe has an exquisite shop where they have made a pre-selection of all the good souvenirs of Marrakech. Furthermore the location is close to all interesting places in and around the medina and if they are still too…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2014,5,An Oasis in a Magic City,"All in this HOTEL is special, every employee treats guests with a heartfelt smile, the suite we occupied was 242 (THE NADA SUITE), was perfect.

All kinds of goodies were offered as well as omlets, fried eggs etc. We went for dinner at one their restaurants, the morrocan one, and ate a leg of lamb to die for. The staff was always attentive to every one of our needs to the point of having their porter take us to the corner to pick up our pick up vehicles.

 March 2014,5,Utter bliss,"Visited La Maison Arabe Spa on the last day of my trip to Morocco this week! I went with a good friend of mine and we thought we'd indulge after hours of relentless (and amazing) sightseeing! We chose a Hammam treatment with Gommage followed by a massage. The place is just beautiful and you are instantly immersed into a relaxing, aromatic atmosphere guaranteed to soothe. If you are having a massage you can pick your oil out of a delightful selection they will have laid out for you. They will also explain how everything will work. The Hammam is essentially a really good sauna, the Gommage is a really good scrubbing and you also get a lovely hairwash so you are squeaky clean and relaxed.

 February 2014,5,A Hidden Treasure in the Heart of the Medina,"We had arranged for a taxi to pick us up at the airport and take us straight to the Riad. It dropped us at the end of an alleyway, and we wondered what we were in for! As we were later to find out, the Riad, as with many other buildings in Marrakech, revealed behind the walls was a superb hidden oasis! We were warmly welcomed by the manager, and because we were a little early for check in, were treated to refreshments in one of the lovely courtyards. We were shown around the entire Riad and then to our room, which had a balcony, overlooking the pool and outdoor restaurant. The room was perfect, clean and welcoming.

 February 2014,5,Great stay - again,"This was our third stay at La Maison Arabe, and once again the beauty of the place and the quality of the staff continue to impress. All the other reviewers who praise this hotel rightly identify what it is that makes people love it. It truly is an oasis in the chaos of Marrakech and there isn't anything the staff won't reasonably do to make your stay more comfortable. They really are terrific. The management have made a couple of changes that we personally didn't like to do with the patio area, where they have constructed private verandahs which now occupy the space where a lovely little patio existed previously and we didn't think the menu in the Trois Saveurs restaurant was as varied as it could have been.

He had a smile at all time. He did his best to accommodate us. The riad was in the old medina and we were going to go for palais de congress but after My husband and I and the kids met Adil we changed our mind. He took the time to give us a tour and also to explain every little detail about the riad from the artwork to the wood work. We were so thrilled that we cancelled our reservation to stay here. We were not disappointed, he kept checking on us and even the kids loved him My Julie and Elias kept asking where is uncle Adil.

This is a truly gorgeous character hotel in a great central location in the Medina, which gave us the flavour of Marrakech we wanted, combined with making life easy for us as first time visitors so that we explored and did all we wanted to do without feeling that we had been ripped off. From our welcoming and very personal check-in while sat on sofas, enjoying the peace and beauty of one of the many candlelit courtyards with free welcome drinks after the busy and hot wait to go through Passport Control at the airport, the staff generally were excellent and very kind.

We had an airport pick up which I would recommend, then we were welcomed by all the staff and whisked off for a delicious welcome cocktail - Virgin mojito I think - prepared by Rachid the talented head barman. Our pool view suite - Nars - was spacious and beautifully appointed. Wifi was brilliant. Breakfast round the pool was so pleasant. The fresh juices are delicious and really recommend the Moroccan ""pancake"". Enjoyed drinks in the jazz bar before dinner in the Moroccan restaurant which was a real highlight.

Excellent location, just at the gate of Medina and walking distance to major sights and restaurants, so after soaking up the city, we can quickly walk back to the hotel/riad and freshen up. For me, the hotel gives even more Moroccan feeling than outside on the streets. The interior is authentically and beautifully decorated, doors and drawers in real leather, rooms are very cozy, and overall the hotel exudes elegance. Most importantly, the staff and service are tip top! They anticipate your every needs, from making up rooms EVERYTIME you go out, to organizing excursions or even just taxi services.

 February 2014,5,Wonderful short break in Marrakech,We stayed at La Maison Arabe for a short break from 12 Feb 2014 to 15 Feb 2014. We had booked a deluxe suite with a patio and were kindly upgraded to the Royal Suite (227) by the manager upon our arrival. The room was spledid with a private terrace and whirlpool tub which allowed us to relax in solitude and enjoy the sun for a few hours each afternoon after walking through the medina. The location was perfect - not too far from everything but quiet and tranquil within the walls and courtyard of the property. The food at the two restaurants was of very good standard and the staff were always attentive and accommodating. The restaurant recommendations were very good as well. Thank you La Maison Arabe for a wonderful holiday. We hope to be back again next year!,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2014,5,Luxurious!,"Absolutely everything we encountered at Arabe was first-rate. Absolutely gorgeous, very relaxing; the service in every aspect was superb from front of desk to restaurant. And speaking of restaurants, the food was fantastic. Best yogurt ever for breakfast, delicious tea service in the afternoon (welcome after a day of walking the souks), and the international restaurant was outstanding. Can't recommend it highly enough!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2014,4,Nice boutique hotel,The hotel is very good. The decoration is great. The hotel is made of a few adjacent houses and is full of character. The rooms are beautiful. A place with character and in the middle of the Medina. We had a good time in this hotel.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2014,5,Exceptional in every respect,We were in Marrakech for the celebration of a friends birthday and were truly impressed by La Maison Arabe. Marrakech has no shortage of upscale hotels but it will be hard to topple the experience of this small Riad. From welcome drink to check-out we could not find any fault in this magic place inside the walls of the medina. There are many well appointed public spaces to relax and forget the outside world. The food was great and the breakfast buffet extensive but the best was the staff dedicated to service with a smile. Our spacious suite overlooked the pool and our bed was adorned with rose petals upon our arrival. All in all it was one of the best hotel stays we had anywhere.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2014,5,Fantastic restaurant,"Excellent food, wonderful ambiance and fantastic service . We were extremely well looked after. The waiters were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.Can't rate it highly enough. A wonderful find.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,One of the best places I've ever stayed!,"This was our last stay on our Morocco trip, and what a wonderful way to end the trip. Everything from our room to the service to the food were beyond fault. We stayed in the Noor Suite, which was huge with two terraces. The room was absolutely lovely. We could not have been more impressed with the breakfasts, which had an array of options to choose from. What I loved most was the woman who made crepes to order with various ingredients. Those were SO amazing. We were here for New Year’s Eve and loved the party they organized, with a tasting menu/wine pairings and lots of traditional musicians. At midnight the entire staff came out to the patio with drums, singing and chanting. It was special to be a part of their celebration. The service was superlative. They provided us with…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,An amazing experience!,"La Maison Arabe is situated just inside the old city wall and so is a fantastic location to see the old delights of Marrakech and the new city. From the time we arrived to the time we left the staff were welcoming, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The service was truly excellent! The hotel itself was exquisite- clearly a lot of thought and care had gone into creating this beautiful traditional Riad. The food and service in the two restaurants was also second to none. If you want to spend time in luxurious surrounding with excellent service, eat great food and drink good wine and pamper yourself in the beautifully appointed hammam, La Maison Arabe is the place to go. We will definitely be going back later this year. It was an amazing experience!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2014,5,A hidden gem,"We were recommended the restaurant of La Maison Arabe by a fellow guest at our Riad and we were not disappointed. Although we weren't staying here we could see how well appointed the hotel was, and we were treated like honoured guests just coming for a meal. The choice on the menu was excellent as it took into account people weary of tagines and brochettes, and the little lights given to help read the menus were a nice touch, as the restaurant is quite dark. That is not a complaint by the way - the ambience is delightful. Just keep in mind though that this is going to be more expensive than street food in Jemaa El-Fnaa. Attentive services with excellent food and wine and beautiful surroundings made our evening here a delight. Highly recommended.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,Unbelievably Good Service -- Sets the Bar,"I had the distinct pleasure of staying at La Maison Arabe and spending a few days with enjoying the service. If I good give a place a sixth star I would, their service makes me want to go back and reevaluate all my prior reviews. I arranged for transfer from the airport, and was met promptly by my driver. The hotel entrance is located on a quiet little allyway a short walk from the road. On arrival, I was treated to mint tea and allowed to relax in the salon while they dealt with my paperwork/passport. There was a fire going in the salon and it really felt like I had just come home. There are two adjoining salons, one done in traditional decorations, which I really liked, and a modern one. I then received a wonderful tour of the hotel from one of the front desk…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2014,5,Best hotel I have ever stayed in...,"I cannot fully express how incredible this hotel is! I stayed for 3 nights with my girlfriend and we both found it very difficult to leave. La Maison Arabe is truly a magical and surreal place. While the amenities, decor etc... were top notch what stood out to the both of us was the staff. They were the friendliest most helpful group of people I have ever been around. They truly seem to derive happiness from serving their guests.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2014,5,the best in marrakech,"Have just spent 8 idyllic days at La Maison Arabe, a most beautiful riad in the Medina. The service was so friendly and superb, both restaurants serve wonderful food, both Moroccan and international. The public rooms and the bedrooms are beautifully decorated in gorgeous colours, We will return next year and can't wait to enjoy it all again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,A haven,"Just returned from a short break to Morocco, made perfect by our stay in this great hotel. The atmosphere is warm and friendly and our suite was lovely with its little private courtyard. The staff are wonderful, food is delicious, and the location ideal for exploring Marrakech. On our first day, my husband opted for the souks while I had one of the best massages I've ever had. He returned slightly frazzled, to find me in a blissed out glow, and immediately booked a hammam treatment for himself! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,WOW!!,"I booked this hotel as a birthday gift for my husband, he's a bit of a hotel snob so was worried about his reaction on arrival. Well, in his own words ""This is the best hotel I have stayed in!"". A short walk up an alleyway leads to this amazing hotel, once through the door you are greeted by the friendliest staff we have come across. This hotel really is stuff dream are made of, the food is amazing which is backed up by the supreme service (Michelin star quality); the room we stayed in was a touch of Morocco, the feel and comfort was unsurpassed; the Hammam & Massage was the best and to top it of the location was perfect. They also went out of there way to help me arrange multiple surprises for my husband and make the holiday perfect which it was. If you stay in Marrakech…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,Outstanding hotel,"This hotel has the best service you could expect to find of any top class hotel anywhere in the world. It is beautifully decorated with very comfortable rooms, excellent hospitality, and 2 very good restaurants. The staff go more than the extra mile to make your stay welcoming and memorable. Would definitely stay there again despite not having tried other hotels in that city, I would just not bother investigating other hotels.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,Highly Recommended!!,"Really lovely hotel, interesting decor, super attentive staff and wonderful service. Stayed in a suite. Rooms are of a decent size. Bathrooms are spacious, water pressure was decent, though the shower heads look a little aged. Room service was amazing, you can basically order whatever you want from the restaurant menu and have it served to your room. As for breakfast, like dinner, you can order anything that they serve at the breakfast buffet to your room if you prefer the privacy. The hammam and massage treatments were pretty good too. Location wise, the hotel is around 10-15 minutes walk (depending on your walking speed) to most of the attractions - square, gardens etc... Service was really good, late checkout was provided in another room nearby Overall, this hotel is highly…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,Fantastic,"We stayed for a week in January, knowing the sun wouldn't be guaranteed at this time of year. What a fabulous hotel! Technically a riad, but not like any other I've stayed in. The buildings are beautiful, well kept with fires in the many open fireplaces throughout the place when it's chilly outside. 5 houses originally, now combined incredibly well into the Maison Arabe, Some real history here too. Rooms traditionally decorated with some very nice unique if maybe, quirky features. Room was plenty warm enough on the cold nights. Magnificent bed looking up into a vaulted, domed roof. Super bathroom with excellent shower. Breakfasts as good as any I've ever experienced, from dates, figs & preserved pears through eggs cooked anyway you want them in front of you, sausages, home made…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,Beautiful hotel tucked away in a side street in Marrakech. Amazing service and great good.,"Highly recommend this place. From the moment we walked in the staff was friendly, attentive and helpful. You are greeted with Moroccan mint tea in their beautiful lounge that has a fire place. The room we were in was perfect. It was a little small but it had everything we needed. We took the cooking class as well and it is a must.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,An amazing experience,"What a place! An authentic riad ""the first one in Marrakech "" where from the door step of the entrance you feel like a home away from home. The labyrinth concept makes you enjoy every corner of this axing house. Every piece, painting, furniture is just well thought! The staff are so friendly with great attitude that you are so well looked after and in the same time you are not disturbed and they respect your privacy and intimacy. The interaction between the staff, reflect the perfect harmony of this house. Food is wow and always a new touch makes you come back! The must for my wife is for sure the ""cooking class"" where you are welcomed by both Wafaa and chef Fatiha who takes you on a culinary trip full of senses! Definitely something to try while staying in this house or in…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,a wonderful and relaxing stay,"the place is beautifully decorated, the experience in the restaurants and spa is wonderful, staff is adorable and very caring.... our dream is to come back at least once a year, inch'Allah ! I do recommend you La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,A very homy riad,"Staying at La Maison Arabe is truly an amazing experience. The service was superb, the atmosphere was unique. Each and every piece of the decoration is carefully selected and placed which, shows owner's grate taste of art. It is a place where we wanted to live in, were it feels so home. In the La Maison Arab, food is out of this world, it was one of the best we've ever had. Moreover, the spa and the hammam's atmosphere takes you to a different world as well as the professionals there. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was so friendly and inviting. We will definitely recommend the riad to our friends and family next time they are in Marrakesh.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,SUPERB IN ALL RESPECTS,The Maison Arabe hotel and restaurant were both excellent It is well located to explore Marrakech on foot. The service was excellent. The staff were friendly and professional without being over the top. The room was perfect .Breakfasts by the pool were very good and the dinner we had in the restaurant Les Trois Saveurs was excellent . The wine list is good. The spa treatments were of a high standard I cannot praise it highly enough.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,They have it all!,"Most of the restaurants we review may score highly on food or location or service but rarely all 3. Our evening at Maison Arabe was outstanding on all 3! We nearly booked to stay there this time and on the basis of our visit tonight, we know for sure where we will book for any return stay in Marrakech. In just a 2 hour visit tonight we were made to feel more welcome than we have in our 3 days at our hotel ( that review will follow) Nothing was too much trouble and the standard of service was friendly and pleasant from front of house, to bar staff and waiting staff. These people have really got it right. It takes more than a nice pool and nice grounds or good location for a hotel and restaurant to lure people back. We will go back and so will you once you visit!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,Just lovely.,"We stayed here for four nights and have enjoyed every minute. The premises are superb, but even the most palatial of places can only be as good as the people who work there; from the doorman to the chambermaids to the senior managers, we can only speak in the most positive terms. La Maison Arabe has given us a wonderful holiday. We are not home yet and already I'm wondering how soon we'll be back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2013,5,A superb Christmas break.,The Maison Arabe certainly did not let us down. We arrived 24 hours late because of the foul weather in Britain before Christmas. The service in the hotel was brilliant and nothing was too much trouble for the office staff. Much to my surprise the emigration departure forms had been filled in saving the chore of having to wrestle with forms and hand luggage at the airport! Should the opportunity to visit Marrakech again it would certainly be to stay at the Maison Arabe.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2013,5,A Perfect setting for a family Christmas 2013,It was everything we had hoped for and more . Apart from the comfortable setting and perfect location it was the staff that really made the stay very special. Nothing was too much trouble and they all took the time to get to know us over the week. Smiling at every turn. Thank you.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,Fantastic,"Morocco is a country full of rich culture. Life in Morocco is full of contrasts, whether it be people, colors at the markets or the accommodation . Arriving in Marrakech, which is full on, hot, busy market places and many sites to see. It was a wonderful relief to arrive at La Maison Arabe. It is the oldest Raid in Marrakech and it is full of charm, and old world delights. The windy stairs to the beautiful spacious apartment or the jazz Bar, or the most amazing experience at the restaurant. Everything here is sincere, the people who work here, truly love to share the experience with you. Nothing is too much trouble. The service is impeccable, everybody wants to have you smile and enjoy the experience. That's exactly what we did.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2013,5,A gracious and comfortable property in the Marrakech Medina,"My wife, 16 year old son and I spent five nights at La Maison Arabe in December, 2013. The hotel came highly praised. Our experience did not disappoint. The setting: La Maison Arabe is near the edge of the Medina in Marrakech. That makes it relatively easy to get to upon arrival (or by vehicle) – but also perhaps makes the experience just a little less exotic than that of some of the other properties (say, Maison MK) that are deeper into the Medina. That said, it was plenty exotic enough for us. It is comprised – we were told – of 5 separate riads (walled houses built around courtyards) that were combined into a single hotel. The “patio” side of the hotel is original (older, more maze-like spaces), while the “garden” side is of new construction (and actually separated…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,Absolutely Fabulous! Outstanding!,"I have travelled worldwide and La Maison Arabe is definitely one of my favourites! We had The Royal Suite with a private terrace and jacuzzi . The staff were wonderful and we were treated really well. Taoufik and Adil took especial care of us, and trust me we were difficult clients! ( five girls ) From start to finish, the break was fantastic. The staff took care of our reservations for nights out, taxis, advise of places to see and a trip to The Atlas Mountains. We had fresh flowers in our room and afternoon teas. - the holiday was made special by the hotel. I would definitely stay at La Maison Arabe again! Thank you Taoufik and staff for all your kindness",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2013,5,Dinner was fabulous!,"My mother, sister and I had dinner there while we were in Marrakech for the holidays. While the walk down the alley to the restaurant seemed a bit shady, Maison Arabe staff went out of their way to make us feel safe and welcome. The menu was overwhelming. So many choices. It was hard to choose. The wine was also excellent with a good wine selection. No matter where you are staying in Marrakech, take one evening to go to Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2014,5,Stunning food and service,"We ate there last night. The bar is more fun than the fine dining and you are not restricted on the menu options. We were spoilt for choice, the menu was so varied. The atmosphere was relaxed with a piano player who nearly hit all the right notes.... Food and service were fantastic, highly recommended, it doesn't get its number one status for nothing! We'd most certainly stay there next time as by day the hotel and amenities were first class.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2013,5,Outstanding!,I had the pleasure to stay at La Maison Arabe as part of a birthday party and I was most impressed by the service and friendliness of all their staff. It is very homely and individual and I would recommened this wonderful hotel to anybody. It was the absolute highlight of my Marocco holiday all the way from Australia. Thank you very much.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2013,5,Wonderful characterful hotel in Marrakech!!,"Of all the hotels we have stayed at, La Maison Arabe it's the only one we stayed twice. The hotel has two parts. The older rooms are full of character and nicely decorated in the old part of the building, the newer part of the hotel has more modern rooms, which they are also lovely but more modernly decorated. The restaurant at the hotel is really good, would recommend to try it if you have time, as there is so many good places to eat in Marrakech... It also worth going to the out of town gardens and pool belonging to the hotel, there is a complementary bus service and its a nice place to visit and relax. No need to say, that if we ever go,back to Marrakesh we'll be staying in La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,Best hotel of the trip,"We stayed here with two other couples as part of a Moroccan tour and it was the best of the trip. Our room overlooked the pool and restaurant area and had views of the nearby mosque. The service here was simply the best. Staff at the front desk knew our names immediately and treated us to a healing rosemary, thyme and lavender tea when we mentioned we had stomach troubles. Our room was spacious with two flat screen TVs, a wonderful bathroom, great WIFI connection, and a comfortable bed. We simply loved it here!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2013,5,The very best Moroccan food in Marrakesh,"This restaurant is the very best genuine Moroccan food you can have in Marrakesh at the most beautiful Ryad in a decor and atmosphere that complete the experience to a level you will not find anywhere else. We have been to other top rated restaurants in Marrakesh during our trip but this one is our #1. The service is impeccable , the live music is a charm and the Moroccan wine list is a great treat.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Fantastic hotel - service par excellence,"My girlfriend and I spent four fantastic nights here recently for my 50th birthday celebration. Marrakech was wonderful and exotic, and the hotel made our stay equally memorable. We had read the good reviews before making our booking, but the hotel surpassed our expectations. The service, from the moment we arrived to when we left, was exceptional - all the staff was friendly, attentive, and nothing was too much trouble. I have stayed in a lot of top hotels around the world - La Maison Arabe ranks as one of the best, in terms of service. They have managed to combine luxury with that special, personal touch. All the little touches, that many institutions find so difficult to accommodate, seem to come naturally to the staff here. Nothing was too much trouble. For example, when…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2013,5,Wedding Anniversary break,"We've just returned form a fabulous long weekend in Marrakech, staying at La Maison Arabe. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite, and shortly after our bags were delivered our fresh complimentary cocktails arrived. This was a lovely room, and nothing was too much for the friendly and courteous staff. We enjoyed an excellent meal in the traditional Moroccan restaurant on site. the highlight was the Moroccan cookery class we signed up to on our last afternoon. This was the highlight of our trip - and we enjoyed the results after the end of the course. A lovely hotel that is a little bit of luxury, in a fascinating city.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Loved this boutique hotel!,"Recently returned from a girl's week trip to Marrakech. Loved this hotel. It was so charming. The food was the best we had in Marrakech. We did a cooking class which I would highly recommend. Unfortunately, I missed the spa but my friends who went said it was amazing. Service was excellent. Jose and owner was so nice and helpful!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Fantastic Honeymoon in a beautiful hotel,"We just got back from our honeymoon at La Maison Arabe. We took the Royal Suite, which is over 3 floors including private roof terrace and jacuzzi, and were just overwhelmed by the place and especially by the staff. From the bellboy to the manager, they could not do enough for us and they really made the holiday for us. For example, we were very bad at planning and woke up one morning feeling like a trip to the Ourika valley. We asked the manager at 10:45 if it was too late to organise an excursion that day and by 11:00 he had a people carrier and driver outside the front door waiting for us. The breakfasts were wonderful - weather permitting these are served by the pool and besides a wide range of buffet food, they will cook eggs for you any way you like. Be sure to…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 December 2013,5,A great hotel - and restaurant,"I celebrated a birthday at this historic and beautiful riad, Le Maison Arabe, by participating in their introductory cooking course followed by a dinner with friends. Regrettably we did not stay at this wonderful hotel this time - but hopefully during the next visit to Marrakech. The cooking course was top notch - very informative, entertaining and perfectly planned as well as executed. The cooking courses of Le Maison Arabe are highly recommendable. As to the dinner itself - the food was beyond wonderful and the settings were incredibly beautiful. Even though I did not stay at the hotel - I had to communicate with the staff on several occasions for planning etc. The level of service offered at this hotel is incredible, - possibly beyond anything you find elsewhere in Morocco.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2013,5,Splendor,"This is a beautiful place and like most of The Medina's best spots it's hidden away in a modest and relatively hard to find location. The modest exterior doesn't prepare you for the splendor and relaxed decadence inside. We didn't stay but visited for drinks on one night and I felt like I'd be transported into a different era. This is a pretty special experience for the senses and the ego - almost psychedelic if you understand my meaning. On another occasion we ate with friends and family... food in Marrakesh can be repetitive but is generally to my taste so I am more than happy about that. This was among the best examples of Moroccan food, particularly the platters to start with and the setting was really nice and colourful with live music (just right, not too intrusive). …",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Exceptional,"Just returned from an incredible first trip to Marrakech and 3 wonderful nights at La Maison Arabe. It's located inside the old city, a 10 minute walk from the large square. The hotel is larger than we were expecting and has 2 restaurants, a bar and large spa. Our room was immaculately clean and beautifully decorated, had a private terrace, and the wifi worked perfectly in the room and common areas of the hotel. Everyone on the staff is first class and made us immediately feel at home. A highlight for us was spending our last afternoon at the hotel's heavenly country property. They provide free transportation there. It was the most peaceful and relaxing way to unwind after two days of running around the city. The staff at the country property was also exceptional, we felt like…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,An amazing hotel,"My wife and I stayed at La Maison Arabe in Marrakech for three nights as part of an extensive trip around Morocco. We had already experienced some terrific Riads in Rabat, Fes and Ouarzazate but La Maison Arabe was easily the best accommodation we stayed in during our Moroccan trip. In fact, La Maison Arabe may be the best accommodation we have ever stayed in. Certainly nothing springs to mind that we would say was better. The level of individual service provided by the staff at La Maison Arabe has to be experienced to be believed. They even gave us a cellular phone with the number of the Riad already entered so that we could call if we ever had any problems while visiting the city. In addition to the service (which is really what sets this hotel apart from others) the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,First Class,This place is first class. The decor is charming with nice rooms filled with antiques and unique carpets. They also have a cooking school where we learned how to make a tagine. The staff is first class as well.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,A piece of quiet paradise in the middle of Marrakech,"We stayed at La Maison Arabe in the middle of November 2013. The hotel is tucked away down a quiet street about 20 minutes walk from the main square. It has a quiet unassuming entrance which leads into a beautiful interior of 6 raids beautifully decorated with a cool courtyard. Our room was tastefully decorated in typical Moroccan style. The hotel has two excellent restaurants ( one indoors specialising in Moroccan food and one outside for Moroccan and international food). There is also a villa outside of the city owned by the hotel which has an outdoor pool etc. this is 20 minutes away via free hotel taxi and when we were there, there were only 4 other people. It was like having your own villa. The staff at the hotel were very very polite and attentive. The main square and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,Loved our stay here,"La Maison Arabe is a very special place, and one of the best small hotels we have ever stayed in. It's located within walking distance of everything we wanted to see in Marrakesh: the old marketplace, the main square, the new city, and even the Jardin Majorelle. We were able to go to all by foot. The service at the hotel was flawless and personalized, friendly without being too much so, just perfect. Our room (called ""Noor""), although up quite a few stairs, was beautifully decorated, and had two private terraces; well worth the climb. We especially enjoyed the atmosphere at night, between the candlelit salons and patios, the musicians, the great ambiance in the piano bar, and dinner overlooking the pool. Magical! My husband and I were totally seduced by the city of Marrakesh.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 October 2013,5,Wonderful hotel,"I recently went to Marrakesh and stayed at La Maison Arabe. I somehow got booked in this beautiful suite. The room is well apponted with traditional Moroccan furnishing. The service at the hotel was amazing and they attended to your every whim with a smile.

The whole experience is fabulous from the moment we arrived we were treated so well by all the staff who all seemed to know our names and couldnt have been more helpful in ordering taxis', booking dinner reservations and a guide. We had dinner by the pool and the food was excellant. Breakfast is plentiful with a wide choice available. Our favourite place was the lounge which along with the adjoining courtyard is a great place to take afternoon complimentary tea. The decor is sumptous and so comfortable to relax after the craziness of the outside! Each night we had a drink in the jazz bar, another relaxing place to be especially when the fire is lit. The whole place is beautifully decorated, it felt very luxurious…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Absolute luxury,"It is quite simply the most delightful hotel I have ever stayed at, where attentiveness, service, food quality, cleanliness are all priority. You enter the hotel, are given a guided tour, offered a welcome drink, then shown to your suite. The decor is sumptuous, do you want to relax in the jazz bar, or maybe your own terrace, possibly the courtyard but you've the international restaurant, the Moroccan restaurant, the poolside or the hamman to chose from as well. Oh heck, don't forget to visit Marrakech, and if that feels like hard work they'll book the guide to get you around. The busiest most pleasant two day romantic trip where we didn't have to lift a finger. All trips have niggles- it rained !",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Simple Luxury in the heart of the Medina,"Where do I start? in a few words the BEST small hotel I have stayed at, in years. The decor, simply gorgeous and perfect, just perfect. Each single piece of furniture, every single doors, lights fixtures, simply tastefully decorated, warm, luxurious but never over the top The service is also a winner, the most accommodating i have experienced in years. My wife got sick and the next day, every single staff member came to see us to see how they could help even the General Manager. We asked for a last minute reservation at one of the most difficult restaurant in Marrakech, and they came through, as they knew it was important to us.

We were blown away from the moment we walked through the doors and our expectations were more than met throughout. From waking up to THE most incredible breakfast, to the warm friendly staff, and the unbelievable architecture there is something for everyone. We dined in the Morrocan Restaurant first night which was fabulous, and the last night we ate our own creation!! The cooking workshop was an absolute highlight - but Marrakech for us was simply amazing. Incredible sights, sounds, smells AND shopping - heaven!! We had a local guide which I would say was absolutely worth it.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,First class all round,"We stayed four nights, wish it were longer. All staff without exception were welcoming and helpful. The room was excellent, the food very good, and eating around the pool was delightful. The icing on the cake was the 'Country Club' about 20 minutes minibus transfer outside city- a beautiful tranquil garden, a large swimming pool, and more lovely food and excellent staff.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Paradise behind the walls,"Staff is very courteous and anxious to be of assistance. We planned on a grand dinner in the restaurant, we had heard so many rave reviews. Our schedule interfered and we only had time for appetizers. The staff accommodated us just the same with the friendly and humorous service. Food was first rate. Hechim, a bellhop from the lobby was particularly helpful in showing us how to make use of the Wifi and an app to call the U.S. free of charge.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Maison Arabe Cookery school,"I booked a half day course and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is obvious that they have huge experience in running cookery courses and the morning was really well planned. My class was 6 in total- I think maximum size 8. We started with an outline of what we would be doing and a demonstration of breakfast pancakes being made followed by a tasting.We then visited a nearby bakery to see the master baker taking delivery of loaves from locals and firing them. The course was led by the delightful and knowledgeable Wafaa with a Dada doing all the actual cooking . Our dish was a chicken and preserved lemon tagine to be served with two Moroccan salads. Each course member has a work station in the teaching kitchen with two gas rings, sink , choping board etc.; full and detailed oral and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,True Moroccan style,My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Maison Arabe at the start of our trip around Morocco and what a great start to the holiday it turned out to be! A truly authentic feel to the welcome and the room was large and quite unique. Superb food in one of the most beautiful restaurants we have had the pleasure to dine in. I can thoroughly recommend a stay here.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,Like a home not a hotel!!,"We stayed here for a luxury break for a few days and weren't dissapointed! You find it situated down a little alley and walk into this haven ! It's smells deliscious as you walk in and all the staff are very friendly , welcoming and not able to help enough !! I am gluten free and I found their advice and willingness to accommodate me very good - they made me corn bread every morning and even added cumin one day when they knew I had a poorly stomach! Hadn't realised that the country club was a short drive away , but this really didn't hamper things, there's a shuttle bus run by the hotel. The main thing I realised was the attention to detail throughout Would recommend and would return!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2013,5,First class Riad,"What a great Riad, big enough to be interesting, but small enough to still feel authentic. We loved our stay here. The staff were fantastic, the design of the hotel magical and the food excellent. We stayed in the Royal Suite which suited our family of three very well with the two separate levels and one bathroom on each level. Only minor gripe would be that the air-conditioning seemed incredibly noisy. We enjoyed our cooking class which was very well organised and included a visit to the hotels small shop outside the hotel and also a bakery where they bake everyone’s bread. There was a major power cut while we were there and the staff coped admirably for the 8 or so hours that the power was off. We all tried the spa which was good but being underground (where the spa is…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,Cooking class - Fine cuisine at La Maison Arabe,"I have just had not just the privilege, or the enjoyment, but the EXPERIENCE of attending the 1/2 day cooking class at La Maison Arabe. With 3 others, and under the exceptional guidance and instruction of Mafaa and the hotel's ""Dada"", I spent the morning making a chicken tagine, a hot salad and a cold salad. The result (for all of us) was mouthwateringly delicious and educational. I have not attended a cookery class before, but I do know that the bar is now set exceedingly high. The staff were professional and gracious. This was one of the best experiences of the week I had in Marrakech. (By the way, we took a tour of the hotel afterwards. I know where I'm staying the next time I visit!! )",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,An Oasis in the heart of the Medina,"I heard about La Maison Arabe several years ago from friends. Their comments were so overwhelmingly positive, they actually gushed, I didn't think everything they said could possibly - I was wrong. This small hotel is superlative in every way - the staff's hospitality, attention to detail and graciousness is peerless. . The restaurant served some of the best Moroccan food i had while in Marrakech and when I had had my film of tangines, I dined in the hotel's continental restaurant where I had an amazing dinner of baby lamb chops and possibly the best lemon tart I've ever had - that's a big complement coming from a New York foodie. The design and decor of the rooms and the common areas - the pool, the various bars, the rooms and suites - are filled with unique furnishings…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2013,5,"Back again and again, always something new.","we have stayed here on every trip to Marrakesh for over 13 years, sometimes twice in a year. Each time we leave we even more impressed with everything- the personnel are very welcoming, service exceptional especially the fast room service, and continuous upgrades of the rooms, restaurants, bar, and the heated pool. One unique feature to take advantage of is the private gardens, pool, and restaurant that can be visited by a 15 minute free shuttle service. If you have time, a lunch around the garden pool is an experience to behold. The cooking school is located there and is worth taking a class or two if you have time. The Maison Arabe is not the Mamounia, one the same top level, but different in many ways- smaller, more exclusive, less ostentatious, and quietly hidden in the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,4,"A seasoned, refined riad in Marrakech","We happily spent two nights in the Nahar royal suite, as well as enjoyed the riad's spa, piano bar and two restaurants during our stay. Having pioneered the riad hotel concept in Marrakech, La Maison Arabe's experience is evident in its gracious service. All the staff were unfailingly courteous and eager to please; Morad at the front desk deserves a special mention for his warm welcome to the property and the city as well as ensuring our comfort throughout our stay. It has been several years since the last renovation, but all in all the property is kept up well. When we arrived, there were some minor adjustments needed in our suite (i.e. the remote control for the air conditioner, a locked safe and a burned out light bulb in a closet), which were taken care of right away. …",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 October 2013,5,Splendid old Riad in the Medina,"Have just retuned from Marrakech, where we spent three nights at La Maison Arabe. Very hard to find any fault. We were looked after very well from the first moment we entered the front door. We had a garden suite which was sizeable and very comfortable (aircon a little noisy). Very interesting hotel layout and beautifully furnished. Had one meal in the hotel which turned out to be the best we had. Also central location very interesting. Lovely swimming pool a 20 min shuttle ride away.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,Attention to detail,"La Maison Arabe What can I say that hasn’t already been said? From the moment we stepped off the lane in the medina, just 10 minutes from the main square, and were greeted by the charming manager who took us to a small courtyard for a refreshing mixed fruit drink (lime, orange, banana, mint) served with nuts while our paper work was processed and our room made ready, until the time we left, 4 days later, you could not fault the attention to detail. Our huge room overlooked the courtyard pool. Because this has been built in two stages and actually straddles two streets, it takes a little time to find your way around – but all is explained when you are given a tour of the place, including the wellness centre with its hamam. There is plenty to see in Marrakech but do spend some…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,Fantastic riad in Marrakech- incredible staff and food!,"We spent four nights of our honeymoon in this fantastic riad. From the beginning of our exchanges with staff- Nabila- we were thoroughly impressed! Upon arrival, every single person we interacted with was so helpful, kind, patient and knowledgable. The location was ideal for exploring the medina and Marrakech more broadly. The rooms were beautiful (fabulous beds) and incredibly well organized in terms of ensuring privacy etc. The restaurant food was amazing and the breakfasts each morning fantastic. No task was too big or too complicated for our wonderful La Maison Arabe staff- I fell ill and we had to change our reservation and they were so accommodating. Could not recommend this place highly enough-- guarantee you will have a wonderful stay! An incredibly memorable honeymoon…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2013,5,Peace and grace in the midst of chaos,"Marrakech is wonderful, exciting, exotic city, but it is busy and chaotic. La Maison Arabe is an oasis of calm and elegance in the midst of the chaos. The hotel is located down an alley off a main street near the Djemma-el-Fna. It is an interesting structure, architecturally; it is actually fun to try to find one's way around. The hospitality of the staff, including a great bartender and an amazing group at the front desk, is absolutely first class. The rooms are magnificent, combining Moroccan art and sensibility with modern features. The restaurant is elegant with great food and service and amazing ambiance, overlooking a beautiful pool. One plus: when there was some confusion about the class of room we booked (and prepaid), the management upgraded us to a room above…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2013,5,Nice place to relax,"This hotel has great staff, the reception staff were very welcoming. We had the Moroccan dinner the first night we were there, and it had a great selection of beautiful food. We had the degustation Moroccan menu and make sure you are hungry because there is lots of food. I would have liked to do the cookery school but ran out of time, it looked like a lot of fun. The Hamman was very busy also so make sure you book early.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Maison did....and more. My room was wonderful. The only exception was-no clock. But that can be worked around. Loved the location. The staff were all very friendly, patient and helpful.

 July 2013,5,haven of peace in bustling Marrakech,"it was our first trip to Morocco and we found it was a bit daunting to be harrassed in the street whenever we left the hotel, but La Maison Arabe was beautifully peaceful and the service from all the staff we came across was exceptional. We also visited the country club outside the town where the service was fabulous.Also the spa was first class.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2012,5,Exotic Dream Come True in the Sinbad Suite,"An exotic oriental dream come true, the riad has several courtyards where one can loll about in a food or wine induced stupor while enjoying a cool breeze at night. The spa is just beautiful. There is also a country club with an even bigger swimming pool that is right outside of the city and accessible by free shuttle from the hotel. We were treated to a Morroquito, the alcoholic version of the Moroccan mint tea (is basically a slightly exotic mojito).",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,Beautiful,Lovely hotel with beautiful Moroccan features and design. Large spacious rooms. The food was nice in the evening but breakfast was limited. The staff were all very friendly.

 May 2013,5,The best place from over 150 we have ever stayed in,"My wife and I consider ourselves pretty seasoned travelers having been to about 50 countries and stayed in over 150 commercial accommodations from mega luxury to modest and from one night to weeks in the last decade or so. After the grueling and tediously boring 8+ hours train trip from Fes, we arrived in Marrakech and were met by a pleasant English speaking guide exactly as booked with La Maison Arabe. We were taken a short drive in a modern aircon'd Mercedes van to the hotel and escorted into the lobby where we were pleasantly greeted by a number of staff. A lovely gesture was moist scented cool face-washer/towelettes to dab of the dust and grime of the journey. From that moment on throughout our stay, every member of the staff was overtly concerned for our comfort and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2013,4,Take time to enjoy the hotel,"Maison Arabe is an old riad with thick terracotta walls, spacious rooms over looking the central pool come dining area. The service is pleasant and unobtrusive with a relaxed and congenial atmosphere. Take time to enjoy the surroundings and calm before heading to the Medina and souks which are an easy walk away, but most of all, enjoy the food. There are international dishes, but you would be mad not to try the delicious local dishes, spectacular Morroccan wines and all the sweet treats you can manage. The hotel is old, full of character and because of this, you forgive the slightly worn furnishings and occasional bit of bad plumbing, although for the price, maybe not. Get the hotel to organise you a pick up from the airport. It is worth the small extra price and makes it…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

If you are looking for a true Moroccan experience within a luxury setting then this is the place to be. The staff are at your service with a smile at all times, happy to make bookings and arrange trips at your requests.

 September 2013,5,A memorable holiday,"Had a throughly enjoyable time at this riad/boutique hotel. Yes, the rooms were beautifully appointed, clean, and the beds very comfortable. Yes, the location was central and we could walk to the souks and the square, but it is the staff that wins you over above all else. Ahmed gave us a wonderful half day guided tour of Morocco, We definitely needed this and learnt so much about Morocco, its people and its history. We couldn't have navigated the souks without him. Mr Adil Chaif and other staff at the concierge desk were very professional and helpful. Badr, the manager of the restaurant arranged a beautiful surprise birthday cake for my friends birthday along with restaurant staff singing traditional berber music to her. It was done beautifully without a hint of cheesiness!…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2013,5,Amazing- even in August,"A beautiful riad in the centre of Marrakech with attentive and charming staff and mmmmarvelous food. La piece de la resistance has to be the spa, I could while away more than a few days in there without surfacing for air. The accompanying country club is a short drive away and is a lovely bit of respite from the busy Marrakech streets. The heat was a factor in August, I won't lie, and not all of the riad is air conditioned but the rooms, reception and dining room are so it's not a problem. I would definitely, without hesitation, recommend the riad.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The hotel is an oasis to the outside hustle of Marrakesh. The long breakfasts were delightful sitting by the pool and the restaurant was very elegant.

Passing a few days through Marrakech, Ouarzazate and then the Sahara, the last leg of our trip was in Agadir. Apart from Royal Air Maroc, everything on this trip until Agadir was beyond perfection, in every way. Le Riad (Hotel) Maison Arabe is sheer perfection. Rooms, service, meals, and everything in between is simply on the spot. We could not have hoped for a better first immersion into the Moroccan lifestyle than this hotel.

Traditional furniture, lots of little windows (plus big ones) and a large patio overlooking the pool. Then returned for three nights to room 244, which is in the more modern part. Bright, well furnished and the most storage I have experienced in any hotel. Two full runs of wardrobe hanging plus 33 (I counted) drawers and shelves. A big lovely, relaxing room with large double windows looking onto the pool and across to the mosque. Extraordinary hospitality and service from all the staff.

 March 2013,5,Luxury when it was needed most,"After a year of work in Tanzania under often stressful circumstances we took a time out at Maison Arabe and did not regret a minute. A power outage totally out of the control of the hotel resulted in a beautiful complimentary bottle of champagne and much solicitous attention. The food was unbelievable and the atmosphere breathtaking. The most impressive thing though had to be the staff who were the perfect combination of attentive yet unobtrusive...not always the case in Morocco where the service can sometimes be too much ""in your face""",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The decor of the hotel is totally Moroccan and the food is great. Cooking lessons and the spa (hammam) are not to be missed.

My son was sick (traveler's tummy problems) during one of the days and the staff could not have been more caring and helpful: sending special food and drink, checking in, helping clean up, etc. We also took advantage of the beautiful spa (hammam and massage) and cooking class while we were there (so much fun for the entire family).

I was on business in Casablanca and a friend recommended that I visit La Maison Arabe and I am so glad that I did. The staff are very kind and accommodating. The hotel is so interesting and beautiful - there were many different places to explore within the hotel and you never felt like there were many other people around. I have stayed in other hotels in Morocco and none of them hold up to the standards of this place. My bed was really comfortable and loved my room. I had a terrace and had breakfast on the terrace a couple of the mornings of my stay, which was really great. I also had a couple of treatments at the spa - which were excellent.

We loved our room – we had one overlooking the pool. The food was incredible and the breakfast was out of this world. We really enjoyed the Moroccan restaurant – what an experience. We had a beef and lamb tagines – they were both really delicious. We loved the music as well. The restaurant is beautifully decorated in traditional moroccan style. The spa treatments were amazing – best massage we have ever had and the spa staff are outstanding. The best kept secret is the country club location – which is a another location about 15 mins from the hotel via a shuttle – with beautiful gardens and a huge pool. It was such a tranquil place. We chose this hotel…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Super Comfort and Great Service,"I am so very happy that we found La Maison Arabe. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The Riad itself is well situated, extremely clean, and well cared for. What set this place apart however was the incredibly supportive staff. They responded to each and every request we had and always with a smile. When we were ripped off a little while shopping they even interceded with the shop keeper to get our money back! The food in the restaurants and bar was terrific and of course the service was great as well. When you go there be sure to go to the Moroccan cooking class - it's truly world class as well.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2013,4,Very good hotel rather than a Riad,"I agree with the other reviews though having stayed in a beautiful riad in Essaouira (Riad Chbanate) La Maison Arabe felt much more like a hotel than a Riad. The service was excellent, the Jazz bar is a beautiful space as are many of the small lounges and courtyard spaces. The rooms (in the modern part of the hotel) were good though lacked some Moroccan charm or feel for me. The rooms in the original part of the hotel might be better.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

We decided to go for dinner as our friend had said it was the best place they went to during their stay in Morocco. We didn't make a reservation, but we got there well before the restaurant opened for the evening. We went to the bar and had drinks while we waited. The decor was just absolutely stunning! The staff were super friendly and extremely efficient. With our drinks they served us a variety of little nibbles such as nuts, olives and peppers, which was such a nice touch.

Marrakech was certainly that, but despite heat in the 40's and Ramadam it was well worth it. You have to be careful, but we didn't find intimidating, ate In the square, bartered and loved the vibrant activity. In the middle of this La Maison was a wonderful oasis of calm. The rooms luxurious, the staff great and breakfast in the courtyard by the pool wonderfully calming. Being in the Medina made us feel even more absorbed. The hotel also has a Kasbah/country club that you reach by shuttle bus. After a half day walking the souks this was fantastic. The hotel also recommended great restaurants.

 September 2012,5,Great hotel experience,When we arrived we didn't know what to expect but were quickly reassured that this was going to be a great experience the minute we stepped into the hotel. We were wowed by the stunning decor and the really friendly and inviting staff. Having stayed for over a week we enjoyed everyday of our family holiday as this hotel helped us plan our excersions so that we had the best possible experience.

A few steps out of the hotel is the hustle and bustle of the town, then return for a blissful mint tea and tranquillity of La Maison Arabe. The staff and management have got the perfect balance between outstanding service, and leaving you alone to de-stress. They are all just like family. I am a vegetarian, with special dietary needs. Many places I go to I struggle with food, but the crew here just got it, and went out of the way to serve me outstanding healthy and refreshing food. The restaurant is a MUST. Over all probably the best hotel and service mix I have ever experienced, the perfect little get away to unwind, and relax",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2013,5,Cookery School,"Can't comment on staying here but my family and I came here for the cooking school and it was brilliant. We were given information about Moroccan cuisine, sampled traditional breakfast dishes, went to see the local bakery, the hotel shop with its spices and cooked too. Dessert was made for us, all served up by the great staff there. The two ladies delivering the school were brilliant and even showed us the hotels spa which we have signed up for. The recipes cooked were great and we thoroughly enjoyed what we cooked.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Amazing....,"We stayed here in July 2013, from recommendation by my cousin. The staff were very courteous and went the extra mile to ensure we were happy.

One of the most enjoyable aspects was coming down for breakfast, the service was brilliant and the food was delicious, the other enjoyable aspect was sitting in the courtyard drinking afternoon tea, listening to the trickle of water and sipping mint tea.... it was truly a paradise.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,La Maison Arabe,"Stayed here in July 2013 with my Mother. The staff were super helpful and friendly. Being NZ'ers and a little short on Arabic or French language skills the staff had a good knowledge of English which was really appreciated by us! The hotel is just gorgeous, boutique-ish and tastifully done. Location is good - and easy to find which isn't always the case with some hotels/Riads in Morocco if they are in the old part of the cities and down a series of narrow alleyways. Not the case with La Maison Arabe. About a 50 metre walk (if that) from where the taxi dropped us off. Would highly recommend the Moroccan cooking class that the hotel runs - we had so much fun and it was a lovely experience. Would also highly recommend the Spa - it has a wonderful atmosphere - really…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,A true oasis,"This summer we spent time with the entire family in Morocco and felt very lucky to have found La Maison Arabe as our hub. The hotel went the extra mile with their excellent service already before our arrival: the very friendly staff helped us plan our entire trip trough Morocco, find the best places to stay and visit plus arranged for all guides and drivers throughout the country. Even though we visited Morocco during the period of Ramadan when Moroccans fasten all day long and sleep very little, their staff was always very attentive. Despite being a small hotel, La Maison Arabe is a high quality full service hotel in romantic setting, with two very good restaurants, a small pool in the Medina and a larger one at their own country club which was ideal place for our children to…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Beautiful hotel in the centre of the medina,"La Maison Arabe exceeded our expectations, from the attentive staff, rooms, decor and ambience. A few minutes walk from from the main square and souks. Great breakfast selection. The country club is an ideal retreat from a busy and hot Marrakesh.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,4,Great stay - don't recognize a lot of those photos though,"We were completely with our stay. The staff were very helpful, the hotel has lots of nooks and cranny's to explore, location is close to the Souks. I don't recognize a lot of these photos though - possibly the only one I recognize is the pool lit in the evening. The other pool shown may be the one that's their garden - a bus ride away courtesy of the hotel. Only thing we would improve is slightly more variety on the lunchtime menu, and possibly breakfast. But otherwise this really was a very pleasant stay with very helpful staff that didn't feel like they were trying to rip you off like everyone else in Marakesh.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Beautiful hotel that treats you like family!,"Last week I stayed in La Maison Arabe with my daughter for three nights. It was absolutely wonderful. All the employees make you feel like you are part of their family. They made sure we were comfortable in the hotel as well as out of the hotel. They arranged tour guides, drivers and walking escorts for us. All were done at a very fair price. The pool at the hotel is very nice and tranquil, the restaurant is delicious, the cooking school was wonderful and the off site pool was well worth the 15 minute shuttle there. The location of the hotel is very convenient for touring as well as walking to restaurants. The rooms are beautiful and the house keeping is impeccable. We would definitely recommend La Maison Arabe to friends and family",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Beautiful Hotel,"We had a five-night stay at La Maison Arabe in July. After coming off safari it was the perfect play to relax. The hotel is gorgeous and has many beautiful architectural details and places which are peaceful and relaxing. The staff was always very accommodating and provided us with excellent service. We didn't realize how aggressive the local merchants are. Make sure you hire a local guide to avoid the constant hustle. Our hotel provided one and it made our daily trips out in the city much easier. If you want a break from shopping, utilize their country club. We did on our last day and really enjoyed the pool and gardens.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Wonderful,"We had been visiting Spain and made a short 3 night excursion to Marrakech. The hotel provided transport to and from the Hotel at a very reasonable cost. The location is perfectly situated close to the square and souks. The pool on site is pleasant and makes for a relaxing afternoon break. The 15 minute trip (free) to the 'country club' was an ideal getaway from the medina with a large pool, nice outdoor lunch and quite environment. We found the staff pleasant and helpful. They went out of their way to help us when ever we asked and they welcomed our kids with humour and warmth. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We would recommend this hotel to friends and family in a flash.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Absolutely Perfect!,"This hotel is perfect; the location is in the old medina, close to the souk and within walkable distance of most sights. The riad itself is historic and very beautiful, very moroccan with stunning decor and the rooms are five-star - and everything is spotlessly clean. The rooms are also air-conditioned. The food is delicious. There is a beautiful pool in the hotel but there is also the country-club pool owed by the hotel located outside the medina - a complimentary shuttle runs between the riad and the pool. All the staff (without exception) are superb, so helpful, friendly and courteous. Nothing is too much trouble. Marod and Mrs Nabila will personally ensure your stay exceeds your expectations. I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Great Experience at La Maison,"We just returned from Marrakech where we stayed at La Maison Arabe for 4 nights. La Maison is a converted riad with a ton of character, enhanced by excellent customer service. It's conveniently located to Jemaa el Fne and the souks. The restaurant at the hotel is top notch, and the bar at the hotel was outstanding(although I wished they carried a bigger variety of beers). During our stay, there was a scheduling mixup concerning a cooking class that we had signed up for. No worries-Adil, the GM, made it right by rescheduling a private lesson for my wife the following day. Not easy during Ramadan. My wife raved about the Hamman at La Maison. While in Marrakech, I took a walk-through and had a drink at one of the other large, top hotels in Marrakesh. I found it to be…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,A Memorable Moroccan Experience,"I had the pleasure of staying at La Maison Arabe on my very first and recent trip to Marrakech. This wonderful hotel is a converted riad, the very first of it's kind in the Medina, and is in a terrific location. The decor is pure Moroccan and you feel the connection to the magical city of Marrakech throughout the public spaces as well as the rooms. The food at the restaurant is fantastic... from the fresh vegetable juices and homemade yogurt at breakfast, to the exquisite chicken and preserved lemon tagine at dinner. But what really sets this hotel apart, and I believe what made this trip such a memorable experience for me is the entire hotel staff. The very gracious and accommodating hotel managers Taoufik and Nabila were ever present, but very low key and just kept the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Charming Riad enhanced by excellent customer service,"Everyone says how good this hotel is - and they're right. Both the team who run it and those who work there are simply exceptional. Superb customer service from the moment you arrive to the minute you depart. There is nothing that is too much trouble - even on your last day and you're waiting for the airport transfer, they look after your every need and make sure you don't want for anything during that time. We were offered a guest room in which to shower and change before leaving and they had completed our emigration forms too - quite unexpected. We had a beautiful first floor suite overlooking the pool - pretty, spacious and cool - it was a haven from the heat. They will organise tours, get a driver and a car at the drop of a hat and are always on hand to offer advice…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Great Riad,My family and I just spent a wonderful 3 nights at this great Riad with a perfect location in the Medina of Marrakesh. Reception staff very friendly and ready to assist with anything. Enjoyed the 2 level royal suite which felt like being in a private home Only downside - the breakfast a little poor Absolutely loved the Cooking class run by the excellent school manager and her assistants This is a great city and this the perfect accommodation to make you feel lie you are truly in Morocco !,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,Charming and traditional,"This riad-hotel is supposed to be the first riad in Marrakech. The structure and architechture are traditional and typical of Marrakech, with a lot of woodwork, tiles and courtyards. In the rooms, all the doors are covered with leather, ours had a little balcony-terrace. The staff was very friendly and attentive, always ready to help with any request or question. They suggested restaurants, atracctions, escorted us to nearby restaurants, provided transportation from Fes, and to the airport. We had dinner at their restaurant the first night, it was very good and served in the lovely courtyard with live music and beautiful moroccan lighting. Breakfast was served in the same courtyard with the pool in the center, it was a buffet with traditional western and also moroccan items.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 July 2013,5,Just wonderful,"This hotel is just lovely, everything about it was just to our taste, the food home made the room was luxurious. We found the hotel easy to find just get on the bus no 19 and ask the driver and he will drop you off about 5-7min walk from the hotel. They also have a shop on the street which the lady was very helpful and called the hotel for someone to take our luggage. The staff very helpful anything you need. There is a Country Club what a fabulous place, the shuttle takes you there for free and bring you back, food and drinks are available there.Taxi from hotel should be about 20dhs to the square,always agree a price before you take the taxi. Forgot about the spa you must try the Hammam it an experience, we just went to see and asked on the day we arrived if we could book…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,A lovely hotel,"We were staying at this hotel as part of a package which included a couple days with a driver and guide visiting the sites of Marrakech including the medina, kasbah, souks, Atlas mountains and a berber family's home. We were really delighted by everything at La Maison Arabe. The staff were lovely and very helpful. When we entered our room there were rose petals everywhere and our room was attached to a very pleasant courtyard. The highlights for us however were the evenings. We first went each evening to the Jazz Bar, which is beautifully decorated, before dining outside the around the pool. This is a very romantic spot lit entirely with candles and beautiful Moroccon lights. The food and service was absolutely first class to the point where this was the only place that …",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,Great restaurant experience,"Made a reservation for Saturday evening while being in Marrakech with my wife and were pleasantly surprised to find a quiet and peaceful restaurant (at the pool) in the middle of noise Marrakech. Meals were very good and the service exceptional. We were also surprised by a very good Morrocan white wine, a Chardonnay from the Atlas region.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,a Special Place,"La Maison Arabe was a bit difficult to find, but worth the search. Our room was up many stairs, but hade two private patiios, a sitting roo as well as a large bedroom. Furnishes were beautiful. Breakfast was excellent and staff extrememly helpfull. The hotel is in walking distance of many imprtant sites. Therre is a large swimmimg pool wit courtesy service about 15 minutes from the hotel. Meal were all superior and lunch is available at the pool.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,The Romance Continues.....,"I see that there are over 600 excellent reviews. What could I possibly have to add? But I feel compelled to write something because I love this place so much. It is the perfect melding of riad and hotel. Most riads are very small and don't have hotel services such as front desk, 24-hour concierge, laundry, A/C, TV, Pool(s) spa, housekeeping, etc. As far as I know there are only seven full riad/hotels in Marrakech and La Maison Arabe is perfection. I was first there for a ""milestone"" birthday celebration, with 25 friends, in 2011. The way the staff handled that situation was the equal of any great 7-star large hotel. But this time, I was by myself and was there for almost a month. The staff was flawless and the experience was supremely professional and yet, friendly and…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Perfect Marrakech Riad,"La Maison Arabe is tucked away down a side street, about a 10 minute walk from the Medina. The decor throughout is traditional and in keeping with the stunning building. It has a lovely bar, 2 great restaurants and the nicest staff you could wish to meet. We stayed for 2 nights and didn;t want to leave. The added bonus is the country club about 15 minutes away (free shuttle) where there are beautiful gardens, a great pool and lunch restaurant.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,A dream in Marrakesh!,"One of the best hotels I have ever been to! Stepping inside from the busy and narrow streets of the medina you immediately feel the peace and quiet one needs to recover after an exciting day in Marrakesh. The place is an oasis of style and luxury, excellent staff, excellent food, the whole interior is decorated with so much taste and love of detail that you would have to stay for at least 1001 nights to discover all the beautiful things that surround you. I will definitely come back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Excellent hotel,"Cannot fault this hotel - location, atmosphere, service, rooms, food etc. just excellent. A slight problem that we had experienced ( noticed after we returned home ), was handled with alacrity and style by the manager, and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere with an ' authentic ' feel and near the heart of the city. Fully deserves the high ranking.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,Excellent service and facilities,"this plase is one of these places where you stay to experience magic. It is beautifully decorated, the rooms are amazing, the whole atmosphere is about elegance and beauty. The restaurant is awesome and dont miss the ""milk pastilla"" for dessert! my favorite! At dinner time, there are multiple musicians playing, alternating between soft traditional moroccan music and luth. If you want romance, that's the place to go as the tables are placed around a small swimming pool surrounded by moroccan lanterns.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,Wonderful place to stay,"Having just returned from La Maison Arabe we have nothing but positive things to say about this lovely place. We really couldn't have chosen anywhere better for our stay in Marrakech. The staff and service were first class, attentive without being over the top. We ate here two nights and on the third night chose to eat out at another 'top' restaurant in the Medina. We sincerely wished that we had eaten here a third night instead! Badr the guy in charge of the restaurant and its staff was extremely friendly and helpful in suggesting places to go. It really was one of the best small hotels that we have ever stayed in - anywhere in the World. The swimming pool at The Country Club is a good size and again, staff are attentive and the food there was lovely too. It was an…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 June 2013,5,The perfect Riad,This was our first trip to Marrakech and I am so happy we chose to stay at the Maison Arabe. I cannot imagine a better riad and here is why; the hotel is within walking distance to the souks and offers a wonderful base for exploring. They were really helpful and were happy to arrange guides and cars for us. They even provided us with a mobile phone to call them in case we got lost in the souks and needed collecting! If you needed a break from the madness you could either relax in the courtyard or make use of the country club which is available to all guests. The hotel arrange the shuttle and you are then only 15 minutes away from a stunning pool and garden. We ate and ate and ate during our stay simply because everything tasted so good. But what makes it stand out is the care…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2013,5,More than full service,"We spent 5 days at the Maison Arabe in Marrakech. The room, the atmosphere, the entertainment, the personal and helpful service and the location including the facilities were all fantastic!!! The hotel consists of 6 old riads (=houses of former times with a little courtyard in the middle where people relaxed from the heat and desert outside) which are adapted very nicely in the Marrocan style. We stayed in the Aladdin Suite which is situated in the old part of the hotel with a nice little terrace overlooking the pool area. We can only recommend this room. The wellness area is in the cellar of the lately built part (although this is also adapted to the Marrocan style of a riad) and we really enjoyed a hammam treatment with massage afterwards. There are two restaurants, one…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,So Good They Make it Difficult to Try New Marrakech Riads,"This was our third stay at Maison Arabe. We like to change hotels when visiting the same cities but this place makes it difficult: there's something perfect about it -- and we tend to be quite critical. First, the public rooms: they are exquisite. The library is a dream, the sitting area in the courtyard is beautiful, and the bar is one of the most elegant I've ever seen. The owner has impeccable taste and the antiques, paintings, millwork and seating reflect it. We've been in 5 different rooms in our multiple visits and my daughter, visiting with us, was in two - a fair sampling. Each is unique, beautifully decorated and comfortable. Though the bathrooms can be on the small side, they are very well designed and also beautifully decorated. Most of the rooms we've had come with…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Beautiful Riad in a quiet and calm spot yet close to Djemaa el Fna,"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a tour, then we had another riad booked for our last 4 nights in Marrakesh. Wish we had stayed at La Maison Arabe for our whole stay in Marrakesh! This place is beautiful. It is very traditional but so comfortable. It is down a small lane way and this made for the quiet atmosphere but was convenient to everything. We had dinner in both of the restaurant but we liked the Moroccain best. The courtyard is a lovely spot to have a drink before dinner but there are lots of little spots to either have a drink or just sit and read. Breakfast was good and we had the Moroccan pancakes one morning - delicious. I would love to stay here again if I go to Marrakesh",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Absolutely superb!,"My grown daughters and I stayed at La Maison Arabe in late May and it was certainly one of the top hotel experiences I've ever had. It was excellent from start to finish. The room was lovely. The food was very good, especially at their premier restaurant. Breakfast or lunch in their outdoor courtyard by the small pool was a delight. The décor and details throughout the hotel were beautifully done. The larger pool is a 20 minute shuttle ride away, but is well appointed and a serene oasis in its own right. We took the cooking class the hotel offered and that too was fun and led by a very gracious and knowledgeable host. Most notable perhaps was how personable and helpful the staff was, particularly those at the front desk. (Thank you again, Adil Chaif.) This is truly a 5 Star…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Perfection,"We just returned from a stay at La Maison Arabe and highly recommend it. Everything was perfect. From the beautiful decor and architecture, the friendly and attentive staff, the wonderful food, the incredible bath products, the inventive cocktail of the day in the wonderful jazz bar, the afternoon tea with the amazing cookies and pastries and buffet breakfast on the pool patio, to the great location, we couldn't have been happier. An exceptional riad...we loved our stay. Thank you to everyone who made our visit so special.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,A lovely place in Marrakesh,"LA Maison Arabe was everything that was expected, and more. It was lovely to have breakfast on the balcony, with the Moroccan sun shining down, You cannot go wrong. Highly recommended. There is a cooking class where you can learn how to prepare food in a tajine.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Charming Riad and secret garden,We spent 5 nights at La maison Arabe with our 5 year old son. This is a sophisticated Riad with different atmospheres. A secret garden with a large swiming pool is located outside the Medina: this is very relaxing for parents like us with a child after few hours spent in the souks... The staff is also charming and welcome you very well.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Beautiful Riad. First class service,"My friend and I turned 40 this year and wanted to celebrate with a special holiday. We were recommended to La Maison Arabe by an experienced traveller and I am pleased to say it did not disappoint. Hidden away down a little alley this secret paradise is a perfect place to relax and unwind after experiencing the excitement and hubub of Marrakesh. Preferring small and more personal to larger hotels, this Riad illustrates this perfectly. The staff are simply wonderful, nothing is too much trouble and everything is done with a smile. We were lucky enough to stay for 6 nights and enjoyed most aspects of the hotel - The Hammam and spa are pure indulgence, one of the best treatments I have ever had. If you have time make sure you book yourself onto the half day cookery course where you…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Wonderful hotel,"This is a wonderful small hotel that has charm and intimacy. The staff goes out of its way to serve you, and you are made to feel welcome as soon as you step into the premises. We stayed in the older part of the hotel, which is quiet and has quirks such as little alcoves and unexpected steps. We very much enjoyed the individuality of the rooms, although I would say that for those who do not like stairs, this section of the hotel is not for you. The newer section has an elevator, and does go to the breakfast room much more directly. Although we stayed in the older section, the bathrooms are very new and it appears that everything was renovated recently.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Special place,"We just returned from our 3 days vacation at La maison arabe we just loved it.

 May 2013,5,Paradise on Earth,"We, four adults, spent four nights here in Mai 2013. The reception on our arrival was exceptional. Mr Adil, the Manager showed us round the whole place, which is composed of five adjoining Riads. The Riads are tastefully decorated and equipped in traditional moroccan style, with a Hammam and Spa, which one of our Party used every day and said she'd never had better Treatment. The rooms are soundproofed and mainly overlook the pool which is surrounded by the courtyard Restaurant. A comprehensive Breakfast was enjoyed by all and Snacks could be had all day long. In the evenings, there is a choice between the traditional Morrocan Restaurant, where I expressly recommend the Taster Meal, introducing many morroccan dishes ( arrive with a BIG Appetite)! Meals may also be taken at the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,4,Family Visit,7 members of my family stayed at La Maison Arabe and we loved it. After a long series of flights from the states we started with a Hamam. Wow!

And for a treat just hop on the shuttle to their private country club.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Outstanding service,"Although I wasn`t fortunate enough to be a hotel guest and fully immerse myself in the sublime surroundings, I did have the pleasure of joining one of the well established cooking workshops. The cooking workshop lasts 5 hours and takes place in a purpose built kitchen overlooking the courtyard and pool - a most wonderful setting. The equipment and chefs were top drawer. The workshop has a very good reputation and I can see why. There is an opportunity to visit a local bakery, cook a tagine and other local delicacies. I did manage make the rather elementary mistake of cutting myself rather badly, but was chauffeur driven to the nearest private hospital and fastracked to be seen within 10 minutes. Even the bill was picked up all courtesy of the General Manager Taoufik…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,Seems like a dream,"We stayed Le Maison Arabe for four magical days at the start of May. Marrakech is a wonderful country for exploring and excitement, Le Maison Arabe however added the luxury element and provided a true haven from the busy streets. Our stay was for our wedding anniversary and we are so glad we decided to stay here. The facilities are excellent, the rooms are gorgeous, the restraunt and food are amazing and the staff are first class. Nothing is too much trouble and you feel incredibly welcome from the time you arrive to the point of leaving. The only problem is having to leave, now it just seems like a dream. Looking forward to going back soon.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2013,5,Beautiful hotel with impeccable service,"I recently went to Marrakesh and stayed at La Maison Arabe. I somehow got booked in this beautiful suite. The room is well apponted with traditional Moroccan furnishing. The service at the hotel was amazing and they attended to your every whim with a smile. For example, I informed that I was heading out to the souk on my own (as a single woman) and without prompting they provided me with a local cell phone to insure that if I needed help I could easily reach the hotel and have someone come get me. I also had a massage at the hotel and took a cooking class. All the services were amazing. I boarded my flight home completely relaxed and now I know how to prepare a chicken tagine (having learned from one of the best)!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2013,5,"Beautiful Riad, a warm welcome in the heart of the medina","We have just returned from a 5 night stay in this really lovely Riad. We stayed in a patio side suite (room 216) which had a delightful private patio overlooking the pool. The room was lovely, spacious and very well equipped, (it was up two flights of fairly steep stairs which may be a problem for some) There was a very spacious bathroom. Housekeeping was exceptional and the whole house was spotless, attention to the smallest detail was evident. There is a lovely pool (guide books and websites say there isn't one - I believe it was added recently) and a lovely shady sun deck for when the medina is a little too much! We were made very welcome when we arrived and were shown around the house, it is a bit of a warren as it is several houses made into one, so there are little stair…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The Country Club is a ""oasis"" of such perfection,set in lovely gardens, again wonderful staff, fab food, amazing facilities, it is hard to believe you are still in Marrakech. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay Marrakech was just incredible, buzzing, colourful and we were at ease walking and exploring on our own, though we did have a guide for a few hours to take us into the Souks and some of the architectural gems.

 May 2013,5,Wish there were 6 stars: Simply without fault,"We chose La Maison Arabe as it looked really authentic. The other reviews all sang praises and as one who writes good and bad reviews this ticked the boxes. None of the other reviews say anywhere what this should say. I have travelled the world in 5star hotels but have never seen the level of attention we are getting here. Yes I write this from Hillel suite overlooking the pool as we go into our 4th and final night. On arrival I knew you walked up an unassuming alley to a Riad made of many houses. But when you step inside, this place has blown me away. My bags were taken, no silly ticket, a tour of the property and a fantastic drink delivered with love from the barman, the bags a moment later. The room is exquisite, we are not in the largest suite or even have a balcony,…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,The perfect way to celebrate a birthday,"Neither of us had been to Marrakech before, and I'm so glad that we chose La Maison Arabe as the setting for my birthday treat. The hotel is a beautiful, relaxing oasis in the middle of a hot, exciting and bustling city, and it is a pleasure to arrive there, and be greeted by courteous, smiling staff. As soon as the wonderful staff found out about my birthday they went out of their way to make our stay very special.

Thank you so much - we will return!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,I Really liked La Maison Arabe,"I wasn't feeling well at all. Thepeople at Maison Arabe were so kind, friendly, and interested in my welfare, which seemed quite sincere.

We stay in hotels all over the world for our jobs and I am yet still to find anywhere that compares with the exceptional customer service and caring staff at this hotel. The reception staff are incredibly helpful and very knowledgeable about what to do and where to go.

 March 2013,5,Like the song says...,"You're too marvelous for words! Everything about this hotel is marvelous. The decor - spectacular and so refined; the food - delicious; the service - warm and courteous; the rooms - comfortable and clean; the location - just easy to find but not in the thick of the swarming action. I loved every minute of my stay in Marrakesh, and so much of it was due to my lovely stay at La Maison Arabe. Thank you everyone!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Excellent service and location,"The Riads that make up the hotel are all very attractive, facilities equal to a modern hotel, but delivered with rare style. Service excellent and staff very helpful, cookery course fun. Location excellent to walk out to the souks and restaurants, we really liked Marrakech and were not too bothered by the attentions of sellers and generally felt safe walking back even late at night. A real advantage of this hotel is the 'country club', around 15 mins ride away but a real haven with a good sized pool and again great service, good for escape from the hustle and heat. Overall we had a really good time and kids enjoyed it, even the culture tours and walks...",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,An Oasis of Luxury,"We stayed at La Mason Arabe for 3 nights. It was such a wonderful experience, at first glance when you are dropped off by the taxi and walk through the narrow ally you would bet apprehensive as to wht lays ahead. The minute the door is opened for you, you will get engilfed into another world that you never expected to exist. The place is simply gorgeous and unique wheras the blend of traditional and contemporary amenities are married to perfection. Everybody from the doorbell to the General manager were super nice and helpful beyond belief. We did not get to try the restuarants, but the complimentary buffet breakfast was very good, with a blend of Moroccon and western selections and as usual staff that are very attentive to your evey move and need. I personally willnot go…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,A perfect place to end an amazing journey,"We spent 3 nights here as the culmination of a 14 day tour of Morocco and we couldn't imagine anything better. The inn is made up of several adjoining houses, so be prepared for a lot of steps, but we needed the exercise after the wonderful food. We stayed in Suite 216; very spacious with lots of light, a comfortable balcony overlooking the pool and views of the garden from the sleeping area. Nice choice of amenities in the large bathroom, drinking water was replenished as needed, and lovely decor. After check-in, we were given a tour of the hotel before being shown to our suite where our luggage had already been delivered. We dined in the Moroccan restaurant the first night and the food and service were excellent. The pace was leisurely without being slow. The breakfasts…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,You can't find a better place to stay in Marrakech,"We stayed in La Maison Arabe for two nights and La Mamounia (the 5++ star hotel) for two nights, and Maison Arabe came out the winner. Authentic, charming, romantic, a little eccentric. Beautifully furnished. Lots of quiet corners. Everything is lit by candles at night and the restaurants have wonderful musicians performing at dinner. Amazing staff, good food, within walking distance of everything (if you like to walk). The hamam is better than La Mamounia. The pool at the hotel is smallish, but they have a large pool and park-area that they take you to by shuttle bus. Couldn't have had a better experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,I cannot imagine a better hotel in Marrakech,"My wife and I stayed here for 8 days in one of their 12 suites. It was an oasis of tranquility inside the high walls surrounding this hotel consisting of 6 riads pieced together. At night we couldn't even hear the calls for prayer from the neighbouring mosque. So we didn't need the earplugs and slept very well in the comfortable king size bed. Breakfast in the patio besides the pool is a good start for the day with a wide selection of fresh local fruit juices, yoghurt, fruit salad, eggs etc. This turns into a very romantic restaurant at night when the patio is covered by candlelight. The chicken tagine here can be highly recommended. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly and tries to accomodate as much as possible. After a day of wandering through the streets and alleys of…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,A perfect choice for a long weekend,"I wanted to stay in a riad and was absolutely delighted with La Maison Arabe. The staff were attentive and couldn't do enough for you - particularly the reception staff. We used the restaurant, the hamam and the country club and were impressed with them all. The hotel's location is ideal. It is small enough to feel intimate but also big enough not to feel cramped. We would definitely go back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,great place to unwind after a busy holiday in marrakech,"Fabulous place delicious food and friendly staff, highlight for us was the hotels pool where they drive you in their hotel bus, 15 mins outside the town. There you can enjoy the wonderful pool & lunch in an incredible setting with ponds and beautifully kept gardens. Fantastic",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Experience we will never forget,"This is the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in and we have stayed at 2 ""leading hotels of the world."" I read all of the wonderful reviews before going and found them all to be true. It is hard to top what Peter S said as he said it so well. There was so much beauty and detail to take in. The staff was so kind and helpful and everywhere people were waiting to serve you. The food was wonderful. We saw an article there that Winson Churchill used to regularly dine there. --We forgot our camera charger and our camera died. Adil the guest relation manager had a bellboy go out to buy us one. Since our camera was old they could only find a used one. It did not work. Imagine our surprise when we walked into the lobby and they had given us our money back as they sent the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Magical setting hidden behind the medina walls,"We were just passing this hotel and saw a small sign near our hotel. We went in and asked for a tour (always worth doing if you want to get a feel for the place). We were stunned at how huge the place was with its jazz bar, pool and restaurants. We returned 2 nights later for our best meal of the trip and also sent 2 others from our riad there for a hammam massage.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Memorable stay,"A beautiful hotel - exquisitely furnished and decorated, spotlessly clean and always comfortable. A good location approximately 10 minutes walk to Djemaa el-Fna (once you figure out the best way!) and convenient for the Nouvelle Ville, Souks, and plenty of taxis passing nearby. The staff were brilliant and could not do enough to help - always polite, friendly and approachable. I was even offered a herbal tea 'concoction' when they heard I was suffering from tummy troubles! We were given a free upgrade to a suite for our final two nights on account of it being our Honeymoon; both rooms were excellent. Breakfast is a feast with a delicious and wide selection, highlights being the fantastic home made yoghurt and made-to-order Moroccan pancakes! We used the hotel's other leisure…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Magical place! One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.,"Our first time to Marrakech and we loved i! The hotel was incredible and from the minute we arrived we were blown away. The hotel's entrance is down a plain alley but once inside the hotel is stunning. There are lots of different rooms and levels and all exquisitely decorated. We had a patio suite in the old part of the building which formed an L shape room overlooking one of the pretty courtyards with two beds in the living area for the children. The service in the the hotel is second to none and our every need was catered for including simpler dining options for our 8-year old, arranging excursions to the Atlas Mountains, guides for the Medina and Souks as well as restaurant recommendations and travel arrangements. The food too is excellent, we enjoyed the International…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Perfection!,"We are just back from a truly lovely and relaxing vacation in Marrakech with our two boys ages 10 and 11. I was expecting something ""adventurous"" and maybe a bit overwhelming at times, but the trip was relaxed and wonderful from start to finish. We spent our first few days in the mountains before coming into the city to la Maison Arabe. We were met with exceptional service and friendliness. This hotel seems to have thought of everything. There are numerous quiet corners in which to relax, curl up with a book, or enjoy the sunshine. Our boys swam every day in the heated pool and we also went out to the ""country club,"" a 15 minute drive from the hotel, one day to swim in that larger (unheated) pool.

 March 2013,5,Heart of Marrakech,I have been to Marrakech now 3 times and love it. After visiting with my husband for the second time; I decided to take my sister from the United States who had never previously held a passport. We did a girls weekend here from Europe. La Maison Arabe is the total package for a vacation destination - close to the adventure of the medina (market). No need for a car and I recommend you don't get one. Just take taxi or arrange for pick-up thru the hotel. The staff are all amazing and willing to assist their guests. The hotel's pools are refreshing and enjoyable to just look at. There are two: on property and another in the gardens which is accessible by courtesy transportation. The pool in the riad is refreshing after a day of negotiations in the market place. The spa...oh la la…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Arabian Nights,"This gorgeous riad/boutique hotel is 10 minutes from the central piazza, down an unlikely looking back street, is an ideal setting from which to discover Marrakech. The service is first class as is the attention to detail. The building itself is quite stunning and the 2 restaurants offer fine dining opportunities.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Excellent choice for Marrakesh -- location & ambience,"We were most impressed with this stay -- everyone was so helpful and friendly. The suite we had overlooked a courtyard with a nice terrace to sit outside. Huge closets, much space in the bedroom and a wonderful cozy sitting area down the hall. The furnishings are lovely too, a nice desk, artwork, pillows, etc. You have to be able to climb many stairs to get to the room -- they take your bags up as that would be a real impediment to any traveler with a large suitcase. But to go to breakfast you have to go up and down many staircases, and some are circular and small steps. Nevertheless, the climb is well worth the reward. So we would say this is one of the finest hotels we have seen during our travels in Morocco.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2012,5,What a treat!,"We stayed at 3 different places during our trip to Marrakesh and this one was our favorite! The service was exceptional and the overall ambiance of this hotel is the perfect! It really gave us the sense of being in an exotic, romantic location and the underground spa was magical and so relaxing. Waking up every morning for breakfast by the pool was a fantastic start to our day and dining in one of their two restaurants made for a wonderful ending to a full day of sightseeing. The other places we stayed at were very nice too but La Maison Arabe is the one that I hope to return to someday.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2013,5,Recommendation,"My better half and I swung by ""La Maison Arabe"" looking for a nice place with a good food. Although online reviews were quite positive about ""Les Trois Saveurs"" restaurant inside the hotel/riad, we were still surprised by what we found inside. The restaurant offers three most important things you should expect from such a place - great food, professional service, and beautiful atmosphere. If you add a good location to that list, you get a perfect place for a peaceful getaway from usual street madness of Marrakesh Medina. Don't miss it!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Great Marrakech experience,"When I visit a country I try to stay in places where I find the country’s character, culture and style. There are times that I even stayed at simple guest houses just to experience the local life. In Marrakech, luckily I found La Maison Arabe to meet my expectations. Situated within walking distance to most of the places of interest in the city, La Maison Arabe is a small boutique hotel (called “riad hotel” in Moroccan) with only 26 rooms. It was nicely and skillfully converted from an old arab house with a sympathetic swimming pool in the courtyard. The entrance is through a very narrow alley, typical of Marrakech’s old “medina”. Above all, the staff is extremely warm and friendly and very attentive. If you love to dine out of hotels, I advise you to think twice because La…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Marvel in the Medina,"Sneaked off to Marrakech 2 weeks ago, without the kid,s to quietly celebrate my wife's 50th birthday (she didn't let on!) and had 5 delightful days at La Maison Arabe. Very good food and attentive friendly staff. The country club was an oasis of calm and tranquility with a good size pool and as much or as little attention as one desired. We enjoyed a large very well appointed suite with super-comfortable bed and a balcony overlooking the smaller but eminently swimming pool at the center of the riad and are already wondering when we can go back.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Gorgeous hotel in the heart of old Marrakech with phenomenal service,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights which clearly was not long enough! Every inch of the hotel is beautifully decorated, our suite was impeccable! The food is spectacular, try their moroccan tasting menu so you get a sample of everything. Do not miss a hammam and massage treatment it's out of this world fabulous! Their service is better than the four seasons! Also they are well located and well hidden yet walking distance to the Market and the heart of old Marrakech. I would stay at this hotel over and over! It is like an oasis in the middle of the Sahara desert!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2013,5,Amazing 5 stars Riad Hotel,"On our recent business trip to Marrakesh, i discovered an amazing boutique hotel, la Maison Arabe. After long days of traveling around the city and conducting meetings , it's was such a welcome relief to come to this oasis. The front desk manager Adil and the hotel manager Nabila took care of everything for me including making sure that important documents were faxed to Boston, taking information for me on important business calls and making sure that my laundry and room was always perfectly clean and ready or me. There are plenty of large luxury hotels in Marrakesh, and they're great too, but for me it's will be La Maison Arabe for all future trips.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Beautiful Riade,"My husband and I stayed at La Maison Arabe on the last two nights of our ten day trip to Morocco. We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and wanted to experience different types of accommodations. We had a picture in our minds of how a riad should look and La Maison Arabe didn't disappoint, it's gorgeous. The food was very good, the location convenient for everything the Medina has to offer and we had a lovely quirky room, Sabah over the reception. At night all the public rooms, patios, restaurants and bars took on a magical ambiance especially around the pool area with candles and beautiful lantern lights everywhere. Oh and last but not least ALL of the staff we encountered were delightful. We thoroughly enjoyed our last two nights, a perfect ending to a perfect…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,A very pleasant stay,"We have just spent four nights in La Maison Arabe and it couldn't have been better. The staff were very attentive and kind and always looked after us. For example they made sure that we didn't pay too much for taxis and other things. The rooms were lovely, the heated pool was great and my wife really enjoyed the Hammam. It's not a long walk to the Djemaa al-fna and the Medina. We are already thinking of returning next year.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

This is NOTsome sterile hotel with staff wearing fixed smiles, but more like a friendly home with genuinely happy staff wanting to help......a rare thing in this day and age !!! We stayed here for 1 week and the welcome we received from the moment we stepped through the door to the day we left was truly exceptional and by the end of the trip we felt we were leaving friends behind. The Riad is a beautiful place, very elegant and a real oasis of calm from the busy streets of Marrakech. The food is superb, from the poolside snacks to the restaurants.

 March 2013,5,Oasis of peace and warm hospitality,"This perfect little boutique hotel, a large extended Riad really, is well situated within walking distance of all the must see attractions. The facilities and decor are superb, and the country club is just beautiful. however, what makes it the best hotel I've ever stayed in is the staff. the team of attentive, friendly and efficient people who welcome you to their hotel is absolutely top class, five star plus. I cannot think of a single thing they could do better. Food in the restaurant is good too, and cocktails in the jazz bar are not to be missed. The traditional musicians playing at the candle-lit pool made all our evenings very special, as we could enjoy them from our room, as well as in the restaurant. Will be going back one day, and will try out the spar next time!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Yet another great Riad!,"Well, back again in Marrakech. On my past trips I was stunned from all those lovely Riad's, so I tried another one this time - and again, it was a wonderful experience. Perched in a narrow street you enter into an oasis like from 1001 nights - 2 very stylish restaurants, a heated pool, Hammam, delicious breakfast and a highly motivated team. It can't get any better. I'll come back to Marrakech for sure one day!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Second time around - even better.,"It's hard to know how to write this without you thinking I work for the hotel, but it really is as good as anywhere I have stayed. They achieve a blend of remarkable service, without it looking as though they're just going through the motions, and combine this with a sense of humour and thoughtfulness. This was our second visit, and from the moment they picked us up from the airport (definitely take up this option, it is worth the cost) and dropped us off again, it was so relaxing, each day moved at a snail's pace as we gradually de-stressed. First of all, the hotel is gorgeous, and split into two halves. We stayed in the more traditional side where the rooms are a blend of all mod-cons and beautiful moroccan fixtures and artwork. There are also lots of little rooms where you…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,An Amazing place!,"We have recently returned from a 3 night stay at the fabulous La Maison Arabe which was recommend to us by a friend - we were so impressed! We were given an escorted guide around the riad on arrival, followed by tea and pastries sitting by the pool in gorgeous sunshine which felt even more special having left England on a cold wet morning. Our room was spacious and elegantly decorated in Moroccan style with complimentary wine and water (the water was renewed each day). We looked out on the swimming pool and pretty garden area with olive trees and lanterns, which when lit up in the evening was a beautiful place to be. There was so much attention to detail throughout the riad - pretty patios, amazing lighting and reflections, water features, carved wooden doors and panels, warm…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2013,5,Magical,"Just returned from a 10 day vacation to Morocco and finished our tour in Marrakech at La Maison Arabe which turned out to be the highlight of our trip. Everything we read on TripAdvisor was accurate and it really is a magical place. Location, ambiance, service and attention on the part of the Riad staff was absolutely superb. Once minor point; the shower in the bathroom should have a better protection from the rest of the bathroom as the water splashes all over every time you take a shower. Everything else was perfect",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2013,5,Wonderful,"A short late February stay in Marrakech led us to the wonderful 'La Maison Arabe' (guided there by the very helpful company 'Lawrence of Morocco'). Once through the door, you enter another world where everything is beautiful and nothing is too much trouble for the charming and helpful staff. Our bedroom was stylish, comfortable and immaculately kept. Fresh flowers and bottled water were welcome touches. We could only stay 2 nights and ate both nights at La Maison Arabe - not something we would normally choose to do when in a hotel. We were very happy that we did. Breakfasts by the pool were unhurried and totally delicious - if you are lucky your Moroccan crepe will be created for you by the wonderful lady who runs the cookery school. We hope to return and stay longer to try…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2013,5,A magical place,"Although we knew this was a good hotel we were not prepared for the magic of it. We stayed for a total of 6 nights. The splendid rooms,impeccably serviced, the attention to detail, the delicious breakfasts and complimentary afternoon tea, the incredible meals, (French and Moroccan menus) at the wonderful restaurant, all were superb. But the most important aspect was the human factor: the unforgettable staff! The personal concern, kindness, good humor, were well beyond expectations.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,The Best in Town ?,"When intending to stay in Marrakech for the first time one can only rely upon advice from friends and information from the internet. One doesn't know if the facilities, the ambience, the service or the food would be better elsewhere but having stayed at La Maison Arabe in early march we can say that all were outstanding. The gamble paid off! It is doubtful that any other hotel could match the welcome one receives and the courteous attention at all times from all the staff but one can say with some certainty that the hotel building itself and its interiors must be unmatched in Marrakech. Where a new hotel establishment may order fixtures, fittings, artefacts etc in bulk on a commercial basis, here, (as the history tells us) the aristocratic italian owner has had a hand in the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Brilliant service and lovely hotel,"In many ways I am just repeating others' views. Beautiful hotel, lots of places to sit inside and out, particularly lovely in the old part of the hotel. The service was exceptional - we felt welcomed and known throughout our 3 night stay. There were small problems all dealt with efficiently - WiFi didn't work and there was some time spent giving us different passwords to try before it did. Then we had a power cut - just in our room apparently, and it was out for a couple of hours, but we went to breakfast and were kept informed as it was sorted out. Finally an area power cut within the city was announced for the morning we left - it didn't affect us at all but all rooms had a personal letter of explanation. We also found a free bottle of champagne when we returned from dinner -…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 March 2013,5,Another fantatsic experience at the best hotel on Marrakech,"Just returned from 6 nights at La Maison Arabe. Perfect ! We stayed in a Deluxe Suite Patio side, which was great. We've previously stayed in one of the standard rooms. These are lovely too. We prefer the old part of the hotel, but that's just our opinion... My wife and I love Marrakech and this was our 5th visit in 7 years. We've spoken with many people who have visited the city, and most seem to appreciate the vibrancy, culture sights sounds and smells of the city. These can be fairly tiring... La Maison Arabe is special because it offers the most beautiful mixture of style, value and a particular approach to customer satisfaction.

We stayed in a Royal Suite which had a private roof terrace and was just what we wanted for a 3 night break away from our children! The hotel restaurant (Trois Saveurs) is excellent - we ate Moroccan food here even though there is also a Moroccan restaurant, because it's next to the pool in a lovely setting. We also did the half-day cooking course in the teaching kitchen next door, which was great fun and well-taught. It included a trip to a local bakery (this was an eye-opener) and a spice shop.

What sets it above the rest is the faultless service. Unlike so many hotels, the staff are so genuine and really do want you to have the best possible stay in their city. From the moment you walk through the door of the hotel, you become part of their family. This combined with the stunning interior décor, the wonderfully relaxed atmosphere, the delicious food, the perfect location, and a hamman experience not to be missed, makes this the best place to stay in Marrakech.

 March 2013,5,high quality; good value,"This is a good place to stay in Marrekesh. We had a very spacious room with a semi-private patio. However, friends we were travelling with had a smaller room and were not as enthusiastic about theirs for that reason. In short, not all rooms are created equal. This riad (we learned that a riad always means a large house (mansion) that has been converted into a hotel) was super clean and super quiet. Our group set up a cooking lesson that everyone liked. We did not attend it because we were too tired from a long day, but we were NOT charged for it despite a last minute cancellation. I appreciated that. BTW: this is the first review I have ever written for any hotel.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,4,"Awesome hotel, horrible city","Visiting Marrakech has been on my bucket list for decades. It was such a disappointing city - it is filthy dirty, polluted, and full of traffic and people harassing travelers. It is almost as bad as Port-au-Prince (Haiti). This hotel is superb - the service is outstanding and the location is great - but I would never go back simply because it us such an awful atmosphere in town. Food is also good. Note that there are tons of steps & stairs - it is challenging for anyone with bad knees! Don't go to the ""country club"" pool - it is not heated and there are stray cats everywhere. The garden is full of weeds.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2013,5,Can't Wait to Return!,We were pleasantly surprised by the incredible warmth and romantic ambience at the riad. I just want to return. The Hammam was quite an experience.

 March 2013,5,Stay here!,"We spent 5 nights at La Maison Arabe. From the moment we arrived we felt so very welcome and felt as if our comfort and enjoyment was a high priority to the staff. On arrival we were shown around the hotel which is beautiful. It has many areas to sit, both inside and out. Each area has its own charm. Our bedroom (216) was lovely and had a small terrace. There are two restaurants - both are very good. Attention to detail was faultless - free tea and biscuits every afternoon, free bottled water in our room, fires lit if the weather was cool, nothing was too much trouble. The Spa in the basement is delightful. The hotel also has a larger swimming pool and garden facility which can be reached by a free shuttle service. Lunch is available by the pool.

 February 2013,5,Truly outstanding hotel,One of the best vacation hotel experiences we have had. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. The food was the best we ate on out trip through Morocco.

 August 2012,5,One of the best hotel ever seen in my life,"I have been at the hotel Maison Arabe few months ago, and I could hardly have chosen a better place. It was not the first time I came to Marrakesh and I had the opportunity to stay in the most famous hotels of the city, this one tops them both for splendor of the rooms and the incomparable service. I would like to thank all the managers and the staff for the wonderful welcome and the assistance given to us from arrival until after the departure.

It's a lovely, charming and cozy hotel where stylish interior decors a la moroccan style please the eyes. We liked sitting at the courtyard and have our afternoon moroccan tea with delicious pastries and cookies. But we were firstly impressed by the ultimate service quality of the hotel staff, their friendliness and attentiveness throughout our stay. They assisted us in our special requests and went beyond our expectation.

 January 2013,5,Deceiving Location,"We had a car pick us up at the airport in Marrekech, to take us to the Riad, La Maison Arabe. The driver pulled into this alleyway, that housed an appliance store, with washing machines out side & nothing else in site, but a few doors.. He stop & told us we had arrived. My husband & I looked at each other, both of us showing much concern. We wondered what kind of place we had picked to stay in. Suddenly out of a narrow alley, a bell hop appeared with the standard brass luggage cart. He took our luggage & told us to follow him, down this very narrow alley. We then arrived at the most charming of small hotels. It is acutually a group of Riads, that were put together to make a larger complex. We just loved the place. It is so charming.

Whatever I write will never be able to do the staff, the ambience and the hotel justice but here goes... All the staff are truly amazing and the service is unsurpassed. The difference between everyone at La Maison Arabe and other 5 start hotels around the world, is that they provide service ""from the heart"" you are truly made to feel like a part of their family. Every need and requirement is anticipated and delivered with an honesty and smile that we have not experienced anywhere else. This started on arrival.

 May 2012,5,A Unique & Special Memory,"My wife and I had the distinct pleasure of staying at LA MAISON ARABE; a unique and special memory that literally with be with us forever. For our honeymoon, we decided to visit Morocco, with one of our destinations being Marrakech. At first, we were unsure where to stay as there were two other highly rated luxury hotels in the area we were considering. Our goal was to holiday in a visually unique riad that embraced the textural beauty of the city; to be pampered with high-level, honeymoon-rate services; and yet still experience an intimacy that wasn’t big hotel, but instead local, warm, kind, yet exemplary. After consulting with a travel agent, we selected LA MAISON ARABE and we cannot have made a better decision to remember our first days of marriage! We cannot – with ease…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2013,5,World Class!,"We stayed 4 nights at La Maison Arabe with our two children. Each and every one of the hotel's staff was friendly, helpful, and always smiling. There was never a need unanticipated or unmet. The meals were delicious and the hotel itself stunning. A return trip is on the list! A special mention goes out to Rashid the bartender in the Jazz Bar who effortlessly entertained our 8 and 11 yo while we had a glass of wine. He let them make their own fruit cocktails and even try their hands at helping guests. Our son cried when we left! A beautiful hotel with beautiful staff.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2012,5,Best Experience Ever!,"My girlfriend and I had the experience of our lives at La Maison Arabe! Entering from the small alleyway into an oasis of comfort, pleasure and sensation, we were greeted with exceptional and friendly service and a lovely and romantic atmosphere. Rooms are wonderful, adorned like the hotel itself, with unique local objects of great quality. The food at the hotel restaurant was the best we had in all of Morocco,in fact, among the best we had anywhere! And the spa in the basement of the hotel was incredibly relaxing, with excellent, informed service and fine cosmetics.

 December 2012,5,Simply incredible,"The title says it all - everything in the hotel was simply perfect. The service was impeccable, and I sincerely recommend any of the multiple spa treatments.

The food as well was on another level, and once again I recommend the cooking school, which was sold out apart from on Christmas day. This was definitely a unique experience.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2013,5,Highly recommend,"It was our first time to Marrakech and our honeymoon, so we got very lucky finding this riad. We were upgraded and were treated like royalty during our stay. We spent three nights here before going to Essaouira for 4 nights and returning to Marrakech for our final night. We hadn't booked anywhere for our final night but after our first stay were in no doubt - straight back to La Maison Arabe for our final night. Staff were incredible and we got such a warm welcome when we returned. One evening when we were in the bar, they dimmed the lights and brought in the musician from the restaurant to play for us and presented us with a beautiful cake to say congratulations. A complete surprise and really special. We'll definitely be coming back to stay at La Maison Arabe.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Staff were unbelievable ; I was reading my book in a little hallway one morning and after about 5 mins the bellboy came to start a fire in the fireplace just for me ! We ate at both restaurants. The Moroccan was fantastic, the tasting menu was wonderful. Waiter did add an extra 450 MAD for a bottle of wine we did not have but this was quickly rectified. Ate at the pool restaurant our 2nd night- it was less stuffy and was fantastic as well. Special thanks to Mahdi who was also so helpful ; hate to be pointing out 2 particular staff members as ALL the staff were wonderful.

 January 2013,5,Very nice Riad,Very friendly hotel. Great location - walking distance to both the old and the new town. Restaurant very nice but expensive especially the beer. They have a second pool at another location which is 15mins away - was worth the trip to go there as there are sunloungers around the pool there rather than on the roof away from the pool which is the case at riad,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2012,5,Wow!! Heaven on Earth......,"My wife and I have stayed at La Maison Arabe twice so far, and we absolutely love this hotel. It should be rated number 1 in Marrakesh – it is by far the best hotel we have stayed in bar none (and we travel most of the time and have stayed in many 5 stars hotels around the world). The staff is charming, kind and very knowledgeable. Their main concern is to make guests feel welcome and they do everything in their power to make sure we had a lovely time. The staff speaks excellent English and this hotel is a perfect choice for anyone (families, couples and singles) and for a first visit or returning visit to Marrakesh.

 November 2012,5,Great riad hotel,"My wife and I were not in agreement about coming here. I wanted a larger hotel, she insisted on a riad. She won out and I was ready to prove her wrong. I must admit she was right on this one. La Maison Arabe bills itself as a riad/hotel whereas it is much, much larger than I expected. It seems to be a series of different riads and buildings put together, yet everywhere my wife had that cozy feeling she was hoping to get from a typical riad. We enjoyed exploring the hotel and discovering something new every day. The front desk personnel were very helpful in organizing our stay in Marrakech. Very friendly and professional staff, everything done with a smile and one that seemed sincere and not forced. The staff seemed happy, which is a sign of a good establishment. We loved our…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 January 2013,5,Simply the Best!,"I can't say enough about the service my family and I received at La Maison Arabe. While the accommodations we had were phenomenal, what really sets Maison Arabe apart is the incredibly friendly and helpful staff. When my 18-year old son was sick and unable to join the rest of the family sightseeing, the hotel manager called him every hour to check up on him. The manager also had food and special tea sent to the room to help my son get better. We were always greeted by name and throughout the rest of our stay, everyone asked my son how he was feeling. The food -- especially the pastilla at lunch -- was exceptional. I would highly recommend La Maison Arabe to anyone visiting Marrakech.

The hotel is in traditional Morrocan Riad style and decorated beautifully with Islamic style artwork. The staff are so friendly and efficient. They remember your name, your room number, your drinks order - everything. The two restaurants (one traditional Morrocan, the other more international) serve a very high standard of cuisine and the Morrocan wines are excellent. We attended the Cookery School and, although quite hard work, we learned how to make tagine which was then our lunch. Another great place in the hotel is the Jazz Bar where Rachid makes everyone feel so welcome.

It is beautifully decorated, the rooms are amazing, the whole atmosphere is about elegance and beauty. The restaurant is awesome and dont miss the ""milk pastilla"" for dessert! my favorite! At dinner time, there are multiple musicians playing, alternating between soft traditional moroccan music and luth.

They supported us when we wanted to arrange a short tour with a very professional Spanish guide, really an excellent selection from their side. We also had dinner at the Marroquian restaurant the first night of our arrival and it was so nice…the atmosphere at the restaurant brings you to old years and make you feel really relax.

The place is a real sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech, just a ten minute walk from the square. The manager and all the staff were extremely helpful with nothing being too much trouble. Breakfasts were delicious and served by the pool. Both restaurants served lovely morrocan food and were the best meals we ate on our trip.

The next morning we were greeted with an elaborate breakfast buffet consisting crepe and eggs made to our liking. After a long day of walking in the souks, we treated ourselves to a spa/Hamam.

 January 2013,5,Perfect mix of Arabia and Italien chic,"We just returned from a 5 day stay in Marrakech where we lodged in the Maison Arabe. It is absolutely fabulous: very friendly but discrete staff, gorgeous rooms and delicious meals. And to top this, their spa and hammam is out of this world. I did not want to leave. The location in the old city is perfect as well, as while it is very central it is not part of the crazy busy Souks. We would definitely go there again if we had the opportunity. Prices, given the service and what we would have paid in a comparable hotel in Europe was also reasonable.

Location: it is an oasis of beauty and comfort in the Medina, the old city, easy walking distance to major must-see sights. Facilities: superb combination of several old Riad mansions, including graceful dining in arcades flanking the pool and surprisingly well-equipped stations for the fun cooking class. We found the food to be uniformly excellent. And in the softly lit Hammam we were treated like robed royalty. Service: this was the crowning touch, starting with the warmth of Nabila Dakir, the general manager. Managers usually inhabit a back office, managing staff by direction.

I also suggest taking dinner at the restaurant one night for a beautiful- and plentiful- presentation of Moroccan dishes. It was too cool to swim when we where there but the pool area is lovely.

Terrific room, large, good closet space, nice view overlooking the pool and outdoor restaurant/lounge area. It does get loud at night because of the music from the bar and restaurant, but it's not the bad and it does go too late. The service is terrific. Everyone at the front desk is so wonderful.

Nothing was too small or too large for them to assist us with. The food was undoubtedly some of the best we have eaten anywhere. Contrast this with some of the huge and indifferent hotels in and around the ""New Town"" as we did and you will be very pleased you chose our hotel, unless that is you like clueless staff and no service as in La Palmeria where we went in search of a Japanese restaurant. We ended up back at our hotel and a free glass of champagne offered by our hotel Director who ensured we got a meal even though both his restaurants were fully booked. That's what I call service.

 December 2012,5,One of the best hotels ever stayed.,"Every detail of this hotel is thought carefully. The Moroccan decoration is amazing; we were astonished with the lamps. The location is very convenient (not inside, but only 10 min. walking from the Djemaa el-Fna). The room is clean and spacious, with a big bed and good bathroom. The only point of improvement is the shower, which does not have enough pressure (but it is not bad at all). The hotel service is extraordinary, the staff is very helpful and they are very concerned with our experience. We certainly recommend the Hotel's Hammam (the Moroccan bath). One little tip is for the breakfast. It is great, but it lacks some ""sweet"" options -- nothing to dampen the quality of the breakfast. I would certainly stay in this hotel again. It set the accommodation bar very high. It is…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2012,5,Exceptional Second Visit to La Maison Arabe - Perfect Hotel,"We had the great pleasure of staying at La Maison Arabe for an amazing second visit in November. This hotel has the most exceptional and caring staff of any hotel we have ever visited. Also, for a second visit, we were so delighted to see that the same incredible customer service was still as wonderful as our first visit. The General Managers of the hotel, Taoufik and Nabila are fantastic and made our 15th wedding anniversary the most unforgettable experience that we have ever had. Thank you to you both and all the staff for making it so special.

 November 2012,5,Perfect Birthday Experience,"We had travelled through Morocco starting in Tangier then onto Fez, Casablanca and finally ending our trip with 3 nights in Maison Arabe for my wife's birthday. Of all the Riads and hotels that we have stayed in during our travels Maison Arabe was quite simply the best. The attention to detail from all the staff, ensuring that all our needs were met from the front desk staff, the waiting staff, everyone takes a great pride in their roles and the hotel. In particular the staff at the cooking school, Waha and Fatima ensured my wife had a fantastic experience on her birthday learning to cook a traditional Moroccan menu.

 November 2012,5,A wonderful experience,"It was our first visit to Marakesh ad we were very uncertain as to where to stay. Our nephew had recommended Maison Arabe with glowing colours, so we finally opted for it. When we arrived, we were welcomed by the charming Nabila, as well as all the smiling and happy faces, too many to mention. The hotel has so much old world charm, it really is like staying in somebody's home, as a privileged guest. We found the whole experience extremely relaxing and the staff couldn't have been more helpful, organizing whatever we wanted. We thoroughly recommend the Haman and Massage centre in the basement too, The breakfast was also lovely, although they do need to work on their eggs. Dinner a pleasure around the pool with Moroccan or European options. From start to finish they were so…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2012,5,Lost Passport - stay here,We went to Marrakech for a long weekend to explore the sights and do the hotel's cookery course. On arrival at La Maison my husband had lost his passport. The manager organised someone to accompany him everywhere to get a replacement. The manager eventually went with him to the consul. We had to drop out of cooking but ate wonderful food in the restaurant and relaxed in the Hammam. The hotel is well positioned. I could wander off by myself to the Souk and shop. I took the courtesy bus to the country club 15 mins drive away to relax by the pool with my book and complimentary cocktail whilst he went from office to office. We checked out of our room at noon. Our flight was not till 8pm so they allowed us to use the Royal suite to change and freshen up. Afternoon tea and the IHT at…,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2012,5,A Peaceful Oasis,"La Maison Arabe is a treat. I just loved my all-too-short stay here. The staff was so friendly and kind. The breakfast buffet was amazing with the most delicious homemade yogurt. When you arrive at the little street, at first you wonder where the hotel is - then you enter into a small exquisite lobby and are transported to another world - one of peace and tranquility. Discreet rooms throughout the hotel provide for a welcome respite from the outside. Each room is comfortable and cozy. It would be wonderful to spend each season in the hotel - my regret is that I only had 2 nights!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 November 2012,5,Amazing setting,"We attended a cookery course here, it was the most professional and the most fun course we have ever done.

 October 2012,5,Total pampered relaxation,"The entrance to the hotel down a pedestrian alley was daunting, but actually characterizes the whole place, understated private luxury. There was enough to do within the premises that you didn't need to get out if you didn't want to. The staff helped us with taxis, excursions. Restaurants lovely. Cooking school lots of fun. The spa - awesome. We asked them how they managed to light all the candles - there are thousands! Afternoon tea, graciously offered and served by the staff was naturally included in the price of the suite, as were fresh flowers. The two swimming pools are great. Within the hotel in the middle of the restaurant, it works. And the external pool and its garden is lovely.

 November 2012,5,Can't say enough positives..!,"Stayed here for a long weekend at the start of November and had a wonderful time. On arrival, the hotel frontage isn't in any way ostentatious and is relatively small and unassuming. It's only when you enter the building that you realise how wonderful the hotel is. The hotel has its own swimming pool, 3 restaurants and a number of rooms; which are spread across 2 floors. We stayed in one of the junior suites and it was a spacious room with all of the things you'd expect such as minibar and air con Etc. We ate in their Moroccan restaurant on our first night and the food was really good. Breakfasts are buffet style and are again really good. Didn't get to try the pool sadly as it was 10 degrees outside and was very cold! The hotel is also well situated in the medina and we…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 November 2012,5,Fantastic Experience,"This riad hotel is one of the best places i have stayed in the world. The building and furnishings are charming, lots of rooms with open fires, beautifully furnished, leading one off the other and opening onto charming courtyards. The staff especially on reception are just so helpful. On the last day we had a late evening flight and had to be out of our room by 12.00 noon, reception gave us another room where we could leave our cases and freshen up until we departed. Apart from a lovely breakfast (try the homemade yoghurt), afternoon tea was also included, served between 3-6pm. You could have any type of tea or coffee with a selection of small Moroccan pastries.

We were able to use the shower facilities before our late flight after checking out which we really appreciated. Would highly recommend.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2012,5,"Beautiful riad, well located, outstanding staff","Stunning riad, well located for the medina and souk. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for. Staff outstanding - never experienced better. My only cricicism would be the 5.30 am alarm call from the morning call to prayer, which woke us all every day. But if you complain about this, you should probably stay in leafy Surrey. Morocco is a fascinating country - safe, polite, relatively little hassle factor. Highly recommended if you would like to experience another culture, but find the thought of India or Egypt a little overwhelming. Strongly also recommend a trip to the Atlas mountains - unexpectedly beautiful.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2012,5,Simply outstanding,"The hotel as well as the restaurant are truly exceptional. Our room was spacious and luxurious. The food was exceptional. Dinners, cocktails, breakfast, all memorable. In the morning ask for an omelette or eggs with ""everything"" in it. You will love it. The homemade yogurt is also excellent. Great wine selection. The Rose wine from Morocco was a nice surprise, similar to those Rose of Provence. The staff goes beyond any expectations, always attentive, truly intent in making your stay exceptional. We could have stayed there for weeks...",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2012,5,Dinner and Cocktails at Maison Arabe,"Our Riad recommended Maison Arabe for dinner. It was just round the corner, down one of the alleys that are so typical of Marrakech. Once inside though, it is difficult to believe something so beautiful and tranquil could be hidden behind the grotty walls. We had pre dinner drinks in the Jazz Bar. The service excellent and dinner was delicious. We sat by the pool with a heater, as it was a little chilly and my wife was offered a blanket too. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we returned for our final night dinner. We'd especially like to thank the barman in the Jazz Bar. His cocktails were amazing and his house special was especially fab, with a cheeky vodka added. He made us feel most welcome and nothing was too much trouble, even when the bar got a bit busy, he made sure we…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The staff are exceptional . . . they knew us by name and were helpful, responsive and friendly. The property is intimate, atmospheric and beautifully located. It's down an alley, so removed from the hustle-bustle and noise of the city. Hint: the homemade yogurt on the breakfast buffet was delicious. Room service is prompt and free of charge. It's very close to a mosque, so expect to be awakened early if you sleep with your windows open! There are a lot of wonderful hotels and riads in Marrakech - but this one rates a Perfect 10!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2012,5,Perfect Holiday,What a fantastic half term holiday for the family! The location within a few minutes walk of the Night Market and the Souk was perfect. The Hotel organised a very good guide to show us around and get our bearings. The cookery course was also incredibly well organised. The food and service was also excellent. Our children (11 & 13 yrs) loved the experience. The Country Club (a short minibus ride away) was spectacular - with a beautiful pool/restaurant/gardens to investigate. An Oasis of calm. I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough. You will not be disappointed.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2012,5,Absolutely amazing hotel!,"Let me first say that I have been to a few hotels in Morocco that have looked pretty enough but have had horrible service. Not so at La Maison Arabe. Not only is the hotel beautiful, but the service is impeccable. Everyone is incredible friendly and polite, even when we had a fussy and at times troublesome 3 year old running around (they were incredibly patient with her and played with her often). The hotel offers a cooking class which my wife took, the chef would take you to a nearby market and show which ingredients to pick, and then show you how to cook them at the hotel kitchen. The breakfast buffet is amazing, and their restaurant has great food and Tajine. The rooms are spacious and clean (the room gets cleaned twice a day!). Everything was amazing, I am coming back here…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2012,5,Top-quality experience overall,"Love this place! I would rate this place a 10 if possible. Here is the deal in a nutshell: Fantastic: 1 - The building/rooms----oozing with atmosphere.

I'm not kidding! 3 - 5* Moroccan restaurant - Fabulous food, nice music, impeccably decorated. 4 - Location - Right in the middle of the Medina...perfect! 5 - Lap pool - It is a heated pool but unfortunately was not heated during our stay. We still swam laps but it was cold. 6 - Excellent Hamam/spa 7 - Fun hands-on cooking class resulting in an excellent meal. 8 - Some fantastic Moroccan wines Minor issue: 1 - Breakfast is understaffed.

The hotel itself has a great atmosphere and consists of a number of lovely courtyards on different levels. Our suite of rooms was just wonderful, with two terraces filled with the scent of jasmine and birdsong. We had dinner in both restaurants where delicious food is served with wonderful live background. For anyone who wants to learn to cook Moroccan food, the half day cookery courses are great fun and an excellent introduction to the art of cooking with a tagine. When you want to escape the the frenzy of the Souks, a lovely garden and swimming pool also with impeccable service, just outside the medina can be reached by a complementary bus.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 October 2012,5,WOW is just not enough to say!,"What do you say when you arrive to one of the most interesting places in the world? But to also have that at your finger tips with the service and people at the hotel you just cannot explain it. These people are so helpful, gracious and cratering to all your needs at all times.

 August 2012,5,Excellent Riad in The Medina,"We are 2 females who recently traveled to Morocco for the first time. We flew into Marrakesh and hotel staff picked us up at the airport(we emailed them ahead of time). The staff at La Maison Arabe made us feel at home immediately. In particular, Hicham(at the front desk) gave us great and honest advice on how to best see the city. He was amazing! The facilities include a poolside restaurant and a bar with fabulous Moroccan wine. We also took the cooking class, and we highly recommend it. Wafa was our instructor, and Fatima was the assistant. It's a great way to learn about Moroccan cuisine and culture. This hotel is well worth the cost, especially if it's your first trip to Morocco! Thank you La Maison!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 September 2012,5,Cooking Class,"Having eaten the most amazing meals here I signed up for their cooking class which I would hightly recommend. The chef demonstrated and a translator helped us in preparing a full meal in the very modern school with the latest technology. We could choose what we wanted to cook, my choice being Chicken with Apricot and Argan oil.We all received a copy of directions and a special gift.

Wonderful tangines. Had lunch twice at the poolside restaurant and enjoyed everything we ordered. Also bought several items from their gift shop. The second day we went to the Hammam and also had massages. It is a beautiful spa. The staff went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect.

The service was not only the best service I've gotten in Morocco (and I've been around in Casablanca, Tangier, Rabat, Oujda, Ouarzazate, all in branded hotels); the service was first class by international standards. The staff were all friendly and helpful, all spoke excellent English, with nothing but smiles on their faces. The amenities were great too, the hotel restaurant had really good selections and not just local Moroccan dishes (which were also really good).

We were only there for a long weekend, which was not enough to experience everything that the hotel had to offer. We did not use the wonderful spa or learn in the cookery school but we certainly hope to go back and try these facilities. The main swimming pool is at the hotel's country club. A courtesy bus leaves the hotel each hour for a 15 minute drive which takes you passed the Royal Palace to a peaceful haven.

 October 2012,5,Excellent choice for a Marrakech experience,"Having just returned from 4 nights in La Maison Arabe (MA) we were satisfied that we had enjoyed a fantastic short break in Marrakech which had exceeded our expectations. We had chosen the perfect place to stay within the Medina walls and a short walk to the hustle & bustle of the main square and the souks. Our suite in the older part of the Riad had a typically Morrocan feel which made you smile every time you walked through the door. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom beautiful and the room was so peaceful (except the occasional calls to prayer from the local mosque!!!).

 June 2012,5,Just wonderful!,"My goodness, this is a beautiful hotel. I took my ""baby"" sister to Morocco for her 65th birthday. We wanted to go to a place that was as different as could be from our small town lives. Marrakech fit the bill. While out on the streets we felt as American as we must have looked. But in this lovely hotel, we never felt like anything but family. I loved all the beautiful knick-knacks and the carved plaster. The food was delicious. We ate in all of the restaurants and the bar. I wanted to try everything on all of the menus because everything was so yummy. We even went out to the country pool for an afternoon. The gardens there were lovely and I loved listening to and watching all the birds that flit around the pool and cafe. We splurged for a spa treatment too, and it was so…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 August 2012,5,Wonderful riad,We spent 4 nights here in early August. It was awesome. Lovely hotel and great location. Tried a hammam for hte first time. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.

Enjoyed Morocco very much.,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2012,5,"A small, luxurious hotel","We were attracted to La Maison Arabe by it's facilities - restaurant, piano bar and country club. Having recently experienced a stay in a true riad, it was very civilised to be able to have a pre dinner drink in the bar while we perused the restaurant menu. The restaurant itself was in a lovely setting and the food was good. It was easy and relaxing to go to dinner without leaving the hotel. We thought we'd died and gone to heaven when we spent the day at the country club. The service there was outstanding. Perhaps we didn't choose our room too wisely as it was very narrow and we were woken by the pre dawn call to prayer each night. There is a mosque close by. Also be aware that a 10% service charge is levied on all food and beverage, even on a bottle of water.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 September 2012,5,"First class hotel, prime location","Absolutely loved this place which hasn't lost any of its original charm but boasts all modern facilities. We couldn't fault the service. I could rant on and on about how great it is but it has been more than adequately covered by others, so thought I would add in some things you should do when you're here: 1 take mint tea in the salon 2 take lunch in the central patio area (we recommend the assorted Moroccan entrees washed down with some Moroccan wine) 3 take a cocktail in the Jazz Bar 4 don't miss the fantastic leather goods shop in the Ensemble Artisanale, 5 minutes walk from the hotel, its fixed price, relaxed shopping.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

We read the reviews for this place and decided this was the one. To say Marrakech was a culture shock for 2 Iowa girls raised on a farm is an understatement! But we never expected to be so welcomed as we were, especially at La Maison Arabe. It started life many years ago as a famous Moroccan restaurant and was turned into this charming little hotel by an Italian prince. We felt like princesses here.

 September 2012,5,A haven of tranquility amid the hustle and bustle,"From the moment we were greeted from the airport and chauffeur driven to the Maison Arabe we knew we were going to be staying at a fine place. We walked down a narrow alley way and then through a small side door and were bowled over by its warm surroundings and friendly staff. We had a welcome drink in the courtyard and then a tour of the hotel. It was a maze of rooms ranging from a elegant spa, sophisticated jazz bar and relaxing pool area. It was friendly, smart but not formal. A great combination. The country club is a must! Ishlam on reception was so helpful. All the staff were very pleasant.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,A tranquil spot in the middle of town,"We felt we were in safe hands the moment we walked in and were ushered over to sit by the pool and served a refreshing orange and carrot juice. We were in one of the Royal Suites and the room was fantastic. Comfortable, well thought through and with large very clean bathrooms. The roof terrace was the reason we went for the Suite and it was just perfect. We had breakfast there every day looking across the rooftops of Marrakesh and it was the ideal spot for some private sunbathing - and it had a jacuzzi! The main hotel restaurant in the evening was like a film set. Arranged around the pool, subtly lit and with wonderful food it was a terribly romantic dinner making us both feel very special. Staff were extremely helpful and efficient - the climb up to the roof terrace to…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

It was a surprise finding it tucked away in the back streets - it's really convenient for Djemaa el Fna but also a pleasant stroll away from the mayhem. The staff at every level were incomparable, absolutely charming and lovely and nothing was too much trouble, they even filled in our departure cards long before we needed them so they were ready for our return flight! The shuttle to the Palmerie piscine proved a lifesaver after the bustle and heat of the medina. I really hope we can return one day.

In amongst the madness of Marrakech is this haven of peace and tranquility made even better by the staff who are just amazing, nothing was too much trouble, they are the best. Having read the comments on Tripadvisor I had very high expectations, these were not only met but far exceeded. The location is ideal, a few minutes from the souks and 5-10 mins from the main square. The hotel is beautifully decorated and authentically Moroccan, some reviewers have noted its a tiny bit worn in places, but this is really minimal and if anything, adds to the experience.

 September 2012,5,Still a top place to stay,"Very happy to return to La Maison Arabe after a first visit last year, although a bit disappointed that my room this time was right next to the room we had last time, so I didn't get to see more of the place. But this room was insulated from the pre-dawn call to prayer, so that issue, the only negative from my last visit, went away. This time I visited the off-site pool which was a great respite from the +40 degree heat. Non alcoholic drinks are available, charged to one's room. The breakfast is now via a buffet, but with people operating griddles to prepare fresh egg etc dishes. I thought this was a bit of a come-down from the last time I was there, where things were brought from the kitchen. Breakfast this time maybe 8/10 vs 10/10 before.

The hotel itself was beautiful, from the quiet secluded courtyard to the quality restaurant. The rooms were clean and a nice size with all the usual amenities. My highlight was the country club which can be reached by courtesy shuttle, this was pure luxury. In a city that i found one of the most chaotic i have ever visited, lying by the pool in the country club provided me some much needed relaxation.

The staff are the nicest I have experienced at a hotel and I have stayed at many around the world. No request is to much and they go out of there way- an example filling in departure forms on our behalf for the airport. The hotel itself is beautiful, it is the perfect combination between a riad and a hotel. The rooms(suites) are spacious and have all the modern amenities you could need.

Adil and his team of staff were brilliant and as well as catering for our every need in the hotel they provided endless helpful, advice and directions for our times outside of the riad which was priceless having found out how chaotic the streets of Marrakesh and in particular the souks can be.

We were invited to the Piano Bar for pre-dinner cocktails and were give a brief history of the property. Over cocktail we were given time to look over the menu and wine list and or order was taken in advance of us being brought to our table. The Piano Bar has a VERY 'cool' feel and history oozes from every pore in the room. We were brough to our table and had our mind blown by the Poolside location - simply FANTASTIC!

 August 2012,5,Fantastic pool just outside the city.,"We just returned from 4 days at La Maison Arabe during a heat wave in Marrakech. What absolutely saved the trip for us was the country pool that belongs to the hotel. There is a free shuttle service provided by the hotel to get out there (around 15 minutes more or less). Our mouths just dropped the first afternoon we went out there. The pool and gardens around it are gorgeous, and the lunches served out there were delicious. It was the perfect place for rest and relaxation, I don’t know how we could have survived the heat otherwise. At the hotel, our large suite was thankfully air conditioned from the moment we stepped in. The hotel staff went out of their way at every moment to make sure we had a great time.

 August 2012,5,Great experience at La Maison Arabe,"This is a lovely small hotel in the old part of Marrakech. The entrance is only a half a block from a main street, so the walk to the hotel along the pedestrian alley is a short one. We asked the hotel for pick up service from the airport, which worked out perfectly. We had very nice rooms that were beautifully decorated, with modern bathrooms and nice amenities.

The Riad is a small ( 26 bedroom) and very personal place to stay. Each member of staff engages and really seeks to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. You feel their interest without it being intrusive. They organised some really good guides for us to tour the city and go out into the mountains. The cuisine is very good. Our room was spacious and overlooked the pool so it was quiet ( but then the location of the hotel is in a quiet side street but very accessible for touring the Medina).

If you are looking for an authentic place to stay with the essence of Morocco all around you, then this place is for you. We were upgraded to a room with a large private terrace, where we were served breakfast every morning.

The style is participative, so everyone has a station with all of the ingredients in front of them, along with a TV showing what the head cook is demonstrating and mirrors so you can see her as well. Our class was just the 3 of us--a mom and two teenagers--so we would just gather around to see what the chef was demonstrating. Then you would cook your own lunch and eat it around the pool or in the restaurant. We did an aubergine salad with a tomato rose, a courgette salad, chicken tagine and a pastry dessert.

Very impressive. We made moroccan bread, chicken tangine and two salads, which were consumed at the end of the class.

Its an interesting concept because there is an attention to service that you find in a small or family-run place (we were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived), and then there are dining and spa options usually available only in a larger hotel. Everything was top-notch here: large and impeccably clean room, excellent food at the poolside restaurant. We fell in love with the hotel's Private Gardens which one gets to by a free car service. The temperature got very hot while we were in Marrakech and it was great to escape there and swim all afternoon. One day my husband and I shared the whole place with just one other couple.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 June 2012,5,"""Terrific place to stay when in Marrakech",General Tours booked our small travel group here for our 3-night stay in Marrakech. This place is a gem. An excellent breakfast is served by the pool and the staff is welcoming and attentive. A shuttle runs frequently to their resort for those wanting a larger pool in which to swim. We had a comfortable room overlooking a lovely courtyard (see photo).,La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2012,5,Wonderful surprise,"My husband and I went to Morroco for the first time and trusted an agency to book the hotels for us. The moment we got there, from the outside it look scary and we thought it was going to be a nightmare, but the moment we stepped inside it all changed. The place is a beautiful jewel and the staff is helpful and nice, specially Ibrahim at the front desk. The ambiance of the bar is amazing, and the bartender playful and professional, the hammam (spa) peaceful and lovely. The food at the restaurant is good but a little lonely. We stayed at one of the newer rooms with a view of the pool; they are super clean and comfortable. I would definitely come back here and recommend it. Be careful walking back from the main plaza late at night; even if everybody said it was safe, we felt…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,Exceeded All Expectations,"we visited La Maison Arabe the end of May. We were attending a conference where most were staying at Four Seasons, Sofitel, La Mamounia etc. We couldn't have been happier. Hotel atmosphere is like walking into a movie set (the lighting, little hidden nooks, sounds, calmness) not to mention the staff who could not have done more for us. Upon arrival we were shown into a room up flights of stairs. my husband is recovering from knee issue and we were upgraded to elevator part of hotel immediately. Restaurant setting is around a pool with beautiful lighting at night. Quality of food was as good as anywhere we tried out of hotel. And they have a country club with pool, restaurant, beds to lie around to get away from city. Location is 10 mins from square while many big hotels are…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,The Place To Be In Marrakesh,"There are two places to stay in Marrakesh for the traveler looking for a superior experience. The first is, of course, La Mamounia, which is the ultimate in the big hotel experience. For those looking for smaller, more intimate and charming place, there is only La Maison Arabe. Unlike the Relais & Chateux property in Marrakesh, Mason L'Orange (which I also visited), La Maison Arabe perfectly blends the riad experience with that of a luxury hotel. There are three reasons for this. First, unlike many of the newer boutique riads, La Maison Arabe is not just one central courtyard that makes you feel a bit locked-in. Rather, its a bit of a rambling property made up of six separate but connected riads. Second, the hotel's nearby garden/swimming pool, which is a 15 minute (free) van…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,Fabulous boutique hotel!!,"Our group of 7 friends were guests of this marvelous place for 3 days. Everything was meticulously delivered--food, ambience, location, staff, and the appointments within the rooms. All of our rooms had two balcony patios overlooking the large courtyard below. The food was so good that we were tempted not to bother with local restaurants. I would go back in a heartbeat, and recommend it wholeheartedly.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 June 2012,5,A hidden Gem. But not your ordinary Hotel,"I love this place. But it is not for the ordinary traveller. I love boutique hotels. Those off the main streets where you get a true flavor of the area. It is a Riad so it is an old palace in an alley. There are so many little rooms that i am still trying to figure out where everything is. The rooms are spacious with A/C, Wi Fi and TV. The beds are comfortable and the staff is very warm and friendly. However, this is not for the ritz Carleton or the Marriott crowd. Our room was a 3 floor walkup. The style is a little worn but I would definitely come back again. There is a Hamman which shouldn't be missed. I would guess anyone going to Marrakech has to be a little adventurist so clearly this shouldn't bother them. Come here. You won't be disappointed!!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 April 2012,5,LOVE THIS PLACE!,"An excellent place to stay or just have dinner or drinks. The bar area is fun and the pool-side dining was dramatic and delicious. The service was very good, the guys at the front desk were amazingly kind and helpful and the spa experience was beautifully executed.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,Wonderful Oasis,"Just spent 4 days at this hotel and we can't rate it highly enough. Beautiful building, with an opulent decor, very atmospheric at night with candles lighting everywhere. If you want to be in the heart of the Medina but removed from the hussle and bustle this is the place. Great food and very attentive service, I forgot my camera battery charger and the manager took it away and charged for me. For fabulous lazy days try the hotel garden on the outskirts of MARRAKECH with bali beds, a great pool and once again superb food, bit like a private party. We'll be back!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,Peaceful and relaxing island in the chaos of Marrakech,"We had a wonderful stay here on our honeymoon. It was the perfect place to relax, enjoy a Hammam treatment, have really good morroccan meals, and listen to live piano music as you enjoy a drink in their bar. The staff were all very professional and helpful. The hotel itself should be in a guidebook as it is beautiful and very luxurious! We needed the calm and relaxing environment after hectic shopping and trips around the city. Quite expensive but well worth the money! If we go back we will definitely go there again.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,"Highly recommended, perfect service","Excellent highly trained and friendly staff, very helpful and polite. We enjoyed perfect service from everyone - starting from the bell-boy and to the guys on the reception. Restaurants serve delicious food, however it should be noted that the “European” restaurant serves food prepared Moroccan style;), to be honest we didn’t see much difference between the European and Moroccan restaurants. The breakfast is ok, could use some more variety, the SPA is good. The rooms could use slippers (we never received ours) and on-site they have only one swimming pool - an outdoor pool in close proximity to the restaurant (the eating guests sit close to it), so we saw no one during our stay using it. The indoor pool is a 15-minute trip on a shuttle bus (at least we were told so, didn’t go…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

 May 2012,5,Exceptional Staff,"On a recent trip to Marrakech my daughter and I visited La Maison Arabe for dinner, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who was most accommodating as we didn't have a reservation and they were busy. We were seated next to the pool - enjoyed cocktails (try the Singapore Sling)! Then due to a full restaurant they set a table for us by the pool again where we enjoyed traditional Moroccan cuisine. Can't comment on the rooms as only there for dinner but if they match the experience we had - then well worth a visit to a beautiful property.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,Just the Cookery School,"No budget for the hotel itself but the girls decided to do the half day cookery course. It was great. The set up is awesome, proper work stations, with TV screens showing the lady demonstrating. We got a tour of a local bakery and a short lesson on the history of the city and it's spices. The staff a quite funny too, which helps when you start concentrating too hard on chopping veg! We made a tagine, and two salads, then got to eat it all. Made a nice change from the madness of the City, and if you're into booking you'll have a great time.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 May 2012,5,My thoughts are on La Maison Arabe-Honeymoon,"We set off to La Maison Arabe on 11th May 2012 . We were greeted by very friendly staff who were attentive and very respectful. We were shown to our room through a beautiful courtyard where the room was spacious, clean and more improtantly had air-con as it was 40 degrees plus through the day. Breakfasts were wonderful and again the staff were attentive ensuring that we were informed of the variety of foods available. If this is your first time (like ours) please ask the reception for detail of what to see in Marrkech as you will receive a detailed description of what to do and see. We were given a map with points jotted on of recommendations - We had two evening meals in the hotel and found them very good value and enjoyed the live music which added to the Morrocan experience.…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

Fast forward to winter 2011/2012 and I found myself there albeit in somewhat different circumstances - a little bit older, wiser and wealthier. This time I invited my daughter and her new husband to join me and we had great experiences. Morocco is as wonderful as I remember it - full of charm, beauty and first class hospitality. Our hotel, a privately owned Riad in the center of the old city souk was La Maison Arabe. What a great place. They took care of everything making sure that we were comfortable and safe.

 May 2012,5,Wonderful and Amazing Place to Stay in Marakech,"We have just spent the last week at La Masion Arabe and had the best experience at a hotel ….ever. We had researched many hotels in the area and had chosen Masion Arabe due to the good reviews and especially the outstanding reviews about the staff – and even then, they beat all our expectations. We spend our lives travelling for business and have stayed all over America and Europe and have never had the outstanding service that this hotel provides. The hotel is stunning; it is an old Riad that has been beautifully restored with hidden courtyards, a mystical pool and beautiful restaurants and cozy nooks all around the hotel. Our suite was amazing – we stayed in the Aladdin suite, which was lovely with a private terrace looking over the pool (although we also peeked in a regular…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

A beautiful place, so warm and welcoming the staff our fantastic, so helpful and pleasant. The hotel is so beautiful and so much attention to detail everywhere, I loved all the fresh roses. I had probably the best massage ( invigorating massage) ever and so would thoroughly recommend a bit of pampering after the sight seeing. The Jazz bar is very relaxing for a few cocktails pre dinner On the last day we decided to go to the country club - wow - this is paradise. WE were lucky enough to have the whole place to ourselves, amazing, finished off our holiday perfectly. I look forward to my return......

 May 2012,5,Charming little gem in Marrakech,"It is amazing that this little boutique hotel with 26 roomd has 2 restaurants, 1 jazz lounge, 1 tea salon and 1 spa. Every space in this hotel is tastefully furnished with Moroccan flavour. They just have good eyes for beautiful and charming details. The room (Nassim) we stayed has a little shared courtyard which opens to the sky above. There is a semi private patio where you can sit in the evening and gaze the stars. It is very quiet and us such a relieving contrast with the mess out in the town. A hallmark of this little hotel is the exemplary demonstration of the Moroccan hospitality. Almost everyone here including the housekeepers are friendly and caring. Special mention goes to Hicham of the front desk and Rachid the head bartender. Their service has been sincere…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The staff couldn't have been freindlier , the front desk people were very knowledgeable and helpful, the restaurant and spa were both at a very high level of quality and service.Breakfast here is included in the price of the room and was unbelievable.

 April 2012,5,Outstanding staff,"We went to Marrakech with another couple that ended up staying in a much more well known hotel where the rooms are twice the price of La Maison Arabe. We would go back and forth between both establishments and all I can say is thatafter comparing, we are thrilled and relieved we chose to stay here. There is a personalized service at La Maison Arabe that I believe is just impossible at a large hotel. After the first day, the breakfast staff remembered how we like our coffee. After the first day, many people working at La Maison Arabe were addressing us by name, and the barman would know immediately what to serve me and remembered exactly how Ilike my martini. There was always the sense that everyone was going the extra mile to ensure we had a perfect stay. And it seemed everyone…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2011,5,Fantastic Riad Hotel with amazing countryclub garden,"We stayed at La Maison arabe for five nights as a family of five. We had both a suite and a double room in different parts of the hotel. Both accomodations were very good and the breakfast was delicous, freshly made to order. The most amazing and breathtaking part of the experience though was the multitude and elegance of all the common areas. You could sit down for a talk or to do some reading in a wast variety of different places alltrough the hotel. There were garden areas, secluded sitting room areas, patios and in addition an elegant and inviting Jazzbar. The Hotel is situated only a 5-10 min walk from the Medina.

The attention to deatils, the ambiance, especially at night and the staff ALL combine to make this a perfect choice for lodging. The morning we were to check out we noticed that one of our main duffle style luggage pieces had a seam that was giving way and would probably not survive the trip home. The front desk said, we will repair it, no problem. And within 30 minutes it was done. Once home I had it looked at by a luggage repair professional and he said that there was nothing more he could do. The repair done in Morocco was perfect.

The surroundings are traditionally Morrocan and very comfortable. One restaurant has an open patio surrounding a swimming pool, perfect for breakfast, lunch, aternoon tea (provided free) and dinner; while the Moroccan restaurant provides a more formal, traditional setting. The food in both is exquisite. Within walking distance of the Koutoubia mosque and main square, it is in an ideal position. The free shuttle to their country club gives the opportunity to relax by a large swimming pool, have lunch or drinks, again with superb service. Did not use the spa but it looked lovely.

Very peaceful after the chaotic pace of Marrakech.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 October 2011,5,What a great spot!,"We loved the staff and feel of this hotel! The welcome drink was a nice touch.

 April 2012,5,You must stay here!,"I have never written a review on any hotel I've stayed at, but I feel compelled to offer my feedback on La Maison Arabe. It is absolutely the ideal way to experience Moroccan culture but in a highly luxurious, pampered setting. The hotel and grounds are unique and beautiful. The amenities are consistent with any 5-star hotel. However, it was the service that ""got me at 'Hello'"". No question or request was considered too trivial; every staff member (in particular, the concierges) were extremely attentive, courteous, and friendly. Marrakech is an assault on one's senses and having a wonderful place to come back to in order to renew and refresh was essential, in our opinion.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech

The breakfast by the pool, among the best we know; dinner at the morocan restaurant, the best meal we have had in Morocco. Drinks at the jazz bar, just perfect, with the complicity of Rachid mixing non-alcohol cocktails for the childs.

The ambiance is restful. The staff are exceptional, from the reception desk onwards to every department in the hotel. My wife and I have just spent 7 nights there. Marrakech is quite a culture shock (in an enjoyable way!) and La Maison Arabe is an oasis in the madness of the city. Our room was excellent.

 April 2012,5,Great choice,"We hesitated between staying in a big hotel in the Palm Grove outside the city and a riad in the medina. It took forever to decide and since we were arriving by rental car finally chose La Maison Arabe as they provide free parking. What an amazing place! All the mystery and coziness we were expecting from a riad, plus the chance to be in the center of things – the medina is just crazy and bursting with energy – you really should be in the medina especially if like us it’s your first trip. But the big plus for us was the country property and swimming pool in the Palm Grove owned by La Maison Arabe which only hotel guests can use.

You're within walking distance of the main square and the nearby souks where I always end up spending too much money (not a good bargainer here). Since our last trip the hotel seems to have doubled in size and now has an on site pool. They still have their drop dead beautiful country property where we spent 2 relaxing afternoons.

The hotel is down a simple street, and I could not imagine from the unnoticeable and plain exterior walls what lay behind the front doors. Everything in the hotel, from my room (a suite called “Nar” with a private terrace overlooking the swimming pool) to the salons to the restaurants to the gorgeous bar is elegant in an understated way. The hotel is a bit difficult to navigate at first, with lots of intimate salons, but that led me to discover something new every day.

The service was always at the right level: friendly, professional, efficient, and attentive without being overwhelming.

I brought my daughter to this outstanding Riad for a convalescing holiday - strange choice to go to the bustling city of Marrakech some might think but.....La Maison Arabe has simply got it right. They understand how to provide an oasis of peace in an otherwise sometimes harsh and often too meaningless world. I think this must be the only hotel with a quiet and truly beautiful country club a mere 20mins away by complimentary transport. Ideal if you want to experience a taste of Arabia without the frenetic pace of the Medina.

But once inside it became obvious that the 26 bedroom hotel was very spacious indeed. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful whenever needed. The two restaurants, one serving Moroccan cuisine and the other a la carte and by the pool, were very good. The only criticism we could level would be that the menu did not change throughout the week and since we ate in every night we started to run out of new things to try.

The staff were incredibly welcoming -- to both us and our daughter -- and went out of their way to make our stay fabulous. (Our daughter has food allergies, and they even had special treats on hand for her when we arrived!)

The rugs, furniture and paintings that decorated the walls made me feel as if I had just walked into the finest home in Marrakesh. Their style was a blend of traditional Moroccan decor with a modern twist. Walking through the corridors that are nothing like your average hotel's boring hallways, I explored the many courtyards, tea room, jazz bar, pool, terrace, spa and cooking area- it was such a thrill!

Because I had unexpectedly sprained my ankle and walking was difficult and painful, we needed to find somewhere nearby for dinners. Who could have imagined we would stumble upon such a breathtaking oasis as the Maison Arabe. We were instantly treated with absolute friendliness and courtesy, and even though we never reserved, we had dinner there for the last 3 nights of our trip. We were expertly served with grace, elegance and humour by the wonderful Abdellah, and his colleagues. The candle-lit poolside setting was magical, and the food, of course, was exquisite. We enjoyed the lovely music of lute and guitar playing discreetly in the…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2012,5,An absolute gem,"We spent two nights at the Maison and it was fabulous. The staff are so attentive, our suite was beautiful with a balcony overlooking the courtyard and the food was gorgeous, with an egg and pancake station It is only a 10 minute walk from the souks and is just beautiful. There is a larger Poole off site which is beautiful but unheated- bit chilly in February. Overall- loved it,",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2012,4,Good hotel with excellent restaurant,"Good hotel, the new addition (new wing) is great. Rooms and service are perfect. However, be aware the pool although they say is heated is very cold in winter. Breakfast was average with limited choice of food (pancakes, eggs and french pastries). The moroccan restaurant is an institution and so are the cooking classes. Overall quite expensive and a little out of the way.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2012,5,an amaizing experience,"I stayed at la maison arabe, for three nights, I must say that being a frequent traveller, it´s not easy to surprise me, but la maison arabe did, the location, building, decoration, personnel and food were outstanding!",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 March 2011,5,Sumptuous luxury,"You don't need to leave this gorgeous riad. With a fabulous restaurant, friendly waitstaff, outdoor pool, flowered courtyards, hammam and cooking school all under the same roof, it's possible to be entertained here for days. The front desk was happy to arrange city tours for me and was kind and respectful of a solo traveler. Five stars.",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2012,5,Couldn't have chosen better,"We stayed for a week and were expertly looked after. The promised free upgrade happened when they moved us from a lovely room into an even more beautiful suite. Inside the hotel is gorgeous to look at, and scrupulously clean. Its levels of service included letting us know the Manchester United scores. (We are sure they would do the same for City fans.) The location within the city is excellent: we could easily walk out to all the major sites and restaurants. A very real bonus was the complementary trip out to the riad's private casbah with its gardens and large pool. Here the club sandwiches are extraordinarily good with fresh herb salads from the garden. We ate in the restaurant twice and its food is good and not that expensive. The only downside, and this is true of any hotel…",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
 February 2012,5,Should be in Top 5 hotel in Marrakesh,"La Maison Arabe for me is more than a Riad with just charms and few rooms, it's also not as a hotel with huge constructions . It's a good size where you feel you are like at home with nice decoration, good services, many facilities . The top for me is having fresh bread and Moroccan crepes made front of you every morning . The staff are adorable and are very helpful",La_Maison_Arabe,Marrakech
