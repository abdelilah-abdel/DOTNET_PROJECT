 December 2018,5,Wonderful place in Rabat,"After a great accommodation in Chefchaouen I went to Rabat knowing that the mark on booking.com was good but I didn't expect so much from the place I will review today. Riad Meftaha was carefully chosen after I studied many accommodation offers in Rabat. You see, I wanted something really close to the Medina and the important sights because I didn't wanted to take cabs or worse drive from one place to another. And after studying a bit I chose perfectly. The Riad is about 200 meters away from one of the gates to the old Medina. So it is really hard beating this in terms of proximity. Now I know what you're thinking. Being so close to the medina isn't it chaotic? Well it isn't. Because the Riad is part from a group of buildings pointing to a secondary street and not…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat

Located a close walk to just about anywhere you need to go (including the train station), but secluded enough to be quiet at night. Even the breakfast here is better than most riads we've stayed at elsewhere, allowing the convenience of self service so things don't go to waste.

Breakfast was great. It had fruits, pancake like Moroccan bread (which tasted delish with honey), jams, boiled eggs, lemonade, orange juice and Moroccan bread.

They also have umbrellas available at the entrance :) I would definitely recommend this place If you go to Rabat.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 October 2018,5,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed here one night- our last day of a 3 week trip in Morocco. This was a great riad with wonderful staff. Frank will provide a map and orient you.

 November 2018,5,Meftaha Ocean Apartment,"Riad Meftaha rents out a self contained apartment in the Océane district about a 10 minute walk from the Riad near the sea. We stayed there for two nights from 4-6 November and found it pretty, impeccably clean, comfortable and practical. It has been decorated in a modern style and everything is fresh and new and well thought out. There is a small, but functional kitchen with a dishwasher and even a washing machine and a clothes drying rack. It felt very homey to us. You really could spend a very comfortable week here recovering from a desert trek, or other voyage. It is set up for two to four people, but just one bedroom so best for a couple, or a couple with one or two children. We were welcomed warmly by Frank, Safiane, and Rajae at the Riad and all communication was simple…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat

 October 2018,5,A very pleasant surprise!,"Upon arrival in Casablanca, we decided to go direct to Rabat for an overnight stay. We booked one night in this riad based on the good reviews we had read.

 September 2018,5,Welcome to Morocco,We arrived in Morocco to spend our first night in the ultimate riad experience. The magnificent entrance opens to the warmest of welcomes and magical decor that draws your eye to every corner. We were able to stay in the terrace suite that had all tbe comforts of home. An evening on the roof terrace allowed us to enjoy the prayer calls from nearby mosques and tbe cool evening breeze. When you didn't think anything could get better you wake up to the best breakfast experience that was a taste sensation. We were sorry to leave but our Morrocan experience was waiting.,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 September 2018,5,"Great hotel, friendly staff",This Riad is located just 15 mintutea walk from the major tourist attractions (like the kasbah of the Udayas). There’s also a moroc telecom store (just ask the host) where you can get a SIM card and 2gb of data for only 40 dh (4.5usd). The Riad is beautiful and the hosts extremely accommodating. Our host gave us a map of Rabat and told us about the best ways to get around and what the typical touristy walk through Rabat would look like,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 August 2018,5,Hidden Gem in Rabat,"We flew into Casablanca from Sydney. The owner Franck was helpful and organised an airport taxi transfer for a small fee.

 July 2018,5,The best place I've seen in my Morocco trip,"The whole experience was perfect. Even if we got late, they waited for us til almost 10pm. The staff in general makes you feel at home. The Riad is so nice and the room was big and cosy. I also loved the bathroom and the style used in the room.

 July 2018,5,A Truly Wonderful Experience,"I don’t write reviews often; it’s probably a flaw in my character. I’m just lazy about it. However, my experience with Riad Meftaha was so incredibly positive that I MUST write to speak about it. When I arrived, the two young ladies who run the Riad were so helpful and kind. They do everything and anything to make your stay better. At one point, my friend and I were very tired and decided to order pizza(I know, really immersing ourself in the culture of Morocco) and when we asked Raja(one of the ladies) where we could order from, she took our money and went out and bought pizza and brought it to us in our room. This is just one example of the “over and above” attitude that these ladies have. They provide the best customer service I’ve ever seen. Secondly, the Riad is…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 June 2018,5,The best Riad in Rabat,The service and the attention of both receptionists Rajaa and Chaymae. The room and the breakfast were incredible too! The best Riad in Rabat ! Highly recommended !!! We recommend it to all our friends ! Thank you for everything !,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Indulge yourself in a real riad feeling,"This is possibly not an original dhar but it is well restyled. In fact this is a well-served (free bottle of water every day, tea service, skin cream Moroccan style and scents everywhere) nice atmosphere that brings you in a complete oriental mode and is good to spent your days in Rabat. Breakfast is abundant with lots of fresh things, actually it was the biggest variety we have had throughout Morocco during our holidays. We took the liberty of using their restaurant one night. It is around the corner and owned also by the same person. It is not so decorated and lacks a bit of atmosphere. But that is corrected by the nice service and the good food. They serve a daily menu, but they honour specific diet requests. Our room on the ground floor was spacious and attentively decorated…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 March 2018,5,"Modest riad, great location, lovely service","We found this a modest and very good value riad, in a very convenient location. It is just outside the medina, walking distance to the kasbah and coast, yet also only 20 minutes walk down to the train station and Ville Nouvelle (Rabat is not a very large city despite being the capital). Our stay of three nights, at the start of our two week holiday in Morocco, was made very enjoyable by the delightful service of the two ladies, Raja and Chaymae. Raja did her very best to welcome us, though spoke very little English, and used a voice translation app on her phone. It would have been good to have been given more information and guidance, and it was unfortunate that we did not meet the owner Franck at all. Our ground floor room was comfortable, the kettle and tea provided was much…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Lovely and unforgettable stay,"My family stayed in this Riad for 1 night. The manager named Shama (sp?) greeted us with warm and kind smile. Although she only started working there for 6 months, she was so very knowledgeable and helpful that she answered all our questions about Rabat. There were 2 other ladies who work there as both cooks and cleaners. During dinner, one of them served us food first since she knew that our boy might be hungry although there was a big group of adults sitting ahead of us. Another lady named Raja (sp?) gave my boy 2 lollipops before leaving. They were all very thoughtful, considerate and kind. Thank you, Ladies. You had made our trip memorable in Morocco. I highly recommend whoever visit Rabat to stay in this riad. D",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat

 April 2018,5,3 Nights of Wonderful Moroccan Hospitality,"We arrived super late because of cancelled flights and were warmly, warmly welcomed. We had a unique tiled room with a super comfy big bed and a strong hot ultra-modern shower. (Looks like a space pod out of Star Trek!) Every corner of the Riad is beautifully decorated and soft Moroccan music is played in the common areas. Breakfast is included and generous with a changing variety of fresh local breads with jams and honey, fruit (fresh & dried), hard boiled egg, yogurt, fresh squeezed juice, strong coffee, and mint tea. All served with a smile. More than enough to get you going. The STAFF (all female the days we were there) were kind, hospitable, eager to help organize outings or call a taxi for you.

Tea at anytime of day. Sitting area in lobby or rooftop,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 March 2018,5,Fabulous!,"We had the pleasure of staying in this charming Riad for 6 nights. The location was perfect, in a quiet neighbourhood with wonderful access to the tram and two excellent restaurants: Dar Nani and Yamel Alchem. Our room was carefully thought out with a very comfortable bed and a ultra modern shower but what we really enjoyed was interacting with the staff. A special thank you to Raja for sharing her recipe of baghrir.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 January 2018,5,Love at first sight!,"This hotel is amazing. From outside you might wonder how f you made the best choice but once you walk inside you won't believe it. It is like one of the 1000 nights take!! The lounge is the dinner and breakfast room, Let's say the patio of the house. The room was super clean, big and beautiful. The bed was comfy, we had a good rest. There is a small TV (just the right size as you are not here to watch TV), a small safe, some gear for tea. The bathroom is awesome. That shower will stay in my memory. It is all the right combination between local style and luxury. They provide shampoo and shower gel. Staff is supper friendly. WiFi good but in some places the signal was weak. Breakfast is a nice combination of local tastes.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 January 2018,5,Amazing,"Lovely staff, friendly, helpful and great environment. Very central. Advisable 100%. Only negative issue is the poor English they speak but they manage to be understood and to understand you. The room was amazing with terrace and very clean and tidy",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 December 2017,4,"Great Riad, Avoid Annex Restaurant","We stayed for 2 nights at this excellent Riad - people were friendly, breakfast was plentiful but not to everyone's taste, the rooms were clean. The main concern, which is keeping them from getting 5 stars, was the sister restaurant - advertised in the room and in the lobby of the Riad. They serve only people staying at the Riad (or perhaps who know about the place) and only a few doors down and a few dors to the left. We were told they have a set menu, and serve from 7:30 till 10:00? or so. We booked 7:30 as we'd just arrived that day and wanted an early dinner and bed.

 December 2017,4,Clean and new stay in rabat,"Very neat and clean, the attendant was very nice and helpful. The location is great next to the Medina and the market. The hotel has clean rooms and a great breakfast with self-service, but we were in a room next to reception and common area from where we heard everything. The restaurant of the hotel was nice and we had a good couscous. However it didn't have much choice other than the daily menu.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 November 2017,5,Excellent Stay,"We were very pleased with our 1-night stay at Riad Meftaha. Pros: - Great location: Within walking distance to the major landmarks in Rabat. Under 10 min blue taxi ride to train station (metered price: 7.5 DH, or Uber ~15 DH). Hotel informed me that blue taxi can cost maximum price of 50 dirhams/$5.32 USD or come on foot (it takes about 12 minutes). We recommend Uber or metered taxi, which came out much lower than 50 dirhams. - Very helpful and friendly manager / front desk lady who spoke great English. She walked us through our afternoon itinerary, gave us restaurant recommendations, and when I asked about train schedules to Fes, she printed quickly printed out the schedule for me. - The Riad is beautiful, ornate, clean, and quiet. Our double room ($78.21/night with bfast…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 November 2017,5,Very nice and cozy Riad,"This Riad was very nice and very clean. The hosts were kind and welcoming. The breakfast was delicious.

 October 2017,4,Nice riad with lovely staff,"+: very pretty riad, with big rooms. Although we were on the ground floor next to the breakfast, it was very quiet. The staff was very welcoming and extremely nice. You can park right outside the hotel, a guard looks after your car. All in all, very good value for money. -: can’t think of any in fact.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Really nice Riad in Rabat.,"This Riad is at the edge of the Medina, a few blocks away, and a taxi can take you to its front door. As with every Riad we stayed in, you just can't tell what is inside the large door that opens to the interior - but we were always pleasantly surprised. Riad Meftaha is a delightful Riad at the corner of Rue Pakistan and Rue Iran (for some reason, that amused me) Once inside, you enter a large open courtyard, beautifully decorated with couches,tables and chairs. Our hostess brought us tea and cookies while we signed in, and showed us where various sights were on the map. Our room, on the second floor was colorful, tastefully decorated and spacious enough for the two of us. The wi fi was good. Our room opened onto the corridor, but we were at one end, and had a nice little couch…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat

 September 2017,5,Beautifully decorated riad,"We loved this Riad! It is beautifully decorated and it seemed recently renovated. It is located very centrally, just a few minutes walking distance from the medina. The owners are very nice and the breakfast was delicious and elaborate. We had a room at the courtyard and we can imagine that it might be a bit noisy, bur in our case everyone was very silent until 9.00 in the morning so that was great! I really cannot think of anything they need to improve, so I gave them 5/5!",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 July 2017,5,Beautiful Raid well decorated,"We stayed in the Riad from the 23-27.07 and we really enjoyed. We had our 3 teenager children, and it was wonderful. The Riad is very clean and beautiful. Rooms are spacious and well decorated. Breakfast very good and special thanks to Khadija, she really made our stay very welcoming and enjoyable. Khadija well done and hope to see you soon. This won't be our last. I will really recommend the Riad",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat

 July 2017,5,Highly recommended,We service very tired travelling for a a few days from Spain. The manager offered us some motto on tea and explain us absolutely everything we need to know about rabat and the hotel. The breakfast is very good and and the rooms clean and comfortable. Love that jacuzzi in our room. The last day we were leaving at 6.30am and the managers make a breakfast to take away for us. She is great!!,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 July 2017,5,A haven in Rabat!,"From the very warm welcome upon arrival to relaxation on the upper terrace to the elegantly decorated room to the fantastic service at breakfast, this was an amazing place with great service. Our room, with 2 queen beds, was clean and comfortable, with A/C and a large bathroom. The hotel is located in a very unique building that has the appearance of a small royal residence. The location is walking distance to the ocean and the markets in the medina of the old city. The Andalusian garden is near as well. Great stay!",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 June 2017,5,Simply perfect,"This is probably one of the best accommodations I've ever stayed at. The staff is amazing: Khadija (so sweet and polite), Samira (helpful and attentive), Frank, the owner (always smiling and welcoming)...and so much more! The location is perfect to visit the whole city: close to the medina and far enough from its noise and crowd, you can reach all the main landmarks in a few minutes. Breakfast is huge and the quality is excellent; the room we were given was comfortable (my girlfriend and I loved the jacuzzi) and bigger than expected. What else can be said? We'll miss the people there, we'll miss the Riad Meftaha and we hope to return there soon.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 June 2017,5,Very good,"Very nice and comfortable riad, the room was spacious and very clean , with any comfort (air con, kettle, tea bags, big shower, huge bathroom, tv).

 May 2017,5,Again a surprise at the end of the lane,This Riad is very well located with good restaurants within 10 minutes walking distance. The lady in charge showed us on their map where these restaurants were located. We had a very nice room with modern shower. The TV does have international channels. There is no aircon in our room but a very quiet pedestal fan. The Riad is in a quiet area and there is a roof top area to relax at.,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 January 2017,5,Amazing stay!,"We traveled as a family of 2+2 and had a spacious, sooooo beautifully decorated two room suite for us. There was a nice little rooftop patio too. This was the most 'expensive' hotel we had during our 1-week long trip in Morocco but truly worth every penny. The owner with his staff were so welcoming from the moment we knocked on their door. They took care of parking our car and offered local mint tea with yummy biscuits on the side, Breakfast was very delicious too. Location very close to old town Rabat and seaside. You can walk to all major sight of the city from here. We hope to return some day and only regret is we didn't stay longer.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 April 2017,5,Wonderful stay at Riad Mefteha,"A friend and I booked separate rooms at the Riad for two nights at the beginning of April. What a wonderful stay it was. We had both rooms on the ground floor. I loved the R'abat room that I stayed in. Spacious and comfortable. Lovely shower. Appreciated the hair dryer as it worked much faster than the travel one I carried along. Check-in and check-out were easy. Loved the welcome tea and cookies. Breakfast was ample with yoghurt, eggs, bread, cheese fruit, juice, tea/coffee and bottled water provided. The location is great, easy walk to the medina and walking distance to all the major sights. Lovely roof terrace to chill in the evenings or late afternoons. The real gem of this riad is Khadija. What a warm and wonderful hostess. Thank you Khadija. We appreciated all the…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 March 2017,5,Highlight of a 5 week trip to Morocco!,"Located within the medina but tucked away down a few corners, this is a jewel. It only has a few rooms which makes it very much like staying with a family. We arrived early but were heartily welcomed with mint tea and cookies. Our room was gorgeous with fabrics, tiles, cushions. Breakfast was lovely, the hostess was helpful and gracious, even loaned us an umbrella. They had a TV in one corner that had documentaries on how Moroccan craftsmen make the incredibly detailed ceramics, tiles, wood carvings, etc. Such a wonderful explanation of Morocco! This was at the beginning of our trip; we traveled all around Morocco and stayed in amazing places, but this was our favorite.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 March 2017,5,Morocco- amazing,Our first two nights in Morocco were spent here. The room was spacious and tastefully appointed - loved the rugs and wall décor. Breakfast and dinner were delicious. The staff was pleasant and willing to please.,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat

 April 2016,5,A great place to stay like a queen,"I liked everything about the riad. The interior was excellent and Shakira, the staff at the riad, was very friendly and cooperative. The room was spick-and-span, the bed was neatly done. The interior of the riad was just too good. And of course, the breakfast was heavy and delicious and mouthwatering. Loved it. The small terrace on the roof top was really cozy and refreshing. If I travel to Rabat again then Meftaha will definitely be in my priority list for my accommodation. All the best for Riad Meftaha.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 March 2017,5,High level hospitality,"We stayed in Riad Meftaha twice for 1 night. It's a marvellous place. The hotel is situated nearby the old city center in a old, renewed upper class house. All is taken care of to make your stay a dream. The rooms are big, tidy and offer any comfort necessary. The mattresses on the beds are really good. You can relax in the hall or on the terrace. And despite the central location, nothing is heard from what's happening outside. But the real jewel on the crown is the hostess. She's so friendly, willing to help, giving advice on any question or request you might have. A plus for us was the man who was watching our car on the street. Makes one feel (even more) comfortable. And all of this is offered for a very reasonable price. Briefly, this is a center of excellence!",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 February 2017,5,a gem - hard to recommend it highly enough,"the riad is 10 minute walk fron the medina and numerous good restaurants. the hosts were friendly and personable. our room was spacious and well appointed. the shower deserves a special mention with the choice of overhead, handheld or body jets. breakfast was a great selection of breads, pasteries, fruit, olives, figs, eggs and more. The eating area has a 6 m high ceiling and is open to the atrium/courtyard. a wonderful space to begin the day. riad decor is beautiful. fully agree with all the positive reviews of this place. do yourself a favour and stay here",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 December 2016,5,Stunning riad!,"One of the most beautiful riads we have stayed in! The decor in the common area is just stunning! Beautiful, spacious and comfortable rooms with soaps, creams, tea, etc. Lots of little touches to make it special. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was a feast with the best coffee! Great location walking distance from the old medina and other attractions. A wonderful stay!",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 December 2016,5,An amazing stay,"We only spent one day in Rabat, but found a gem of a place to stay. It's location is perfect as you are around the Old Medina and the main sights are in walking distance. On our arrival we were welcomed and immediately felt at home. It was a wow moment as we entered the room. Beautiful Moroccan decor in a tasteful design. We completed out form, left our bags and with a provided map left to explore Seven hours later on our return we found our bags in our room and saw our stunning accommodation for the first time. We were blown away at the small touches our room had. A shower with good strong pressure and hot too. A massive bathroom with soaps, shampoo and all. The bed was most comfortable and a good nights sleep was enjoyed. I can only compliment the staff and thank them for…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 December 2016,5,Amazing place,"Our favorite place in Morocco after staying in several cities. Room and common areas were meticulous and gorgeous - the staff had amazing attention to every detail. They offered an experience at the hammam nearby which was incredible, far better than one I had in Fes for the same price. The breakfast was awesome - lots of different things to try, all beautifully presented, including great coffee. They also had excellent internet, where I was able to work for a few hours with no problems at all. If you have the opportunity I definitely recommend staying here.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 November 2016,5,Excellent Service,"Been traveling through Morocco and we got to Rabat tired and the staff were wonderful. The riad is beautiful and the service is first class. Loved Abir she is simply the best. Would definitely visit again.

 November 2016,5,Our best accomodation in Morocco,"Excellent location, just steps from the old Medina, sea side and Kasbah. Beautiful décor, friendly and helpful staff, delicious coffee and ample breakfast. The best shower we had in Morocco! They even supply us with black soap - try it - amazing for your skin. Parking is public, on the street but very safe as the street is very quiet.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 October 2016,5,The best riad I have stayed in Morocco,"I traveled morocco for 3 weeks by driving car. this was the best riad I have stayed in Morocco. It is Located just near the medina and easy to find. Host and staff were very kind and helpful. Inside decoration of the riad was really beautiful. 10-15 minutes walk to Hassan Tower and old medina is just nearby. Roof top terrace was nice and I drank Moroccan wine there. Room is very clean and comfortable, bath room also nice. Nothing to complain!!! Breakfast also delicius and nice. If I revisit Rabat, I will choose Riad Meftaha again. Parking is available just in front of the riad. Very nice place to stay with reasonable price. Really clean and comfortable",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Best riad,"This riad was the absolute best place we have stayed in during our 3 week trip to morocco. We stayed only one night en route to our flight home, but wished it was longer. The room and common areas are beautifully decorated and spotless. The shower was the best of our trip. Franck and his staff were very attentive and helpful. The rooftop terrace was inviting and relaxing. Location couldn't have been better.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Excellent first night stop over,"We stayed here after landing in the evening at Rabat airport. The owners had arranged for a taxi to pick us up, the driver was there waiting for us on arrival and delivered us to the Riad. I do think we would have been looking for the Riad all night without that taxi driver! On arrival we were not disappointed. Greeted with a cup of coffee and shown to our beautifully appointed room - just what we needed after travelling all day. We only stayed for one night and had the same taxi driver pick us up the next morning, after a delicious breakfast, and take us to pick up our hire car. We would have happily stayed longer had we had time.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 January 2016,5,lovely fairy-tailish place,"completely new furnished place with very welcoming owner, franck. due to our cancelled flight we came late, in the mignight, but franck was very nice anyway. the rooms were beautiful, completely clean and the breakfast was absolutely delicious, actually one of the meals we have had in morocco. it's located in a quiet area of rabat with a possibility to park right in front of the riad.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 June 2016,5,Beautiful but modern riad outside medina and near the sea!,"Very cute riad by the medina, on a quiet side street. Super friendly and attentive staff, amazing breakfast!!

 June 2016,5,Nothing to much trouble and central to attractions,"One of my favourite places that I stayed on my whole trip of 7 weeks in Morocco.

The other great thing we discovered is that the riad is walking distance to all the attractions we wanted to see.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 August 2016,5,Lovely,Super cute new Riad right outside the Medina. Our double room was on the ground level and had everything we needed until the last detail. The hosts were very welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. Highly recommended for both couples and families.,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 August 2016,5,One of the best!,The Riad is located just side to the medina in a very quiet and accessible street. By foot you can reach the center of the medina in 10m. This is not an historical Riad but the staff are amazingly helpful and friendly. Breakfast is diverse and very good quality.,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 July 2016,5,Wish we stayed longer...,"Unfortunately we only stayed for 1 night, but what an outstanding place Riad Meftaha is. The riad is decorated in splendid Moroccan style with attention to every small detail. Breakfast area is gorgeous; there is also a small lounge area with games and TV. We stayed in a fantastic family room full of character, that even had a jacuzzi. Very friendly staff and delicious breakfast, going from boiled eggs to fresh cherries. Location is very quiet but just near the medina walls. Wish we stayed longer...",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 July 2016,5,The best!,"We loved our stay here. The staff were very friendly and welcoming but didn't smother us or try to upswell anything. The breakfast was outstanding!! Fruit, boiled eggs, yoghurt, espresso machine coffee, bread and jams - a real feast. The rooms were large and decorated really beautifully. The terrace upstairs was great and had day beds and shade. The location is great- just outside the medina wall and within walking distance to most things. Only thing was the bed was very hard, but it seems most beds are in Morocco. Thanks for having us!",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 July 2016,5,A+,"This place is fantastic! Located just outside of the medina and easy walking distance to the shopping area and the water. This Riad was fairly large and the rooms were also large with high ceilings. The rooms was fantastically decorated and the shower was the best I have experienced since leaving home many weeks ago!!

 June 2016,5,Amazing!,"I highly recommend staying at this beautiful riad in Rabat. An ideal location with the beach, kasbah and medina all within walking distance. A traditional riad with beautiful interior design, great to relax on the rooftop during a hot day.

Through the old wooden door into a beautiful courtyard with very attentive hosts. They brought us snacks and drinks while our room was being cleaned. Very nicely decorated in Moroccan style. Our room(s) for 5 were quite large and clean. The bath was large and had a large spa tub. Room is air conditioned. The breakfast had a wide variety of breads, fruits, pastries, yoghurt, eggs, juice, coffee or tea. The riad is a short walk from the Medina, where we spent an afternoon wandering and looking and buying. It is also not far from the Casbah and the beach. The roof terrace available for relaxing with deck chairs, hammock, and a tent of brocade with low couches. We were extremely pleased with the value…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 March 2016,5,Excellent value,We travelled with adult daughter and partner. We had a shared room with solid walls that did not reach the ceiling. So some privacy but still intimate.

 April 2016,5,Great place to stay,"Stayed here with the family for three nights. Staff are very helpful and friendly.

There's a big courtyard decorated in Moroccan style. Couldn't recommend it more.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 March 2016,4,Good night's sleep in Rabat,"Very pretty riad, with modern furnishings, fixtures and fittings, lovely bedding, we all got a great night's sleep. We also enjoyed the jacuzzi. Hosts had thoughtfully provided a selection of games and books, including children's, in both the room and in the communal area below. The riad is well placed for both the medina and the kasbah. The roof terrace is lovely. We ran out of hot water though!",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 January 2016,5,Wonderful location/Great management,"We stayed two days in Rabat in a trip through Morrocco. The Riad is easy to locate, off the Main Street, yet a great location immediately at the main gate to the Kasbah, the Medina and numerous restaurants and local businesses. The owner, Franck, was very helpful with information directions and the staff were friendly. We were late finding a taxi to the airport. Franck got his vehicle and drove us to the terminal in his car. We just made our flight. I cannot recommend this Riad more highly. We felt like very welcome guests. Great experience. Nice furnishings. Good food and wine.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 January 2016,5,Visit,This was a beautiful riad and we loved our stay. We had a very large suite for our family of 4. Very nice and helpful host.

 January 2016,5,Wonderful stay,"A quiet and clean riad close to the medina and the ocean. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are as nicely decorated as the riad itself and most importantly, the beds are super comfortable. Very fair price.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 December 2015,5,A beautiful Riad,"This riad is hiding inside the road, very easy to be ignored. I've stayed just for one night, but it was very clean, quiet and stylish. The staffs are friendly and helpful. The breakfast is also yummy! There are many restaurants, pubs here, and just 5-10 mins walk you can reach La kasbah des oudaias. I'm satisfied with my stay.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 December 2015,3,"Lovely to the eye, but management needs to attend to practical issues","The location of Riad Meftaha is an asset if you have good legs. 200m away is a gateway into the old walled city (medina) though you'll still need to walk another 500m to reach the more bustling part. The hotel is also within walking distance of a Tramway stop (Bab al-Had). Returning by tram from a day out and getting off at this Tramway stop had one advantage: there is a Carrefour Supermarket near it so I could stock up whatever provisions I needed for my room. The hotel is beautifully done up at least in the common areas. The room however is distinctly plainer, though still pleasing to the eye. However, because of the hard surfaces so typical of Moroccan architecture, even the slightest noise reverberates through the central hall. I reckon those with rooms facing the hall…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 December 2015,4,Very nice and quiet riad,"They just finish to revenue this place, everything is very nice and stilish. Big room, clean and very comfortable bed. Very good breakfast, just 5 min walk from Medina and from the Ocean. I suggest it to everyone",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Beautiful riad with great service and food,"Our flight arrived in Rabat early evening so when the riad offered us a 3-course menu we did not hesitate to accept that. We were not disappointed. We were welcomed by the owner. He also served that food that tasted really good. Authentic Moroccan flavours, we really liked it. He told us that all ingredients were bought at the nearby food market, so everything was really fresh. Breakfast the next morning was just as outstanding. Our room was comfortable with a great shower. Rabat's medina is just around the corner, whereas we could park our rental car in the street.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Great location and staffs,"Friendly staff. They welcomed us with lots of smiles. The room was perfect. Beautiful, spacious and clean. The location of the hotel was great. Near to the market. Nothing much in Rabat though. But we still live Morocco.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 September 2015,4,Quite a surprise,It's a well hidden hotel near the medina. Loved the tea when we arrived and the terrace for relaxing. Very leasent space.

Only problem was we were charged VAT twice and the owner couldn't (didn't want?) to understand...,Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Not what you expect from the street outside!,"Really surprised and delighted by this Hotel (Riad). Franck (French) and his wife (Moroccan, sorry can't recall her name) were so friendly and nothing was to much trouble. We went to Rabat on our way to Casablanca for a family wedding. Flew into Rabat because it was the cheaper option and was looking for one night's accommodation. I was really pleased to have picked a little gem in Riad Meftaha. Communication with Franck ahead of our visit had been excellent and we had arranged to have a meal when we arrived. His wife had made a traditional Moroccan meal which whilst unusual (mixture of sweet and savoury in the main dish) was very tasty. Franck has been decorating the Riad since he took it over in January 2015 and he has done a great job. All the rooms were different and very…",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
 August 2015,5,Perfect first night in Morocco,"Franck (the owner) is a very friendly guy and did all he could to make our stay perfect (including picking us up from a place close by since our taxi driver could not find the place). The hotel is brand new, stylist and the breakfast is nice. Room was large and the bed was very comfortable. Bathroom very clean and shower was good and warm. It is walking distance from the Medina and you can get the subway in a station close by to go to the mausoleum and train station.",Riad_Meftaha,Rabat
