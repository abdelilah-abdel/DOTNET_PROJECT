 September 2022,4,Boutique hotel lovely location,"A very elegant hotel with lovely decor. Boutique hotel with nice view of the sea. Though not all rooms get a good view. Rooms are small, about 14 by 14 ft, but comfortable. Decent sized bathroom. The rare hotel which has place to put up 2 large bags, though the bag rack takes up space in front of the cupboards. There is no coffee or tea making facilities in the room and the wifi didn't work while we were there. They did not have drinking glasses in the room. But if you can live without the above, then a lovely place to stay. It has a nice terrace on the ground floor.

 November 2022,5,Super hotel,An historic building .. clean and spacious rooms. Ours had a view over the garden terrace. All the people working in the hotel were helpful and friendly .. a lovely lady who was cleaning suggested I use the service lift rather than wait for the other lift. Very kind although I ended up in the kitchen 😬 We asked to see the room Matisse painted from .. number 35. You can stay in the room too I think. A lovely gift for Art lovers. Easy to get around from here too. The hotel in on an incline so there are steep slopes and steps to access reception. We arrived very early on the overnight sleeper from Marrakech and they happily let us check in early. Thoroughly enjoyed our overnight stay and breakfast was super .. lots of beautifully prepared fresh fruit.

 October 2022,4,"Great Location, Comfortable","This vintage hotel is ideally located on the periphery of the old medina and near the Port. It’s been well -maintained and offers terrace views, piano bar, breakfast room and on-site restaurant. Rooms are comfy but not what you would considered modernized. The breakfast has ample choice but the service was slow. There were a couple of issues with the front desk, and the staff doesn’t appear to be coordinated.

My room was large and overlooked the sea. Service was excellent at the front desk and in the bar. the location is super, being just on the edge of the medina and a few blocks from the center of the new city. I only had breakfast and it was very nice: lots of fresh fruit and cheese and meats. French pastries. Excellent coffee. The desk man is very helpful and engaged a guide for me so I could have a fast tour of the medina and the outskirts of town.

 February 2020,5,Seeing Matisse’s bedroom was amazing,"How I wanted to see the room where Matisse had painted Window at Tangier so we went up the steps of The Grand, fully expecting it to be occupied. Instead a charming young man took us up to the second floor and unlocked room 35 with the original key. From the window you can look down on St Andrews church, over the bay and across to the mosque on the far hillside. Exactly as Matisse had painted it over 100 years ago. Except the trees have grown to hide the church. The original painting no doubt worth millions is in Russia but a copy with its bright blue edges hangs over the rather small and hard looking bed. From the other window more views of Matisse’s work. Best part of my holiday in Tangier.

Then we asked for a change of rooms, that as granted by the very nice man in the reception. The new room same part of the hotel had no smell, but mini-refrigerator was leaking water, we called, they cleaned it and next morning another pool of water, we did not care just for one night.

At the conclusion of our tour we made a payment to the tour guide of EUR 42 to cover the tour, tip, and taxi fare. A day later we were hostilly approached by the bellman OF THE HOTEL saying we never paid the taxi - even though it was made clear that it was included in our tour payment!

He did show me another room but it was small and had twin beds. As I’d pre paid through hotels.com I couldn’t move hotels. Finally he showed me another duplex room, which didn’t smell a lot. The bathroom was tiny and the furniture old and hard to sit on. Being right by the pool it was noisy from children playing.

The room was small but well set out. The main reason for giving this hotel such a poor rating was the rude staff especially the waiting staff. The man attending to the tables from the outset was rude and not willing to listen to what was being asked of the clients. A glass of wine for 5€ should be a full glass not a half glass. I hope the staff in the future are better trained as the hotel has a great history but will be lost quickly with its current staffing and management.

The staff is really nice and helpful, and they all spoke English (which I needed)—and also Arabic, Spanish, and French. The room was spacious, comfortable, and really beautifully designed. I had a wonderful view of the courtyard below (a great place for drinks or a meal if it's not too windy), and it was nice and quiet.

One cautionary note, if you want a guided tour of the city don’t go through the hotel. Having only one full day in Tangier we had the hotel arrange a driving tour with an English speaking driver.

The hotel staff were really helpful with our questions. We changed our money at the hotel and rate was reasonable. The facilities were nice. The room was very spacious and soundproof (though you will hear the call to prayer).

The hallway to our room was carpeted but was covered with loose dirt, lint, and who knows what else. It didn't look to have been vacuumed in weeks or longer. Upon entering our room we were overwhelmed by the smell of sewage. We traced the source to the shower drain so we used the bath mat to cover the drain for the duration of our stay.

Music is played there during dinner hour which runs to about 11 PM. I had dinner in the dining room and it was quite nice. Breakfast is served in another room and food selection was good.

Well situated in a lovely park setting, the recently renovated hotel is on the boundary between modern and traditional Tangier. The staff is helpful and friendly, breakfast is varied and plentiful, the Moroccan dinner is a treat. Ask for a sea view room and ask to visit room 35 where Henri Matisse painted his masterpieces of Saint Andrew church (currently in the Pushkin museum in Moscow) and Tangier life.

This man was trying to get every penny he could squeeze out of us. He was constantly asking us where we want to go. If it was a bite to eat he would tell us a person will show you where to go for a couple of Euros. The bank, again a person would show us for a couple of Euros. When we first arrived he wrote down two places to eat, you guessed it, someone can show you for a couple of Euros.

We deliberately chose an authentic hotel versus international chain hotel, and authentic it was: on top of a hill overlooking the Socco Grande, built around a central blue-tiled courtyard, an old-time beautiful dining room with sparkling chandeliers, artfully carved room doors & ceilings. The food is superb (think lambTajine!!!), the breakfast buffet plenty, varied and fresh and not to forget: the ever-served mint tea.

The hotel surpassed our expectations in every way. The elegant, tasteful decor, spacious comfortable rooms, manicured gardens and spectacular view from the terrace made our first night in Morocco very memorable. We had a delicious dinner watching the sun set across the misty ocean in the distance, listening to the call to prayer, then later…",Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2018,5,What a view!,Visited Tangier with family/friends and stayed at the Grand Hotel. It is beautiful and the view from our room was stunning!!

Would definitely stay here again!!!,Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2018,2,Lots of potential!!,Location is good and close to the medina and souks. That said. The medina and souks actually seemed dangerous and we left both times due to feeling unsafe. The hotel was lovely inside but the restaurant menu was limited and stupid expensive £4 for a bottle of water!! The staff were a 50/50 mix of either very helpful or completely indifferent. Wouldn’t stay there again or Tangier.

 May 2018,5,We Could Have Stayed Longer,"The hotel has the 18th century charm befitting its date of construction and historic importance - Matisse not only stayed here, but also created a fine painting while here. The location of the hotel is significant, close to the medina. In a way, you have to earn your stay, walking up a serious hill to the building. We were safe here, not only in feeling but also in reality. Now for the review. The Villa de France is truly old world style with gorgeous grounds, hand painted tiles and a fountain in courtyard. There was an unusual room number system, get over it. The room was a fine size and the bed comfortable. The attractive bathroom had a large bathtub and separate shower. We had a beautiful views from our room of the water.

 May 2018,4,Colonial style Hotel,A nice Hotel on the edge of the Medina. Room spacious and clean with an old world touch. Great view over the bay. Comfortable bed and bathroom with good water pressure. Breakfast adequate. Had a couple of drinks in the bar area with very friendly staff looking after a group of us.

 May 2018,4,"Beautiful Grounds, But Rooms A Little Dark","This hotel has heaps of potential given the beautifully landscaped grounds and views overlooking the Medina. Unfortunately we felt the the room itself was a little too dark (lacked enough natural light). As we were with a group, breakfast was available a little earlier for us (thank you for this), but unfortunately most of the food that was intended to be hot was cold.",Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 April 2018,4,Old-school hotel near the medina,"Once grand, if now slightly faded, colonial-style hotel on the edge of the medina in Tangier. Layout is quite labyrinthine -- getting from the lobby to our room was something of an adventure, but the room itself (superior double) was clean and fairly spacious. Service had its quirks -- extra water requested was never delivered and attempts to access the bottles in our minibar were complicated by the fact that access to it actually required a gentleman to come to the room to open it with his (the only?) key. Excellent (included) breakfast buffet. Overall, a good choice in Tangier for a traditional hotel -- as opposed to a riad -- especially for its proximity to the medina (5 min walk to gate at Place du 9 Avril 1947).",Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The staff are excellent and it was really convenient to have the onsite parking as we had our car. The hotel itself is charming- our room was huge with a great view. Excellent water pressure, very comfy bed. The pool area is really relaxing and lunch outside on the terrace is pricey but delicious. Breakfast was a bit picked over by the time we got there and the room it was in was a bit tired but the helpful staff were on hand for made to order eggs and Moroccan tea.

 April 2018,5,amazingly beautiful and comfortable,This was one of the best stays of our escorted tour. The hotel was very secure and safe.

 April 2018,3,Room with a view but no room to move!!,Room is up a steep incline to begin with so keep that in mind if you are moving your own luggage. Very odd and confusing room set up as well. I’m not quite sure why people like these very old hotels and how they ever get the ratings they give them. Room and bathroom are very small although had quality linens and towels. Headboard at bed and border around room was interesting. Pressure in shower was very good but when water hit the door enclosure it sounded like drilling. On a tour and a dinner was included which was good but small portions and not enough wait staff for group size. Couldn’t change a 100€ into smaller bills!!,Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2018,5,Fantastic hotel in great location,"We stayed 3 nights and had a very comfortable, large room with a great view over the medina to the sea, similar to the view Matisse had when he stayed here. The hotel has recently been refurbished in a grand old style. The bathroom was very elegant in marble. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The swimming pool looked great, but the weather was cool when we were there, so we didn't go in. Breakfast had a good selection of cheese, cold cuts, fruit and pastry. The location is excellent, between the medina and the new town. Very close to the best fish restaurant - Le Saveur de Poisson. Also close to a very good patisserie - Al Andalus.

 April 2018,4,Some where a little different,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a Insight group and have to say it is quite quaint as it has an old world charm about it. The rooms are very comfortable and quite large, well appointed and clean. The food we had was quite enjoyable with quite an extensive wine list at reasonable prices. Breakfast is to come tomorrow but by going with the standard I am sure it will be up to scratch. The staff were attentive and very helpful and spoke English.

 March 2018,5,Old world charm and an unbeatable location,"This neat hotel is a little Wes Anderson and a little Stanley Kubrik. Long hallways and old highly-polished bars, like in The Shining and formal, uniformed bellhops and special rooms and gardens, like any number of Anderson movies. Not creepy in the least though. Unlike some of the other reviews, we found service to be great. High water pressure and fast wifi. The views are to die for and the grounds are lovely. It really does have the charm of the past century. Evening turn down service, a classic piano bar (not cheesy like another reviewer stated), and prompt doormen. Here's the biggest win: We used a rewards booking system, which allowed us to book a room at El Minzah!

 March 2018,5,Elegant and historic,Unequalled location with iconic views of the harbor and to Spain from either your room or the terrace.

 March 2018,4,Nice hotel with great location but not 5-star,"This is really a nice hotel with lots of charm, centrally located in the heart of Tangier. We stayed here for 3 nights for my partner’s birthday and got a spacious Junior Suite. It was very quiet with a comfortable bed but with somewhat dated decor. The breakfast was generous and we had a great lunch one of the days in the beautiful Delacroix restaurant where the waiter was very friendly and the food was delicious. We also enjoyed the corny piano bar with a fun waiter! What wasn’t super great with our stay, and why this is not a 5-star hotel, was the service level and attitude from the front desk. When we asked them for an umbrella when it was raining they said they had given them away to the guests. (I don’t know what we were?)

 February 2018,4,Historic But Updated,"The Grand Hotel Villa de France is located just outside the Medina, so it’s well located for easily exploring the Medina (aka: market) and Kasbah (aka: fort). It is one of the historic Tangier hotels, but has been completely renovated with all the modern amenities; although they could probably use a soft goods upgrade at this point. It is also the sister hotel to El Minzah, which is around the corner. On check-in, we were upgraded to a larger suite overlooking the Bay of Tangier; probably because February is the low season and they had availability. The staff was lovely and could not be more helpful. While we had pre-arranged our city tour (read review of Aziz Benami), the hotel could arrange a tour as well.

The breakfast was nicely laid out and quite delicious. Finally, I had a chance to enjoy a fantastic New Year's Eve dinner in the main dining room.

I had a room with a wonderful huge window right above the bathtub, and really enjoyed my bath with the window open (the tub was low enough to give me privacy.) Spend a fine night here and would have stayed longer, but they were booked. From here, I went to the Hotel Fredj just up the street, which lacks the charm and history of Villa de France, but offers much more spacious rooms with big patios and better views - so that's the tradeoff!

 October 2017,4,Pleasant hotel with old world charm,"I chose to stay in Grand Hotel Villa de France because it is not an international hotel chain member. The plus side for being this is it keeps its grand villa charm from the old colonial days. The minus side, of course, is the hotel is quite dated. I booked into superior room with seaview. Through the clouds, Spain was visible on the other side of the Gibraltar Strait. The room is on two floors, with the downstairs sitting room directly facing the swimming pool, with a little outdoor fenced sitting area. The room was extremely pleasant by looking. The checkin was without a problem. What was surprising was that after I got out of the taxi, there was no doorman to help with the luggage.

We stayed in a senior suite with incredible Mediterranean views of Tangier’s harbor and Spain’s mountainous coastline across the Strait of Gibraltar. Our room was comfortable and the hotel provided every amenity imaginable in the bathroom and large closet. But the best aspect of our room was its location next to Chambre 35, which is where Henri Matisse lived and painted during his time in Tangier. It is the one room in the hotel which has retained original electric fixtures and furniture and well worth the visit if you’re a guest.

The staff at the reception was very friendly and helpful from the moment I first called from the U.S. to make reservations. Muhsin, Morad, Mohamed and Abdella were very kind at all times. Communication was not a problem as they spoke English and Spanish (and also French and of course, Arabic and Marroqui). The hotel is gated and the security seemed to be very good.

In fact, if I had paid even double that price, I'd probably give the property three stars, and I can't even begin to imagine paying the rack rate (7000 MAD a night) for the room. That having been said, a duplex suite at that price was incredibly affordable. The hotel website listed the suite as having sea views and a terrace - both of which are *technically* true, but the terrace is exactly at ground level, right next to the terraces of the adjoining duplex suites - so you don't have a lot of privacy there - and the balcony that overlooks the swimming pool and is supposed to look out to the sea is too small even to fit a chair out onto…",Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Grand_Hotel_Villa_de_France,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms. Breakfast is basic. Staff is unhelpful. they have a sister property - El Minzah. If you want spa services you are directed to this hotel. Not worth it. Very basic. This hotel is located just outside the Medina, which is quite noisy late into the night.

 August 2017,3,"Visually pleasing, but seriously lacking.","Hotel was beautiful, great views, charming, good location next to the market. However it seriously lacks the basic services needed to be given a 5 star rating. No water given in the room, VERY poorly stocked minibar, not even water in that! (in a hot country). No laundry service, no airport transfer option, very poor room service menu. The service throughout the hotel wasnt great with the exception of the gentlemen who worked in the ground floor bar. The hotel pool was beautiful but it took an AGE to get a drink, surely you would think to put a bar near the pool? Or waiters constantly there to provide drinks? Not to mention the outside terrace area which was the most beautiful part of the hotel, but was nearly impossible to get service there throughout the day.

 July 2017,2,"So much potential, yet rude staff","This hotel looks beautiful from the entrance and featured a beautiful pool. They couldn't find my reservation upon arrival and instead of trying to handle it themselves (it was booked through a third party), implied I had lied that the reservation was made and asked me to call the third party numerous times for the booking confirmation, to re-email them the reservation, etc. Once they finally 'received' the booking, we were shown to our room which was very old and poorly made up. The particular front desk manager who had treated me so poorly upon arrival saw us walking to the restaurant later on and pulled me aside, while he was with other guests, and told me that they hadn't received payment and needed it ASAP (again, this had already been taken care of by the third party).

 July 2017,4,Good hotel but not a Grand Hotel,"Overall the hotel was good but far from perfect. Service was very good whenever someone was present to give it. Very often there was no answer when calling guest service, nor was there often an answer when calling from the outside. There are no phones on the floor (at least I found none). This was critical because at 3 occasions my key did not work and had to be replaced. Instead of just calling from the floor, I had to walk to the reception changing buildings and taking two elevators. This is not easy for someone being handicapped. The room was small and there was no shower other than in the bathtub. When asking for a different room with a shower cabin, reception told me there is none. The bath/toilet floor was stained.

The breakfast was delicious, a variety of meats, fruits, cereals and Moroccan food. The rooms were beautiful, we had one facing the pool. Staff were very sweet. It was ramandan when we went so things were pretty quiet during the day. The gym is at the sister hotel, a short walk down the road. The tennis court is up the road at a club. You need to ask at reception to book a court (we were wanting to be active amongst the site seeing).

And they can arrange a tour of the Old Medina and Kasbah. Just ask for their contract driver and guide Mo Mo. He has 40 years of experience and can tell you things about Tangier and Morocco no one else knows. Request a room overlooking the Medina. The call to prayer at night is a classic experience. Open your window and just listen as the cool breeze from the ocean comes in. Look down on the entrance to the Grand Soco and see the activity.

I stayed in the Superior Double Room, which is very roomy and I don't really see any point in going for the bigger and slightly more expensive types of room unless you want to stay next to the pool. There are some room for improvement. The water pressure was almost to good in the shower and the cleaners missed some spots in the bathroom, leaving traces (some hair etc) from former guests on the floor.

Bed was comfortable and they provide you with robes and slippers which are always appreciated. We had a lovely platter of fruit waiting for us in our room, Service was excellent, everyone was friendly and attentive. The other nice thing is they have a late check out (1 pm).

Breakfast included in the price was a little slim, but then again, I'm an American! Proximity to the Medina kept us out of the car and parking was free.

However, they are not well maintained; lamp bulbs missing, not enough toilet paper, a shower “hanging down” and hardly usable, a safe not working and a minibar with only about half the stock indicated. For the price we paid this is not good enough! The hotel itself is very nice with pictures painted by Matisse, who stayed at the hotel for three years.

It was lovely, just like my visit last year. Only shame was it was very quiet. Though it is still low season. There was a conference going on when we arrived but they left and then it was just a handful of guests. The staff were lovely, couldnt do enough for us. I love the views from the terrace, and from my room.

Its lobby, courtyard, bar, terraces and dining areas are quiet, peaceful, and redolent of a time when life moved at a more leisurely pace than is the case today. The room was spacious and well-appointed. The location, just outside the medina, is excellent. The staff are all friendly and eager to help.

The hotel is very centrally located. 5 minutes walk and we are in the Old Medina. Breakfast in the hotel was tasty and in good quantity. WiFi was free.

 April 2016,4,Enjoyable hotel with pleasant staff in Tangier,"We were able to drive to the hotel and pull right in, then the gate was opened and we drove up the steep horseshoe drive to the entrance. The hotel took care of the rental car return which was a nice boon. The area seems to have been once quite grand, but now slightly seedy -- which might be a description of most of Tangier. In contrast, Tetouan, where we stopped on the way seemed beautiful. The hotel is smallish and a little quirky in design, which is nice. The medina is close by, an easy walk. The ferry is a short taxi ride away. The are a number of interesting restaurants close by and the breakfast (not included) is quite nice.

Check in was okay but the chap said he was a manager and, to be honest, he gave the impression that he was too busy to deal with us. He couldn't even give us a local map and told us to come back later. The hotel was very quiet due to the time of year and so lacked any atmosphere. The cocktail bar staff were great and friendly but there were no other guests. Breakfast was relatively poor for a hotel of this standard. Yes there was the usual fresh fruit options, yogurt, croissants, etc but the only hot options on offer were rice and a type of red sausage that didn't look too appetising but tasted okay.

 February 2016,1,Really bad. Overpriced!,"Basically had many issues when staying here. For the price they charge I thought the staff would care a bit more. The worst of my issues were when checking in I had a staff member lead me to ""my"" room only to walk in on another mans room when he wasn't fully dressed as he yelped. It was very embarrassing. And THEN.. The next morning I was still in bed at 830am and Someone else walked into my room with their luggage. I went down to complain (I never complain but this was an obvious SECURITY & PRIVACY ISSUE ) and was basically told the only compensation I could receive is to stay another night and give them another 1200 Dirham and they would give me a little bigger room.

 December 2015,5,Beautiful and historic property in the heart of Tangier,"We recently stayed at this fine hotel for 4 days over Christmas and absolutely loved it. I knew it had closed for a while and I didn’t see it beforehand, but the renovated hotel is beautiful and the location is excellent. This is a historic hotel and boasts the fact that Henri Matisse lived here for almost a year for inspiration. The hotel itself is only a few minutes from the main square and the medina of Tangier near several shops, markets and restaurants. The cab from the Tangier airport only takes about 20 minutes and should be no more than 150 dirhams. We were greeted at the car when we pulled up and the folks at the front desk could not have been nicer.

 November 2015,5,"Superb hotel! Stay here, you won't regret it.","This hotel was once at the center of diplomatic life in Tangier, but it had gradually fallen into disuse and was abandoned for many years. The owners (who also own the venerable El Minzah hotel nearby) have done a wonderful job of renovating it. They have brought the hotel right up to date, while retaining all the period flourishes that give it such style. Everything is done in impeccable taste. The hotel is well situated on a hill overlooking the medina, which is a few minutes walk away. It has a large and pleasant garden, with ample terraces to enjoy the outdoors and take in the views. The public rooms are beautifully furnished and welcoming. There is a spectacular pool in a secluded courtyard behind the main building.

 December 2015,4,Suite Property with Great Views,"Loved my stay here over the course of four nights. The weather in early December was uncharacteristically warmer than usual. As a result, I was able to open my shutters and windows each day and enjoy the warm salty air or the Straits. Given it's an older and historic property, it didn't have all the finer amenities available in the modern hotels, it made up for it with its quaint charm. Outside my windows were the views that inspired some of the work by artist Henri Matisse and it was absolutely relaxing.

 December 2015,5,Fabulous stay at a great value price,"We treated ourselves to this 5 star in the middle of a month in Morroco. We were not sure the extra for the superior room, high up with a Matisse view of the town and the harbour, would be worth blowing the budget. Well, it was well worth the extra and it cost far less than £100 a night including a great breakfast and use of the indoor pool in the nearby El Minzah (which we thought was not nearly as nice as the Villa). It was too cold in December to use the beautiful unheated outdoor pool at the Villa. We stayed in a room with amazing decor using Matisse shapes of leaves in subtle colours, and in a restrained fashion, on all the fabrics, the furniture and carpets.

The hotel is in a delightful setting in a very central, elevated position, sitting back from the Grande Socco. You can share the same views of the town and harbour that Matisse had when he painted his famous 'window' painting. Our large, well appointed room had tasteful decor and period fittings that reflected some of the motifs Matisse used. We received a very warm welcome with excellent service throughout.

For starters, the hotel is in a great location - on the border between the newer part of town and the old city. The hotel overlooks the Grand Socco and because of its elevation, provides a great view of the harbor and the Strait of Gibraltar, all the way back to Spain.
