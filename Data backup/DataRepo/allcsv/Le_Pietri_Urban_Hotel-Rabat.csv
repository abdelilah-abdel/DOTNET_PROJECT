 December 2022,5,Fifth visit to Le Pietri - My home away from home,"Le Pietri is in a great location with very friendly helpful staff. The low floor street side rooms are a bit noisy at times. They have a nice variety and tasty breakfast and dinner menu with good wine options and a bar all in a comfortable space. We enjoyed an amazing jazz concert on a Saturday night. All in all a comfortable place to hang out with friends, be alone and get around the city. I will defiantly return.",hotelName,city
 October 2022,4,Modern business style hotel close to the station - good value,Modern almost business style hotel Not much character but comfortable room and very friendly staff. Easy walk to the Medina and railway station - 5 minute taxi to other key attractions. Would recommend.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2022,4,Well located,"The Hotel staffs were friendly and the hotel is well located with easy access. However, the windows were not totally noise proof and activities from the bar/Karaoke night kept me awake. Also the breakfast did not have a wide variety and became monotonous by the third day. You could improve on the breakfast.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2022,5,Excellent,I had a lovely stay here for 2 nights. The room and hotel is tastefully decorated and it was very clean. The staff is professional and very nice and helpful. They had a restaurant with great and delicious food and a good vibe. Definetely recommend this place.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2022,1,Very UNPROFESSIONAL restaurant female staff member needs to behave herself,"I do not recommend this hotel because of their failure to recruit professional staff in their restaurant. PS: Both rmale receptionists were polite & professional. The same for a male waiter who was working in restaurant that day. However, a member of the restaurant staff was EXTREMELY RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL. This was woman with black hair, wearing black suit, and was in charge of breakfast the day of my check-out on 8 Sep 2022. 2 unprofessional behaviours from her in less than 20 mins: 1/ As I was trying to grab a chair in the restaurant where breakfast is served, she, out of the blue, shouted out loud ""Madam!"" and then pointed at me with her hand for me to move out of that table to another one facing the bar. Everyone at the restaurant looked at me as if I was committing a…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2022,5,Excellent stay at Le Pietri,"We booked this hotel because we were not happy with our RIad in Medina. This hotel is clean, nicely decorated, modern and has everything you need for a quick stay in Rabat. It's also very close to the main attractions.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2022,5,Pietri is the best hotel ever,"Best experience in a hotel. This is the best hotel I have ever been to and I have been to hundreds of hotels. Despite the poverty, the misery, the corruption etc… there is something very special about the Moroccan hospitality. I have never received this service before in any hotel anywhere in the world: my husband asked me to bring some Moroccan fabrics. I had them in a plastic container. The doorman Najid at Le Pierti Hotel turned it into a suitcase so I can carry it. The best service is here at this hotel",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 November 2021,5,Highly recommended,"I stayed for 2 weeks in Le Pietri, and was very impressed. I had a suite room, which was huge, with a big outdoor terrace. The room was clean, modern and stylish. It was quiet in terms of no outside noise (although you could hear alot of noise from the corridor, inside, whenever anyone opened or closed their doors). The restaurant and breakfast was good. The staff were really friendly and helpful. And the location is excellent - close to the Medina and the city centre, with pleasant walking and lots of good restaurants nearby. I'd definitely choose Le Pietri next time I visit Rabat.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 November 2019,4,No shower!,"I would love nothing better than to give a top rating to this hotel. I have knocked a star off because the shower in our room didn’t work. When I asked them to fix it, they said that it couldn’t be fixed and that they would have to purchase and install a new handheld shower unit. I’m sure that this was not a new defect. Otherwise, this was a great hotel with a wonderful restaurant.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 October 2019,5,Comfortable Modern Property,This property is conveniently located in Downtown Rabat. The parking is a challenge but the staff goes out of their way to help put your vehicle in a convenient spot. The rooms are spacious with very comfortable beds. The attached restaurant is excellent. Service is excellent.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2019,5,Flawless service.,"The hotel is more European then Moroccan. Clean well appointed room, nice reception, strong and fast WiFi, helpful stuff. Rich breakfast. Easy parking on the street. Lack of English news channels is a minus.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 July 2019,5,"Fine hotel, great value, helpful staff","Modern, clean, with helpful staff and a good convenient restaurant. Several excellent meeting spaces available, including an outdoor terrace. Good location -- taxi drivers all seem to know it! Feels like an urban hotel, that is, in the middle of town.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 July 2019,4,A most pleasant stay,"The hotel is ideally located close to Rabat Ville station The rooms are very clean, comfortable and well maintained. Toiletries are minimal. So nice to have a fridge and a free of charge safe in the room. Bonuses are that the hotel has its own enclosed patio area for relaxing, having drinks or a light snack and an onsite Jazz Bistro. Breakfasts offered a good selection with staff on duty to assist. Although the reception staff were very helpful and efficient, they were not very talkative. Perhaps this was because I don't speak French or Arabic. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will re-book for future visits.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 July 2019,5,"Clean hotel, good location","Clean bedroom, bathroom, good location, excellent restaurant (and great breakfast). Our room was nonsmoking and had no smoke scent.

 April 2019,5,Very Comfortable Place to Stay,"We stayed at this hotel twice during our trip to Morocco. Both times we found the facilities to be very good. The rooms, while small, were clean and comfortable. The people at the front desk were helpful in answering our questions and assisting us. The hotel is conveniently located, walkable to one of the train stations and two nearby museums. The restaurant in the hotel provides an extensive breakfast and offers excellent French food in the evening. We ate there each time that we stayed at the hotel and were pleased with the quality of the food. If we go back to Rabat, we will stay there again.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 April 2019,4,Amazing staff!! They will do anything to help!,"The room was simple but clean. Stay here for the convenient location, wonderful breakfast, and the absolutely most wonderful staff!!

 April 2019,5,"CLEAN, MODERN, AND YOU CAN’T BEAT THE LOCATION!","This small business hotel was just perfect for our first night in Morocco. Fresh from the trans-Atlantic flight, we needed a place for a good shower and some sleep. Le Pietri delivers on both fronts. If the traditional Moroccan riad is what you are looking for, keep moving. But Le Pietri is clean, the staff are polite and helpful, and I just wish we could have spent more time on our Terrace! To top it off, Le Pietri is located just 5 minutes’ walk from the Rabat Train Station making it an ideal launching or midway spot for your Moroccan adventures!",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 April 2019,4,We'd decided to stay another night!,"Very nice hotel. When we arrived by car, they let us park just in front of the hotel – while we were really afraid of not finding a slot in the city. We liked our room but it was so convenient and clean it made us almost forget being in Morocco. Also the hotel's food was really enjoyable. Breakfast though was average.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 April 2019,5,A great boutique hotel,"Located near the Medina, a small boutique hotel in a walking distance from the market and Rabat ville. There’s a nice restaurant with live music. Nice modern and clean rooms, generous breakfast and friendly stuff.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 April 2019,5,A comfortable hotel in town center,"Very well located. Clean and comfortable. Everything in perfect working order, which is seldom to be found ib lical hotels. Nice welcome at reception. To be recommended. No parking facilities, so this might be tricky.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 March 2019,4,"2nd visit, after 9 years","The hotel has been completely renovated. For the best ? I dont know because in our room, end of March, it was so warm... the ventilation system was still on winter programming so no way to have a bit of air conditioning and with the window open it was a bit noisy. The staff is polite and professionnal period, they dont offer more than what is asked. The restaurant is quite excellent.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 February 2019,5,Great Hotel and Excellent Staff!,"This hotel is nice and modern and very clean. The staff have been exceptionally good. The restaurant food and service were both fantastic.

 January 2019,5,"Solid Three-Star with Helpful, Considerate Staff, and Jazz","Property appears popular with younger travelers. Close to the central train station in a district rich with restaurants, museums, and shopping. Hotel is co-located with a restaurant that has live music. Hotel rooms and their appointments are as expected in a well-run, three-star property. Breakfast is terrific. Staff were exceptionally helpful. A special thanks to Hicham who went far beyond the call in helping with a delayed luggage problem. Only downside: with live jazz, it can be a bit of a challenge for those who go to bed early. It may help to ask for a quieter room it this is a concern. Still, it's jazz, not that loud, and doesn't go that late.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2018,5,Really good surprice - we will be back,"We came quite late one evening and met a very friendly, helpfull and positive reception - and stayed for three nights, because we enjoyed everything. This small hotel has fine design details, comfortable beds, clean and well-functioning in every way, and very good service. Relaxingly unpretentious and professional. Breakfast is really good - just ask for youghurt, fried eggs, espresso or.... The morning waitress is such a pleasure. We also enjoyed the luxury of dining in the delicious Bistro, and having a very short way back to the room. Service in Bistro also excellent. An easy walk from the Central Train Station, the pram and the Museum for Contemporary and Modern Art. A special thanks for the wonderful New Years party - a memory to treasure.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2018,5,A gem of a hotel,"Clean and comfortable rooms (we had a superior on the 5th floor, which had a spacious balcony) with tea/coffee making facilities and a little fridge. Extremely helpful and friendly front desk staff. Very professional feel. Less than 10 mins walk from the train station. Close to places of interest... Hassan II Tower and Mohammed V Mausoleum c. 20 mins walk, Kasbah of the Udayas c. 30 mins walk, Medina c. 15 mins walk, Royal Palace c. 10 mins walk. Highlight is the restaurant. We rarely eat in hotels, preferring to find special places off the tourist route BUT the Bistrot du Pietri at this hotel is not to be missed. Superb....like eating in top Paris or Brussels establishments. Attention to detail, flavour, freshness. Wonderful. Bravo!! Oh, and it has live jazz music on…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 October 2018,5,"Fun hotel, exactly as described","We really enjoyed our stay at Le Pietri. The rooms were very clean and modern and the beds were great. The in house restaurant was fantastic and a great option for someone who didn't want to have to go out for dinner.Additionally, I had accidentally double booked the rooms for our party and the hotel was very accommodating at making the necessary changes so that I would not get double charged.Location was right near city center which made it really easy to walk to the train center (5 min), to the mosque (20 min) and to the beach (45 min) for those who like to explore the city.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 March 2018,4,Attractive modern hotel in very good location,"We spent a few night at Le Pietri Urban and liked it a lot. It's a very nice, modern place in a very good location where we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. We had an attractive room with 2 single beds, a desk, a large bathroom, and a luggage rack which could hold for two suitcases and this seemed a rarity in .Morocco. Breakfast was buffet style, coffee, juice, eggs, sausage, fruits, breads, pastries, crepes. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. I recommend this place and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 July 2018,3,Good location and Nice Room,We were upgraded to a bigger room but I booked twin beds and we had a king. They said they would come change it but they never did. The room was very nice. We had trouble getting pool towels 2 days in a row . They said we needed a blue card and the front desk said they were out of blue cards.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 July 2018,4,Great especially for a short stay!,The service at reception was very welcoming. Hamza was very good. All our requests were well taken care of and all staff are helpful. The breakfast room smelled strongly of smoke so that was very dissapointing.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 January 2018,5,"This place is ""Urban""","People who tired of Moroccan style hotels/foods, visit this quartier and stay this hotel, it's totally urban and European.

Their restaurant is also incredibly great.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2017,5,Hip oasis,"Clean, pleasant, friendly, modern, and central. The restaurant is amazing fusion Moroccan with jazz.

The check in was easy and fast, the receptionist was very helpul and smiley, nice clean room as described with amenities such as shower gel, hand soap, clean towels, the breakfast was a fresh buffet, comparing with other hotels in Rabat, they should be four stars instead. A small highlight is that there was no top sheet only a comforter.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 October 2017,5,Excellent city centre hotel,This hotel is new to me. Normally stay in the Balima (now closed)or Majliss. What a loveley surprise!

 September 2017,5,Breakfast Bar,"I chose the Pietri as it is within easy walking distance of Rabat Ville station. Purpose of this was to decide whether to terminate my journey from Tanger, on the new TGV next year, at Rabat or Casalanca. (The Moroccan TGV is being bult for 2 billion Euro compared to 50 billion for HS2!), The hotel is one of the best I have stopped at during many trips in Morocco.There is a very relaxed atmosphere on the premises which in no way impairs an excellent and friendly service by all staff. The dining and bar area are called the Bistro and cater for non residents as well. The restaurant is excellent with an extensive choice of food and wine.

 September 2017,3,Modern Hotel Could Use Some Improvements,"The bed and location are fantastic as it is within walking distance to all the great sites in Rabat. Even Chellah was not a super long walk from this hotel. My biggest issues were in regards to the wifi, shower and TV. The shower itself is an accident waiting to happen as it sits very high up and invites the very real possibility of a slip and fall accident. The wifi was spotty at best and often lagged when needed most. The TV though was both small and noisy. Every channel would emit a loud buzzing/static noise every 10 minutes or so as you watch a movie. It felt as if I was watching a VHS tape that had been worn out with all the lines and static running through it. There was also several floorboards that we displaced and gaps running through them. The breakfast service was…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2017,4,Pretty good,We stayed two nights on our way from Fes to Agadir. This wasn't our first visit here.

 August 2017,4,Happy customer 😎,First time in Rabat and I'm glad I made the right choice for my stay. Very nice and friendly staff specially Mr. Esaam. A very good restaurant and the breakfast has many choices to eat. I would say all is well for this hotel.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 September 2016,4,Friendly and a touch of jazz,"This is good little hotel, clean with friendly people.

 May 2017,5,Excellent frienfly service,"I have stayed numerous times at the Hotel Le Pietri over the last 10 years. Everyone I have encountered there has been friendly, helpful, and many, especially the manager, have gone out of their way to help me and my colleagues with our specific needs during work stays.

The hotel staff provides excellent service, the food is very good, and the music venue always gives a very special atmosphere. A real pearl in the heart of Rabat.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 May 2017,4,"Comfortable, clean, cool","We stayed at the Le Pietri for two nights. Our room was on the fourth floor facing the street. Very quiet room even with music going on in the bistro downstairs. The queensize bed was comfortable. The bathroom clean and well furnished. Free WiFi was speedy enough.

 April 2017,5,A great stay,"Having lived in Rabat for over three years and visited the restaurant at Pietri in the past it was an obvious choice for a 5 night stay. Central, near the Gare de Ville and tram line. We were not disappointed. Lovely clean, quiet room, great, helpful staff. We knew the restaurant was good, again the staff were excellent. Les sessions Pietri are worth attending. Breakfast was simple but good. Great venue for other cafes, restaurants, Oudayas, casbah, Chellah, the medina and all the other touristy stuff.

 March 2017,4,A trendy place for a pleasant stop-over,"Nicely looked after, conveniently located just minutes away from Rabat-ville train station and just a 10-minute walk from the medina, this hotel does what it says and proved to be even nicer than expected. The room was certainly clean and quiet. It is situated right at the heart of the ville nouvelle, modern part of Rabat and close enough to most points of interest. One of the perks is that one of the trendiest bars in town, Le Bistrot du Pietri, is actually part of the hotel! Live music on Fridays and Saturdays which is mostly jazz oriented and the place does boast that typical jazz bar atmosphere for those who are used to it; hopefully you'll know what I mean!

 February 2017,3,One night in Rabat,Hotel was very new. Room was small but clean. We liked the wooden floor. Located in a small road near the train station. Souks and shops nearby. Not advisable to travel by road because of heavy traffic everywhere!,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 February 2017,5,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent Hotel - very friendly staff - good menue - multilingual staff (german, french, english, arabic) - clean rooms - nice ambiente. Near the Market of Rabat - only 5 minutes away by walk. moneychange-offices are nearby the hotel",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2017,4,Excellent Hotel,"This is a Value for Money hotel, I had a very good experience during my stay. I had a very fast and easy Checkin with very professional front desk staff member. Rooms size is good comfortable bed and pillow. Clean rooms and good cleaning service. Check out is also nice and fast. Hotel location is very good and it's a walkin distance to a lot of shops and food places. The only thing is breakfast has very small variety and not a lot of things on the table. It's a highly recommended hotel",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2017,4,Very Enjoyable Stay,"My sister and I stayed at Le Petri Urban Hotel for two nights in January. One of the great advantages of this hotel is that it is ideally situated. It is an easy 10 minute walk from the main train station and also the tram. Additionally, there is a lovely Contemporary Art Museum two minutes from the hotel. We took a taxi to the Kasbah, Medina and Chellah, but were able to walk back to the hotel after our visits. When we arrived at the hotel we were offered an upgrade to a suite, as our rooms were on a lower floor and there was going to be a private party in the Jazz Club that evening. We appreciated the offer! The room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. The staff are very pleasant and were helpful in answering our questions and providing information. The breakfast was…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2016,4,Thank you veru much !,"Thank you very much for everything, you are doing great. The room was very nice and also the bathroom. The restaurant where we had breakfast is even nicer and the staff is kind and organised. I would recommend this hotel to friends & family, and I look forward to go again!",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2016,4,Good Hotel with a good Restaurant,"Our experience at Le Pietri is positive. We enjoyed the bar-restaurant a lot. The staff is helpful, the room was clean and comfortable. Just two little negative things: the shower didn't work, so we had a bath; breakfast was good, but not the bread, it was old and tough.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2016,4,My Stay at LaPietri,"I would say it was a pretty good experience to stay at LaPietri ... Staff was very cordial, in particular Mr. Hamza who made a huge difference right from the bookings till the moment I left. The guy in the restaurant was also impressive and very cooperative. The restaurant at the dinner time was too crowded, however, the food was excellent. In sum, I enjoyed my stay at LaPietri and I would be happy to recommend it to my friends and whosoever is intending to visit Rabat. I wish all the best to the management and associated team.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 December 2016,4,Solid choice,"All the basics done right: easy check-in, clean room, great bed, good bathroom, hot water, good breakfast, helpful luggage storage..... No major complaints. There was a slight off smell in the room that we didn't bother calling about. We had to call for a second set of towels. The 1st Fl (2nd Fl in USA) room could here the music from the Bistro/club downstairs until it closed at midnight. You may want to ask for a room on a higher floor if you go to bed early. For us the music was not an issue as we had a great time in the Bistro. We had looked for dinner in the medina and were not impressed. We came back and we're surprised to find the Bistro crowded. We drank wine at the bar until a table was available. The food (international/Moroccan) was very good and the live band…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2016,5,Deserve its title of Urban Hotel,"I have stayed many times at this hotel over the course of 2-3 years and enjoyed it very much every time. The rooms are very clean, well serviced, nice amenities, and they are part of the Green Key programme aimed at reducing footprints. Very central, about 500 meters from the train station, 200 meters from the fantastic Modern Art Museum, 100 meters from the 6eme symphony, a cheap watering hole with a very diverse crowd and two underground levels, the second one with a scene for student bands belting out rock/funk/pop tunes. The Pietri itself has a great bar often serving live jazz/funk/african music, one the best scenes of Rabat, although as such it does draw a crowd that seems a bit snooty sometimes. Morning Breakfast is a brilliant and generous affair of all you can eat…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 November 2016,5,The perfect 3-star hotel,"Le Pietri wins on location (central), friendliness, upkeep, breakfast and rooms, all at a good price. The bar and restaurant, with live music at the weekends (don't worry about noise in the rooms though), is a big extra plus.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2016,4,"Nice, clean, ideally placed","It was renovated, clean and nice rooms. Ideally placed in a smaller street near the flower market. Friendly staff, very good breakfast. Went there for two night during the week for business. Had rooms at the 4th floor. Not hearing any noise from neighbouring rooms. only some talking of children in the evening. No traffic noise. Liked the style. Seems to have music on weekends, nice style of the lounge.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 July 2016,4,"Great location, modern ameninities","We stayed here the last night of a two week vacation in Morocco. It's right next to the train station, the tram station, and not too far from the airport, making the location very convenient for travelers. The room was modern and simple, a contrast to all the Riads we'd been staying at. The staff was nice but down to business, which was a bit of a change from the Riads that are mostly family-owned and take time to get to know you and help you with anything. This hotel is very very close to the new Modern Art Museum, and that is definitely worth a visit. Overall- this place feels like a Western hotel, and even has an expensive restaurant and jazz bar to give you that Euro vibe. It's convenient, but lacked the Moroccan flare and hospitality we loved at all the family-owned…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 June 2016,4,Good service and good value hotel,"Le Pietri is a hotel with restaurant that also doubles as a jazz bar. It's a short walk from Rabat train station and Place Al Joulane tram stop. Staff were consistently friendly and helpful and I was able to check in early. The rooms are clean with a comfortable bed. Noise may be an issue from the street but not the bar, at least not on the third floor rooms. The towels were noticeably worn. The bathtub is deeper than usual so stepping in and out could be awkward and along with the glass barrier by the bathtub which does little to prevent water from getting on the floor during a shower this could be a safety issue. There's a small breakfast buffet but you may need to bring your own bag if you're checking out early and want breakfast to go. The restaurant is good value…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 May 2016,2,"Central location, mediocre breakfast, noisy on the lower floors",Avoid rooms on the first and if possible second floor. Noise from music and other guests on the terrace makes it almost impossible to sleep until early hours of the morning and then you doors banging just a few hours later. Receptionists try to accommodate but you also feel you might be given the runaround.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 April 2016,4,A Pleasant Surprise,"No room at a Medina hotel that I had needed to confirm, so after a little stressful search found a room here, recommended, very close to the Gare de Rabat Ville that I had just left. So, after a nice pizza, walked back to the hotel where a room was waiting. They spoke English and were very helpful. My room was immaculate and if I hadn't known, I would have thought I was on the continent somewhere. Bed was comfortable and shower forceful: no complaints about the amenities. To me, however, it just lacked a Moroccan flavour. Good value. Average breakfast. This place is close to the Hassan Tower and garden and 3 km to the Kasbah of the Udaiyas",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 April 2016,5,HOSPITALITY,"clean and nice hotel very nice stuff members ,friendly people travelling to Morocco since 1995, must say this hotel is outstanding in regard to price and service it os located quite in the center; good location close to the railway station",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 February 2016,5,Clean and comfortable hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for one night in February. I was very pleased with my experience. I arrived in Rabat by train and this hotel is very close to the train station, just a few minutes walking distance. The location is pretty central and there are shops and restaurants close. Staff was very helpful and spoke English. The hotel is small but well taken care of. I was traveling alone but I got a big room with a big and very comfortable king size bed. The room was modern and clean. Bathroom too, with a bath and good working shower. The hotel is more business orientated and you don't really get the feeling that you are in Morocco. That suited me fine, but if you are looking for something more authentic this may not be the place for you. Breakfast didn't have a lot of choice but…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2015,5,Excellent base for Rabat and Train travel,"In all respects the service was excellent, the room comfortable with all expected facilities. It is centrally located within easy walking distance of the station, tram, shops and market. I traveled to a wedding in Sale and a day in Casablanca.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2016,4,Warmly recommended,"I really liked this hotel. The desk staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are very clean and adequate without any frills, with a good pleasant bathroom. The rooms could do with some more electric plugs in the wall. There was only one in my room and not even for the desk lamp which it was impossible to plug in. Breakfast is pleasant and the hotel is well situated close to the railway station and several quite decent restaurants. I was there for a week so there was plenty of time to have a complete experience of the hotel. The drawbacks are that there is no swimming pool or working out space. But at least there is free wifi which is moderately good.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2015,4,One of the best in Morocco,Very close to train station if that's the way you are coming from. My room is small but very adequately decorated and very clean. It is modern looking. Breakfast is decent as well. The staff are all very polite. The neighborhood is awesome. Very close to the government area. There is really not much to complain about and I recommend this place to anyone visiting Rabat.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2015,4,Friendly staff - exellent food in Bistro - deafening live music at night,"Downsides - music from the restaurant can be very disturbing. In fact it ruined the stay. Upside - the reception staff and porter were incredibly welcoming and hospitable. More French in their attitude than Moroccan (take that comment positively, negatively or both...) Room was clean",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 November 2015,4,Love their bistro!,"Been here a couple of times by myself or with business partners and it was always a great dining experience. Fine dining and elegantly lighted, food was very good, good crowd to hang out and chill after a tiring day's work. Waiters/staff can be more attentive to customers though. Overall, the experience was great.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2015,5,Center city hôtel in Rabat with great service and tremendous food,I'm a fan of Hôtel le Pietri. I'm staying there a week per month for business. The rooms were recently renovated. Le Pietri is also one of the best table of Rabat. And they serve the entire restaurant menu via room service. What a luxury. The personnel cares for you and is entirely problem solving oriented. For me it's the best deal in town.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 April 2015,4,Nice hotel with friendly staff,"This is a nice hotel with friendly staff. They have a bar where there is live music during some nights in the week. The atmosphere is very good in the hotel. The rooms are maybe a little outdated, but it didn't bother me at all.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 June 2015,4,Stayed during Ramadan / great staff,"I spent a week at the Pietri in June/July 2015 during Ramadan. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. The room was pleasant, if not very big. Very conveniently located a few blocks from the central train station. Breakfast was a bit of a light affair, especially given the need to eat well at breakfast during Ramadan. Dinners were a buffet format, with a variety of salads, three main dishes, soups, snacks and desserts. It got crowded in the evenings, so even if staying at the hotel it may be worth reserving a table. During Ramadan everyone arrives more or less at the same time, and then starts eating at the same time (7:45 p.m. the week I was there). It was thus quite crowded at the buffet during the crucial minutes leading up to the breaking of the fast, and things…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 May 2015,4,"Nice, clean, stylish hotel","I often stay here for my business trips in Rabat and I enjoy it. The bulding itself seems old but I believe that it has been renovated and now the hotel has a very stylish and modern look (which I I enjoy very much). I also appreciate the friendly staffs. I also like the breakfast buffet. Although there is not a big variety of dishes it's enough for me and I enjoy some of the fancy small pastries they offer. I believe the restaurant downstairs hosts live jazz concerts on Friday nights so some guests who aren't interested in these concerts and just want to sleep in early could be bothered by the noise. I've personally never had this problem, but if you're worried you could ask the hotel to get you a quiet room. Over all I like the hotel and this is why I continue to stay here…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 May 2015,1,Pretentious and overpriced,My partner and i had a few days left in Morocco and wanted to splurge a little in a fancy hotel for a few nights and ended up leaving after a single night because of a few reasons. Right from the beginning we were greeted by a pretentious and disrespectful receptionist who barely looked us in the eye. He refused to grant us a room with a double bed and put us in a room with two single beds. When we complained he kept trying to up sell us to the more expensive suites even though we booked a standard room in advance. I asked to speak with the manager and he said he was unavailable. Finally after a lot of back and forth he suddenly found a room available for us despite saying they were all fully booked a few moments ago. We decided to have dinner in the hotel restaurant which…,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 February 2015,4,Good option for overnight in Rabat,"We stayed here for one night breaking our journey from Ifrane to Marrakech. The hotel was easy to find, off a side street right beside the new contemporary museum of modern art. The staff at reception were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms need a little updating and I felt they did not reflect what was published on the website but they were very clean and comfortable. The main feature of the hotel is a lively restaurant and bar which we really enjoyed.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2015,4,A Real Hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel in a classic European-style city with neat urban boulevards. The hotel has all the right amenities that you would expect for a hotel around the $100 mark. It was very clean, the room large with a view and a full complement of satellite channels. There was even an excellent bar which can be a rarity in parts of Morocco. I couldn't fault it in service standards, cleanliness or amenities. However, it does have more of the business rather than a tourist vibe.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2014,4,Good stay,"We chose Le Pietri for one night during travelling through Marocco. Positive: The location was easy to find from the Rabat Ville Train Station. The room was very stylish, modern and clean, with a useful and detailed guide book of information from all services and instructions. Wifi was working well in the room. The breakfast was very rich, great selection of food and you can eat as many as you can.:)) Staff was friendly and so helpful, they helped us to print our boarding cards from the internet on the reception. There were technical problems but they were very patient and assisted until we succedd :) Thank you! Negative: The safe was not working at all. The hole in the tub was not able to close for bathing. We could pay with credit card, but they wanted to charge much more…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2014,3,90's Travelodge but the Bistro made it,We stayed here as a stopover in late December as a last minute decision to break up our journey from Fes to Marrakech. After a long train journey we were pleased to find this hotel was within walking distance from the train station and well signposted so very easy to find and well located for a day's wander around Rabat. Having read the latest review plus the fact a picture of our room was not on the booking website we were a bit dubious about what we would be sleeping in - the rooms certainly do have an outdated 1990's Travelodge feel - very basic and dull. However we only stayed one night so couldn't grumble. The bistro attached was the saviour of this hotel! It had a great jazz vibe (we were a little disappointed to miss one of the famous jazz sessions as this would normally…,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2014,3,they cannot have tried harder to be average,"This is a small hotel well located in Rabat. I checked in late and had to agree to order room service. The meal was fine however I had to go through a palaver to get this - no menu in the room, order the menu, waiter demanding an instant order, refusal by me, then order by phone. The room I had was fine though one that I could not warm up. I had problems with the safe and the hotel porter had problems getting it to work and in the end I did not use it The bed had blankets and sheets - something I have not experience d for years in a hotel. I managed to pull the sheet out every night and ended up covered by an itchy blanket. I think that all these small things started telling on me that stopped me enjoying my stay The breakfast was OK - but they never seemed to replace food that…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2014,4,Nice stay,"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. Its in a pretty central location. Due to this central location it can be quite noisy due to all the hussle n bussle outside. The hotel staff were very helpful & friendly. The hotel in my opinion is a little dated, rooms rather basic, but if its a short stay than its not the end of the world. I found the room to be clean & tidy, the shower was amazing ! Its a smoking hotel, so that was something I wasn't too keen on and found the smell of cigarettes to be quite unpleasant. The highlight of my stay was the restaurant, it is fantastic. I ate there 2 nights and I have to say, the service was good, but the food was excellent. On the Tuesday night, a band played whilst I ate, which was really nice. Breakfast is good, it does the job. I was in town…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2014,5,Excellent,Very pleasant hotel in the center of town. Le Pietri has a wonderful contemporary decor and all the amenities required by the urban traveler. Rooms are comfortable and stylish and the atmosphere is intimate as the hotel is small. There is an excellent restaurant on site. Will definitely return when I'm back in Rabat.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2014,3,Good location,"We stayed here one night before heading back to Casa. The hotel in Rabat is fairly expensive compare to the rest of Morocco. But we did enjoy our stayed in this hotel and it was about 10 minutes walk from and to the train station. The room and the bathroom were fairly comfortable size and clean. WiFi was a little slow but adequate. There is a restaurant in the hotel and have live Jazz music but we only have our breakfast there and it was just basic continental style and not much choices. There are lots of restaurants around the area, a block or 2 before the train station from the main road and turn right for another block or 2. La Mama grill Italian is pretty good and lots of selection and reasonable. We used taxi to go to Chellah, the Roman ruins, hassan Tower and the Kasbah.…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 October 2014,4,"Unchallenging, comfortable european styled hotel","If you're needing european standards anaesthetised from moroccan adventure you can't go wrong here. Formulaic rooms and generally good standards throughout, the hotel also has a lively bistro with either live or recorded jazz to accompany your evening meal. Friendly reception staff.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 May 2014,3,"Good place for business in Rabat, compared to other hotels...","A pretty nice hotel in terms of rooms and service, but not cheap. Prices for hotels in Rabat are way over the top, no idea why everybody thinks they can charge people like in NYC. I liked the rooms (clean and spacious) and the outdoor terrace on the first floor, Internet was usually ok, breakfast was very limited and did not really have much to choose from. Locations of the Pietri is very good - just about 3 minutes from the main train station.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 May 2014,4,Great business hotel,"Very good rooms, terrace to have lunch and bar for cocktails with great live music tuesdays and fridays. In town centre so very easy to get around. Food is ok not amazing but ok. Really recommend for business trip.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2013,5,Love this place,"This is a great centre ville hotel-- much nicer than other hotels I've stayed in in Morocco. It is clean and well kept. The bathrooms are nice and modern. They have air conditioning. They have some sustainable features in the hotel. The Wifi was slow on my last stay; the stay before that it was fine. Breakfast is lovely provided the restaurant is open; I was a little disappointed with the breakfast on the terrace on my most recent visit. I've enjoyed the jazz and dinner in the restaurant several times. It's walking distance to the main Rabat train station, the Parliament building, and the medina. It's also close to the tram. I definitely recommend it!",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2013,5,Great Central Location - Good Value,"Good price/performance ratio. Please don't expect the bedding one would find in a Grand Hyatt. If you are fussy, bring your own towels. There are some features or benefits worth noting: Order a tajine or couscous at the next door restaurant - and you find it wonderful ! Also, pick up some wonderful, perfect, fragrant, Morroccan roses - the Hotel abuts a square filled with wholesale/retail flower sellers. Also, it is walking distance to the old Medina. With a location like this - how could you go wrong? The staff is helpful and work hard.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 October 2013,3,Confortable and Central,"I stayed in Le Pietri for 3 nights during a business visit in Rabat. The Room: The room was spacious, and overall clean (with the exception of some stains in the couches). Rooms do not have hair dryers or irons, but if you call the reception they will be glad to bring it over. Wireless was available in the entire hotel at a good speed. A big minus was that they had Jazz nights I could hear the entire set being played in my room (including the cheering) which made it very difficult to sleep. Staff: The staff was friendly and wanted to help. Location: The hotel is well located and we were within walking distance from the train station, the medina, and many restaurants. However, it not very well known by the “petit taxis”, which made us returning to the hotel difficult, but as…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2013,4,Clean and Comfortable Stay,"I stayed for two nights after flying into Rabat-Sale Airport which was a short taxi ride from the hotel. It is also right down the street from the train station so it is easy to travel from here. The room was better than I expected for cleanliness and I slept like a rock. Shower and bathroom were also spotless and larger than expected. Wifi worked well, but not outstanding. The only complaint I can make is about the breakfast in the hotel restaurant. The juice was warm and there was really no selection for a ""continental"" style breakfast.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2013,5,Highly Recommend Le Pietri,"Accommodations were clean, staff were friendly and more than helpful and able to converse in several languages. The food in the Bistro is fresh and delicious. I recommend trying a glass of Moroccan red wine, Sahara, which was lovely. The hotel is central to all the major destinations in Rabat and close to taxis. All in all an excellent value and a hotel I recommend.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2013,1,THE JURY IS STILL OUT,"I only arrived last night so I have not formed a definitive opinion on the hotel. I am booked in here for the next week so I will be updating regularly. So far the restaurant was a total disaster yesterday evening. Cold sole fish, raw vegetables and indifferent staff. Breakfast was no better. WiFi didn t work but as far as the receptionist was concerned it was somehow my lack of comprehension of how to make it work. I have a feeling I am going to regret my stay",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2013,4,"Clean, Comfortable, Good value for money for a business stay","Location: Le Pietri is located in the Hassan part of Rabat close to the Cathedral, close to the Tram (all one way journeys are 6MAD) and close to the main Rabat railway station. This part of Rabat is pretty quiet. It is within a short 5-10 minute walk to Tour Hassan and access to some great restaurants like (Comeback, Cosmopolitan, Ty Potes). Le Bistro restaurant connected to the hotel is also a decent place to eat and socialise. Staff: the reception staff made me very welcome. Even though my French is poor the welcome was genuine, friendly & polite. Room: stay in the higher standard rooms on 4th floor to be furthest away from any chance of street noise.

 May 2013,4,Modern and Central,"The hotel is in a great location for the train station and Ville Nouvelle (it's also close to the Archaeological Museum). However, if you are interested in seeing the medina and kasbah, you are about a 15 dirham cab ride or 45 minute walk away. The hotel is modern, with comfortable bedding, and in-room wifi (a bit slow, and you have to keep switching back and forth between the different networks to get a solid connection). Continental breakfast is really basic (no tea and no fruit). Also situated right near a main street, so it was loud until about 11:30.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 January 2013,4,modern and confortable,"We stayed at Le Pietri the last night of our long tour of Morocco. We enjoyed some modern commodities. Le Pietri is clean and up-to-date. Our standard room was nice and modern; the bathroom was nice and the hot shower very appreciated. Unfortunately it took us a while to get asleep because our room was on the side of the lounge bar which on weekends turns into a disco and closes at 3am; you may ask for a businness room. The price is OK for a European standard, a bit expensive for Morocco. We arrived on Friday so we could enjoy a nice jazz concert in the lounge bar of the hotel. We could also find a table with no reservation after wayting 30 minutes at the bar. They serve alcoholic drinks; beer is expensive but cocktails are quite cheap. We expected the dinner to be expensive…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2013,4,Recommended,Rabat city is more proper than other cities in Morocco. But it is not easy to find an appropriate hotel for business stay. I can recommend this hotel. It's far from luxury but cozy. Internet connection is free with mediocre speed sometimes.,Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 September 2012,3,Clean and basic,"Room size was ok, but very basic. Bathroom reasonable size and clean. Staff were helpful. We used the restaurant downstairs for dinner as could not find anything else suitable within short distance of hotel, this was ok but thought expensive, paying for nightclub type experience. Depending on room placement, could not hear music from restaurant, but noise of people leaving restaurant venue at night could be a problem if your room is near the entrance door. Breakfast was varied and ok.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2012,3,Great staff and restaurant! But basic,"The staff were really helpful, good wifi, good ambience and food in restaurant. Location was great for walking around city tourist spots.

 May 2012,5,"Friendly, clean and chic urban hotel","Friendly staff and clean rooms made it easy to travel here with our 14-month old baby. The location is easy (5 minutes walk from the train station). Restaurant had very nice, well-arranged food (both Moroccan and international) and very good breakfast. The jazz sessions on some evenings are nice and well-visited (though we still got a table without a reservation) and - important for a family - the restaurant is well sound-proofed, so you can't hear anything from the rooms. When we needed to find a pharmacy Sunday morning, the receptionist had someone drive me to the nearest open place. They were always happy to explain the way, call a grand taxi, wash the bottles for our son (!), etc. Very helpful.

 January 2012,5,A clean and modern hotel in strategic position. Very advisable,"This is a very clean and professionally run hotel, at a short walking distance from Rabat Ville station. Rooms are very clean and have recent furniture. Bathrooms are ok as well. Breakfast is quite complete, but probably has some margin for improving. The internal Bistrot is an elegant place offering absolutely good food. I can certainly confirm the positive reviews that I read about this great hotel.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 February 2012,4,"Central, clean - a few drawbacks, but overall good. I'd stay again","A small hotel close to the central train station, and the new tram system (handy if you want to go over to Sale). Also walking distance to good shopping and many of the things you want to see with a lively street scene not too far away. This ain't the Ritz, but they try hard and rooms are clean and you feel safe. For anglos, the desk staff don't always include someone with more than very limited English. Wifi not great and avoid rooms on the forst floor if you're there on a night they have jazz in the restaurant. The restaurant is convenient and great for breakfast (think they stay open fairly late in morning if youre a sleepyhead) - thay even made sure someone made coffee when we had a 6amish departure. We ate there once for dinner, but really found more interesting places…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 February 2012,3,Less than expected,"I stayed only one night at the Le Pietri Urban as I was in Rabat for business. Having looked at the website, I was expecting more. I agree with other reviewers that the location is excellent and the bar and restaurant welcoming. It was my first time at the hotel and, though I would stay again for an overnight, I would definitely keep a few things in mind when making the reservation. I was disappointed with the room. I have stayed in many Moroccan hotels of similar category and have never found one without the usual amenities of a hair dryer and shampoo until I stayed at the Le Pietri. The room was only average. The usual bed, bedside tables, and dressing table, but there was also an unfurnished alcove - I have no idea what that was for. The toilet ran constantly and the room…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 October 2011,5,Excellent hotel,"Great location, close to main train station and within walking distance of all of Rabat's main attractions. Beautiful hotel with modern, tastefully decorated rooms with all the amenities you require. Great adjoining restaurant with yummy, reasonably priced food and great live entertainment. Hospitable and friendly owner and staff who were only too willing to help me with anything I required. Highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Rabat!!",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2012,5,"Perfection, especially if you like jazz","I was in Rabat on a business trip and had the hotel booked for me by my local contact. Excellent central location, five minutes walk from the railway station and the trams. Fifteen minutes walk from the medina down a fine shop-lined C19 French style boulevard. The hotel rightly promotes itself as an 'urban hotel'. No gardens, No balconies. Good modern rooms Great hotel. Very international but with a strong French-Moroccan character. Live jazz in the ground floor restaurant three evenings a week. Very atmospheric to the extent that as a non-smoker I was able to tolerate the cigarettes rapidly extracted by a decent ventilation system. A very good place to which to return",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2012,5,"Jazzy Urban, but an oasis of calm","Le Pietri Urban Hotel in central Rabat - 5 minutes from the main train station, 3 minutes from the new tram line - is on Rue Tobrouk, just off what was called ""Place Pietri"" in French protectorate days. The hotel has a good restaurant, and a very active cultural calendar, with its Jazz Sessions on weekends. The staff is very friendly, and the accent is on value for price. Limited parking right in front of the hotel. I stay here regularly on business trips from Tangier. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Rabat.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 March 2011,3,Location and price can't be beat,"We picked Le Pietri Hotel mostly for the location and price. Although we flew in to Rabat, its practically a stone's throw from the main train station (about 3 blocks). We left Rabat via train so the location was really welcome when you are traveling with bags. We also felt very safe in the location. The neighborhood was nice with several cafe's and pastry shops nearby. It was only a 10 min walk down to the medina. We stayed here again at the end of our trip before flying out of Rabat. The hotel has pretensions of being a really hip, cutting edge place, but the rooms themselves are pretty simple, yet quite comfortable. The room was also spotlessly clean. The bathroom was fine, nice shower, but soaps and shampoos were from dispensers. I'm personally not a big fan…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

 March 2011,4,Great,"You get what you pay for. This is not the Tour Hassan or the Sofitel Diwan. This is an outstanding 3 star hotel. Super location next to the Rabat flower market, smiley and helpful team, standard room is small and simple but is highly functional and well done. Excellent satellite TV. Nice small terrace with wi-fi. One of Rabat's better restaurants. Highly recommend.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 February 2011,5,A wonderful stay - would return tomorrow!,"We spent three nights at Le Pietri and wish we could have stayed longer! Nice modern hotel (room was quiet and comfortable), great breakfasts (""help yourself"" selection included almost everything from scrambled eggs and toast to delicious Moroccan ""pancakes""/breakfast breads and sweet, freshly-squeezed orange juice). By the second night Le Pietri started feeling like our home-from-home. The staff were lovely and very welcoming. Extras worth noting are the free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, free parking in the street in front of the hotel for guests, the excellent restaurant (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and, best of all, the live music sessions on Tuesday nights in the relaxed lounge-bar-restaurant downstairs (great atmosphere) which Le Pietri is well known for. All in all…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2010,4,one towel for two people,"The hotel totally was good: price, place, breakfast. what surprised me - only one towel in a bathroom (in a double room!), and garbage was not taken away. Though the bed was with new linien! strange... the location is very convinient - 5 minutes walk from railway station and 15 min walk from medina",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2010,4,Good short stay,"it's near from railway station in modern area of rabat and 10-15 min walk to Medina. Room and bathroom had good furniture and even live flowers. Not clean - garbage in trash box was full after cleaning. Only one towel for two people in double room, it's typical for all moroccan hotels. Breakfast is ok (fresh orange juce, omlet, bread, tea, coffie, salad). It's not cheap hotel, but if you want to make a pleasure and comfort for you for 1-2 night, it's not bad place.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2010,5,Lovely small hotel in the heart of Rabat,"This was my first trip to Rabat and probably my 10th trip to Morocco. I had been going since the early 1970's. I had not gone for many years. I am so glad I did. First, I very much enjoyed Rabat. Clean, friendly people, wonderful food, etc. Le Pietri Urban Hotel was great. A simple quite oasis in the center of busy Rabat. Wonderful people at the front desk , especially the young receptionist M. Bouchara. Good English, Good French, very helpfull and friendly. The other older woman on the front desk is not a good ""image"" for the hote. Not friendly, no smile, not helpfull. But as we know, when we travel it is sometimes better to ignore these kind of people. So, I always waited until the afternoon when M. Bouchara came on the desk to help me. 24/7 the doormen were…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 November 2010,5,Very friendly place,"Great place, nice and vey friendly staff....fom the cleaner, barman, waiter, to the owner....Great food at pretty decent price....we stayed one night in the suite room then we moved to a normal room, both were clean and agreable, I just wished they had better pillows......Live music on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays is the best, you get to listen to all kinds, Jazz, Blues, Rock......plus nobody bothers you....I will definity go back......one more thing you are at the heart of the city, walking distance to the medina, train station, or you can grab a cab to Rabat's airport..... I remember Bouchra at the reception was of great help to advice you of places to go to. Thanks le Pietri staff for your smile and hard work. and keep smiling :)",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 November 2010,5,So good I'm coming back next week,"Having stayed in most of the major hotels in Rabat, (mainly because Le Pietri was full) we finally managed to get in over Eid al Adha. And very glad we were to do so. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, from the front desk to the waiters, with whom we had many interesting chats about everything from football to Rabat's customs and nightlife. Driss, the owner, was the epitome of a good host and his attempt to turn Le Pietri into the best little hotel in Rabat, if not Morocco, has been acheived as far as we're concerned. The thrice weekly music sessions in the restaurant are just what is needed to liven up one's stay and the food is a great mix of local and international dishes. Keep it up, Driss and the team at Le Pietri, you are on a winner.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 December 2010,1,Had booked for January 2011 but,"Planning my holiday in Marocco for Christmas and New Year, I had book this hotel for the beginning of January 2011. The rate had been agreed and the booking confirmed directly with the hotel. A few days ago I received an e-mail stating that the rate agreed and confirmed was no longer valid. I was then informed that for the 2011 my room was going to cost 8 euros more per day (!!). I did not get the chance to stay at the hotel but, as result of this behavior, I cancelled immediately my booking and I reserved elsewhere. A bit annoying since most of the best rated hotels-riad by then were already full! If you have booked in 2010 for 2011 watch out the rates! I wanted to tell you because I do not want this to happen to other people.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2010,5,Rabat and all that Jazz,"We have spent a great time at the Le Pietri Urban Hotel in Rabat. Nice air conditioned room, great bed and nice breakfast buffet at the terrasse. The restaurant serves a variety of Marrocain but also European dishes and we enjoyed having cocktails while listening to great life Jazz music! The Le Pietri is located close to the train station right in the middle of the center in Rabat. The souk in the medina, the nekropole Chellah and other sights are easy to be visited within walking distance (the hotel gave us a a map and explanation where to go to). The first days of our stay the elevator was busy all the time due to renovation works in the first floor, but luckily they were finished when we left... Everybody was very helpful and friendly and we really enjoyed or stay at the Le…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2010,5,A Little Gem of a Hotel,"I traveled to Rabat with 11 other girlfriends, and we stayed at Le Pietri Hotel. The staff and afternoon desk clerk were friendly, warm, welcoming and a delight to interact with. The bathrooms seemed new. They were very accommodating with our very large group! The restaurant was in a lovely setting, and the food was excellent. I had fresh Calamari that was very tasty. I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Rabat.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 September 2010,5,Wonderful Hotel and Hospitality,"Le Pietri Urban Hotel came through for us from the moment of booking. We started out with a two-room reservation, and little by little ,it swelled to six.. Each time we called to add a room, Bouchra, the lovely lady at the front desk, was willing to do whatever it took to accomodate us. Our rooms were clean and comfortable, and the staff amazing. Even though we arrived quite early in the day, they got our rooms ready as quickly as possible. We enjoyed a wonderful evening meal in the restaurant and a free breakfast as well. What a wonderful mini-vacation right in the center of Rabat for a modest price! We will definitely be returning to this hotel.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 April 2010,4,"Good hotel, value for money, central","This is a very nice and small hotel in Rabat. It is very central in the old french quarter of the city. Rabat's hotels are usually overpriced and quite luxurious, this one, Le Pietri, was just what we were looking for. A small, cosy hotel that is clean and friendly. This is what we got. The rooms are basic, yet clean. There is no double glazzing, so if you get a street-room, it migth get a littl noisy at night. Apart from that, can't say anything negative about the hotel. The restaurant was veryyy good, they have dinner-music evening which was very nice. Howevr, a couple of clashes with the restaurant staff that kind of had their noses stuck up when we went down and asked for a table. We felt a little unwanted for god knows what reason. Asked a waiter, said no sorry, asked…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 March 2010,4,"Trendy, clean, good hotel in great location","We stayed one night in Rabat en route to Fez, and were pleasantly surprised by the Pietri. I'd had problems getting in touch with them through their website and had to call them in the end to make our reservations, but was really glad I persisted. The staff were all friendly, and the hotel was very modern and well-appointed, with an excellent restaurant downstairs (they had a great breakfast, and some of the best tagine we ate the whole time.) The location was by far the best though -- a short, easy walk from the train station, which was great for a short stay. But still close enough to walk through the medina and up to the kasbah in less than an hour. Great location. My only complaint was that the A/C unit on the wall didn't work, it only produced heat. As our room was…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 March 2010,5,Great Hotel - Home away from home,"LePietri is a great hotel to stay at in Rabat. It has the friendliest staff and the best location in the middle of the city where all the action is. It is 3 blocks from the train station and from the main fountain in the promenade park in front of the parlement and the majlis. It is surrended by cafes, restauranrts, convenience stores. It is not far from the night clubs, the flower market, and several high class businesses. It's location makes it easy to get to the medina by foot at any time of the day or night. The staff (and I mean everyone) are the most friendly and helpful people that I have ever seen in a hotel. The small size of the hotel makes even more homy and more alert to customers' needs than the larger more expensive hotels. I was staying at LePietri Hotel…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2010,4,Le Pietri - absolutely great!,"We stayed in this hotel with 12 friends. Rooms not very large, but very comfy. And very clean! The staff is very accurate and very friendly.

 January 2010,5,EXCELLENT ! GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY,"We spent 2 nights in this wonderful hotel . Le Pietri hotel is really the place to stay in Rabat, it offers GREAT value for money, we paid around 70 Euro per night and that includes wonderful breakfast, free WI FI internet inside our room for 24 hours.

 November 2009,4,Nice Stay at the Pietri!,"The location of this is very convenient - very close to the Rabat Ville railway station and the soon to be opened tramway. It is also just a short walk to the Medina and the Kasbah as well as the tomb of the Moroccan kings. The rooms are all very stylish and comfortable. Very tiny TVs but otherwise, decent amount of space all things considered. Bathroom was good sized as well. Not a lot of room for sitting, but we didn't spent too much time in the room. The hotel restaurant was quite good for dinner and the complimentary breakfast was decent as well. The wifi in the hotel was there but it was hit or miss (never worked in the room and lobby was dodgy but signal usually worked in the restaurant).",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 November 2009,1,The hotel had lost our reservation and was full!,The Pietri Hotel is not a hotel you can trust. Over one month before our arrival we made a reservation and received a confirmation from the hotel. At arrival the hotel was full and our reservation was gone. They couldn't even in the computer search and find the reservation name but had to look at _my_ email copies and finally they at least found the reservation.

 July 2009,5,The LePietri guarantees a perfect stay in Rabat.,"When we entered the reception area we were stunned by the high european standard of the hotel. The staff was very (very) friendly and helped us in any kind of situation. They were always available and spoke French and a quite well English, which is not common for Moroccan hotels. When we entered our rooms our expectations were exceeded again. They were very modern, stylish and clean and offered everything you would expect from a european hotel as well. Bed and bathroom were comfortable and the terrace was a highlight! Since i've been there with Friends, we wanted to go out in the evenings. But we didn't come very far, because the best club around is the in-house jazzclub/bar/restaurant of the pietri itself, which seems to be kind of a hot spot for moroccans of every age too. we…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 August 2009,3,Bland interrnational hotel,"The Lonely Planet describes Le Pietri Hotel as ""boutique"". It's not. We stopped off there on the way to Marrakech from Fes. We were please we did since Rabat is less busy and hot than either place. It's about a 10 minute walk from the station so was ideal from our point of view. The rooms need a bit of attention. But it's fine, without really having any character. What really put me off was the bar downstairs. It was full of incredibly drunk locals who were incredibly aggressive. It had live music that went on to about 1am, so don't expect an early night. Still, I guess you get what you pay for - £50 per night for a double room.",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat

All of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We had to change reservations, dates and number of rooms, several times and the front desk was exceptionally accommodating and helpful in working with us. The only problem was availability as they do book up quickly. Additionally, we left a bag during our excursions around the country to pick it up on our return without a problem. The location was good, we easily walked to/from the train station pulling our bags, it was only three or four blocks.

About the hotel: I read the comments about the noise and, being a light sleeper, I decided to go for the room with a Terrace, all the way up. The reservation was fairly efficient. The only glitch I remember is that their price was about 100DH ($12-15$) higher than what is on their website. I inquired about the difference and was sort of told that that was the price, without further explanation. It did throw a bit of a cold as a fist contact but that was the only glitch.

The lobby and the rooms are all furnished in a modern and quirky style, and the bathroom beautiful. I would've expected a hair dryer but there wasn't - and as someone had mentioned, the tv is laughingly tiny. The included breakfast was decent. For its value, the only downside really was the lack of able English speakers at the front desk. There really only seemed to be one that spoke good English.

 December 2008,5,Great music – comfy sleep,"I came to spend some time with friends spread over Morocco. When I told them to meet up in Rabat, they laughed and wanted to gather in Casablanca, persued that it was the best city for going out. Le pietri proved them wrong. We spent a lovely weekend with live bands and great food right at the hotel. Got the chance to meet the manager, who seemed to have a great time himself listening to the group he booked. No wonder the sessions are so enjoyable. The location of the hotel in the center of the town is also very practical for visiting Rabat. We did most of it just walking.

There is no wifi in rooms, only wired access but the hotel will loan you ethernet cables. Breakfast had boiled eggs, crepes, orange juice, breads, jam and butter. Nothing extraordinary but pretty good. Although located about 15 min walk from the train station it is a bit difficult to find.

The staff is friendly and gracious; although the front desk person was multi-tasking much of the time and spoke little English, they were still very nice and helpful.

The place is pretty clean, and it does have an excellent (if a bit pricey - say 15 to 20 Euros for a meal) restaurant, but one normally wants a hotel to sleep in and this is definitely difficult at Le Pietri. The windows are not soundproofed and the rooms on the street are noisy as you can hear people talking, the traffic going by and at four in the morning the dustbins being gathered. The rooms on the courtyard are very quiet except on ....Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays when the Hotel runs lively and very noisy parties with plenty of booze and music until 12.30 a.m. I saw a few other customers leave in a huff in the early hours of the morning complaining about this: on my side, having…",Le_Pietri_Urban_Hotel,Rabat
 January 2008,4,Clean and a good night's sleep!,"Hotel Le Pietri is very close to the train station so that's good and off the main drag. The rooms were sparkling clean and the bathroom too. Definitely worth the money although we were a little disappointed to find that our stay from Dec 31st to January incurred an extra 100 dirham per night into the new year and nobody bothered to tell us so we were left with a bigger bill than expected. Once our booking had been taken by email our further emails were not replied and we were left somewhat puzzled as to whether they wanted our credit card details or not and if we actually had a reservation but it all worked out fine in the end.
