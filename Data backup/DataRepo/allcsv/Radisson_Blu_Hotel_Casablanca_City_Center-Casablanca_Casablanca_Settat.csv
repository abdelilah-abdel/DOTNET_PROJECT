 January 2023,5,Good hotel in a busy city,Overall a good hotel with a nice lobby and restaurant. The room was nice with a nice shower. The toilet which was separate from the bathroom was the only problem as it was so tiny it was difficult to close the door. The breakfast spread was pretty good and had a good selection. We were on the second floor so the noise from the street below was very loud. The fifth floor would be a better choice.,Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Casablanca_City_Center-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,hotelName,city

 September 2021,5,Healthy stay,"I stayed 3 nights at this hotel during pandemic. I felt very safe with cleanness of the hotel room, lobby and the breakfast location. I didn't like the mattress because it was very soft. First after check in the allotted me a room at 11th floor, which had smell of smoke, however the hotel people claim that all the rooms are non smoking. After we complained about it, they allotted me another room within no time. I appreciate them for it and also we reached early before checking time but they provided me the room asap. Thanks also due for that gesture. Overall stay was pleasant and healthy.",Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Casablanca_City_Center-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Casablanca_City_Center,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2021,5,"Excellent stay all round, hard to fault.","The staff were of tremendous help, both Hamza Sabir and Mohamed Manar really could not have been any better. They were attentive and prompt with my requests, nothing was a problem. The room itself was fantastic (Junior suite), the bed was firm without being hard and the shower was powerful and hot. Lastly the breakfast was very good and the choices were more intercontinental than the other hotels I have stayed at in different parts of Morocco (Rabat, Marrakech, Agadir). The only thing missing in my opinion was a lack of USB charging points in the rooms. Nowadays the majority of guests will have multiple items to charge and not enough plug adaptors to cater for them.",Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Casablanca_City_Center-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Casablanca_City_Center,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2021,4,"Good location, great breakfast buffet, tight rooms","We stayed two nights in this well located downtown hotel. The lobby is fairly small, the rooms are very tight as far as room around the bed and places to spread out your luggage, but we liked the fact that the bathroom had an actual shower, instead of a bathtub with a shower, which is much safer as far as falling. We also likedthe fact that the bathroom was in two separate parts. We appreciated the fact that there were three types of glassware in the room, there was one washcloth at least, the mini fridge, and the large TV.

 July 2021,3,Could be a nice place if the manager and staff cared,"We stayed here the month of July on our visit to Morocco. The hotel appears to be in 'fair' shape with the need for better upkeep. It looks like a very nice facility that has recently suffered some neglect, possibly due to the pandemic. PROS: On the plus side- the breakfast was good. They had a lot of good dishes on the breakfast bar and you could get omelets made to order. Crepes were available as well, along with fresh juices. The breakfast was the high point of the stay. CONS: It is the small things that make me think that the manager and staff have lost focus. For example, we wanted to order room service for dinner and the phone didn't work. I went to the desk and told this to the attendant. Instead of indicating that he would fix the phone, he told me to go over to the…",Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Casablanca_City_Center-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Casablanca_City_Center,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The location is convenient to the sights at the old medina, the Hassan 2 Mosque, and the Corniche. Beds are firm, with a firm and soft pillow provided.

USB outlet didn’t work, and they didn’t have adapters for US-style plugs (this was not an issue at any other place we stayed in in Morocco- including a camp in the Sahara). 3. Housekeeping knocked in the door and entered the room without confirmation at 10:30pm for no apparent reason. 4. Hotel faces some dinky apartment buildings.
