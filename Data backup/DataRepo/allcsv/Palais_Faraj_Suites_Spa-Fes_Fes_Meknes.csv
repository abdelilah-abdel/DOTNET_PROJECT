 January 2023,4,Lovely stay,"We stayed three nights and were impressed by how beautiful this hotel is. Views from the terrace are absolutely beautiful. We liked our rooms very much (stayed two nights in a suite then in a regular one as the suite wasn’t available). Breakfast is buffet and really good. We also had lunch and dinner and were pleased with the quality of the food. Staff was very friendly however service was pretty slow (bars, restaurants, room service and in room requests).

It is therefore very easy to visit the old city of Fes without any problem (we although highly recommend a guide as this Medina is huge and it is very difficult to find your way!). The view on the Medina from the hotel is AMAZING, the food of the restaurant is delicious with plenty of choice and a variety of options (both internationals/mediterraneans and moroccans), the staff is also very welcoming and is ready to satisfy any type of requests.

Just hands down bravo to the whole team at Palais Faraj and l’Amandier restaurant in particular for providing such an excellent experience. To see the old Medina from this point of view and to experience the imperial city, the Palais Faraj way, reignited my love for the city of Fes. For the food itself, the wait time was very fair (actually you don’t even feel the time pass there) and when it arrived every bite was impeccable and full of taste.

This is a nice hotel right on the edge of the Medina. You are close, but you won’t get lost trying to find your hotel unlike those in the Medina.

Most authentic Moroccan experience we could have. It is listed as a 5 Star property and the manager tries very hard to make certain all is well., but they aren’t quite a 5 star.We did have a package delivered to the hotel and had laundry service.

The décor in the public areas and the patios is really a feast for the eyes. We stayed in an Ambassador Suite, which was nice, but had a couple issues. The best thing was that it had a full bath and a powder room. The worst thing was that the full bath was small and extremely hot because of poor/no ventilation. Plugs - or the lack of - were an issue throughout and we only found one that was accessible in the whole suite.

We also chose this hotel as it offers free parking on its grounds and at the same time it is only a few steps away from the old town.

This beautifully appointed riyad combines the best of modern decor juxtaposed with artfully installed and beautifully hand crafted traditional mosaic tiles. Most rooms seem to overlook the main courtyard and pretty azure tiled swimming pool.

It is NOT small, dainty, authentic nor exudes a residents feeling, so expect also quite a lot more travellers around you, sometimes even larger groups.

The staff quickly reached our to their resident doctor who saw my husband in our room within 20 minutes of our call.

At check-in, it was noted that there was a quite animated ""discussion"" between another quest and a member of staff. Moments before leaving for our tour of the city the next morning, we were told we had to change rooms. Not a big problem, but we were embarrassed to make our fellow travellers wait half an hour while we repacked.

We had dinner in the restaurant both nights and breakfast twice. The food and service were both excellent. There are some not good things. The place is extremely expensive and the price is not justified. The view from the suite was nice but not compelling. For the first night, they told us that a/c was not available despite the 86 degree outside temperature. The desk man who took us to our room said “the night is cool”. It wasn’t.

We were graciously upgraded to an Ambassador suite the following day which was also spacious and tastefully decorated and we did not feel that the furniture was worn as some reviewers had mentioned.

It was not us who made that mess and we found out on our check out day so we have been using a dirty toilet for two days.

Upon our arrival, we were escorted to room #2, which from the start was odd and not at all what we expected. The entre to the room was a dangerous and dark spiral staircase that ended in the closet area of a tiny, non-functional sitting room. There was no door between the closet area and the stairs, which felt simply unsafe as it was an open, dark and drafty space just part of the room. Yikes!

 March 2019,1,Yarrawood,During my first meal at this hotel I discovered a large blow fly emerging from the middle of my food. Unfortunately I had already eaten half of this meal. I was repulsed. The following day I became very ill. I am still suffering the effects of this incident. After complaining to restaurant staff the next morning I expected the management would contact me.

 April 2019,5,Luxury hotel,Rooms are beautiful and very welcoming. Very clean !! Which is very important to me and some reviewers said otherwise. We booked one hamam suite and double room both of were great and clean . Service from reception was super helpful and patient. Helped us find good restaurants and attractions.

 March 2019,2,New Management Is Needed ASAp,"This hotel has the potential to be a great hotel to visit. Unfortunately, the management of the hotel starting with the General Manager is incompetent. Service is what a hotel should provide. This is sadly lacking here. If not for the help of another travel agency who gave us one of their upgraded rooms I shudder to think of what my stay would have been like.

 February 2019,4,Wonderful Riad,"Upon entering this incredible Riad one can see that it was once the home of some very important people. The hotel has separate wings and tile everywhere! Our room had a daybed tucked away under a carved wooden ceiling with gorgeous painting. So fantastic that I laid my head down and feel asleep tonthe breeze coming through the window. There were a few things that I would change such as having the availability of air conditioning even in cooler month as it can get stuffy, but we opened a window!

The bathroom was exceptional and the bed was incredibly comfortable (which was important after a long drive!). The staff at the riad were extremely thoughtful and courteous. The women working in reception were very helpful and the manager was very much present to make sure everything was perfect! Before retiring for the evening, I asked at the front desk for a couple of cookies. Less than ten minutes later, someone came to our door with a plate full of cookies! Wow! The dinner in the restaurant was one of the best we had in Morocco! The service was excellent and the view is stunning!

The first night our room did not have turn down service . When I called the front desk I was told they didn’t do turn down service . However the second night we received turn down service but not the third night . The management did not care .

 March 2019,4,"5 stars if you require elevator, 3 stars if you do not","A disclaimer: we stayed at Palais Faraj for one night after staying 2 nights in another Riad in Fes which we absolutely loved. Therefore Palais is suffering from being compared to one of the best places we stayed in Morocco. That said, we rented two rooms: ambassador suite and a triple suite for a family of 6 ( 4 kids). Both rooms were big and had modern amenities. They were on the second floor which is easily reached by elevator. The same elevator services rooftop restoring. To be honest, elevator is the best part of the hotel as most of the Riads have steep stairs which make life impossible for some people.

I booked in this hotel and they offered FREE GUIDE for the city sightseeing, it was amazing and very good to have a guide for FREE, but it's terrible to discover that the guide is for FREE because they take commissions from anything you buy and even when you have lunch in the Medina (not sure if it's their restaurant but they price is higher, the guide had lunch for free + he take some coins), we bought a fake carpet and with more then double price because the gudie take commission for the Hotel and himself!!

Palais Faraj, we selected after reviews but it’s a share disappointment - elevator was not working and they made us climb 3 floors multiple times a day with young kids. The internet was almost not there and our suite has air con issues - no matter, if remains warm. The staff tried to fix things and they are nice, but entire Morocco ppl are nice so what’s the big deal. The Moorish color and building style may attract visitors but at hotel, what matters is service standards. Food, in BF is just average, dinner was better on roof top.

Great location overlooking the medina - with spectacular early sunrises and sunsets. Beautifully restored atmospheric suites (tho if you're a light sleeper you may have to forgo the view for a bit of quiet). Generally good food - breakfast was a standout - with quality Moroccan cuisine in the evening. Nice bar. Spa was a bit amateurish - but fun. Staff overall were well intentioned - if a bit inefficient and inexperienced - slow to respond to (and poor understanding of ) requests.

She's a jewel who's a credit to this wonderful place.

One onsite restaurant doubles for both breakfast & dinner meals. Food quality was “acceptable”. Only visited the spa for a pedicure which was very ordinary at best. That said, the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, if visiting Fes again, we would return to this same hotel, it’s an experience.

On arriving at the grand Palais Faraj I instantly felt I was in for a treat, from the grandness of the hotel to the beautiful design. The door men at the front gate was so helpful and feel that they should be acknowledged. From helping with the luggage to making sure I knew where I was going they are so helpful.

It’s located at the top of a hill so the view overlooking the Medina is beautiful. We had a sitting room in addition to the bedroom and 2 bathrooms (1 was a powder room). The bed was very comfortable. We were able to hear the early morning call to prayer every day. The daily breakfast buffet was very nice - it includes hot food too. We had dinner two out of the 3 nights in the hotel - it was average. It was very nice being able to sit outside when it was raining in the outer covered perimeter of the inner courtyard.

The live music in the bar was so loud conversation was impossible, the pool area was mostly in shade (possibly due to the time of year) and unheated, although beautifully set. The spa was also beautiful but one therapist was great and the other provided a very inferior service. We think she may have had a problem with massaging a young, attractive male!

 May 2018,4,Unexpected,"Clean, comfortable and stylish describes the rooms and property. The lobby and other areas give you the feel of being in an actual palace. The walkways to some of the rooms are through gardens. Our room was spacious, comfortable. There is a separate sitting area with couches, end and coffee tables, and a TV. The bedroom was spacious with a doorway to an outside sitting area, a desk, dressing table, closet, and another TV. The toilet was in its own separate room. The bathroom was large with a tub/shower, bidet and sink and is nicely appointed. Breakfast and dinner were buffets that had enough choice for western appetites. A surprise in Fez.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,4,Beautiful and calm,"The public areas of this hotel are just beautiful, and our room was extremely comfortable and well appointed. We thought the location was ideal - outside the medina walls but an easy walk to all the tourist areas. After going to the souks, which were apparently suffering some sort of garbage strike or dispute, it was a relief to get away from the piles of refuse and enjoy the quiet at the hotel. Service was mixed. A couple of the front desk personnel were friendly, others were not. One of the ladies working at the breakfast buffet was very kind and helpful, while the bartenders were stony faced and aloof. We did appreciate the airport transfer service.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Superb oasis in Fes,"We spent 2 memorable nights at this palatial riad in Fes during our Morocco Expert Tour vacation. Our Suite was regal and well appointed with expensive furnishings, rugs, comfortable beautiful bed and bathroom furnishings. Climate control was excellent and the superb breakfast buffet was the best we had in Morocco (terrific variety and very tasty). Our room service (Morocco soup) experience was excellent at a MOST reasonable cost, including many appetizing extras. No fitness facility was available (like all our accommodations in Morocco) though spa facilities were reported excellent (we didn't utilize). Not easily accessible to the Medina (required a drive). Service was excellent. Would love to stay here again next visit to Fes!",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Comfort and style,The Palais Faraj is worth the visit for the beautyof the public rooms and the exterior setting. Our ambassador suite was tastefully decorated and extremely comfortable.

 November 2017,5,One of the best in Morocco,"The Palais Faraj was one of our nicest stays while touring Morocco. The suites are superbly decorated in traditional tiles and ornate carving. The bed was comfortable and in general the suite was faultless. Like most suites we had on this trip our room was two storey. There are 2 restaurants serving traditional Moroccan and Western fare. We ate there for all of the 4 nights of our stay. The wine list was a little limited but you will find this all through Morocco. Nothing wrong with that though, the local wines are great.

 March 2018,2,Mediocre would be kind,"We stayed here 2 nights. The room was not clean, found bits of garbage in the corners of the room and the floor was clearly dirty if you picked up anything from the floor. Though the halls were freezing-doors are left open- the room itself was stuffy. We were across the hall from an elevator that squealed and was clearly audible in our room. Fortunately it was not used much after midnight. And worst of all the food in the restaurant, both for breakfast and the one night we ate there was atrocious.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2018,3,Poor service,"The hotel is beautiful, but the service is pathetic. We were overcharged while checking out and when we pointed it out to the reception, he was rude and defensive.

You could slap ""Four Seasons"" or ""Ritz"" in front of the name and I'd believe it. Now, that's not to say that it isn't a beautiful hotel. The rooms are comfortable. The courtyard is stunning and the design and grounds are truly beautiful and they have and nice hammam with actual steam. They do serve alcohol as well, which many places do not.

 March 2018,5,Gorgeous quiet luxurious hotel in perfect location at Medina wall,"We chose Palais Faraj due to its TripAdvisor ratings and 2018 Travelers Choice award, and it’s reasonable price. We were delighted. Palais Faraj is located steps outside the wall of the old Medina and is therefore convenient both to the outside (Ie cars taxis airport etc) and to the Medina (your guide will pick you up at the hotel and you just walk in; no need to drive there). The hotel is gorgeous in every way. From the subtly lighted external wall, gate, and crennalated exterior, to the surrounding gardens, and the VIEW! The hotel interior is exquisite and appointed with carpets, art, and antique furniture. The interior courtyard is large and comfortable (upper level patio and lower level pool).

 December 2017,4,Nice Stay,"We stayed at Faraj over the holidays and found the property to be absolutely gorgeous, with its tranquil courtyards and beautiful tile work. The front desk staff is very helpful and really the only place you’ll find some decent English speakers. The staff was kind enough to upgrade us to a larger suite at check-in, which was nice, although it was right by the pool and caught quite a bit of noise from passers-by. The hotel offers to reserve several tours for you but be sure to ask for details on what’s included so you’re not caught off guard. Our only real complaint was about the spa. It seems understaffed - for one appointment, we showed up to check in, and no one greeted us for almost 10 mins.

Dinner and breakfast at the award wining restaurant was first rate, as were drinks in the bar with a to die for view of the city. The staff treated us with great warmth and professionalism.

The rooms are clean, spacious, with daylight through the windows, and everywhere you look you'll see the beautiful mix of authentic Moorish architecture with contemporary design and modern touches. The breakfast and dinner are delicious and various. You can order typical Moroccan dinner at the L'Amandier restaurant, an award winning restaurant and therefore the best in Fes!

 July 2017,5,Definitely stay at Palais Faraj!,"While other hotels try to imitate Moroccan charm, Palais Faraj is authentic. From the moment you arrive, the decor is wonderful. From the exterior architecture, interior tiles, hallway artifacts or rugs & wall hangings in the rooms, you know you are in Morocco. The management has obvious class and a great sense of design, combining luxury accommodations with great ambiance. And the rooftop dining outside on the terrace, overlooking the city, is an experience not to be missed. The same area, with indoor dining also available, serves a hearty breakfast in the morning.

The rooms are lavishly decorated with the most incredible mosaics and paintings and the courtyard of the hotel is simply splendid. The rooms are spacious and the buffet breakfast is delicious.

At approximately 2500 MAD per night, the price was extremely reasonable. This boutique hotel, located at the foot of the Fez medina, is an oasis from the chaotic hustle and bustle of Fez. Our room had a very large terrace, and opened out over the Fez medina, offering us breathtaking views of the sprawl below. It was always a relief to come back to the hotel and take off our shoes and relax, after a day of navigating the souks and brushing off the touts that are so ubiquitous in any major Moroccan city. The L'Amandier restaurant is about what'd you expect from fine dining in Morocco, but nothing special - that having been said, we didn't try the degustation menu, so maybe that would have wowed…",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes

This riad was unique in that it had intricate doorways and hallways that led to different areas in the hotel which made it mysterious, as all of Fes was. Staff was very friendly and the hotel was quiet which often made it seem like it was our own riad without any other guests there. Food was good but I would stay away from the eggs at breakfast.

The staff are friendly and efficient and we had a very enjoyable stay with no problems at all. It has the reputation of being one of the top hotels in Fes and it's where visiting VIPs stay. While we were there, there was also staying the president of an African country and his entourage, which meant there was lots of extra security, but this didn't detract from our visit at all. On the contrary, we have every reason to be grateful to the wonderful owner, Driss Faceh, who was able to arrange for us to see the Qarawiyyin library and archives.

Amenities were great; food was delicious and the Hammam (Turkish bath) I had in the spa was so relaxing and rejuvenating. I went straight to bed after it and slept like a baby until the morning call to prayer which you hear almost everywhere in a Muslim country.

 July 2017,5,Perfect proposal,"We initially chose a hotel within the old medina but our Moroccan friend recommended the Palais Faraj instead. Once we arrived, we understood immediately why he chose it. The hotel is a five minute drive outside the medina gates with a private and secure lot, whereas cars are not allowed within the old medina. It was easy to find, compared to places within the medina which is like a maze. The medina is amazing but can be overwhelming, and the Palais Faraj provided an oasis of calm, beauty, (and air conditioning!!) The rooms were enormous with intricately tiled floors. The rooftop restaurant and bar had stunning views of Fes and excellent food and drink. (Daniel Silva actually describes a room and the bar in his new novel ""House of Spies."")

The amenities are modern while the owner has taken the time to maintain old world decor and even refurbished lot of cedar work and wood from the past. The library where I spent some time is worth a visit and taking time to enjoy. It is very well done. The views form the terrace are appealing.

 July 2017,3,Great room but expectations not met.,"We stayed for 3 nights in a superb and well appointed ""Royal"" suite with unsurpassed views. So it should have been for $A1,640 per night. We ""frocked up"" to visit the bar for pre dinner drinks. What a disappointment. Yes, great views, but with NO dress code at all we encountered , on both nights, people in thongs, shorts and T shirts taking up prime window positions, slumped over I Pads taking no note of anything else.

We were picked up from the airport by a hotel transfer driver and it all carried on smoothly thought our three night stay. The hotel has unique charm of the old Palace with modern facilities, filled with colourful mosaics. We were upgraded on our arrival and given an ambassador suite but kindly declined it to get a room with two single beds in Junior Suite, which was equally specious and had amazing views both of the courtyard with the swimming pool as well as amazing views of the city and the mountains.

 June 2017,5,I wasn't going to do a review,Because they already have so many 5 stars but they deserve to be recognized Views of the city are fantastic. Like going back in time because it was an old palace that was restored. One of my favorite things is that the owner is so hands on. He is always around which def keeps the staff on their feet Amazing buffet breakfast included I loved being a bit outside the medina. I like the riads but my American side needs the comforts of a real hotel such as food when I want it which really is not offered at riads.,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2017,5,"Great hotel, best restaurant","During our week-plus long trip this was both our favorite hotel and our favorite restaurant. The food was the best we had in Morocco! We ate dinner at the rooftop restaurant twice and all their moroccan signature dishes (lamb shank, tagine, moroccan salads) were excellent. The restaurant also served a very good breakfast buffet (included) with fresh moroccan pancakes and eggs. The staff was great and very helpful in arranging a car service for a day trip to volubilis and with other logistical issues. The pool was nice and they served beer and tea poolside. The location was ok, with about a 10-15 minute walk (or 10 dirham taxi ride) to the Blue Gate. I would highly recommend the Palais Faraj. In general, we really liked Fes.

We were initially impressed by the seemingly lavish accommodations when we arrived, and the tall, polite concierge who greeted us was very friendly. We thought we had lucked out. We did notice some issues: Our bathroom had wall cutouts from the tilework and boarded up with painted wood, which was not pleasant to the eye, but the rooms were neat and clean. Bathroom ventilation was also quite weak and useless.

Comfort and high levels of service are a must. We stayed 8 nights at this enchanting location and we used it as a base to make few day trips to Ifran and Meknes. Palais Faraj has exceeded our high expectations. The welcome, the upgrade to ambassadeur suite, the attention to detail and kindness of the staff and the shear stop at nothing to make your stay enjoyable made the experience unforgettable.

When we checked out I paid for our restaurant bill. It was supposed to be 575 Dirham and they mistakenly charged my card 775, and I signed it without looking and we left. They noticed the error and refunded the 775 and just charged me the 575 on their own - without me calling or anything - and I likely would never have noticed had I not seen the charge and reversal of the charge on my credit card bill. Now, about the hotel itself. The rooms are large and luxurious, comfortable and clean. Make sure you go to the roof top outside the restaurant - the view is amazing.

 August 2016,4,Bit of luxury,I had a great time here. Really nice rooms. Amazing view over medina. And its perfect for you if you don't mind a short 5 min taxi to the gate of the ancient medina. The hammam was nice and the pool great to soak after a day in the sun. Staff very friendly and helpful. Its a luxury joint and I enjoyed it. However I also stayed in the Medina and had a completely different family experience.. Which felt more authentic of course.

The massage was awesome as well. The dinner and breakfast here were incredible. The dinner was probably one of the best meals I've had in all of Fes. After dinner we went to the bar.

It has been beautifully refurbished keeping the style and ambience of its former glories whilst providing modern comforts. The location is fantastic situated just outside the Old City which is absolutely mesmeric and in my view Fes is far better than Marrakesh and it really feels you are stepping back into medieval times when wiling the day away in the Old City.

 June 2016,1,Major disappointment,"The place is beautiful including room, ground, pool and spa. The workers at the front desk were poor communicators and had no authority if something went wrong. We booked a trip to the caves through the hotel and after a 3 hour drive to the caves we discovered it had been closed for the past month due to an accident in the cave. We felt the hotel should have known about the closure prior to us wasting 7 hours of our vacation. Furthermore our bill was incorrect and we had to spend 3 hours at the desk the night before leaving to resolve it.

 April 2016,5,Stunning property,"The hotel is located just outside the Fez Medina. Our room was beautiful, meticulously decorated with Moroccan tiles and carvings. The public areas are lovely as well. Breakfast was excellent. My only complaint was that we had some issues with the front desk staff--our room was not cleaned one day because the front desk thought we had checked out (although our room was prepaid for that night) and they never communicated our request for ice from the bar staff.

Our room, #12, was a large spacious suite of rooms with a view to die for. The bedding was so luxurious and comfortable, best nights sleep on the trip so far. They arranged a guide for us in the Medina, and he made the trip so special. Breakfasts are the best - lots of fresh fruits, try the eggs Khili, and try some harissa with it. The pastries are to die for. Deep hot coffee - so good. The bar is nice but very smokey - not used to that coming from the US. Fresh air would be good in there.

But internet connection was basically non existent. We were told we would have better wifi in a different room so we packed up to move.

There were also a number of small old-fashioned salons and courtyards inside, even a library. The whole hotel is a beautiful blend of Moroccan and Western design. The terrace has an incredible view of all of the Fes medina. This is still a boutique hotel (only about 25 rooms) so you can find space to yourself. * We stayed in a Junior Suite.

Personally I enjoyed walking around in Fes, but had a hard time with the cleanliness of the hotels and restaurants.

I have seen very few hotels where check-ins and check-outs are so smooth. The roof top restaurant is also quite nice, with an extremely nice view of the city.

 October 2015,5,"Beautiful Hotel, Safe, Secure, Authentic","Palais Faraj's greeting was warm and friendly it was after 10pm and we were still offered dinner as we had not eaten on our flight from Paris. We were taken to the Restaurant and our Suite was upgraded. The Suite was amazing with a full size modular lounge, mini bar and wonderful Moroccan furnishings. The bedroom had a king size comfortable bed again beautifully decorated. Lastly the marble bathroom had a bath as well as a shower and generous vanity. Palais Faraj has wonderful communal spaces to rest and relax either indoors or outdoors , the pool was clear and sparkling clean and I was impressed with every inch of the property. The tour guide provided by the hotel was friendly and informative, if your not visiting the Medina to shop I would suggest you be up front with the…",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2015,5,"spectacular, from the pool to the service","Perhaps the most beautiful hotel we have every stayed in. Once we saw the hotel, we wished that we had planned to spend more time relaxing in the hotel rather than touring Fez. We managed to swim in the infinity pool, which was absolutely amazing. Dinner was delicious. We forgot our travel adapters, and the hotel provided us with travel adapters immediately. We were there during the ""festival of the sheep,"" and I needed my clothes to be laundered before we checked out early the next morning. Even though it was a holiday, they were able to rush launder my clothes at no extra charge within a few hours, and did a great job of getting out the stains. The only possible downside is that the hotel is located a bit outside of the fes medina (maybe a 10 minute drive), but it was not a…",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2015,5,Impeccable,"Absolutely my favorite place I have ever stayed! The attention to detail was amazing. We had a little raid inside the hotel near the library. It had a court yard with a fountain, a sitting room with a tv, a bathroom and upstairs there was two beautiful rooms each with there own bathroom. Breath taking how beautiful. The pool was great for relaxing at. The spa was amazing. Our daughter met someone very famous that was staying there but I won't say who ;) We ate every meal there and it was delicious every time. We only wished they had a little more selection for the room service menu, that our tour guide we had hired through the hotel was a little bit better and that the wifi in our room was better.

 September 2015,5,What more to add?,"Just read the reviews of this hotel, and you will realize that no more room has been left for you. I shall not use traditional star rating to describe this hotel, but rather the feeling you get when you are surrounded with all this Moroccan art. Excellent room, very nice location, great breakfast, and all supported by friendly staff. What else you need to relax? Don’t expect too much of WiFi, as it seems a generic problem in Morocco, I stayed in room # 5, and would advise the Management to ventilate more frequently",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2015,5,Truly a five star hotel,"I had a fantastic stay at the Palais Faraj, everything exceeded my expectations. Quite possibly the best hotels I've stayed in yet. The suites are amazing, the design is great, the staff attentive and the views from the Restauraunt will take your breath away. It's quite difficult to hail a cab outside, but the staff are more than happy to help.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2015,5,Unreal. One of the most beautiful hotels I've ever seen.,"This is one of those places that I will always remember as one of the nicest hotels I've ever experienced. When you first walk in, you can't believe that it's hotel because it is so ornate and beautiful. Everything worked flawlessly there. We would spend afternoons on the patio - swimming and relaxing after seeing Fes.

 August 2015,5,Hospitality at it's best,"This gem is perfectly located close to the old town yet away from the noisy quarters. There are some really nice views and stunning old fashioned interior decorations. The patio is relaxing and the hospitality first class. You live part of the history of Fes just being here. What I most loved about this place though is that the food is delicious and typically Moroccan at a very reasonable price which is, in my experience, a first that contrasts with other overpriced hotel foods. There is a coffee machine and generous bottles of free water as well as a free mini bar.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2015,5,Stunning,"The suite was heaven after spending the previous day riding camels and sleeping in tents (albeit exceptional tents). The rooms were large and filled with all of the elements and details of fine Moroccan architecture. Beautiful carved woodwork covered the rooms. The colors were vibrant and tasteful. The bathroom was large and bright with good lighting. The top floor bar and outdoor dining were spectacular and quite welcome after a day of touring. The stairways were potentially dangerous due to limited to no lighting and uneven steps. The staff during breakfast were somewhat slow and seemed inexperienced. However, the overall experience of the hotel overcame these negatives.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2015,5,A Palace in Fez,"WOW. This place is over the top. If you are looking for world class luxury in the middle of Morocco, look no further. My family of three stayed here two nights and never wanted to leave. Besides the great food (reviewed elsewhere), this place pays attention to details. Our room was a two bedroom suite, THREE bathrooms, two showers, living room, closet and foyer. We got lost in the room. The song Beverly Hills refers to “cleaning the spaces in between.” That describes the service. The cleaning staff left no corner untouched. Beds were comfy, with feather pillows, good views and excellent décor. The property was also a work of art. The courtyard was spotless and comfy.

The bag had both our passports and cash inside. The staff at the hotel were very understanding of our terrible situation and when we did arrive with our emergency passports, the hotel managed to cheer us up with an upgrade to their Royal Suite. Just amazing. This was not where their superb service stopped, they were always helpful and nothing was ever too difficult. We only got to stay two nights but it was truly amazing.

It has spectacular views. As expected for a converted/ repurposed older structure, the room configurations are varied, but well appointed. It has a peaceful central courtyard, nice pool and several relaxing salons. The rooftop bar and restaurant are nice. Order the Coteaux De L'Atlas wines.

 June 2015,5,A true palace,"Palais Faraj made our visit to Fes unforgettable. The hotel has a characteristic charm about it, a soul you don't often find on holiday, not even in the leading hotels of the world. Somehow the architect and designer have been able to marry tradition with modernity and originality, as the hotel offers all the luxury and technology available while keeping in touch with human proportions and the need for a unique experience. We were welcomed and pampered by lovely staff, capable of indulging all our needs and desires. The rooms are wonderful and utterly comfortable. We enjoyed delicious meals in restaurant L'Amandier.

 May 2015,4,"Excellent hammam, beautiful courtyard, subpar food","My friend and I had a few extra hours in Fes and after wandering through the medina for 24 hours we were ready to get clean. The spa package of hammam, massage and pedicure seemed right for us. It was 3 hours of luxury. With soft robes, professional staff, dim lighting and serene atmosphere. The pedicure and manicure was unlike any other I had before, we were laying down and it was quite an awkward position. We then tried to get a bite to eat in the restaurant. It was not open for dinner yet, but they seated us and gave us a dinner menu and a snacks menu then to explain that we could only order off the one menu. It was not great. The service was odd and not very good.

Had a tour of the hotel from Mr Otterman who is the sales manager he explained in perfect English the history behind the hotel.

Our room was a spacious apartment-like layout with large sitting room, bedroom, glorious dressing room (with more than ample closet and drawer space) as well as a beautiful bath.

Prior to our meal, my husband was feeling very tired and weak from not eating very much during the day. Halfway through our meal, he felt very ill and needed to lie down. (I want to be clear that he DID NOT feel ill because of the food we ate here). There were many attentive, friendly staff who were willing to help; finding him a place to lie down, providing him with sugar water and bread, and calling a car to drive us back to the Riad. In total, I can recall a minimum of 4 different staff members helping him. During our short visit, I can honestly say that the dining staff is professional and kind, and we could not have asked for a more attentive response to our troubles.

The facility itself is quite lovely with wonderful views. The breakfast is top notch and contrary to other visitors, we did not have trouble with English, nor did we feel like second class citizens being English speakers. We ate dinner here and it was excellent and plentiful, but by the time I got to Fes I was beginning to get tired of the same chicken dishes with the same sauces and same spices. A little variety would have been nice. They are not conversant with gluten free, but they did try hard to accommodate my dietary restrictions. WiFi was just fine.

The only comparable hotels to this one in layout and in decor are in India. This is a stunning small hotel. I think of it as a small Oberoi Udavillas. The service is not quite on the level of Oberoi and the small touches are not either. For example, the wifi was very iffy depending on where you were on the property and service was good but not great. Yet, we were happily surprised to stay at this property for two nights while in Fes. As a note, the restaurant had some of the best food we had in Morocco.

But the check in was average and normal like in most average hotels and a welcome drink was not offered. Then we have got shown our room which was too dark. The light was almost not bright enough for reading newspapers. The bathroom has had a mouldy moisty smell out of water pipes. The TV size is small and not up to date because you will need 2 remote controls to watch TV. The next problem is that you will be unable to know how to use and to start it because nobody has given us instructions and there was no user manual.

 November 2014,3,5 Star Looking Hotel BUT Service & Comfort is Seriously Lacking (Starwood Platinum),"My wife and I finished up our 12 day stay in Morocco at this beautiful hotel for three nights. We quickly found out that the hotel was in a location not immediate to any attractions or shopping. Walking was far and not through ideal neighborhoods. Taxi rides would be highly encouraged. We were also very surprised to learn that while the temperatures were in the 70s the hotel had already switched to winter mode which meant no air conditioning! Not ideal for a hotel situated on top of a hill in the sun! Hot, hot, hot in the room! The views were breathtaking.

 November 2014,4,Good but service a little lacking,"Pleasant hotel with great views over the old medina. Open terrace, bar and restaurant offer enjoyable facilities. Other public rooms a bit soul-less. Staff were all pleasant but only one (Mohammed the maitre d' at breakfast and lunch exuded the joy of service). Rooms are individual and quirky with several small roomettes within the bathrooms. Beds are large and very comfortable with fine linens. I needed to change rooms after half a day as doors were banged very frequently during the afternoon, believed to be staff actions. My room was changed without fuss. The new suite was reached up a spiral staircase,a little larger than the first but had only one tiny window. The sitting area had two windows with doors separating the two.

We were met by the manager & his staff who welcomed us warmly, served us Moroccan hospitality hot tea & cookies, took our luggages & escorted us to our rooms. The Ambassadeur suite was beautiful, spacious & clean. We all got different types of rooms but each one of us loved what we got. The decor made me feel like I was in an Arabian fantasy. We had a powder room, walk-in closet, living room, bedroom & a main bathroom with separate shower & tub. There were fresh fruits, cookies & dates on the coffee table. Wifi was reliable & free.

 October 2014,5,"Luxurious, friendly, professional","I traveled around Morocco in October 2014 with my friend with rented car for about 10 dyas. Fez was a very challenging place and the first few hours spent at Fez turned out to be very difficult. We could not find Riad that we booked online and seemed that no one was able to help us and people (as Moroccans often are) by trying to be helpful they were in fact extremely pushy, laud, pulling us around and made us at the end tired, desperate and totally exhausted. We decided to stop at Palais Faraj to ask for some help and extremely friendly and professional receptionist called Zakaria helped us to find our Riad and booked us transport that took us to that place.

 October 2014,5,An oasis of luxury,"After an arduous 4 days of travelling between Marrakech and Fes, walking into the Palais Faraj courtyard and eventually our room was the most magical experience. The hotel itself is beautiful and so luxurious - particularly compared to its surroundings! The room (junior suite) was incredibly spacious and comfortable considering it was the least expensive on offer. We also enjoyed the in-room dining - great burger and club sandwiches! This was the only hammam I visited in Morocco so I have nothing to compare it with but it was a wonderfully relaxing experience. I would visit Morocco again purely to stay in this hotel.

We asked for a guide to take us through the Medina, and they contacted ""Momo"". I'll review him somewhere else if I can find a place as he was spectacular. Ask for him if you need a guide. The hotel bar overlooks the entire medina and is current in style, service and music. They have a lovely restaurant with the same view. Our room was simply divine - scroll work plaster everywhere, tile inlay floors, huge bathroom, king size comfortable bed, separate sitting area with a welcome tray of food (and we had one of the least expensive rooms).

Always kept immaculately clean. And all exquisitely designed and furnished in traditional moroccan style, and overlooking a sizeable pool, again in a lovely courtyard setting.

The wood painted ceilings and tiled walls just outstanding. Ours was a two-story suite unbelievable, facing the pool. The food was excellent. The reception staff very helpful, We needed a memory stick for our camera and the hotel driver took us to buy it. Also picked us up at a restaurant one time we dined out.

The best part of our stay was the staff and especially one of the managers, Kevin, who was very accommodating and had a great sense of humour.

How lucky for us! This was a totally gorgeous hotel, with every room a little different. We had a deluxe suite (not sure...) --whatever it was called, it was so beautiful. Our room looked onto the pool and than over the wall to the medina. The layout of the room, with a comfortable living area and a lovely bedroom and bathroom, were so nice. I think the hotel has around 25 rooms. It exudes a quiet luxury, and you can see how beautiful it must have been as a palace in its' former life.

Well, at least the manager told me this as we checked in! It is a grand Riad (traditional Moroccan house) with modern conveniences. Like most riads turned guest houses or hotels, the pool is usually small compared to ""western"" style hotels like the Sofitel or Hyatt. However, Palais Faraj Suites and Spa is in itself the reason for being in Fes. The breakfast was amazing, a range of cold meats, breads, cakes and cooked tagine eggs! Check in was swift and elegant!

 August 2014,5,Calm and luxurious hotel looking over the Medina,"Palais Farah is on a hill just above the main part of the Medina, built into a part of the wall. The rooms are exquisitely finished. Our room for three was a suite with a large living room. The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. Nasser was extremely welcoming but also realised that arriving late after a long drive we wanted to get settled in quickly. The restaurant has a fabulous view, but not that it only has around 10 tables on the open air terrace, so it is worth reserving. The pool is beautiful and good size, but the mosaic tiles are rather sharp and cut my son's fingers. I am pleased we took this option rather than staying in the Medina itself, in fact, we met a couple of refugees from the Medina to the calm and comfort of the hotel.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes

We were surprised that not more guests did so. The lobby is generous and adjacent to a lovely inner courtyard, both with comfortable seating spaces. We stayed at Palais Faraj while attending the Fes International Festival of Sacred Music this year.

The rooms are really beautifully decorated in Moroccan style and spacious; mine overlooked the swimming pool area, but I'm sure there are rooms with views of the medina. Speaking of views - the restaurant and bar on the top floor offer spectacular views of the city - so I enjoyed wonderful breakfasts and dinners on the terrace. the spa is good - I had a very good hammam.

I had a bad experience with the guy in reception when I decided not to go to his suggested restaurant and asked him to make dinner reservation some where else. He started acting rude all of a sudden.

He was talking to a man in a very relaxed position with his arms at his head and crossing his legs. So we have cared about our luggage ourself. The hotel has a swimming pool and it looked clean. Staff is caring about the pool. The room itself was very spacious and has a size of about 55 sqm. But what a pity there was a mouldy smell in the room. There are 2 bathrooms with separated toilets, bath tubs and showers. The TV was a little bit small and not in an upright position. The room looked elegant and it was quiet. No noice was coming into the room. The hotel only has had a few number of…",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes

Wonderful meet and greet at reception, shown to room (upgraded) and then tour of the hotel's great facilities. Beautiful pool area (but get there early for a lounge), great restaraunt on upper terrace and wonderful breakfasts. The room we had (#19) was amazing - separate dressing room, 2 toilets, massive lounge room, huge bedroom with lovely bed and great ensuite. We loved it all - especially the little extras like the delivery of fresh fruit and free mini bar.

It had a real sense of elegance and impact when you arrived - us at about 1930 at night. I wanted this place to be great but it let itself down, overly complicated checkin process for people who clearly just want to get to their room after a day in 40+ degree heat, the rooms air conditioning had not been turned on so the room was really hot for the first night ( the air con was only in the lounge so took a while to cool the bedroom).

So we were looking forward staying in this hotel as we wanted best as possible on our last stage of honeymoon. And we've got it. At the end our expectations were very much exceeded. Yes it is a five star hotel with all amenities that you usually get. It has great location, overlooking and outside of the medina (just on the wall of it) so you can walk around feeling completely safe and without feeling being locked up in your hotel after sunset.

 July 2013,2,No substance ...,"This hotel is stylish and presents as a traditional Moroccan palace. It is located on the edge of the medina. After being ignored when we arrived, our greeting was rushed and cold, with our questions unanswered. We had booked the junior suite for 3 nights, but it was more like a standard/superior room, quite stuffy, cluttered and very small. Breakfast was simple. Dinner was pricey by Moroccan standards, but the food was tasty and the restaurant staff were friendly, even though their English was limited. On my last day I had a facial and found the therapist to be very rough and am sorry I didn't notify the spa manager. I was not impressed by this hotel.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2013,4,"Elegant, welcoming and well located","Palais Faraj is well located just outside the Medina and within easy walking distance of all the attractions of Fez. Fez has many beautiful Riad hotels within the walls, but this choice was made due to the large swimming pool, plus the delights of a rooftop bar and restaurant. Like many hotels in Morocco, the hotel offers a standard of interior design, service and space that would cost very much more in the UK. Room 22 was a large suite with full size sitting room, very large bed, dressing room and bathroom, decorated with traditional handmade moroccan tiles on floor and walls and a painted wooden ceiling. The room has a brilliant view over the medina, possibly the oldest walled mediaeval city in the arab world.

We booked the Favorite Suite but got upgraded to a Grand Vizier Suite, room #15. Room was gorgeous with a separate bedroom and powder room, and 2 huge balconies that included a great view of the medina! Only downside is the room is right below the restaurant terrace so we can hear chairs being moved around every now and then. Did reservation via email and Maryem, our contact, made everything easy for us. She was also there to greet us when we arrived, and to bid us farewell when we checked out.

The rooms are very comfortable, modern with everything you could possibly need in a hotel room. They are tastefully decorated, and so are the halls and pretty much everything in the hotel. The restaurants and bar have a breathtaking view on the Medina. Absolutely gorgeous hotel and impeccable service. Another perk of this Riad is that unlike most similar hotels, access is very easy, and cars go all the way to the hotel reception door and there are elevators so you don't have to struggle to get there or to get your luggage to your room.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Beautiful and Flawless,"What a stunning hotel. We stayed here 3 nights during an 8-day tour of Morocco and I could not have been happier with this choice. It is very well-located, but I found it nice to be just at the wall of the Medina instead of in the thick of it, so that coming back to the room was very relaxing and quiet. The grounds are really beautiful, with a tiled courtyard and numerous sitting rooms that have been restored to perfection. There is a pool off the main courtyard as well, which is a delightful way to end a day of hard touring. The rooms are exquisite.

So much so that we broke our rule and ate there both nights of our trip to Fes! The chicken tagine with pumpkin was AMAZING. Restaurant staff is friendly and went above and beyond for us. The wifi does not work consistently in the rooms. The breakfast was great and they made to order if you want omelettes etc. We had a huge king bed, very comfortable. And the hotel arranged a tour guide for us, Abdel, who stayed with us for over TEN HOURS showing us the city. You have to specify when you book that you want one of the few rooms with a view of the medina..

This place is gorgeous and authentic--and minus a view of the Taj, has them beat! (Has Vanity Fair done a photoshoot here yet?) We stayed in the 'Ambassador Suite'--and I am sure the ambassadors have been impressed, too. The hotel is replete with restored fountains, tilework and marble. It overlooks the medina and much of old Fes and the surrounding hills. If someone could have wave a magic wand over my itinerary so I could stay here three days longer--it would have been superb.

This also applied to the reception staff who were always available and courteous. After booking, we were proactivily contacted concerning their offering in terms of the spa and guided tours. Breakfast consisted of a variety of Moroccon breads, confitures, fruit, eggs, etc. We had dinner twice there and the food was quite good. Of course, the scene is fantastic (views of Fez).

 April 2013,2,definitely NOT for guests that primarily speak English,"Let me start off by saying that I was very excited for my stay here coming from NYC. I had contacted the manager before my visit telling him it was our honeymoon and he even upgraded us to a suite prior to our arrival and gave his personal cell phone for questions. Once we got there is where the problems started. The woman at the front desk just checked us in and never bothered to even show us around. once in the suite we see two random construction men on our terrace (the terrace has two doors one in our suite and one in the adjacent hallway) The employee with us wasn't appalled by this so I guess this is normal.

Even though the doorman was very sweet and showed him around, my son just didn't take to it, so the only other 5 star hotel in a similair price was Palais Faraj. We took a petite taxi there hoping he would settle down and approve.

We were in suite #21, which is gorgeous and huge (sitting room, walk-in closet/dressing area, massive bedroom, massive bathroom, good-sized terrace). The room was beautiful, decorated with traditional cedar/plaster/mosaics. We were welcomed with mint tea and cookies, both of which were delicious. We drove from hotel to the souk, but it was a very manageble quick drive (less than 10 minutes). I'm not sure how accessible it is by foot. If you are planning to stay here for several nights and want to have dinner somewhere other than the hotel, I'd suggest researching in advance and making reservations - unlike other cities, it's a bit more difficult in Fes to walk out of the hotel and find something to eat.

That was our experience at Palais Faraj. For me the lodgings define the ""feel"" I take away from a city. And that feeling was happiness and pinch-me-am-I-really-here gratitude for the experience.

Our room was a great place to hole up in when we wanted a break from the Fez medina. Oh, and the breakfast is delicious (the Spanish omeletes!) However, I wonder if Fez would be better done staying in a riad with its very personalized service. In Marrakech, we stayed in a Riad where the manager personally gave us directions to every single place in the morning we would want to visit, showed us on a map, and made sure we knew how to get everywhere.

 September 2012,5,Wonderful,"I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world. The Palais Faraj stands out from the crowd. From the minute you enter the beautiful entrance to the amazing service. It truly is a wonderful experience. The decor is luxurious, the attention to detail is outstanding. But most of all, the welcome for every guest is a delight to see. I will definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again on a visit back to Fes.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,Intimate 5 star wonderful,"My husband and I stayed at this small hotel for 3 nights as part of a tour. What a delightful experience. The rooms are very big with bedroom, sitting room, bathroom with separate toilet, bath and separate shower, big dressing room and a powder room, brand new huge white towels. Air-conditioned, wonderfully comfy bed, pillow made in heaven (am going to see if I can buy two), and strong wifi. The dining room has three sections, all delightful, especially the rooftop terrace which is open to the sky and overlooks the whole medina (dinner out here simply divine with a gentle breeze blowing). The restaurant food is very good, and the staff could not be friendlier, better mannered or more efficient. The owner and his wife were in residence and was absolutely charming.

 September 2012,5,An unforgettable place!,"We spent 3 days at The Palais Faraj, with a young baby and it was the best experience we had in Morocco. The smile of the entire team, the view from the restaurant, the confort of the room and the large swimming pool are fantastic assets. We will definetly go back as soon as possible. Thank you so much for those excellent memories.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2012,1,Required 500 euro deposit won't be refunded for up to two weeks,"Hotel asked for a 500 euro deposit on a credit card for a 2 night stay that cost 280euros. Fair enough. Asked when would the money be refunded - ""immediately after signing out"" was the prompt reply. Last four days in Marrakesh, which we were hopeful would be spent shopping in the medina, found out that the money won't actually be available for a minimum of a week (which would have gone far here). Now we have 500 euros less for shopping, in our final days here. Really put a downer to the end of an otherwise great holiday in Morocco. Let me make it clear we will get our money back, just when we return home, fantastic. Thank Palais Faraj!

 September 2012,5,Perfect combination,"It’s rare for a hotel to capture the spiritual essence of the city, while providing its guests complete modern day luxury. Palais Faraj rooms make you feel like you’re staying in a museum. The restaurant roof top breathe taking views of the Madina take you centuries back in time. Wonderful, relaxing accommodations are provided at the beautiful pool and spa. Best of all are the people at this hotel – who make you feel welcome and very well taken care of. Make sure to visit the rooftop restaurant, even if just for a cup of tea, it may end up in some wonderful conversations.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2012,5,A Great Asset to the Overall Fes Experience,"My wife were staying in Fes for just 2 days before continuing on to Marrakech, but despite the brief visit we had an outstanding and memorable time that was only enhanced by this wonderful hotel. Located on the edge of the Medina, it was in an ideal location by being reachable by car and also by allowing us to walk directly into the old city. Our room was gorgeous and spacious with a large, comfortable king bed and a view of the central riad and pool below. The hotel is clean, quiet, authentic, and staffed by a friendly, smiling staff. Also, the breakfast started our day off with strong coffee, delicious pastries, and fresh juices to prepare us for our trek through the hidden corners of the medina.

 August 2012,5,Superb hotel,"Stayed for three nights in August, as part of our 9 day trip to Morocco. The rooms are clean, large and shockingly beautiful. Elaborately tiled floors, immense collection of art and carpets throughout the rooms and common areas. The staff could not have tried harder to make our stay as pleasant as possible. (although communication in English was occasionally a challenge). The owner himself twice volunteered and drove us to the Fes medina. He was omnipresent at the hotel, assuring that things went smoothly and he was a great resource for info about Fes. Meals were available whenever and wherever we chose to eat, be it the pool, terrace restaurant or fancy dining room. New, clean spa was excellent also. The location of the hotel was excellent. Close enough to the medina to walk,…",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,Outstanding Hotel in Every Way,"During our recent trip to Morocco in June, 2012, we stayed at four hotels and Palais Faraj was, by far, the best. It is an incredibly beautiful hotel. It is only six months old and the owner went all out to ensure that this is one of the best hotels in Morocco. The service is the best and the staff is very helpful in every way. We enjoyed a delicious dinner and breakfast on the rooftop terrace. This hotel is worth a trip to Morocco just to stay there. If we go back to Morocco, we will definitely stay at Palais Faraj again.",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,4,new idea in Fez,We selected this palace through good looking pictures For my wife it was looking too new - it is an old palace partielly restored so it will take time for perfection but it is good taste and not cheap The owner is an ex tour guide - very professional but dont ask for a guide from him he will send you to his peers and that is not as cheap as it looks (they take 40% on all shopping you will make).. As it a new venture it is ambitious for the best service (not so easy to find) I must say cook is excellent and roof top view probably one of the best you can have Go,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 June 2012,5,Home away from home,"We stayed at this wonderful new hotel during the opening weekend of the annual Fes Festival of Sacred Music. We had had the privilege to meet the owner, Mr. Faceh, and have a look at the hotel before the opening so we knew we were in for a treat. It more than fulfilled our expectations. The hotel, adjacent to the western wall of the Medina, has all the amenities of a five star hotel. The reason for calling this the best hotel in Fes in 2012 is the excuisite taste in design and furniture, not to mention decorative and valuable art found everywhere in the hotel. Much of the interior decorations have been exclusively made for the hotel. The owner is of course ever present and attentive to all details, and the quality of service is very high without being pretentious.

 April 2012,5,A special treat in Fez,"My wife and I stayed at Palais Faraj for five nights during a three-week long tour of Morocco. It is a brand new, 25 unit luxury hotel just outside the southern walls of the Fez medina. Extraordinarily beautiful in design, it has suites that are so spacious and beautiful that you think you are staying in a Moroccan palace. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and modern. (Of course, like every bathroom in Morocco, you cannot shower without flooding the entire bathroom floor. I suspect that hotel architects in this country all got their start doing farm irrigation.) Not cheap. Good location, within a ten minute walk of the middle of the medina. There is a restaurant and bar with a view over the medina and a large and mostly underutilized swimming pool. …",Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Palais_Faraj_Suites_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 April 2012,5,The only place to stay in Fes,"For our first trip ever to Morocco, My partner and I booked a room at this place. (Full disclosure: A friend of a friend owns this place.) We got an Ambassador Suite. We arrived late and even without daylight, we could tell this place was amazing. It's more than a riad, it's full-service, boutique hotel. It's truly special, glamorous; and we found out has only been open a few month. Mr Faceh, the owner, and his staff were amazing and did everything possible to make our time here memorable from helping us secure a local guide, advising on wine (amazing selection) and arranging for the one hour drive to see the ruins at Volubilis (which is worth the price, you must see.)

The property and interiors are simply stunning, but the real difference here is that they make you feel like royalty.
