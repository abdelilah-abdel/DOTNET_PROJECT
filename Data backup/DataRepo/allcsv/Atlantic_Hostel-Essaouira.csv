 November 2019,5,The rooftop terrace you want to be on,"When we were in Marrakech everyone was talking about the guys at Atlantic Hostel. It sounded like the same old same old type of back packer ramblings but after six months on the road ‘The Best This’ and ‘The Best That’ really looses all meaning. Fast forward a week later, we’re walking through the market street of Essaouria looking for our turn into the medina. Between the fruit displays, food carts and mixed shops we see the obeachy and well aged sign for Atlantic Hostel. From there its only a 50 meters to the door but my man Simoking AKA Smoking has already spotted your backpack and is with the rest of the boys cheering you in. More like a Japanese Izakaya than a reception, everyone is shouting your name, introducing themselves, and horsing around. Between jokes and paper…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

The vibe is so welcoming and relaxed, the roof terrace is so beautiful and the ultimate chill out zone away from the hustle and bustle. But the best is the staff, they will become like your family and you won't want to leave, you will also meet other amazing travellers and you will eat the best food in the whole of Morocco made by CousCous. If you are a light sleeper it can be a bit noisy and the rooms are dorms, proper traveller style, I am quite a light sleeper but did not find it was much of a problem. Plus there is traditional live music every evening and a lot of dancing! Do not miss this place! We miss you Atlantic!…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

 July 2019,5,Mustapha approves,"Crazy staff, nice atmosphere. The best headquarters for venturing into Essaouira’s chaotic streets. In the morning you can enjoy a nice varied breakfast. You will need to keep an eye out for Fatha though, a dangerous nomad who throws bees at unsuspecting guests. The rooftop terrace is a destination for sightseeing all on its own, you could spend a couple of days there and still enjoy yourself properly.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2019,5,Chris 8,"We stayed there for 8 days then travelled around and then came back again for another 4 days. So we really liked it. The whole atmosphere is pretty relaxed and the staff was very easy going and polite to us. We did not try the dinner in the hostel even though many guests recommended it. Everything was clean and allright, the rooftop has probably the best view of any hostel in Essaouira. We also really liked the jam sessions on the ground-floor that happend frequently. We had a great time there and would definitely go there again.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2019,1,No sleep,"Very nice hostel but overpriced, we slept at a private room : it was just some wooden planks smashed together. It was under the terrace so we did not sleep at all because when someone walked on the terrace it made a lot of noise. The window was also broken; it didn't close. They should not ask €20 for something like that.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2019,4,Nice live music events!!,"When I was in Essaouira, I slept in Moga Hostel. But in the evenings, we used to go to Atlantic Hostel to enjoy the live music sessions over there. :) we were there in 3 evenings and everytime there was a group of young guys playing guitar, drumming and singing traditional berber music.

 June 2019,5,It's a magical place,"It was my first time in Morocco and coming to Essaouira was the best I could do. I stayed in this town for a bit over a week, and would still be there if I didn't had to go back home. I checked in the Atlantic Hostel right after the Festival, I got a nice room, I could even choose my bed, the receptionist Jamal showed me the Rooftop and told me a few things I could do in town. From the start they made me feel like home. Hospitality is a very important part there. The hostel fits in perfectly with the whole Essaouira vibe - really laid back and chill atmosphere, plenty of space to get to meet travellers and locals.

I'm only gutted I could only stay 1 night. Couscous, the manager, was amazing - friendly, helpful, and a good time!

 December 2018,4,"We ate here, didn't stay - great food & friendly staff",We booked through a surf camp and stayed at a local riad and ate at the hostel.

 October 2018,4,Great hostel,"Enjoyed our stay here very much. The room was well decorated but the window/door was very difficult to open/close and noisy too meaning I couldn’t close it early morning and a cricket kept me awake for ages. The bathroom arrangement is very communal and would benefit from a bathroom door. Plus one of the showers doesn’t drain. Hot though, and clean. The roof terrace is amazing, properly stunning and a great place to chill. You can see the whole city. Best roof terrace in Africa. Probably. We went for the communal food, but sadly the famous CousCous was having a day or two off! That’s ok, but maybe provide a decent alternative. Great breakfast, great live music and a chilled vibe. We will return.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2018,5,Would Recommend to a Friend,The atmosphere in this place is what makes the place definitely worth visiting.

The detailed map they provided me was more than enough to easily get directions. Beautiful terrace where breakfast is served, and on which you can see the whole city, nice view and stunning atmosphere. The nightlife will never be forgotten, after dinner, they get gathered and play different kinds of Moroccan berber musics and they light candles and make the mood so stunning. It was my first…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2018,5,My best experience in whole Morocco!!,"This hostel just felt like home.

Couscous, the cook of the hostels, cooks the best and super traditional Moroccan dishes every evening, the price is super cheap in comparison to restaurants, and it's super delicious. Also every night, you can chill on the rooftop: a very spatious place with lots of couches and blankets for when it gets chilly. I could also experience some traditional Moroccan music there - the people of the hostel have instruments placed everywhere in the hostel and LOVE playing it; drums, guitar, Berber instruments..

 May 2018,5,Nice people & beautiful terrace ❤️,Thanks guys! I really enjoyed my stay! ;-) The terrace is very beautiful and the people in the hostel are very HELPFUL and KIND. I will come back soon! I can also recommend you to go on a surfing lesson with Simba! H,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2018,5,Great spot and laid back,"Atlantic hostel was a great spot during our trip Essouira. The staff was very friendly,helpful, and fun. They made us feel welcome and we enjoyed all the people traveling through the hostel during our 3 day stay. The rooms are spartan and inexpensive but that’s exactly what we were looking for. I would absolutely recommend the Atlantic and look forward to staying here again in the future.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2018,5,"Good vibes, friendly people, great service, best omelettes","My friends and I stayed at Atlantic Hostel 3 nights and couldn't be more happy with the place. The staff were warm and friendly, the beds were comfortable, and the food was amazing and readily available. The live music and foosball was a cherry on top. Two tips: I highly recommend taking a surfing lesson with Simba, and don't laugh at Ayoub's jokes - it only encourages him ;)",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2018,5,Great Hostel,"I was here already a few times and I always enjoyed my stay. After reading the other reviews I have to say that of course: its not a fancy hotel or riad. So of course there isn't that much fancy stuff as there. I think that for this price it can't be better. The staff is amazing and I will for sure come back to this place over and over again. When i stayed there, there wasn't any bedbugs, but also this can happen. Still my favorite place to go to in Essaouira :)",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2018,4,Just made my trip to Essaouire,"This hostel is affiliated with the majorelle hostel in Marrakech. Again the staff gave the hostel its warm and friendly atmosphere. I booked for one night and ended up staying 4. Best to book a smaller dorm, 6 bed, as these are more private and comfortable. The terrace is the place to be when not venturing around Essaouire. A really comfortable and a bit bazaar space to stay, right in the medina and close to the markets, beach and harbour.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2018,5,Best Hostel in Town,"Simply the best, great staff. Beautiful rooftop where you can relax, chill out, meet people with panoramic view. The food was excellent. Nice rooms. Was my thirt time I stayed there.It always feels like coming back home..",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2018,5,Best roof in town,"This is a gem in the souk with a lovely terrace on top with some great views of the town. Tagine omelette was very nice as well as the fresh juices. We bought some fresh shrimps in the docks and Ayoub, the guy running the roof, was very helpful with our own preparation. Also he's very bad at table football. Also, also, beware of the fierce predator cat Couscous. 10/10 Would recommend Will be back",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2018,5,Go there!!!,"Stayed at atlantic the second time. Its just lovely people around, greatest staff and the best rooftop that exists! The view over the city is excellent, beds are comfortable and the breakfast is nice. When you're bored just go and cuddle couscous, the cat! The staff never fails to help you if you need any information or help. Going back anytime!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2018,5,"Friendly staff, nice rooftops, good people","Hostel was nice, not Riad, they offer local food for low prices. Staff are very nice and helpful.

 February 2018,5,A wonderful stay,"I've enjoyed my stay in the hostel. The food was good, the service was excellent and the communication was just on point, but it wouldn't have been as enjoyable if it wasn't for a certain member of the staff. His name's Mustapha Ait Cheihbi. He's really funny, nice, spontaneous and hard working. The guy's just so friendly and lovely and he will offer his assistance with any kind of problem you have. I know for sure I'm coming back to Essaouira again and I'll definitely give Mustapha a call.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 March 2018,4,Unique staff,"A wonderful Hotel easy to find it is in a lovely location, friendly staff good value comfortable rooms, the service is perfect. And will be happy to come again to such nice and unique place Thanks Mustapha Ait cheihbi",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

Run by a bunch of the most friendly guys from the desert, you will always feel welcome and at home. Chilling out at the rooftop with a beautiful view over the city, meeting interesting people from Morocco and from all over the world, and enjoying nice dinners under the stars with delicious Tajines, Couscous and fruit, you will have a good time.

 December 2017,5,Good for the youths & elders,"A beautiful and magical place. Youll love the staff spirit and also the place. Located in a very narrow street of essaouira in the old medina, you can meet some good vibes of the travellers on the roof top (that i recommend) or the hall in the ground floor. I go there whenever I visit essaouira meaning each 3 months",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2017,5,Best roof terrace!,"the roof terrace is brilliant the social place where backpackers from all over the world go (hostelword no. 1) on bbq night at the roof terrace you will meet the other travelers really nice but not that serious staff, they are like your friends very very basic standard – consider the price when it rained one night the higher level was under water",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2017,5,Nice Place to relax,"My boyfriend and me booked a double room. First for one Night but in total we stayed six Nights. Ouer room was simple, But clean. The bed was comfy. It was a Little noisy But the stuff told us befor we booked the room. The stuff was really friendly and helpful. More than usual. After two days we felt like home. Thanks for the exceptional hospitality. Every evening there is a nice Dinner for everyone who wants to join. For a fair Price. I really miss the atlantic and the awsome crew. We will come back soon.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2017,5,Good hostel,"Chilled hostel with a really cool roof area to sit and look out over the town, would recommend. But hard to find but the easiest way is to go down the Main Street and look out for the sign above the shops",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2016,5,Great hostel with a SUPER chill roofdeck!,"Great hostel for Morocco - the roofdecks are killer (it's attached/affiliated with Hostel Cloud Nine next door) and the atmosphere is chill. Nice coffee bar on the roof, and the staff was helpful! My room was weird (booked a private room...tiny and the walls were...wallpapered? with what looked like rice bags?) but clean and comfortable...I'm not mad at it :) Quirky fun place!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Great place to chill,I absolutely loved the Atlantic hostel. Especially the staff was great. The rooms aswell as the bathrooms were always very well looked after and clean. The roofterrace was the best part tho. A beautiful view and a constantly good atmosphere.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2017,5,Cous Cous and Atlantic Hostel made our experience great!,"Atlantic Hostel has an amazing ambiance, perfectly located and a great price. Right from the moment that you get there you feel right at home and Cous Cous, the backbone of the hotel greeted us and made us feel very welcomed. We were only there for one night but we had a big family, hostel dinner that night which was delicious followed but drinks with a group of about 20 of us - Cous Cous organized) which made out stay that much better. I would highly recommend this hostel for a day or a few weeks!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2017,5,Great Chef,"The chef Cous-Cous made the whole experience worthwhile, cooking fabulous meals the whole time we were there. He put in a lot of effort when it came to making sure we were enjoying our stay, knew what there was to see in Essaouira and helping to organise days trips along with transport. Again great food and a wide variety of food styles in his repertoire. Thanks for a great stay.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Fantastic atmosphere,"We spent two night in Atlantic Hostel and we loved everything the staff is amazing Rachid Galilio Slimane and all the others, they took us for hanging out in Essaouira it was amazing, we had couscous in the hostel and the best part is the Terrasse where you can meet everyone in a very nice ambiance !!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

 September 2017,5,Comfi place,"The Atlantic Hostel is an amazing place!! The place ist clean, the rooms are nice and the rooftop is just epic! The staff is also really nice and chilled but the best of all is the cook Couscouse! He is cooking every night and is a real professional cook. I ate one of my best Tajine here in the hostel. But He is more than a cook. No matter what kind of problem you got Couscouse will take care of it!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2017,5,Awesome !!!,"Super relaxing, I enjoyed my time at Atlantic hostel ! Hospitality, family and sharing are the words to describe this hostel ! See you next time ! You have the chance to have the best panoramic view of essaouira on the roof top !",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,My best stay in Morroco,"The beds are clean, the bathrooms are clean the hostel is huge with lots of places to chill and hang out to find the vibe you want. However that is not why you should come to this place. It is the main host 'Cousecous' that makes you feel at home. He will cook for the entire hostel every other night, which will be the best meal you'll have in Morroco. He doesn't ask commisions for booking trips and will walk with you to the grand taxis to get the locals price. Don't forget to stop on your way to spend a few nights here, it will be worth it.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,Best hospitality I have ever received,"North Africa is my 4th continent in a long round the world trip, and the manager of this hostel gave me the best hospitality I have ever received. Of course not everyone can expect this, but I definitely recommend the hostel. It's a great place to get away from the bustle of Morocco and enjoy the relaxed seaside atmosphere. Thanks for the memories! May we meet again!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2017,4,Best terrace in Morocco,"This was a super chill and big hostel, tons of people from all over the world. The terrace is huge and has a great view, plus the breeze is really refreshing at night. CousCous the chef/owner is such a nice man, definitely take time to talk with him when you stay here! Breakfast costs extra.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,"they are the best,very nice,family-like atmosphere!!! loved it","best surf hostel,the atmosphere is awesome,very friendly and chilled out ,the food was phenomenal, the times were unforgettable Best thing that's happened this year?atlantic Hostel. It was a great experience. I loved it.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 March 2017,5,great place!,"me and my friend lived in the hostel for 2 months as volunteers. was a great exerience. the actual building it old , but I liked it. some renovations ware made during our stay there, so the conditions are much better now. the view from the roof terasse it s just fantastic! maybe the greatest spot to see the city and the surroundings. and so many nice people coming there from evrywhere the globe.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2017,5,Perfect backpack hostel,"We stayed here for 3 days and we had the best time while staying in Morocco. The staff is really welcoming and full of energy. They offer cheap family dinners, made by the sweetest Couscous. We wanted to surf here and they offered surflessons, given by a crazy funny guy named Simba. Good vibes. If you're looking for a fun hostel where you can meet new people, go here!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2017,5,Fun chill place to stay,"Felt really welcomed when we first arrived, a lot of people in the living area chatting. Dorm rooms were spacious, enough showers. The terrace is really big and comfortable. The breakfast and dinner are really nice. Something different for dinner each night and the staff sang songs afterwards. Staff are very friendly and always chatting to everybody. Really recommend this hostel",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2017,1,WORST HOSTEL EXPERIENCE,"Apart from the woodstock banner and some seemingfully hippy style fourniture (a minimum) there is absolutely nothing to like or even consider within this hostel. Honestly, the rooms are so tiny and unclean. To top it all, the manager(?) Oussama is an unkind person, only looking for trouble, not 1 microgram of customer care mindset, its a pitty they keep destroying the hostel's cheerful soul by keeping this guy managing it, he fought with 3 people the same morning we arrived, and it's always the customer calming him down. ONE ADVICE TO PEOPLE WILLING TO COME TO ESSAOUIRA : DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSTEL IF YOU WANT A STRESS FREE VACATION (of course Oussama will reply just as he did with all people expressing their POV, and of course he will insult instead of apologizing as all hostel…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 June 2017,5,wonderful stay,"one of the most amazing hostel with a social stuff and all the advice you need to make your stay a memorable one, the dinner was good , will definitely come back here in the future, and hopefully stay for even longer! Much love :)",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,"Went for 1 day, stayed a week!","Couldn't bring myself to leave, great breakfast, amazing dinner, close to the beach, and nice staff. Recommend this hostel if you are backpacking and want to meet other travelers. Make sure you eat there and stay for the drums after!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,amazing atmosphere and staff!!,"amazing place, great terrace, the staff is the best, really relaxed, very welcoming, they do amazing dinners, and then they play yambé, This is the real experience. Muslim country, but here you can meet free bereber people",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2017,5,"Affordable, clean, fantastic staff","My friend and I arrived an hour or so before our scheduled check in and the staff were nothing but kind and helpful, letting us check in to drop our bags so we could get out and explore. The hostel was very clean with lots of fresh air and natural sunlight (if you're easily woken up by the sun I would recommend an eye mask). The terrace is beautiful and huge! Large spaces both in the sun and in the shade - a bonus were the hammocks. We didn't stay for dinner but ate their breakfast (20DH, 2 euro) which was large, filling, and a good balance for a great price that you wouldn't get elsewhere. We planned to take a night bus to Fez and they helped us book tickets that saved us money and hassle, such a relief from most places that will overcharge because they know they can. Great…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2017,4,Vibey!!,"If you can look past the cleanliness, this hostel is great fun! the staff are friendly and SO welcoming. They organise a whole range of activities for you to choose from while you're there from group dinners to kayaking. The rooftop is just spectacular and you'll meet so many people from all walks of life. The cleanliness of the private rooms wasn't the best, but the vibe of the whole hostel make up for it! we felt like family after just 2 days!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2017,1,Very nice city but this hostel is dirty,My first time in this city was really great time. But never again in this hostel everything going wrong Beds not clean . toilet not clean. Owner not kind really no need to be there I don't understand why people give an excellent for this dirty place. Not recommended There are many clean hostels in the area with same price.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2017,5,Easy to come hard to leave,"I started my Morocco from Marrakech. Came to this beautiful town and just wished not to move because here's all I need to be happy and relaxed. Atlantic Hostel I find perfect. Everything is 10 min away. Just 20 m is a local market where you can buy real fruit (not artificial that we got in Europe), fish and meat as well The place has great location. Interior is Moroccan... Looks so cool. It's like tower with stairs in the middle, that leads you to a terrace. Every floor has new toilets and showers, beds are comfortable and it's clean so well. I liked the people who where there... Sebastian, Max, Hugo,Andreas, Nabil, Galileo and Muhammad are like brothers to me now. Definitely would come again. And terrace, you should check it. It's wonderful...",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

 February 2017,5,Oasis of peace,I would definetely recommend this hostel if you're visiting Essouira. The rooftop is an oasis of peace while located near the busy market streets in the city centre. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. And you'll meet lots of other people at the rooftop. Bit hard to find but that's of course the charm of the city.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2017,2,"Party, smoking and drinking","This hostel was dirty and there were a lot of smoking, drinking and party. So if you're not into party all night long, don't book a night here! My friend and I had a room on the top floor, but because of heavy rainfall everything was wet outside of our room, which wasn't nice. The staff was friendly though and it's a really social hostel.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,cheap n cheerful,"Awesome Hostel They have been wonderful to me and made this place feel like home for me. The Hostel is far off the touristy backpacker places in essaouira, and it's located in the bottom of the bleu old city... What made me really enjoy my time here was the people I met. It didnt even took a while when everyone felt comfortable we had so much fun. I experienced GREAT hospitality, tidy, neat and affordable... Atlantic is a wonderful backpacker hostel, where you can meet wonderful people and ,even though it's quiet inside the big city, have a wonderful time! It's clean, quiet, So with that being said 1. Price - very reasonable price rates 2. Clean- the beds were clean, and the room was, 3. Quiet- yes very Quiet 4. Very spotty- and kept dropping. 5. Location. - great…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,Great atmosphere!!!,"I loved it here! First of all, Essaouira is a beautiful city. The hostel is big and has a big rooftop as well. There you can enjoy a nice breakfast and meet up with people during the day or in the evening. The people who work there (also volunteers) are very open and want everyone to have a good time. They eat together and if you happen to walk by, you must join, it's very nice. At night there is time for fun and music, but not so much that you couldn't sleep if you want to. The hostel is in de medina and you can also book surfinglessons there. I'm definitely going back here :)",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Best place ever,"the best hostel i've ever stayed. everything was good while my staying there the staff was really nice especially the Criziest guy Rachid and Yunus. they have a wonderful rooftop, nice breakfast, hot showers. thank you guys for everything that you did with me tell next time ;)",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,Just awsome,"I was booked for 2 nights, but because of the atmospher and the amazing Staff Especially Yunus, i end staying there for a week :) its really a good place, with a Spectacular Terrace. and thank you Yunus for leting my staying there Nice, hope to see you next time",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2017,5,Best rooftop terrace !,"Great hostel with a very relaxed vibe. Amazing rooftop terrace with a great view over Essaouira and the sea. It's perfectly located, close to the main market street and also close to the beach. Dorm rooms are small, but get cleaned daily. Breakfast is great! Served for 20 dirhams on the terrace with coffee, omlette, bread, yoghurt and a banana! Also the offer a nice dinner every day which you can join for a small contribution. Definitely recommend staying here!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Viva la COUSCOUS!,"What is there to say about the Atlantic Hostel in Essaouira? Plenty. But let's cover the basics first. The hostel is firmly in the category 'shabby chic'. The building is old, circa 1700's, but in generally good repair. Many of the old features have even been highlighted in a somewhat eclectic style (you'll see what I mean when you get there). Yet whilst some of the older plastering may be crumbling the hostel itself is kept remarkably clean. The cleaning women do a fantastic job and are always cheerful. The showers have a knack to the timing for hot water (usually best when there are less people using them) and the toilet facilities are good. The view from the terrace is fantastic and you are sure to spend many a memorable night enjoying the bands and music or relaxing…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Great place,"Lovely hostel with nice and chilled atmosphere. It's located in old Medina, so it's a perfect location. You have to try the dinner. It was the best food we had in Morocco. And the surfing classes are great!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2016,3,"Nice staff, dirty and old building","Went to the Atlantic hostel from a recommendation from a friend in Marrakech. When we got there, the staff was helpful and friendly. However, the building is under average to bad condition, especially with the pile of rubbish and left over mattresses in the corner on the terrace. We left after one night and rented a whole flat just outside the medina for the same price of a private room at Atlantic.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2016,4,"Amazing vibe, but rough around the edges.","This place is absolutely amazing and the source of most of my best memories of Morocco. The staff is outstanding and genuinely cares about you. The vibe is chill and dinner is excellent. Drum parties almost every night. But if you are picky about your comfort levels, you might have a tough time. You have to go next door for a warm shower, and cats everywhere meant I had a tough time with my allergies.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,"Fed by cous cous, hapliness ensued","It is the staff that makes this hostel so lovely. Sure it is Seth in a lovely 4/5 storie riad in the centre of essaouaria, with a prime rooftop overlooking the city, but the staff. Cous cous in particular, are awesome... Not only does he cook up an awesome feast for you, but he will even make sure you've got a spiced tea as he plays the drums for his guests and jokes around with everyone that they will never leave. Awesome place. Loved my time there.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,GREAT HOSTEL,"We had a couple of days in Essaouira and stayed in Atlantic hostel. Host (Yaseem I think) was just great. Like the rest of the team. I really liked Fatiha. Hostel has beautiful interior were you can hang out. Terrace is just great, with amazing view. Breakfast and dinner are exceptional. Like all the food in Morocco. Well I hope I'll come back soon.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2016,5,My all time favourite hostel!,"Wow. What a great experience I had staying here. Got recommended it from another traveller I met, abd it lived up to all the hype. Couscous, the chef, cooks the most amazing food every night for all the guests to have a big feast together. He also helped me organise my Sahara desert safari and accomodated everything else I needed. The hostel has such a good, casual, warm feeling to it. Easy to meet fellow travellers and each night the bongo drums came out and everyone got involved. Easily the best hostel I've been in and could not recommend it anymore to other backpackers!!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2016,4,"Friendly staff, good location, good breakfast","Essaouria and Atlantic were a breath of fresh air after Marrakech. The staff were extremely friendly, the hostel was relatively quiet at night and they served a breakfast beyond just bread and jam. Wi-fi isn't great and seemed to cut out a lot. They have a beautiful terrace where you can hang out. Overall, a pleasant stay.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2016,2,"""Wallet on legs""","The tittle is a quote from the manager of the hostel, so if you wanna stay in a place that don't see people, but cash and try to squeeze evry last dhiram out of you, your welcome to stay there. Often nice guest there though.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,Amazing people in an amazing place with an amazing atmosphere,"I've been spending a lot of time in this hostel. Because of its location, that is right in the middle of the medina, near to all the accomodation, the beach and the port. Because of its terrase where I spent almost half of my time in Essaouira, amazing place for sunset lovers. Because of Couscous THE chef and his amazing dinners from traditionnal moroccan food and also really affordable. Because of the amazing atmosphere, chilling, music playing, chilling and chilling. And because to its exceptional manager without who it would be just an hostel among the others. Thanks a lot !!!!!!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2016,4,Best atmosphere,"This hostel has the best atmosphere of any in Morocco. Tucked away off the main market street of the medina. 3 floors of room and a roof terrace with panoramic views of the town. Only 5 mins to the beach. The manager, Cous Cous, is a very friendly and helpful host as well as being an excellent chef and speaks great English. The other staff speak fair English and are helpful but tend to like to put off questions. Only a few cons at this place being that there are a few bedbugs and fleas about due to the cats and minimal cleaning compared to the amount of people here. Also hot water was hit n miss in the mornings. I would recommend as I had the best time here and would stay again.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2016,5,A great hostel in the Medina,"Great hostel, classic relaxed backpacker vibe, run by local Morrocans who are very friendly and helpful. Traditional Morrocan dinner is cooked for everyone several nights a week. A very good atmosphere.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,Amazing traveler vortex. Did not want to leave!!,"This hostel really makes Essaouira one of those special places that you want to get stuck in. Cool staff, great vibes and interesting people coming through. Hostel is clean and functional but it is really the atmosphere that keeps you here day after day after day. Highly Recommended!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,Never wanted to leave.,"Stayed a week at the Atlantic in September after initially booking only the two nights. The hostel seems to attract the right kind of people for a social and loving environment. The staff are absolutely great people and full of character. From the moment you step through the door you feel as though you are being let into the family and their home, not just your ordinary hostel. The rooftop terrace is a perfect way to compliment the atmosphere of the hostel, comfortable and relaxing yet social and atmospheric, mixed with great views of the medina. Couldn't recommend this place more. As an end note, I'm actually heading back in November I loved it so much.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2016,4,Spent a lot of time on the rooftop,"Staying here was definitely one of the highlights to my trip. We came in a group of 8 and it only cost us £107 each for the two nights and that's including tax. We had no problems with signing in. On arrival we were shown straight to the rooftop and given tea. The man called Cous Cous was an absolute legend, we love Cous Cous. The rooftop over looked a lot of Essaouira. It was a little windy, but it's was beautiful. Lots of blankets and sofas provided. A pretty edgy place, full of patterns, tiles, posters, and music. Always something going on and if their wasn't, then everyone whom worked their was very friendly and helpful when it came to suggesting places to eat, places to go and things to do. The beds were basic, but fine- just what we needed. Had lockers just outside…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,Highlight in Essaouira,"Although we had bad luck with our room, our stay was just awesome! The people who work there are amazing. It feels like one big family. We went with a group of 20 people from the hostel to a cheap lokal moroccan restaurant, guided by Couscous, the cook of the atlantic. He is a wonderful person and a bit crazy ;). The hostel has a roof terrace in the 4th floor which overlooks the whole city. Up there are plenty of couches to relax and hang out till late night. The hostel also serves tasty breakfast at the rooftop for just 20 Dirhams. If you're searching for a vibrant and welcoming place, then this is right for you.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,Lovely hostel full of great people,"Just stayed here for one night before going to Marrakech. We got to the hostel quite late in the evening, but arrived just in time for the big group dinners they arrange. For just 60 dirhams (equivalent to 4/5 pounds, had a 3 course dinner in a great environment, was able to meet loads of new people, and the food was absolutely amazing cooked in the CousCous kitchen with love and heart. All facilities were really nice, there was a good chill space downstairs, loads of cats wandering around if you're into that kind of thing. Big highlight for me was the roof terrace which has views over the whole town, really nice cushions and blankets and a little bar with music. Hostel is well located and pretty easy to find. Also the guys who run it are super nice and will help with any…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,Great stop,"I will come here on all my future Essaouira stops. It was dirty in the way most backpacker hostels are and as you can see from the photos, the roof terrace is excellent. It's windy but such a nice view and comfortable seating areas with an affordable bar and always lively. The bathrooms are a bit rubbish but they are enough. It's a massive place, constantly buzzing and great fun. The best hostel I've stayed at in Essaouira.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,Very good experience!,"Location is really good right at the biggest market street but far enough away to ensure a quiet stay. Beach is around 10 minutes away, depending on how far away from the town you want to go. Staff is very friendly and makes good breakfast! Rooms and beds are clean and the sheets are either changed or at least made for you every day, which is nice. Showers and everything are clean and have good pressure considering the relatively small town. Also the cats are a cute. A CUTE!!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,Awesome fun!,"Great hostel, I loved my stay here I still cannot believe the service and facilities you get for just 5€ it's amazing! Beds are comfortable, roof top is good fun and the atmosphere is very friendly. Great place for a solo traveller! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, not one compliant at all.. Definitely highly recommend staying here!!!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,Road trip Morocco,"Place is full of cool people sharing their travel experience with big smiles. We only stayed one night. The hostel is close to every convenience needed ( food, drinks and other stuff). Employees are available at all time to answer any question and advice you well about what's nice to see in the city. I'll come back anytime !",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2016,5,Missing Atlantic hostel already,"Brilliant stay, made loads of friends. Staff were amazing Thankyou Jeff, rashish, Ziad,azizs and kahlid. Great terrace. I want to go back every day was an adventure. Next time I go I'll defo go surfing",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2016,3,Ups and downs,"We stayed here for about 4 or 5 nights in a private room and overall it's a fine hostel. The rooftop (where two adorable kittens lived) was a great place to hang out, meet people and enjoy the view. Very inexpensive breakfast served here (20 dh). Staff is friendly and there is music upstairs at night. However the hostel is pretty dirty, and in general I don't consider myself super uptight about stuff like that. Our room was honestly a bit gross and I'm not even going to start on the ""wallpaper"". Location is great and I loved the city, but maybe there is a better place to stay. However, the value for money is alright.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,Amazing place!,"This hostel is an amazing place to stay during your trip to Essaouira. I guess this is also why people tend to stay longer than they originally planned, and so did we. The staff is very friendly and helpful, it has a great relaxed vibe mainly due to the amazing rooftop terrace where there is always someone to hang out with. The breakfast is good, the location perfect in the middle of the heart of Essaouira and the two small kittens they adopted are just too cute. I would recommend this place to everyone, couples (as I visited this place with my boyfriend), solo-travelers (as there is always company of fellow travelers), volunteers (I would definitely choose this place to volunteer) and all other people looking for a relaxing place to stay.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2016,3,Opinion,"For 4€/ night it was good. And even my friends didn't like to sleep in the boat, I enjoyed. I recommend this hostel, because the host are really nice and they give you the opportunity to work for accommodation and meal. So I think it's a good opportunity to visit and work",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2016,1,One of the worst run hostels I've ever stayed at.,"Rooms are clean. Cats are cute. Atmosphere is great. But honestly this is one of the worst hostels I've stayed at. The staff know absolutely nothing about Morocco or even Essaouria. Could never answer any of my questions or help me with anything. Vaguely told me to go ask someone else. The Moroccan staff treat the Western staff like s*#t. The men constantly made inappropriate comments towards the females & always touchy. Some of them made me feel extremely uncomfortable. There were always a bunch of random Moroccan men, including the Boss who would sit around and drink and smoke all day, lurking around upstairs who are incredibly sleezy and very touchy. Don't book the Sahara tour with them - the transfer to Marrakech doesn't exist. And when you're stuck in the middle of…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,12/10,"Amazing AMAzing AMAZING. Wow. I do not know where to begin with this hostel. Firstly the staff (Khaled and Rashid) were so so welcoming and helpful. They taught my friends and I how to make tagine one night. The roof terrace is a huge plus! This is what makes the hostel so sociable. The views are amazing, there are plenty of sofas to sunbathe on, both under a roof and outside, and a bar upstairs to buy as much alcohol as possible ;) It is the perfect hostel to stay in both with friends or solo. I was in a group with 3 other friends, and the majority of the friends we made there were traveling solo. We met 2 girls and a guy who got on so well they teamed up and travelled together for a week. Honestly one of the most social able, friendly, and beautiful hostels I have EVER stayed…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 June 2016,4,amazing hostel nice and cheap,"Cool hostel right in the medina. Comfortable beds, amazing rooftop bar to chill at and good vibes allowing you to ,meet interesting people. Staff were very relaxed and friendly. Only room for improvement is taps didnt work in one of bathrooms and laundry was same price as bef for a night. Overall definitely recommend staying here to enjoy the fantastic town of essaouira",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Great place to meet people,This was a great hostel! The roof top terrace is a great space and it was easy to meet people there. Also it has a bar which was a nice change in Morocco! The hostel is just off the Main Street so just moments walk from the shops and an easy walk to beach and port. The staff were really friendly and helpful and if it's a bit too noisey to sleep at Atlantic you can cross the road to sister hostel cloud nine for a quiet night. Great prices and I would definitely recommend to other solo travellers,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2016,2,A big let down,"We joined the hostel dinner 60MAD but the soup starter and the caramel cake (a supermarket jello) was really disappointing. During my visit it was raining so we couldn't use the roof top terrace. Inside it felt quite sketchy and we really didn't feel comfortable, so we changed hostels to the surf and chill hostel which was so much better!!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 March 2016,4,Nothing without Chef Couscous,"2 things separate this hostel from the rest in Essaouira - their rooftop, and their chef, Couscous. If you don't enjoy rooftops, and you don't eat food then find another hostel. Couscous is the heart and soul of this hostel, and without him, it would be JUST another hostel. Stay for at least one of his group dinners. Other bonuses of staying at this hostel is the beer served on the roof, and the location in the heart of the old town, 10 mins walk to the fish market and old Portuguese fort. They do however need to work on a few things - cleanliness is an issue here, I understand it is a busy hostel, but more time needs to be spent cleaning such a busy place. Showers are very limited in number for the amount of beds in the hostel, it would be quicker to go for a swim at the…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2016,2,Don't book a private room.,"My boyfriend and I opted for a private room which was a horrible choice. Our room was just a box built of 2x4s off the main walls and our ceiling was the base of the terrace so therefore very loud. It was cold at night and the window was missing glass. The sheets were thin and ripped. We had a sink and toilet on our floor but there was rarely toilet paper and the sink smelled horrible. Overall up keep was lacking. Pros- terrace was a great spot to meet people and hang out, tall beer 30dh Probably wouldn't have been as disappointed if we stayed in a dorm.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 March 2016,3,Nice Rooftop,"This hostel was fairly basic as most hostels in Morocco are. Had a really nice rooftop and was in a convenient location in the Medina and was quite easy to find. About a 10.-15 min walk to both the bus station and the beach. The breakfast was really good and good value. The hostel dinners cooked by the chef Couscous, were really good and is a good way to meet people. The rooms were pretty small and not really much space to leave your bags and there was a lack of bathrooms only (only two per floor) but again, that is pretty standard in morocco.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2015,5,Best hostel experience in Morocco,"So chill, amazing staff, great traditional dinners cooked every night where you can meet others. The chef is amazing and such a great guy. They organised surf for us, performed traditional drums music, and there's a terrace with great view. Lots of backpackers and travellers of various ages. Highly recommended.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 March 2016,5,Cool spot to meet new people,"Atlantic is the perfect spot for young travellers who would like to share story with new people. The rooftop scenery is amazing and the place is very nice and cheap. It's close to the beach, restaurants & the fish market. I would recommend anyone to go there without any doubt.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2016,4,Great atmosphere but a bit dirty.,"Great location just few steps from market. Staff is really friendly and positive. Diners served by Couscous in hostel are really good. Atmosphere is fantastic both during evenings with drums in saloon and during lazy breakfasts on terrace. Only con is fact that is a bit dirty so if you are ""sterile person"" you may be disgusted, but for me it was fine :)",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 March 2016,5,Awesome Stay,"Just a great, great hostel with an even better roof terrace to hang out! So friendly and lovely Staff, doing anything to make you enjoy your stay. Delicious homemade local food and always good live music afterwards. If you Plan to go to Essouira stay at this place - you won't regret it :))",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2016,1,disgusting BEDBUGS,first we want to inform everyone that in atlantic hostel you get BEDBUGS!! we met a lot of people who had after and during a stay in this place several bites. its very dirty and the staff doesnt change the sheets. its not clean. the staff also in our opinion is unprofessionell and bothers you with dodgy questions and weird looks. girls do not feel comfortable.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2016,4,Great stay,Had a great stay recently at Atlantic-extremely welcoming hostel where you can meet tons of people. The room and bathrooms were fine (it's a hostel and it's cheap) but the terrace is amazing and super relaxing. Staff are extremely welcoming and helpful to arrange anything we needed. We had a delicious dinner at the hostel with everyone followed by music. Couscous goes out of his way to make sure everyone feels included. You will definitely feel at home here.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2016,5,"Buy cancellation insurance for your flight home, because you won't wanna leave this place.","Where to begin? The communal dinners -- cooked by a guy whose name is Couscous (actually). The drumming and music in the downstairs lounge. The rooftop bar and terrace with an incredible view and a laidback vibe. The incredible array of people who stay here: from all over the world and, like me, wishing we could stay longer. When you stay at Atlantic Hostel, make sure your return flight home comes with cancellation insurance. You're going to need it.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2015,4,Great hippie hostel with such a good vibe!,"The vibe at the atlantic hostel is very chilled. People go surfing, play guitar, walk around town or make day trips and gather back at the hostel for evening drinks together. No problem meeting great people here and even when there are a lot of beds in the dorms, the prize makes it more than alright! Thanks for the great week Anas, Couscous, Canadian beauty, and others!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2015,5,Das beste Hostel in Essaouira!,Had a fantastic time at Atlantic Hostel. The rooftop terrace is a great place to hangout and meet fellow travellers and enjoy some live music. All staff are very welcoming and friendly and make sure you have everything you need. Highly recommend! Thanks for the hospitality Atlantic Hostel!,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2015,2,"Overcrowded, yet 2 permanently clogged showers, too noisy, not very neat","This hostel is very popular and I can recommend it to all those, who want to meet many people and don´t care too much about how they sleep and wash - basically all whose priority is socializing above anyting else. It´s not the cheaest one around, so I would definitely expect more. The worst experience was showering - just two showers for quite a big number of guests, both usually clogged or rather dirty. Still someone waiting outside, since there are just two toilets, too, in the same rooms as the showers. Usually out of toilet paper and almost no privacy. In the morning, suddenly there was no warm water, which can really piss you off, when you have just put shampoo all over your hair. Rooms are nicely decorated, but could be definitely much cleaner. Compared to other places,…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,Great dinners at Atlantic Hostel,"Yassine was a wonderfult host. On most of the evenings I was there, he cooked an excellent dinner for everyone. The fixed price was reasonable, and we all ate there without question when he cooked. In addition to the food, the conviviality and chance to get to know fellow hostelers was great. The only negative for me was that another employee promised that they could wash some laundry for me in three hours. It took 36, and then it was still wet, and they would not let me dry it in the sun and wind on the roof terrace. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend staying at Atlantic Hostel. The hostel was just off Ave. Mohammed Zerktouini, and was easy to find. Suggestion: Have your bus/tax/shuttle drop you off at the gate ""Bab Doukkala"".",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2015,5,This is the best hostel!,"This hostel is the absolute best, it's quirky, friendly, cheap and the manager 'Couscous' makes food every day for all those who want it. 3 courses for 60drh. Right in the middle of the medina, yet peaceful at night, an excellent roof terrace with an interesting food lift contraption. It is also aesthetically pleasing with some fantastic moroccan architecture. If you go to Essaioura, stay here, that's all I can say!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Amazing,"It was my second time in this hostel... and it becomes more and more my favourite. Everythink is harmonious in this place. Form the atmosphere, to the people, the vibe, the food the rooms. The best is the terrase.... with it´s perfect view above Essouira...and the great get toghethers at night with drum sounds, gitarre and traditional songs. The price is very low... and the rooms where always very clean. The bathrooms are pretty ok. But the biggest plus for me are the people there, the staff is so nice...and they take really good care of you. With the time you really feel like home there... sometimes I felt so well that I was not willed to go outside ;-). Just enjoy and feel the positive energy of this place.....a place where you never want to leaf anymore.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2015,3,The same like many hostels in Morocco (they recently had bedbugs),"To be honest I am not an experienced hostel traveller so I am going to be mild. My experience is with NZ hostels and they are usually quite new etc. Breakfast is not included it the booking. Costs are 20 dirham. Be aware of that before you order breakfast. For 35dh you could also go to one of establishments in the Medina. Like: - Nice rooftop terrace with a view (don't mind the pillows etc that stay out there during the night) - They organised a bbq on the rooftop - Near busstops, in the Medina, near alcoholshop ;) Dislike/inconveniences: - One of my friends was bitten by bedbugs. So the next day we were moved to another room that was cleaned the day before (also due to bugs). But at least they are adequate in dealing things quickly - Sheets are, like many hostels here, a…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,perfect athmosphere,"there are many good things to say about this hostel (central location in essaouria, cheap and delicious breakfast, clean rooms, ...) but most importantly: the athmosphere there is great! guests and staff meet at the rooftop every evening, play music, chill, relax,... the employees are really great people (especially yonas!), always helpful and kind - and they are excellent musicians! all in all: you have to come here in case you visit essouria!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,Great stay and super social,"If you're a single traveller looking for a social place to stay then this place rocks. The big common area downstairs and the amazing roof top terrace are a great place to chill and chat and they do a lot to get guests together (bbq, drinks etc). The location is perfect, right in the middle of the medina and a 10 minute walk to the port and beach. The facilities are fine, though be prepared for the super high top bunks without safety barriers that are common over Morocco. Would stay again and recommend!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,The best stay in Morocco,"I spent 2 great nights here in Atlantic hostel, is very good location in the center of old town, 5-10 minutes walk distance to the beach and the port, the stuff in the hostel are all very kindly and make their guests feel like home, the rooftop is the brilliant that I'd like strongly recommend, where you can stay a whole day there, listening music, reading books, having drinks, talking with friends and enjoy the magnificent view of the city and ocean, you can go to jogging near the beach with the sunrise view in the morning and the stunning sunset is waiting for you when come back in the afternoon. I really enjoyed my last night there, we had a big dinner together and the music party was fantastic, I had my first lesson of playing Africa drum and dance, which will be my best…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,BEST HOSTEL IN MOROCCO!!!,"I would say no trip to Morocco is complete without a stay in Atlantic Hostel in Essaouira. Amazing place with a genuine backpacker vibe, the nicest and funniest staff you will ever meet. The best bits of Atlantic Hostel: -Hostel terrace, probably the highest roof in Essaouira with WiFi and phone charger points -The genuine Moroccan meals prepared every night by 'Cuscus' the hostels crazy animated Chef for only 60dirham - Live music jam sessions put on every night by the hostel staff. -Central location right in the Medina and close to the bus station -Cheap! I was paying less than $9AUD at the time Would recommend this hostel to anyone visiting Essaouira!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,These people are crazy !!!,I wrote a few good reviews about some hostels but this one is realy a 5 star hostel !

Thank you for the funny time :),Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,Made My Holiday,"After hiking in the Atlas, I ended up last minute visiting Essaouria and this hostel made it one of the best spontaneous decisions I've made while travelling. I've stayed in lots of hostels, and this is one of the most welcoming, friendly and attentive I've visited. It's colourful, fun, with a fantastic roof terrace for hanging out in the evening and amazing to wake up to. I was travelling alone, but didn't feel bored/lonely. I just grabbed a bunk bed in the dorms on the first floor, which was a really good price, and just what I needed. There are lockers which are free to use. People seem to make themselves at home, laundry was everywhere but that's what backpackers need. The facilities were good, the WiFi had a suprisingly good signal in the rooms and on the roof and the water…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2015,3,"Great rooftop, great staff, not the cleanest.","We stayed here for 3 nights in early September. The hostel is only a 10 minute walk from the Supra Tours bus station. It is situated within the walls of the medina. We chose this hostel as it had the best reviews on hostelworld and because the rooftop looked really cool. The man who runs the hostel and all of the staff working there were extremely nice and welcoming. The interior of the building looked like it would have been stunning in its day, however it is currently looking very tired, dirty and in need of some TLC. As it is an old, traditional Moroccan home the bedrooms are very narrow and dimly lit. There were 3 bunk beds in our little room with bedding that I'm not sure is changed after each guest. My mattress was hard and caved in, however I may have just been unlucky…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2015,4,Great chilled out Hostel with friendly staff,"I planned on staying here for 2 nights - I stayed a week and then went back again at the end of my trip. Atlantic hostel has a great relaxed vibe - the rooftop terrace is a great place spend hours relaxing and meeting great people and they play some great music and organise beach football etc. The staff are incredibly friendly - particularly Yassine who cooks an excellent dinner everyday but also Mohammed, Karim and all the others who are always helpful! The hostel, like Essaouira, has a shabby charm about it. It could do with a bit of maintenance etc and if you're an incredibly fussy traveller I probably wouldn't recommend it. However they were painting/replacing mattresses when I was there last so it will be even better. Overall I'd definitely recommend Atlantic Hostel -…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,"Great terrace, really nice people","Excellent staff, always willing to go the extra mile to help in anyway possible. The roof terrace is one of the best meeting point/chill out area's I've been to, far too easy to loose track of time up there.

 August 2015,5,Our stay at atlantic,"Me and my friend arrived to stay for two days, but we ended up staying for as long as possible.

The young men running the hostel have good English and will readily give directions, advice or help to organise trips or activities and make suggestions you may not have thought of. Tea, coffee etc are available throughout the day with cooked breakfast and evening meal available for a very reasonable additional charge. If I have any grumble it's that guests are not encouraged to use the kitchen. They would rather do it for you. This is a fun and lively hostel without being rowdy. The overall atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. Spontaneous music sessions with guests encouraged to join in are great fun whether you participate or…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

Hostel reminded me of a starring role in midnight express! No hot water, dirty sheets, hash head staff... You name it, we got it!

 February 2015,1,honestly the worst place I have ever stayed at (and I have stayed at many hostels around the world),"This hostel is really the most disgusting and disorganized place I have ever been to! We hadn't reserved a room in advance but wanted to stay at the hostel because of the good reviews. On arrival the staff seemed pretty chaotic and there were like four different people who approached us and told us to sit down and wait while they check. So we waited for like 15 minutes and after I asked again they seemed to be weirdly confused and told us again to wait. Finally five minutes later someone showed us two rooms, both not cleaned up yet but as it was around midday I thought this shouldn't be a big problem as I was sure they were going to clean it up. Since we were already at the hostel and even though I was a bit uncertain we took a room on the top floor, told them we would come back…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2015,5,Crazy hostel!,"It is a perfect hostel. The owner is a super nice person, who has treated us like family. always offering tea and other things.

 March 2015,3,A Mixed experience,The people running this hostel were friendly but the quality of the rooms and hostel is definitely below the normal standards even taking in to account the cost. I had paid for a two bed private room for my son and I and they had booked a double bed so we were first shown to a horrible damp dark bunk bed room on the top floor but I suspect that even the guy taking us to the room could see how it looked as he said we could still take the double bed to which I immediately agreed as it had to be better. The room when we were shown to it was a little better but the only window fell off when I tried to open it and it seemed damp in the room. Also the bed was not at all comfortable and I didn't even dare look at it too closely. The shower near the room had a missing head so was…,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

My friend and I stayed two nights and it was very loud because people jam out all night till 4am. The staff don't remember anyone who stays in the hostel and don't really clean very well. The view from the rooftop is beautiful and the hostel has an amazing location, but that's the only nice thing I. Can say about the hostel.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,great hostel,"Excellent location, super vibe, very friendly hostel. Nothing is too much trouble. Enjoyed my stay Close to all activities and the most wonderful beach. You can cook for yourself for a small charge and take advantage of the wonderful fresh fish and vegetables every day",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2014,5,Makes you stay forever...,"Fantastic place you will really miss. Colorful place, relaxed atmosphere, lot of interesting people to meet. Astounding double-deck terrace, good prices, and above all the best-ever staff, you can learn a few thing from, and have a little party with. They make the atmosphere unique!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Woodstock is alive here,"We really like this hostel. We fill there like at home. Very calm place, but from time to time it is nice to be surprised with a improvised drums, and not only, jams session. The music is in their blood! It is in the perfect place in the calm street of the medina.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2014,4,Typical backpacker hostel,"If you are an experienced backpacker and your standards are accordingly–look no further–you found a nice little spot in Essaouira. Amazing people, good food and a nice terrace. Yes, the common area is a bit shabby and there are some weird folks hanging around, but all in all it is quite charming in its own way. We spent two nights in a private room and it was ok, but bring your own toilet paper and soap. The location is right in the bustling heart of the city and perfect for late night bargaining. We would check in again.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,"Great staff, beautifull terrasse and best place to relax in essaouira.",I stayed in 5 hostels in essouira so far and this is the best choice. I come to essaouira on a regular basis and last two times I stayed in atlantic. Next time I will again. If you need anything in town or you need help chalek will take care of it and make sure you you don't get riped off. Highly recommend.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,The best stay ever...,"We've spent 6 nights in a private room. It is on a great location, the room was comfortable, we always had hot water. You have the chance too use the kitchen, learn to cook a local dish and hang around in the relaxed atmosphere of the lounge or terrace. The staff was the warmest and friendliest ever. If you take a small step to know them they will be more than happy to give you information, and more than that, tell you about the culture, customs. We felt like we became members of their family. I would suggest everyone to step out of their shell, take an effort to know the hosts, every minute spent with them is worthy :)",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2014,5,Beautiful stay with beautiful people,"We've stayed 6 nights in Atlantic in the private room, shared bathroom. The hostel has it's strong character. If you open your mind and get know the boys who keep the hostel you get your chance to have an amazing stay in Essaouira. One thing that I learned in Morocco, local people behave with you exactly how you behave with them. We felt very lucky that the Atlantic team treated us as their family. They give us useful information on the place and prices. We cooked together, eat together, learned about Morocco much and thanks to them we have the sweatiest memories about this place. Thank you Chalek, Jalile, Omar, Abdel, Hassan, Mohamed, Ismail and the silent friend of Chalek :) Hope to see you again!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,great terrace,"FANTASTIC STAY! The private room was very clean and tidy and comprised a double bed and a shower with a good stream of hot water. The toilette was situated only a step away. The dorms were also very clean, the beds immaculately made with warm blankets provided. Great roof terraces! But the best thing was the people. We had a great night making a traditional tagine and the hosts were so friendly and helpful organising transport and activities. They also make a mean breakfast! Recommend!!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,happy to be again with nice poeple and good location,"I am so happy my friends and I stumbled upon this hostel over spring break! When my friends came to visit me in Morocco, I also took them to stay here! If you never left the hostel you would have the time of your life... eating Moroccan food, being serenaded with guitars and singing in the lounge, swinging and relaxing on the hammocks, and enjoying the company of new friends! Loved Essaouria and would stay here again.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2014,5,nice poeple,"Friendly and hospitable atmosphere, great place to meet with other travellers. Rooms & bathrooms spacious and clean plus a handy fridge to store food in was a bonus. Nice roof terrace with panoramic views over the town, downstairs eating area was comfortable and a good size for mingling with a groups of friends. Rasheed and Jon were, welcoming, warm and attentive members of staff who helped made the stay memorable.This was one of the most chill places I have ever been! I felt like I had been there months in a matter of minutes!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2014,5,nice place to get fun,"had an absolutely amazing time at Atlantic hostel. Not only was it in a perfect location, but the staff (osho & Galilio) were so lovely and very helpful. It was a very relaxed vibe and was a great place to just chill out. I've stayed at a lot of hostels and this is one of the few that I have actually felt at home. The other guests were awesome too! Definitely recommend the Tagine cooking class!!! Definitely the best tagine I had in Morocco, without a doubt! I will be so sad to leave Atlantic hostel!!!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

 October 2014,5,Great hostel in Essaouira,"I've spent two nights in this hostel with a friend of mine. It is very well located in a little street of the Old Medina, very close to the harbour, to the beach and to the main touristic attractions. The staff is very friendly and always ready to help.

 October 2014,4,"lovely staff, great roof terrace.",Great hostel in the middle of the medina ìn essaouria. Everything you need is within walking distance. Staff really friendly and will do anything for you. Stayed longer than planned and sad to leave. Roof terrace is really relaxing and really cosy. There was a cous cous party the first night I stayed lots of drumming on djembes and dancing around followed by tagines then to a local bar with all the staff from the hostel! Had a brilliant time would recommend to anyone to stay here. Thanks atlantic. X,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,the best staf ever,Lovely atmosphere and staff. Full of art work and music. Lovely roof terrace over looking the city.

 November 2013,5,Best hostel in Essaouira,"Very friendly and fun environment, the guys at the hostel are really cool and helpful. Great spot in the middle of Essaouira. I was meant to only stay for a day or two but the place was so good I ended up staying for over a week. Lovely rooftop that overlooks the whole town. Thanks Atlantic",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2014,5,Feels like coming home,"If you like being welcomed very friendly and personally, if you like nice drumming sessions at nights, if you love hanging out on a nice roof terrace with other travelers from many different countries who just spontaneously share their food with each other... Go to Atlantic Hostel! I have been there with my 14 year old daughter who also loved the place and the people very much.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2014,4,A very nice place to stay in Essaouira,"I' ve been with my friend in this hostel and we really enjoyed the time there. The location of the hostel is perfect: in the middle of the medina - next to the Supratours busstop - also not far of the beach and easy to find. The prices of the rooms are cheap and you have all you need. The hostel has as well a very nice and big roof terrace and public room where it's always easy to meet fantastic and open-minded people. Also a good place for relaxing and enjoying holidays. I think, that's the best of the hostel - the nice ambiance, also supported from the polite, hospitable and very nice staff, who always make an effort for doing the best for their guests. We really felt like at home and in fact there was no evening we didn't spend with nice people playing games, listening music…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,the best experience with cool and friendly staff,l ben in so many hostels in my experience travling all over morocco and definitely Atlantic hostel in essouira its the best nice location in the heart of el madena very clean and must important the very nice people how is raining this business . l enjoyed my stay in this hostel no kidding ?l was going to stay just for couple days but l loved the place and l stayed 8 days witch is cool . thank you guys for taken care of me . lorida from califorina republic.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2014,5,the best hostel in essaouira,"Great location, very nearby Supratours busstop, in the heart of the ancient and beautiful medina of Essaouira. But the best about this hostel is the ambiance and positive vibe. The staff is not only very very friendly and kind. But a lot of fun too, very generous and they do everything they can to make your stay unforgetable. Was supposed to stay only one night, but felt home right away and stayed for 4. When you come to Essaouria, stay in this hostel. The rooms aren't expensive and the atmosphere is priceless.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2014,5,Fantastic hostel in an amazing Moroccan city!,"Atlantic Hostel became my home for two months after originally reserving only 3 nights! The town is lovely and lively and so is the hostel and its friendly staff. I can't say enough good things about the place- great location, cimfy rooms, good food, gorgeous views from the terrace, clean and safe. The best part is the wonderful Moroccan hospitality! It is a great place to use as a base for further exploration or for relaxing by the sea.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2013,1,One of the worst hostel experiences of my life!,"Well. This is certainly one of the only occasions I've ever found for Trip Advisor to be so WRONG and totally misleading! The reviews for this place on many different sites are excellent. The reality was a ridiculous excuse for hostel accommodation. The hostel is in a pretty decent location. A 10 minute walk from the bus drop off point outside the city walls, and a close walk to most things you'd want to see in Essaouira. Knocked on the door. Door opens. Man who appears to be completely stoned stands there smiling blankly. Had absolutely no idea what we were talking about and what we were doing there. Trying to check in was like a sketch on a comedy show. If we weren't so tired, this could've been hilarious. We showed him print offs of the booking we'd made through…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2014,2,Not impressed...,"We stayed in two rooms during our time at Atlantic hostel. On our first night we encountered bed bugs. To give the staff their due they did change our mattress and sheets immediately and gave us a new room the next day when it became available. The first room was in the main building and stank of damp. The bathrooms in this building also consistently had hair in them, blocking the drains. The second room was much better! It was in the building across the road which was not only more modern but much cleaner. I am not however convinced that the sheets in either room were clean... Also there is never any toilet paper. Despite this disappointing experience the staff are lovely and it is a vibrant hang out space for travellers.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 June 2014,4,A perfect microcosm of Essaouira,"I stayed in June for 3 nights just before the Gnawa music Festival in the first floor 10 bed dorm. A beautiful Riad-style hostel with free hot water showers and clean toilets.Wifi was good. The location is about 10 minutes walk from the beach and Kasbah, conveniently tucked down a side alley off the main street of the Medina. The staff were friendly and offered to make dinner ( couscous and vegetables) for about 10 Dirham each. Fully functional kitchen. Large terrace area perfect for sun bathing or lounging. A beautiful Hostel, well located and great value for money.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2014,3,Would reconsider coming back,"Our stay began quite positively. As with other Moroccan hostels, we were checked in and given free mint tea before being shown our dorm. We booked into a 10 person mixed dorm which consisted of 5 bunk beds. We were given a little tour of the hostel, shown the showering facilities and taken to the rooftop terrace which gives an amazing panoramic view of Essaouira. The staff member who showed us around was very friendly. The people we shared with seemed to have been staying at the hostel a few days and raised no complaints. I was however hesitant of the quality and hygiene of the beds after reading a warning from a hostel we stayed at in Marrakech that the Atlantic Woodstock had bedbugs (we had already booked to stay at this hostel before reading this warning) Ahead of my…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,"Lots of fun! Great bunch of people! Wish I could have stayed longer. Helpful, friendly 😄","Helpful and friendly from the word go, lovely terrace to chill. Close to superb bars and restaurants. Live music in the communal areas courtesy of mustafa and his guys! Lovely atmosphere. Wished we could have stayed longer. Definitely good value for money!

 May 2014,5,"Lovely staff, lovely hostel","This was a great hostel and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for somewhere to relax in Essaouira. The staff were very friendly, helpful and great to chat to - they even served us our breakfast up on the lovely roof terrace! Really good location, slightly tricky to find but if you have the address someone will point you in the right direction.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 May 2014,5,Great hospitality!,We really enjoyed our time spent at the Atlantic hostel. Although only there for a few days we found the atmosphere really welcoming and the staff went out of there way to make us feel at home and kept us smiling. Rooms clean and comfortable with a great roof terrace overlooking the city where we enjoyed breakfast on our first morning (nice sheltered spot to relax in the sun away from the essaouira wind!). Great location in the centre of the Medina. All in all highly recommended.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,Everything you need!,"It is a very frindly and well-situated place to stay! With an relaxed and homly atmosphere, clean rooms, really nice people and a terrace with a great view :-)! So I think, all in all... what more could one want!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira

 March 2014,5,very nice poeple,"I loved this hostel, definitely one of the best I've ever stayed at. Very friendly and helpful staff. I stayed in an 8 person room and it was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. Also, it was a good atmosphere with nice hang out spots! Exceeded my expectations by far!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,Backpackers paradise!,"I was here for 1 night and 2 days. A really awesome place in Essaouira, near to the city center, 10-15 min to the Atlantic Ocean beach, 15 min to the bus stop. Really cool, friendly and helpful stuff! Great atmosphere with all the backpackers around the world. Bedrooms and bathrooms are clean and tidied up.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 March 2014,5,"Good location, friendly staff and great atmosphere would recommend","We arrived here after a long bus journey from Taghazout near Agadir. A local lad lead us to the front door where we received a very warm welcome from the staff. After finding our booking on the computer we were given a guided tour around the two buildings which make up the hostel and shown two different rooms for us to pick out of for our stay. After dumping our belongings in our chosen room we ventured out for the rest of the day. The staff were very helpful in showing us how to get everywhere we wanted to go. We ate breakfast on the roof in the mornings and a tagine on one of the evenings was one of the best meals of our trip, well worth the wait. All in all I would definitely recommend this place.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2014,5,"Friendly staff, clean rooms and great atmosphere",I was so happy to find Atlantic Hostel in Essaouria. The staff were immediately welcoming and I felt safe staying here as a female traveling on my own. The building is beautiful and has a great atmosphere for meeting new people. Relaxing on the roof terrace was one of the highlights of my time at Atlantic. The terrace offers panoramic views of Essaouria and a nice place to eat breakfast and get some sun before heading out for the day. I stayed in the ten bedroom dorm and found it very clean and comfortable and ended up extending my stay for four more nights. They have a locker you can use to store your belongings and other services such as laundry which I found very helpful. It's hard to leave this place! I greatly appreciated the staff's insight into Essaouria and traveling in…,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2014,5,- Overall: good! -,"I stayed many nights at Atlantic Hostel during my trip to Morocco. 1 word: perfect from ""A"" to ""Z"". The dormitories were clean/+confortable, the living room and terrace are really amazing places for the price you pay. In Essaouira, I dont think you can find a good accodomation like Atlantic hostel: I highly recommand this hostel! Big up for the staff(music, tips, etc)!!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2014,1,"Terrible, unorganized and dirty","If you pay 25€ for a private room with shared badroom, you can at least expect a bed. We got a dirty mattrass on the floor, disgusting unwashed sheets and no curtains. After we complained, they agreed to lower the price a little, but it was still way too much. Tip: Stay away! And if you decide to go either way, don't agree before you checked the room yourself, don't forget your sleeping bag and demand a room in the main building, like the website suggests.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2014,1,Worst stay in morocco,"Me and 3 friends were looking for a comfortable accomodation to spend our last night in morocco after two weeks travelling around. Because of the good reviews we decided to make a reservation in the atlantic hostel. Worst decision ever. We went to all the same.stuff as someone else described allready. At first we had to pay before seeing the rooms (we did because we had no doubts the rooms were gonna be okay). Then we were brought to the other building across the street were we saw the most horrible rooms ever. We booked two double private rooms with shared bathroom. To shorten the story: matrass on the ground, dirty sheets, dirty curtains, hair on the ground and in the pillows, no toiletpaper and disgusting toilet and shower. Then we had to ask for keys ourselves to close up…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2014,5,The biggest hostel in essaouira,"Great relaxed hostel with very friendly and chilled out staff. There are no worries in this place, the location is great, right in the Medina and the hostel itself has a very relaxed, safe and friendly vibe. The staff had no problem with us keeping our private room even though we didn't know how long we intended to stay. It's a very creative big place, which is brilliant if you enjoy painting/drawing/writing etc.every staff is singin! because they have guitar, jembe and gnaoua, we all guest enjoyed music together. it was really nice moment. and they serve to me very good meal and tea! i like the concept of this hostel. i was impressed by their free imagination. for sure i want to come back here because only one night is not enough!!! i was inspired very much. thank you Atlantic…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 January 2014,3,Good for the price,"To get there it is easy , from the bus stop strait to the Medina gate then pass one arc ,then 10 meter on your left there is a little street you see the sign. A warm welcome from the staff, in English , but don't ask any question they almost don't understand you. The dorm is ok 10 beds in a room with balcon. The staff provide breakfast for an extra 20 DM and the evening they cook as well , if you lucky, I waited 4 hours to get my Tagine then I went in bed empty stomach. The staff try to entertain the guests, bob Marley and old 80 music with a fourth some dancing, how funny it was. I visited the bath/ toilet room and this place need attention definitely , but it is ok after all, if you're not too fassy .",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2013,5,relaxed hostel,"Me and my friends stayed in Essaouira Old Town Hostel during the Gnawa festival in , 2013. Absolutely brilliant place to stay! Perfect location, very central. Hostel is really clean and has this relaxed, no stress, “I’m happy!” atmosphere. Really great staff!! I give the biggest credit and respect to the crew for balancing us and the other guests to enjoy all we all needed: music, singing, cooking, eating, and a very comfy sleeping. Thanks for magic atlantic Town Hostel, see you in Summer!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,good hostel good time,I stayed at the Atlantic Hostel for 6 nights. It was probably the best hostel i have ever stayed in. The people are as friendly as it can get and helped me with everything i needed. the breakfast is good and the rooms are very clean. but really the most important was the time we spend together drinking tea and chatting with the staff and the other guests. all in all I had a great stay,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,"Perfectly located, and nice view rooftop terrace","This is a great place in the heart of the medina yet quiet enough to sleep, great value for money, high standard of accommodation and top marks to the Staff who run it . Really helpful, friendly and want to make this hostel a place where people feel at home and plan to return. I know I am already thinking about that,and for sure!!. Plenty of room for surfers and their boards and a hammen next door to relax.Definitely i will stay next time in Atlantic hostel.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,Home away from Home,"Every trip to Morocco should include a visit to Essaouira to relax from the souks and salesmen of other cities - and every visit to Essaouira should include a stay at the Atlantic Hostel. If you're up for a party, you can find it here. If you'd prefer to relax, just ask to stay in one of their rooms in the adjacent building. Either way, the staff is helpful, the place is clean and the price is right.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 December 2013,5,Impressive for price,"Stayed in a 10 bed mixed dorm. Overall it was great. Only €4 per night, large and clean spaces, good friendly people. It's more of a backpackers hostel than anything else. Couples may not like it as it's vibe is solo laid back travellers. Met some awesome people here. Guys who run it are good guys. I'd only say maybe skip the breakfast as it's a little poor for the money",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,An Atmosphere of Excellence,"So here I am months later finally writing the review I promised. This hostel is absolutely killer, the atmosphere is hard to describe, it's not exactly a party hostel but you can do anything you would normally be able to do in a hostel like that and more. I was there as part of a group of three and we were accommodated warmly. The staff even went out of their way to take us to the grocery store to ensure we did not get ripped off. It was all the small things that made this hostel memorable. Especially Hassan Bouargane! He was by far the friendliest and went the furthest out of his way to ensure everyone had what they needed. He even helped me track down an item I had lost in the Atlas mountains and it is currently en route being mailed to me! Thanks buddy!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,A fabulous hostel,"Great staff, clean and well located. Definetly one of the best hostels in Marocco. Really friendly and helpful staff made us feel at home. Amazing atmosphere and vibes, definitely going back soon. the roof terrace has a BBQ and plenty of sun. the Manger and Rachid the majic number make the place what it is. Thanks",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,"Great Hostel,Great locations","I stayed at Atlantic Hostel i had great time there I felt like home. Very helpful Staff they always smiling & ready to help.the Hostel is in general good & clean, Wifi is working fine it was an amazing experience i really recommend this place!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,"Great staff, great atmosphere-a home away from home","As soon as my friend and I arrived we immediately felt at home. The staff are amazing and treated us like old friends, really welcoming and keen to get to know each one of their guests. Downstairs is great for chilling out and meeting new friends....we loved it so much we went back and stayed there again after travelling further down the coast, and when we arrived back we were once again welcomed with open arms. It is a little bit hidden in an alleyway within the medina-just look out for the bright blue painting on the wall as you search for the street. Will definitely return!",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,Perfect stay,This is the place I v ever stayed in the world.. Once I arrive the didn't welcome as guest but as a member of a familly. The hostel is very clean and the people working there are the nicest people i mett in maroko. Thanx to Atlantic hostel.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,Great Hostel in Perfect Location with Incredible New Management,"I can honestly say this has been the best hostel staff I have encountered in 3+ years of extensive hostel experience. When I first arrived, Hassan and Rashid welcomed us with open arms and asked our names, where we are from, and about our travels, not to check us in, but to get to know us better. We planned 2 nights originally and ended up staying 5 due to the perfect location, chill atmosphere, and most importantly cool people. The price is right at 5 euros a night, the rooms and beds are clean and all you need, and the atmosphere completely relaxed. I can't emphasize enough how cool the staff were. I would consistently wake up late (like a bad guest) and would still be offered breakfast with a smile. Never were they out to get money from us like a previous review stated. It…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,the best hostel i have ever been,One of the best hostels I've ever stayed at. It's a very welcoming place and both the staff and the are amazingly friendly especially Hassan his always ready to help and giving tips or directions are amazingly friendly. Highly recommend this place.,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 November 2013,5,genial,The entire hostel is really cool. It is very clean and the staff is so nice and helpful even when you got to leave to your next destination at 6am. But get ready to clime some hill and then get up those steps,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 October 2013,5,The Best,"The vibe at Atlantic Hostel is amazing. I stayed there for a week and was treated like family by the owners and the staff. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home, offering tea, arranging nights out, and sitting around smoking together. The upstairs terrace is perfect at night for a view of the city and a cool place to relax and meet other travelers. I would definitely recommed Atlantic Hostel, it's a great value for the price, and breakfast is just 1,99 Euro",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2013,1,Commercial,"It is a really commercial and big hostel. I dont like it. Its expansive. For everything they want money tea coffe breakfast. Breakfast 30 dirham ( 3 euro) but this is expansive in marroc. And normally tea and coffee is free. They are capitalists. I can suggest green milk in essaouira. Nice people, cheaper, small. You fell there like a familiy. and it isnt commercial. Also good cheap food. Its better when you support nice people and small hostels. And you feel more in marroc. In this hostel i felt like in Europe. As well there are not easy going. You have to pay when you arrive and you have to say how long you will stay. You cant be there spontanious. But thats not normal in Marroc. Normally the hostels are not so commercial and easy going like stay or not, leave your backage…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 September 2013,3,Could have skipped this one,"Overall, this hostel is ok... It is definitely not great, but it is not the worst I have ever been. If you are looking to make friends, if you are ok with a ""way-too-laid-back-for-my-taste"" bum lifestyle hostel and don't really mind sleeping on a mattress in the floor, this is the place for you. The price is good, the location also. But other than that, I was not very impressed by it. They don't really care about cleanliness in here either. If we had time to really look around, we could have probably find some place better than this hostel.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2013,4,Laid Back and Lively,"This was an interesting place! I stayed here with 3 friends when on a hiking holiday this spring. It is in a great location and all the staff are really laid back and helpful. Maybe too laid back where serving the food you had ordered was concerned! :) But i liked my time here a lot. It's a great place to mix with other travelers. But, it's maybe not the kind of place to stay if you are looking for some quiet time or are too introverted.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 August 2013,1,The worst hostel of our trip,"My girlfriend and I were looking forward to a relaxing, chilled out time at Hostel Atlantic, having travelled from the vibrant but chaotic Marrakesh. We were greeted by a reasonably friendly (at first) member of staff when we arrived, although things seemed a bit disorganised as he needed us to search through our emails for details of the reservation, rather than having any record himself of who we were and how long we would be there. Still, we gave our details and everything seemed fine. He then asked us to pay in full, up front, before we had seen our room. Alarm bells should have rung at that point, but we did as we were asked and paid the balance. A different guy then led us to our room. We had booked a 'deluxe double' online and uh, there was absolutely nothing deluxe about…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2013,5,The place to stay in Essaouira,What a place. I stayed there as a solo traveller a few months ago and it was terrific. The staff/owners are great and the place was clean and safe. It was a great place to spend a few days; see the beautiful coastal city and meet like-minded travellers. Be sure-it's in a great location right in the market; but set back so it's not noisy. Easy decision- stay there! p.s. Be sure to add your country's flag to the wall!,Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 July 2013,2,Missing honesty,"We came to Essaouira without reservations in hand, and tried our luck with Atlantic Hostel. With a group of six people the hotel manager promised us a really nice room for all of us, they just had to prepare it first with the beds and clean it and we could come back to check it out later. So later we came back and saw the tiniest room of all filled up totally with eight beds (he just put in to extra guests). There were literally no floor space at all. We ended up taking it, because it was at that time to late to finde something else. This guy was clearly just out to make some extra quick money of naive tourists who took all his false selling and courtesy frases for good. A little bit of honesty would have been nice from Atlantic Hostel.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 June 2013,5,Festival!,"If your planning on visiting essaouira during the festival this is the place to stay! Everyones super fun and even though it was crazy busy they always found time to help or just socialise with you. After turning up without a booking the hospitality we recieved was second to none, cant recommend enough.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 April 2013,4,Social Hostel,"My boyfriend and I had a great time here, and met some great people! Lovely social hostel, with roof terrace, and the manager played the guitar for us most nights, which was great and very entertaining! Hot showers, and clean, a little on the noisy side. Just wished they had provided free mint tea like the other hostels, and it would have been perfect! Would definitely come again, as we had such a great time.",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
 February 2013,4,Essential Essaouira,"Not too tricky to find, especially thanks to the huge sign out the front. Really accessible to lots of essential 'sawira things , REALLY comfortable, warm, quiet beds in the dorm, super handy to be able to use the kitchen to make things, lots of lovely space to hang out including the beautiful view from the high terrace. Shower ok. The main guy that worked here was really helpful, but there was one younger guy that was intense and didn't seem to understand the need for personal space- he wanted to watch me do yoga?!?! when I was alone in the dorm room for quiet and invited me to the beach with him a few times. No thanks, mate. Loved Essaouira, 20 dirhim feed of sardines, salad and bread at the port is wonderful. The people just generally didn't give me as much attention here as…",Atlantic_Hostel,Essaouira
