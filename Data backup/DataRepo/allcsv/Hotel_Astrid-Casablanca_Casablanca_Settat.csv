 May 2022,1,It’s worth paying more to stay somewhere else. Badly needs renovation and a deep clean.,We don’t like to write bad reviews so we hope that if anyone from Astrid reads this they take it constructively. Pros: the desk staff did try to be helpful. They seemed friendly although we struggled with communicating. The desk staff let us cancel our three-night booking after the first night without any charge. Cons: the bedding was faded and musty. It was hard to tell how clean it was. The shower was dirty. The air conditioning was broken. There was no remote control for the TV. There was no information in the room about the hotel and its services. The beds themselves were uncomfortable and the hotel generally felt unsafe and dirty. There were banging noises throughout the night and the walls were thin.

 May 2019,5,Just what we needed,"Great little hotel. Location within walking distance of sightseeing objectives. Attentive front staff. Breakfast was orange juice, good coffee, croissant..

 May 2019,4,Great authentic local hotel,"Our experience mirrored Andre B and Ed M. Location was convenient, and the front desk staff was patient and helpful. Room 202 was spacious for our needs.

 May 2018,4,Great little hotel with very good service!,"I enjoyed my short stay here. The breakfast was quite good and the staff was helpful with orientation.

 January 2019,4,Nice Hotel in the city center.,This hotel has very comfortable rooms and is located in the heart of the city. It has an authentic Moroccan feel but is a little on the older side but great for the price. Staff are very welcoming and helpful. The breakfast is good.,Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,1,Really unpleasant stay,"I will say that the front desk staff were kind and friendly! The rest of the hotel was just awful. The sheets on our bed looked used due to traces of different hair on them, and I asked for a new set. I suspect the mattress had bed bugs due to black markings around the edges and then we woke up with several bites. The bathroom is really icky, but not terrible dirty. I think they try to keep the rooms moderately clean, but it still felt really unclean and smelled like toxic cleaners. Super outdated. The rooms did not match what we expected on the site or pictures. I would not recommend staying there, even for the price. We paid 40Euro, and I would have rather spent a few more bucks and not have to guarantee my whole suitcase from possible bed bugs. I am sorry but it just did not…",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,3,Astrid is here but Ingrid wasn't,".........as in Ingrid Bergman of ""Casablanca"".

Not a big deal but everything worked out.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,3,Quite good,I spend three nights in Hotel Astrid. All of them in different rooms. Rooms where good: clean and comfortable. Bathrooms were also very clean but they look used-up and require renovation. The good thing about this hotel is that reception works 24h so there is no problem when you're coming in the night. The worst thing is quite noisy elevator (actually the doors) that kept me waking up in the night when some other guests were coming or going. Also the neighbourhood is not quiet (it's the center of Casablanca) so take ear plugs. The location of Hotel Astrid is very good: it's close to the Place Mohammed V and tramway stop. It is also a short taxi ride from Casa Port railway station where many trains starts or ends. In the neighbourhood of the Hotel there are many places to eat…,Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2016,4,The best of a bad bunch of budget hotel in Casa,"Casablanca is relatively expensive for hotels, Ive tried most of the budget options and this one is probably the best value.

 January 2017,4,My stay at Hotel Astrid,"I spent 4 days here in January 2017. The hotel has a elevator which is rare for hotels or Hostels in Morocco. The Hotel has Wi-Fi that even works upstairs , which is also rare for Moroccan Hotels or Hostels. The hotel is in a central location. The hotel is like 5 blocks away from a tram the station name is ""place Mohammad V "". The hotel is less than 1/2 block away from restaurant Al-Mounia. The beds were comfortable. The hotel has T.V ,a balcony, and serves breakfast for 35 dirhams.

 December 2016,4,Cash ONLY!!! No Credit Cards.,I really enjoyed this hotel. The price and location where perfect for our needs to explore Casablanca. The best part of the hotel is the awesome cappuccino coffee and espresso for only $1 per cup. The worst part was the tiny closet with a toilet inside. It's the perfect size for a small child.,Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,Great deal!,"Staff was helpful, especially with directions - first time in Casablanca = easy to get lost!

Staff is friendly, helpful, good English. Roof terrace is not available. Location is excellent, in the midst of Casa’s Art Deco ‘downtown,’ and a 5-min walk from the tramway stop at Marche Central, fast tram to Casa Voyageurs for train to the airport.

 January 2016,2,Seen better days,"Some places are cheap but provide value for money. This may have been the case for Hotel Astrid in the past but now it is just cheap and nasty. The place has had better days and it is dusty, smelly and dirty. It needs a good vacuum clean and wash. We were given a spacious room on the 4th floor but has some machinery operating all night outside our window which was continually switching on and off. So no sleep. We asked about it in the morning and was told it was a water pump which they would turn of that evening. Nothing happened so that evening we complained and was offered a spare room, tiny with two single beds so ended up staying in our room and another sleepless night.

We were three floors up and it didn't do us any good. There's a local bar or something across the street and it stays boisterous til 11 or so, but if that doesn't keep you up the traffic will.

 November 2015,4,Great staff and quiet room in the bustle of Casablanca,"My room was basic, with a clean ensuite bathroom, but the toilet was a little wobbly when sat upon.

 April 2015,4,Very modest but comfortable place for a last hurrah in Morocco,"We just wanted a place to perch for a last night in Casablanca. Had stayed in the Medina, near the souk in Marrakech and wanted something more basic for a quicker getaway. Ended up staying two nights. I wouldn’t book this one for an extended stay, but it was fine for us for these last two nights. We liked that it was out of the crazy tourist areas and we could explore some of the “regular” parts of Casablanca. Also, it was really close to the streetcar, which we took out to La Pacha Hammam for our last spa.

Upon arriving at the hotel on my first day, the young man at the reception desk was very nice and spoke some English which was helpful. I got a room on the 2nd floor (room 204). The room is pretty small with really old furniture and ugly old bedspreads that are dark colored (making it impossible to tell how clean they really are). The bathroom is a decent size with a tub and a half shower curtain and there is a small balcony where 2 people can stand (if you want to stand close together!).

 March 2015,2,Weak Compared to Other Moroccan Hotels,"The hotel in general was not very home-y, or comfortable. The beds were somewhat stiff, the room smelled heavily of smoke, and the shower had no curtain or wall, meaning that our bathroom floor was somewhat flooded after 2 short showers. It's relatively cheap and is in a decent location, however, it was definitely the weak link among the places we stayed in for similar prices across Morocco.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2014,4,Was Food for an Overnight Stay,"The room was simple but clean and comfortable. It was close to the market and the restaurant next door, considered onsite, was very good.

 August 2014,2,Awful Hotel,"I don't know if it was because Casablanca is such an awful city but I was already well fed up before I even checked into this hotel. ""At least we can just sit in our room for the rest of the night and chill out until the morning"" exclaimed James, hoping to avoid having to spend any time in the city of Casablanca. I nodded and made my way to the room. The first issue we had to deal with was an influx of flies (at least 15) flying in a pack in the middle of the bedroom. This wasn't such a big issue as it allowed us to kill 30 - 45 minutes as we hunted down every fly and destroyed them. After that minor victory we realised that WI-FI didn't work in our room, conveniently it only worked on the first two floors and we were situated on the third floor.

 January 2014,3,Simple and clean,This hotel is just simple and recommended if you stay there and not lounge inside your room or the hotel because you can’t do much inside and there isn’t much amenities to go with it. The rooms are clean and tidy though. Their restaurant was okay. Their interior though is outdated but they had friendly employees who would help you if you needed some guide around Morocco. It’s in the basic location of all the important places too which is a plus. The upside of it all is the price.

Nothing too memorable either positive or negative. It was inexpensive, clean, and had everything we needed for one night. The shower was warm and had good pressure, but was apparently intended for a very short person. The decor was interestingly mismatched, kind of like my grandma decorated it or something. The cable wires were not hooked up and we had to get tape from the front desk to try to tape them together so that we could watch TV, which kind of worked.

The first time I stayed here, my room was on the back side of the hotel, and there was no street noise. The room was also very clean. The second time I stayed, my room was facing the street and was a little nosier. My room was also not quite as clean the second time around (hair in the bathroom, a random bar of soap on the floor in the room). Also, the first stay, the man at the front desk was moderately helpful with giving me information. The second time, the kid at the front desk didn’t understand much English and so I had a difficult time arranging a taxi to the airport with him.

 November 2013,4,Good price/quality ratio,The hotel is very well located and you can visit the historic center on foot. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and its price justified because it avoids a big lunches. You can also pay for an underground parking which is useful if you got a car. The room could have a better soundproofing to cover the sounds of the cobbled street. The staff is great and makes sure that your stay in this hotel is comfortable. Good value for the services provided (we arrived at 11am and we got our room). We recommend it.,Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2013,5,Wonderful experience in Casablanca....,"This hotel was just the sort of thing we were looking for for our stay in Casablanca-- a period hotel that was centrally located--we could walk to almost everything--was in good shape and was very reasonable. We loved the décor--very sort of 1930's and 40's--and gave us the sort of ambiance we wanted to have for this wonderful city. The rooms were clean and in very good shape and the breakfast was a compete treat. They also had free wifi and internet which we had access to without any trouble. We found places to eat and places to shop and just to look at, all within very very easy walking distance of the hotel. And the staff was always there and always helpful. We couldn't have asked for anything more.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2013,4,Cheap hotel in the midst of Casablanca,"We stayed at the Hotel Astrid for two nights during our trip to Morocco and had a lovely stay. Overall the hotel is average, no great amenities or anything but for the price, you can't go wrong! We spent approximately 700 dirhams ($85 Cdn) for two nights. We had hot water at any time and it was never lacking, the washroom was basic but spacious and clean. There were no noticeable issues, granted this is Morocco and standards are different from North America but things were clean and there weren't any questionable items visible. The staff were very friendly, despite language barriers they did try to provide assistance as best as possible.

 August 2013,3,Nothing special,"Stayed here for a night, I wouldn't want to stay any longer. Very old fashioned hotel, decor ugly, A/C didn't work, bath absolutely tiny (not that I wanted to use it), the balcony was filthy. But, it was cheap and the bed was very comfortable. One other comment - we must have asked at least 15 taxis to take us to the hotel in the 24 hours we were in Casablanca - not one had heard of the hotel OR the road it is situated on. That probably says more about the incompetence of the city's taxi drivers, one of whom drove us around aimlessly for 40 minutes, promising we were nearly there - he had no idea where he was going and we ended up jumping out in the middle of town!",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2013,3,absolutely ok for a few days,"I've stayed here for 2 or 3 nights last months when visiting Casablanca and there is neither anything to rave about nor anything to complain: * clean * good location (central, but in a quiet street) * good breakfast * affordable (esp. for Casablanca standards) Next time I'm in Casablanca, I'll probably stay there again.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2013,3,Great for a night,"We had a minor hiccup in our travels and had to quickly find lodging for one night in Casablanca. Hotel Astrid ended up being great for that. The price was reasonable, the location was good and seemed safe. The room and the bathroom were quite large with a lot of natural light. The cleanliness of the room left a bit to be desired though. The wifi worked only in the lobby, but it was quite fast. They had just put in an AC unit in our room, but it wasn't working yet as of July 7. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

 May 2013,4,Nice hotel in good location,This is a nice hotel at a reasonable price for a large city in Morocco. We stayed here two nights as we arrived in country.

 June 2013,4,Pleasant Stay,"We stayed for two nights and had an overall pleasant experience. The Wifi was a little spotty in the room but it worked great in the lobby. The hotel staff was very pleasant and stored our bags even after we checked out and ran to get some lunch. Rooms were very clean. I had originally booked a double bed but was given a twin (perhaps on account of the fact that my traveling companion and I are not married?) but we didn't mind and overall had a very pleasant experience.

 December 2012,3,decent and cheap,"We stayed a couple of nights in December. The place is OK and the price is honest for Casablanca standards. Our room was sunny, with terrace. Some Moroccan decorations. The bathroom needed some reforms; hot water was leaking. Nevertheless breakfast was quite good (we tried many in Morocco) and included croissants! Two useful computers in the hall to check internet. Staff was kind (but not much communicative). One thing was very bad. Though our sheets looked laudered there were long standing stains. And the blankets smelled terribly of sweat (like never washed)!! Now, I really don't care about falling parts or style or missing commodities but SMELLY BLANKETS ARE UNACCEPTABLE!

 January 2013,3,A clean little hotel,"The staf at this little hotel are friendly and adept in several languages. We only had to ask and something was done ASAP. There was a problem with the plumbing in our first room (106). The waste water pipes for the sink and the bidet leaked. At first we thought it was us just splashing around too much ,but we proved that it was the pipework later in the week by filling a sink full of water and letting it drain away (we usually carry a universal plug, as the are often not supplied) water everywhere from the back of the sink. When we told the management they moved us to another room (202). Same problems with the plumbiing, The wash hand basin was cracked and the toilet cubicle had a distinct smell of propane gas at night.

 November 2012,3,Ok for a stop over.,"This hotel is alright, but nothing special. The plus points are its location and its price. Also, the rooms are spacious and the bathroom is of good quality. The negative ones are that i found the staff unfriendly (in fact it was like they were doing me a favour for staying, not that i was a paying guest) and not really that helpful? Might have been a bad 24 hours for them, but i would expect more and got it everywhere else in Morocco? The hotel is the noisest one i have ever stayed in with banging and comotion all night and i wore ear plugs and could still hear a constant banging?

 June 2012,4,"Decent pace, nothing phenomenal","They arrange for airport pick ups, however you have to pay, almost 250 dh. Its a basic hotel offering you comfortable beds. The location is fine, and its not very tough to get taxis all day long. This hotel is value for money. The only problem is in some rooms the Bath tubs are very high and its humanly impossible for shorter or older people to cross over in to the bath tub... plus they dont offer Breakfast!",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2012,3,good value for money but no A/C,"We were visiting in May and stayed here for two nights. Definitely good value for money hotel with basic amenities. I would rate it as a 2* hotel. Good location as well as everything is walking distance with some good restaurants nearby. It had a pretty good wi-fi connection in the lobby as well. One of the major downfalls is that there was no A/C in our room and we were visiting in the summer time. Just if they work on their A/C issue, it would be a great place to stay!",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2012,3,Wasn't anything special,"Hotel Astrid was alright. I wish there was air conditioning in our room as it got a little bit muggy during the day. We had a window and a little balcony though so we were able to create a small draft by opening both of them. There wasn't a whole lot around the hotel to do and at times it was hard finding transportation to places that were further away. The breakfast was pretty average, the rooms were clean. It was pretty cheap though so overall a good value for the money we paid.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2012,2,Simple and cheaply decorated,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Reserved because it is in the Lonely Planet guide and to be honest the Lonely Planet description is very generous. I think we had one of the more basic rooms in this hotel. Very old fashioned and ugly decoration (old faded florals), the bed spread looked very old and worn. We had a little balcony with a two cracked window and badly maintained balcony. The bathroom very cheap (plastic shelf over the sink) and a VERY OLD shower curtain in desperate need of replacing (mould and ripped at the bottom)! Nothing included in the bathroom (no soap). The tv was modern though and the bed was comfortable. This hotel is need of a renovation and a little tlc. The reception staff efficient but not overly friendly. BTW this hotel is located right next to a 'dodgy…",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2012,4,Fairly cheap and central good for all occasions,In a quiet but central area of Casablanca. Hotel fairly cheap but clean and cozy. The staff is courteous and helpful. Near the hotel there is a great restaurant and several other fast food. Good for groups. WIFI available. The staff will arrange a service taxi to the airport which is about an hour from the hotel,Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2010,3,Decent and clean,"It is quite a decent hotel, located close to the city center. Rooms are not very spacious but clean and have comfortable beds. All of them have bathrooms and some of them have balconies. The have free internet access, which definetely is a bonus. Backpackers will find it a good option for staying for a night or two, while they visit Casablanca.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2010,4,"Good budget hotel and best of all, clean!","Nothing fancy or new, but was very clean! The beds were fairly comfortable and the room was quiet. The staff wasn't overly friendly, just quiet and kept to themselves. The location was good, easy cab ride to the train station and a decent walk/short cab ride to the mosque.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2009,2,Only if you're not fussy at all!,"I'm very much a budget traveller so never expect much from my hotel rooms but this place was......grubby. Walls, rugs, sheets, bathrom, everything, run down, shabby and mildewy. The bed was very lumpy and saggy too. Lots of crashing and banging from the rooms above. Additionally, the place was near impossible to find as no-one seemed to know the street it was on! The lobby gives a good impression and that, as well as the free internet terminal, is the best thing about the place. Other than that it's a depressing place to stay, dirty as rhe city that surrounds it.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2009,4,nice place to stay for a limited budget,"we stayed there for 3 nights, the room was ok, the bathroom also, they clean the room and change the towels everyday. The blanket was a little bit dirty, but a double room cost only 30 euro per night. i think it's a deal because it's cheap and central.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2009,3,Decent enough but nothing special,"The room was quite small, and the bathroom was miniature! It did have a nice balcony, although the view from it wasnt great. Free internet access, which is always a bonus. The hotel is quite far from the medina. If you stay in this hotel, I would definitely advise going to the Holiday Restaurant next door. It doesnt look like anything fancy, but the food is very good.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2009,3,Good budget option,"This is no frills hotel. The rooms are clean but bland - they reminded us of a dorm room. The rooms don't have AC, though it was relatively cool at night during our stay. The staff was helpful with our laundry (got it back the next morning and charged us next to nothing) and with dinner and entertainment recommendations for us. It is not luxurious by any means, but it did the job.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2009,3,Does the job...but you may want to consider an upgrade.,"This hotel was fine, but my husband and I felt a little bit uneasy in the neighborhood at night. The rugs and blankets were very dirty too.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2009,4,Pleasant Little Hotel,"This was our first hotel in Morocco. We were very happy that they actually responded to email, so we were able to book ahead. The hotel is located on a small side street behind Place Mohammed V, around the corner from Restaurant al-Mounia. It was walking distance to pretty much everything there is to see and do in Casablanca. We had a triple room on the ground floor. It was very clean, nice bathroom, ample running hot water that can be used for teeth brushing. No AC and no screens on windows meant insect bites. The pigeons are very loud in the morning. We didn't try the breakfast. the reception desk was open 24 hours a day. Free internet in the lobby was a bonus. The total cost was about $20US per person. Overall, we really liked it and had no complaints.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2009,5,Good budget option!,"I stayed only for 1 night but was very comfortable. My room was large, clean, and well-maintained. The bathroom was also spacious & there was plenty of hot water. The only drawback: there is no A/C in the hotel. When I booked my room, I asked for a fan which they provided. You have to do this in advance. Another problem: the hotel doesn't reply to e-mails or takes a long time to do so. I wrote to them from the US but they didn't respond. I then called them from Fes and made the booking. The location is terrific. You are right in the heart of Casablanca where all the action is. And it's an easy taxi ride to the Mosque of Hassan II which you must visit. In short, Hotel AStrid is a solid budget option.",Hotel_Astrid-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Astrid,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
