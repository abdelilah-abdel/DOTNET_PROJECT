 October 2022,1,GETTING KICKED OUT AT CHECK OUT.,"I was issued a handwritten receipt of 70dh at the check in because there was no change n the drawer over my 100dh bill. The receptionist apologised and claimed that the receipt could be redeemed at check out. At check out, still no change. The receptionist advised to wait for a carrier/delivery guy to show because usually they carry cash. I requested the manager. He came shouting: All this fuss for 70dh? And they kicked me out.",hotelName,city
 May 2022,3,Mediocre Hotel,"Check in was good and front door staff was helpful and so was the person behind the reception, got in near midnight and went to room and sleep. Room decor is basic and room size is small and I was given a corner room so not sure how much smaller a standard room it.. I was woken up in morning with curtains as has holes and light coming though it. Air Conditioning was not cooling air even than I set it to the lowest and room was hot and stuffy. The fan in bathroom also didn’t work and steam from shower was heating up the room as well, so became a hot box. I went to reception and told them and no one came to room so called down again and finally someone came up and left… I thought maybe come back but never saw him again. Finally after 2 hours someone came up and explained…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat

Would highly recommend for business visitors. Great breakfast with plenty of choice and meeting facilities are excellent.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat

 January 2020,5,Best experience,Love my trip with family and family enjoyed the time and will definitely go as soon as possible once this covid-19 over to refresh mind and fresh air. Recommend to others who loves traveling different countries and location with family or friends. Love location and people are friendly and services was professional.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 March 2020,4,Nice hotel and staff,"I've been there several weeks in the last 4 months, and the staff is very nice. The hotel is good as well, and very close to the Agdal train station. Rooms are comfortable. I can only complain about one details. The last week the Spanish TV was not working and this was my only entertainment after long working days. I hope they solve it urgently, otherwise I will need to find another hotel.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 February 2020,4,A rather good hotel for business trips to Rabat,"Away from the city center but nevertheless not too far (taxi are available), that hotel is convenient, clean and well maintained. Breakfast is OK, with a good choice. The restaurant is not fabulous, but as no restaurant are available is that rather residential area, it may help if you dont want to take a taxi to downtown.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 March 2019,5,The Service was Great in this Hotel,"I stayed there for three nights, I liked the hotel breakfast it was one of best breakfast in Africa & ME for me, as general the service was great, it is in quiet area and in a good location near the train station.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2019,4,Great value for omnet and a very convenient location,"Stayed in late October in the hotel, it's in a good location near the train station. Breakfast is good but hard to communicate with any staff in English. You need to speak French or Arabic otherwise you would struggle to get the items you need in breakfast or other meals. Rooms are very small and hard to accommodate even a single person. Staff is very welcoming.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 July 2019,5,Great business hotel,We stayed there for a few nights when visiting Rabat for a conference. The service was great. The front ladies were super helpful. The hotel also has one of the best hotel breakfast. Their bread is a must try. The only complain is that the room was quite small for two people. It would be just fine if you travel alone.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2019,5,Mr William Abraham,Found two staff at the reception since yesterday and have been extremely helpful. Both of them helped me out to stay until 6pm today due to my late flight. Soukaina & Oumaima. Lovely two ladies and everything in the hotel is just fantastic. I always stay here and I always get great service. I have also stayed here with friends and they have also always had great treatments.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2019,5,Excellent value Amazing breakfast,"I stayed in Ibis Rabat Agdal for two nights earlier this week. The hotel is in excellent condition with a very nice lobby and facilities. The rooms are European size (small) but it is what I expect at a budget hotel like Ibis. (I’m a diamond member with both Hilton and Marriott). The room was clean and quiet and dark. There were not a lot of little red lights glowing in the night, a great room for sleeping. The breakfast buffet had the best vegan options of any breakfast in the world with lots of cut fruit, fresh orange juice, almond butter and fresh cornmeal pancakes... really amazing. I did have one issue that I expressed to the manager- he apologized and took care of it in a very professional manner. There is no gym, but a great walking area outside. Shopping nearby…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2019,4,Nice change compared to 10 years ago,10 years ago I stayed in the old hotel and had a nice stay. The hotel has been rebuild recently due to the works for the new railway station. I was a nice surprise to stay for 4 days in this hotel. However as it was during the Ramadan I was a bit disappointed with the restaurant as it only offered the special Ramadan buffet and nothing else. Apart from this I really enjoyed my stay.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2019,5,Excellent,"I was organizing a conference in Ibis Hotel in Rabat. It was a very good choice in terms of the hotel (space - very good conference room; food, rooms - clean and nice, and service - very helpful and organized, flexible with our requests). The hotel is located in a great place, next to the train station. I can highly recommend this place.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2019,5,Excellent!!!,Hotel rooms are very neat and state of the art but not too small and not big either! Loved my stay there and the hotel is very close to the train station. Food was amazing as well and hotel staff were great! The conference room is big enough for about 70 plus people and their snacks were nice and tasty. Room service was also great. The cable also works well Thanks Ibis!!,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2019,3,Good value for the money,A simple hotel with everything you might need when in business. Simple but very clean rooms with comfortable mattress and pillows. The rooms are small but space effective. Breakfast has a good selection of almost everything you might find in a city hotel. Very good croissants! Decently a place to consider when in RABAT and if you have transportation. Walking distance to the main rail station.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 March 2019,5,Dinner,"Excellent dinner and beeter attention in the restaurant. Said was our man and he was always helping us. I recommend this hotel to stay and of course to have dinner or lunch. If you are in Rabat, don't miss it",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat

 December 2018,5,absolutely perfect !,"Fantastic hotel, we had the most beautiful holiday, all the staff was great specially the restaurant one. I loved them for being carefull,helpful and very attentive to make you happy with their smile and their fast service It could not be more perfect. Thank you for such a great experience!",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Nice hotel,We stayed here for several nights while visiting Rabat. The hotel was very nice. The morning breakfast buffet had a large selection of items to choose from. The lounge had a good selection of alcoholic beverages including local beer and wines.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2018,5,The best place to be,The staff is very nice (night teams at the top). We felt like home It is a very very good address In a neighborhood full of beautiful things close to. The hotel has been beautifully designed ! Always very comfortable The staff is very professional and very pleasant. The hotel in the afternoon and with all the other hotels in the group is a great initiative to welcome Really hat for all its benefits; a great job for the whole team for a flawless service. It's rare and it's really fun. We want to thank specially the F&B manager YOUNES he is a lovely person and professional.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2018,5,Wonderful surprise!,"When you are abroad, usually you miss your family, your city, your country... So, just a team of professionals can take care of you. I had the opportunity to meet them in the Ibis Hotel Rabat! My congratulations to the Team of the Ibis Hotel Rabat!",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2018,5,A great Ibis,"Hello, One of the best Ibis hotel i have stayed in, very clean and well kept, friendly staff, heartwarming welcome in the restaurant specially breakfast. Highly recommended. Thank u so much IBIS RABAT TEAM.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2018,3,OK hotel,"Good hotel with good breakfast, car parking, good room. I tried to get some information about the city but the reception employee asked to come later when I was already going out !! the A/C is central so if need to trun on the cooling in Nov you can't,. I had to ask them to unsecure my window to open wider to get some air",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2018,4,"Very clean, nice breakfast, helpful staff","I have been told that the hotel was recently renovated (built anew?) and it shows. The rooms are clean, the furniture and the carpet flooring feel new. We stayed here in conjunction with a workshop that we hosted on the premises - it was very convenient for both. Buffet breakfast, lunch, and dinners offer a great selection of food and everything was tasty. Wi Fi worked well - a big plus. The staff were very helpful, kind, and friendly! There is quite a bit of construction going on around the hotel at the moment (a new train station is being built). One can still get around - walk to the train station, hail a taxi, etc. But I think it will be even nicer for the hotel and its guests once construction is over. In sum, this is an excellent option for mid-price/budget hotel, and…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2018,2,Very disappointed,The setting is great. It is a very nice place where you can have different types of drinks BUT the service is terrible. We sat down and the waiter took a long time to bring us the menu.then I had to take my medication and he brought a very cold bottle of water. I asked him to change it and he didn't come back. We went to the counter to ask why he didn't bring it yet and we found out that they put the bottle in some hot water to make it warmer but now it was too hot. I honestly do not recommend it.he came back later when it was already too late to take my medicine and the bottle was too warm and the glass was broken. I do not want to go back there again and neither should anyone.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2018,4,Comfortable and Cheap,"A good quality hotel with very friendly staff. Its location is quite good and above all very economical with decent breakfast. It is close to train station, however taxis can also be arranged, which are quite cheap. I would recommend to any one looking for a budget hotel in Rabat.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Golden,"Nice hotel for my long stay in Rabat Morocco, Personal staff are very helpful with a smile face and alawys in order for any request. Rooms are very clined and organized all the time on top of that the food is delicious.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 August 2018,5,above expectations,"5 days there in August. The hotel is newly built after the original Ibis was bulldozed to make way for a big new Rabat-Agdal train station now under construction. Everything inside the hotel is immaculate, a step up from German Ibises which were traditionally the cheap hotels for overnights next to every train station but are now being upgraded. Wifi powerful. Climate control, elevators, etc., worked fine. Good breakfast buffet. Dinner pretty good, especially salad bar. Nothing special about the neighborhood (residential and offices), but cheap small taxis (for 1-3 persons) are readily available, either flagged down while they pass by the hotel, or at the station a 5 minute walk away.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 February 2018,1,Zero on customer carr,"The hotel is ok but what I’m really surprised and upset is that I had to request the reissue of my receipt after I stayed there, so that my company would reimburse me, and I tried to send a dozen emails along several weeks, call for several days and it was simply impossible to reach them and I never got an answer back. I also contacted Ibis but they didn’t solve my simple problem. Lousy customer care.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2018,5,Superb,The hotel is walking distance from the train station. Breakfast was good. The rooms and bathrooms were super clean. The staff were very cooperative. The club sandwich in the a la carte menu was great for dinner.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 March 2018,5,1 night stay,"Good location, professional staff, loved the room so cozy and comfy bad, the bathroom was clean with hot shower. The bar is quiet and nice they offered us some free tapas, they were about to close but they finally waited for us to enjoy our bottle of red wine. I used to work with Accorhotels and now i experienced staying at one of their hotels.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 February 2018,3,Adequate but nothing overly special,"On arrival, reception staff were not overly friendly, but then, the next morning we saw the same reception staff on as the night before - so I'm guessing they were tired so I'll let them off! I've never stayed in an IBIS hotel before, and to be honest, I won't be rushing back. Our room was fine - nothing amazing but a clean large bed which was a bit hard for our taste - but you can't please everyone. The bathroom was only just big enough really. Could have done with being slightly bigger. The shower door reached the sink nearly which made it tricky getting out of the shower. We were on the fifth floor and couldn't work out the air conditioning to get the room at an ambient temperature. Might have been us making mistakes but this made the room very very hot by morning. We…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 February 2018,5,Great experience through 12 nights !,"I was surprised by IBIS..I realy enjoyed my stay there. my trip to rabat was for 12 nights, i have booked only the first 5 nights. Eventually, i extended for another 7 nights, as i loved the hotel. Rooms are comfortable and clean, and staff were always helpful and friendly. wifi is super also ! I would recommend it for families, couples, and business traveler. Great experience. Thanks to all at IBIS, and special thanks for ""Zohra"" The best house keeper i ever dealt with in all my travels. Omar/ Jordan",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 January 2018,2,"Hotel almost OK, restaurant to be avoided","The hotel is pretty standard. Good position to reach the Agdal station but a bit far from the main center of the Agdal area (avenue de France). The check-in was quite slow because every guest has to fill a card with his personal and travel information, even if an online reservation has been made. This seems to be the rule in Morocco hotels, but still it could be better organized in order to save the guest's time. The room was OK, nice and modern furniture, but with sub-standard equipment: no safe was available, only one big towel and just two small doses of shower gel that were barely sufficient. Poor experience at the bar-restaurant: very long waiting times and significantly higher prices compared to Rabat standards, definitely not worth it. The main dish (tajine) was…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2017,5,Best hotel in Rabat,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for one night and it more than exceeded our expectations. This Ibis felt more like staying in a luxury hotel. It's a super modern, immaculate and extremely well maintained hotel. It appears that Ibis is upgrading its brand and this hotel is a great example of the direction that the hotel is going in. The location of the hotel is good and it is next to one of the main train stations. However, Rabat is a huge city and there isn't really a central place to stay. If you are planning to stay at Ibis then expect to take taxis around the city, which is fine because taxis are incredibly cheap, there are just some traffic issues to consider. Also, the whole area around the hotel is under construction, including the train station which is being renovated.…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2017,3,Good for Business,"A good place for business trip and will be a good location for travelers as the new TGV Station is being build there. Need a bit of walking to find dinning options but if you are lazy, the hotel has a restaurant and bar that serve all types of hot and cold drinks. Room is simple and comfortable but beware to bring your own bottle of water as it is not provided by the hotel. Their laundry service is a let down, my clothes were still wet even when given to them at morning and receiving it late evening. I am an Accor member and until now the Hotel has not recorded my points.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2017,4,Rabat at Christmas,I visited Rabat during Christmas it is a lovely place if you have money.But there are lots of poor people. The bed is comfortable and the room warm in winter. They had a small Christmas tree in the lobby. The breakfast was expensive and not nice. I asked for an omelette but they said no. The choice was scrambled eggs or hard boiled. Cold not warm. I found a nice Restaurant up the road it serves nice omelet’s and expresso coffee for half the price of the hotel and so delicious.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2017,3,One night ibis,"Close to Rabat Agdal train station almost 800m walking , with a contemporary design. This new hotel is a good place if ur a passenger and want a night rest. But there’s nothing to do in the area, plus the big works they doing round make it difficult to find cabs .",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2017,3,Business trip,"Stayed here for a week for a business trip. The hotel is a new one just next to the train station from where you can visit Casablanca or Agadir for instance. The room was pretty small and the air conditioner was not working. Apart from this it had everything I needed, it was clean so all together I consider this place a fair as price/value ratio stay. The kitchen is not the best neither I recommend to go to a restaurant to have breakfast to get the real Moroccan experience.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2017,4,Mr CHO,"It's easy to get this hotel on foot about 5 minutes from Rabat Agdal station. The hotel is new and nice to stay in. The breakfast was enough to energize a new day. The staffs were very warmful, friendly, and helpful. The inside feature of thotel is as same as the IBIS hotel in Casablanca where I stayed in.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2016,5,"Renovated, excellent staff and lovely dining downstairs",With really kind staff and lovely breakfast options and renovated rooms with excellent basic facilities you wont leave your room unless you have to ;) Its also close to the city center and travel options is well arranged from the reception.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 July 2017,3,Could be better...,"To summarise. Receptionist not so welcoming. Was only given 1 access card when there was 2 of us per room. We took out two rooms, 300 and 302. Room is modern, was clean. window view not great, all you can see is construction site. Windows don't stop all out side noise. Can hear trains etc. Correction window wasn't fully locked. TV channels like mbc havnt been reprogrammed so do not work. Other channels arabic work. No safe or small fridge. Room has a/c, didn't use as room wasn't that warm at night. AC grills looked dusty, so expect internal filters to have no bee cleaned. Toilet was clean, no complimentary shower gel, toothpaste or toothbrush. just 2 small sachet of shampoo/ conditioner and small bar of soap. Toilet door has no lock. Doors to rooms are extremely…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2017,3,Average,I visited the hotel few years ago It is now in a new building because they moved few hundred meters for the construction works of the new train station The new hotel is good and well equipped They have good wifi tv in the rooms Nice lobby and bar cofe with average snacks The staff is very friendly and professional But no frogos in the rooms It is situated far from the city: entertainment and shopping area and so on All in all it is average,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2017,1,Worst hotel ever,"I'm shocked that the Accor chain allows this hotel to bear their brand! The staff is very unprofessional. For instance the ashtrays from the night before had not been cleaned and were overflowing with cigarette butts. The sheets in my room were completely wet! There were no hand towels, no shower gel (just a tiny soap bar.) The breakfast was a disgrace: no fresh orange juice! In Morocco this is unheard of! We tried to work last night with a colleague but even inside we were attacked by flying ants... there was no A/C ok the lobby. I do not recommend this hotel at all! Their iftar is overpriced.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2017,4,Modern and nice stay,"I stayed here with my 11 year old son on a quick trip to Rabat. The hotel looked to have been renovated recently and was modern. The team was friendly and front desk spoke English well. Breakfast had several choices and had common Moroccan breakfast items. Our room was very small with very little space to move around. We were simply there to sleep so it was not an issue. If our stay was longer, space would have been a problem.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2017,3,Khalid Ashoor,We stayed there for two nights. Rooms are nice because newly renovated. The service in general is average. Breakfast is poor. Near the railway station. I ordered chicken and the waiter decided to feed me meat.I refused so he decided to bring me a Moroccan chicken dish. He insisted.I did not like the attitude. Will never stay there again.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 January 2017,5,Recently renovated!,"I went the with some friends and place looks really nice after renovations ! Friendly team, best location, available parking, wok kitchen, bigggg screen for soccer lovers ! I do highly recommend this place",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 February 2015,3,Not Great,I had to stay here as part of my pre-booked Morocco adventure. This ibis hotel in unlike the others you would find elsewhere in the world. Its very basic and the rooms desperately need an upgrade. Having said that it was comfortable enough for me to use it only as a base to explore Rabat. Accommodation choices are fairly limited in Rabat so choose carefully when making your booking.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2015,2,Would not stay here again - not many positive things to say about this hotel,"I don't have many positive things to say about this hotel: - rooms were not clean, a lot of mold and mildew in the shower - if you do stay here request a room away from the street, there is ample noise at all hours of the night and on one side is a bus terminal with a lot of taxi's - breakfast was really sub-par with not much of a selection and the exact same thing every day, day after day, when staying someplace for an extended period of time this gets very boring - staff was okay but certainly not great - some English spoken but better if you speak, or are with someone who speaks, French - no elevator so you have to drag your suitcase up the stairs - rooms are average sized, bed was okay, pillows were small and hard - wifi connection was ok - there are a couple of restaurants…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2015,1,people working and hating,"been here and what can i say? the last reviews are accurat. over here the staff of this hotel was extremely arrogant, arriving realized that the hotel also doesn't have any parking, wen asked info on the reception were to park said somewhere, and wen asked were to eat just said hotel, no any other words,,not even a good evening replying to the ones we gave wen entering in the hotel. old place and noisy, with the worst breakfast i had in ibis and the worst not welcome feeling i got in Maroc",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2015,4,Decent hotel. Good breakfast. Wifi OK. Cleanliness an issue.,"Stayed here for 2 days while exploring Rabat. I'd stayed in the Fes Ibis just before and was disappointed, so feared this would be as bad. It was actually much better. Location is good. Right next to the Rabat Agdal train station. Note: this is NOT the central train station close to the Madina, but the one further south in the ""New Town"". So it is far from all the attractions. You might need to take taxis as the nearest tram stop is quite far away. But as it is literally next to the train station there is no shortage of taxis. Disappointingly my room was not clean. There was a lot of hair - on the floor, in the bed, in the bathroom etc. - from a previous occupant that had not been cleaned up. Other than that, things were not bad at all. The usual Ibis facilities and design…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2015,3,Rabat,The staff was very friendly and nice. We had the room nr 228 what was absolutely quite and comfortable. We could check very early and the room was quite clean. Bathroom could be clearer and should include toalett cleaner.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2015,3,Okay no more!!,"Difficult to have a good experience, rooms are okay... Maintenance average... Cleaning less than average... Food better than expected... Service so slowwww but with a smile ! Hope next time in Rabat... I would have a choice to go somewhere else.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2015,2,Miserable night,"Don't accept any room from 134 to 141. There's a taxi rank in the street outside: engines starting, doors slamming, people shouting at all hours. I guess it's the same for 234 to 241. The other side of the building overlooks a substantial garden - make sure to ask for that. Also 134 has a generator or A7C plant or some such on the other side of the wall that made enough noise to keep me awake. And in the adjacent railway station there are two German Shepherd guard dogs that were barking ALL NIGHT. I was grateful for the TV because I certainly didn't get any sleep. Ibis, you might want to rethink the legend on the door key: 'The key to wellbeing' Not so! And you might want to tell your people to SMILE - the young man and young girl working in reception were excellent, as…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2015,4,"Hotel Ibis, Rabat","I had a comfortable room on the ground floor. It was clean and everything in the bathroom worked.The hotel had a very nice garden at the back. The breakfast offered a choice of a continental/ Moroccan food though it was not particularly varied, but it was adequate. The train station was close by, within sight of the hotel. For a budget hotel in Rabat it was a good choice.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2015,3,Overnight stay,"Stayed at the ibis rabat agdal during a quick overnight stay in rabat. Overall the rooms were of a ok size for a double. The stairways and corridor areas looked like they could do with either a good clean or makeover. Our room for some reason had a bad smell from the bathroom possibly to do with the ventilation, but as we arrived late and checked our early we didn't complain, overall staff we're ok and the hotel had a nice outdoor area. We booked the hotel due to its location close to rabat agdal train station.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2015,4,"Nice hotel, nice staff","Very pleasant room, nice big shower with good water pressure. The breakfast is more than adequate. Because I was quite satisfied with the service, food and prices, I didn't even look for a restaurant. The terrace and garden areas are quiet and tranquil in spite of the fact that the train station is right next door. Depending on your reason to be in Rabat, the location may not be 100% ideal. It was perfect for me.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2015,4,"Fine hotel, but problems for non-smokers","Hotel rooms for smokers and non-smokers are distributed throughout the hotel, w/o any seeming rhyme or reason, resulting in smoky rooms for everyone! Please fix this problem by reserving a whole floor, or two wings, fior non-smoker rooms! Then remove the ashtrays in the hall from these non-smoker areas§",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2015,4,good solid stay,Good rooms. Solid breakfast with a choice of western and Moroccan food. Located near the train station which is very convenient And easy to access. Clean. Affordable. Would definitely book and go there again.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2015,3,Convenient basic hotel,"Right next to the train station, which appears to be a good pattern for Ibis hotels in Morocco. Much like other Ibis hotels the rooms are small and basic, and the breakfast selection is quite decent. Ordered room service as well, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food, even factoring in the room service premium. Good to rest your head of a night, but not somewhere you would spend extended amounts of time in. There's also no lift, which means hauling luggage up a couple of flights of stairs if you're on the top (second) floor.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2014,4,Lovely food and great place to stay,"Located right next to the railway station the Ibis Hotel Rabat is a wonderful place to check in. Had a business meeting for 3-4 days . The rooms are soaked in an old world charm. With the walls painted blue and white, the large wooden windows open up to the lush green lawns. Food was awesome. Try the tagines. For the meeting we were pampered with constant supply of pastries and desserts. The staff were courteous . Overall no complaints",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 March 2015,3,Coffee lovers may wish to skip,"I spent a week at the IBIS Moussafir Rabat. While it would have been fine for a couple of days, a week was just too long! Pros: room overlooking the garden was quiet and pleasant; hotel very conveniently located next to the Agdal train station; room clean; staff pleasant. Cons: breakfast buffet quite limited, only one coffee machine which one morning wasn't working at all, and which on other mornings had long lines in front of it; evening menu not very interesting (and half the time there was no fish); uninteresting neighborhood. Colleagues recommended the Le Piétri (reportedly in the same price range) for our next trip.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Pleasant surprise: Nice place to stay,"The IBIS hotel in Rabat is next to the Central Railway station and the building is nice in Moroccan style, with a nice garden for siting outside. I was there on a business trip and consider myself lucky to have booked this hotel. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. (a must in Morocco).The bar was cozy and had ashtrays for smoking, where in the world can you find that nowadays. The beer was good and the free snacks very nice. The bartender and the reception staff deserve a compliment for the excellent service. The room was ok. Good internet connection.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 March 2015,1,You can do WAAAAY better than this hotel.,"I travel extensively - on the road 75% of the time - and can say that you can do a lot better than this hotel anywhere, especially in Rabat. This Ibis does not live up to its name. Normally in a review I would list the Pros and Cons, but there are not many Pros here. Pros: *Hmm, close to the train station? Decent croissants for breakfast? Water pressure was good? Free wifi? Cons: *Cleanliness is in short order. Towels were dingy. There were places in my room that hadn't been swept in weeks. The tables at breakfast were not cleaned though there were many waiters standing around. Silverware and cups were dirty and the serving areas unhygienic (e.g. stains and debris in the silverware trays). *Room are tiny. I could only find a place to open my suitcase by putting it on the desk.…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 February 2015,4,Ibis style,"Ibis is located besides the trainstation Agdal.the hotel has 2 floors and don't have a elevator. The rooms have the quality of a western Ibis,the rooms facing the parking of station are very noisy because the taxi's sound the horn permanently. For me is impossible to stay in this rooms,I think Ibis agdal must make a reduction of 30% at least for these rooms. The rooms facing the garden are nice and much quieter. there are a lot of trains to rabat ville,center and costs 10 dirhams the reception is detached and i don't feel welcome.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2014,4,Very good place,"Stayed there for 3 nights. Very nice and confortable. And the cuisine is exquisite. I found the personel of the hotel very helpful. The hotel is near a train station, which comes very handy for those who have to travel accross the country.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 January 2015,3,Good location. Very helpful staff.,"The hotel is conveniently located near Rabat Agdal railway station. It us a very good value for money. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. Although the rooms are relatively well cleaned the hotel could have some updating especially in common areas. We found bedding (mattress, pillows and duvets) quite uncomfortable and humid.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2014,4,Nice Hotel,Comfortable hotel and well-priced. I have stayed at this hotel twice. I would recommend a room on the upper floor (as opposed to the ground floor) as it is bigger and has a better view. I liked the garden outside - peaceful and picturesque. Minus point is that the restaurant is a little limited in selection.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2014,3,Small.,"The room, as per Ibis, was just about functional with threadbare towels, filthy carpet but we were only staying for a stopover night. The plugs in the room didn't work to charge electronics. The phone (usually not used but we had to change around some reservations) didn't work. Wifi sucked. Close to the train station was the only plus.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2014,1,Stay away!,"This hotel needs to be torn down! How can ibis allow for this ""hotel"" to be a part of Ibis? The receptionists and bar staff are rude and unhelpful. Every part of the hotel stinks of old smoke and cover up perfume. I will never ever ever return to this place.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2014,3,Not in city centre,We got off at the main station only to find that there is two stations in the city and to travel into the main part of town you can get a train for 10 drms less than a euro to the proper station . The hotel was a basic Ibis hotel with the rooms up to the standard Ibis but with large cirarette ashtrays outside in the corridor . Breakfast in hotel 59 drm less than £4 and you had a good choice of hot or cold food and the dinners were good except for the spartan servings which I found to be the case in other Ibis hotels,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2014,2,No Response from Ibis Rabat,"I am travelling to Morocco to meet my fiancé and she recommended Ibis Rabat. I wrote them an email a week ago and nobody responded. I wrote them again twice after this and I still have not received any response. Their website does not display enough photos of the rooms and there is inadequate information about the different types of rooms and rates. My fiancé, who is Moroccan, told me that this is the standard in Morocco, which is really sad.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2014,5,Great hotel!,"All members of our party voted this hotel the best of our trip. It may only be an Ibis, not anything fancy, but it had a wonderfully welcoming feel to it, and the staff were very helpful. Great location, and the Guardien parked us right outside. Being next to the station, it was easy to get a taxi to go around the city. Our room overlooked the beautiful garden. We ate in the restaurant which was very nice, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Rabat. It has a real authentic Moroccan feeling, without sacrificing any of the comforts you would expect. We did have a wry smile about the wonky light switches though ;-) Maybe next time we will take them a spirit level as a present!",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2014,3,What you'd expect,"Hotel is a little out of town but connections are easy and frequent via taxi, tram or train. Rooms facing the courtyard are significantly quieter than those facing the station square, though it was not overly noisy, despite the busy area. Rooms could benefit from an update, aspects are looking a bit tired, but it was clean, safe and comfortable - exactly what you would expect from Ibis.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2014,5,I love this hotel,"The only thing missing was thicker towels. The location is really great. Right next door is the train station and you can have a coffee or lunch there at super low cost. I really liked the reception and it was a super safe location. It does not have a pool but the garden is really lovely and if you have to eat at the hotel, the food is lovely. Good strong wi fi. I actually really liked this hotel alot. I would definitely recommend it as a good safe clean stay",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2013,3,"Nice and safe, missing a pool","It's a good base for a meeting, very nice garden but missing a pool...good breakfast, food also ok, but not special. Rooms comfortable but missing the little bit extra, but a safe and relaxing hotel if a short business stay!",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 August 2014,4,A good stay in Rabat,"The ibis Rabat is on a good location close to the railway station and ideal for train-travellers like us. The rooms including the bath are clean, the bed comfortable and the climatisation works good. Also breakfast and the work at check-in-desk was o.k.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 August 2014,1,Ants in 2 different rooms on my first 2 nights stay. Hotel refused to lock left baggage room even after my complaint!,"I stayed at Ibis Rabat for 3 nights with over 30 others because of a wedding weekend. I was horrified to discover that I slept with ants not only on my room side board table but also in my bed and asked to be moved which Driss Nahid (Deputy Manager) did as requested the next day. I was assured that there will be no ants in my new room after the inconvenience that I had to pack and unpack and sure enough, I discovered ants again in the 2nd room. I was then moved again and unfortunately I had no choice but to stay for another night with the wedding guests on the 3rd night but fortunately the room was ant free. I regretted staying at this Ibis. The manager agreed to refund my 1st night but as expected this had not been received. He refused to refund me for the other nights even…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 August 2014,2,poor service,"stayed there for a night, the service was soo poor during breakfast, there is a lady there who thinks she owns the restaurant and treating people in a very rude way. you must put some efforts into training your staff.... it would help you serve better",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 August 2014,3,Stayed twice at the same hotel within a month,First time was in June 28th 2014 and wasn't happy at all. Poor service and room was totally uncomfortable . However went again in July 29th 2014 and service was much better and there is a gentleman with the name of Zakaria on reception desk he was very helpful,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2014,3,Friendly reception,"An Ibis-Hotel as usual. So far nothing special, because you know what you get. But the reception was really very friendly, specially the young man in the late shift was absolutely wonderful. He arranged airport shuttle for me and helped me a lot.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2014,2,Not the normal IBIS standard,"Stayed 2 nights. Stayed at many Accor hotels and experienced lower standards in morocco, location was good, but hotel Employees at reception desk were rude. No elevator need to take stairs, Room was almost the general IBIS standard (can't complain) however, the bathroom was worn down and the toilet seat was broken which they fixed, had 1 soap & 2 Sachs shampoo hardly enough for one person. Breakfast had few choices and food was not great but the sitting area outside was very nice (go to nearby restaurants). Gave them my loyalty card at check-in they said they registered it but discovered that they haven't done so. There are better hotels in Rabat. Would not stay at this location again.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2014,5,Very good hotel,"My stay was great. I had a 4day meeting there. The room was good even if the bathroom floor wasn't clean enough...apart from that, the staff was very efficient (especially the waiters and waitress) and they did everything they could to please us. The garden is really nice and it was nice having our meals there. As a vegetarian I was afraid meals would be boring but for 4 days we had different and tasty vegetarian meals. We also use the conference rooms and coffee breaks and everything was clean and good.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2014,5,Stay AT Ibis Rabat,Ibis hotel is very convenient near the railway station.It is go come by rail or bus from Casablanca and then use the blue taxi to go around town. The room is clean with enough towels . The breakfast is copious for 5 euros. The gentleman at the reception was very helpful. I was impressed how meticulous about safety.The rate was fair in view of the week celebration taking place in Rabat and the cost of hotels were prohibitive. I paid 63 euros.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2014,3,Ok for a short stay,"The Ibis is ok for a short stay provided you are not sharing a room. The very comfortable but very large bed takes up most of the available space. To move from the window to the bathroom means inching your way between the bed and the closet or crawling across the bed. I chose the latter. Toiletries (one small bar of soap and two shampoos) and towels are adequate for one but not two guests. There is no usable workspace. Breakfast is only average and I recommend skipping the restaurant's other meals. There are many restaurants in walking distance - go out of the hotel, turn left and go to the end of the road. Turn right and you are on one of the area's busiest streets. Service at check-in was polite, but service in the restaurant and bar is awful. It is very hard to get a server's…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2014,3,Disappointed,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. 1-staff : I could tell that they have never been trained or maybe they are not bothered to give effort . I booked this hotel through thomas cook in uk . When im checking out they spent like 30 min checking my booking so how they let me on on the first place. Simply they have no clue !. Plus they don't know how to show respect 2-the restuarent : poor 3- room: clean. Toilet : why they provide only one small soap and two small sachet shampoo for a room for couple ! Expecting us to have one time shower aday! 3- why I rated average ? Because the location and the clean room but for the money I paid I can find better hotel for sure so I don't think om going back again to it Ibiz management :please send someone their for unexpected visit , this…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2014,1,Substandard disappointment for the IBIS brand,"Perhaps a good location close to train station, but otherwise not much going for it. Compared with other IBIS hotels I've stayed in, the service is rubbish to non-existent. Upon arrival, it felt like I was inconveniencing the staff at reception by showing up. Bed is clean and comfortable and AC is blissfully quiet, but room is tiny, bathroom is grubby, there is no drinking water provided, no kettle or tea in room, not even a box of facial tissues, and shampoo comes in little tearable (pun intended) sachets that you'd more likely find in a budget hostel. And of course no elevator. The restaurant is to be avoided. It was a mistake to decide to avoid the walk to nearby restaurants and go there. I waited ages for a filet de sole meuniere that ended up being little more…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2013,3,OK for an overnight stay,"Hotel close to the town centre and nearby to the train station. Easy to obtain taxis. Large open air carpark next to the hotel, price very cheap. Hotel itself - No lift which means carrying baggage up a narrow spiral stairs. Room small but clean. OK for an overnight stay. Restaurant decor seem like a works canteen. Breakfast OK however, supplies need continually stocking up, the client should not need to ask. Would stay again.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 February 2014,3,Not the standard quality of IBIS network,"I spent two nights in the Hotel. I was first surprised when I have been told that there were no lift in the hotel. The room was small but calm with a nice view on the garden. The bed was comfortable, but the shower was ugly and looks really dirty. Honestly, I did not expect such low quality for an IBIS hotel, famous for the high quality meeting the expectations of tough customers.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 January 2014,2,General disappointment,Generally disappointing. There is no lift in the hotel so you have to carry your luggage up the awkward staircase. My room had one damp wall - it was wet when I touched it. No drinking water provided in the room and no tea or coffee making facilities. I found the opening and closing hours of the restaurant inconvenient - no possibility of having dinner before 7.30pm. Despite the extravagant claims on the brochure in the room the breakfast buffet is very basic - the only cooked dish available on each of the three mornings I stayed there was watery scrambled egg. The staircase carpet was dirty when I arrived and stayed like that for three days.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2013,4,Budget and basic but meets my expectations,"I read the previous reviews but booked despite the negative comments. Arrived in anticipation of a bad hotel but i was pleasantly surprised. Not sure if it was because I had really low expectation that whatever I got would have exceeded my low expectation... It was an Ibis so i expected a basic budget hotel which it ticks all the boxes too. Not sure if the previous reviewers expected a lot more but this is an Ibis at the end of the day so expect an ibis experience. On plus side Clean room, not too noisy, basic but plentiful breakfast and efficient staff. Location excellent as next door to railway station though we arrived by car so didn't take advantage of this On negative side Room had a bit of condensation issue (windows dripping first thing in the morning) and no lift…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 August 2013,3,"my last stay in Ibis, Rabat","the carpets on the stairs and hallways looked dirty. the hallway leading to the room had a weird smell and is not something refreshing. room was adequate with a great view of the garden, shower is small but comfortable. lacking of toothpaste and soaps. we occupied a double room but they only put 1 pc. of soap and 2 sachets of shampoo. the lady at the counter was not wearing presentable uniform, saw her wearing slippers and was not smiling at all. the tone of her voice was not friendly, sounding like she was interrogating.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 July 2013,4,Near to the Agdal Station,"Nice, European like hotel. Next to the Rabat Agdal station and some 25 mins walk to the center of Rabat. Nice staff and clean rooms. Good base to go and visit other cities and to go south of Rabat to beaches.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2013,4,Good sleep before & after tour,"This hotel offered good comfortable beds 2 x's; upon arrival after Trans Atlantic + connecting flight into Rabat & before leaving to return home, after our group holiday tour of southern Morocco. The rooms are a little cramped for luggage for 2 (twin room) but the shower was large & good hot water. There was some evening voices noise from the terrace but okay when window shut & AC was in good working order. I noticed some tiny ants on the desk on the 2nd visit. The buffet breakfast was very full with choices of breads & pastries, toast, jams, olives, cold cuts, scrambled eggs, fresh squeezed OJ, cold cereal, fruits, choice of coffees & tea They accommodated our need for 5am breakfast before flight departure with much of above buffet, cereal, pastries, hard boiled eggs, fresh…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2013,1,Overrated/overprice poor quality One star hotel,"This might be good value for a one star hotel, but absolutely terrible for a 3 star hotel. carpet is very old and not clean, hallways don't seem to have been painted or cleaned in ages, cheap soap, no iron in the room, rooms had bad odor, rooms are too small. staff were friendly but failed to follow up on my request. i would not recommend this to anyone, but unfortunately, luck of choices of better hotels in Rabat, make this one a better option",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 March 2013,3,Simple but adequate,"It is a very simple, and small hotel. Next to the Rabat Agdal railway station, which makes access to other towns like Fes and Marrakesh is easy by train. Taxis are also accessible just outside the hotel. But do not expect a mini bar or other facilities that you can find in a five stars. Groceries stores are nearby, at a walking distant you can find a small Carrefour. But if you want to go shopping, the Medinah is about 15 minutes taxi drive at the cost of about Moroccan Dirhams 20. The staff of the hotel is not too friendly, but they are also not rude. Do not expect greetings from them, they will just let you pass by ignored. If you ask directions, they may help you out. But if you want to make small changes in order to pay for the taxis, they will say that they do not do…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 March 2013,4,A good stay at IBIS Rabat,"After a difficult drive in strong winds and torrential rain from Tanger Mad ferry terminal, it was a delight to arrive at the guarded car park with plenty of spaces next to the hotel. The hotel was immaculate and quiet; the staff very helpful if sometimes a little aloof. A small problem with the bill was quickly and politely reolved. The hotel is in a good area and well served by an abundance of inexpensive taxis at the nearby station. Not delux but well up the IBIS standard. We'd certainly stay again.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 January 2013,3,Good decent option,Well located near the train station though a bit far from the town centre and the medina. Basic infrastructure but quite clean and comfortable. Small clean rooms. Bring your own toiletries! Good breakfast. Food at the restaurant average. Recommended for a low-medium budget though I would personally suggest something closer to the old city.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2012,5,Pleasant Stay at IBIS Rabat,"It was a great experience to be at IBIS, Rabat except for small rooms. They can make the stay more comfortable by providing small towels and tissue papers. Good value for money. The choice of food for Indian Vegetarians is very limited.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2012,4,Excellent location for a trip to/from train station,"This is a great/cheap place to stay for an overnight stop in Rabat if you are traveling by train, as the hotel is right next to the Rabat train station. The room was clean, though small, and there were no problems with our reservation. The hotel restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is simple pastries and fruit, dinner is good (tagines, French cuisine, etc) but pricey. You can order alcohol at the bar if you wish, though the prices looked expensive. Taxis are plentiful, since the hotel is next to the train station, so it's easy to get around town. Note that to get to the airport you'll need a Gran Taxi, which you must reserve (the hotel will do it for you) as the petit taxis at the station cannot drive to the Rabat airport. For a long stay in Rabat there…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2012,3,Average,"A very average Ibis, the sheets could have been cleaner. Not difficult to get to Rabat Ville on the tram, by taxi, or by train. My wife had the smell of the sheets over her after sleeping for one night. The sheets were not fresh and clean, something that guests can expect for MAD 488, the reduced price that we paid.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2012,4,Good choice for working visits.,"A good choice for working visits at a reasonable price. This hotel has a good location near of train station (nowadays morroco has a good net between main citys and a good internal net of tramway), if you feel lack of anything, my advice is a visit to the tiny grocery in front (a show). Meals with normal prices, adequated to ocidental needs. A good garden where you could apreciatte a local beer at the end of afternoon. Only misses a pool.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2012,2,Not great,"I stayed here on business. The food in the hotel is fairly good. After that, there is not much else impressive about the place. The rooms feel like student accommodations, with plastic carpets. The only reason to stay here would be if you just have a quick business meeting to deal with in Rabat, but even then there are better options. All this hotel needs is a solid renovation and it could be quite nice.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2012,4,good location near the railroad station,this is a good hotel as well for business purpose as for tourism since it is located near the train station. It is also easily accessible by car or by taxi. the price /quality and service are also very good.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 August 2012,4,"good value, little cultural vibe","the hotel was nice and simple and very close to the train station. I guess, my preference was to stay at a more traditional place (like a riad), given it was Morocco. In that way, the hotel was rather Western with little traditional decor or vibe. However, given the room rate, it was a good and convenient choice.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2012,3,Rabat from the bottom South,This hotel has a good location thinking of train. Besides that it is in the far south of Rabat center with not so much to see nearby. Staff is helpful but attention that it has no lift. Our room was on the same side as the restaurant so some noise would disturb. A taxi or train must be taken to center as walking is an adventure not many people want to do (even locals). Safe and an option to take for lower budget.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2011,3,"close to the airport, so locationwise it is ok","Stayed there for a week. Service was ok, staff did not go the extra mile to help. They would quite happily chat to their colleagues while you wait at the reception to ask a question. The breakfast was ok, tea was extra sweet and they would not make tea without sugar for those who cannot have too many sweet drinks/food. The room was clean, not very spacious. It was difficult to work because of the busy train station and car park next to the hotel. But in general, it was fine.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2012,1,"Very, very disappointed","I arrived very early in the morning at 03.20 to find ants and other insects crawling in the room and the bathroom sink. The floor had bits all over and I was concerned about walking barefoot on it, so consequently kept my shoes on at all times and the sink also contained someone's beard detritus as well as hair. Despite asking the receptionist next morning to have my room thoroughly cleaned and although someone did try to do something, the hair and beard 'clippings' remained by the next evening. Thoroughly insalubrious and unsavoury. I would never stay there again (or even in another Ibis hotel) and certainly would not recommend it to anybody.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2012,4,great value and location,"As ever, an Ibis proves its worth. Difficult to find but very central and with a lovely garden. No pool or parking which was a bit of a drag, though there is a car park next door. Friendly service, adequate breakfast, small but ok.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2012,3,"Nice hotel, but nothing to do around there","The hotel is conveniently located next to the Rabat Agdal train station (not to be confused with the more central ""Rabat-Ville"" station). It is perfect if you are arriving on a late train or have to leave very early in the morning, otherwise I would opt for a more central location, either in the Medina or in the Ville Nouvelle, where all the restaurants, cafés and other interesting sites are located. Rooms are small but OK, in the usual ""international hotel chain"" style. Wifi internet only works in the hall, something that I think could easily be improved. You only get one towel and one tiny shampoo bag per person, plus one soap per room. There is NO elevator, which may be just a hassle if you carry heavy luggage, and a serious problem if you are mobility restricted. You…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2012,4,Quieter and better than expected,"Litterally a stone's throw from Agdal station, we were pleasantly surprised by the silence!! Staff was nice, room was fine, a little small but clean. We spent just one night and it was perfect for our needs.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2011,3,This place was ok,I came here for my last stop before flying back to Spain and it was an alright experience. There was a decent restaurant and it was close to many attractions.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 January 2012,4,Convenient and comfortable,"The hotel, like other Ibis hotels, is perfectly situated for stopping at Rabat by train (Agdal station) as we did. We found the hotel itself to be clean and well appointed and enjoyed a good night's sleep following a cheap Riad in Marrakech! It's rather basic and characterless as you might imagine, and the staff weren't especially helpful, but good for a one-night stay-over.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2011,3,Ibis Rabat Agdal Dec 2011,"The hotel is equivalent to a motel 6 I suppose (haven't been to one in about 15 years or more). Definitely not a 3 star which would be equivalent to embassy suites in USA. The hotel is literally next to the Rabat Agadal train station. So that makes it convenient to stay. The staff was friendly and very approachable. The rooms are basic and were clean. If you just need a clean place to crash, then this would be it. However, at $74 a night, I would expect the quality of rooms and decor similar to US embassy suites or Crown Sterling. The hotel does have a bar and cafe. Although, the prices seem modest when coming from US (due to the currency advantage), but you would be better off to experience the ethnic cuisine outside for a fraction of the cost. All in all not bad. Would…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2011,4,basic rooms good location,"The rooms are basic İbis standard,it's clean and comformy.The location is good,we used tram to go centre and tram is the best way to explore Rabat.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat

 November 2011,5,"Perfect for just short stays, basic rooms","Staff were very polite, room was clean and smelt very fresh as we first walked in. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast was a buffet with a good range of food, ideal for a short stay. Not so good for a long stay I shouldn't think as the rooms offer very basic amenities ie. Shower bed wardrobe.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 August 2011,2,Noisy renovations,We stayed at the Ibis in Fes and this hotel is exactly the same. The rooms are relatively small but comfortable and clean. There is also free internet - it is tucked away by the conference rooms! The location is right next to Rabat Agdal train station. However the hotel itself is far from the historical sites so I would recommend getting a petit taxi. The hotel would have been fine but for the noisy renovation work which was taking place (between 9/10am - 5pm). We walked around the different floors to see if we could find a quieter room but it was noisy on every floor. In the end we checked out on the same day to go to stay at another hotel within the Accor hotel group. Normally last minute cancellations incur a charge but the hotel agreed to waive this under these circumstances.,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 July 2011,4,Next to train station,"This hotel is next door to the Agdal Rabat rail station not the Rabat Ville main rail station. This is only one stop before the end of the rail line. The first room they gave us was dirty, especially the carpet. So I went down stairs to the front desk to complain and they gave me a new room. The new room was nice, clean and bigger. It's a perfect hotel if you want to be next to a train station, but you have to either get back on the train or take a taxi to the main city center. A taxi will only cost you about 20dr to get to the Rabat Ville Train station, this is the main place to be and the heart of the city. All the restaurants, museums and stores are in this area.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2011,3,"Solid. Near the train station, but away from center of city.","The Ibis was a solid place to stay. Located very near the train station, it was easy to access when coming in. We found it easy to access the city by mini taxi (blue cars, cheaper), but it is not within walking distance of any sites. In other Moroccan cities, we stayed in non-chain hotels and found them to be a much better experience. But, this is certainly comfortable and clean. IMPORTANT note: if you choose the Ibis and want to explore the city, (1) get a taxi in front of the hotel, not in front of the train station, which is a tourist trap; (2) try to get a taxi that someone has just left because they won't be as likely to over-charge you to compensate for the time they've been sitting, (3) refuse any taxi that doesn't have or won't use a meter. All our taxi rides were under…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 May 2011,2,It lets down the brand,"We've stayed in a number Ibis hotels in the past year, and this property ranks as the worst. It's not necessarily bad, but it's bad for an Ibis. The rooms are quite and reasonably-sized, although they could be cleaner. (Mostly the problem lies in the bathroom: the shower had black mold growing in it, and hairs from the last customer had been left in the sink.) The beds themselves were fine, although sometimes the pillowcases smelled of tobacco. Given the reasonable prices, I would have handed Ibis Moussafir four stars, were it not for the staff. A surly lady greeted us at checking, and seemed offended when we asked her if she had more than one pen that we could use to fill out our check-in forms. The bartender is neglectful in the extreme: trying to get his attention for a…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2010,4,Good Place to Stay,If you like staying in a place where there are no surprises..then this is the place. It is nothing special but compared to what horrible places you could end up...I give it a secure Thumbs Up!!!,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2010,3,Average hotel,"I have used it for 3 nights, and it served as a base to explore this and other citys. It is not easy to find it, it is not near the center. A Decent hotel, with decent and very simple rooms for a decent price (when compared with other hotels in the same country) were you can get a good night sleep. The breakfast is good enough, but it could had more variety. it´s a pity that there isn´t a pool. Apart from the works that they were doing at that time, and the fact that very few people spoke english, i don´t have nothing bad to say. If you can speak a little french, and if you are not too picky, i recommend you this hotel",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2010,3,Reasonable short stay hotel,"In a reasonable location to visit central Rabat, petite taxi from the front door to the city centre only 12 diram, very good local restaurants and shopping a short walk from the hotel in Agbal. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only down side for us was the constant noise from the air conditioning throughout the hotel during the night that caused us to have interupted sleep. We complained but the problem could not be rectified. However we still enjoyed the hotel",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2010,4,Stay in Le Diwan Rabat,"It is nice hotel with friendly staff. The only minus is that there is no swimming pool or sauna. This hotel is good for business trip. Rather far from medine, but you can go there by foot. Very nice rooms with big beds. Total: it is good to stay there.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2010,4,Good choice,"Localization: The hotel is really very close to the train station (Gare Rabat Agdal), 50 meters walking. I arrived really tired and it was a pleasure to the eyes to see the hotel in front of me! You can reach the city center easily, by train (5 minutes) to the Gare Rabat-Ville, or taking a taxi (right in front of the hotel has a taxi stop). Cleanness: The hotel is not luxurious but its good to sleep, the bed is good! The cleanness could be better but was good enough. Internet: The Internet is accessible only from the lounge area and not in the rooms as said in the description. The velocity is sufficient to check the email e some pages but not to maintain a skype conversation for long time.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 July 2010,4,"Great location, close to train station, basic hotel","This hotel in Rabat seems to be of a similar standard style of the maroccan Ibis hotels. We booked one night in the internet for a nice price. The room we stayed was newly renovated, and was comfortable for a short stay. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as there are many shops in the souq and the city center! The room was very quiet (you can't hear the trains), and it was clean. You got parking for 5Dh and free internet access! The staff was very helpful!",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 April 2010,2,Overpriced,"Dissapointing quality for the price. Arrived as a tired traveller, first room allocated hadn't even been cleaned, moved with no apology and second one didn't have towels initially nor did shower appear to have been cleaned. Secure parking for motorbike was appreciated however. Internet access (with machines) was also good feature. Breakfast was fine. Staff functional but not particularly welcoming. Restaurant staff in particular verging on the dismissive. Would not return.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 October 2009,2,"Basic at best, manageable for one night","Booked this hotel on the premise of reasonable reviews and decided to take the risk, based on the cost and the fact that you can’t go much wrong with a chain in an unfamiliar country. Not the best decision ever made as it turned out to be not so good value for money. Stayed here 1st weekend of October 2009. The good Location – next to ONCF Rabat station so excellent if your onward journey is by train from AGDAL. Hotel is a nightmare to find by car though. Had breakfast on the lawn as a consequence of repair works going on in breakfast room, this was an accidental bonus. 24 hrs room service was advertised as available but didn’t use it. Wide selection (multi-national) TV channels with reasonable size TV. Not so good Reception staff were rude and generally not courteous during…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 January 2009,3,Not bad at all.,"I stayed here for 10 days while working in Rabat earlier this year. Hotel was clean, rooms average quality and clean. Hotel grounds nice with outdoor green area out back. Food at the hotel restaurant was excellent. Front desk staff were friendly and spoke some English. Only criticisms: bartending staff was generally unfriendly even when tipped adequately. Wireless only worked well in the business office, and sporadically in the bar area. Did not work in the room.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2007,3,Generic Chain Hotel- Perfectly fine,"This is a basic chain hotel. They didn’t have enough dishes or food for the breakfast buffet but otherwise, no complaints.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 December 2008,4,Nice stay,"Everything new (not as in many other 3 star hotels in Morocco) and clean. Unfortunately the location of the hotel is not that good. It is in front of the train station and you have to drive by car or taxi to the Medina, since it’s to far away to walk. We paid around 47 EUR for a double room (breakfast not included), what’s not that cheap for Morocco.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2008,3,It was ok,"I think the hotel was ok. After all the troubles i went through in Morocco..this place felt safe and clean. Most of the staff could speak at least a little bit of English. Some of them were really nice, some of them quite rude. The breakfast was ok, but after having the same breakfast every day we needed something for a change:)",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2008,3,not a bad hotel,"On my fourth visit I stayed in this hotel. It was my first time to stay in a hotel of this chain and I found it to be quite acceptable. Cleanliness was good and the staff were friendly and efficient and someone always had sufficient english ( and I noticed spanish as well ) to deal with any queries. I did have a problem one night with a noisey fellow guest upstairs but the staff changed my room the following day without any hesitation. The hotel is just a few yards from the station but without too much noise from the passing trains. I was not too impressed with the food, but it was adequate and the quiet terrace adjoining the bar and restaurant is pretty and quiet.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 July 2007,1,Ibis Horribilis,"Do not stay at this hotel. On arrival we were forced to pay up front for one night's stay. Once checked in we were forced to carry our bags up the steep stairs as there was no bell boy willing to help us and no lift. On entering our room we noticed that the switch on the A/C had broken and we couldn't turn the A/C on. After complaining we went straight out to the sites as we wanted to see as many sites as we could, only having an afternoon. When we arrived back to our room we turned on the A/C, which was now fixed. After getting ready to go out for dinner we started to notice a faint eggy smell that seemed to be getting worse. We went out for our meal and on our return the smell had got worse. We weren't sure if the A/C was the source or there was a leaky sewage pipe but either…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 November 2006,3,Convenient & basic,"This hotel was exactly what you expect from an Ibis. Very standard, clean, and basic. The check in staff spoke English, but weren't overly friendly or helpful. The location was good, walking distance from the train station, and only a 50pence taxi ride in town or the medina.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 September 2006,2,Ramadan death knell,Stayed here two nights with my wife near the start of Ramadan as we were departing Morocco. Rooms were higher quality than Casablanca but staff here were even less helpful than Casa. The hotel contained no gin even though the bar was serving alcoholic drinks to guests. The local bottled beer was flat. The restaurant was appalling - we had to ask reception staff to arouse the waiters in order to get seated. Ramadan was not a good time to stay at this hotel,Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 June 2006,1,"Don't book at Ibis, Rabat through Internet !","Be careful! I booked a night at Ibis, Rabat through Internet, and submitted my credit card details for the payment to the company Go Voyage. Upon my arrival at the hotel in Rabat, I was told that this was just for ""making a reservation"" but that I still had to pay on the spot, which I did. I had to pay in cash, because their system would not accept my Visa card, they claimed. To my surprise, I discovered upon my return home that my credit card had been debited as well. Difficult to imagine that this is just a ""misunderstanding"", since these booking-payment systems ar obviously ""a system"" that the staff must know.",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
 January 2006,2,Facilities are fine - Service was horrible,"Ibis Moussafir is a pretty good chain, it's like the Holiday Inn of Morocco. I also stayed at the Ibis in Casablanca with no problems. My room in Rabat was almost a carbon copy of the one in Casablanca, nice and comfortable. However, the staff at the Rabat Ibis were among the most incompetent I have ever encountered in my travels across the globe. Luckily, I have generally encountered good service, so they weren't a nightmare, but were a headache. The check-in staff were rude, and when I later tried to get some food (the immediate area of the hotel is residential) and the people in the restaurant worked at a snails pace for substandard food. The location of the hotel is not ideal, it is located near the Agdal station, which is not in the centre of Rabat, and it can be hard to…",Ibis_Rabat_Agdal,Rabat
