 October 2022,5,"Amazing riad, a must when visiting Morocco","There are no words to describe this amazing riad, or better say magical castle! It is incredibly decorated, both in the common spaces and the rooms. The food is authentic and you can not imagine how delicious it is, both breakfast and dinner! But above all is the warm hospitality that will truly make you feel like you are with family. I highly recommend staying here.

 September 2022,4,Great place to stay,"I stayed here for two nights as part of a group travelling through Morocco. The staff were all friendly and helpful, and one young woman serving us our meals was particularly helpful - I’m sorry I didn’t get her name. Our meals were served in the courtyard, a pleasant oasis in the heat. The food was delicious and well prepared. The pool was a nice place to cool off after a long day outside the hotel. My room had everything I needed, although it was dark due to having only two small windows. But every room in the hotel is different and some rooms had great views over the town and surrounding area.

Every room, every detail is thoughtfully designed to convey the ambiance of an oasis in the desert. I encourage you reserve a room with a balcony, otherwise the inside rooms can feel rather claustrophobic. The pool is also quite small, but suffices as a way to cool off from the dusty heat. Breakfast was excellent and full of delicious variety. The only down-side is that the B&B's secluded location makes it costly to taxi back and forth to the town of Ouarzazate or the airport.

Regarding food - dinner was ok plus, only downside was the chicken that was served for main course to us (other guests got couscous,guess i needed to request, although i thing you should not make differences between guest. I am in Morroco- i want local food not chicken! ) . Breakfast was nice but here again they offer regular omlette and not for example berber omlette which is local!

 November 2019,5,Quite simply amazing - a unique place,"This was by far and away our best accommodation in our Moroccan holiday. Dar Daif is a beautifully restored traditional Kasbah. I kept wanting to take photos again and again as we ascended from the courtyard ‘oasis-like’ garden to the public areas in the upper floors, all of which were tastefully and expensively furnished. Exploring each room was fascinating and a delight which lingers in the memory (just see the photos). There were a number of terraces from where there were fine views of the High Atlas and the surrounding desert. The bedrooms were comfortable. We had an enjoyable Tajine in the evening and a good breakfast. Dar Daif is well worthy of its 5 stars. The staff were very welcoming.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 November 2019,5,An oasis,Amazing Spent a night here on a 6 day motorcycle trip around Morroco with a group of friends.

Also, the accompanying teams when you go for a trek are exceptional human beings, for their wisdom and their empathy. In this oasis, I’d like to point out in particular: - The charm of each and every room, each with its own soul - The magnificence of every common space and terrasse - The generosity and deliciousness when it comes to the meals (again, at Dar Daif as well as in the desert!) - The hammam and skin exfoliation that will make you feel as reborn (a unique moment!) This is a unique & regenerating place - to be experienced the Moroccan way, without stress - where I will come back again and again!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2019,1,Too many problems,No hot water! Waiting 1 hour for staff to check the problem and they still they do not come. The air condition does not work! People sitting next to the door and smoking. I do not expect from a hotel such problems.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2019,5,Fabulous stay - we will come back if we can,"Arrived at lunch time with a group of 7, and although we had not made reservations for lunch, the staff was very helpful in preparing a light meal. We had to choose one of the gourmet dinner menus and had an absolutely fabulous dinner on the terrace right next to the kitchen. Breakfast was outstanding. All three rooms were charming and all had a different decoraion and cachet. On leaving we congratulated the owner, Jean-Pierre, with the friendliness of his staff. Moroccans are very friendly, and these people really went out of their way to do better still. We higly recommend this hotel and will do all we can to go back in the not too distant future.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2019,5,Best Hospitality Yet in Morocco,"My family of five is on a road trip, so far we've visited Oualidia, Essouira, Agadir and now Ouarzazate. We spent one night here and wish it could have lasted longer. JP and his staff are exceedingly kind and helpful. The property itself is stunning and they clearly have systems in place to ensure the happiness of all guests. I had a massage which was quite good. We were able to stay all together in one room (3 adults, 2 kids) and I hated to leave. Parting was sweet sorrow - literally made sweet with a goodbye gift and wonderful surprise car wash. Don't hesitate to stay with Jean Pierre and his staff, they are all five stars.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate

 June 2019,5,Magical place,On the way to Merzouga from Marrakech we stopped in Ouarzazate and stayed in Dar Daif. It was magical place with lush gardens and terraces. Staff was beyond wonderful and always happy to help. Rooms were dreamy and so pleasant to stay with so many wonderful details to mention. We had triple room with terrace that even had a tea nook. On the way back from Merzouga we made sure we returned back and especially on insistence of our son who found it to be like a tale story. We warmly and highly recommend this beautiful place.

 May 2019,5,Wonderful stay,This is my fourth time staying in Dar Daif and I KEEP coming back because it is a real jewel. The house is a restored kasbah and full of treasures. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with both air conditioning and heating which is great for the hot summers and cold winters. The food is all locally sourced and freshly prepared and delicious. I highly recommend the lamb and quince tagine. The most important thing for me is the deep knowledge of the area of the hosts Jean-Pierre and Zineb. They are the absolute experts on this region and if you possible can you should book a trek with them. It will be a great experience - I had a marvellous time.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate

Akşam yemeğini kendimize aşt balkonumuzda yedik. yemekler çok lezzetli ve ambians muhteşem.. bayanlar için masaj imkanı var .. 45 dakikalık bir seans ücreti 17 Euro.. kahvaltıyı yeşillikler arasında bir bahçede yaptık. Çöl gezisi planlıyorsanız ve fasa ulaştığınız ilk nokta marrakech ise , quverzazad konaklama için ideal. Ev sahiplerinin nezaketinden çok etkilendik.

Rooms very clean and you feel like going back in history during the feudal time. Super friendly staff overall.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2019,5,We only ate here--but clearly among the best traditional restaurants south of the Atlas!,"We were brought here by a Moroccan friend who had heard about the place though we were staying elsewhere. The fixed course menu was a real feast of locally sourced and carefully prepared starters--delicious marinated olives, pumpkin unlike any you have ever eaten, aubergine lightly seasoned, peppers in oil, courgettes in herbs, with savoury briouats: then a pastilla of the lightest pastry with perfect texture to the lightly spiced chicken filling. The orange tart for desert too was perfect. You will need to book in advance. It's not the easiest place to find unless you get a local to bring you, but well worth the visit. While we didnt visit any of the rooms, it also looks to be a romantic place to stay: away from it all with lots of exotic places to hang out and a really…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2019,4,Amazing place,"I stayed with my friends one night. The hotel is so so so beautiful. The room, the garden, the hamam, the food(dinner, breakfast) and of course the lovely stuff was amazing. They were well prepared, at least for the things we wanted.

The 2nd time was over Christmas 2018 with the entire family (7 of us). Dar Daifa was the starting point for a trip hiking in the desert, organized by the owners of Dar Daifa (Jean-Pierre and Zeeneb). When you walk into this Riad, you are entranced by the Moroccan decor that makes you feel that you have stepped into a story from 1001 Nights. From the mint tea that is served on your arrival (and we arrived at 1am in the morning on Dec 26), to the beautiful interior courts and gardens and maze of winding staircases where once can easily get lost, Dar Daifa is an enchanting Riad Hotel that makes you feel you are in another world.

 December 2018,5,Three nights stay,"My second time coming to this beautiful place, not just for the authentic Moroccan decor, the well coordinated Colors and the comfort but also for the high quality genuine service. All stuff at Dar Daïf made sure weren’t missing anything and provided a personalized service; from the time we want to be served breakfast till the choice of what we want to eat for dinner. The owner made sure to provide us with route maps for the area and told us about the most interesting places to visit (no need to do a lot of research before hand..take it from a local).

 October 2018,3,Not our cup of tea,"Very small dark room. Cold small shower. The swimmingpool is very very small, in the shade. No real option to spend some time. The dinner and breakfast were good.

 August 2018,5,Secret Garden,"Set outside of town, this place is an oasis. Literally. Elegant, peaceful, excellent service. Beautifully appointed, classic decor. Well maintained with every detail looked after. We enjoyed a delicious dinner and even made time for a couple of hammam treatments. After a few days driving and coming from Merzouga we needed it. Wonderful treatments. Of course you need to talk to the owner who will give you fantastic help and guidance for your trip. Listen closely as he is 100% accurate and might give you a hand drawn map. He is a wealth of information. Take a moment to chat with him. Loved this place. Highly recommend.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2018,5,"Perfect stay, wonderful staff","Absolutely loved our stay at Dar Daif. We were constantly blown away by the level of service and hospitability here.

 August 2018,5,My very first Kazbah,"OK, so maybe it wasn't the first kazbah I've ever seen, but definitelly it was the first kazbah where I stayed for the night. Dar Daif is a really nice hotel ca. 10 mins drive from Ouarzazate center. It looks like na old castle, but offers fairly modern and clean rooms. One may say that it is another kazbah-like hotels in Morocco, but this one is really special as it's staff and the owner make sure that you will feel there like at home. Small gestures such as free tea and water as well as tips given prior to your departure will keep Dar Daif in my memory as one of the best places to stay in the country.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2018,5,Amazing,"Amazing place to stay, we loved everything, our room, the food, the location, the view, the garden, the hospitality of the staff and of the owner.

Our only regret about this place was to not have stayed longer!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2018,5,Hospitality,"The most welcoming staff in a gorgeous setting. They brought us breakfast at the room at 3 in the morning, because we were fasting. The room was very cosy, the shower was good and food and warmth of the employees made us happy.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2018,5,Great experience,"The experience at this hotel was amazing. The hotel is beautiful and the employees are all very nice. Everyday we are asked at which time and where we want breakfast or dinner. There are several places to choose from common rooms, to the garden, to private balconies. On our first morning, when we were going out for the first time, we found our car clean! The nice man who helps people park, watches over the cars and carries the luggage, actually took the time to clean our car which was completely dirty after the 7 hour drive across Morocco. The owner, is a very nice person with a presence and voice which is able to lower the stress levels on anyone. I recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Ouarzazate. it may be outside the city limits but its worth it.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2018,5,Stay here . . . .,".... at least one night! I had the good fortune to be booked here for a night by a Marrakech travel agent in 2011, and the experience was so lovely that the hotel immediately came to mind when I found myself unexpectedly in Ouerzazate for a night. I was so pleased to find a room available, though I came to late too avail myself of the hammam or masseuse services, as I had on my initial visit. The rooms of the kasbah are indeed unique and a blend of traditional atmosphere and modern convenience. Small things like numerous and conveniently placed outlets, desks and tables, phone to call the front desk, well-placed mirrors, make life easier for a weary traveler. The rooms are not ostentatious but quietly welcoming and simply but aesthetically decorated. Each time I've stayed my…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2018,5,Great Teamwork Makes Everything Seem Right,"Dar Daif is a peaceful, comfortable and, if you wish, romantic place to relax for a few days or to use as a base for exploring the area around Ouarzazate. It is also very well managed, and the owner and staff appear to work seamlessly together to ensure that everything is done to make your stay successful. Our room was not meant to be luxurious but rather to follow a traditional style with all the necessary comforts. The bathroom is always important to me, and there was a great shower with plenty of hot water and even a towel warmer. In our adjoining room there was a mirror with chair and plug nearby for doing my hair. Contrary to our original intentions, we took all of our dinners at Dar Daif because the food was superb. If you choose to eat in the dining room, the tables…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2018,4,Off the beaten track and not that easy to find,"We chose this riad guided by the photos in booking.com and were a bit disappointed when we got there. We were expecting a nicer and more luxurious place, especially given the price. We have stayed in nicer and cheaper hotels during our trip, hence the comment. The riad is outside ouarzazate and it is not that easy to find. The staff was helpful and gave us directions to find the place. The room was ok. We were served tea and biscuits on arrival which was a nice gesture. We did not dine at the hotel as choice was limited and in our view expensive so we decided to take the 10min drive and dine at Habous following recommendation from staff. Breakfast was delicious. I think that there better value for money and more centrally located propositions.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2018,5,Wonderful place!,A wonderful place with ver friendly staff and great food. Every room is different and the whole place breathes a unique atmosphere. We can truly recommend Dar Daif! From there you can make great excursions in the environment.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2018,5,Service beyond compare,"Starting with the utterly charming and efficient desk clerk, the service here has been beyond exceptional. 30 minutes after check in an equally charming woman brought us tea and cookies, followed an hour later by another lovely woman bringing bread, olives and dates. The room was actually a four room suite with three separate bathroom spaces, each with its own sink. The suite was spotless, the bed comfortable and the temperature just right. Breakfast was fine. But it will be the service ( and excellent English of the staff) that will remain with us.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2018,5,Lovely Oasis,"Dar Daif was a beautiful oasis in an oasis that was a perfect place for comfort and value. Beautifully maintained, helpful staff, lovely food. Pierre was an excellent host, the staff were helpful and very accommodating.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2018,5,Fantastic hotel with Hammam,"We stayed here 1 night early in February. The service was really excellent and the staff helpful and welcoming. The space is very beautiful. My wheelchair using friend was impressed with the amenities here; ramps, accessible bathroom, and best of all, an accessible hammamm. We both had the hammamm treatment and it was surprisingly fantastic, being our first time trying it. We were so glad to have the hammamm here rather than searching for an accessible hammamm in Marrakech. The hammamm ladies were great! Our meals were served in our room as it was rather chilly on the patio. The food was very good. Service was excellent. Confortable beds and pretty decor. Also, the use of a ""Joelette"" chair was organized from the hotel for a tour of nearby Ait ben Haddou. My friend was…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2018,5,"Very friendly and service minded staff, very nice accommodation","By friends we were recommended to stay over at this hotel. It was a very nice experience. Very friendly staff, food was excellent and the service and atmosphere were very good. High quality room, consisting of bedroom, daily room, bathroom and toilet room.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2017,4,Overall good,We really liked the service at this hotel. However end of december it was a bit cold. THey have heating but it is nog nice you cannot sit outside. It was nice and warm outside the kasbah but because of the way it was build there was no sun on the terrasses. So I would recommend this place for the warmer months.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2017,5,Very charming and authentic Kasbah,"We booked the suite in Kasbah Dar Daif for 3 days to explore the area around Ouarzazate. The hotel, the suite and the staff were all wonderful. The inner courtyard is beautifully maintained with lots of plants to create lots of shade. The courtyard also has a small pool. The suite is very spacious and nicely decorated. It has 2 large rooms (both with A/C), a large bathroom and a small guest room. Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful, also when we changed our arrival date at the last moment. The hotel has a good and tasty menu with a nice selection of local food. The price of the meals is very reasonable. We normally choose to eat in local restaurants and not in the hotel. Based on the quality of our dinner on the first night we decided to have our dinners for the 2nd and…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2018,5,Incredible,"The hotel is awsome! For a cheap price, they offer you a nice room, a pool and a very beautiful structure. The staff also is very gentle and helpful. Unfortunately, I spent just one night in the hotel.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2018,5,Paradise!!,"One of the best hotel I have ever stayed! Staffs are friendly, kind and always smiling. The room was clean and well designed, we had wonderfull traditional moroccon night. I recommend this heaven without any doubt all the visitors, thank you dar daif!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2017,5,Lovely Kasbah,"Kasbah Dar Daif is ten minutes outside of Ouarzazate. I wish we had stayed more than one night. Lovely garden setting with multiple verandas, hidden balconies and terraces with views of the surrounding countryside, some of the rooms have private balconies. There is a small (not heated) pool. Inside there are several charming seating areas. Feels very much like a home. Because of the layout, you don't realize how large it is, or how many people are staying at the kasbah. One of the best breakfasts we had in Morocco. We also had dinner, which was excellent. They allowed us to keep our wine in the refrigerated storage area in the kitchen. The kasbah is well maintained with an old world charm. We were a group of 10, and all gave Dar Daif a thumbs up. Some of the staff…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2017,5,Wow!,"It's the most wonderful place! The room was super, as was the view. The staff was very welcoming and helpful, the owner Jean-Pierre gave us tons of great tipps, thanks again so much! Last but not least: the food is absolutely delicious. We will be back for sure!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2017,5,Favorite place we stayed !,This multi-level kasbah is tucked away on its own and was a welcome retreat away from the busy medinas of Marrakech and Fez. Cozy and charming. We had 2 rooms for our family of 5. The vegetarian food was delicious ! The host/owner was so kind as were all of the staff. There is a peekaboo window into the kitchen where you can see the friendly ladies preparing meals. The green ceramic tiles and pottery come from a nearby town of Tamegroute. On entering the main house you exchange your shoes for traditionally embroidered “house” shoes. The ambience takes you back to another time. I️f we had extra time we would have stayed longer.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2017,5,Amazing,"We just arrived at ouazarzate after a Long travel by car and what we were look in for was only a Clean bed and Hot shower. .But what we found was just amazing. As you enter. .. You feel as in a fairytale. . If you have the car I surely recommend this place. Super Clean, very Kind personell.. veeery good breakfast and dinner.good Job!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 November 2017,5,"Beautiful Riad, Especially After a Desert Trip","We stayed here the night before and the night after a three day desert tour and it was ideal for this. It is beautiful and luxurious (in what felt like a very traditionally Moroccan way), which was quite welcome after the long hours in the car and sleeping in tents in the desert. The food was quite good and you really felt like you were in a palace of sorts. However, it was super affordable given the level of luxury.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 November 2017,1,Dar Daif Bed Bugs,"A friend and I stayed at Dar Daif in Ouarzazate , MOrocco on the night of Tuesday 21 November 2017. We were both very badly bitten through the night by bedbugs, please see attached photo. I was bitten on my face, hands, arm, torso and leg and my friend on his arm, hand, neck and torso. I reported this the next morning to the employees at the front desk as the owner was out of town. This occurrence most definitely put a damper on the remainder of our time in Morocco, the bites and associated acute itching and great discomfort were very disagreeable, uncomfortable and wholly unacceptable. After returning home a few days later reported this to the owner via email and unfortunately he has not bothered to reply.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2017,5,Charming,"Thank you so much to the owner Mr.Jean & his team for being a good host for me & my friends . We self drive using waze to arrive here , advice to go before sunset 🌅, there's ample parking along the street . We were serve with tea & biscuits while filling up the form and waiting to be check in to our rooms . The place was relaxing . Our room was spacious and comfortable, 2 of my friends went for the Hamman and massage 💆🏻 and we have dinner here , I saw Mr Jean the owner busy preparing the food in the kitchen , he's a hard working man so was his team . The food was delicious especially the Tagine chicken and breakfast was good 👍🏻.Overall was an enjoyable stay here !",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2017,5,Very special Riad / Kasbah,"Very special for it's unique rooms - the best we had in all Morocco . The food is outstanding, the staff is great. The location is out of city center - need a car for arrival. Owner is a french guy with a good willing and very nice touch for esthetics",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2017,5,A Paradise,"After a very long day on the road I arrived at the Medieval door of Dar Daif and was shocked when I entered the riad. The street was dusty, noisy and busy but once inside there was another world, a reception area and desk with a kind lady(Sarah) who welcomed me. I was quickly registered and taken into the centre of the Riad with a pool, fountain, beautiful landscaping and birds singing for mint tea. There was no hint of the outside hustle and bustle, just peace and quiet. The room was very traditional, clean and well maintained. It's evident the owner and staff take personal pride in the care of their visitors. Dinner was a lovely mix of couscous and tagine. There are multiple private patios throughout the riad at different levels for sitting, dining or just relaxing to look…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2017,5,Whimsical,Got here after a long day of touring film sets. Been welcomed by wonderful friendly staff who could not do more for us! Got lovely tea and biscuits at the arrival. The hotel is wonderfully decorated and gives you a total moroccan experience! Very romantic! LOVED IT!,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2017,5,Excellent,"We stayed at Dar Daif twice and always had a very good experience. The house is located a bit outside the town but we always managed without a car (a public bus is available now connecting to city center). In front of the house there is a green agriculture area with date palms. The setting is peculiar and authentic since it keeps some features of a traditional local house: It is irregular and labyrintic with stairs, rooms and terraces on different levels. Rooms are well equipped, unique and welcoming; spaces vary in dimensions and luminosity, but are all very warm and cozy in our opinion,. Manutenction is good and everything is kept clean and in good order. There is an inner terrace-patio with a small pool and tables for having dinner with good weather. This place is full of…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2017,1,Worst Place to Stay,"I made the reservation based on the reviews made by the other guests, so me and my wife we have decided to visit it since we are celebrating our Honeymoon. However i was shocked as once i arrived they did not allow me to check in because i was not carrying my marriage certificate with me. The lady and the guy who said that he is he supervisor he was completely rude and literally kicked us out of the property, after a long drive of 8 hours we were tired and we needed to shower and have some rest. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Regards, Oumahjoub.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2017,5,Paradise,"My fiancé and I traveled to Ouarzazate in July and stayed at Kasbah Dar Daif. In my 33 years of traveling, this was possibly the best place at which I’ve ever stayed. We had an enormous, clean, and beautifully decorated room. The room had a romantic, in-set bedroom, an additional bedroom, a well-designed bathroom (with shampoo, soap, and lotion provided), and a private terrace with a lovely view. The staff were extremely kind and friendly and the service was outstanding. The owner even took the time to speak with us. On the first day we decided to take our dinner at the hotel. The food was superb! We ended up eating all of our meals for the rest of the trip at the hotel. Not only did we enjoy the fantastic food but also the location of our meals. We took all our meals on a…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2017,5,Gracious hospitality,"Dar Daif is a bed and breakfast style lodge on the outskirts of Ouarzazate. It is a bit tricky to find, but once you're there it will be like you've found a hidden oasis. The property itself is beautifully constructed and furnished, and the courtyard is an absolutely beautiful and restful spot to take a meal. I was so impressed by how friendly and helpful the staff are. We had a problem with our air conditioner, and it was taken care of right away. Any question we had, there was a staff member who would listen to and help us. The owner, Jean Pierre, was quite gracious and friendly as well. He took time to sit down and talk to us, and arranged a driver to take us into Ouarzazate one day to see the kasbah and tour one of the movie studios. My friend and I stayed in a room on…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2016,5,One of the best stay of my life,"I stayed only one night (unfortunately) with my girlfriend last summer and we literally loved the place and the people. The hosts welcomed us in their wonderful riad and they prepared dinner even if it was too late. The room was nice and clean, the bathroom was a bit small but definitely something you get used to in morocco. Getting there by car was a bit hard (even with google maps), but nothing impossible with daylight (I wouldn't advice getting there by night). Great place, great food, great people. Definitely recommended!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2017,5,a hidden gem in the regio of Ouazazate,"We only stayed for 1 night on our way from Merzouga to Marrakech, but it was a perfect stop. When we arrived we got an upgrade of the room for the same price. Very friendly staff, beautiful courtyard, we had a nice dinner and breakfast, a good sleep and our car was even washed by the guard. I would definitely recommend this place!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2017,5,Treated Like A King & Queen,"Outstanding service from beginning to end. All the staffs were friendly and went out of their way to ensure us having a good time. Dinner was served in our own private balcony overlooking the city which made it one the most memorable dinners I've had. They served free snacks in our room such as dates, peanuts, and tea.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2017,3,"Gorgeous looks, OK place to stay","We were only coming in for 1 night as a stopover from the Sahara to Marrakech, and you actually have to make a small detour to get to the Dar. There's no official place to park your car, but if you park it on the curb of the Dar, someone will look over it. Once inside you'll be amazed by the setup; flowers, pretty balconies, fountains, refreshing pool and different flights of stairs taking you up to all corners of the Dar and some will treat you to amazing views. Overall our room was clean (except for a spider, but hey, TIA (This Is Africa)), luggage was brought up, bed was a bit small (especially for two tall Dutchies), wifi only works in the garden, I had a cold shower (but my bf's was medium warm), you have to take your shoes of halfway through the building (to preserve the…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2017,5,Lovely authentic riad .,"Large,old and genuine riad. Staff were exceptional and the food even better They took such good care of us. We had a lovely room with views. My only regret is that we only stayed there for one night. WiFi was spotty but we were lead to believe it was due to satellite issues. Wouldn't have mattered normally but my daughter had a Skype job interview booked while we were there and desperately needed to connect.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2017,5,Secret Treasure on the oute edge of Ouarzazate,"Once you made you way to Dar Daif and enter the door you leave all the dust behind you. A nice garden with well, pool, small tables to rest and singing birds. The rooms are small but charming. We had dinner just on the veranda in front of our room. Dinner was excellent as well as the breakfast. Friendly people made our stay very pleasant.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2017,4,Very beautiful hotel but can improve,"The view from the hotel balcony was very relaxing. The Beautiful Kasbahs also offered dinner and spa. The staff gave us a wrong room. Normally I don't mind to pack the bags again and move to a new room, but after 6 hours driving, I was exhausted and already changed clothes. It was a very unpleasant discussion at the reception. In the end they decided to let us stay in the room with a price increase. We just want to enjoy the holiday and let it go. Breakfast was served every morning in huge quantities, but in my view lack of personality and quality. It was also quite annoying to have so many flies around during breakfast. Toilet needs to be flushed at least 3 times if you are lucky. There was a weird smell in the bathroom as there is no ventilation system in the shower.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2016,5,My alltime favorite place to visit and stay !!!,"AMAZING PEOPLE , AMAZING FOOD , AMAZING LOCATION ........ AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING . If possible we will stay there every year !!!!!!! The French owner is an absolute expert of the region , the culture .... and there is a extensive library on site . You just have to ask anything and they will provide . Great little swimming pool ...... Like I stated AMAZING ;-)",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2017,5,Pleasure Palace,Like everywhere we travelled in Morocco the people working at Dar Daif were generous and welcoming and very attentive to our requests. You can usually tell how well a property is managed but how happy the staff are working there. We stay here for three nights and used it as a base to explore the many sights all within an hour of the kasbah. Particularly enjoyed the dinners in the evening in the plush carpeted alcoves that form the extended dining room. We were also entertained every night by several Berber musicians. Appreciated some tips for local sights from the owner for our trip to Zagora.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2017,5,Amazing place,"You feel at home, that is the best way to say it. Extremely nice and friendly staff, beautiful rooms.....They also have excursions in the area, it is a bit expensive if you are alone, but cheaper if you travel with other people.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2017,5,Unique experience : the place to be in Ouarzazate,A great Ryad in Ouarzazate and probably one of the best in whole Morocco without exageration. This place has such a special athmosphere ! The Moroccan food served is at an exceptionnal standard even from a Moroccan point of view. The view on the oued (river) is stunning. The Ryad is a bit far from city center (3km) and on a area which does not let you expect to have such high standards so don't be surprised when you first arrive (especially at night) what you're going to find inside is a jewel !,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2017,5,A magical relaxing experience!,"From the moment you step through the arched door, you are treated like a guest, rather than a customer - from the welcome of mint tea and moroccan cookies in the room, to the slippers provided to walk around the residence, it seems that everything at Kasbah Dar Diaf is done with a mind toward the comfort of the guest. The Kasbah is very much in keeping with the Berber tradition of the area, but with all the mod cons - wifi, air con, power shower. It's taken 25 years to restore the original building and the owners (Jean Pierre and Zinab) have done this with love, care and elegance. We explored this beautiful Dar, loving the artwork, and artisanship - carpets, metal-work, tiling - and it evidenced just how much care and thought had gone into the restoration. This mindfulness…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2017,5,The best place we stayed in Morocco,"Oh man, how do I begin to describe dar daif? Oasis, meditative, quiet, romantic, relaxing, luxurious...Dar Daif was definitely the best place in which we stayed during our trip to Morocco. At around 60 euro a night we got our own private room on a roof top overlooking Ouarzazate and was able to stargaze while laying in a comfortable recliner into the desert sky. There are many features which stand out about Dar Daif: the slippers they give you to walk around, the endless mint tea and cookies, the fresh goats milk yogurt in the mornings, their kind attentive staff (everything is ""as it pleases you"" or ""your pleasure""), and beautiful setting to name a few. The only drawback which I will pass on because we got in a pickle about it, is they are about 10 minutes drive out of the city…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2016,5,Exceptional experience,"The place is incredible. From the rooms, to the patio to the rooftop area, staying at Dar Daif was an unforgettable experience. Most of all though, the service, and especially the owner are as friendly and kind as they get. If I were to go back to Morocco I wouldn't miss going to Dar Daif for anything.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2017,5,Such a lovely place to stay,Beautiful traditional Moroccan decor throughout the building. Lots of lovely terraces to sit and read a book. Very peaceful and situated just out of the town in the countryside. The staff were very hospitable. I would definitely stay there again.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2016,5,Great and beautiful place to stay,"Friendly staff, an oasis of peace, beautiful riad, very nice bedding, excellent views and quiet place. Last but not least : une bonne cuisine. In short: do not pass by OUrzazate without going to this Riad.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2017,5,Beautiful Kasbah with friendly staff and great breakfast!,"Beautiful rooms, great service and the best breakfast we had during our 12 days in Morocco. The rooms are absolutely perfekt - soap and towels, hair dryer and a welcome snack are provided. Absolutely recommended!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2017,4,"Nicely decorated kasbah, with view of city and mountains from the terrace","The kasbah has a nice view from the terrace towards the city and the mountains. It has fine architecture and detailed decor, and one can get lost through all the hallways and stairs of the kasbah, trying to find the way from the room towards the dining area. Unfortunately, we were disappointed by the food served for dinner, especially after reading the positive reviews on trip advisor. The main course was reheated, we could taste it on the potatoes from the vegetable tajine. And the meat kefta lacked taste when compared to all the other tajine we have tasted over the past two weeks in Morocco. It was very surprising, and we thought the 22 euro per person was expensive. Maybe it was not the right season or not the right cook that night. The breakfast the next day and the lunch…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2016,5,Wonderful find,"Not only did we stay here 4 nights with wonderful service, great food - they organized a 3 day trip for us up the Draa Valley with a chauffeur and a guide. Lots of walking and some visits along the way. One of us continues on to the dessert for a week organized by them. Very highly recommended.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2016,5,Environmentally friendly approach,The personnel is eager to make your stay as pleasant as ever. The Kasbah is beautifully set in the middle of nature - the view from the terrace in the morning is spectacular. The Kasbah in itself is wonderful. We had dinner and breakfast (excellent and abundant). It's the top choice for a couple of extra-relaxing days. Our room had all the comforts. A plus to all this is the environmentally friendly approach that the owners decided to adopt in managing the Kashbah. Highly recommended.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2016,5,Absolutely amazing!!,"This was by far the BEST place we have stayed during a 10 days trip around Marrakech. The whole building is a live museum, exquisitely decorated. Food is fantastic and can be served on the terrace with views on the whole valley. The stuff is very attentive and kind and the owner, Jean-Pierre, a very patient and thoughtful man who gave fantastic information and maps on the area - the trip was extremely unique thanks to him. Completely recommended!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 November 2016,5,quiet and amazing,"Was there for one night. Very friendly and helpful staff. Great location and architecture. Big and comfortable rooms. They also serve very good food. I didn't go to the Hamam, but my friend did and he said it was small, but good, traditional. Don't trust the GPS or you will end up in very narrow streets. There is a nice way to get there. I can higly recommend this place.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2016,5,Moroccan Magic,"Two relaxing nights here to break our journey from Marrakech to the desert. Well out of town, with a rural outlook and distant views to the lake. Beautiful courtyard garden, with turtle doves to serenade us. Self-contained, traditionally stylish, peaceful and intimate. We ate delicious meals on a balcony, and were made to feel thoroughly welcome by the owner and his friendly and helpful staff. Merci.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2016,5,"It is an interesting place to visit in terms of location good services,treat the client in best manner,a dream to live.","i was there and i feel as iam inside my family,nice place to stay in with a family or a friend. meals are so good,prices are normal...that place is not far from the kasbah of Taourirt,an ancien building that was built in the 17th century,studios of the cinemas is not far from the hotel,you can also discover the culture of the original people of Morocco.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2016,5,Most authentic experience,"We had the chance to spend a night in Dar Daif. We had same last minute plans and managed to arrive one day before the day of reservation. We were 3 friends : Me (Moroccan), Vietnamese, and a Russian. It was by far the most authentic stay in a Riad or Dar during our 10 days trip. We also had free access to Hamam and a perfectly Moroccan breakfast. Before our departure, the owner gave us a map with special places to visit in our road to Merzouga. Last but not least, they washed our car. It was a pleasant surprise after a muddy road from Marrakech. Thank you",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2016,5,Perfect in every way,"The standard of service here exceeds 5 star easily, from a never ending supply of complimentary tea, coffee, biscuits, nuts and bottled water to the attentive and friendly staff even cleaning our car each morning! The building is a traditional Kasbah design with all the modern facilities you could want and a few old ones, make sure you use the hammam! The rooms are tastefully decorated, comfortable and have air-con and wifi. This was more like staying in someone's home as a special guest than staying in a hotel.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2016,5,Perfect morocco,"A fantastically peaceful stay, with great food, lovely staff. I want to stay forever. I cannot find a single fault. It is a perfect place to use as a base to explore the desert and nearby oases. There is a small swimming pool, no alcohol, beautiful terraces and a shady courtyard with fountain. A really good night's sleep.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2016,5,Paradise,"Beautiful hotel, like a fairytale. Friendly staff and good breakfast on the sunny terrace. Has its own kitchen with good food. The junior suites are large but very cozy. At our departure, the owner sat down with us to advise us on our further trip, which made our trip towards Zagora much more enjoyable. We would absolutely recommend to spend one or more nights here!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2016,5,Relax stay,My friend and I spend two nights at Dar Daif and liked it very much! The owner knows his way around in Morocco and can informe you about different trips you can do on your own! Breakfast and dinner is good value! Highly recommanded!,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2016,5,wonderful experience,"one of the best experience during my Morrocco trip. Everything is just perfect. almost all staffs are very kind and professional, the strutture is a real oasis. excellent food, and what is more, the owner had organised a very special dessert trekking for me.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2016,5,"Beautiful, comfortable and above all gracious","Everything that is good about the enclosed beauty of the Moroccan inner courtyard, with flowers, fountain, tables and candles at dinner. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff delightful. Above all, the gracious attention of the owner, with his tips on roads to take and places to stop (including how to avoid Agadir, where to buy bananas en route and where to go for lunch by the sea) added a generous element of genuine care to the experience. In terms of money, also the best value place we stayed at.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2016,5,wonderful place,"I was in dar daif with some friends. We spent one night, it was for us beyond our imagination. We didn't want to leave. The architecture, the location, the colors, the stuff, and the very friendly owner. Everything seemed to be perfect. I would love to go there again",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2016,5,Our best stay in Morocco,"Most amazing helpful staff! Especially the help of the owner in advising us the spots to visit were the best. Good clean rooms, and a nice pool. The breakfast was typical Moroccan, and delicious. They even washed our car for free! If you are going to visit Ouarzazate, you should definitely stay at Dar Daif.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2016,5,"Our best stay in Morocco - amazing host, interior design, food & view","The Kasbah is a highlight of our Moroccan trip. It is beautifully decorated in traditional way and has an ecological certificate. Rooms are spacious accommodating 4, with beautiful view, separated wc and bathroom. The hotel has a refreshing pool and roof terraces with amazing views of desert with lake and mountains. The owner and stuff are so nice and helpful. The owner gave us useful informations with maps about surrounding trips and what do. The food was beautiful. Already upon arrival they served us fresh mint tee with home baked cookies. Planning a dinner here's a must. Everything you get is prepared in their kitchen. Breakfast is served on terraces and it is nice fresh air in the morning. Next time we would plan the whole week staying here! Bivanje v Kasbahu je bilo eno…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2016,5,Great authentique place,"The owner is a researcher of maroccan culture and it shows in the Dar Daif. It is tasetefully designed and very complexed, with small terraces and secluded places. As we arrived we were served welcome minth tea and amazing cookies by very friendly staff. Dinner is delicious and you have a wide variety to choose from. The owner can advise you on whole of Morocco. Places to visit, restaurants...",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2016,5,WOW!,The road that leads to this gorgeous Riad reveals nothing of the beauty that will be revealed to you as soon as you are inside Dar Daif. The building is large and complicated. It is indeed like a maze with rooms and balconies at each corner. It was one of the most beautiful Riads we stayed in Morocco and we truly wished we had more time to explore the building. Staff is incredibly friendly and our host (who lives in the Riad) is a true gentleman. A lovely breakfast which is included in the room price is served at any location you want in the garden.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2016,4,A castle outside the city center,"This Kasbah/hotel is not located in the city center so I would only recommend if you don't mind driving a few kilometers out of your way to reach it. They have secure parking. Upon arrival, they served tea and immediately began giving some advice and maps about the area and our next destination. Highly recommended if you need assistance in planning a road trip or excursions. I also appreciated the recommendations in town such as the inexpensive shop Rabat In the town; there is not much in the city center for tourists. Jean-Pierre and his staff are all very accommodating. The Kasbah itself is beautiful. You really feel like you're in a castle. they will provide you with slippers, and lead you to multiple sizes of rooms to choose from. We upgraded to a slightly larger room that…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2016,4,A true oasis in morocco,After the hustle and bustle of casablanca and marrakech dar daif in ouarzazate was a welcome relief. It isnt a five star hotel by any means but for ouarzazate it was as good as it gets. (My ratings are based on ouarzazate hotels )The owner has 35 employees so the staff to guest ratio was excellent. I would call it more a riad than dar but I felt like I was in a moroccan home. The service was great and the food was the best I have eaten in morocco for only 23 dollars per person for a 5 course meal. The cooks were women and any body knows moroccan women are the best cooks. (Breakfast is included in the price of the room) You could either choose to eat outside your room looking at the desert and palm trees or eat inside the dining room which was full of moroccan rugs. Mohammed…,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2016,5,The best hotel I have even been,"Simply the best place I have even been to rest. I will return and I will tell everyone will pass to Uarzazate to pass at least one night in the Dar Daif. The ambient, the apartment, the people, the hammam...everything is incredible.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2016,5,Amazing stay!,"Truly a shame that we only stayed for one night. When we entered the riad we decided to stay one day of our trip near the swimming pool and in the garden of the riad. We booked the mini room, but were upgraded to a bigger room, that we would definitely recommend. Breakfast was magical in this garden and includes a small chat with the owner. Rooms were clean and the riad was full of authentic Moroccan details. When we left the owner provided us with al the travel tips for our next destination.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2016,5,really the best hotel we had in Marroco,"we didn't have a reservation, we just found it in TripAdvisor and we drove there. We arrived late but somebody is watching the house and parking from outside all the time, so we received help to park and he helped us with our luggages. We went inside, received tea and cookies. they are very polite, the room was clean and we had in our room peanuts, oranges and water. breakfast was delicios, dinner very consistent and delicios also. during the day we received orange juice,tea and cookies, and they didn't put it on our bill. even more, when we left we received instructions, maps and water for the road. I have only great words for the place, for the people in there! the house is very beautiful and traditional. so many terraces, one more beautiful than the other, and you can take…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2016,5,So Beautiful...We Never Left!,"This is a little piece of paradise! It was such a peaceful spot, we just relaxed and never left for the days we were there. It was lovely to explore the place, sit by the pool and enjoy the fabulous food and ambience. All of the folks working there were lovely ! If you need a retreat and place for R&R choose Dar Daif. It is wonderful!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2016,5,"We stayed unfortunately only two nights, if we knew before this hotel and the environment we have stayed much longer","Dar Daif is a fairylike and very clean hotel. The rooms are comfortabel and the view is great: a view on the lake and the mountains. The food is delicious and the breakfast with several kinds of bread, cheese, marmelade, eggs, coffee, tea, fresh orange juice can be used on a terrace with the great view. The hotel offers several excursions. We walked the Flint gorge and oasis. It was a beautiful and interesting walk guided by Ali. We had lunch in a typical Morrocain house. The hotel is near the town Ouarzazatet; the bus stops in front of the hotel and brings you in 15 minutes to Ouarzazate. Although we stayed only two days in Dar Daif, the owner gave us the feeling we were friends for many years. When we left we got nice Morrocain presents. For sure we will go back to hotel…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2016,5,Friendly green maze behind high red walls,"The hotel itself is very special - a restored kasbah in a village outside Ouarzazate. Solid wooden doors let you pass through the high red clay walls into a hidden paradise. The welcome tea is offered in the courtyard beside a fountain, and you look up into a maze of stairways, balconies, terraces, rooms and dining areas. The friendly helpful personnel make it special. We were amazed when a mail message enquiring whether we could find their shuttle in Ouarzazte resulted in a pickup right where our bus arrived. We enjoyed learning to make pastilla with Fana, one of the cooks, and Dar Daif had the best pastilla we ate in Morocco. We had to save half for a picnic lunch, as the multi-course meals here are delicious but very filling. A walk around the village gives you another look…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2016,5,"Beautiful Dar, full of quirky artefacts","We enjoyed our one night in Dar Daif. We were given a warm welcome . The room was comfortable. We ate our delicious food on a mezzanine floor which was really beautiful. I had a Hammam at the Dar which as a great experience. I had the best massage ever! And we were given a free pot of date conserve upon our departure. We travelled with “Naturally Morocco”. We have used this company several times and always found it to be excellent. Karen and Sue have in-depth knowledge and an obvious love of Morocco. The riads are all delightful, and itineraries are adapted to the customer’s requirements. All travel arrangements went to plan.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2015,5,"Hotel, designed and run with love.","Very fond memories of this hotel. Beautiful spacious room, a very nice welcoming on our first night, a friendly staff and a proprietor who takes a lot of time to make you feel at home... And he also had a lot of helpful tips for the rest of our trip.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2016,5,"Fantastic place, concept and people","My family (2 adults and 2 kids of 8 and 11) stayed at this Dar for (unfortunately only) one night in March 2016. The property is really great, with access to rooms from the outside, with a lot of little (and larger) terraces... very very pretty and characteristic. Everything is very well taken care of, and I valued a lot the Dar's dedication to ecosustainability (recycling, use of local produce and fair trade, use of solar panels etc.). Our room was lovely, though of a particular shape: we had an entrance area with access to the bathroom, and two beds/sleeping area. To access the main bedroom (very nice and large), we had to go through a little balcony (also very nice with a small table and chairs). Now, for us this worked out perfectly, as the parents could have some privacy…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2016,5,Excellent accommodation with fabulous views,"Excellent accommodation in stylish historical mansion with fabulous views of the surrounding Atlas mountains and lake. Very good service and devoted, helpful owner. We would definitely stay there again.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2016,5,Amazing People and property,"What a nice property. I have been there 10 years ago and I still love it so much. The kindness of the people, the authenticity of the place, the friendliness of Zineb the owner...I could write tons, including the delicate food, etc... When we arrived at 2:00 am on Sunday night, someone was waiting for us, he helped us to carry our luggage to the room and when my wife wanted to tip him, he refused and ask to drop the tip in the pot at the entrance so that they could share. Remarkable.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate

 January 2016,4,Caring hosts,"We stayed for 2 nights , arriving after a long day of travel from Erfoud . All rooms vary, as it is an old home. Some are bigger, with bigger bathrooms... Luck of the draw . I had been ill, and the freshly prepared food was wonderful . I couldn't eat much... So we were able to order one set dinner to share . Breakfast on the terrace was relaxing , and so good . So fresh . I left feeling cared for , and reenergised",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2015,5,Simply the best!,"With my family, we spent 2 nights in Dar Daif before going to the desert, and one additional night in our way back. Usually I’m quite picky as I’m travelling a lot and can easily compare different standards and define the value for money that you can expect. Here, I need to admit that it was simple awesome!!! It’s not a hotel, it’s not a house, it’s a home and the staff make all their best to make you feel that way. Fantastic place full of positive energy, nicely decorated, very comfortable rooms and excellent bath rooms. The food was so delicious that I’m planning to go back to Dar Daif just to enjoy the food . Jean Pierre - the owner – ensure he is engaging with all his host and his is always willing to give plenty of tips depending on which direction you are heading to. He…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2016,4,Awesome typical Kasbah,"Friendly service and delicious breakfast. We also enjoyed the ""gastronomic"" dinner in the evening (3 courses for 22e/pers) which was the best food we had in Morocco. The view point from the Terrasse is worth to be seen. I definitively would recommend.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 November 2015,2,"Not all that glitters is gold ,","A whole page in the *Dumont* made us to decide to stay there for 2 nights. The ""Kasbah"" is situated about 5 km from Ouarzazate, so they advise you to book dinner there. At our arrival they turned on the fountain , llike in ""mon oncle"" ,a film by Jacques Tati. The staff is friendly, the rooms are abit gloomy,.The ""Suite"" we were upgraded to,had no window.Anyway the accomodation was quite ok. What was not ok was the food served there. We are eating out a lot in Morocco and appreciate the fine quality of food served in many places. The 22€ diner was a catastrophy for us.For this price you deserve an excellent meal in this country. Their menu contains camel meat or stuffed pigeons, so we decided to have some chicken and lamb. The meat showed some at least 2 times already warmed up…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2015,5,The warmest of welcomes. Nothing was too much trouble.,"On arrival you knock on a heavy wooden door to be let in to a courtyard full of plants , flowers and water features. The rooms are unusual and quirky, but very comfortable and smell fresh and scented. The beds were a little hard for our tastes. We were given dinner and breakfast by ourselves just outside our room on a terrace.. Both were delicious. Food seemed to be locally sourced and after local recipes. The date jam made in the village was to die for. So friendly. We could not recommend this guesthouse too highly.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2015,4,Lively stay in this lovely guesthouse,"We stayed twice for one night in this hotel/guesthouse. In between we slept in the desert for a night on a fantastic road, camel and walking trip organised by the hotel (desert et montagne). Upon arrival we were welcomed by friendly staff and a beautiful courtyard with a pool. My teenagers' comment was ""it really makes a change when people are nice to teenagers"" (sadly, true!) The rooms are all different: our first one was up lots of stairs so if this is a problem make sure you say so when booking as all sorts of rooms are available. Our 3 adolescents shared a room and had two lovely rooms. Ours felt a little small but then that's because the kasbah isn't a normal hotel, and ""a room"" can consist of two or three little rooms! Our first room had its own terrace. Certainly all four…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2015,5,Very comfortable Kasbah,Clear five stars: 1.Very kindly personal 2. very good traditional food 3. amazing rooms and a pool 4. very good location in the near of the palmarias 5. very good cost-effectiveness ratio In sum a clear must when you stay in Maroc. The feeling is like a family.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2015,5,"Lovely labyrinth of rooms, terraces and lounges","And some of the best welcoming cookies with tea upon arrival. One of the few places we saw in Morocco that can accommodate people with mobility issues. There is a large room on the ground floor that is wheel chair accessible. The dar has been lovingly restored, with eye catching touches throughout. Comfortable, firm beds, wonderful hot water with good water pressure. Dinner was very good and although some people enjoy wandering musicians, one set would've been sufficient. When the musician returned again, it was disruptive to the flow of conversation.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2015,5,An extraordinary experience,"We had booked the hotel from home without having the slightest idea of what was expecting us. But wow! Like a marvel to enter this kasbah and immediately being upgraded to a small suite with an interior like our best imagination of oriental living, but equipped with the modernities one needs as a traveller. The entire inside of the building is a jigzaw of corridors with antique rugs and furniture, ceramic-tiled staircases, repos, and small private terraces, viewing the flat desert mountains and a lake that is supposedly part of the Date River. The staff was friendly and very helpful, and one servant plus the proprietor were good at English. Obviously, the food, soaps, and tea were ecological, and the whole place showed great environmental efforts. There is little to see and do,…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2015,2,Not my favorite accommodation in two weeks in Morocco,"Dar Daif was just not a pleasant experience, unlike every other place we stayed. Our driver dropped us there after a long drive from the Sahara, and despite having a reservation, I think we had to sit for about an hour for them to get their act together. Pretty much nobody spoke English with the exception of one person (marginally) who I only saw once at check in. Then, while we were cooling our heels, we were told we had to make a decision on dinner immediately, so I translated the menu from French (lucky I did since there was camel meat hidden in it) and we gave our order. Only to be told that it was too late to order anything but one item on the menu that we weren’t particularly interested in. Like why make us go through all that if there was no choice? I guess one could say…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2015,5,"More like a quaint, inviting home, than a hotel","Wow. I'd seen a lot during my travels all over Morocco, but I wasn't expecting this. The room I stayed in felt like a mini-palace, with ornate marble and decorations. I don't know if I've ever felt this ""at home"" in a hotel. There were cookies and tea waiting for me on the ""coffee table"" in the living room part of my room. After driving all day from Merzouga, it's just what I needed. Great dinner out on the terrace, while listening to a local musician, who only stopped to hear the far off call to prayer. The far-off look in his eyes when the call began will always stay with me. Here was a man who truly believes. Quite humbling. Breakfast the next morning was just as great. I loved all of the mini-tagine serving and condiment dishes. I was ready to get to Marrakesh,…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2015,4,Nice Stop Before The Desert,"We stayed for a night at Dar Daif before going on to the desert. The place is nice and very typically decorated with carpets and rugs everywhere. We had a suite which was comfortable, however, the air conditioners did not work properly. We took the hammam service, which was relaxing and very typical. Dinner and breakfast were both very good.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2015,5,Great stay,"Really nice hotel in an original Traditional building. The place is cosy and nice. Everybody was helpful and kind. We stayed for dinner there, and food was very good. A super funny Berber guitar player entertained us during the meal. We got a lot of help in planning our trips to visit beautiful places. Great place!!!!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2015,5,Perfect place,"We had dinner here. The place is wonderfull, service is perfect and the menu we had was very well cooked. We are people with high expectations and these expectations were fully fulfilled. This is in our point of view one of those jewels that make your visit to Marocco complete.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2015,3,Not the perfect stay we were expecting,"Dar Daif was beautiful and accommodated a fine stay, but previous reviews had set our expectations a bit high. Below are the pros and cons of our stay. Pros: Strong wifi (routers in rooms), a beautiful public courtyard and ""terasse"", friendly staff, delicious dinner and breakfast, 1 out of 2 rooms had a beautiful terrace, AC in the rooms, a nice swimming pool, cookies and mint tea waiting upon arrival, and the views from the hotel terraces were fantastic. Cons: Dinner is quite expensive (22 euros/person), breakfast is the same every day, lighting in indoor hallways and rooms is limited (some just went on and off sporadically), most power outlets in room were not functional, no matter how many light switch combos we tried, the staff struggled to accommodate finding us a driver…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2015,4,Incredible service from lovely staff - just check your bed,"We stayed 2 nights at Dar Daif on our way from Marrakech to the coast. It's a great base for exploring the UNESCO sites of Skoura and Ait Benhaddou. The hotel is impressive, with a delicious breakfast and really helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We were unlucky enough to stay in a room which was infested with bed bugs - it's not the hotel's fault but it wasn't a very nice experience as I am allergic to their bites. The hotel manager was very kind and helpful but I just urge future bookers to double check their mattresses before going to bed, you never know where bed bugs are going to turn up!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2015,5,5 starts!,"This was truly the best property we've stayed on our whole trip. After driving for hours from M'hamid, we were happy to arrive and discover this amazing oasis. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Once you pass check in, you will be amazed of the inner courtyard, the plants, the swimming pool, the atmosphere. Truly 5 starts facilities. The place is so clean, it smells of fabric softener even outside! The building on its own is very unique, with the terrace and the inner restaurant. Room was lovely decorated, every details well thought of. WiFi was super fast as we had our own router in the room. Complimentary tea followed by room service with some delicious cookies and fruits and nuts. Small things like that really make a difference, something I would always remember and will…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2015,5,highly recommanded,"A lovely riad in Ouarzazate in Marocco, very unobtrusive from the outside, but a real pearl on the inside, nicely decorated, with lovely food and outstanding service. This little riad, a traditional Maroccan large house turned into a hotel, is highly recommanded.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2015,5,Fairytale-like castle with excellent service,"This was our favorite place to stay during our trip to Morocco. The kasbah was beautifully decorated, and the staff was excellent. We were served breakfast on the outdoor garden patio; very romantic to look out across the city and see the snow-capped mountains in the back. The value was wonderful, especially since they upgraded us to a larger room with a sitting area which was fantastic. Next time, we'll have to try dinner there, since breakfast was incredible. Can't wait to return! Also, the owner was very helpful and friendly. He chatted with us to make sure we had a good stay, and also to make sure we had the correct directions to drive to Ait Ben Haddou. He also gifted us with homemade fig jam to bring home to NYC! How thoughtful.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2015,5,Magic moment,"This splendid 'Maison d'Hôtes', just outside the town of Ouazazarte, is a must for any discerning traveller. This old Caravansary has been beautifully restored and the rooms, terraces and courtyards are very attractively arranged. Excellent food and service, and all the staff are very welcoming. An excellent base for visiting this fascinating region.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2015,5,Quaint cosy hotel,"We stayed for only a night during our recent trip. The check in and going through different levels and rooms before getting into the room seemed confusing at first. But after settling down, I began to appreciate all the little useful details the owner has put into the hotel to make the stay very comfortable. This is also the place I had my tastiest tagines throughout the country. The owner told us he is very active in promoting mountain trekking. I would have stayed longer if I had known, if not for the excellent cuisine too.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2015,5,Excellent Stay,"I stayed for 1 night in this Riad. I was really surprised. It is an amazing place. Not in the center, but who cares. very nice rooms, excellent food. Obliged to take of you shoes and use a pair of babouches. in ths middle is a small swimming pool.Very eco minded. At arrival receive a mint tea with homemade coockies. 2 fresh oranges. When you leaves they give you a present (homemade marmalade & a bottle of water for the road. Try to book this riad at the end of your stay & you will never forget Morocco. what a pearl. Thank you so much for existing.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2015,5,No place else on the way to the dessert!,"What an amazing place to stay in Ouarzazate, yes it is not the most central place in Ouarzazate but who actually cares? This place is done with so much love and attention, you just want to adore it. The rooms are cozy, the food is good and the place feels just right and authentic. Never booked a tour with them but I think it would be right choice if you planned one. Open departure they gave us great tips on what roads to take, thanks!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2015,5,"Excellent and very personal service, I recommend it highly","We stayed there for 2 days with our kids, (15 y.o and 5 y.o) February 27 and 28. We were greeted with peppermint green tea and cookies at 1am. I was surprised to find our car clean and washed the next morning. Breakfast is very healthy and will give you a good start for the day, all organic local products. I loved the date marmalade ""Confiture"" and sirop, the all natural yogurt, the Harsha, Msamen and Baghrir ""Pancake"" and the good service provided all, the owners ""Jean Pierre and Zineb"" and all the staff. I was very impressed by the ""Green"", friendly environmental and ecological approach of the house. Dinner was excellent. The junior suite was roomy enough for all of us, clean and very cozy.

 December 2014,5,Like a queen at the desert's door,"I recently went for a 1 week walk in the maroccan desert. As my plane was arriving very late at Ourzazate, the owners of Dar Daif sent someone to pick me up at the airport. I was starving as I had to wait for about 4 hours in Casablanca airport. I did not even need to say anything, but when I arrived at Dar Daif, some tea, amazing cake, biscuits and a so tasty salad fruit was waiting for me! Then I was shown the room, which was big, very clean, and really comfy :-). The breakfast was wonderful as well, with yummy local honey and jam, and very good coffee. After the week spent in the desert, I came back to Dar Daif, and the welcome was again incredible! I had the chance to get some skin peeling in the hamman, making me feel fresh and young again! Afterwards, I was given an…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 November 2014,5,"Very welcoming, delicious moroccan food","Arriving very tired with three little kids it felt like home. The staff were very welcoming offering me a huge pot of lovely moroccan tea and delicious traditional cookies upon arrival. The rooms are spacious and can easily accommodate a family of five like ours. The only difficulty I faced was the shower which was a bit tricky to use to bathe kids. On that night we invited our friends (who stayed at a different hotel) over for dinner. The atmosphere was lovely, the food was delicious and felt like home cooking. All agreed (including the kids) that the dinner was the highlight of our visit to ouarzazate. Upon leaving the owner gave us a book of traditional children tales and a bottle of home made molasses.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2014,5,Unbelievable,"Sixteen days traveling through Morocco. And when we arrived at Dar Daif through a shadowy back roads and through some small neighborhoods. What a great place, friendly people, Succulent food, beautiful rooms and what a details. Everything was just perfect. Before we left for Marrakech we got from the owner some homemade directions with additional sites on the route. And a delicious pot dadeljam!Too bad we were there just for one night, but if we go to Morocco again, we will sure come by for some more days.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2014,4,"Quite far from the city, but worth the trip","The riad has a typical Moroccan decoration with lots of carpets. We had a good room, an upgrade in a suite. Nice patio where you can eat well. Not cheap, but worth it. A quiet location with views of palm trees and the city. The travel advice from the owner for the visit of sights along the way to our next destination, we have greatly appreciated. Negative is that the riad is in a kind of suburb from the city. The riad is marked very well the last 2 km when you enter this suburb, but not easy to find coming from the city. Check the air conditioning units before you go to sleep. The two units in our room were switched off and the next day we heard how to turn them on.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2014,5,First stay,This was an overnight stay but an excellent one. This is probably the best riad we stayed in. We had a suite with a small balcony. Our meals were serve on a lovely patio.

Staff very friendly and helpful.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2014,4,"interesting, traditionally kept guesthouse","The guesthouse in a kasbah is set a little outside of Ouarzazate. It is filled with traditional decor and small surprises at every turn. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There were very few guests and we were immediately offered an upgrade from a standard room to a suite at no extra charge. The pool was lovely and the hamam looked good, but we didn't stay long enough to try it. The three course meal was good, the portions generous, as was the breakfast. There is a musician who plays at dinner. At the end of our stay, we were also given a goodbye present of date jam from the region.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2014,5,A very welcoming place to stay!,"Staying in Dar Daif is a really pleasant experience! You feel very welcome the moment you enter the place. We were upgraded to a suite on the third floor: a very spacious room and waking up in the morning you see the sunrise from your bed above a beautiful landscap. The food is delicious and the garden is very pleasant to relax with a lot of shade and a swimmingpool to cool down. The place is situated a little bit out of town but there you will find everything you need to make your stay a very pleasant one: friendly staff, great food and pleasant rooms. The owner is very hospitable. He advised us how to drive to Marrakech via a very scenic route. And we liked it very much.

 April 2014,5,A quaint mansion in the middle of nowhere,"This is the eighth of eleven riad reviews in Morocco, following the Marrakech review, and preceding our stay in Taroudant. Stayed on 30th April, 2014. The riad is not actually in the town of Ouarzazate, but is about twelve kilometres outside, and to reach it one needs to go through a long stretch of unpaved dirt road. If you do not have the use of a car, this is not the place for you. However, most travellers to Ouarzazate are either on the way to Marrakech, Merzouga or the Todra Gorge, so it is inevitable that they have a ride. The mansion is run by Berbers. Once past the main lobby, you are asked to take off your muddy shoes. We didn’t mind. Its multiple levels of rooms, lounges, halls and corridors are cluttered with chairs and sofas, rugs, art and memorabilia that make the…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2014,1,Gem of bad taste,We stayed at Dar DAIF after reading several positive comments about the place. What a surprise when we arrived and find that we had the worst room of the place covered with dust the floor.! We almost don't fit on the shower. Nobody speak English or Spanish so it was a frustration the intent to communicate. It was really a nightmare!,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2014,5,A gem,"Initially we arrived for a one-night stay on our way from Skoura to Marrakech. We eventuallt stayed one more night and with input from Jean-Pierre (the owner) reviewing our travel itinerary for the next 10 days!! Thank you Jean-Pierre for your excellent advice! Your maps were precise! You guided us to find architectural treasures in off-the beaten track areas which did not require more effort! We experienced many more aspects of this wonderful country because of your experienced in organizing journeys of discovery. Dar Daif' staff is engaging and helpful. You surprised us on numerous occasions: washing our dusty car, offering a box of homemade cookies and water at our departure, providing hand drawn maps for our outings. Not to mention the copious meals, appeasing hammam, great…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 March 2014,5,unique experience,"we stayed one night on our way to Marrakech; we found it thru a guide after looking at some other locations. It is very intriguing: lots of ups and downs, stairs, memorabilia. The views are incredible and the rooms very cozy. The service was great and the manager (a French) was really nice and helpful in advising us where to go next off the touristic route. We will never forget this experience.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2014,5,"Fascinating, very authentic.","We stayed one night here on our way from Marrakech to Merzouga and left wishing we could have stayed longer. We arrived in the dark but found it OK although my pre printed google map showed it to be on the left and in fact it's on the right of the road. (a side road a few miles from Quarzazate, make sure you locate on a map beforehand) Fine views of the Atlas mountains from various terraces and sitting areas. Our room was clean and very comfortable. The welcome was warm and friendly with a silver tray of mint tea and cookies brought to our room. The building is old and fascinating. Lots of different levels and old pieces of furniture, rugs, carpets and pictures everywhere. This kasbah seems to be run by a local family who have combined the best of traditional Moroccan…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 January 2014,4,Great service,"A friend and I spent one night in Dar Daif in January, 2014, on our way from Merzouga to Marrakech. We both have some physical limitations, so had asked for a ground floor room, which they gave us. We arrived quite late at night and knowing that would be the case, had had our tour company order dinner. The dining area is on the second floor, so the staff set up a table in our room and served us a five-course meal in our room. Fabulous service, and we didn't have to ask for it! The same service was provided for breakfast. And we were only there one night. The room (actually a large one and a small one as one) was quite satisfactory, although a bit chilly. The service was what was so special.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 November 2013,5,Very nice,"We only spenty one night here but enjoyed it a lot. The house is very nice. Rooms are big and clean, hammam is very pleasant (and free !) and staff very helpful and gave us good tips for the continuation of our trip. Having breakfast on the terrace is also something incredible. A must in Ouarzazate",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2013,5,A gem,"We spent three nights at Dar Daif; exploring the Draa Valley area. This boutique hotel is in a somewhat surprising location, outside of Ouarzazate, but once you enter the high wooden gates, it is a world of its own. Superbly restored, in an authentic style, this riad offers memorable dinners, profound peace, and a very knowledgeable staff. The well stocked library is a bonus; as well as the gardens and roomy terraces . Jean Pierre, the owner, is extremely helpful and knows how to explore the real Morocco. Quite a treat!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2013,5,beautiful setting!,"Dar Deif is a very nice boutique hotel around 10 km away from Ouarzazate down-town. Based on the map provided by the mail it's easy to find with your own car. The setting is beautiful - located almost at the end of the road the view in front of the hotel is the vast green patch of palm trees and fields, which spread around a small rice in the south of Ouarzazate basically covering the whole view from west to east. Behind, the city, which has become quite lovely in recent years with it own majestic setting in front of the high Atlas Mountains. Due to the altitude of roughly 1200 m, the air is fresh and crisp. The staff of the hotel is very friendly and attentive. The rooms are very comfortable and nicely decorated in a typical Moroccan country house style, which fits very well…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2013,5,"Beautiful place, dinner and service","We spent only one night in Dar Daif but it was one of the most memorable, particularly the dinner. It's a compulsory 20 Euro/person meal but totally worth it. Somewhat different from the typical Moroccan dinners with a tasty twist (e.g., spiced carrot salad, date ice cream). It was a beautiful setting - definitely worth it, especially if you then plan to drive south towards M'Hamid. Also, Jean Pierre, the owner, was lovely and super helpful with informing the rest of our trip.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2013,5,Wonderful relaxing place - full of character and great views,"We booked into Dar Daif via booking.com for four nights. On arrival we were greeted with a refreshing round of mint tea and biscuits and a lovely induction from the proprietor Jean Pere. The location - outside Ouarzarzate so you would need to have a car or be prepared to get transfers from the airport. We loved the peace and quiet of the surroundings. It's right on the edge of the palmeraie so you can get a great view from the many balconies an watch the world go by. The breakfast - was the same every day and this would be my on,y point of feedback. Sme variation would have been nice. It was lovely - beghrir pancakes, m'laoui pancakes, polenta pancakes, plenty of jams, honey and juice, yoghurt, tea or coffee but some variation would have been welcome. The dinner -…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 August 2013,4,Wonderful house full of surprises with decent rooms,"This house is not your typical riad, but feels rather like a family home (you are required to take your shoes off in the main house). The common area is full of little decorative details, which provide a unique ambiance. Dinner and breakfast is served in the garden or on one of the many intimate terraces - while other guests and the hosts are present, the secluded spaces offer a very private setting. The most exceptional feature of the Dar are its surprising corners, terraces and sitting spaces, which invite you to spend time exploring them and relaxing. Our room (junior suite) was spacious and homely, while not being extravagant (e.g. very clean and cosy, but rather simply furnished). You are welcomed with fruits, dried figues and nuts in your room and the hospitality of all…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2012,5,Magical place,"The place is fantastic with ver nice and professional staff. We had dinner in a private balcony, every guest has dinner alone at a diferentt balcony, with very beutifull view, very good tradicional food and tradicional music, very good place to make a stop.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2013,5,What a treat!,"We arrived at Dar Daif almost by accident (it was mentioned in our Guide Routard), but what a great surprise... It's location may be a bit unusual, but once you pass that big gate you're in for a treat. Friendly staff, great service with attention to detail, charming rooms, truly excellent dinner, very nice atmosphere ... we couldn't find a single negative point, should have stayed longer. Because of the low season, we also received a free upgrade to a nicer room. (we hadn't even asked for it)",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2012,5,A Pearl at the doorstep of the desert,"Dar Daif is located at the outskirts of Ouarzazate. As so often in the region, the appearance from the outside reveals nothing about the beautiful place this is, so don't be afraid if you arrive late in the evening and are put back by the somewhat shabby appearance of the surroundings. The place, as I understand, used to be a Kasbah (the word has a number of similar meanings, in this case the fortified home of a local chief), and has been remodeled into a hotel. The look is very local, attempting to recreate the ambience of a caravan relay post (caravansérail), with lots of wood, carpets, a dimmed and quiet atmosphere. You will surely dive into another world for the duration of your stay, but if you prefer and expect the modern, cool design of the fashionable moroccan hotels…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2013,5,Charming Riad,"After our trip to the desert our guide took us to a riad which we didnt like at all... We searched another riad in the internet, and read about the excellent reviews on Dar Daif in tripadvisor. We went to the door, were greeted with a very warm welcome... When you enter the riad, you enter into a different world... It has a beautiful courtyard and traditionally decorated, comfortable rooms. The staff is always helpful and cheerful... We chose a beautiful room on the courtyard and we had our dinner and breakfast just in front of our room... It is so nice to hear birds singing when you are having your breakfast... I wish we could have stayed longer... I would sincerely recommend dar daif...",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2012,5,"Peace, Quiet and Great Internet","This was on of several riads I stayed at on a 10 day trip to Morocco--and I stayed here twice. The rooms are very comfortable, very clean and have great internet access. They also have really good reading lamps, which was rare. Hot water was plentiful. There is no TV--great! The food was good, I had both breakfast and dinner at the hotel--which is well away from the town so going anywhere was not easy--and made for a quiet location. The gardens are beautiful. There is no alcohol at the hotel, but you can bring your own. The only small complaint I have is the musician was a bit overbearing--all through kindness but it was too much like the mariachi band at a mexican restaurant. He did finally leave us to our conversation. John Pierre, the owner is very helpful in…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2012,5,I Wish We'd Had Longer Here!,"We booked this place on the advice of our booking agents (Naturally Morocco). From the minute we entered through the large wooden door from the street it felt like being in paradise! What a stunningly beautiful property this is. The decor is 'traditional' and absolutely amazing. We'd chosen to upgrade to a Junior Suite, and ended up with a very nice room (No.20) with plenty of space and superb views from our own private terrace. Jean Pierre, Zineb, and all the staff were extremely helpful and gracious. There were some very nice touches - like being given a large bottle of water when arriving each evening and when departing each morning. If you're a bird lover, Dar Daif is for you. On our first morning we took a stroll to the reservoir, led by a member of Dar Daif's team. The…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2012,5,Hidden Gem,"We found the Dar Daif when driving back from the desert. I started to get late and we needed to find some where to stay. As with a lot of places in morocco the outside looks ......not very inviting! Once through the doors it is like entering another world. A quiet courtyard garden and good views. The evening meal was good and we were played to by local musician who managed to get a tune out of the four stringed ""broomhandle and bowl"" not sure what they call it, but he was brilliantly enthusiastic. The staff were friendly and this is a good place to stay. It is a bit of a miander down the back street to find it but it you ask a local they all know where it is.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2012,5,Lonely kashbah,"We had à verhaal pleasant stay for ons nicht at dar daif. Warm welcome, delicious dinner. The room was Nice and clean. When we left Jean Pierre THE owner gave us some great tips for off road trip through dades vallee.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 June 2011,5,Unforgettable week,"I can never forget this place, very warm and welcoming riad, we were in summer, beautiful room with beautiful fourniture and artisanat , during the day, you can have a swim, and later a hammam. I can never forget the food: 100% bio, We did not get to be bored, no TV, eating having some rest reading, swimming...You can ask for any thing you want, you will get it with a nice smile. Very clean, the smell of the rooms and also the library with interesting books to reads. Bravo J Pierre I want to go back",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2011,5,Dar Daif and desert adventure,"Four days in the Sahara folded into a Dar Daif envelope -- a package so close to perfection the only criticism I can muster is chipped cups at the Dar and sub zero temperatures night and morning in the dunes. But we expected the latter and forgave the former because the rest fulfilled our R&R dreams like no previous holiday. We are middle aged and appreciative of creature comforts offered by an impeccably managed, elegantly presented and brilliantly located Moroccan guest house. A few kilometres from the outskirts of Ouarzazate, Dar Daif is a short stroll from the shores of Lake Ouarzazate -- a RAMSAR designated wetland, teeming with birdlife. An ornithological delight -- we sat for hours in pleasant winter sunshine gazing through our ""jumelles"" at hundreds of cormorants and …",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2011,4,Charming riad with very good food,"Once you get past the union banner across the street (only relevant if you speak Frency), this is a charming riad with a pleasant courtyard, stairs going off to several different levels. As we had 4 rooms for our party, there was a good amount of up and down during our stay getting to and from the different rooms. Some of the rooms were quite large, with sufficient room for parents and two children. Our room was off the dining room, which was a bit strange in the evening as we had to stand at the nearby table while inserting the key in the door! The food was fantastic, both dinner and breakfast. As there is an opening to the sky from the courtyard, we had a few birds watching us during breakfast; they seemed to enjoy the food as well!",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2011,3,Shabby Chic,"Starting with the good points, the food here was amazing, really, really good. The staff were also lovely and the courtyard area was beautfiul. Slight niggles were the fact that a bird was flying around our landing for the entire duration of our staying, coming into our room on a couple of occasions, I know it's Morocco and not London but I was a little freaked eating breakfast inside with a bird flapping near by. Not to mention the bird muck that was on numerous cushions etc. Only other small point was that the restaurant doesn't serve alcohol, they're happy for you to bring your own, which we didn't know about until we arrived. The interior is full of rugs, cushions and candles which I'm sure make this place very cosy in the winter, no major issues, just not really our cup…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2011,4,Nice Hotel but chose your room wisely!,"We stayed at the Dar Daif for 3 nights. We used Ouarzazate as a base for many excursions in the beautiful surrounding areas. First impressions were good (despite the unions demonstrators and banners outside), the hotel is on different levels and it has been well renovated, respecting the character of the Kasbah. The swimingpool is small but nice, the communal rooms are in traditional style and we liked the general feel of the place. The room we picked was quite cheap (EUR45) so we did not expect a lot, however it wasn't just small, terrible shower and in need of 'freshen up' but it had no external windows! I think they should clearly state that in their internet site. We would have liked to change room, but first there was no free room for the all length of the stay, and second…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2010,5,Beautiful scenery,"This was a charming place to stay in Ouarzazate. There is a peaceful courtyard in the center and the inside of this large guesthouse had a very authentic feel. We were given a nice, cozy room that was clean and had comfortable beds. We were very close to the dining room which served an excellent dinner. We were only staying one night here and unfortunately I had an upset tummy from something I had eaten hours before we arrived. The staff felt bad for me and tried to give me light foods like yogurt. Even though I was having tummy problems, I could not resist to try their dinner. It was so tasty and the lamb melted in your mouth. The food quality was very high. Breakfast was nice the next morning because we sat right by the window which offered stunning views of the…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2011,4,"Beautiful place, an oasis, with fantastic food","Make sure you look it up on the map before you go, but once the door opens you find yourself in an oasis with the beautiful internal courtyard full of shrubs flowers and trees. We ate late on the terrace and had a fantastic view across the flats of Oarzazate with the snow capped peaks of the Atlas as backdrop - breathtaking. The food was amongst the best we had in Morocco with lots of vegetable accompaniments to the main dishes which was welcome. Inside, the Riad is homely and attractive - even has a small library. Only downside was one of the rooms was a bit small with no external light - however the other one, a suite, was large and really lovely. We also noticed that some presumably disgruntled employees/union members were staging a sleep-in protest outside the Riad - we…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2010,3,Not again for me.. but read why.,"We checked into the main hotel and they took us through the beautiful main hotel. Then out the back door, down the alley way to the crappy 2nd hotel. It was bad! We had to move rooms due to bugs. They were not at all friendly here. They messed up massage and bath arrangements and didn't care. We had to carry our luggage up and down the stairs too. I might stay here again if I got to stay in the main hotel it really did look nice. The view from the rooftop patio was beautiful.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2010,5,Respect for people and earth,"Want to be in a super comfortable and supermorocco hotel? Take this one. I have so much respect for the owners. They made this place so beautiful - all the colours and softness of the tapisseries, les babouches they offer to you...Do you know they have in permanent service 51 persons? That means 51 families having a salary....Do you know your food comes right from the local market? Come here and a dream becomes true PS I was not paid for this article :)",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 December 2010,4,"Excellent service, characterful hotel.","We stayed 2 nights this December in the small bedroom, which was very good value. The location is slightly out of town down a long road, which was fine even with a small car. It was v peaceful. There was wifi, and a swimming pool which would be nice in the summer. The compulsory dinner was nice, but not the best value at 210dh each per night. Overall, the staff were very helpful and I'd recommend it for a quiet stay outside Ouazazate.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 October 2010,4,Good riad experience,Stayed at this riad for one night in October 2010. A long way out of the centre of Ouarzazate but well signposted from the N9 and not difficult to find. Parking was on the street outside the riad and we had no problems in this respect. Free wi fi available in the courtyard where there was a nice sitting out area and a small attractive pool. The old building hasbeen beautifully restored and is full of oriental carpets and bric a brac and had lots of narrow passages and terraces with views over to the lake which were lovely in the morning sunlight. Everything a nice riad should be. We liked the nice touch like the welcoming tea and cakes and the fact that although dinner is obligatory this was waived due to our late arrival. Breakfast was fairly standard and served on traditional…,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2010,5,A genuine delight,"It is good advice to ignore the very amazing and very poor hotel reviews - I hope however that you will not ignore the great reviews of Kasbah Dar Daif. We started our short tour of Morocco with two nights at Dar Daif and are so thankful that we did. We arrived quite late in the evening to a warm welcome and were able to order a meal. We ate breakfast and dinner twice at the riad and the food was always delicious. We did not encounter tajines like it anywhere else in Morocco - the food was not heavy and greasy but still tasty, delicious and tender. The Riad is decked out in local rugs and brassware. Its the sort of look people try to replicate in their homes - and never quite pull it off - well here it works and feels natural. We were there at the end of summer and it was…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 July 2009,4,Excellent service and helpful owner!,"My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights at Dar Daif and we really enjoyed the best service we had in our 2 weeks trip in Morocco: they provided us large bottles of fresh mineral water several times during the day and fresh fruit and nuts in our room, they helped us parking our car in front of the hotel and washed our car during the night, the swimming pool is clean and nice and available at all times (also in the late evening). Dinner was compulsory to us (it could be a good thing because of the distance from the town center ---- which is not particularly worth of visiting during the evening, in addition), but we found it good, and breakfast is copious and tasty. You can have your meals wherever you want: in the garden, in the inside restaurant, in the terrace, also in your room with…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 May 2009,5,what a view!,One night only but beautiful place. Had our own terrace with amazing views. Food was good. Good Hammam also.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2008,4,Good accomodation & food,Unusual riad with cool decor although some of the rooms are a little dark. Has a good pool area & a rooftop. Meals were great & staff were v accomodating. They don't have alcohol so stock up in the little supermarket in town.,Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 February 2008,5,Great Riad,"I really my stay in Dar Daïf: it was my first stay in Morocco when in I landed in Ouarzazate, and I have been enchanted with the warm welcome I got in Dar Daïf. The service is indeed very good, and you will quickly forget of the daily problems n Europe or the US when enjoying a panoramic view on the Atlas Moutains with a cup Mint Tee in your hands and other Moroccan treats. This B&B is a large restored Ksar, with a pool in the patio, but also a fantastic hammam. Meals are great and generous after a day of visit n Aït Benhadou or the Valley of the Roses. Finally, the housekeepers, a french-moroccan couple, are extremely helpful and can advise you for organizing a round trip to Merzouga and Zagora.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 September 2007,5,"One night only, but a great stay","We arrived at Dar Daif without a reservation and were greeted by the friendly staff, who showed us the 3 available rooms. The hotel is unique in that it is in a restored Kasbah, with the layout being a maze of different sized rooms, all decorated differently in the traditional berber style. Once we'd settled in, we were offered tea on the terrace, and also our choice of locations around the hotel to have dinner later in the evening. We chose a spot on a small balcony overlooking the gardens and pool -- the meal was excellent. When it came time to check out the following morning, we found that the hotel had given our hire car a wash....a very unexpected, but welcome touch (driving in the desert is very dusty!). I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this property to anyone…",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
 April 2007,5,Really enjoyed our stay,"I stayed here one night during a cycling tour, so I hadn't chosen the hotel myself but thought it was great. We stayed in the triple room on the ground floor, which appeared to have good facilities for wheelchair users. The hamman was a little more invigorating than I would have chosen myself, but it was still good, and those in the group who had the massage said that was fantastic. We also had an excellent dinner.",Dar_Daif,Ouarzazate
