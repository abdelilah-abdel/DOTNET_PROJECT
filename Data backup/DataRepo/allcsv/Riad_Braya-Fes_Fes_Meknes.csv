 December 2022,5,A comfortable stay in a historic home,"Simon greeted us warmly, attended to us professionally, and advised us regarding opportunities in the area. He arranged our transfer to the desert tour team, removing concern regarding that transition.

 September 2022,5,Amazing stay in Fes!,"I stayed at this Riad for four nights, and I had a wonderful experience. My room was lovely and everything was spotless. The pillows were so comfortable it was hard to get up in the morning! The food was delicious and the view of the Medina from the rooftop terrace was stunning. But what made this stay incredible was the staff. Mohammed and Simon could not have been more lovely, so helpful and kind. Any time I needed anything they were there to help, and they were so welcoming and hospitable. The riad itself was also beautiful and in a great location. I was genuinely sad to leave, but I will definitely be back. Would absolutely stay here again!",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes

They gave us welcome drinks and snacks. Simon was very friendly and answered all our questions about Fes and the riad, he also served us breakfast in the morning. Once we were ready he showed us the room which was amazing and was the best riad we stayed in during our stay. We had our own balcony looking down to the pool and the room was huge. The bathroom was incredible. The tv had English channels which was also appreciated. The aircon was quite noisy. We had complimentary snacks and fridge in the room which was great.

The rooms are modern, clean, and well cared for. Without a doubt, the place is beautiful, but for me the most valuable thing about that place are the people who work there. Simon is without a doubt a jewel in that place, his service went above and beyond all the time, super friendly, his service is impeccable. What would make me return to this place without a doubt is the service we received. We were in another Riad, it was a good service, but I think the one we received in Brayan was much better. Simon and his, another colleague of his whose name I don't remember, were excellent. Thank you very much…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 April 2021,3,"Good, but not 5 star","This hotel is an old colonial home. Very nice structure that has been renovated; however, it’s for sure not a 5 star hotel. I would say 3. It doesn’t have amenities a 5 star has, for example: no restaurant, gym, pool is more of a decoration than usage, etc Service team is great, they tried to do what they could, but overall, for sure not a 5 star hotel",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes

The breakfast is very good and the dinner we had two nights were very good as well. The service was simply amazing, Mohammed is one of the best hosts I ever met in my life. We wanted to have our breakfast or dinner in the room? No problem! In the terrace? No worries! By the pool?

We had a beautifully decorated room over looking the courtyard. It was clean, warm and architecturally interesting. The stand out experience was our interaction with the hosts, particularly Simon who was there to greet us and check us out.

There was exceptional service by the riad management that allowed us to feel right at home - Simon made all the arrangements for city tours, meals, taxi drivers, and even walked with us to a local shop to buy diapers for our baby so we wouldn't get lost in the Medina! The hotel itself was beautiful and clean with comfortable guest rooms. The rooftop view over the Medina was breathtaking. The breakfast was excellent, and we looked forward to it every morning.

We were welcomed very warmly by Simon from the moment that we stepped out of the car (the closest point that the car could get us to the Riad was 2-3 min walk away from the Riad). We were served a platter of Moroccan biscuits and cake, as well as mint tea, while doing the check-in. Props to Mohammed & Simon for preparing a wonderful breakfast for my parents on the balcony of the Royal Suite 3 floors above!

The staff was so helpful and kind, and smilingly made sure that we had everything we needed. Simon helped us when we checked in and when we checked out. He was so friendly, from his cheerful breakfast service to arranging for us to depart to the airport --- he really made us feel welcome and at home. The rooms were comfortable and clean, and of particular help to my mother (who has limited mobility) there was a large room on the lobby-level so that she did not have to climb multiple stories to reach her room.

Gorgeously stylish Riad also serving a ‘real’ cocktail; super quiet room despite feral amplified music nearby over Fez Medina til very late one night.

 October 2019,5,Beautiful Riad,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at Riad Braya. We were warmly welcomed by Simon. The customer service throughout our stay was 10/10 thanks to Simon and Mohammed whom we dealt with during most of our stay. We booked the Junior suite which we both loved very much. The room was spacious and very clean. The breakfast each morning was beautifully prepared outside of our room and the food was plentiful. The Riad is a few minutes walk from any parking space but there are always people on hand to assist you with your luggage (for a small tip). Hotel staff kindly arranged airport transfers and a half day Medina walking tour for us and were always on hand to assist with any other tourist information.

 May 2019,4,"Tranquil, beautiful, quiet place","The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars to the Riad Braya is because our lovely room lacks some of European expectations. But, we soon grew to absolutely love this Riad. The reason is, apart from the quiet beauty of the place, we were kindly supported, befriended and helped by Mohamed, or Simon, who also brought us our breakfasts and our orders of tea etc during the days. These 2 men made our holiday for us. They were a really delightful presence at the Riad, and we miss them! We spent 4 nights at the end of May in the Junior Suit on the ground floor which is spacious and beautiful with a very high ceiling and opens straight onto the atrium with the small, blue pool outside.

The room was not spacious but it was comfortable and quiet and cool. The Riad is just 5 minutes from the Medina so we unpacked and freshened up and headed out. Mohamed is full of information on how to enjoy Fez. He can arrange tours and suggest restaurants.

Nevertheless, the noise was kept to a minimum. The terrace on the top floor of the riad is a must see! The view is incredibly beautiful. We stayed at this riad during the winter, and it was cold as expected. However, the water takes around 1.5h-2h to get heated up, and strangely enough we couldn't get hot water in the evening/night.

It was a peaceful stay and it was lovely to visit the medina of Fes but then retreat to the peaceful bliss of Riad Braya. Breakfast was really good and prepared for a time we chose.

He also makes the breakfast tables in the morning and does other things. Simo recommended me to hire a tour guide for half a day to tour the medina which is the biggest in Morocco.

Your party (and your luggage) will be met by young men who will escort you thru the very narrow labyrinthine corridors of the Médina (cars not able to come inside). After walking about 250 paces (I counted) you will be very kindly greeted by one of 2 managers that literally run the entire riad. We were met by Simo (aka Mohammed).

Definitely talk a walk up to the terrace to get a beautiful birds eye view of the old city...and if you time it right you'll get swept away by the sounds of the Call to Prayer. I chose a standard room and it was spacious and the beds were comfortable. I had plenty of space to move around and not feel cramped.

They always take the time to make sure that we had our needs taken cared of. We enjoyed our stay in Fes because of them. The riad would have been just a nice building without them. But with Mohammed and Simon doing everything they can to ensure that we were having the best time in Fes, the riad was amazing. The moment you enter the door and get welcomed into the courtyard with Moroccan mint tea and cookies, to the terrace on the roof top with an amazing view of the medina and to the comfortable room, it was the best place we have stayed. Breakfast was really good and plenty that we really didn't feel hungry during the day wandering around the medina. The medina was only a few minutes walk and we…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,Great Riad and Service,"This Riad is beautiful, from the moment you enter you feel relaxed and the service by Simo and his staff was great!

Thank you again!",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,"Good Riad, great staff","This Riad is really beautiful and located in a great spot in the Medina, but not too deep inside which makes it perfect. There is an indoor pool, and we opted out of breakfast (preferred to go check local cafes instead). The room was great, a/c and internet were great. The safe was rather small which wasn’t that convenient, and there wasn’t sufficient lighting in the room. The best thing about this Riad is its staff, and especially Simo who was absolutely lovely, helped us with any issue, gave us tips, helped with reservations etc. Shukran Simo!",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2018,5,So beautiful!!,"Stunning interior. Excellent location, in the Médina. Parking close by. Great price. Beautifully appointed rooms, comfy bed spa and linens, good shower. Modern chic and perfect decor. Pool was a life saver in August. Wonderful rooftop for chilling in the early morning or evening. We had breakfast each morning which was delish, and sweet to have it on our own little balcony. We had a large room on the top floor, which was private and overlooked the entire inside courtyard. Staff was super helpful and kind. Excellent service! Highly recommend.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2018,4,"Cool, Contemporary and Classic Riad","We stayed here for a couple of days, starting at the Eid al-Adha, so to be perfectly fair, the Riad was likely not fully staffed given the nature of the holiday. The check in process was slow - it's always a process - but this one took an exceptionally long time. The room was on the top floor on the side of the Riad's entrance. The room and bathroom were large and generally well appointed. The safe in the room was small, lacked instructions, and was not bolted down to anything so it ended up not being used. Breakfast each morning was selectable and abundant. The inside of the Riad is closed off, which keeps the interior space quite warm, but there was exceptionally powerful A/C in the room, and a really nice roof top terrace with seating, lounge chairs, and a Bluetooth…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2018,5,Awesome Riad,"The riad is centrally located. 5-7 min walk to the famous blue gates. From there you can access all parts of the city and the old medina. This was my first riad and it was very nice. Rooms are spacious, the place is always spot less and it has a terrace that lets you see the old medina and the new city at sunday. Great to hang out and take pictures. Its very quiet all day and when you want to relax from the chaos of the city, just go back and sit by the pool. Is great to wake up and have Breakfasts ready at your table of choice. The staff is super attentive and they were always looking ways to improve my stay at the riad. They went above and beyond as i got food poisoning and they provided me with some medicine to help with the issues.

The location perfect. Everything that matters in Fez within walking distance. Mohammed and Mohammed were dedicated and more than helpful, lovely guys. They made our stay almost perfect. No, they made it perfect, because at our request they put out the much too loud and unnecessary muzak.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes

The rooms are lovely- ours had a huge terrace overlooking the courtyard. The tiles and colors are stunning. On the roof is a lounge area that overlooks Fes and the Medina and it is cool and relaxing there. The breakfasts were plentiful and arranged at a time that was convenient for us.

 May 2018,5,Beautiful Riad,"We arrived to Riad Braya after a a 4 day trip through the desert & what a treat it was. This Riad is beautiful, clean and had a luxury feel to it.

 March 2018,5,Really nice,During our Morocco trip we spent a few days in Fes at this riad. What a fantastic place. We couldn’t believe how nice the room was!

We also took many pictures on location because the decorations were beautiful. Will definitely recommend!",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2018,2,Worst Riad I stayed in,"Have stayed in a few Riads this time around and this by far the worst and I am glad my stay is over. THE GOOD: - Riad from inside is pretty good THE BAD: - super commercial, service, if you want to see authentic Moroccan hospitality experience don’t come here. Last day they suggested that we leave 8am so they don’t have to give us breakfast (which starts at 8:30am) - They suggested we take a guide to see the Medina, and arranged a guide who (besides us repeatedly telling him) spent 90% time taking us into shops where we had to go through a stressful process of saying no to each shop owner. Total waste of money time and lot of stress. It was a 3 hrs tour we ended it in 2hrs and then went out ourselves to explore the colourful streets. - Didn’t replenish toiletries in the…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2018,5,Amazing hotel - a must!,"This is a must for anyone looking to stay in Fes. Firstly the staff (both Mohameds) are unbelievably helpful, kind, friendly and informative. They helped us (three guys in our mid-20s) with suggestions of where to go, good day-trip ideas and general suggestions for local things to do (hammams, restaurants etc.). The riad itself is stunning, and located in a great location; a short walk from the medina and you can also be dropped off by taxi only 3 or 4 minutes away (note this is very handy as the medina is completely carless, so if you went for a hotel in the middle of it then you’d have a bit of a walk on your hands to any transport!). The room we had was great – a suite with a balcony – and very well-priced, although we did go in the low season. An awesome rooftop which…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,5,Amazing stay at Riad Braya!,"I have greatly enjoyed my stay at this beautiful Riad. I traveled by myself, but the moment I stepped foot into the Riad, Mohamed made me feel like home. I was greeted with a smile and with the traditional the a la menthe and cookies, and I was given my space to enjoy the treats. Mohamed then took me to my room, a beautiful double bed with a nice bathroom overlooking the inside courtyard. I wished I stayed longer than 1 night, but I would love to come back to Fes some day and I would only choose this Riad. Hicham was also very kind, carrying my bag to the taxi stop and meeting me at the taxi drop the night I arrived in Fes. Trying to navigate the medina by yourself at night is a bit overwhelming, so I really appreciated the fact that Hicham was there to meet me and take me to…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2017,5,Exotic .. beauty and calm,"First of all, do not expect 5 stars hotel services. However the hotel interior, landscape, architecture design and atmosphere are as cool as 5 stars hotel. The concept is unique but luxurious. Room is clean and duo Mohammed are very friendly and helpful. They speak English fluently and stand by always. The only flaw which i can tolerate is the beverages and foods service are a bit slow since the staff who handles everything in once is only one person. Basically Mohammed looks after everything, reception / front desk to room services and serving meals. Having the hotel with 5 floors , only one person who is on duty is handling everything, i think is too much. Therefore there was delay in certain requests.

 September 2017,5,Unforgettable Stay in Fes,"I generally do not leave hotel reviews but in the case of my recent stay at Riad Braya I feel especially obligated. First, because of how wonderful our stay was but second, more importantly, because I feel that where you stay in Fes seems more crucial than most other places I have traveled. The reason I say this is it's wonderful location but more so because there isn't much of a nightlife in Fes. To be able to relax at the riad after everything shuts down and have a drink or coffee/tea on the rooftop is simply amazing. I know if we stayed elsewhere our time in Fes wouldn't have been so memorable. All of the 5 star reviews are spot on. We stayed for 2 unforgettable nights and couldn't be happier.

The Riad is so beautiful and clean, everything was perfect. I decided to stay another night just to enjoy the place. I brought lunch in some restaurant and couldn't eat it, I brought it with me and asked if they can keep so I can have it for dinner.

He was always calm and patient and provided excellent service. Both Mohammed's and the kitchen staff were so kind and helpful.. they have really done an excellent job. The Riad is gorgeous and our room was lovely. You enter from a small side street into a gorgeously central courtyard that has a pool to dip into after a long hot day of touring.

I can't recommend it enough. it made our hectic stay in fez a true gem. Mohamed even brought the amazing breakfast to the rooftop himself (something like 4 trips up and down 5 stories), with breathtaking views.

The WIFI worked. The breakfast was wonderful and we could have had it in our room, on our balcony or on the terrace. We chose the terrace overlooking the city of Fes. What a wonderful way to start the day. We also ended our day with dinner on that same lovely terrace. Our room was huge! The bathroom was clean and beautiful.

Had we have done this it would saved us at least 30 minutes. Similar to fellow reviewers we immensely enjoyed our stay for the following reasons. Location - Conveniently located in the medina. An easy 9 -15 min walk to hundreds, I mean hundreds of artisan shops, cafes, juice bars, mosques and historic sites. Decor - A sea of dark blue mosaic greet you the moment the door opens.

Although our room was quite dark, once we stepped outside of the room, it was beautifully bright. I have to point out the roof terrace with breath taking views over the medina, we spent a lot of time up here, both in the morning while eating breakfast and in the evenings.

It couldn't have been a more perfect base. I was looked after so well and it had the feel of a super luxurious five star hotel but without the stuffiness - it felt so cosy and homely! This is awful but I've forgotten the name of the gentleman who looked after me while there - not 100 per cent sure if he was the owner or not - but he was the loveliest guy ever, going above and beyond and helping me with anything I needed.

 April 2016,5,Incredible service; incredible room; incredible terrace!,"This truly was a fantastic stay - we booked the junior suite for our honeymoon but Mohammed had upgraded us without charge and without our knowledge until we realised at the end of our stay. The location is superb as well - it's on the edge of the Medina so very quiet and in a safe neighbourhood, but still close enough to reach shops, ATMs, taxis and good restaurants in a few minutes. Also, the view from the terrace is one of the best in Fes - eating breakfast up there each morning was one of the high points of our trip. Also take advantage of the airport pickup as the place is a little difficult to find if arriving at night and/or with lots of baggage - the service was professional and similarly priced to taxis if you're feeling a bit taken aback by Morocco.

It has a perfect balance between traditional architecture and modern furnishings so you never feel overwhelmed. Upon arrival we were welcomed with biscuits and mint tea, as there was a slight confusion with our booking we got upgraded to a beautiful suite with a private balcony that overlooked the balcony. I can't be any more thankful to the staff for this upgrade as everything about the room and en suite bathroom was perfect. It made me feel like a princess looking over my very own court yard.

We were treated to the most sumptuous traditional Moroccan breakfasts which he personally served on the patio outside our room which overlooked the traditional Moroccan courtyard of the Riad.

 December 2015,5,Oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Fes,"I posted this review on hotels.com as well. But I am re-posting here since I want to make sure this place gets as much publicity as possible (it was that good!) This place is an oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the old medina in Fes. It is centrally located so that you are right in the middle of the action. At the same time the decor and the ambience of the place is such that it has a very calming and relaxing effect after you come back from your day in the medina. The hosts are extremely helpful and friendly. They set us up with places to eat (even a place with authentic Moroccan vegetarian cuisine that was outstanding!!), tour guides for the medina and also Meknes/Volubilis. They were courteous and attentive to all our needs and paid attention to every little…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2016,4,Amazing Riad with high ceiling and yet modern,"If you appreciate the Moroccan culture and architecture but also want something comptempory at the same time then this is the perfect place for you. Loved to come home to the beautiful courtyard be it day or night, it just calms you down once you step in. The 2 attendants at the Riad are friendly and attentive but not helpful if you ask for advice on restaurants or directions, you need to come prepared where you would like to visit or dine and they are delighted to help you for reservations. The rooms are not big but comfortable, however, the room I had was very noisy each morning from the alley with kids shouting at 6:30 as the location is very close to a local high school. Overall, I would recommend this Riad as I have seen quite a few in the neighbourhood that was much…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2015,5,Lovely riad,The staff could not do enough for you. Tried to cater for all your needs. Pick up from airport and guides arranged all arrived in time and were reliable. Dinner at the riad was expensive but the best meal we had in Fez. An oasis of calm.,Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2015,5,Great Big Suprise,"We got to the hotel (me and my two kids). Youssef opened the door and welcomed us to the most amazing, breathtakingly beautiful Riad. We got welcome tea and Moroccan cookies while he asked us for our shoe size to fit us with personal Moroccan slippers. We pre-chose our breakfast from an amazing selection. The service, the rooms, the hotel is the most beautiful, well decorated Riad. We felt like we were in a Moroccan palace. Amazing service and rooms. Youssef was there to guide us and help us. Super friendly service. My children didn't want to leave. Definitely we will be back - the kids (10 and 12) can't stop talking about it.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2015,4,decent enviroment,"Wonderful hotel with magnificent design in old medina and you can see the panoramic view of the medina from rooftop. Decent room. However, don't expect a lot of restaurants around. The hotel keeper did try the best to get you some sandwiches as late dinner as we came back late from visiting Sahara. If you want to try the Moroccan menu of the hotel, do inform them a day earlier. Other than this minor issue, the hotel is just so great.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2015,5,Excellent Riad,"Having watched the Sex and the City movie where the girls travelled to mystical Morocco and stayed in a riad, my expectations were truly high when we checked into Braya and over the two night they were met to perfection. Breakfast was a splendid offering thanks to the host Yusof and the atmosphere fitted the mood very nicely. I highly recommend this for Fez vacation.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2015,4,Would be perfect if not the parking,"First of all I want to thanks Mohammad (receptionist) who not only friendly welcome us but helped us to solve some problems with local people. He is really helpful, nice and friendly. Always first to help you and give you advice in this crazy city. The hotel is also really nice, clean, has great rooftop where you can have breakfast or drink. So everything is perfect. The only problem that we had was parking. This is not great hotel if you have car. On hotels.com was mention that there is a parking. The parking is on a street and it's quite hard to get there (especially when you are new in a town). In Fes there are a lot of local people who are trying to help you. But they want money for this and, yes they will help you get to your hotel, will show you where to park your car…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2015,5,Beautiful Riad and excellent staff!,"Our stay at Riad Braya was wonderful! The room was very clean, the Riad is beautifully designed and the staff is exceptional. The food is amazing - I highly recommend eating dinner here as well as the morning breakfast was delicious each day. Stay here and you won't be disappointed!",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2015,5,Just perfect!,"Had the pleasure of spend four nights at this beautiful riad, and would go back in a heartbeat. The interior of this place is magnificent, a real paradise. While the hotel, rooms, rooftop patio and pool area were delightful, what made the experience even more special was the staff. Youssef was the most polite, professional and accommodating hotel manager, always making sure we were comfortable. He provided us with excellent recommendations for restaurants (even walked us to one that was a bit hard to find to make sure we'd find our way) and booked us great tours of Fez and the region. And as we were the only guests in the riad, we got upgraded to superior rooms. The restaurant in the hotel is also excellent. We even asked about a specific Moroccan dish we like that was no…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2015,5,Beyond AMAZING!,"It's a beautiful Moroccan style riad in the middle of the old medina. The service is the best you can get, Youssef the host is the nicest man ever. We even got free Morrocan slippers from him. I would surely visit Fes again, just to visit this riad again.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2015,5,"Beautiful, Clean, and Hospitable Staff",I had the luxury of being the only guest when I arrived and the staff upgraded me to a larger room. The area by the pool is great for lounging and chatting with friends. They have a modest bar and snacks. The terrace has an outstanding view and an area to sit and day dream. It is a beautiful riad in a quiet area. Joussef and Hicham were wonderful hosts and went above and beyond expectations.,Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2015,5,Fantastic place !,"Im a very difficult client .... But this place exceeded my expectations. Simply beaultiful decor , wonderful place .... Not to mentione VERY SECURE place to b in . With ur familly .... Or alone ! Either ur stayin there or just passing by , make sure to stop by for a nice dinner....

 June 2015,5,Excellent staff and accommodation,I recently visited the riad Braya whilst in Morocco for work and it was absolutely excellent. The staff were highly accommodating and really made the stay pleasant. An absolute must if your visiting Fes. Will definitely use again.,Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2015,5,Beautiful calm Oasis in a colorful city,"Our first experience with Riad Braya was Mohammed meeting us at an area where our guide dropped us off as it was the farthest the vehicle could enter into the narrow streets. Within 2 minutes Mohammed was there greeting us with a warm smile and ready to take our bags. We chatted on the walk to Riad Braya and he gave us information on the Riad. As we entered it was a sense of going back into another time. The Riad is breathtaking and although the streets seem narrow and untraveled it really is a short walking distance from everything. We were served the customary welcoming mint tea with assorted pastries in the lovely courtyard as Mohammed prepared our documents for our stay. He left no detail out, he described dinner which is really what you want to do in Fez, eat in late…",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2015,5,Excellent experience,"Our daughter booked this hotel for us because it is located very close to where her host family lives (she has been studying at ALAF this academic year). We couldn't have been more pleased!! The staff is the most attentive & pleasant we have experienced in all our travels. The rooms are spacious & very clean. The food delicious etc etc. we would highly recommend this hotel!! Ps the staff booked drivers to give us private tours, even as far as Rabat.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Amazing place to stay,"Very clean, quiet and comfortable riad. Nice and helpful (not too pushy) staff. Cooked-to-order breakfast was excellent. We arrived too late for dinner. The staff instantly presented to make fresh Moroccan salads for dinner. They surprised us with a table full of salads at a very reasonable price. The riad also serves wine, which can be hard to find in the medina. The location is close to the main attractions of the medina.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2015,5,Great stay,"From the welcome mint tea to the farewell speech by our host (Mohammed), every minute at the Riad Braya was great! First, the restoration of the beautiful property is neat. Decoration also beautiful and luxurious. Very important to mention that rooms are immaculately clean and very comfortable. We stayed in a suite and all the furniture was classy and luxurious. The rooftop terrace offer a really nice view of the Medina. Since it is in the center you can walk to the main attractions in a few minutes. Best of all is the service. Our host Mohammed took care of us to the minimum detail. Breakfast included was fresh and always served beautifully. Also made very good recommendations and arranged all our tours. All the staff was more than kind. We highly recommend Riad Braya.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2015,5,A elegant hotel with a quaint old-times charm,"My family spent three nights at Riad Braya. It made the trip to Fes memorable and special. The hotel is located in the Medina (walled city) and has an elegance that is equisite. Its rooms are well maintained and provides an ambience that takes one back in time. The staff at the hotel or among the most courteous one has seen. They guided us on the places to see in and around Fes, looked after us and made us feel truly at home. The sumptous customized breakfast was a wonderful way to begin our day. If you visit Fes, dont miss out on the hospitality of Riad Braya.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2014,4,The closest to perfect,"One of the best hospitality property and service i have experienced - nice atmo, lovely suites, decent location, good price, good food and above all, excellent service from very attentive Riad staff. Very highly recommended!!",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2014,5,Memorable trip!!!,"Went on advice from a friend who is originally from Fez for our wedding anniversary: greeted with a lovely surprise in our suite! The Riyad has been beautifully and authentically restored by Mr Benkirane. The warm, friendly staff gave a lot of helpful advice on tours and shopping in the medina. A wide variety for breakfast (moroccan and continental). Clean, comfortable spacious suites. Quiet and practical location in the Medina: easy access to the souks and the taxis, 2min drive to the mall when you want a break from local cuisine. Overall great experience, would definitely recommend!!!!",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2014,3,Content Aussie travellers...,"This riad is gorgeous with an amazing view from the rooftop, where we enjoyed a fabulous breakfast everyday of our stay. The rooms are well decorated and extremely clean, however the bathroom wall is glass and therefore lacked privacy when on the toilet - this is a big pet hate of mine... It is in a great location though and it is really easy to walk to the old walled city centre. The staff were very friendly but attention to detail with service was slightly lacking. We often couldn't find staff to assist us when needed and they were unable to provide us with the relevant information we required for travelling to Chefchaouen, which was unhelpful and really hindered our travel plans. Overall, the riad is lovely though and we had a nice experience.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2014,3,Almost,"This is a lovely. Staff are friendly and try very hard. The manager arranged train tickets for us which was very nice and saved us a lot of trouble before arriving we arrange for a lovely meal. The Riad is very clean and our room was large and comfortable. They also arranged a guide for us, we did ask at the last minute, but the guide was not very good and only took us to commissioned shops and no sites. Our second night we requested dinner again, in their defence we didn't prearrange it, but dinner took over an hour to be served although they did apologize we sat for over an hour with being offered bread a drink or anything. Overall we would stay again and as this is a relatively new Riad I'm sure they'll work out the kinks in the future.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2014,5,Stay here!,"We were in constant disbelief that this incredibly elegant riad was host to only 7 rooms! The courtyard was grand and gorgeous, the rooms were comfortable, unique and spacious, and the expansive terrace offered amazing views of the medina, Fezand beyond. You will feel like you are staying in a palace! Be sure to take advantage of having their delicious breakfast up on the terrace. Josef and his staff were accommodating and always pleasant. We would highly recommend staying at Riad Braya.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2013,5,Excellent place to stay in Fez,"My wife and I stayed there for three nights in mid December 2013. We had a great experience and a great stay. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, they really treated us as their personal guests. We had a problem with our luggage and the airline and they really helped us. The main room/lobby is stunning, the guest room we stayed in was large, well appointed, and very clean. We had breakfast every morning on the roof; great view and great breakfast. (Could use a curtain around the shower). If you go to Fez and want to stay in the old medina stay here.",Riad_Braya-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Braya,Fes_Fes_Meknes
