 December 2022,5,Wonderful hotel close to many things,"We stayed as a family for 3 nights on the Tangier part of our Moroccan vacation. This hotel was across from the train station and Tangier city mall and a block or so south of the main Tangier beach and boardwalk, so easy walking distance (1/2 hr or so in either direction) of the marina and Malabata area. Room was very comfy and modern, nice size pull out bed for our daughter. Nespresso and water in room free of charge. Breakfast was good, lots of variety. Front desk arranged a tour for us with a guide, which was fantastic and hit all the sights we wanted to see. The bar could’ve been a bit better, but we were able to get a cold beer and a glass of wine. Overall a great hotel!",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,hotelName,city
 December 2022,1,Spa,"The worst experience ever. Instead of 1.5 hours massage I received only 30min massage. Reception cannot speak English, I ended up waiting at the reception for my friend who received 1.5 hours massage there. Instead of relaxing evening I had the worst time ever arguing and waiting for my friend. They offered another 1 hour massage but the therapist looked like she was about to cry when we went to the room. I didn’t want a massage from someone who was very unhappy and unprofessional.

 October 2022,3,Not sure how this can possibly be a 5* hotel,"I must admit that I am surprised with the vast majority of reviews on here that are giving the Royal Tulip City Center Hotel 5 stars. There is simply no comparison between this hotel and true 5 star hotels. There is nothing remotely outstanding or memorable about the Royal Tulip. The location is good; it's near the main train station of Tangier, as well as the Medina area. I think there is a shopping centre nearby. It's just off a main road where taxis are easily available. Check in staff were pleasant, but nothing special. The room was fine, but not thoroughly cleaned when we first entered. The curtains were somewhat dirty and so was the carpet in some areas. The size of the TV was tiny compared to the size of the wall. The main issue I had was with the shower bath.

 May 2021,1,Objective feedback,"I will be very objective in my feedback, I have made several hotels in Morocco of different categories. I spent three nights at the Royal Tulipe and it does not deserve its 5 stars, it is at most a 3 stars. the quality of service is very low. the food is cheap. the room service is very bad, the reception is not professional. the breakfast which is included in the stay is of very poor quality, you can eat in a cafe better than that. the hotel is soundproofed there is traffic and there is noise from outside. the wifi is very bad I had to work on my data. It is a pity that a hotel to be well located is to degrade that its level of reception, rooms, catering. the hotel is expensive compared to the other hotel whose quality is 10 times better",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

I enjoyed my massage, along with the pool and sauna (they could be a little quieter in the spa area as there were staffs taking loudly outside my massage room for half the massage). Breakfast was plentiful, and they made efforts to provide me with Vegan options. Houssaine even sent me up lovely flowers and a fruit platter.

Our intent was to stay one night and search for other hotels in the area; we ended staying at the Royal Tulip all three nights. We were in a large comfortable room on a higher floor with views of the mountains. Since we wanted to travel to Chefchaouen, Hajar at the front desk arranged a driver for a day trip there. She was charming and beautiful and loved practicing her English with my wife. She seemed genuinely excited when my wife asked to extend our stay. All of the staff was wonderful.

 January 2020,3,Okay stay,"We stayed for two nights--and, that's one night too many to stay in Fez. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel and made the mistake of not deciding on a price before they took us. Upon getting out of the taxi, we tried to settle the bill, and the driver tried to pull one on us, but the concierge helped us with setting things straight. So that was nice. We got in around 21:00 or so and were only given Moroccan tea on our arrival (some people have said a snack, too?--we didn't get any and were super hungry.) Check-in was simple. Bell hop took our suitcases to the room. Our room was HUGE and HOT. This is December, why in the world is it so hot in the room? Glad that we could open the patio door. We kept it open all stay.

We were too early by three hours as it turned out. We sat down and after an hour we were presented with a chocolate bon bon. Weird. Then about 30 minutes after that we were presented with a martini glass half-filled with a cold seafood bisque. No spoon, you just had to find a way to gulp it down.

As it was hidden in the wallet under bills from shops it could not fall. After we went to check the room if everything is ok, we realized that from a bag of one money has also disappeared.

Disappointed last night to arrive as a walk-in at 8pm and being quoted the same price as any other customer, despite clearly signaling I'm a frequent customer. Complained on TripAdvisor and directly to management the next morning and I received the apologies I wanted and a complementary upgrade. The management, specifically Mehdi, was very attentive and responsive to my complaints, which is ultimately the best one can expect.

Well, I can tell you that my family went to this hotel when it was inaugurated back in the day. When my sister told me she has a conference there, I did not hesitate to decide to come and spend few days at the hotel and also visit with my sister. So, from Toronto Canada, I will God willing come to a hotel who impressed my family who are all travellers and know about hotels; and always stay in this hotel for the quality of the staff who are hired, the quality of the service which is being offered.

First of all I want to thank Mr Saad Boumraya to have such a high motivated and friendly team. Especially to Kaoutar and Lina at reception. Many days I saw that hotel was full , where I didn't expect so much. Breakfasts provide large variety. Cleanliness of rooms and common areas are also in high standards.

 September 2018,2,"*DO NOT USE THEIR LAUNDRY SERVICE, IT WAS A SCAM*","I asked the hotel if laundry service was available, they sent staff right away to pick my up clothes, they listed each item and then had me sign. The next day my clothes were delivered with a receipt that didn't mention price just the list of clothes with my signature from the day before. When I checked out of the hotel, I noticed a laundry bill of 1625 MMD, which is about $170 USD!!! Very surprising that they would overcharge like that, it felt like a scam.

They complained since they were there longer than i was, that the service wasnt good that they asked for things hours before and didnt get them fast(this is what they said) I on the other hand had a great experience I booked this hotel the night of my wedding as my room was cancelled in another hotel. Once I was checking in I saw the Barcelona team which was playing in town that week come in(maybe that's why the service was a bit slow, mind you it was August peak season) anyway back to the story.

 June 2018,4,Closest you can get to 5 star,"Very much enjoyed staying at this hotel. Stay was not perfect, but every issue was dealt with quickly and in an efficient manner. As usual staff lacks training and facilities lack inspection so it is up to the client to report things, but that is usually the case in Morocco (unfortunately). Very good location. Excellent breakfast. Very nice staff (except for SOME of the ladies who need to realize smiling is absolutely necessary when working in a hotel of this level).

 April 2018,1,Horrible,Hotel is overcrowded. Staff is inefficient. Breakfast and diner is a nightmarre. Room service is absolutely unprofessional. And the sport area is more a discotheque than a place where you practise peacfully ! The best is that they do not even propose a towel for the sport. You have to bring your own... To be avoided. Ah yes .. the best is that there are some ongoing work next to the hotels and workers finished at 23:00 and start at 6:00... great!,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The wall of the room as well as the floors are decorated with old photos of Tangier or some nice pieces of art that show parts of the city. The concierge desk is a very good place to get some ideas about what to do and how that can be organised. Thank you. The breakfast buffet was just good.

The breakfast combines local specials and global touch. The staff is cheerful across the board. If you need help ask for Sara.

We booked as a couple and received towels for 1 person, 1 bathrobe and all the amenities suitable for a single person (including the room type itself.)

Service staff very friendly. Breakfast buffet was outstanding. The most prominent assist was from the head concierge, Mr. Bouayad: he helped in several ways but especially in arranging our two all day outings with a car and driver to Chefchaouan and Asilah. The only downtick is that upon checkout the hotel did not offer us a choice to settle our account in dirham or in USD causing a surcharge of 3% due to their default USD option. By the time we discovered this practice it was a production to reverse and re-enter the transaction in dirham. Aside from this minor annoyance it was an outstanding experience all around.

If you speak english (or if you don't) ask for Badr. Badr speaks impeccable english and gave us amazing recommendations of where to visit and eat. I wish we could have taken Badr with us to the rest of the cities we visited in Morocco. Badr made us feel at home and became a smiling face we looked forward to seeing every morning.

We missed our flight with Royal Air Maroc because they had no check in attendant (AVOID ROYAL AIR MAROC) for a 5am flight.

Nice lobby cafe...and hotel restaurant was good too. Breakfast was lavish. ATM in lobby as well. For a Moroccan hotel, this along w the new Hilton, is a top choice for a quick jaunt in Tangier. Clean, friendly, and nicely designed. Bear in mind that once you leave the hotel, hawkers and would-be ""I'm not a guide!"" guides are all around the main beachfront promenade waiting for tourists to ""help"" but are then very difficult to shake. We had one who 'happened by' and then wouldn't leave us for 45 minutes - talking endlessly - and escorting us to the market...we had to get rather firm with him 5-6 times saying 'ok goodbye'…",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The entrance and half of the rooms overlook the railway yards and a building site. There appears to be a lot of new construction happening at that end of town. Our room (803) faced over the yards and was bright, clean and spacious. We didn't use our balcony due to copping smoke from neighbours next door. There are internet terminals on the ground floor opposite the tea salon. We didn't get to use these as they were being hogged by children. Breakfast had all of the usual suspects on the buffet but the highlight were the tiny individual desserts. An indulgent thing to have at that time of the day but small enough to have more than one.

It's actually in a very nice area with large buildings and hotels a short cab ride away from the touristic ""city center"" with the exotic chaos you would imagine and perhaps crave as you heard to Tangier. The hotel and its staff are extremely welcoming. Don't miss the tea and snacks in the lobby! So tasty! And the hotel breakfast is another don't miss.

 July 2015,5,Internship,"Passing an internship at the Royal Tulip City Center hotel was an eye opening experience for me. I passed it in the Sales and Marketing department with four, amazing staff members; Hamza Boulaich - Sales executive; Soumaya-Reservation Manager; Zainab-Senior Sales; Aicha - Sales Director. These people taught me so much about Sales, how the hotel functions, how reservations are taken care of, how to deal with customers etc. They demonstrated a strong and great work ethic that resulted from reliability, dedication, productivity, and cooperation. Not only were they great at work, but they were the nicest people. It is very important to go to work and feel loved by your co-workers and that's what these people made me feel like. They were always ready to help with huge smiles on their…",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 April 2015,5,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for one night, as the previous place that we were booked into was horrible. We were extremely tired from our holiday and wanted to just rest. The location itself was not great, but the Hotel more than made up for that. We ordered a twin room, and each of the beds were queen size. They are possibly the best hotel beds I have ever slept on. We were so tired, so ordered room service. The food was amazing, and they gave us extra treats which was an added bonus. The bathrobes was so soft, you did not want to get out of them.",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2015,4,Excellent two night stay,"Overall a very fine experience. My granddaughter and I had just two half days and a full day. To have the best experiences I sent several emails to arrange tours/guides in advance, including airport pickup. All went well, The concierge was very helpful. There was one small disagreement about an additional charge for extra guide time and car use, but it was resolved quickly by the concierge, Sammie.The hotel is new and accommodations are excellent. One of our two nights at the hotel was Sunday, during Ramadan. The restaurant was closed on Sundays during Ramadan,leaving o no usual option for eating in the hotel. But all was well because one of the front desk staff suggested we join the locals at iftar, the feast breaking the fast at sundown. Thus, we had a new, interesting and…",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2015,1,Not worth 4 stars let alone 5,"The hotel looks nice because it is newly built and the food is nice. But the service we have received is appauling which is why I have given this hotel the worst rating. The problems we have encountered include the following-out of our 6 day stay we had poor room service on 4 days On the first day we got no clean towels. Second day no tea, coffee or clean towels third day no tea coffee or toilet paper. 4th day despite going out for several hours our room was left un- serviced. I have received better service at 3 star hotels. They also advertise a spa at this hotel which doesn't exist. They advised us they would arrange for transport to take us to their sister hotel golden tulip to have a spa day. We had a driver take us their but on the way back the concierge ordered a taxi.…",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2015,4,Good 5* modern,"New 5* hotel in Tangier, good service, nice and comfortable rooms. I had lunch in the Spanish restaurant and the menu is really interesting, the dessert are the best.

 July 2015,1,Awful - beware!,"Awful - and I've never used that word before on here. And sadly I chose this hotel because of its Tripadvisor reviews. So I need to say these two things first: 1. Look at my reviews on here. I've written quite a few. I always try to be positive. 2. I came to this hotel during Ramadan. That's significant but shouldn't excuse anything. Remember, hotels have a choice whether to open and serve customers just as we have a choice to give them our money. So the single positive thing: My room was modern, well equipped, spotlessly clean and spacious. It had tea/coffee making facilities and two free bottles of mineral water. Thank goodness for the coffee and the water, as you will see. The negatives, in chronological order: 1. Poor reception service on arrival - it took 40…",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2015,5,Excellent,Had a great stay at this hotel. It wasn't too full therefore plenty of room for us. The pool was totally dedicated to one person. Very clean. Breakfast was included and excellent. Would definitely recommend if you don't want to be located near the old part of town. Taxis are affordable so not an issue getting there. 5 stars.,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2015,5,Royal Tulip is an exelent choice for good food good service and good staff,"I have been to Tanger six times since October 2014 and I literally watched them build this great place. If you like value with genuine and professional service Royal Tulip on Malabata is the place for you I would give it a sixth star since the price is so very reasonable: Breakfast buffet included and worth 150 dirims alone and then dinner buffet, whew the other night I had wonderfully fresh sword fish and chicken kabob and cafe au let and awesome truly great deserts. I am single and a freelance journalist and sometimes suffer from writer's block and the friendliness of the staff specially Mohamed and Fatiha and the sales executive hamza puts me at great ease and I write all night long!

 April 2015,5,Beautiful Hotel - Excellent Service,"Stayed for one night at this hotel and really loved it, would definitely stay there again should I be in Tangier. The surrounding area leaves a lot to be desired and it was a pleasure to have a long hot bath, get into the plush bathrobe, order room service and just chilling. Very spacious hotel room, beautifully presented.

 April 2015,5,Great hotel and staff!,"We stayed one day/night at the Royal Tulip. Upon check-in we had the pleasure of meeting the Chef Concierge (Mourad Boulmane). He was eager to ensure we had a great experience during our first trip to Morocco. My girlfriend was not feeling well as we arrived in Morocco and he offered to assist in getting medications for us at a local Pharmacy. Mourad provided exceptional customer service that seems to be a rare find these days. The hotel is new, thus very clean and nice. Mourad recommended we try the buffett as we were hungry upon arrival, and the food and the whole staff were exceptional and very friendly. It's this type of service that will keep us coming back. Next time we are in Morocco, we will definitely stay here and look forward to being greeted by Mourad and his…",Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hotel_Royal_Tulip_City_Center_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2015,5,Beyond Amazing Experience,"We had a most unfortunate experience trying to get to Tangier. All ferries from Tarifa were cancelled due to weather. We had a tight timeline and strong interest to get to Morocco so attempted the ferry from Algeciras. There had been no ferries for over a day so we were not prepared for what waited for us. What does this have to do with Royal Tulip? Well we were not going to be able to cancel with 24 hour notice but they were so wonderful to manage my circumstance, no penalty. They had arranged a ride from the feet which also had to be cancelled. Then it looked like we would get a ferry so I needed to re-book the room and arrange a ride from a ferry terminal much farther away. Again the Royal Tulip came through and managed to re-book me!!
