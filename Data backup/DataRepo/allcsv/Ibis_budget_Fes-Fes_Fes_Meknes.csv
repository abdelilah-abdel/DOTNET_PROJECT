So the last day they called us at 2 p m and said that we need to leave the hotel. We said ok, we would find another hotel for one more night. When we were taking our stuff from our room they charged us to pay for the half of the day of stay. The question is? Why the stuff did not call us at 12:00?

 December 2018,4,Practical and Close Enough,"This hotel served as my base point to visit the medina. It is close enough (just a short distance by car) and enough far from the more agitated streets. I found the quality of the rooms good (although you can hear quite loudly even the smallest noises from the corridors) and the staff was very kind. The only downside was that the room where the breakfast is served seems to be under-dimensioned, considering the number of guests that the hotel is capable of hosting. This means that the waiting time for having breakfast may be longer than usual or that you won't be able to find a seat once you pick up your food from the buffet.

Fly to Fez and hire a car to drive our way via Meknes and Ouzoud to Marrakech. Our first hotel of our trip was the Ibis Budget hotel of Fez. We had a “friends”-room (double beds in bunkbed formation on 3 x 3 m). We chose not to stay in the Medina of Fez because of the probable noise of the old town, but this hotel was next to a busy rotonda… The beds are ok, the room was clean, the breakfast was nice (continental with a Moroccan touch). Strange thing that returning on the second day, our key did not work and they refreshed our 4 towels with three, but the hotel is worth its (budget) money.",Ibis_budget_Fes-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Ibis_budget_Fes,Fes_Fes_Meknes

When I complained to the receptionist but she said nothing could be done as I'd already paid for it. In other words I was stuck with it. The locality of the hotel looks run down and frankly rather unsafe. Its location also means its hard to get a taxi, having spent 20 minutes outside in the rain trying to find one. The size of the room is frankly tiny with virtually no standing room let alone room to accommodate the 4 people it claimed to do. The ""toilet"" has a thin semi door akin to public toilets, which provides almost no privacy for users, and no barrier from odours filling the room!

The hotel was very clean and even the cheapest room was sufficiently big and clean. The people at the reception are really so helpful. We had to catch a train to Marrakech at around 4 am and the person at reception literally ran on the road to arrange a taxi for us. PS. The view our room was great.

Given the shoulder season before winter coming, this budget hotel was just enough to rest after a tiring day. Check-in was brief although it's an SOP to fill up guest form for each adult. Everything else are typical of Ibis Budget worldwide; a double plus single bunk bedding setup with tv, A/C, shower, toiletries. Unlike branches in Europe, they don't give tea/coffee in sachets in Morocco. Not even bottled water.

However, you can take a petit-taxi (small red cars just outside of the station) for MAD 12-13. The driver will ask for MAD 20 or 30. Just say no and tell them to use the meter. If they don't accept it, keep going to the next car until you get one who will agree.

Pretty basic and aesthetically sterile, but functional and clean. Security is pretty good at them. 24 hour reception and you need a room key to use the elevator. There is a bus stop near to it, if you want to take public transportation, and there is always taxis available (they sit outside, but you can ask the receptionist to call one for you).
