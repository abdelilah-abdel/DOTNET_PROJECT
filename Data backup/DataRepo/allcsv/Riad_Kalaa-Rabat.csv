 September 2022,5,A lovely gem within the Medina,Upon arrival we were welcomed into the lovely courtyard by a beautiful young woman for a traditional Moroccan tea before shown to our 2 beautiful suites on the main floor.

 August 2022,5,Great place to stay at the Medina in style,"Clearly a bit higher priced, but if you like to spend your holiday in style, that is the place. Rooms are an interesting combination of traditional and modern design: we had a room with 4 beds, two downstairs & two in the loft. Shower worked well and was very hot. Very friendly staff. Terrace and small swimming pool on the roof, you just need to remind your kids no to splash too much, otherwise the water lands right on the breakfast tables 3 floors down .-).

 July 2022,5,Great Stay at the Riad in Rabat,"This was one of our favorite Riad's stays in Morocco. The Riad is well located and there are so many places to explore that are within walking distance of the Riad. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We didn't have the opportunity to have dinner at the Riad; however, I had a few cold beers at night while sitting in the square of the Riad. The rooms have great air conditioning and are all well decorated.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat

 June 2022,2,Loud disco music cannot sleep,"We thought this would be a nice place to sleep but The night we arrived they turn this into a discotheque blaring music on the rooftop so that no one could sleep. The owner decided to throw a party for his friends with complete disregard for hotel guess who actually wanted to sleep instead of party all night. As it was getting late and we had children with us and we’re all very tired from an early morning flight we went to the front desk to complain because the music seems like it would never stop, A person at the front desk ran upstairs and came back. Instead of an apology he just said they told him that the music would end sometime soon and there was nothing we could do about it",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2022,4,Lovely Riad,"We had a lovely stay at this Riad in the middle of Rabat’s Medina. Our favourite thing was the beautiful roof terrace, filled with plants and an adequately sized pool for a splash around. We adored drinking wine at sunset by the pool. The rooms are very beautifully done, and our bathroom was a very good size. We had an excellent hammam - extremely thorough and relaxing. Really recommend - 300 Dirhams for an hours hamman and a further 300 for a massage. The reason I have rated it 4 stars is because I think that for the price, the breakfast could have been more varied. It is a typical Moroccan breakfast with a variety of different breads, jam and butter, accompanied by a plate of fruit, orange juice and tea/coffee. It is quite typical of Morocco yet there were some staples…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2022,5,Great dining experience,We only went here for dinner as we stayed in the sister-Riad Dar Dar but we where mesmerized by the place. One of the prettiest Riads we have seen in Morocco.

 March 2022,5,Traditional Riad,"This was our first experience in a Riad and it was great! The staff was very helpful. The setting was very atmospheric and beautiful. It felt like a respite from the outside world even though its located in a very quiet part of the Medina. They have excellent food here and unless you are staying in Rabat for several days or more, we would see no reason to eat dinner elsewhere. Our upstairs room was very quiet and comfortable.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2022,4,"Nice Courtyard, Two Level Rooms","Close to the edge of the Rabat Medina, it is relatively asy to reach and leave. We were warmly greeted by the host with mint tea as is the habit in Morocco. We were lead to our room on the bottom floor of the Riad, an oddity. The ground level of our room had two single beds; the bathroom, well appointed but a little dark was on the second floor, on the same level as the comfortable queen bed. The staircase is narrow and awkward making it a challenge for someone with balance issues. The decor is definitely Moroccan and it’well done. The inner courtyard is very nice. The breakfast and dinner we had there were ample and tasty. If it wasn’t for the awkward staircase, we would recommend this Riad without reserve.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2021,5,A Great First Step into the World of Moroccan Riads,"The Riad Kalaa was our first experience with a Riad in Morocco. For the uninitiated, a riad is a type of traditional Moroccan interior garden or courtyard associated with a house or, even in some cases, a palace. The Riad Kalaa is old and beautifully maintained, and the staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely friendly. Like so many riads, Kalaa is a sanctuary of sorts from the hustle and bustle of the city. We were warmly greeted and shared mint tea and cookies which is a time honored tradition in Morocco. Our hosts were helpful giving us the lay of the land and encouraged us to have a glass of wine on the roof before dinner. The sunset was amazing. Our room was decorated in traditional Moroccan style and amazingly similar to a place we stayed in Bukhara,…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2021,5,3 week Moroccan Holiday,"When people speak of Moroccan Riads you just can't imagine until you are in one. This place was truly an oasis of calm and tranquility. Tea offered upon arrival, to just chill after the noise and heat of the day. We called ahead so lunch was waiting for us. I can't say enough about the woman who greeted us, so good at her job. Wine was available with our lunch and then onto the rooftop. After lugging our baggage upstairs we sat on the roof for yet another glass of wine. Morocco in October was way more hot than I expected. Note to self, visit in November. Pool is not big but the area is just so relaxing. walk up another stair to the terrace for views of the city. Our room was tight with all our stuff but the bathroom is large and good counter space. Water and fruit in the room.…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2021,5,Charming Riad,"A charming riad. Our first location on our trip. We stayed 3 nights. The staff is very welcoming and you are made to feel comfortable as soon as you arrive.

The food was also excellent.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat

 September 2021,5,Must stay accommodation,"Amazing, made to feel like a V.I.P from the moment I arrived. The room was the biggest iv ever stayed in with a bath for two and a bed for 8. The swimming pool on the roof with birds coming down to drink was magical. Had local massage and hamman, which blew my mind followed by a loverly evening meal on site. A definite return visit in needed.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2020,5,A Wonderful Oasis,"Riad Kalaa was an exquisite place to stay while in Rabat. It was our first night of a 10-day adventure and it helped get us off on the right track. The mint tea and treat welcome was especially nice. When in Morocco, staying in riads proved to be so much better than hotels.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2019,4,Warm and welcoming boutique hotel,"Riad Kalaa was our first hotel stay (1 night) on a multi-city trip to Morocco. It was an interesting walk and journey to the the Riad through the narrow alleyways (keep your eyes peeled for all sorts of things that you can step in accidentally :-) ). Guests are were welcomed with a glass of wonderful Moroccan mint tea and a wine list. The hostess was very warm and welcoming.     The hotel itself is lovely and cosy (ish) with nice and clean rooms/bathrooms. The Riad is built around a central courtyard like traditional Riads. The rooms downstairs open out straight into the courtyard / restaurant. We enjoyed the Riad for what it was (boutique, authentic hotel), however, it could do with some more modern levels of comfort (which unfortunately would make the hotel less authentic).…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2019,5,Excellent launch point,"Coming into Rabat for the start of our Moroccan journey, this was an amazing introduction to food, service and culture. The food here is just as amazing as the decor, and the wonderful service. From arrival tea to departing breakfast.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat

 December 2019,5,Finest to Stay In Rabat,"Thank you Team @ Riad Kalaa. Great place to stay very quiet, simply great breakfast of the freshly baked croissants, and of course some great choice of cheese and bread and of course freshly home made yoghurt The Hostess Ms. Fatima was great who took proper care of our amenities ( 9 people in all ) and surely recommend one to stay",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2019,5,Amazing stay and food,"We stayed 3 night at Riad Kalaa. Had 2 out 3 suppers in Rabat and everything was amazing. From the staff, to the rooms, to the decor, cleanliness, to the food, atmosphere etc all perfect or more. We lived 4 years in Rabat in late 70ies and early 80ies and came back for this emotional visit surprised one can now stay at the Medina. I decided to go for this more authentic hotel rather than a traditional hotel. We were 10 people in our party, 5 adukts, 2 teens and 3 kids... and everyone was delighted. Kids had space to roam inside the hotel. All rooms give on an internal courtyard, so you don’t even need to lick your room to go dine and after the chaos of the day visit, we were more than happy to cone back to our Oasis of peace for supper. The food was authentic and at a…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2019,5,Amazing Wedding Location,"We had the chance to celebrate our wedding at Riad Kalaa. It was an amazing day at a unique location! Riad Kalaa team made our dream come true to marry in the Medina of Rabat, having a Riad for one weekend just for us, friends and family. All your support before, during and after the wedding was absolutely outstanding! We will definitely come back to celebrate our wedding anniversaries ;-)",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2019,5,Modern riad,Very nice modern style riad with stylized features in the rooms. Nice departure from all the traditional ones for a change. Have to walk a bit to get there from the nearest car park so if you have lots of luggage it can be a pain.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2019,4,Quaint and welcoming establishment,"We used a travel agent to book our hotels on our trip to Morocco and so we expected to be lodged in full-service establishments, which this is not. We were somewhat taken aback when we arrived here to find a fairly basic Riad. And then offered a room right off the central courtyard, affording very little privacy. However, upon some discussion with our agent, we were offered a more private room upstairs, which was lovely. The Riad has very updated rooms and bathrooms and we were very comfortable. Our host was gracious and we had a good night. Just know before you go that it is a quiet part of the Medina, and so not sure if there is anyplace to go after dark and you will not have a glass of wine or a beer at the end of a long travel day unless you bring your own. Also, we did need…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2019,4,"A pleasant stay, friendly staff","The location of Riad Kalaa is def a plus, providing a good accessibility to different sides of Rabat city. The riad itself is great with a modern twist and very clean. I felt that the only downside was that there were no slippers inside the room (but the staff provided me with them as soon as I asked).",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2019,5,Beautiful and welcoming,What an amazing hotel. They sent a bellman to the street to help us get parked. Essential! Then we were welcomed into a lovely on the inside garden home w rooftop pool near the heart of the Médina and the Kasbah of the Uydayas. Breakfast was lovely fruit and breads and eggs to order.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2019,5,Simply exceptional in every way!,"From the moment of arrival until our departure, this beautiful Riad was our quiet sanctuary in the bustling city of Rabat! Centrally located near all the best sites, and a short stroll through the narrow streets of the Medina, we loved the privacy and beautifully adorned accommodations. The staff were all attentive to any requests. The roof top pool and lounge areas added to the luxury. Our most favorite surprise... dinner in the Riad with world class cuisine and service! The best meal in Rabat and a big “must” for any visitor! Thank you to everyone at Riad Kalaa for such a wonderful stay!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2019,5,Excellent Stay,Spent 2 nights at Riad Kalaa and had a lovely stay. Riad is well located and a great base from which to spend a couple of days to explore Rabat (2 nights in Rabat is enough as not that much to do).Staff lovely and room very comfortable - it’s a Riad so a bit quirky but that’s what to expect. Dinner was pretty good although it’s a set menu. Breakfast excellent. Overall would highly recommend.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2019,5,Exquisite,"During our tour of Morocco in April our stay in Rabat was made even more enjoyable by the Riad Kalaa. A truly delightful riad with a great atmosphere, a friendly and courteous staff, and wonderful food. The otherplust aspect is it's location in the medina which made it easy to wander around and find our way back. A definite enthusiastic endorsement from us.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2019,3,Be sure you prefer the style to the practical virtues of a normal hotel,"Riad Kalaa in Rabat is a very stylish and comfortable place but imperfect in certain respects: - The ground floor rooms open onto the reception and dining area, and have extremely poor sound insulation. Consequently we had to ask for the dining room music to be turned off at 10.45 pm one evening, and even after that some of our fellow guests were very noisy. In fairness this was a one-off during our four night stay, and M Mohammed was very apologetic, but it was a problem - The same problem presents itself in the morning; with kitchen and guests starting breakfast, on one occasion at 7.15 am - You can hear people walking around upstairs on the uninsulated wooden floors - The very stylish door openings into the room and the en suite are not practical for tall people, I banged my…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2019,5,Wonderful stay,"This was where we spent our first night in Morocco and we were very impressed with the beauty, comfort and attention to detail this riad offered. Staff helped with our luggage and helped us negotiate the narrow streets of the Medina. We were greeted with lovely mint tea and our room had some fresh fruit for us to enjoy. It was novel for us to have a sitting area on one floor and to find the sleeping area and WC on the 2nd floor. It was nice to enjoy a local beer while we waited to meet friends and go out to dinner in Rabat. Breakfast in the courtyard was lovely.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2018,4,Well maintained with friendly staff.,"We were a family of 3 couples with 2 little grand daughters ,driving from FES,in November 2018.The Riad as expected is in old part of town.The manager sent a friendly staff to escort from parking lot thru winding streets which was great .We were given refreshing cool drink & warm milk for infant child.The Riad is well maintained , check in was quick. We needed wine for dinner which was served in 1 of the 3 rooms we had.,The breakfast next morning was very good.The manager was very helpful in guiding us for our walking tour of nearby places.We were there for only 1 night as we were to visit Markesh next day,wish could have spent another night in Rabat.Our room was duplex with sitting downstairs ,bed & bath upstairs.Overall we were happy to be there in Riad Kalaa.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2019,4,Moroccan hospitality,"We were met at the entrance to the Medina by a staff member who took our luggage and guided us to the Riad. Check in was accompanied by cookies and super sweet mint tea. Our room was titled ‘Favorite’ and was a sitting room downstairs opening up onto the central courtyard, with the bedroom & bathroom upstairs. Whilst it was really well appointed, the bathroom lovely and the bed was super comfortable, going up and down stairs was a little tiresome. The staircase was so narrow there was no way our suitcases were going upstairs so our clothes were downstairs and we were upstairs 😂. Hubby swam in the rooftop pool which was a welcome relief after a long hot day. The dinner (included) experience was a little confusing. It seemed from the menu to be three courses but when we asked…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2019,4,visited as a party of 9 friends and family,"Deep in the bowels of an old fort - got there through long, narrow winding streets through a busy souk . The place was wonderfully well appointed, well furnished and the staff were all very friendly and were prepared to bend over backwards to help their guests. The meals were excellent and well prepared the Wi-Fi was good. As expected it was a long walk to the Riad and is easy to get lost but the staff will happily give you a map to find your way back. It would be best if your cell phone has GPS capability to help getting back. In spite of all the hustle and bustle on the streets one felt very safe there was not one incident for all 9 of us in all of Morrocco that made us feel uncomfortable.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2019,5,Exactly what I imagined!,"The place is set in the medina, so walking is a must. This was difficult for my 85 yr old mother, but she managed. Once there, WOW. There's a huge door that has a smaller door built in. You enter a dark foyer and then walk out onto a bright center courtyard. There are plenty of seats and tables with palm trees and greenery all around. We stayed in room Touareg on the lower level since Mom doesn't like to do stairs. I was inviting and cozy, nicely decorated with 2 beds, a sitting area (the chairs were way too small to sit in, maybe for children), TV, fireplace. The separate bath had a sunken tub, toilet, sink and bench to sit on. Very spacious. Tile floors were not sealed, so there seemed to be a little dust, but overall everywhere was spotless clean. We ate dinner here, 3…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2019,5,Fabulous in Rabat,"After 2 weeks of traveling throughout Morocco we had the great pleasure to check into Riad Kalaa2 within the Medina of Rabat. It is a little interesting walking through the alleys to get there but absolutely worth it! We were greeted with the biggest smile by Ms. Zimeb who sat us down to a delightful cup of Green Mint Tea while we registered. She showed us our amazing room (crystal clean and beautifully decorated), the roof terrace and roof pool, and asked what time we would like our breakfast. All with warmth and the desire for us to feel ""at home"". We decided to have our dinner at the Riad on the first night rather than seek out a new place. Dinner was being served in their sister Riad a 3 minute walk away - which Zimeb accompanied us to. The cuisine under chef Ms.…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2019,4,Almost perfect,"First off the Riad is very nice. Absolutely charming with lots of nice touches. Rooftop pool area is great for relaxing. Food and services were top notched. Check in was a bit disappointing. We were traveling with an agency, so booking was handled by our agency. Our driver called ahead of time before we arrived. Somehow check in was just confusing. They couldn’t find out who we were, not sure if they have our reservation, and waited like an eternity(after a long flight and all day of touring) before we can get our room. We have good experience with our travel agency, so I am pretty sure the problem is on the hotel’s end. The management just seem unorganized. The other thing would be NOT having a door separating the bedroom and the bathroom. They have a curtain there. …",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2019,5,First night in Morocco,"We stayed here our first night after arriving in Casablanca. Our tour Company Best Travel Morooco had arranged our stay. We were greeted with mint tea and cookies , relaxed in their foyer than were escorted to our rooms. Our room was on the second floor overlooking courtyard. Lovely room and lovely Riad, since we did not know what to expect. A pool was located on the floor as well, as a lounging area and another courtyard. Breakfast was exvcellent in the morning.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2019,5,Very Hospitable and Lovely,"This Riad is in a perfect location for exploring Rabat. The staff was very hospitable and helpful. Some reviewers have commented on the darkness of the rooms. I had a room on the first floor as I requested, and it was certainly dark. To me, this is to be expected when you book at a riad in the medina with thick walls all around. I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend it.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2019,5,Nice place to sleep off the jet lag,"We stayed here our first night in Morocco. We were greeted with mint tea and cookies in the courtyard and then shown to our room. The room was small, but well-decorated on the upper floor. They had a nice deck up there with a rooftop pool. It was too chilly for us to get in, but it was the only riad pool that I saw that seemed like I would like to use it in Morocco. The others were all in the courtyards and quite exposed! The breakfast was very nice and included with the room.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2019,4,Lovely little riad,"Stayed here for one night. Lovely clean place, though the room was very tiny and poorly lit. Besides that everything was perfect. Amin went out of his way to drag our suitcases down a long alley to reach the riad. Also organized some very good traditional dinner for us. Great breakfast too. Would surely recommend the place. Ask for ground level rooms if climbing stairs is a problem for you.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2019,4,"A pleasing, small and comfortable Riad","My wife and I stayed at this Riad whilst on a journey through Morocco during February. We decided that using trains and staying at Riad’s would form a central part of our journey theme and are awfully glad we did. Our main advice and booking was aided by Andy and Dawn Rediscover the world UK. They work with “Plan-it Morocco”, to make bookings. This Riad was very thoughtfully converted to the current use and is not too large. We spent a very short time in Rabat and were thankful for the handy positioning of this Riad. The breakfast was reasonably wide ranging. The staff were really helpful.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2019,5,A wonderful welcome to Morocco,"After travelling overnight and no sleep, we were welcomed to Riad Kalaa with mint tea and a wonderful room. Since we were too early for dinner in the hotel, we took a tour of the Medina (old city), with maps provided (very important). They even arranged for a Hammam (Moroccan spa/bath) at one of their other properties. It was to die for, washing away all of the aches and pains of a very long flight and car ride. Dinner was excellent, as was breakfast. The hotel staff were so warm and helpful.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2019,3,Dark rooms,Stayed here for our last night in Morocco. Staff came and met us at the car park to lead us to the riad. The riad is modern and trendy. Aesthetically very pleasing. The staff are friendly and helpful. The main problem are the rooms. They are dark. The door and windows open onto the terrace and pool so no privacy if you open the windows. The floor has sandy tiles but no slippers are provided. Overall there is more attention to looks but not practical.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2019,5,The best accommodation on our trip,"We spent two weeks in Morocco but only one night in this beautiful Riad. Our jaws dropped when we walked through the unassuming door into the gorgeous courtyard. The architecture and interior design were stunning. We had two rooms that were equally beautiful and we didn't mind that they were a bit small. The light fittings had me mesmerised, and really set the ambience. It is a little dim compared to western hotel room lighting, but you're in exotic Morocco, go with it! We had dinner in the restaurant of their other property and it was one of the best meals (although a bit expensive) that we had in Morocco. Breakfast in the courtyard the next day was an abundant feast. The food and the service was faultless. If I had to point out one negative I would say that the shower…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2018,4,Beautiful Riad,"The Riad has a beautiful courtyard inside. Life revolves around the courtyard with most rooms connecting to it. This results in some issues with privacy, but does make it easy to put the kids to bed and continue eating dinner. The Riad serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the courtyard. We had all three and all were good. Dinner is somewhat expensive though, and the pricing a bit quirky. On the other hand, the omelette I had at lunch was one of the best I've ever tasted. We were warmly welcomed on arrival and the staff were pleasant and helpful throughout Our room was a bit idiosyncratic, with one bedroom downstairs and one upstairs. The infrastructure seemed a bit ropey with poor wi-fi connectivity and power blinks. We paid quite a bit and I would say did not quite get…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2018,5,Very beautiful and cosy riad,We were very overwhelmed by its coziness and beautifully designed and decorated rooms. Each room is different and impressive. We arrived early in the morning and Amin was kind enough to wake up and helped us with our luggage through the alleys. Breakfast was delicious and nice. The only regret is that we could only stay for one night.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2018,4,Down a dark alley to a surprising gem,"We had our transport parked outside the walls of the Rabat Medina, with little idea as to what to expect having told our agent that we wanted to avoid international hotel brands and rather enjoy the local Riad hospitality. After a trek down alleys that one would really not like to venture through after sunset, faced with a door in a nondescript wall, entry was gained into the Riad Kalaa. Immediately received by our proprietor hosts with an offering of Moroccan Tea (Chinese Green Tea with a few Moroccan additives, wonderfully refreshing and a platter of biscuits, while we filled in the obligatory government registration forms. Our reception took place in a wonderful tranquil courtyard with a central fountain. We were then shown to our very comfortable doubled bedded room, with a…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2018,4,A gem,"Riad Kalaa was the first stop of our 11-nights Moroccan tour. We arrived in Rabat late in the afternoon and when we roamed through the maze of narrow streets with our guide, we were apprehensive as the surroundings looked sketchy, and getting there was not easy (even our guide got lost). We even witnessed a fight that erupted between a group of locals, so it was a relief when we finally made it to the riad and gosh, were we all pleasantly surprised. The place was beautiful and the staff most welcoming. We loved our room, which smelled clean and fresh, as was the bathroom. The terrace made a good hang-out place and was cozy. The only downside is the location. Being in the middle of nowhere, we did not dare venture out on our own. We made the error of entrusting our dinner…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2018,5,Spectacular Riad,"Visited Rabat in May and stayed at the Riad Kailas. Great value for money, beautiful Riad, amazing food,very clean Moroccan bedrooms. Nice terrace with a pool. Good location in the Medina, highly recommended!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Very nice place!,"Most of the rooms open directly into the common space. There is a nice pool and sunbathing area on the roof. The staff were very nice and the food was excellent. It was a little difficult to find, but the staff came out to meet us at the car and direct us in. Highly recommend!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2018,4,Amazing cozy room,"We stayed at the Riad Kalaa on our first night in Morocco. I must say, approaching did not give us much confidence, but once inside, we were amazed. From the courtyard you will find in almost every riad to the 30+ foot ceilings in the room, we liked everything we encountered. The upstairs pool is small, and certainly not perfect, but I am sure it is very much appreciated during the summer months. The staff was very friendly, spoke passing English and the included breakfast was good. Count on bringing your bags in a few blocks over cobblestone/brick streets.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Beautiful Riad and Great Customer Service!,"We went directly to Riad Kalaa after arriving in Casablanca from New York and it was like arriving in paradise! The interior courtyard is beautiful and there is a great little pool on the roof. Also the customer service that this riad extended to us was incredible. Everyone was courteous and helpful. They gave us and map, pointed out some sights to see and made sure that we knew how to find our way back to the hotel. They also made sure that my international cell service worked and showed me how to call the hotel if we needed anything. At my request, they had arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport and the same driver then drove us the next day to Fez with stops in Meknes and Volubilis. (His name is Abderrahmane Lidya and I would highly recommend him. Ask for him…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2018,4,Pleasant Riad,"We enjoyed our stay. Lobby atrium was pretty. Room was nice but smaller than other Riad’s we stayed in. Breakfast was good, with plenty of food. The Riad was hard to find so you may want to call and have them send someone to get you.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2018,5,Loved It,This Riad was awesome believe the hype. A little challenging to find via Taxi but overall a great experience and would definitely return. The court yard is beautiful as is the art work inside and loved the roof top pool.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2018,5,Beautiful Riad,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kalaa. It was a quiet oasis right in the historic medina, The rooms were a great surprise as they were really luxurious. The pool area on the roof top was a bonus. Would highly recommend you stay here as it will meet all your needs.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2018,4,Haven,"Small rooms but well air conditioned and staff v good. Has a good little pool on the roof, although could do with more seating sun beds. Food was good, but was expensive, the set meal that as $50 each. Breakfast as with everywhere in morroco is v substantial. Staff great and v welcoming.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2018,4,Lovely traditional riad,"If you want to be right in the historic medina, but separate from the hustle and bustle, this is a great choice. Roof terrace with its lovely little pool was a nice spot to relax, easy to get out and wander the medina for short trips when it was very hot before returning to the pool to cool off.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2018,3,Ok Riad,"Riad is ok, the best thing is the pool. A bit noisy inside and outside the Riad. The food just ok, salty and expensive. Service 3/5. Location is very good. Not the best place to sleep deeply. I would consider other options for the high price.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2018,5,Beautiful Riad with welcoming stadf,"We stayed here only one night during our trip, but all of the staff went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. They even arranged for transportation from our former destination and to our next. Very clean, a great view from the terrace and a fantastic pool.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2018,5,Fantastic Riad,"I stayed at Riad Kalaa for two weeks. I loved everything in it... my room, the courtyard, the terrace, the food, and the amazing staff, who would do anything to make you comfortable during your stay. The food is out of this world breakfast or dinner. The decor and architecture of the entire place is amazing. I will be returning to Rabat for work and Riad Kalaa will definitely be my number 1 choice.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2018,5,A perfect stay,"Had an amazing stay at Riad Kalaa - couldnt have been happier with our accommodations. Our 2 rooms on the upper floor terrace overlooked the pool. It was beautiful and peaceful. The food was incredible and service impeccable. A true gem. Hisham, the evening receptionist/concierge, was the most amazing host - whom we hired during the day as a guide. He was fabulous, we hired him the second day for the enjoyment of his company as well as his terrific help. Highly recommend this Riad, we look forward to returning again.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2018,5,Very stylish,"Our family of 6 stayed in this beautiful and stylish riad on our first night in Morocco. It was a wonderful introduction to the beauty of Moroccon architecture and design. Walking through the twisting narrow streets of the Médina, you enter the front door and step into a peaceful and welcoming environment. The rooms are beautifully furnished and renovated with great attention to detail. A lovely oasis.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2018,5,Riad style at its best,"Walking into to this riad from the dusty and crumbly alleys of the medina is a breathtaking experience. The cool, colorful interior is a wonderful example of what life in a riad was/is like. It is an intimate property with terrific and authentic decor. The staff is attentive, polite and efficient. It is not easy to find in the maze of the medina. But well worth the effort. Would highly recommend Riad Kalaa.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2018,5,Supreme Morocco,"Absolutely love this place! Although you feel Guilty staying in accomodation that is luxurious, while outside is another world, it has a warm inviting feel with great attention to detail and service. Well done Riad Kalaa!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2017,5,Slice of Heaven,"Absolutely love this beautiful riad! The welcome with tea and pastries was such a nice touch, the rooms were beautiful and clean, the atmosphere was out of a magazine. The meals are amazing and for non-Muslims who enjoy wine with dinner this is the place. The staff is unbelievably friendly and the option to receive massages is a nice touch after a long travel day or city tour. Conveniently located inside the Medina.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2018,5,A welcoming and lovely riad,"Not far inside the medina, Riad Kalaa is accessed off of a long alleyway, through a massive wooden door (actually, a door within a door, as is customary in many homes of this style—a smaller door with a higher-pitched brass knocker once used by female visitors set within a larger door with a massive knocker for male visitors). Once through that door, visitors/guests will find a lovely courtyard off of which guest rooms are set (with more upstairs, I believe). We were greeted with mint tea and cookies and given a map of the medina to help plan for our next day while our registration record was completed. Our room, La Sultane, was a duplex with two narrow single beds, two tables (one with a vase of fresh roses the other with a bowl of fresh fruit) on the first floor, and,…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2018,4,Great for Dinner.,"We highly recommend dinner at Riad Kalaa. It was delicious in a beautiful setting and at a great price. We stayed at the hotel as well but, unfortunately, found the room to be too dark and damp for us.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2018,5,Beautiful Riad,"We recently stayed for a night at the Riad Kalaa, and couldn't have been happier. The place was gorgeous with minimalist traditional and modern decor. We were sorry that we didn't reserve dinner because when we arrived the courtyard was beautifully set up for it. We also loved our room as it was a duplex, and perfect for our family of 4. It too was beautifully decorated, and quite comfortable. We also appreciated the large bathroom. The location was also good, although a bit tricky finding our way back after exploring the medina. It wasn't a problem, however, particularly because people were always helpful when we asked for help. Not least in our happy stay, was the excellent staff. They were so gracious and helpful during our too short stay. You can't go wrong with…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Such a delightful surprise at the end of the medina windy and dirt pathways,"This was a LOVELY hotel with wonderful staff, rooms and dinner. We also enjoyed our only wine while in Morocco there and found it quite good as well.Our room was lovely and thbath included a deep sunken tub as well as lovely accoutrements.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Beauty place,"We stay at Riad Kapaa for one night during our stay in Morocco. Our room was Moroccan in decor, and beautiful, ceilings about 20 feet high. Service was exceptional. We couldn’t ask for a nice taste of Morocco. Stay here!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Unexpected delight,"Situated not far into the medina in a side alley you step thru wooden door into unexpected delight. Decor is delightful a mix of old moroccan charm with modern accessories. Stayed in casablanca room, large light room with separated bedroom area by screen. Sitting room and lovely well appointed bathroom. Comfortable bed, heaps of hot water. Staff went out of their way to assist. Great meal. Definitely will stay here again. Lots to explore in Rabat.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2018,5,Beautiful Riad for or first night in Morocco,"Gorgeous, beautifully decorated Riad. A nice bedroom and beautiful bathroom. The linens and towels were very nice, soft and clean. The central open patio, the woodcarvings, gorgeous floor tiles, Moroccan lamps and decorations made the interior of the riad just stunning! It also had a rooftop with a small swimming pool and comfortable furniture were we had some aguardientes that night.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2018,3,Authentic feel but lacked comfort,"Situated more on the outside of the medina so access was easier than other riads I stayed in. The medina was clean, safe and decently lit. Your luggage will be carried in/out for you. This has a lovely feel to it and gave you a sense of ""authentic morocco"" but for me it was lacking in comfort and space. Also, be advised that for those that can't manage many stairs they are narrow and steep. The courtyard was lovely but the only place to sit other than in your room. We'd been warned that riads are dark, but a miner's lamp would be advisable! Bit difficult for me was taking my contact lenses out. (Yes - practical things matter to me as much as décor.) One of the few places in Morocco that I got a hot shower although I was irritated by the lack of space and furniture…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2018,5,Slightly off piste. But worth a visit,"Not the easiest of accommodation to find but our porter met us on the main road and walked us to the small door in a wall. On entering, it was all charm itself. The young happy and enthusiastic staff made our arrival easy and comfortable. Our room – Amber – on the first floor, was next door to the large with seating and loungers around it. The room itself was of adequate size with a comfortable bed with quality bedding and decent pillows. There was plenty of shelving and power points but the hanging space for clothes was a little short and limited if you had trousers, coats, etc. The free wi-fi was good in all areas, but we couldn’t get the TV to work – it didn’t matter to us, it was only a “test” but we’re certain if we’d asked the management it would have been resolved. …",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2018,5,Great Riad,"This is a beautiful little inn right in the Medina of Rabat. The room was comfortable and clean, the courtyard a very relaxing place to hang out, and the location perfect for exploring. We also ate dinner here and had a wonderful meal. Perfect for our first night in Morocco.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2018,4,Attractive Riad (Guest House) in the quiet middle of Rabat's medina,"Friendly, helpful staff. All the color and atmosphere of a traditional Moroccan riad with a nice restaurant in the courtyard with the requisite fountain and plants. Near the Rue de Consuls and several excellent restaurants.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2018,5,An amazing place and ten star service,Just visited this place yesterday and this place was beyond our expectations and the manager there Rane (or Raina) took care of us like it was her home and we were her most loving family. I don’t compromise on a hotel while traveling and I was not sure what to expect during our trip but this place provided a very authentic Moroccon experience. Highly recommended not just for the physical attributes of the place but also the personal attention and patience by the manager Rane( or Raina).,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2018,4,Nicely decorated riad in quiet locaton but small rooms.,"The Riad Kalaa is located in a quiet area of Rabat's medina near several good restaurants. It has a lovely courtyard with lush plantings (thus the designation ""Riad""). Despite the building being almost 200 years old, it has been lovingly restored and decorated. Unfortunately, our room, one of several ""1000 Parfums rooms"" was extremely small with very little storage space and barely enough room to open even one of our three suitcases. It was very nicely decorated in a modern, chic yet authentic manner. We checked in late afternoon and were greeted with mint tea and cookies. However, when we inquired about moving rooms the manager on duty was very disinterested in dealing with us and spoke very limited English. Service was otherwise adequate but minimal. The included breakfast…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2018,4,"Lovely hotel, find another restaurant",The hotel is beautiful and the staff couldn't be friendlier! We arrived in the morning and were welcomed with tea and sweets. Rooms are a nice blend of Moroccan and modern style. Nice dipping pool and area to dream away with a book and roof terrace. The restaurant however can be avoided. Prizes are relatively high for the food and service was horrible. Its a shame because improving this would make this nice experience into the perfect experience,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2018,4,Three day stay in Rabat at the Riad Kalaa,"This is a beautiful hotel! It is well situated and we spent three nights in total. The breakfast - continental - was fine, though I’d have preferred a friendlier waitress; ours was grumpy and provided a fairly grudging response to our request for more coffee... She clearly didn’t really want to be there. Overall, we enjoyed the room and the location particularly - within a hundred yards of our daughter’s riad.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2018,3,Nice but small room,Nice Riad with a good environment and nice staff. The room was quite small as well as the bathroom. It’s close from the important places in the city. It’s a good option but not so comfortable unless you can get a bigger room.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2018,5,We loved it,"We booked two rooms for our family. Gorgeous. One of the rooms was on the first floor so we were worried about noise. But by 9 pm it was quiet. All modern amenities and full of local charm. Double room on second floor was special. We stayed only one night, had breakfast and dinner. Both excellent. The reviews are true, stay here you will be happy.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2017,5,Rania was awesome!,We booked a room for my spouse and adult daughter. We were given a duplex room. With a queen bed and spacious bathroom on the top and two single beds on the bottom. The courtyard where dinner is served was right outside our room. so having dinner and walking 10 steps to your room was awesome. We were greeted at our car by Rania who was super friendly and went out of her way to help with all our requests. The room did have heating but was a tad too cold for us Miami residents so they provided a separate portable heater which worked well. The food at the riad was very good. The riad is in the old part of the city and like most of the riads in Morocco can not be accessed by car. Make sure your driver has instructions before hand on where to meet the hotel staff and they help you to…,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2017,4,A treasure of a place....,"I stayed 2 nights at Riad Kalaa and wished it could have been longer. The staff was very warm and welcoming, attentive to my needs, and very helpful to arrange for airport transfer and also a lovely hammam experience. The food was delicious, and they were quick to accommodate added guests for dinner on short notice. My room was off the main courtyard, and since it was not busy season, that didn't pose a problem. It might for light sleepers, but they have rooms upstairs which might take care of any sound issue. The second story included a nice rooftop terrace with a dipping pool... a very relaxing spot also protected from the winds. Would definitely stay here again. Be careful not to leave food in the room though, as I noticed some ants. In fact, they have a charming mural of…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2018,5,Astonishing,"We went into this place not knowing what to expect. You walk along a very ordinary little alley and knock on a fairly ordinary wooden door. Someone lets you in and shows you through a curtain, and then........then you are knocked out by what you see. It really does show that one has no idea what might exist behind ordinary doors. We just came to this place for dinner and were blown away by the place. The food was lovely, although my chicken pastille was incredibly dry. I would have sent it back but after my couple of mouthfuls, the friends all had to try it so it disappeared. The food was good, the wine was lovely, the ambience was fine and it was just a lovely evening. I don't know what it must be like to stay there as the rooms on the ground floor are situated around the…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2017,4,Good placwe to acclimate,"We arrived at lunch time and went straight to the riad. The people are terrific, warm and welcoming. After settling in to a lovely room on the ground floor, we headed out to explore. There is a lot within an easy walk so location is a winner. The dinner was okay, very typical tagine and salads. Breakfast the next morning was good and they don't water down the OJ, something that happens all over Morocco. This is a very comfortable homely riad and a good way to get introduced to the country",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2017,4,Great first night in Morocco,"What a pleasant surprise! We were welcomed by the friendly owners with a tea ceremony. The riad is exquisite with handcrafted doors,ceilings and pillars.The rooms are large an very clean. We were treated to a well prepared tagine supper and a super breakfast. Will go back any day.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2017,5,splendid,"As always, it's a pleasure to stay at the Riad Kalaa. As soon as you walk in, you feel welcome by the staff. The place is a peaceful heaven in the medina. The riad is beautifully decorated, and the unique rooms are equipped with all the amenities. I love to lounge by the pool. The breakfast is delicious and served with fresh produce. The location is great to explore the Rabat medina but is also walking distance to the modern center of town. Splendid overall.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2017,3,Our last riad in Morocco and not as good as others we stayed in!,"The riad is an easy walk from the parking area but not well sign posted. It has a nice central courtyard where one had breakfast and dinner. We were in the 1000 Parfumes double rooms which are good as they overlook the roof/pool area so have exterior light. The downstairs rooms open to the central courtyard and could be noisy at mealtimes. The room itself is fine. However only a curtain separates the room from the bathroom, so not very private if one is sharing with a friend. The food at dinner was just OK. And the service was extremely slow. At breakfast we found that they do not have tables for the number of guests. We had to wait and then when seated had to wait a long time for the table to be cleared/cleaned. Again service was slow. It was quite expensive compared to others…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2017,5,Excellent,We felt so welcome! Aicha at the reception is the most warm friendly and amazing person. The riad is beautiful with an exceptional ambiance and location. It also ground floor rooms for those who find it difficult to climb stairs. The breakfast was authentic and fresh. We loved the place and would recommend it to anybody visiting Rabat.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Delicious,Riad Kalaa is an oasis of true Maroc in the middle of the Rabat medina. The place is wonderful and the courtesy is nice and genuine. I had the opportunity to try the breakfast and it was delicious anf typical. Very good!!!,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Exotic Charm,"My husband and I had only one night in Rabat and we were delighted after nearly 24 hours of travel to find ourselves in the Riad Kalaa. The overall ambience is exotic charm, with cozy seating arrangements in the public areas, lovely potted plants and, most especially, the stunning tilework and the doorways that hint at more pleasures around the corner. Our room was absolutely charming with a narrow curved stairwell to the balcony bedroom, and the bathroom was spa quality. The staff were like magicians... we hardly knew they were there but everything was provided almost before we knew we wanted or needed it. The Riad was our first experience of traditional Moroccan cooking (dinner and breakfast) and we enjoyed one of the best meals of our trip right there in the courtyard. Ahhh...",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Very Nice Riad,"Stayed at this Riad for one night the first day I arrived in Morocco, which was a holiday Eid al-Adha, most all restaurants were closed and fortunately for me the Riad prepared dinner. The rooms were well equipped and comfortable, with complimentary wifi and breakfast. I would definitely recommend",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Start of our Moroccan adventure.,"Our room was lovely, staff spoke good English. Food very good. Very close to everything. Only here for one night on the beginning of our trip around Morocco. If all other accommodation is like this, everything will be great.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2017,5,Beautiful Riad,"My family of 5 stayed here for one night upon our arrival in Morocco. The Riad was beautiful, our two rooms looked like something out of an interior design magazine and the food was delicious. We were so tired, my husband and I did not even venture to the pool, but my daughters did and were very impressed.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2017,5,enchanted place,"Back in time with this amazing architecture. The riad is situated in the heart of the medina. You can wonder in the souk or other sites by foot, all within walking distance. The service is impeccable. Breakfast is cooked daily with a variety of french or moroccan pastry. They also offer dinner & light lunches or you can order from other places. The room is clean all in good order and of course there is air conditioning. I will definitely come back to this amazing welcomed place.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2017,4,Nice Stay,"We stay in this Riad for 4 nights and we really our time. If finding the place first was a bit challenging it was then nice to be in the Medina and be able to do everything just by walking. We enjoy the restaurant, the swimming pool. Everything was there to spend good time. Indicating very good as the bed was really hard but some people will prefer this than a soft one. Will certainly go back there one day",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2017,4,Wonderful welcome to Morocco,Our biggest concern after staying at Riad Kalaa on our first night in Morocco was how we were possibly going to stay anywhere nicer. We were worried that we had peaked on our first night. This is a truly beautifully appointed traditional riad. The attention to decorating details was exquisite. We were truly blown away by how lovely this place was. It was just how we had imagined Morocco might be -wandering down laneways until a treasure was revealed behind a large door. We stayed in the favorit room for just one night. It is a two storied room with a little living area downstairs and the bed and bathroom upstairs. I wish our stay had been longer if only to chill out in this riad. The cute quirky bathroom had a great shower and large fluffy towels. Good wifi and a very nice…,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2017,5,Excellent Riad with welcoming staff,"We received a wonderfully warm welcome upon arrival. The owner, David, and his staff have been very accommodating. The riad is in a perfect location for exploring Rabat and our meals have been excellent!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2017,4,Lovely place for dinner in traditional Riad,"Went here in July. Found it via TripAdvisor. Place was easy to find and had great hosts. The restaurant is absolutely stunning, the restaurant is in the middle of the riad with open air roof. Also great advantage, the hosts are able to speak English.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2017,5,Wonderful Respite in Riad!,"We had the pleasure of staying at Riad Kalaa and could not have been happier. The facilities are beautifully appointed, including the rooms. The roof top pool and sounding areas are superb. The staff are warm and welcoming. It's perfectly located in good walking distance of the city. Overall, fabulous time there and looking forward to returning again. David and his team are excellent!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2017,5,RiadKalaa 2,"Riad Kalaa 2 had a very cool vibe and welcoming employees- especially Amine and Zineb. The rooms were spotless and the food was absolutely delightful. Super clean and super trendy! I highly recommend staying here, whether it is with your family, by yourself or your partner. Not too crowded and very quiet during the evening, which is definitely a necessity in a city as loud and energetic as Rabat. It was a little bit of paradise in a city of chaos!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2017,4,Stopover,"Riad Kalaa is not easy to find, We stayed there overnight. I find the riad to be a beautiful and relaxing place. There were fruits and water bottles waiting for us in the room. The wifi was good, AC was ok. Breakfast was served on time. If I could find the riad on my own, I may consider staying there again.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2016,5,Sets a high bar for all Morocco Riads,"Riad Kalaa is a very well run, hidden gem and the first stop on our trip in Morocco. While it's not easy to find, once you enter the Riad, you're entering a whole new world with excellent food and a great atmosphere.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2017,5,Beautiful Riad,"From the moment we stepped into the courtyard of this Riad, we knew we made the right decision. The place was very relaxing and beautiful. The staff were very helpful and kind. The room was a bit small for 3 of us (Sultan) but it was very clean and nicely done. We had fruits and water waiting for us in the room when we arrived. It also had AC which was a must. On First night we actually ate dinner at the Riad which was the best food that we had in Morocco. The breakfast was amazing with fresh squeezed OJ, delicious jams and special Moroccan pancakes and bread. I am not sure if it was because of being there during the low season, but every time we had to take a shower, we had to ask to turn on the water heater 5 min prior. It wasn't a problem at all but the first time we didn't…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2017,5,One of the Finest Riads we stayed in,We had a wonderful stay in Riad Kalaa; the interior was classy and gorgeous and we also really enjoyed a delicious dinner and breakfast here. We really enjoyed our room and the hospitality; I'd really recommend staying a night or two here!,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2017,5,Pleasant night in the Medina,"Our family spent one evening at Riad Kalaa and enjoyed the stay. Our rooms were very spacious and there is a lot of attention to small details here. We all liked the blend of antique touches with modern amenities. We were told by the manager that we should consider having dinner at the Riad as restaurants may not be open during Ramadan. After a long day of traveling we enjoyed time at the pool and then the rain showers in the bathrooms. Fresh fruit and cool drinks were complimentary, as was the traditional breakfast. It would have been great to have had the option of an egg at breakfast, but we really enjoyed the baked goods provided. Dinner was delicious, but could have been a bit larger for the cost. We had fun venturing out after dinner to find a small bakery for local…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2017,5,Don't judge a book by its cover,"From the outside this riad certainly leaves a lot to be desired. In an alleyway of sorts one is filled with curiosity and fear of what to do expect. Yet once you enter it is arguably one of the smartest places I've ever visited.the architecture and decor are stunning. The rooms, while not offering any views are breathtaking in their own right. It is without a doubt one of the smartest rooms I've ever seen in my life. The staff being helpful and accommodating and kind also add to this magnificent place. A must stay !",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2017,3,Ran out of hot water in the middle of the night,"This is a lovely Riad and our two night stay could have been a wonderful experience if it weren't for the lack of hot water when attempting to take a shower in the middle of the night. When we notified the night staff on duty, they mentioned the primary tank was exhausted and needed to turn on the secondary tank. Asked us to wait 5 - 10 minutes for the hot water to be available; the hot water wasn't available even 2 hours later! We were at Rabat in April and it gets quite chilly at night. We resorted to using kitchen's hot water boiler and a bucket and to complete the shower! This is not something you'd expect from a 4 star Riad. Hopefully the hotel will address the issue with their hot water system as the Riad is beautiful and their restaurant serves great food.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2017,5,Very nice one night stay,"We stayed in this Riad in Rabat for our first night after flying into Casablanca. The hotel arranged a wonderful driver who met us at the terminal exit and drove us to the Riad. The Riad is ideally located in the Medina, only a few blocks from the car road. We were served mint tea and cookies upon arrival. The Etoilee Suite on the first floor was very spacious and romantic, with a separate sitting area. I believe it was the most expensive suite in the Riad. There is only a fabric drapery curtain separating the bathroom and the bedroom area. The shower is large but the sink and toilet areas are a bit small. Wish the room was brighter but this seems to be a problem in all the riads in Morocco. We ate the prix fixe dinner here. A bit pricey at 300 dhs. per person by a…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2017,5,Dreamy Riad,"This is the first Riad my friend and I stayed in as part of a tour we did with Around Morocco Tours. From the moment we walked in I was in love with the style and serenity. The rooftop terrace and plunge pool were a highlight after a long day. It's ""the stuff dreams are made of...""",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2017,5,Enjoyed our stay.,"We recently spent one night here, and enjoyed it. Our two rooms were gorgeous; in particular the the accent lighting that changed color on demand, and the whirlpool tub. Couple that with a friendly staff and good breakfast - what's not to love?",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2017,4,Comfortable Stay in Rabat,"While on holiday, me and my wife stayed at the Riad Kalaa. The Riad is ideally located for a tourist. We found the Riad very comfortable in terms of its facilities. More importantly, the friendly and welcoming staff made our stay memorable. The food too was very good. Overall, great value for money.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2017,4,Relax and let go... at massage,My mother and I enjoyed a most relaxing week at the Riad Kalaa! Breakfast was a treat every morning: a special mention to the wonderful breakfast lady;-) A very kind and helpful staff made us feel more than welcome. The courtyard is magnificent and truly enchanting in the evening. Make sure to have dinner at the Riad Kalaa and pre-order the stuffes fish before 10 a.m. Our first trip to Marocco couldn't have been better!,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2017,4,Friendly and central in the old medina,"Lovely, clean hotel with nice rooms facing a central courtyard. Top floors have external windows. Perfume rooms are the smaller top floor rooms. Nice rooms in different color schemes, with private bathrooms, TV, wifi, double beds. Beds are a bit hard, but this seems to be the rule in Morocco. Breakfast served in courtyard, coffee/tea, pancakes, jams and honey, cheese, croissants, dried fruits. Small swimming pool on top floor and a seating area. Short walk to restaurants, but they also have an in-house restaurant that we did not try. Friendly and flexible service, dependable car service.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2017,4,Charming Riad lacking in customer service,"We enjoyed our night here -- our suite was clean, modernized, and quite comfortable, the location is excellent, and our dinner, though expensive, was quite good. What's missing is customer service. We were barely greeted upon check-in, and our bags were not brought up to our room. We had to seek out a staff member for questions, and at no point did a staff member approach us to see how we were faring.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2017,5,Great place to start our Moroccan vacation,As part of a tour with Morocco Expert Tours we spent our first night at Riad Kalaa. We had researched it before the trip but we're really happy it exceeded our expectations. Our hostess greeted us with a warm welcome and traditional mint tea. This was our first experience with a Riad and we just loved the center atrium. Our room was modern with high ceilings and had a great soaking tub that my wife loved. The king bed was very comfortable and the room was so quiet and dark that we woke up late the next day. Very relaxing. We had dinner and breakfast there and the food/presentation were excellent. Not formal and very comfortable. We will be staying in a few other Riads on our trip but if they're like this one then we will have a great vacation.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2017,5,An amazing riad in Rabat,"Enjoy both convenience and comfort with a stay at Riad Kalaa, an idyllic accommodation combining modern-day luxury with traditional Moroccan culture. The location is great, right near Consuls street and the Kasbah of the Oudayas in Rabat, making it easy to access everything the city has to offer. Upon arrival, I was immediately taken by the majestic Moroccan charm of the riad. It has absolutely beautiful interiors, with clean, natural colors and plenty of foliage and greenery to brighten the place and make it feel alive. I was greeted as soon as I entered, and the entire staff was friendly and welcoming form the moment I arrived. I checked into one of the 1000 perfume rooms, each aptly named after a fragrance of Jasmine, Amber, Musk, or Sandalwood. The rooms are located on…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2017,4,Nice place to begin our adventure,"Riad Kalaa was the first of several riads that we stayed in during our trip to Morocco. It was a little smaller than some of the others, but did not lack in charm. The courtyard was beautiful and the rooms were very traditional looking. Ours was located on the second floor where there is a pool and terraces. Breakfast was very good with an assortment of breads and jams and fruit. The riad is in a great location right in the medina. We walked through the medina in the evening. There was a lot of activity and we felt very safe. It is not like Fes or Marrakech, there were more locals just hanging out and eating. It wasn't very touristy from what I saw.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2016,2,Looks are very skin deep,"Riad Kalaa looks good when you first arrive. While its bones are traditional, the makeover is very funky. Great colour schemes and interesting furniture. It started well but went down hill quickly. Service is at best chaotic. No one appears to be in charge. The two most obvious candidates appeared to be arguing quite a bit of the time. The staff appeared busy but there was little focus to the activity. At one point I had to almost pounce on the restaurant staff to get their attention and make sure they did not leave until they had taken our order, fearing we would not see them for another 30 minutes. The rooms look good but have many failings - effectively no lighting, so unless you have a kindle or ipad you will not be reading in bed! Very average toiletries and the toilet…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2017,2,Good place to stay but bad service,"We stayed for 2 nights me and my wife. The Hotel location is nice only 4-5 min walk from the medina parking spot. But, bad service we asked for room service they hand us the food and told me to take it to the room. All of a sudden our TV cable stopped went down to complain and they came saw it's not working and left telling me that they will be back. I was waiting for a long time till I gave up. Apart from the services of the staff the Ryad is in a good location. If you don't care about the service it's a nice place to stay with good rooms for couples only.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2017,5,Precious,"After wandering along the small maze like streets, & you arrive at your doorway, & are wowed. The courtyard & rooms are spectacular & quite a surprise. The staff is outstanding. Mustafa was our Tom Cruse! Just remember to not hit the main switch off if you're sharing a room!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2016,4,Good hotel but could be improved,"We stayed two nights at Riad Kalaa in December. The location of this riad is excellent. It is a cheap (around 10dh) ride from the train station. And you can easily walk to many attractions like the Oudaya Kasbah and Andalusian garden. Chellah and the Hassan II/Mohamed V monuments are not too far away. As the political center, Rabat is extremely clean and orderly, which probably leaves the best impression among all the cities we visited in Morocco. The rooms are nicely decorated, however when we entered it, there were 5 or 6 flies inside, which certainly left a bad first impression. Moreover if you happen to have a noisy neighbor, you may suffer from insomnia, since you can easily hear everything going on in this riad. The terrace is quite nice though. Regarding the service,…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2016,4,Very nice stay in the heart of Rabat,Our family of 5 spent a very nice couple of nights at Riad Kalaa. The rooms have a lot of charm and nice bathrooms. The food was good and the staff friendly. The location is perfect if you like walking round to explore the medina and the rest of the city.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2016,4,Lovely stay and first night in Morocco,"My wife, two kids (10 and 12) and I spent one night there after a long commute from SA. Riad Kalaa was a lovely place set in the old Medina, very close to the markets and eating places. The hosts were very friendly and service was very good. Positives were: - Good communication with Riad and parking was easy to find and convenient - Rooms were very beautiful - Breakfast was awesome On the negative: - Room are on the small side with little space to move but perfect for a night stay over - There was no hot water when we arrived but was rectified later than afternoon Overall was a very comfortable and enjoyable stay.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2016,4,Very comfortable in a good position,"This is well located in the medina - a very easy walk to the souk & Kasbah. The 2 rooms our family had (chambres berbiere and courtesan) were very comfortable but not overly spacious - on the ground floor they were adjacent to the restaurant so breakfast & dinner created a few noise issues. Rooms on the upper level would be preferred but there is no lift! There is a very pleasant terrace on the roof with a pool, very comfortable outdoor furniture & drinks can be served there. Dinner in the Riad restaurant - samosas, chicken & beef tagines & some pleasant Moroccan wines was both enjoyable & reasonably priced. Breakfast was typical Moroccan fare with some excellent breads, preserves & coffee. A good choice to stay in Rabat",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2016,2,A Disappointment,"This riad failed to achieve the standards one expected, in my opinion. The bed was uncomfortable and I suspect was the source of a number of bites we received. Staff had to be reminded to provide basic amenities like fresh towels and pillows. Breakfast was disrupted by multiple bees/wasps feeding on the uncovered jams. The room had to be prepared after our aarival in the late afternoon!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2016,4,A Great Place to Be - On Rue Zebdi,"A lovely riad only two minutes walk from the Boulevard Laalou entrance to the medina. We stayed for 3 nights at the start of our week in Morocco and then one final night in a different room. Each room was comfortable and slightly unique, with its own charms and quirks. The bedrooms of the 1000 perfums rooms aren't huge, so we took up a fair bit of room with our two admittedly overly large suitcases. The courtyard, terrace and balcony areas are really attractive. We looked forward to breakfast each morning - fruit salad, yoghurt, breads and jams, cake. A good start to the day. The riad really felt like a homely place to come back to after a day of bustling around the city, with all the staff being friendly and welcoming. Excellent wifi too. We were definitely pleased with our…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Very beautiful!,"This hotel is GORGEOUS! It's a great location in the Medina. Our room was so nice! It even had a fireplace! Each and every detail of the room was intricate with tile work - I mean, wow! The room was comfortable as well. I would recommend you stay upstairs. If you stay downstairs, you're very close to where breakfast occurs (if you're like me and like your space).",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2016,5,Can do attitude,"iad Kalaa is a top place to stay. If you're driving there then make sure you understand where to park, as it can be quite confusing. The parking is a few minutes' walk from the Riad (through a little backstreet alleyway maze). Professional staff that generally understand English (though prefer French). Rooms very comfortable. They were very in tune with our childcare requirements and most helpful to our requests (palpable can-do attitude). Embarrassingly we were the loudest group (with our kid) and there is definitely a potential for thin walls / living near others to influence the peace especially at night / in the morning. Maybe bring some ear plugs in case there's a noisy group? Dinner at the restaurant was superb too (not cheap but very tasty). Rooftop view is very tranquil…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Good experience staying in a traditional Moroccan Riad,"Salam I was staying at this Riad which is a traditional of Moroccan style it was good experience, comfortable, good breakfast. The only thing the entrance of the Riad you need to walk a little from St to reach it. all the staffs were very kind and I would thanks miss Aisha.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2016,4,Nice riad,I like very nice staff so hopeful room was clean food good and fresh good riad location is good too close to bazzar I will recommend it nice room and bathroom and quite too had tras roof good for relaxing and area around pool for have good time and reading,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2016,4,a good riad to start to feel Moroco,"Good location, good staff, very attentive to the needs of the customer. A little old fashion but enough for one night and spend the rest of the time visiting the town, mausoleum, medina and then move to another city.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2016,3,Not as good as we thought,"The Riad is located in the Medina and is not accessible by car. On arrival we had problems to find someone who could help us with our luggage from the parking area to the Riad (app 8 minutes walking distance). At departure nobody helped us. Our room was not ready when we arrived in the late afternoon. The room was nicely decorated but a bit dark and smelt moldy. The bathroom had shown some signs of mold as well around the shower. If you opened the window or door you would loose your privacy because all the rooms on the ground floor are facing the courtyard where dinner and breakfast is served (tables 2 m away). Food was very good, atmosphere nice. The background music (Swing and R&B - why not Moroccan music?) was too loud. When we had finished dinner we tried to find some…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Great value for your money,"Pretty, clean, unpretentious and reliable, great location. Friendly service - decent rooms - a bit small but very pretty and good bathrooms Lovely courtyard. Courteous and helpful, No nonsense place. I recommend it, and would return!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2016,5,Mystical Sanctuary,"Rabat is a vibrant and exotic city teeming with life. The city is a joy to experience but our stay at Kalaa made it all the more special. Easily accessible near the edge of the medina, and strategically placed near some of the cities best attractions, Kalaa was the ultimate place to have our base as we explored the city on our honeymoon. The food and service were outstanding. In fact the food was the best we had during our entire stay. The elaborate complimentary breakfast was immaculate. I'm picky about my coffee and it was consistently perfect (the tea was great as well). The inner courtyard was a peaceful respite from the buzzing city, and the rooftop area with pool was especially rejuvenating. The staff and service was friendly and prompt, they went above and beyond for us.…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2016,4,A charming and soothing stay,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in late September on holiday. Overall, Riad Kalaa is a real oasis, and splendidly placed in the medina of Rabat. We had made an early reservation, and were very pleased to get a two-storie suite with the door opening right to the ground level base of the riad. The combined bathroom/dressing room was lovely on the afternoon returns from trekking in town. This small boutique hotel is mainly run by a team of charming women who are in every way very professional in carrying out their work. Since the hotel is in the medina, there is no access by car and the surroundings are calm and friendly. The French/Moroccan type of breakfast served every day on the riad center was definately the delight of our stay in the country. The location is…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2016,5,Fantastic Hotel & resturant,"Wow, what an incredible authentic beautiful hotel. The entranceway when you come in is and than entering into the main area is just so beautiful it is hard to describe. Friendly people working here. On the top floor they have an open area with chairs and tables, very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place. My girlfriend is still talking about how great the included breakfast was.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2016,5,Charming and perfectly appointed modern bed and breakfast in the heart of the old medina,"My daughter and I spent two nights in Rabat at this exquisite riad. Our room, the Starry Suite, was spacious and at the top of the stairs, we had easy access to a lovely roof deck and sitting room. The breakfast that was included In our stay was not only bountiful and delicious, but beautifully presented in a lovely dining area. The staff was consistently pleasant and accommodating and very easy to work with. In short, we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2016,5,Beautiful riad and great location.,"We stayed for one night only. We had dinner and it was delicious despite being a little pricey. It was supposed to be three course meal , the starter was a selection of Moroccan salads that were very good. Main very good too and big portion. Dessert though as advertised was watermelon. Good, but I thought we would have some sweets. The room was excellent. On the top floor near the pool. Place is quiet and the location is perfect for exploring Rabat. Breakfast in the morning was delicious. I would like to go back next time.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2016,5,Spectacular boutique hotel in the heart of the old medina of Rabat,"From the moment we entered this historic building in the old, walled medina of Rabat we were mesmerized. From the serene central courtyard where breakfast and traditional Moroccan dinners are served, to the soaring carved wooden ceilings and ancient doors, everything about this exquisitely renovated 1815 Riad spoke of history, tradition and warm hospitality. Even the classic Arabic music playing in the background transported us to a different time and place. We had a delightful, relaxing dinner and wine in the courtyard and slept luxuriously in a room fit for a sultan and sultana. Magnificent!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2016,5,A wonderful riad in the perfect medina location,"Our two nights here at the Riad Kalaa were our first in Morocco, and it was a wonderful welcome to the city of Rabat and the country overall. The riad is peaceful and elegant; our room was truly beautiful and so comfortable. There are nice touches all around; no detail is too small to have great care given. Morning breakfast on the terrace was one of the best we had in Morocco, and an afternoon swim in the beautiful little pool was so welcome after walking the city. Highly recommend!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2016,4,A Perfect Place for Exploring Rabat,"This small boutique hotel proved to be a relaxing and well-situated place for our one day, one night visit in Rabat. The riad is tastefully furnished, with a lovely central courtyard open to the sky. There is a also a roof deck with a small pool and the enchanting sound of flowing water. Our room was quiet, clean, and the bedding was quite comfortable. We had a well-prepared dinner in the courtyard and an ample breakfast of Moroccan specialty pastries, fresh juice, honey, jam, coffee/tea. The manager was friendly and provided us with a useful plan and map for seeing the main sights of Rabat. This little boutique hotel is literally right across the street from the impressive Kasbah of the Oudayas, and just a few feet from the Rabat medina. It was also a reasonable walking…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Get down and get local,"What a great place to visit. The town was excellent, the motel in the centre of the town area made the visit all that much better. We were with the locals, shopping and dinning then just a nice walk to our excellent hotel. Up to date facilities, but who cares it was a great place.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2016,4,Riad Kalaa restaurant,My wife and I had booked 2 nights at Riad Kalaa however there was a leak found at 11pm in our room therefore we were sent to another Riad (named EUPHORIAD) of a higher standard 5 minutes away from Riad Kalaa at no extra cost. Thus this review is only dedicated to Riad Kalaa restaurant where we had twice a dinner twice and that we recommendas good value for money restaurant.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2016,4,Beautiful Riad good location,Our room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Service is good with friendly staff. We were to have dinner at the Riad however it is not available on Sunday. No alternative than to walk thru the medina..which was fine. Breakfast is basic but still adequate.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2016,2,Somewhat Disappointing,"We stayed here for just one night during a quick stop in Rabat and left pretty underwhelmed. The riad is nice looking from top to bottom with a courtyard / dining space and roof terrace with a small pool. The rooms are cozy and nicely decorated, but the reason we were disappointed was the service and attitude of the staff. The minute we arrived for check-in we felt like we were an imposition by staying here. We were gruffly asked if we were at the right riad (we were) and quickly checked in without any feeling of warmth we had felt at other riads in Morocco. We weren’t asked if we needed assistance with our luggage and had to reach out for access to the air conditioning unit. We were very relieved to be only staying here for one night when we realized that there was no hot…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2016,3,Others have said it: beautiful Riad but terrible service,"Five stars for the property itself. Gorgeous and comfy with a truly lovely pool and sun deck. We booked the highest class room available, the Starry Suite, and the architecture and details of the room were stunning. Sadly, one star for the service. We were already a little concerned because communication from the staff prior to arrival had been poor. And then from the moment we arrived, hurried staff treated us almost as an annoyance. After welcome tea and a very distracted check in we were forgotten by the staff. No one ever introduced themselves. There was no explanation of the property or the area. No mention of breakfast nor even where it would be served. Eventually we tracked someone down and were finally shown to our room. Only bright spot on service was the gentleman…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2016,4,Excellent riad in great location,"We were allocated a room on the ground floor, which was very tastefully decorated and furnished. The bathroom was very well equipped. The roof terrace has sun loungers and a small plunge pool which we took advantage of. The problem was that the courtyard is also the dining room and the noise level continued until 2345h outside the room which made it impossible to sleep. This was the only criticism about an otherwise perfect riad.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Great cultural experience,"The hotel was very cozy and clean I really liked the decoration of the rooms and the place in general, its very close to the market and to get there one have to walk through many alleys that give a sense of a big maze, it was awesome! internet connexion is good too.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Very cozy,"We unfortunately only stayed for one night in Rabat, and loved our little riad. The room was very comfortable (if a bit humid) and the courtyard was lovely for breakfast and relaxing. The staff were very helpful and gracious. My only regret is not having dinner on site, as we arrived late from Casblanca, the menu looked very good.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Outstanding boutique hotel,"Our family of four stayed at this outstanding place. We left the car at the gates and walked into the maze of little alleys and streets. The Kalaa has tastefully decorated rooms; newly renovated bathrooms and the kids just loved the rooftop pool, see our pic. The breakfast and food was really good and reception staff extremely helpful and very child friendly. We will come again.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Great experience,"Peaceful, authentic, lovely service and great location. Also an easy access: a 3 minutes walk from the entrance of the Medina of Rabat. Indications to Riad Kalaa on the walls of the Medina. Safe, also when coming back late after diner dowtown. A no brainer! I will be back for sure.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2016,5,Great atmosphere,My husband and I stayed at Riad Kalaa for only one night. We would have loved to have stayed longer. The Riad is situated in the medina. Walking down the alleyways of the medina you would not imagine the beautiful riad hidden behind the large wooden door. Originally a house the rooms are located around the central courtyard that also serves as the dining area. It is serene with palms and a fountain and is softly lit at night creating a very romantic atmosphere. The rooms are well appointed and attractively decorated in Moroccan style. We ate at the riad. Probably not the cheapest option but a good one. There is a roof top terrace with an attractive pool area. Wifi is free. Bottled water is complimentry and there was a friut bowl and biscuits in the room.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2015,5,charming and authentic Morrocan!,"We stayed, as a family of 5, for 3 nights last August. The riad was beautiful and very comfortable. The service, including recommendations of where to visit and where to eat spot on for our needs. Dinner in the riad's restaurant was as good as the best restaurant we visited in town. If we go back to Rabat, this is definitely where we'll go and stay.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2016,4,Cozy place in Rabat,This riad is inside the medina. We thought our guide was taking us to a wrong place then we realized the riad is hidden in the narrow streets. It was a nice surprise. The food was very delicious and our room was very cozy!,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2016,5,Great stay,"Very nice.. our driver was able to get a room right off the center court for the first night and then we were moved to the upstairs room which was also very nice.. comfortable beds, very clean. Breakfast was more than we could eat, eggs, yogurt, fruit, bread. We had dinner one night and the food was excellent. Service was also very good. Wine was not overly expensive. Would certainly return here. Very modern. They have a second location so be sure and ask for Kalaa 1.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2016,5,Wonderful,"First call !!! We were very well received, the manager gave us all the information about Rabat. All impeccable, breakfast and wonderful dinner. Close to important points to visit and very safe around. I recommend it to everyone. Wonderful experience",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2015,5,"Beautiful perfection on the Moroccan coastline, nestled just inside the Medina","Probably the perfect place to stay in all of Morocco. Spending three weeks travelling around this hidden gem is about as perfect as you can get. As you walk into the sunny courtyard you will enjoy a mint tea and be guided to your luxurious room. The staff are friendly and helpful, they can answer your questions and book guides and activities for you. The rooftop lounge and seating area has a few day beds and small pool to cool off. Cost wise it is not cheap but sometimes you deserve to spend a little extra on yourself. The staff arranged for a beautiful meal at a restaurant just around the corner, through a wooden door that you would walk past without realising. The food was amazing the restaurant was stunning and the staff came around and washed your hands with rose water. …",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2015,3,Definitely worth a second visit!,"Using traditional artwork and craftsmanship from all over Morocco -- Riad Kalaa did not fail to impress. From the soft hues of light emitted by its varied lamps, the oasis-like interior design of its central courtyard, the mystical bar area and stairway leading to its hammam / massage area... Riad Kalaa is definitely a sanctuary of peace and luxury for any weary adventurist / traveler in Rabat. If I find myself back in Rabat I would not think twice about going back to this place. Areas for improvement include on-site service (i.e., the lack of hotel-like service) during off-peak season, attention to cleanliness at the roof deck area (cushions were not laid out and tables were dirty perhaps because of the winter season), and minor maintenance work on rooms. An hour-long mix of…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2016,3,Slim pickings in Rabat?,"I found the place to be ok, but compared to places in Fez, not great. Was rated #2 in Rabat, maybe there are not better options? very friendly on checkin with tea, gave good maps, etc. Rooms clean but small. Some lack of privacy with just a curtain separating bathroom from sleeping area. Staff sometimes not in reception area and/or would not come when bell rung even if nearby. Pre-paying through website seemed to create confusion as bill on departure still charged for room, took some time to sort out. Hot water was out the first day. Eventually got re-started and was good. Spa was not in operation. Beautiful inner courtyard, but had flies swarming in center that made breakfast a little less appealing. The rooftop area was nice. Pretty well located. A mixed experience.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2016,4,Good place in Rabat's medina,"We stayed here two nights and had an overall good time. We had dinner at the Riad the first night and it was great. The Riad is well placed at the medina border, it is quite new and modern with a nice Moroccan touch. We had only one problem. As our departure was early in the morning we asked for a taxi and we were offered also a light early breakfast, but on the departure day neither breakfast not taxi were ready and nobody was to be found at the reception or anywhere else. Overall we warmly suggest the place even if it is not as personal and traditional as other Riads we visited.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2015,5,Like the set from Aladdin,"This riad is a mix of exotic with touches of hollywood - rooms decorated all in purple, bits of mural showing ants or odd faces along the walls. Each room is different and elegantly laid out (though sometimes quite small). The terrace is perfect for viewing sunrise or set and for enjoying a lovely pool (though it was very cold when we arrived). The main courtyard is a delight of Mughrab architecture and design with comfortable seating places and trees.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Super nice place with a good mix of old and modern,This is by far the best place you can stay in Rabat for the money. It is owned by the nicest people in the world and they are very professional. It has the most bad@$$ rooftop with a pool and lounge. My fiancee and I stayed here on our honeymoon and would go back in a heartbeat.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2015,4,Very special stay,"The Riad is amazingly beautiful. The owner did a great job renovating this historic place. The attention to details in craftsmanship is truly remarkable. Why not 5 stars? The service while was professional, it felt under staffed. We had to wait in uncertainty for everything. From checking in, waiting for dinner/breakfast to getting drinks by the bar. And the shower was not very warm.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2015,5,Warm Welcome To Morocco,My husband and I spent the first 2 nights of our Morocco journey at the Riad Kalaa. From the parking lot it was a few minute walk through a rather narrow street to the Riad which is well situated in the Medina. Walking through the streets you have absolutely no idea what awaits you behind the high walls. When the door opened we were magically transported to another time - our room faced an absolutely beautiful courtyard. The room was spacious and quite comfortable. As we arrived late we enjoyed a terrific dinner at the Riad in the 'magical' courtyard lit by candle-light. A lovely breakfast was also served in the courtyard. The food was quite good. If you are looking for a special place - this is definately an upscale Riad that we highly recommend.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2015,5,Oasis in the medina,"We stayed for two nights in Riad Kalaa. It is located in the medina, so you need to walk a few hundred meters through the narrow streets, which by the way are perfectly illuminated at night. When you press the doorbel, a large wooden door opens to give the access to this little gem. There is a large central courtyard, where you can sit for a drink, breakfast or diner. Our room opened directly onto the courtyard. The room was small, but comfartable, and just like the rest of the Riad well decorated. Bathroom also small, but a good walk-in rainshower. There is a small swimming pool on the rooftop, including comfortable seat. Breakfast was good, fresh juice, pancakes, muffins, bread, yoghurt. Every single stafmember was very friendly. They serve good diner, and there are a few…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2015,4,Comfortable,The Riad is easy to find in the Medina and has a beautiful courtyard area. The walls seem a bit thinner than others we've stayed at as the street noise was quite pronounced. The rooms are 2-storey with the bedroom upstairs creating a bit more heat with the bathroom there also. Very clean and comfortable.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2015,5,Magical Place,"My only regret about Riad Kalaa was the fact that my partner and I only stayed for one night - during my birthday holiday to Rabat. Arriving in the evening and being led into the beautiful courtyard restaurant area was for me a defining image of this enchanting hostelry - hidden behind those high Medina walls. The bedroom was simple and characterful, equipped with everything one might need for a comfortable and relaxing stay. In the following days morning sunshine, the courtyard was redefined as a bright and colourful oasis of peace, where one could just sit in the sun and sip coffee all day - whilst continually noticing some or other uniqueness in the surrounding lovingly restored architecture of the place. We have vowed to go to this place again, possibly in the late…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Beautiful retreat,"Although the rooms are a little small, they are beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable. The public rooms are beautiful. The service and especially the food, were excellent The food was the best of all the riads we stayed in with an extensive menu of choices. Breakfast was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our all too brief stay.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2015,3,"Dark, noisy and unpleasant","Riad Kalaa was the first Riad I had stayed in, and I found I was almost claustrophobic. The rooms are small and gave out onto the small central court, which was often busy and noisy. There are no outside-looking windows. The open air space is covered with plastic, which limits sun light into the Riad. There were few staff, who were busy with other matters. Making you feel at home was not a priority. The Riad did have good food, from an on-sight restaurant. While it offers a roof-top swimming pool, the pool was small and setting dreadful. Personally, having stayed in many other Riad during my Moroccan vacation, I would not go back.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2015,2,Very poor service,"If it wasn't for the service, this riad could be rated with 4 or 5 stars. We weren't greeted when we arrived, nor in the morning for breakfast. It was a very strange feeling. The riad is beautiful, with a nice courtyard, cute rooms and a great rooftop.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2015,5,Real treat for the eyes and body,"The most beautiful Riad (Moroccan patio) of all the three we visited during our stay in Morocco. Incredible use of light, plants, water and wood to give this place a striking noble and organic feel. The masterfully carved cedar doors, panels and furniture made you feel like royalty. The scent of the handcrafted body-wash products were an aromatherapy on its own. Breakfast was a true delight and staff was friendly although a bit shy. You will inevitably find the usual flaws of Moroccan riads here: 1- There is almost no sound isolation (meaning little privacy); 2 - Accessibility might be a problem since it is located in the narrow intricate alleys of an old neighborhood and cannot be reached by car. 3 - Minor quirks like doors that get jammed or are hard to lock. It was a great…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2015,5,Very Beautiful Riad,"Very beautiful large riad. Our room was beautiful, service was wonderful, breakfast was by far the best of the 8 hotels I stayed in while traveling around Morocco. We stayed on a Sunday, so we didn't get to eat dinner at the riad, the restaurant and spa are closed on Sundays. I imagine if we had dinner on the very lovely terrace, it would have been very good. I can definitely recommend staying at this lovely riad.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2015,4,Architecturally Striking But Imperfect,"We got upgraded to one of the ""Sultan"" rooms on the first floor. Considering the premium nature of the rooms, they suffer from a fatal flaw: there's very limited sound privacy from the lobby area, that they open onto, which also happens to be a restaurant. While the hotel is clearly conscious of this and tries to keep the noise level down, it was still a fairly bizarre experience to go about getting ready for bed, with a full restaurant next to you. The room was okay: extremely tall ceiling and luxury details but (typical for a riad) small square footage. And, an offbeat comment: the pillows were very hard. Overall, it's a well cared for and strikingly designed place to stay (there's a rooftop dipping pool, for example). But I would suggest opting for second level rooms which…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2015,5,6 over 5 stars!,"After a long and tiresome day in the busy, dusty narrow, time to time a little dirty but totally safe and magnificent streets of the Rabat Medina, getting into this beautifully decorated, sedate, wonderful court of the Riad Kalaa was one of our best little moments of surprise and intense happiness!. Beautifully decorated, the details of illumitation, ornemantation, wall pictures etc. were extraordinary. One of the best we have ever met. It was week-end and with a short notice our last minute request for a third bed in our room was ready when we arrived late evening. Our room at the lower floor, with 5m high ceilings, very comfortable bed, one of the best bathrooms that we have ever stayed, everything was perfect. Our only disappointment was as we stayed two days last month in a…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2015,5,Beautiful riad in old medina with excellent service,"I stayed here for a few nights after a yoga retreat in Marrakech. I stayed in one of the 1000 perms rooms, and it was perfect. I love that there was fresh fruit as well as water bottles in the room. The courtyard where breakfast and dinner is served is gorgeous. The breakfast was delicious with juice, coffee, tea, moroccan breads and crepes, fresh or dried fruits, and yogurt. Just five minutes from Kasbah des Oudayas, the ocean, and easily walkable to Hassan tower and Mohammad V mausoleum, the location was great for me. It is easy to find your way out of the walled streets once you know it is right, right and second left. They even got my train ticket for me! Really good stay.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2015,5,Sight for Sore Eyes,"After traveling for more than 24 hours to get to Morocco, do a little sightseeing in Casablanca and heading to Rabat, we were more than pleased with this beautiful place. Our room was gorgeous and very comfortable. Since we were so exhausted, we opted to dine-in at the Riad and are very glad we did. What a charming set up with tables throughout the courtyard yet everyone had their own space. It seems most of the guests had opted to dine it that night. The food was great and service was excellent. I would recommend this Riad to all.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2015,5,Beautiful riad in the heart of Rabat,"While we would have never found this plac e without our guide, this riad is wonderful. We were greeted and given tea while the staff finished getting our room ready. The room was on the second floor and yes, the stairs are narrow and tricky but it's am old building. The room was simple and small but that's what we expected. There's no door to the bathroom, just a curtain. But you can't beat the decor and hospitality.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2015,5,A Beautiful Place Inside the Medina,"I only spent one night here but was very impressed. The riad is in the Medina and its beauty came as a surprise after the trek through narrow featureless streets. It was my first night in Morocco and I was not prepared for the lovely interior. It is a classic riad but has been handsomely renovated with a slightly modern feel and is clean and well maintained. My room opened from the ground floor through a carved wooden door. Inside was a sitting area with a traditional couch and up a spiral staircase, a comfortable bedroom and large bath. As another review said, the bath is not separated from the bedroom by a solid door. It is a lovely space however and was nicely stocked with toiletries (which I never use). I had a delicious dinner, choosing a fish tagline from a number of…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2015,5,"Lovely riad, great food","Riad Kalaa was a perfect hotel to begin our trip through Morocco. The property is beautiful, location in the ""heart"" of the city, staff lovely and accommodating, and food excellent. It set the bar high for the rest of our travels in Morocco!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Morocco for beginners - in a great style,"Riad Kalaa staff will pick you up from the airport for 20 Euros. This way you can avoid negotiations with taxi drivers in Rabat. After a 20 min drive, you will come to Medina, and be amazed. The Riad is situated in a calm, clean and beutiful part of Medina. It is close to the market, restaurants, bars and all that charming chaos. But not too close- the neighbourhood is quite and calm. Within a few minutes, you can also reach Rabat Kasbah. The Riad itself is a pure joy: great breakfast, great dinner, great staff (speak English, French and German), stable and fast internet. Massages and hammam are offered for available prices (we paid 30 Euros for 1 hour massage, 45 for half an hour of hammam and one hour of massage). Highly recommended!!! AAfter a good massage, enjoy sun on the…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Gorgeous small hotel,"We had only one night at Riad Kalaa, but were impressed with the beauty of this intimate boutique hotel. The courtyard is stunning in tile and carved wood and plaster. Fabulous breakfast (the best we had in Morocco) in a small dining room off the courtyard. Rooms are lovely, not terribly roomy, with luxurious, beautiful bath. Ours did not have a window except to the courtyard (a tiny bit noisy and less than private--not unusual in old riads). The spa area and bar were beautiful--wish we could have stayed longer.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2015,5,The best boutique Riad in Rabat,"This is now the 5th time that I have stayed in Riad Kalaa and the service, standards, rooms, food and atmosphere remains impeccable. There is a charm that no other Riad in Rabat has. The Medina in Rabat is already a great place to be but to have a hidden gem like Riad Kalaa makes the Capital even more special.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2015,5,"Continental Luxury, Moroccan Style: a Gem","All of the amenities you'd expect at a European boutique hotel with all of the Moroccan character and charm intact. You must try the massage/hammam combination, and breakfast is a delight. Enjoy the sunset with a bottle of fabby Moroccan rose and bowl of olives dressed with spices and preserved lemons. The riad's staff is also extremely friendly and helpful, and it's located in the heart of Rabat's medina. Wish I could have stayed here longer!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2015,5,An Excellent Riad,"Great location in the medina but a quiet retreat. Stunningly beautiful traditional Moroccan decor. Our room was very comfortable with a spacious, well-appointed bathroom. Spacious communal area. Staff were attentive and professional. Excellent breakfast.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2015,4,Fabulous individual bedrooms,"A stunning boutique hotel to stay, with great food for breakfast & evening meal - we could not fault this hotel. Only one slight thing was that there was no hot water to have a shower late afternoon when we arrived but it was fine by the morning.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2015,5,Love the Riad Kalaa,"This was one of my favorite places ever, and in Morocco where we started many wonderful places this Riad stands out above the rest. Every detail is exquisite and no two rooms were the same. The linens, the glassware, the snacks in the room, the breakfast every detail has been thought of to make your stay the best possible experience. My only complaint is that we didn't stay longer and we hardly had time to take full advantage of the ambiance and amenities. I would love to come back and never leave the Riad. The staff was very accommodating and helpful, the food was delicious! I can't say enough good things about this Riad!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2015,4,very cool road,"yes, this place is difficult to find, and its the only one of the three roads that actually does have a sign on it. But if you're lucky enough to find it you're in for a real treat.IT is magical inside but it does have some rustic elements-after all, you are in the medina. I enjoyed the hamman experience which is a great value for those not wanting to try the public hamman, My daughter had a mani pedi and that worked out well too. The staff is extremely accommodating We did not eat dinner here. I would definitely go back.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2015,2,Disappointing,Followed the directions provided by our travel agency but difficult to find in the medina with no signs that we could see to find this riad. Eventually asked some locals who came to our rescue and took us to the riad. We were given a small dark room with no TV. The second room we were shown was bigger and had steps up to the bedroom and bathroom. Not the best alternative for my husband who has a disability but at least the room had a TV (which didn't work) and wasn't as gloomy. The staff were French and not helpful. We had dinner that night in the riad and it was nice but expensive. The breakfast was worth waiting for and was excellent. The weather in Rabat was horrible (torrential rain and cold) which may have influenced our opinion of this hotel.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2015,5,A Stunning Stay.,"I was really impressed with this Riad. The staff were all very kind to their guests, which is always appreciated. The Riad was easy to get to, incredibly clean, and had all the amenities one could hope for (and then some). And the surrounding area was very comforting for a first-time traveler. I'll make it a point to stay here next time about.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2015,5,Excellent,"Whole ambiance excellent - location, staff friendliness, including pick up from railway station ( get the raid to collect you as you may not find it first time in the dark! OK after a few trips in and out!) Courtesy of the waiting staff, cleaners etc.. Cleanliness. Food.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2015,5,Nice nice,"Very lovely staff (and good looking) not most easy to find but it was worth it, good breakfast at the rooftop. Flexible check inn, we came 23.20 and no probs. Good wifi connection, faster than spain😃 we had great time, slept well, maybe my biggest hotel ever. recommend for everyone.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2015,4,Beautiful,"Kalaa is a very very nice riad. It's very well located, easy to reach, clean and with beautiful decor. The roam we got was a two story room, very spacious and comfortable. The staff was quite nice too. The products available in the bathroom have been the best I've had in years. The things I didn't like where that the spa and the restaurant were both closed.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2015,5,Great experience,"Had a really nice time here- super easy to find in the medina (which is NOT always easy!), beautiful building and rooms, very clean, and kind, friendly staff. Close to shopping area and local landmarks.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2015,5,The biggest bedroom door I've ever seen!,"Don't let the forbidding wooden door in a windowless wall put you off. This place is a hidden treasure. We were greeted with mint tea in the beautiful courtyard. We had the Berbere room which led straight off the courtyard through a huge double height wooden door. This lovely warm room was the epitome of Moroccan architecture and décor. I smiled the whole time I was there! Food is very good, too and the staff are very friendly and helpful. We stayed in 8 hotels in different cities on a tour of Morocco and Riad Kalaa is definitely our favourite.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2015,5,A fabulous place to relax in the Medina of Rabat,"Stayed at the Riad Kalaa for 5 nights at the end of Feb. 2015. We were overwhelmed by the kindness and attention of the staff, Aicha & Laetitia. Nothing was too much trouble, delicious food, very comfortable room, a great place.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2015,4,Nice room but small,"Stayed just the one night, and it can be hard to judge a place when you arrive late and leave early. The riad is well located in the old medina and appeared to have a French influence. Our room was up at roof level near the pool. A small room but nicely presented. Bathroom was reasonable,but hot water was scarce for the morning shower.( no rain shower as per Manhatzi review for us!) Also not too keen on just a curtain separating the bathroom from the small bedroom. There is a certain lack of privacy involved, if you know what I mean.! Breakfast was typical Moroccan, breads and spreads, but nicely done. The three shot glasses of different fresh juices, a nice touch. Help yourself jugs of hot coffee was a welcome change.The central courtyard was nicely presented and looked…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2015,5,Peace,"Though it took me a bit to find the Riad Kalaa, as soon as I stepped over the threshold I felt as if I had been whisked away to a desolate paradise. From our introduction the staff was friendly, hospitable, and made me feel like this was my home. I stayed in the sultan suite and fell in love with the lofted bed/bathroom; the bathroom is particularly roomy and allowed me to relax is a stepped into the rain shower. Breakfast was an absolute treat; each morning I knew I'd be starting out my day rate. The rooftop terrace was beautiful: it was too cold for me to sit up there but I would love to return in the summer to spend the day in the pool. The main courtyard was my favourite part of the place; I would love just going out there to sit and relax. Lastly, the staff went out of…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2015,5,very nice place,"Been to Kalaa 2 (Kalaa extension) in Feb 2015 and overall: - super friendly staff (special mention to Mehdi, he is so nice and helpful) - breakfast is really delicious - warm welcome from everybody (thx Iman for the tourist hints, even if I did not have time to visit), you really feel at home! - rooms are very nicely decorated, not super big but very nice - super quiet (so is the Medina at night I believe...)",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2015,4,Hidden Treasure,We have just spent two magnificent nights at the Riad Kalaa. Having not been to Morocco before we could not have asked for a better welcome. The staff were incredibly courteous and helpful navigating us around the town and the region. The Riad was bright and inviting and a delicious Moroccan tea and biscuits were provided on arrival. The room was located on the roof terrace with distant views and noises from the city. The breakfast was fresh and healthy and a great way to start the day. We also had dinner their on one night and it was just delicious.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2014,5,"Beautiful, gracious home-like feeling","From the elegant rooms, to the rooftop pool and lounging area, this old home is a wonderful place to visit. Nestled inside the medina's maze of alleys, it is quiet and peaceful. Be aware that the doors to many rooms are stained glass and quite transparent though!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2014,3,Christmas in Rabat,"This is a beautiful and peaceful riad in Rabat. Stayed in the 1000 Parfums Double Room. The staff is young and multilingual. Aiyisha was very helpful. I arrived late in the morning and was given access to my room immediately. Upon arrival was served a delicious glass of tea as we did the paperwork. My room was cozy, had no television but, did have an open fire. Unfortunately, the wood was a little wet and my luggage ended up smelling like a campfire for the next 2 weeks. But, do not let that dissuade you from staying here. At one point there was no hot water but it was repaired immediately and I enjoyed the hottest most decadent shower.There was heating in the room, very important during these cooler winter months. The morning call to prayer seemed like it was next door so be…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2015,4,simple stle,This riad in Rabat is interesting because it has a simple style compared to the usually more elaborate architecture of these riads. There are some compromises like a curtain separating bath room to sleeping area but mostly the details are interesting. It is a bit of a walk from the main road but not too bad. Dinner there was good without being especially interesting.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2015,4,"An oasis, wish we could stay longer!","We were pleasantly surprised by this riad, and appreciated the special touches. After a 10-day rough and ready trip I was so appreciative of the bathtub, roses and special scents, not mention a very comfortable bed. Beautifully decorated, and I am sure the rooftop patio and pool would be wonderful in warmer weather. Breakfast was delicious too. Very close to the Kasbah, and we enjoyed a lovely dinner out at a nearby restaurant recommended by the hotel.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2015,2,"Wonderful, except for one deal-breaker: no bathroom privacy","Yes, it’s a lovely refurbished riad. Service was great. Etc. But in the Suite Etoilee the bathroom is separated from the rest of the room by a 3/4 length sheer curtain. If you are traveling by yourself or are OK lying in bed while listening to and watching your travel partner on the toilet, then no problem for you. For us, it was totally unacceptable. This is taking “en suite” much too far.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2014,4,A fine place in the heart of the Medina of Rabat,"Riad Kalaa has been carefully refurbished. Where ever you look, a keen eye for details was applied. Mosaics have been either mended or replaced. The bathroom of our room was a dream and invited for a soothing bath after day touring the city of Rabat. The room was most romantic and very clean. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Shortly after our arrival they spoiled us with a mint tea and sweets. As not to get lost on our first tour through the Medina we received a map and a clear and detailed explanation where to go. Many thanks, we had a great time!!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2014,5,Very nice stay.,Very nice place and we would return with no issues. The staff was very professional and courteous. They helped us coordinate tours and transportation. They even had a nice breakfast the morning we departed ... At 5am! Nice touch.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2014,5,Riad Kalaa,We booked a three night stay at Riad Kalaa on our way to Marrakech during our first visit to Morocco. Once we arrived in Marrakech we realized we should have stayed longer at Riad Kalaa. It is a beautiful location with amazing staff that are willing to answer any questions and provided us with the kind of holiday environment that we had hoped to experience. Everything is within walking distance and we enjoyed all of our treks through the city. I would highly recommend it to all people travelling to Rabat. E. Moore,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2014,4,Somewhat cool service and uncomfortable beds mar an otherwise lovely Riad.,"First the good: the Riad itself is very beautiful and the design over all is inspired. Gorgeous. And more importantly the food was FANTASTIC. We are both suppers here, something we have never done before. The food was that good. The rooms were fine but the beds were very hard, as were the pillows. And though I understand that the curtain separating the toilet from the room is a design choice, because the Riad is ancient, the drains smell a little funky. It would have been nice to have a door that closed. The service was fine. In any other country it would not have been worth a mention. But we have gotten used to a certain caliber of service here in morocco, friendly and lovely. The perfectly pleaant but cool people at this Riad were a contrast to the others where we stayed.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2014,4,Serenity in the Old Town Medina of Rabat,"A well run riad in a quiet part of the Medina if Rabat. Very personal service awaits, just ask. Authentic rooms with very high ceilings. Breakfast sets you up for the day. Serenity but only a minute from the raucous Sidi Fatah market lane which leads all the way through to the trams outside the southern walls off the Medina. Carry on straight (passed the Meditel shop for a SIM card and top up) and on to the square on rue Jeddah, which has exceptional coffee shops with excellent gateau.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2014,5,Wonderful Experience,"We arrived in Casablanca and continued to Rabat for a one-night stay. It was our first experience at walking along the narrow passageway of the medina to arrive at the large wooden door which opened to the spacious and very beautiful Riad Kalaa. The staff was charming and served us mint tea and Moroccan cookies when we arrived. Our room was luxurious and well appointed. The bathroom was amazing. The rooftop terrace and pool surrounded by white filigree woodwork was a very relaxing area. Breakfast was a great introduction to food in Morocco with freshly squeezed orange juice, good breads with honey and preserves, and a large variety of fruits with yogurt. We would love to return to Morocco one day and enjoy an extended stay at the Riad Kalaa.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2014,5,"Like being at a wealthy, tasteful, respectful relative's home","This review is long overdue, but the wonderful experience here lingers, and we are planning to bring our whole family here. The negative experiences of other travelers is likely due to their inability to adapt or perhaps their unrealistic expectations due to their own cultural limitations... so let's just address that first. Yes, if you have a room around the courtyard, it will not likely be peaceful and private. It's a courtyard, a common space around which ancillary spaces are situated, such as the guest rooms. It's an authentic luxury Riad in an authentic, not exactly luxurious Medina. If that's not the experience you desire, and it's so important to have the right light to put on your makeup, voluminous wasted space, television (seriously?), or a lift, stay somewhere…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2014,4,Beautiful!,"Hidden in the heart of the medina is this lovely, lovely place! Our room was breathtaking: huge sunken tub, fireplace, even a flat screen tv. Breakfast was the best we had anywhere in Morocco, wonderful--the home made yogurt was the best I've ever had. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was two reasons. First, the lighting in the room and bathroom was more ambient lighting. Beautiful--but a little tough to put on make up. Second, we were right off the court yard. Right. Off. The courtyard. The courtyard where people sat and visited and had drinks and maybe ate dinner? We heard every word. It still gets 4 stars because everything else was so awesome! I would stay there again in a heartbeat, though might request one of the upstairs rooms which are probably quieter.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,4,Truly an experience for all to have!,Let me preface my review with the fact that we normally stay at 4 or star hotels in suites. We did enjoy the experience and authenticity of staying in a riad and would recommend that anyone traveling to North Africa and Morocco experience staying in a medina for at least one night. Waking to the prayers at 5 am and on regular intervals and walking into the hear of the medina to our riad was a unique and authentic experience. The Riad Kalaa was quite charming and well maintained and adapted to modern times. One must realize that the age of the medina and the buildings will have certain structural and architectural limitations. Our room was spacious by these standards and was quite-well maintained and appointed. The charm of the old-world furnishings and the stone bathroom…,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2014,5,Great little place in the middle of the medina,"We spent a very enjoyable weekend here. Most others guests only seemed to stay for one night as part of a tour, which is sad since both the hotel and the city are worth exploring. Neither is at the top of the must-see lists, but Rabat is a charming and gentle way into Moroccan culture without the hassle and bustle of the better known cities, and the hotel is a quiet haven with charming staff, unique decor and good food. In a boutique hotel it is often the staff who make the real difference, and here, together with the wonderful location of the riad, more than make up for the lack of facilities that a larger site could afford.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2014,4,the Jasmine room was great!,"We stayed in the Jasmine room. It was not overly spacious (the 360 degree view they have on their website makes it look even smaller), but it was beautiful. The bathroom was amazing, which totally made up for the fact that we had to wiggle around our luggage just a tad. The staff are great, and served us with mint tea and Moroccan cookies upon our arrival. The rooftop pool and terraces are very relaxing (I am posting one photo that doesn't do it justice). Also, we stayed in several different towns across Morocco, and Rabat was by far our favorite. The Rabat medina is cleaner and less intense than the other ones, and had wider streets. Enthusiastic thumbs up for this Riad.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2014,5,Getting off to a good start,"We arrived in Casablanca and after visiting the Mosque continued to Rabat for the night. The first room we were shown was on the courtyard; we asked to see another toom and were shown one in a corner just off the courtyard, which we preferred. As indicated in other reviews the Riad is in a nice, relatively quiet location on the North end of the Medina, conveniently close to a very good restaurant where we dined that evening. Breakfast was one of the best we had in Morocco with good breads (4 different types) and the other usual suspects: honey and preserves, but alos a large variety of fruits and good and plain yogurt. Both the room and the Riad itself were quite nice and the staff was friendly and helpful.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2014,4,Great Riad in the medina,"Rabat has a brillient medina and Kalaa sits in the Northern part away from the bustle and noise but still within striking distance. Good food and a small swimming pool on the roof along with really well decorated rooms and atrium made this a great place to stay. Service was good on the whole. And here is the but. The staff's mobile phones seemed to be a distraction at times taking their attention away from the guests, and, the pings and ringing from them did distract from my enjoyment. Otherwise great.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2014,4,Excellent Management,"I'm a student studying in Rabat, and I have chronic back pain, so at home, I go to a chiropractor. When I'm traveling and need a quick fix, though, I like to go get a massage. Today, I went to Riad Kalaa for the 1 hour massage. The front desk attendant easily scheduled me in for an appointment later that day. When I returned, I was greeted kindly and shown immediately to my room, though I was slightly earlier than planned. I arrived at 5:35 pm, and was laying down on the massage table in the beautiful downstairs spa area by 5:40 pm. My masseuse was good, and the beginning of my massage was wonderful! However, after what I approximated to be about 35-40 minutes of massage, my masseuse placed cool cotton on my eyes and towels over me. After that, I did not see her, hear from her,…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2014,5,Lovely property,"Our first Riad in Morocco and hopefully the rest will be as good as this one Lovely feeling as we walked in and Danielle checked us in efficiently Beautiful room, comfortable bed, nice roof top area for a rest, a swim and relax Availability of beer and wine at the riad was appreciated as well Dinner and breakfast were okay but nothing special Very quite and clean with nice amenities as well Would recommend",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2014,5,Best Riad in Rabat,"This was our second stay in a Moroccan Riad, the first being in Marrakesh. We fell in love with these traditional and atmospheric houses and the Kalaa was no exception, a truly wonderful experience! Our stay was only for 3 nights and as our first night was a late arrival c/o hotel pickup taxi from the airport, we'd pre-ordered a Dinner and were not disappointed. Our room was on the top terrace overlooking the pool and the Rabat skyline. Although not the most expensive room in the hotel, we did prefer it to the more luxurious rooms, which we experienced, but preferred ours for one basic reason . . . we don't like air conditioning. So as the weather was warm our room had windows that opened on both sides, this provided a nice flow of air during the night providing a great nights…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2014,5,Wonderful find: a real experience on our business trip,"We needed a hotel for a two day visit to Rabat on business: decided to plump for something authentic in the Medina rather than a business travellers' hotel closer to our meeting venue. I am so glad we did: Kalaa is comfortable, welcoming and luxurious. The breakfast was generous and the supper fabulous. Service is charming and efficient. The bedrooms are a great balance between Moroccan vibe and modern luxury. Since we are working with the Moroccan Tourism office we will be back, and have every intention to stay at Kalaa again. Completely coincidentally a friend from the town in which our office is based had stayed at Kalaa the night before and was also pleased with it: and as he owns a hotel that's high praise indeed! The cat is nice, too.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2014,4,More modern riad,"Great location. Near medina, kasbah and beach. Welcoming staff. The offered train station transfer was 10x the taxi fare, so I wouldn't recommend it. The restaurant is recommended but I didn't have a chance to try. Basic Moroccan breakfast included.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2013,5,The best place where to stay in Rabat,"It's at 2 minutes walk from the Kasbah Oudaya and from Rue Ambassadeur. You can walk across the Souks inside the medina to get the center of the city. The Riad is very simple, very clean and warm. Only one knock for the owner, is to think to renew the Tadelakt that every guest will think that if a flood and not a moisture.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,4,Great Hotel like a Palace...,It is a great hotel like a palace and we really enjouyed it. The pool at the roof terace was great as the rooms. The room was nice and clean an big enough for 4 (we are are family with two children...). We would recommend staying here if you decide to travel to Rabat!,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2014,5,Perfect accommodation in a perfect location,"The Riad Kalaa is a wonderful establishment located in the old medinah. It is within walking distance of the Casbah, ocean an souk. It is beautifully restored. The rooms are beautiful, clean and well equipped. Breakfast is excellent. The staff members are friendly and helpful. There is an atrium where one can sit in a peaceful environment reading the excellant books which are available for guests. This is a riad and not a hotel. I therefore do not agree with other reviews concerning poor service. The staff members are ready to assist if you request them to do so. They do not bother tourists in an effort to earn huge tips, unlike what happens in the rest of Morocco. I therefore welcomed their discreetness. The riad was a safe haven where I could relax after a challenging day.…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Fantastic riad in the heart of the medina,This riad is great. The rooms are very clean. The staff is helpful and they speak near perfect English. They have maps and directions waiting upon arrival. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are in Rabat.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Moroccan Hospitality,"Riad Kalaa very kindly arranged our private transfer from Casablanca Airport. Due to a very delayed flight from London, we arrived at the edge of the Medina at 1:30am. Our driver ushered us and our luggage thru a maze of alleyway streets to the Riad while staff awaited our very late check-in. My husband and I were extremely impressed by the warm welcome we received. We were escorted up a series of staircases to the Celestial Suite. Disoriented at first, we then collapsed into a very deep and peaceful sleep. We awoke to a beautiful morning in this exceptionally charming and traditional Riad and enjoyed a lovely breakfast. A full morning tour of Rabat had been arranged and ended with a delicious lunch overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The late afternoon on the rooftop poolside…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2014,4,Great location ... Poor customer service,"This riad is in a great location. The riad is beautiful inside and it is extremely well decorated. The lights are amazing. The room we were in was beautiful with lots of exquisite touches. The pool area was also really nice and a lovely place to relax at the end of the day. Like other reviews the service was poor. We speak both English and French (native) and are both fluent in the other language. A nice welcome does not cost anything and would not go amiss! When asked directly the staff were helpful, when you could find them, and gave us good advice about Rabat. However it did not come naturally and had to be dragged from them. Breakfast was good though again the level of service was poor. There were three tables and we practically had to ask for every single thing. In…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2014,4,Simple and beautiful.,"We loved it here. We here with our children (21, 13, 13) This riad had a lovely old Morocco feel to it. It was a bit of a maze to find it down the narrow winding alleys inside the old Medina. It has much charm as does the medina. It was close enough to walk to the market which we did to buy some local wares. It is less expensive than Marrakesh for the same items, and more peaceful shopping here. The rooms were clean and nice, though a bit small. We enjoyed the roof top pool.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,4,Very nice,"A little bit of an oasis in the hustle and bustle of the medina although nowhere near as hectic as Fes or Marrakesh medinas. A traditional riad with nice staff and good food. Our room was basic without phone,TV or minibar but that didn't really matter.Very laid back atmosphere in the courtyard with dinner served at 6pm and was a fixed price.Would recommend this riad.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2014,5,Perfect in every way.,"Everything from the rooms themselves to the reception with mint tea and delicious home-made cookies to the plunge pool and lounging area on the roof to the helpful and courteous staff to the beautiful atrium to the relaxing little nooks here and there to the amazing selection of photography books to the Riad's central location to the breakfast, this place was a find and probably the best Riad experience we had during our 3 weeks in Morocco. We were only sorry to miss the home-cooked dinner from the Riad's kitchen (we were there on the one day the kitchen was closed). But there is nothing we could criticize about this place. We loved Rabat and wish we could have stayed at Riad Kalaa longer!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,3,Nice location unfriendly staff,The room on the ground floor was quiet humid the towel were wet due High humidity levels and damp in the room. If you dont smoke avoid the room in the patio because you will get the smell in your room. I will not stay again in this place no value for money.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2014,5,"The very definition of ""oasis""","Riad Kalaa is located rather deep within the baffling labyrinth of Rabat's medina. You would easily walk by it, never guessing from the stark exterior what lies within. What does lie within is a gorgeous, luxurious oasis and refuge from the somewhat maddening bustle of the streets and alleyways outside. The staff are kind and accommodating. The setting is at once both stimulating and relaxing. The people of Rabat (at least while we were there during Ramadan) are gentle and compassionate.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,5,Luxurious treat,This was a value for money little luxurious treat for us. Absolutely worth every cent. Room was gorgeous. Food was great. Staff were helpful. Cannot really ask for much more. A lovely haven from which to explore the charms of Rabat.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2014,5,Perfect,Idyllic peaceful and beautiful Riad in the atmospheric medina of Rabat... The restaurant is fantastic... We would emphatically recommend it to all and hope to visit in the future. Alice and Matt Sheffield England.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Elegant old world,"The Riad is located in the middle of the old town just blocks from the sea and the monuments. It is truly an oasis with a pool and deck, patio bar and courtyard. Excellent breakfast too. The rooms are elegantly appointed and roomy. The staff is very helpful and it is a quiet place.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2014,5,Exquisite riad,"This beautiful Riad is situated in the old medina of Rabat. The rooms are clean, spacious and nicely decorated. Breakfast is excellent and the staff as really nice and welcoming. The riad is situated within walking distance of the sea and to the Kasbah of the Udayas. I highly recommend this riad if you are visiting Rabat",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,2,Buyer beware,"The Riad advertises as having air conditioning, but, when you get there it turns out that not all suites have a/c. Mine did not and they could not give us a different suite. They gave us a floor fan, instead. You also expect to have hot water in your bathroom when you need it, even if it is early in the morning. We did not have hot water. There were light fixtures with burned out bulbs, and no replacement bulbs were available. The pluses were the décor, the pool, and the location. the Riad is pretty to look at, but I would not recommend it or stay there again.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2014,5,Only 1 night but beautiful,"Riad Kalaa was our first nights stay on a superb 2 week adventure with Around Morocco Tours. After an exhausting trip from NY to Casablanca, this place was a much welcomed destination. While we only spent 1 night here, the staff was very professional and the accommodations were beautiful. Our room was on the rooftop from which you could see the entire Medina of Rabat. I can't speak to the restaurant since we got in that evening and left the next morning. A brief mention: if you're looking for a soft bed to sleep on, they don't really exist here or anywhere else in Morocco for that mater. All mattresses are extremely firm, everywhere.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Very good Riad in excellent location,"We had very good stay in this Riad.It's location in Rabat is first class.No more than 5 minutes from the Kasbah, beach and souks. The staff were very good.I note from some previous reviews that they felt that the staff were a little cold which I think is a little unfair.What you have to realise is that this part of Morocco is very much influenced by France and therefore French is spoken as a second language rather than English.Therefore a little Frenchnwill go a long way.Having said that the 3 receptionists that we dealt with all spoke excellent English. The provision of complimentary fresh fruit and soft drinks in the room was a lovely touch. The room was very comfortable albeit a little eccentric in that there was a lounge downstairs and the bedroom up some fairly steep stais…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2014,5,Favorite Riad during our 10 day Tour in Morocco,"Riad Kalaa was our favorite riad in Mococco. The grounds are beautiful, especially the pool and terrace upstairs. Our room was large and I loved the historical feel of the rooms while enjoying quality modern conveniences. The beds, sheets and down comforters were very luxurious and the comfortable rooms were so nice to come home to after a long day out exploring. The dinner was very good and very reasonably priced and the breakfasts were also delicious. Daniella, our hostess, was very accomodating and sweet.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,5,good,"boutique riad, elegant and modern with a touch of antiquity. well maintained rooms with narrow but well-appointed and stylish. beautiful riad in the medina of Rabat floor, comfortable and not touristy. maybe a little cold, but really a good solution. staff were polite but aloof. priced accordingly maybe a little high.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,3,Below expectation,"We have used Trip Advisor ratings as the basis for choosing our accommodations during our travels,however we were quite disappointed with this experience. While the concepts behind the Riads in Morocco seem seem admirable, in reality they disappoint guests used to professionally run hotels. In our case here, the room we had was very small, and hence not comfortable. The location of the Riad was not in a desirable area, and we were warned not to go outside after dark. The manager and the cook in restaurant were extremely hospitable, so they compensated to an extent the discomfort of the room.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,5,"Beautiful riad, fantastic host, luxurious accommodations","Had the most pleasant stay at Riad Kalaa. After staying in 5 riads during my 10-day tour, Riad Kalaa was by far the best from all angles. - Rooms were tasteful, luxurious, and comfortable. Plush beds, high threadcount sheets and comforter, with modern bathroom, air-con, and full in-room amenities. Every little thing was accounted for in the room. - Host - Daniela was the most welcoming and hospitable host, helping us with the local area, providing recommendations, and ensuring our rooms were of utmost comfort to us. - Food - our dinner at the riad was also phenomenal and one of our best meals in Morocco. All ingredients were fresh and Daniela even provided us insight into what was most fresh. - Property - the riad was very intimate and homey. The public spaces was…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Wonderful riad in Rabat,"Our group stayed here for three nights. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, even if their English was limited. They were very patient with our butchered French... The rooftop garden and pool were a special treat. Rooms were very nice, with dramatically high ceilings, large tubs, and wonderful Moroccan furnishings. We took a cooking class in the riad that was a lot of fun, and the traditional Moroccan meal we created was better than some that we had in restaurants! The riad is short walk to the main part of the medina in Rabat, and to the Kasbah on the waterfront.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Amazing room and riad,We only stayed one night but this was one of our best riads we stayed in. Room is fantastic and terrace area great with lovely pool. Prefer to get room upstairs. Location in the Medina is easily reached. Staff were very helpful. Dinner was lovely however overpriced. True Moroccan experience.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,5,The most beautiful place I have ever been to!,"We spent two night during our honeymoon travel at the Riad Kalaa. It was the most beautiful place I have ever been to! We were given a wonderful room with immensely high ceilings, a huge bathroom sprinkled with roses and with a sunken bath tub and such beautiful furniture and decoration I wished I could have taken everything with me! The hotel staff was extremely friendly and sitting and dinner in the inner courtyard was as romantic as it gets. Simply amazing!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,5,A Great Experience,"We were doing a private tour through Morocco, organized from Australia with Ibertours.This Riad was chosen by our tour company and as such I don't know the price. We stayed for one night and included breakfast. Our driver had rung the Riad and we were met in the carpark and shown the way to the riad. We were warmly greeted and offered juice (which turned out to be freshly squeezed orange juice) and petit fours, while we perused the menu for dinner. This was the beginning of our love affair with Moroccan Oranges! Our room, Santal, was located upstairs (our bags had been taken up) on the pool level. Its a lovely room, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The rain shower was wonderful and the toilettries provided were in recyclable glass jars. Big soft, fluffy towels…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,2,Riad looked nice but staff ruined experience,"I'll make this a short review as we stayed here for one night, but something was off about this place. The room ""looked"" nice but was damp and we kept coughing, something was in the air. But, what bothered us most, was the rude attitude of the staff. Does it hurt them to smile or be friendly? They weren't pleasant at all. I honestly can't think of one person who was pleasant. This obviously makes for an uncomfortable experience for the guest. The dinner, as far as taste goes, was good. Again, service gruff. Breakfast not good, meager. When she poured the coffee, she would fill the cup only part full and take the coffee pot with her. Glad we only stayed one night en route.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,4,Nice riad in Rabat,We arrived at Riad Kalaa in the early evening after a very long flight and then drive from Casablanca. Our driver parked at the nearest entrance to the medina and we were met by a friendly representative from the riad who helped us carry our luggage inside via a few narrow alleys. We were greeted at Riad Kalaa with refreshing atai or moroccan mint tea. The riad has a beautiful courtyard and our rooms were just off this courtyard on the ground floor. They were comfortable and the bathroom was a bit small but well fitted out.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,3,nice riad but lacks good service,"This was the third riad we stayed in Morocco. The previous two (in Fez and Essaouira) were so beautiful and the service so amazing that this one didn't seem particularly special. The location is great and the riad itself quite beautiful. However, when we first arrived, the man who came to answer the door to take us in was a bit rude. He told us to sit and fill out all the paper works but didn't offer us anything to drink, nor was he particularly friendly. Once we were done with the paperworks, he took us to our room and left. I had some questions to ask and when I went outside int the couryard/reception area, I couldn't find anyone. I had to knock on the kitchen door to get people's attention. Basically, there's no nice greetings like we've experienced in the other raids. The…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,5,First Riad experience,"Although we stayed only for a night, the property was excellent. Great staff support, the rooms were well maintained, the bathrooms clean and well stocked with all toiletries. The rooms were sufficient for 2 people. We had dinner at the property and our first experience of a Tajine was good. They allowed us to bring in our own bottle of single malt at the dinner table, without any corkage.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,4,rabat riad stay,"Decent place to stay in rabat . We stayed here for only one night before going to fes . Tried the dinner in hotel which was quite good . Good service by the riad team . Rooms are quite small but i guess this is how all riads are !! Also since the rooms are close to each other , one needs to be extra careful while talking so as to not disturb the other guests . would recommend this riad for people travelling to rabat .",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2014,5,Excellent service and good location,"Great location Excellent service Nice rooms Clean and safe Everyone was very pleasant and they had nice tea and snacks available and breakfast was good and since I left early for the airport, they accommodated an early breakfast",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2014,4,"comfortable, Cleam Riad in heart of Medina","A very nice small riad and a friendly atmosphere. Serves very good food if you let them know you want dinner ahead and also close to Dinarjatt another fine spot with Moroccan fare. Some great room layouts, if travelling with kids. We were able to put them in 2 comfortable beds downstairs, while the bed and bath were located in a loft above.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2014,4,A charming intro to Morocco,"We so enjoyed our 3-night stay at Riad Kalaa. The Riad is beautifully decorated in local style, with colorful upholstery, carved lanterns, comfortable modern bathrooms, and a quirky but charming layout. The bar and spa were two of our favorite areas-- both downstairs. The massage was the best I've ever had. The staff was mostly helpful, especially with helping us add a second room to accommodate our children, with dinner recommendations, and with confirming our riad in Marrakech. Two little suggestions-- first, the pool area was under renovation, so sitting out by the pool was only possible one day when the crew was not working. Perhaps the staff could have apologized for that and told us when the pool would be available. And second, the breakfast service was extremely…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2014,5,Excellent location in the Rabat medina,"The riad is well located in a quiet area but very close to the Kasbah and other interesting areas. The dinners are very good - better than Dinarjat, which is only a short block away. Breakfast was substantial and delicious. The room was large and the bathroom was really big. The terrace has a great view over the medina. The staff was very helpful but make you are very specific in your requests - we thought we had asked for an English speaking to drive us to Fez but what we got was a French speaking driver.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2014,4,Mixed feelings...,"This was our last night in Morocco after a ten day road trip! There are lots of really positive things about this riad! The interior decorating is absolutely perfect, with a very relaxing atmosphere. The evening dinner was excellent and very reasonable. The room was very confortable and so charming.It is ideally situated, easy to find and we had no problem finding parking a few minutes away by foot. Compared to the other places we stayed in Morocco, unfortunately we found the staff a bit unfriendly. The breakfast was also disappointing, the store bought cakes and jams were not great. They also sat us right next to the kitchen, and the noise was anything but relaxing. We could have asked to move away from the noise, but we saw the face the waitress made to another couple when…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2014,5,Stay in Riad Kalaa,"Riad Kalaa was a fantastic experience for us. Arriving late, we used the map provided by the management to find the hotel. This was more than useful. Thank you! Rooms, rooftop terrace, the whole atmosphere is great. Breakfast very good!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2014,5,Riad Kalaa - a delight in Rabat,"This is a fabulous hotel we are keen to return too, and the city of Rabat is a delight with everything you wish to see in Morocco but at a gentler pace of life. Riad Kalaa is blessed with a superb baker and an equally superb chef thus breakfast pastries and dinner are guaranteed to delight. The Riad is located in the Medina and we recommend ou call ahead and the hotel staff meet you and guide you from the nearest gate (Bab) which is the one near the kasbah. Taxi fare from the station by petit taxi is 10DM (the driver will ask you for 20 or 30DM but get the taximeter gong and its max 10DM) People and Medina friendly - less pushy than in other ciies",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2014,3,It really depends on what you are looking for...,"We had just arrived after staying in a lovely Riad in Fes. First, if you have never stayed in a Riad know that it is essentially an old residence with an interior courtyard that has turned the courtyard rooms into guest rooms. There are for the most part no windows bringing in light from the outside. That means that even if your Riad room has lots of windows, they are still looking into the courtyard and often across the way into other people's rooms and vice versa. These rooms are also generally very low lit. The plus side is it should be quiet at night but dark and a somewhat closed in feeling. (sorry for the lengthy explanation but we didn't quite grasp all of this before coming to Morocco). The Riad Kalaa is in the medina which has wide and clean streets which is a plus.…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2014,5,A chilly early March in Rabat,"Or son is spending the year in Rabat, and there was no doubt in his mind what the best place to stay was (certainly not his). He steered us to Riqd Kalaa. Arriving there after a long arduous trip, we enjoyed the best dinner of our entire ten days in the country which included five cities. The room was terrific, quiet, large by Medina standards, and very clean. Once you figure your way in and out of the streets (alleys?), which takes just a brief amount of time, everything of interest is within walking distance. Go for it!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2014,4,Nice chilled atmosphere,This was my first visit to Morocco and I must say the Raid Kalaa was a nice place to stay whilst enjoying the country. We were only there for 2 nights for a friends birthday but it did make an impression. The rooms we got were nice and big with the high ceiling's and the decor was nice too. I was rather envious of the birthday girls room as it was so beautiful and designed elegantly. The bathroom was a strangely designed with the toilet facing the window and the walls were thin so you can imagine it being a bit awkward when in there. The thought that maybe someone sitting out there could hear all the goings on in your bathroom was off putting. Staff were mostly friendly but because of the language barrier I thought they were friendlier to guests who spoke French or Arabic. I…,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2014,4,Beautiful Riad in the Medina,"We got the opportunity to stay here our first night in Morocco. Had our driver not led us to it, we would have never found the place, as it's located deep inside the medina. However, we were very happy with the accommodations. Perfectly located to visit the old kasbah. Our room, #20, was on the ground floor just off the courtyard. It was beautiful, with authentic Moroccan touches. The only sketchy thing was that the bathtub is semi-sunken and quite slippery when you step in. There is no shower curtain, so when I powered up the water, the hose kind of got away from me and pretty much sprayed the whole room! Good water pressure! The staff is a bit stiff, but I'll just call them ""being professional"".",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2013,4,A decent riad in Rabat,"This was our first riad in Morocco and we found it to be a great way to start the trip. It is a small riad with tiny but quaint, cute rooms. The location was ideal, walking distance to many sights in and around the medina. The breakfast was wonderful as was the dinner. The only minor complaint was that it was quite cold in the courtyard where meals were served in late December.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2014,3,"Beautiful riad, staff we interacted with not super friendly","This riad was beautiful and our room was gorgeous. The breakfast was very good, and the wifi worked well. However, we arrived around 9pm and I think the owner must have been gone for the day because the staff that greeted us were not super welcoming. Very business-like, not friendly like the other riads we stayed at. Same thing when we were served breakfast, staff not very cheerful.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2014,4,Cosy Riad but passive service,"This is a nice Riad, spoiled a little by passive service. It is centrally located in the residential part of the old medina. It is a short walk to the old souks, and we found the surrounding neighbourhood to be safe. You can also easily walk to all central sights from this location. The Riad has a plain entry, but once inside the central courtyard is delightful. Our room was up on the roof, which in warmer weather would be a lovely area to relax around the pool. There are also several lounges to relax in. Our room was lovely, decorated in a really tasteful Moroccan Islamic style. The bathroom facilities, heating, bedding and furnishings were all in tip top condition. Bathroom was well sized and finished in polished concrete with moorish touches. Wifi worked well, but better in…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2014,4,Riad Kalaa,"Its a nice riad inside of Medina. Clean and up-class. Rooms are very nice and comfortable. Staff are very nice and helpful.

The bed room I feel just a little small, otherwise its just perfect.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2014,1,More than meets the Eye,"PROBLEMS from the start..made booking on Expedia, called to explain late arrival, required us to email despite guaranteed booking..this was my fifth riad in 14 days, only one to charge me taxes despite Expedia saying ""taxes included""..misled me with total by charging 33% more for two kids despite no mention in Expedia total and fact we left at 5 AM and no breakfast that time of the morning..Riad arranged transfer to airport and after three assurances driver was late...unknown to me Riad asked for 3%+ to use a credit card...take off your system, this place is not friendly...Lee",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2013,4,Fine to look at but has deficiencies,"The decoration of the Riad Kalaa, has been done by well-intentioned but impractical modern architects, arranging things for the eye only, like Italian pastrycooks who put no butter in the mix. Inside our room everything looked good, especially the high ceilings, the intricate woodwork etc but, with the exception of the comfortable beds, nothing really worked the way that it should. Worst was the bath, a vast double-person monstrosity of Ancient Roman or Napoleonic dimensions, semi-sunk below floor level with a shower over it, no handgrips, engineered to ensure fatal falls for the unwary. A false fireplace complete with fake logs occupied one corner leaving space for only one suitcase. The breakfasts and dinners were excellent even if the service was a little chilly.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2013,4,Lovely riad,"We spent a night here, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Our first riad experience, we arrived to find a beautifully decorated courtyard and were welcomed with tea and cookies. The room on the ground floor had soaring ceilings, and ethnic light fixtures. Very comfortable, though an upper floor room might be less noisy and more private. Dinner was very tasty and the service was quite good. Breakfast was very filling, and we left the riad with fond memories. Like many riads, it can be hard to find and get to on your own, so you'll want to call ahead or let your local guide or tour operator do the booking.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2013,4,Elegant and magical place,"The riad appears to have been renovated and decorated quite recently, in elegant taste. Our room was decked with magical subdued lighting and elegant fabrics, with a comfortable bed and good reading lamps by the bed. A welcoming plate of mandarine oranges was provided, as well as bottled water. The bathroom was spacious and well appointed, with luxurious, locally made shampoo and bath gel, although these were presented in little glass bottles, which we were afraid we might break. The sunken bath was big enough for two, but a bit of a challenge to get in and out of for older people. Breakfasts were excellent and we were able to get espresso (for an extra charge). We had dinner at the riad and thought the food was quite good; although expensive by local standards, we appreciated…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2013,4,Beautiful riad,"We stayed at this riad for one night as part of a tour booking. It was our first riad experience and very positive. The building has been renovated with care and attention to details and is beautiful. The public rooms and bedrooms are delightfully designed and furnished with traditional crafts. Service was good if a little reserved. Dinner was nicely served and reasonable value for a tasty meal. Breakfast was also a delight with a variety of fruits, yogurt, breads and fresh pressed orange juice. The only negative was that the riad had no hot water in the morning and did nothing to warn visitors of this or have any remedy. The riad is in the medina and well located for sightseeing.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2013,5,Delightful oasis,"Consistent with the other reviews, we had a lovely stay here. The building is a lovely historic house, and as we were there in December, the courtyard was covered, but still light and airy. We had rooms on the upper floor, which were beautifully finished and furnished, complete with little fireplaces and a superb bathroom with a tub, just the job for a chilly evening. We also ate in the Riad and had a very good meal. My only reservation is the lack of really comfy seating. The chairs are all very small. As my two companions were well over 6 feet tall, this proved a bit of an issue. If I were staying for longer, I would like to be able to lounge somewhere. The medina in Rabat is well worth a visit, with lovely old buildings, winding alleyways, and very good shopping. All around a…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2013,5,A nearly perfect spot in the Rabat medina,"Riad Kalaa is a wonderful oasis in the middle of Rabat's medina. After driving around the city to get to the riad, we were a little nervous about what to expect. But once we were greeted at the door and invited inside, we knew we made the right choice. Riad Kalaa is design and decorated in the spirit of a traditional riad. Well, almost. A traditional riad generates air circulation through its open central courtyard: air is intended to flow down into the courtyard, be cooled over the central fountain, and then around the interior of the building. RK has a transparent tarp covering the roof of the courtyard, preventing that airflow. Since there's no air conditioning in the building, it does get warm. However, the room we had was large and beautiful. We were amazed by the…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2013,5,My home in Morocco,"I've stayed here several times, and consider Kalaa my second home in Rabat. Aisha and the rest of the staff are warm and attentive, and the riad is beautifully kept. The Saharan suites on the ground floor have soaring 20-foot ceilings with beautiful Moroccan lamps. My room had a large bathroom with a tub, plenty of hot water, and fantastic orange blossom bath products. Beds are firm but comfortable, and are double-sheeted with a fluffy comforter and embroidered linens with the riad's logo. The hotel has a modest rooftop terrace with what's probably a 7-foot long pool and a few lounge chairs. There's an upper level with several couches and tables, although the wifi isn't always reliable on the roof. When it's raining, the ground floor courtyard is a beautiful place to enjoy a…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2013,5,We where a very happy group!,Great experience to stay here. If you choose a Riad - you know what you are expecting. Not a 5 star+ modern luxury hotel - but something with charm. This is what you get! We where a group of 14 persons and we where all so overwhelmed. If you want to eat order it beforehand. There is nothing like restaurant facilities and 24 hours service. Dear travelers - when you book where to stay - make some research and you will not have the wrong expectations and because of that disappointment. This is a wonderful place to stay!,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2013,3,"good location, small rooms, no privacy","Arriving late by plane , we were in the hotel around 22.00. We were received friendly but it was a problem to get something to eat although we got some kebab and rice after asking. The little seats in the courtyard were too small to sit properly. The room was very small and had large doors and windows only opening to the courtyard. Even the bathroom only had some privacy when you closed the shutters. Also the room has no cupboards and hardly any place to put a suitcase. Breakfast was very nice (but exactly the same every morning) in the court yard or adjacent room. The roof terrace was a deception. Although the weather beginning of November was still nice there were only smelling matrasses without covers, so no place to enjoy the sun for a while. Not our favourite.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2013,3,We did not stay,When we arrived we were shown to our suite we found it had no windows and was insufferably hot and no air conditioner. Generally the rooms appeared to be small and cramped even though overall the riad had some charm. The manager graciously allowed us to cancel as the heat was clearly a problem. We drove on to Casablanca.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2013,4,Lovely old style Riad in old town,Arrival: As part of our Morocco trip we decided to also take in Rabat to check out the Capital. We arrived by train from Marrakech and were met by 2 men holding up our a sign with our name on it for the pre-arranged transport to Riad Kalaa. The drivers never spoke a word of English and were very abrupt ushering us straight out of the train station into an old beat up car. We tried to speak to them a few times but they ignored us so we assumed they couldn’t speak English. After an interesting 10minutes with my wife starting to get a little anxious we pulled up in the old town and were then walked the rest of the way for 5mins with our bags through the beautiful white walls of the old town to the entrance for Riad Kalaa. After ringing the doorbell a few times after a few…,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2013,5,The most magical place in Morocco,"This Riad/hotel is one of the most magical places we have been too! this beautiful hotel is located amongst the streets of the Medina in Rabat, let be honest whilst the Medina is full of charms it is also full of rubbish and some unpleasant smells. However, you only have to knock on the massive door to know that something special is about to happen. the Riad is full perfectly orquestrated details. we stayed at the Nomade suite, which we will recommend. come in and enjoy the beautiful Morocco at its best!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2013,5,Rabat at its best,"Arriving late by plane , met by a friendly taxi man organised by the hotel and at around 11 pm still getting a delicious dinner served under stars in the open court yard was only the start of pleasant 2 days at this stylish hotel. When the booked tour guide did not show up on time the manageress Laetitia offered us 2 free massages to compensate for the inconvenience although they had immediately found anouther good guide. Breakfast is celebrated in the court yard , a great start for the day, a roof rerrace with a small pool adds to the very positive stay there as do all the extra friendly staff. A place to return to !",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,4,Would have given them a 5 but...,"We recently stayed with a group of 6 friends at Riad Kalaa in Rabat. The rooms were on the small side but comfortable and nicely decorated. Dinner was good and nicely served but breakfast was extremely SLOW. I do understand that they only had one employee to serve several people but they should hire more help. We had to wait a long time and ask for sugar, hot water, napkins, etc. Too bad as the riad is very nice. Overall, our group enjoyed the small and refreshing rooftop pool and our stay. Hopefully, they will consider hiring extra help when the riad is full.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,5,Highly recommended,I loved everything about staying here! The location is excellent. It is in the heart of the Medina near the souks. The Riad is beautiful. There is a lot of shared common space including the top floor. The staff was attentive and kind. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2013,4,Lovely place,Lovely place with pleasant rooms with unique decors and friendly staff. Fruit basket and complimentary beverages in the refrigerator. Breakfasts were outstanding with cordial servers. Good location a short walk to the Casbah and right in the heart of the Medina. The have their own van and driver for pick-up and drop off at the airport and train station which is a very nice plus. Staff very helpful in providing directions to local attractions and dining advice.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2013,4,Delightful Riad in Rabat,"Location is great, close to Kasbah of the Oudayas, krafts market and souk. Riad Kalaa is delightful, staff were friendly, flexible and efficient. I found my room very charming and comfortable. Don't miss their sumptuous traditional breakfast.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2013,3,Overnight stay,"We only had an overnight here. Small room, clean and neat. Would need a bigger room if staying longer. This was not the best looking Riad we have stayed in but the staff were very, very good. It was a Sunday night and the hotel restaurant was closed, but the Manager made us a booking at another restaurant which was a great experience. The breakfast next morning was lovely having it served at our table by the young girl that settled us in the night before.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2013,4,Wonderful introduction to Riads in Morocco,"Our group stayed at Riad Kalaa (and some at Riad Azahra - sister riad down the alley). Rabat was our first overnight stop after arriving in Morocco that day and everyone really enjoyed the experience. Friendly staff and service - staff rearrange furniture to accommodate full group around one table for meals. I have been many times to Morocco and stay at various riads in different cities and Riad Kalaa (and Azahra) is equal to the best of them - wonderful facilities, comfortable, clean and welcoming.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2013,3,Our overnight stay,In general our stay was good..nice atmosphere however slow service. The room was OK but the arch in the bathroom is dangerously low..we kept hitting our heads even if it was an overnight stay. Do not forget to taste d mint tea while there..it's really good :-),Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,5,A Jewel of a Riad in the Old Medina of Rabat,"I had the pleasure of visiting Riad Kalaa again recently - this time for a business event which I hosted there. Once again, I was delighted with the service and the quality of the food and the rooms! The Riad Kalaa is tucked behind a large wooden door in a tiny alleyway of the Rabat medina. First-time visitors may wonder where they are being taken as they are guided to the riad. Inside, a lovely courtyard awaits with an atrium ceiling open to the sky. Our conference brought together scholar from all over the world and so we took over the entire riad for almost a week. We relied heavily on the staff for accommodations, guides, reservations, and food service. It was an amazing week thanks to the Riad Kalaa group. The food was amazing - lunches were served in the courtyard with…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2013,3,disappointing..,"we seemed to be treated with annoyance & irratation upon our arrival. even after l showed the office staff the booking & subsequent visa card deposit that l had made with latitea, we were told we did not have a booking. we were eventualy upgraded to riad around the corner for one night until a room was vacated at kalaa the next day. sorry to say we were over the place by then. we had looked forward to spoiling ourselves here as it was the end of our two week trip around morocco, but sad to say it was a big let down! we did not even stay to eat at night but found a nice welcoming place in the medina.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,5,"Great Stay! Anthony, Virginia Tech","As part of the Virginia Tech conference, as well as my first time in Morocco, the staff was stellar and incredibly considerate. The service was phenomenal, the food delicious, rooms comfortable, and the atmosphere inviting. I wish I could've stayed longer. Thanks to everyone at Riad Kalaa and Riad Art for making our time there so special :-)",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,5,Wedding party and group stay,"We chose Riad Kalaa (via online searches and Trip Advisor from our base in Dubai) to celebrate our wedding with family and friends who flew in from around the world, as well as my husband's family and friends from his home town of Rabat. The riad was private for our use for two nights, Friday and Saturday (the wedding party) and we filled all 11 rooms with our guests. The management of the Riad were very helpful in the months and days leading up to the party and group arrival. We 100% recommend Riad Kalaa for such a party, we had 40 guests and the venue was the perfect size and setting with its beautiful courtyard and terraces. Even our local Rabati friends were impressed as they hadn't been aware of it. The event set up was perfect, including lovely florals all arranged by…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,3,Wedding guest,"We stayed here for two nights in September as part of a wedding party. We had previously spent (based on tripadvisor) 8 nights at other riad's and hotels around morocco as part of our main yearly holiday. This was by far the most expensive riad and unfortunately the most disappointing.... Reasons I was disappointed...(.mainly due to the money spent...) 1) There was no hot water on the evening of the wedding. Also there were no fresh towels in our room so my partner went down to reception in just my beach towel... 2) we had ants all over the bed and when we told the staff they simply brushed them off the bed and laughed. This didn't seem to be a problem to the staff that there were ants everywhere...! 3) staff, as the other comment below says, we're unwelcoming. Something I had…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,1,"Avoid it, avoid it, avoid it","We've stayed for 4 nights in one of the ""Les chambres aux milles parfums"" rooms and we had a very disappointing and stressful experience because: 1. the room we were is was dirty and it look like it has been very superficially cleaned for years and the dirt is just pilling up 2. there is no door between the bathroom and the room (no other comments) 3. the bathroom was very moldy and smelled of mold 4. the staff do not speak English at all and they are very dismissive of the guests 5. MOST IMPORTANT: it is very expensive for what you get",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2013,5,"Superb Riad, great location","We spent one night in Riad Kalaa as a treat - the rooms are decorated amazingly and we had the best nights sleep by far. It us tucked away in the medina, easy walking to the souks, kasbeh and restaurants in the new town. Would certainly recommend",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2013,5,Excellent,The Riad is very nicely done. The food was amazing. The parking could be challenging since it takes few minutes from central parking. The rooms have over 20 feet ceiling decorated very well. The bathroom are adobe style sank bath . The kids loved the bath. The roof top pool has nice view. If you have kids make sure to call ahead for crib. The site manager was bit confused about kids. The other staff were very accommodating. Don't miss breakfast .,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2013,1,Total lack of most things,"We have just left this hotel after 1 night (July 29 2013). I cannot really say anything good apartfrom the quaint decor. On arrival we were treated as an inconvenience rather than a guest by the reception staff. Our room was on the top floor beside the pool. As we walked in the room smelt musty and the bathroom had a very distict smell of mould. The stairs leading up were narrow and steep. The room layout was terrible. The ""door"" to the bathroom was a curtain. There was no TV, mini-bar or telephone in the room. Worst off all, there was no hot water when we showered at 6:30am. We had to leave early to catch our train so went to breakfast at the 7am start time. No sraff arrived untill 7:15 so we had to leave without breakfast. I would not recomend this hotel in any circumstance.…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2013,3,Not great given it's expensive,"Deep in the city walls sits this riad. Like so many other Moroccan buildings, its plain exterior acts as a facade for its true heart: a beautiful central courtyard surrounded by rooms that are well appointed, though a but a bit of a study in beige. Having recently toured Morocco the rooms here feel a little forgettable and rather plain in comparison with others. The rooftop pool is a bonus and a delightful place to plant yourself in the heat of the day. Laetitia was a kind and friendly hostess who did a great job of ensuring that ours (we were a party of 7) was a happy stay. Aiysha also had a good and gently hospitable manner. So...what went wrong? Well, it's just that the service from everyone else there felt very indifferent. All through Morocco we have been made to feel extra…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Girlfriends Adventure,"I went with two of my best friends to a scientific meeting and stayed at this excellent Riad. We loved everything about it!. It is conveniently located in the North Corner of the beautiful Medina, where it is quiet and peaceful, yet close enough to the wall to walk for taxis (which are very inexpensive). Nevertheless, you are also close enough to walk to the more exotic, fun and overwhelmingly confusing maze of the busy market. The Riad's staff was excellent; helpful, courteous and friendly. The Riad itself is a gem, the rooms are beautifully decorated and there is a roof terrace and a great little swimming pool to relax in after a day in the market...I am already planning my next trip...Oh, I forgot, the breakfast is a plus...",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Lives up to expectations!,"This Riad certainly deserves it high rankings. The staff are extremely polite, competetant, and efficient. The food is great. We stayed in one of the multi-level rooms with our two kids (4 yr and 18 month) and had plenty of space. The main terrace was so nice and relaxing we never discovered the roof top terrace and pool until it was too late. Most everything was in walking distance, and if not was only a cheap taxi ride from the Riad (with the exception if you fly into Casablanca vs Rabat, which was a $70 1.5 hr vs $25 20 min taxi ride). I do a lot of business travel, and this certainly would be appropriate for business travel. If you staye in atraditional hotel, you would miss out on an opportunity for a great ""authentic"" experience.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Exciting and stylish,"Very beautifully decorated with a lovely courtyard to relax and eat in. Our suite, opening to the courtyard, was perfect and cozy with a lovely sitting area and a gorgeous spacious bathroom with a double tub. The food was delicious. This was our first night in Morocco, and it was a wonderful introduction. The upstairs patio has an incredible view out over the city , plus a small pool. We were thrilled with everything.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Simply Superb,"The Riad Kalaa is perfection wrapped up in the walls of Rabat's old medina. Even before arriving, I was impressed by the helpful quick responses from the staff to my endless array of questions. Upon arriving I was immediately welcomed with fresh squeezed orange juice (yum!). Instead of having to stand around and wait to register and my room - I was able to relax in the beautifully appointed courtyard. My room was nicely arranging - filled with fresh fruit, water and a variety of drinks. Breakfast each morning was delicious with a variety of breads and other typical Moroccan dishes - and always some fresh orange juice and good coffee. I had the chance to eat dinner one night in the Riad and the food was excellent including the wine. There was always a staff member around (even…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2013,5,Tranquility and relaxation minutes from the best places to see in Rabat,What a serene and beautiful oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of Rabat. We stayed in the Riad for 4 days and every need was taken care of within an instant and always with a smile. The staff are professional yet incredibly helpful and willing to go the extra mile to assist. The welcome at the Riad was accompanied by a refreshing glass of mint tea (has to be tried) and a quick look at a map with the best places to visit clearly highlighted. Breakfast was amazing and can be eaten either in the tranquil courtyard or up on the roof tops. Simply the best place to stay and experience the real Morocco.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2013,5,Style and Grace in the Rabat Medina,"The Riad Kalaa offers a beautiful, graceful, and absolutely comfortable accommodation in the old medina of Rabat, Morocco. I've stayed there four times and love it more each time. The rooms have incredibly high ceilings and are appointed in contemporary Moroccan style. The open central courtyard is beautiful. Food is excellent, staff is wonderful. I love it there! Will be back in September!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2013,4,Excellent Riad,"The room was great, the shower needed a little maintenance, and the toilet rocked on its foundation, but an excellent riad with lovely decor in the open interior courtyard / garden. Not so easy the find but excellent when you get there. Breakfast was delicious, the staff friendly and the service second to none. Highly recommended.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2013,5,Attention to detail,"My husband and I stayed here a few years ago and then again a few weeks for or one night. We stayed in one of the upstairs standard rooms. While smaller than the rooms downstairs, it was large enough for 2 people. The decor is beautiful. Such attention to detail, like the decoration on the tiles around the base of the wall, in the shower, etc. It is beautifully designed and well thought through. We had dinner at the riad and it was very good. Breakfast was varied and good and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2013,5,Great location,"If you are looking for a great place to be you should come here. Unfortunately we didn't sleep here but the dinner, especially the athmosphaere is great! Try it out! It's really great!!!! It is not easy to find but GPS helped us to find the way!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2013,4,Nice Riad - loved the shower!,"Overall this is a lovely Riad. Our room was on the second floor - the only thing missing for us was a top sheet instead of just a comforter. The bathroom was small and it had no door - only a curtain - (which was OK with us). The restaurant was closed the night we were there, so the staff recommended a little restaurant a few minutes walk around the corner which was totally wonderful. There were two men playing instruments and after we dined we lingered totally immersed in the music. The breakfast was very good also. It was too cool to sit in the pool area on the roof. One thing - the smoking - in fact, that is a huge negative for us travelling throughout Morocco.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2013,4,nice pastries,"We were greeted with some Moroccan tea and the tastiest pastries :) That is always a good start to a hotel stay. The room was comfortable and the food was acceptable. It was cold and rainy when we got and we were staying for only one night, so we did not really get to see city much. My one issue was the smoking. Like a previous poster said, they close up the riad area in cold and rain, and people smoke inside and it gets really bad sometimes. Also, the staff kept squabbling regardless of whether or not guests were around. Overall, nice establishment. They need to work on the smoke and the squabbling though.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2013,3,No Aloha,"This is a very lovely Riad, and my room was beautiful and well-appointed. I was on the second floor in the middle and it was very quiet. I would stay here again were I in Rabat, but the staff needs a bit of education in the art of running an inn. When I got to reception there was a heated squabble going on between the three women there (in French, so I have no idea what the problem was), and I was left to stand for some time while they bickered. When they finally got to checking me in there was a very perfunctory introduction to the city with a map and that was it. I wasn't told about the dinner that I could have in the Riad if I liked, no mention of breakfast or what time or where it would be, I wasn't shown anything in the room (how to work the safe, etc.); essentially,…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2013,5,Beautiful and relaxing,"Lovely friendly riad - smaller than others we stayed in, but memorable for the room on the roof near the pool and the fantastic dinner. Quite easy to find again after you've been led there the first time, and the medina easy to negotiate also. Lovely fruit in the room and nicely decorated throughout. We ordered our tagine for dinner when we arrived and both options were delicious, as where the Moroccan salads, breads and lemon puddings. We found the service informal and friendly throughout.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2013,4,great place.,"This is a lovely place to stay , the staff is helpful and nice. The room was nice and the bed comfortable. The only problem seems to be Morocco when it rains a lot the bathrooms seems to stink a bit , we ran in to this smell all the time in Morroco. Breakfast is lovely. the Riad is located down a few lanes in the Medina, so you have to get your luggage down there , you can ring the Riad and they well come help you. Rabat is pretty safe and we never felt unsafe walking back in the evenings.the only thing that I can complain about is the really annoying music they stream all evening,",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2013,4,"Great properity, hospitality could be better","Riad Kalaa must be one of the nicest riads in Rabat (we spent only one night in Rabat, so we have only seen this one). It is a 'wow' place when you enter. What a tranquil, beautiful patio! The room (we stayed at La Favorite) was nice but a bit dark - but that is the case in many riad rooms. This riad is located in the medina, just five minutes walking from the Kasbah des Oudaias (one of the town's sights) and the ocean. Kalaa has a nice little pool on the rooftop, but unfortunately it was a bit too cold for the time of the year to enjoy it - must be great in summer! Our only reason to score this place 'very good' and not 'excellent', is the hospitality (which was rather poor). The French lady who welcomed us was very friendly and helpful, as was the staff at the breakfast.…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2013,5,This place is really really good,"My wife and I only spent a single night at Riad Kalaa. It didn't disappoint. We booked the room of stars which was their best room. It was quite lovely. The entire Riad was pretty magic and that's where we would stay again if in Rabat. Still what I will remember most fondly is frankly one of the best meals in my life. Wow! Duck with caramilised apple. The wine was also good. You could take this for granted, but the staff were just lovely as well. If you stay here, you will not regret it. I had a massage for an hour. My wife's shout. Just lovely.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2013,5,Delightful riad with charm,"I usually rate a hotel by its towel. The thicker, fluffier and soft it is, the higher rating it will place in my book. If this rating is solely used on Riad Kalaa, the riad (which is similar to best and breakfast) would sit comfortably high up there with five stars establishments. But the towel alone is not only why I would rate this riad so highly. The entrance as you step into the big house welcomes you with warm lighting, the courtyard embraces you with soft music and the soft scent in the room seduces you. I stayed here during my wife's baby moon at Etoille suite. Tatiana, the manager greeted us warmly and took us to the room, up a flight of stair. The suite is really nice with local details along the wall and animal skin rugs and heated floor beneath your feet. The…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2013,5,Wonderful little riad,"This was our first experience of a riad - situated close to the old Kasbah. It was dark when we arrived and following a young man (who we had met only minutes previously) through narrow dimly-lit alleys was a trifle un-nerving. However on arrival at the riad and were very impressed with what we saw inside. We sat on the fringe of a beautiful dining area and were served a glass of wine while our booking was sorted. After being shown to our room and depositing our luggage, we enjoyed a lovely 3-course meal for a very reasonable price. Our room was on the top floor of the riad, comfortable, quite spacious with full bathroom and beautiful Moroccan decor. Staff were very friendly and helpful. We would certainly recommend this riad if you're staying in Rabat.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2013,5,One of our Moroccan favorites,"We stayed at Riad Kalaa the 2nd night of our 2 week Moroccan tour. I wish we had come here from the first night and had stayed 2 instead of one night. We stayed in a number of really nice riads during our trip, but this one stands out as a favorite. We received a warm welcome with tea and biscuits before being shown to our lovely rooms, all of which were on the ground floor. The atmosphere was very relaxing. I would love to return one day.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2012,4,Exotic Moroccan Retreat,"We started the first leg of our Moroccan journey in the capital, Rabat. My friend and I stayed in this gem of a riad for 3 nights in December 2012 (my apologies for the late review). But trust me, the experience of the Riad Kalaa remains fresh in one's mind. From the minute you step through the main door, you have that feeling of entering an exotic dream. The architectural design and attention to detail of this riad is quite remarkable. We stayed in one of the smaller rooms - Santal (Sandalwood) - nevertheless, it was very clean and comfortable and afforded us a restful stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. My only true disappointment would be that I didn't get to enjoy the hammam experience because it was not functioning on the day I had booked the 2-hour hammam &…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2012,5,Beautiful Riad,"Our only regret was not spending more time at this riad. Riad Kalaa is spacious, and our room was beautifully finished. Breakfast and dinner were served in the central covered courtyard, and the quality of the food was excellent. There were only two couples staying the night we were there so it was very quiet, but ideal to relax after a long flight. Thoroughly recommended.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2012,5,Beautiful place to spend a night...,"Stayed one night 15/12 ...warm welcome by Sanaa wit mint tea n homemade biscuits.

 November 2012,4,Great first impression,"Stayed here the first night of our trip. The courtyard was gorgeous! We loved the seating, the lighting, just everything. We stayed in La Favorite which had one bed on the main level and upstairs had a second bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom was really cool, except of course I hit my head on the entry decor (was a little low). We ate dinner here and it was just excellent. Breakfast was very filling and the staff was wonderful.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2012,5,Beautiful!,"We stayed here on our first night in Morocco. We arrived after dark and the Riad was beautiful and calming. The lights were dim and we loved the way the lace patterns of the lights reflected on the walls. (we might have been slightly delirious from travel). Our room was ""La Favorite"" on the first floor. It was wonderful. There is a full bed downstairs and a full bed and bath upstairs. The beds were very comfortable. The room was nicely decorated and the bathroom was lovely. The water was nice and hot and the pressure was excellent. Our guide phoned ahead and let the Riad know we would be eating dinner with them. The food was excellent. I had the chicken tangine. It was melt in your mouth good. Breakfast was also very good and included bread, crepes, hard boiled…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2012,5,Perfection,"This was simply the best way to round off a trip to Morocco. We just loved the relaxed style and ambience. It's not as grand or tiled or crafted as the riads we stayed at in Marrakech and Fes. But this place just oozed tranquilty. The relaxing courtyard, the stunning roof terrace, the ambient jazz in the background just all contributed to a soothing atmosphere. And the food's great too. The seafood menu is excellent. For a Moroccan riad the decor is almost minimalist but works effectively. It's also easy to find from Bab Latour just by the Kasbah and makes a great base for exploring the Medina and for walking on the corniche. Woud definitely stay here again.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2012,4,Our first Riad is a good one,"Riad Kalaa was the first riad we stayed at on our Moroccan trip and it was a good place to start. The owners and the staff are all of French origin and spoke varying degrees of English so my schoolboy french had to kick in . The riad is very stylish and well appointed . We had a room on to top of the building which mean't climbing up stairs (something we became accustom to in Morocco) but this wasn't a problem. We had dinner at the Riad which was fine and we were able to get a drink there too. Breakfast the next day was the typical breads with spreads,juice and coffee. All in all we were very haapy at the Riad Kalaa and recommend it for a stay",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2012,3,A Riad in Rabat,"We spent only one night in this Rabat riad. By definition, these are rich families' residences in the olden days located inside Moroccan medinas that have been lovingly restored. They're squarish, with rooms downstairs, then rooms way upstairs, then a roof deck where they might have a pool or dining terrace. In the middle is a cute courtyard with perhaps a fountain or several fruit trees and all-weather sofa sets and chairs with tables. But keep in mind - they are inside medinas which means two things - one, they are hard to find and-or get to from the main roads which means luggage handling may be a problem, and two, given the tendency back then to always keep the exterior simple so as not to attract attention or envy, the entrances are nondescript doors which you had to bang…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2012,5,The perfect base for exploring Rabat,"Our time at Riad Kalaa was definitely one of my favorites during the two weeks with our guide/driver from Morocco Overland around the country! The hospitality and helpfulness that the staff, especially the owner, The place is beautiful and one of our favorite Riad we stayed in Morocco. The highlight for us was a cooking lesson with chef, the hotel's chef. Unusually, were the only guests dinning that night so we had the intimate experience of learning first how to cook couscous properly and later exclusively enjoying the fruits of our labour.the chef she where charming, fun and very passionate about what she does. It was a treat to spend the afternoon with her. As we travelled through Morocco I fell more and more and deeper and deeper in love with the place and its people.…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 August 2012,5,Modern and tastefully decorated,"We were very happy to arrive in Rabat close to the beach. This riad was gorgeous - modern, relaxing, great dinner and breakfast, spacious and comfortable. The room we had was a little noisey so I would recommend staying in the back rooms. The pool area was beautiful - again a great place to escape the craziness of the city.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2012,5,Authentic yet modern riad,Behind the wooden door in the wall of a narrow street in the medina lies this charming riad. Our modern room on the ground floor opened into the beautiful mosaic-tiled courtyard with large comfortable couches with tables where you sat for meals.Very hospitable staff. Rooftop terrace for sunbathing with lovely pool. A wonderful place to stay!,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2012,4,Lovely Riad,"We stayed in the second branch of Riad Kalaa - ""Riad Arte"". Riad Kalaa is like one 5 star hotel, lovely decor, and very very well maintained. Riad Arte in which we actually stayed is also well maintained, Excellent decor, warm and cosy atmosphere. The host is very friendly, gave good guidance and help to find our way. Rooms are well decorated but small for the price. We felt it is a bit overpriced, but may be due to less raids available in Rabat. Breakfast was good. Host was really kind enough to understand the health issues my family member was facing and went out of way to arrange fruits for breakfast. Got a very family feel and good hospitality from the host.Thank you fro lovely hospitality.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2011,5,Good location in Rabat's Medina,"Stayed only one night here last year. Would liked to have had more time to explore Rabat’s’ Medina. This Riad has been beautifully restored, with an amazing courtyard. Lovely place to have breakfast and dinner. Located inside the medina in one of the smaller alleys, which all look the same when you’re trying to find your way back. Once inside the Riad is a peaceful oasis.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2012,5,We were in two branches of this riad,"Both spots were special, with great service, beautiful accommodations, and charming rooms. The dinner we had on our last night in Morocco was divine. I cannot emphasize enough how well we were treated: they remembered us from our initial stay, they helped us in every way. And there were two terraces.Exemplary.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat

 May 2012,3,Quite Disappointing,"Riad Kalaa was the biggest disappointment of my recent trip to Morocco. It definitely has some very good points and has much potential - however, the negative points at this time outweighed the positives. First, the positives: +The style is very nice, lighting is very good +Very nice rooftop deck with a pool +Room was very nicely appointed (linen, lights, ornaments) Now, for the negatives: -Staff was completely disinterested in us; we always would have to find them and ask for coffee or tea, they never stopped to ask if we needed anything -The time to answer the door could be several minutes (goes to the disinterested point above) -Language was an issue; although the website is available in English, very little is spoken by the staff and my French is nonexistent. …",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2012,5,"Beautiful and comfortable Riad in Rabat, Morocco","At Riad Kalaa we enjoyed the excellent food, staff, and convenient location. On our wonderful tour of Morocco with www.aroundmorocco.com we were fortunate to spend a lovely evening in Rabat and visit the exciting medina. The guides made us feel very comfortable.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2012,5,Excellent RIAD in the Heart of the MEDINA,"We got lost driving for 2 hours in our hired car and went around in circles because we spoke neither Arabic nor French and found it difficult to seek assistance from pedestrians. Finally, we hired a taxi whose driver spoke to the Hotel and within 10 minutes we got there. The RIAD is 200 mts inside the built-up area and away from the main road, so it is best to just get to the RABAT MEDINA or the PORT area and hire a TAXI which costs only 2 Euros. The location is terrific: near the edge of the Medina, so access is easy, and 5 minutes' walk to all interesting sights in this old part of the city. Our stay was in the small La Courtisane suite with a sitting area on the ground floor and the en-suite bedroom on the 2nd level. It is well proportioned and excellently designed…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2012,4,"Architecture and design very good, rest more average","There's not much to add to previous reviews. The Riad is a bit of a odd mix. Yes, it's a bit hard to find, but airport transfer worked well for me (at 20 Euro substantially more expensive than a regular taxi though), and they walked me to the hotel (it was night, and finding the place alone would not have worked). First impression was very good - wonderfully atmospheric place, with amazing attention to detail. It's all very ornamental, and beautifully lit. Received a welcome with some nice mint tea (free), and wifi was free and working quite well both in the courtyard and the room. First impression of the room (Musk, on the second floor) was also nice - equally beautifully designed. But at about 100 Euro a night without a phone, TV or minibar is a bit on the rich side.

 December 2011,4,Oasis in the heart of Rabat,"When staying at the medina you have to expect that 1- you're gonna have to walk through small convoluted streets... it's what makes the medina a medina! 2 - be ready to get lost, what you will find is quite amazing be open... 3 - there will be power cuts and such; 4 - people are extremely helpful, don't hesitate to engage them politely to ask for your way. With that you're ready to stay at the Riad Kalaa and you won't regret it. The whole place is charming, it's a delightful Riad, good for both tourists and business travelers who are fed up with the standard chain hotels. Food is excellent so don't miss out on the breakfast, rooms are just right in size and exquisitely decorated moroccan style. Service is great, and make sure to carve out some time to indulge in the traditional…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2011,3,"Nice Riad, helpful staff",We were probably spoiled staying in this Riad compared to the one we'd been in before (Riad Joya in Marrakech) but we were slightly disappointed by how tiny our room was - literally space for our bed and just a curtain separating the bathroom from the bedroom (warning - only go if you know your partner pretty well!!) But saying that it was very clean and nicely decorated and we found the staff very helpful. I'm sure some of the bigger rooms are lovely!,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 December 2011,4,"A lovely, quiet riad","I enjoyed my stay in this small, quiet riad and would certainly return. My room, one of the least expensive on offer, was simple in the best possible way: small, but perfectly proportioned, well designed and elegantly minimalist, while still distinctly Moroccan in style and with a particularly pleasant bathroom. For one person, it was ideal. Couples may want to consider a suite. Breakfasts are ample without being over the top: excellent jams, juice and fruit, yogurt, bread, cake, crepes. Wifi in the public areas is a useful plus and works very well. The location is terrific: near the edge of the Medina, so access is easy, and 5 minutes' walk to all manner of interesting sights in this old part of the city.

We hope to go back next year with more family.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 October 2011,4,Very charming; a few small criticisms,"The riad is gorgeous! beautifully appointed, lovely courtyard with plenty of space to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet. the staff is very friendly and helpful. The dinner and the breakfast were both delicious, with wonderful local delicacies and specialties. The wifi in the courtyard was a nice feature as well. Our suite was a duplex, with the bedroom and bathroom upstairs. The bathroom was truly gorgeous but had an odd design feature. The entrance from the bedroom to the bathroom was framed by a stone cornice molding that framed the doorway in such a way that anyone taller than 5 foot 6 inches (1 meter 67 centimeters) was bound to hit his/her head.

Booked on the internet and was (mistakenly) expecting an easy to find, typical Moroccan hotel with relatively easy access. Unfortunately, on arrival in Rabat late in the evening it took the taxi driver an hour to find the place so not ideal start. Finally, after speaking with some locals in the neighbourhood we did find it. Its in the Medina in Rabat (old quarters) with narrow alleyways to navigate left and right before you get there. Once having arrived at the front door (permanently locked) you need to ring the bell or bang the door to gain entry. If you're lucky someone will appear quickly.

 October 2011,5,A very quite and nice escape from the world,"We stayed at Riad Kalaa for our first night in Morocco, after a full day of sightseeing in Casablanca and Rabat. As we learned during our 13-day trip to Morocco put together by Aroundmorocco.com, riads are usually found in the medinas and by their outside looks they never betray their beauty once you enter them. The owner of the Riad personally met us, greeted with mint green tea; she could not have been more gracious. The accommodations (my friend and I had 2 rooms on the 2nd floor) were very pleasant. There is small pool where people were relaxing under the late October sun. The staff was accommodating and was ready to get us dinner after we changed our minds about dining in the city.

The Riad Kalaa is very well situated in the medina, but is a very peaceful place to stay. The sound of running water in the courtyard is very soothing and we were warmly welcomed with mint tea and cookies on arrival whilst we completed the registration formalities. Our room was well appointed, and an excellent dinner was served in the courtyard.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2011,4,Very good Riad,"We stayed at Riad Kalaa at the beginning and end of our trip to Morocco for a total of 4 nights in April-11. At various times there were 6-11 people as part of our group. Needless to say we occupied a variety of rooms at the Riad. Overall our stay was very good. The accommodations are deluxe, with typical Moroccan touches. very nice bar area, roof top deck, etc. Breakfasts were typical, albeit very good by Moroccan standards - fresh fruit, juice, yogurt, Moroccan pancakes, breads, strong coffee, etc. Rooms were somewhat expensive for Rabat but the experience compares favorably to some of the nicest Riads in Marrakech. So good value when compared to other cities. Staff was friendly and helpful. I reserved quite a bit ahead and made a variety of room; date changes. Riad staff…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat

 December 2010,5,Gorgeous Riad,"This was the first riad we stayed in on our trip to Morocco. We were very impressed by the pleasant, calm, relaxing feeling we felt when we entered the riad. After going through through the mazes of a relatively quiet part of the Rabat medina, we were greeted by a woman (I think she was French and might have been the owner) who treated us very nicely. She was so polite and allowed us to pick which room we wanted to stay in because the riad was not completely filled. Before picking which room we wanted, we were served cookies and mint tea which was nice after a whole afternoon of touring Rabat. I still couldn't get over the mellow feeling inside the riad. The decor around the courtyard was nicely arranged with comfortable furniture to sit on. We picked a room that was on a…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2011,5,"Lovely riad, gracious service","Our family of 4 arrived very late at Riad Kalaa -- around 11 pm -- so we assumed that they could not provide dinner (since they had other guests as well). But the staff was thoroughly gracious and provided a *fabulous* array of ""salad,"" consisting of wonderfully prepared beets, eggplant, fresh breads, potatoes, and other great dishes along with omelettes -- dinner for royalty, as far as we were concerned. The room was very pretty and quiet (since we slept in a bit), tucked away down those narrow alleys in the medina. We met another guest at breakfast who said this is *always* his preferred place to stay in Rabat. We were sad that we didn't get a chance to visit the pool.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat

 February 2011,5,Good location and friendly staff,The Riad Kalaa has very good location inside of the Medina. The Medina of Rabat is much more silent in compare to Marakesh. But still it was a big experience to stay there. The Riad itself was very nice place with wonderful decorated rooms. There were great attention shown to all the details in the room.

Since we arrived unexpectedly late after a long flight and drive from Casablanca (past 10 pm), our tour guide called for us and arranged a late dinner for us at the riad. The staff stayed late and cooked us a delicious tagine dinner and did not rush us at all. The room was stocked with the most amenities that we had among any hotels we stayed at in Morocco.

Upon entering the riad we didn't get a greeting as the lady didn't speak english and we had to stand around for nearly 10 minutes before the only english speaking person arranged for us to go to our room. The new design and style of the courtyard area is very nice, the rooms are split level but very nice inside. The bed was comfortable and shower also good.

 October 2010,3,Comfortable Riad close to everything,We recently stayed at Riad Kalaa for one night in early October. We found the Riad to be comfortable and clean. We had a double room and that was sufficient for one night. A great shower with lots of hot water and good water pressure. We tried to check in about 1pm to be told that check in wasn't until 1.30pm. Whilst we waited they offered us a very nice fresh orange juice. In the afternoon they obliged and made us a light lunch of chicken brochette even though the kitchen was closed. They also have beer! For dinner we ate at a nearby restaurant called Dinarjat. It was superb and probably some of the best food that we have had in Morocco during our three weeks.

A very good swimming pool and lots of sun terraces. A magical courtyard for evening dining. Excellent service from the staff. Only suggestion is for us more mature travellers - a handrail on the first flight of steps would be helpful. Easy walk to the sights and into the city through the Souk.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2010,1,Disco Riad,"We had a terrible experience at this riad. We chose it because it appeared to offer serenity, calm, and elegance in the heart of the medina. The night of our stay, the owners decided to turn the riad into a nightclub by throwing a loud and boisterous party for 30-40 of their friends on the rooftop terrace. From 7 pm onward, the entire riad pulsated and reverberated with rock music, with groups of people – who weren’t guests – coming and going and totally disrupting our experience as guests. The ruckus continued into the wee hours of the morning. The owners spared no expense – three live DJs, massive speakers and subwoofers, dancing and bottomless alcohol– which utterly destroyed our riad experience.

 July 2010,5,The best option for character in Rabat,I found the recent review below quite interesting as they had obviously had a similar tour around Morocco as ourselves. We had also stayed in top end riads (please see my other reviews) and enjoyed some wonderful surroundings. Judged against these then I can see how the Riad Kalaa might not fare as favourably. However tourism in Rabat is nowhere near as developed as the other major cities & the riad reflects this. The building itself is compact for a riad despite actually having 3 floors but it has been recently renovated to a very high standard with all the decor feeling clean fresh & new. Again in contrast to the reviewer below our room was bright & airy although quite small in comparison to elsewhere. It was located on the top terrace but this meant there were dual aspect…,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2010,3,Doesn't live up to the hype on trip advisor or its website,"We arrived at the Riad Kalaa around 5 PM after traveling from Fes. I had emailed them the previous day, asking if they could send someone to the train station to pick us up since the Kalaa is in the Medina and I had read it was difficult to find the first time. There were no directions on their website, other than a simple map that is meaningless to someone who has never been there before. So I was hoping we could be picked up. No one replied, though I checked my email at the train station in Rabat when we arrived at 4 PM. Fortunately, a thoughtful trip advisor reviewer had written up very detailed directions that I recorded, so we were able to direct a taxi driver to the place where we could be dropped off. Since cars aren’t allowed in the Medina, we walked the rest of…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat

We had also dinner in the patio (so while baby is sleeping, very very handy, no babysitter needed). Aisha and Sanaa are very helpful (even arranged lunch twice for our daughter and did not even charge it). Sometimes noise till a bit late in the evening, but not really bothering me.

It can be a bit tricky to find at first but don't hesitate to ask the locals once you are inside the medina. They are very helpful!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2010,4,Very nice indeed,Really lovely place. Pool is great and rooms are delightful. As with all riads they are narrow and tall but beautifully decorated. The hotel services here are very ood. Wine is expensive nut the food was excellent and reasonable value. Location is great too. Near Kasbah and souks of Rabat (such as they are). Can be a bit noisy on the ground floor as the dining area is rght outside the door but certainly caused no problems for us. Rabat was a bit of a shock after Fez but we soon got accustomed to it and would certainly recommend it as a place to visit and Riad Kalaa as a place to stay.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 May 2010,5,Paradise! I would go back to Rabat just to stay here.,"This riad is absolutely fantastic. The pool on the roof is incredible, and the renovation/decoration is unbelievable. I was so impressed. I stayed there as a solo female traveler -- which I would NOT recommend by any means in Morocco -- so I especially appreciated having a nice place to come back to in the evenings. It is not safe to be out once the sun goes down, so spending time in the total safety and peacefulness of this riad is wonderful. Many tourists overlook Rabat, but it was really the only town in Morocco where I felt relatively safe and wasn't hassled constantly (although there were a couple of bad incidents.) If I had to go back to Morocco alone, I would go only to Rabat, and stay here!",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2010,5,Fantastic riad hidden in the medina,"Hidden in a small street inside the medina of Rabat, this riad has been amazingly restored, offering all modern amenities in a classic moroccan riad. We had the 'Courtisane' suite featuring a mezzanine bedroom and lovely bathroom with excellent body products. Dining in the patio was a nice romantic experience (the staff went out of their way to prepare something for us as we went late without reservation). My wife gave the spa a try and couldn't find words to describe the amazing treatment when she went back ! Breakfast was OK, nothing breathtaking, but good nonetheless. The location in the medina is great for visiting not only the old medina, but also the Oudaïa's kasbah. Getting to the modern part of the city by taxi is fast and very cheap.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat

On arrival we were greeted warmly and ushered through a dark hallway into the beautiful courtyard/patio which took our breath away with its arches, palm trees and intricate plasterwork. The riad has been very substantially restored, possibly completely rebuilt, but the interior designer is to be congratulated on the excellent taste exhibited in everything from cushions to lanterns and brass door fittings. We were offered mint tea (English black tea is also available) and discussed the menu for dinner (250 dirhams per person). Dinner is optional and the 3 course menu du jour is posted on the wall just inside the office. This comprises a first course with a selection of five dishes, a…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2010,5,Perfect haven in Rabat's Medina,"I stayed at the Riad one night only, and wish I had stayed longer. I was picked up at the airport by the driver, which is a good thing if you have been at the Rabat's airport (far, no transport, no help). The Riad is beautiful, without over the top. It looks fancy and traditional, without giving guests the impression that Morocco exploded onto the walls. The room - off the main courtyard - was beautiful, large and ultra comfortable. The bathroom was so amazing I took what is close to the longest shower I my life. Staff is friendly, casual yet responsive. I liked the fact that the Riad was free to roam, even in the evening, which felt really amazing. The roof-top is awesome, especially when you are alone up there. Location wise, it is top notch. Very close to bab lalou, which is…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2010,4,A solid choice in the Rabat Medina,"Riad Kalaa was our first stop in Morocca, after traveling all night. It was calm and restful, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The room was a decent size, and quiet (except for the rain pouring on the roof--not their fault!). The included breakfast was well prepared and prompt. The Riad is on one of the smaller alleys in the medina, and you may need a guide to get there the first time. It was disappointing that the Riad couldn't recommend a guide who spoke English, but all else met our expectations.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 January 2010,5,A very nice place to stay,"It is hard to think of anything to complain about, other than there were no English language channels on the TV. It is a beautiful facility in the medina only a few blocks from the shopping area, the ocean, Kasbah des Oudaias, and the new riverfront promenade. You can easily walk to Le Tour Hassan and Mausoleum of Mohanned V, but it is a bit too far to walk to Chellah. It is a short taxi ride to the train station. We stayed in the Toureg suite which has a great bathroom and the best water pressure we found in Morocco. There is a computer available for guest use. Importantly, and rarely for riads in Morocco, it was warm in the riad in January, even in the courtyard. There is a nice rooftop terrace with a small pool. There is a private hammam and spa where my wife spent…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2009,4,Gorgeous Riad - with attention to detail...,"A friend and I just returned from a 16 day tour of Morocco with aroundmorocco tours, and we stayed at Riad Kalaa on our first evening. What a beautiful and tranquil place! Attention to detail was evident and the service was very good also. Dinner was yummy. I would have happily stayed an extra night or two, but we needed to move on to adequately cover all the sights in our itnerary. I have no problem in highly recommending this place.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 November 2009,3,Fell short of expectations.,"Lots of reviews posted here are over the top. Riad Kalaa is fine but not great. My room off the main courtyard was noisy and rather dark. The Moroccan sense of style was in full evidence and this was rather nice. They serve the best yogurt in the world at breakfast, and the rooftop terraces are very pleasant. The hotel failed to honor my appointment for a massage and hammam treatment - somehow that reservation just went away. The staff was rather indifferent to my needs.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 September 2009,5,A Really Great Experience,"Riad Kalaa is located inside the medina, giving you the true feel of living in a riad. Although for the first timer, you can get seriously lost in the maze of the medina trying to find the hotel. I had to draw a small map for myself the first morning I ventured out, so I would know how to get back (there are no maps of how to get in and out - Riad Kalaa should really consider having some made for their customers). But I'm not complaining - once I got the lay of the land, it was actually very cool staying in the medina. Another potential problem - when I took the petit taxis, none of the drivers had a clue what/where Riad Kalaa was. Getting from the train station to the Riad was a disaster - I would strongly advise getting in touch with Riad Kalaa before arriving to see if…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 July 2009,5,Fantastically redone riad close to the edge of the medina,"Stayed here for several nights for business as the usual hotels were booked and at least the Riad offered wifi. I have to say, I'm looking forward to going back and staying here again! Staff were fabulous, especially Tariq who picked me up in the middle of the night from Casa airport and was always helpful when I had questions etc. I stayed in two different rooms -- one with AC that wasn't functioning very well, the other with one that did which was definitely needed as Rabat had a heatwave when I was there. The rooms themselves are lovely. Definitely do dinner here -- I did twice and it was fantastic both times. Very memorable sitting in the courtyard sipping a glass of vino and having a beautifully prepared meal. Would have been even lovelier had I been with my hubbie as…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 June 2009,5,Riad Kalaa is the place to relax and experience the essence of tranquility,"Service - staff were very friendly, helpful and attentative to our needs. Our meals were prepared in a timely maner at our request and very well presented. Room - we stayed in the 'room of the stars' which was luxurious and tastefuly decorated with many interesting features and detail. Room service was excellent. Standards of cleanliness and hygiene were high. It was particularly nice to relax in our aircon room, while watching TV /DVD's in English! Location & Amenities - Hotel building is visually deceptive from the outside, but upon entry, you walk straight into a unique world of paradise & tranquility...it's breathtaking! Riad Kalaa is very close to the beach and tourist attractions. Cab/taxi fares are very reasonable and we were able to get around easily. Food - breakfast…",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2009,5,great for short romantic trip to Rabat,"Not exactly what I was looking for, for a 2 week business trip. Since I booked one day before arrival, this was one of few available hotels. But when I arrived, I knew I wouldn't be sorry. And I wasn't. The hotel has all the advantages of a riad. Beautifully decorated, situated in a quiet street in medina, close to the kasbah. And the staff is just great. One really gets the feeling he's taken care of - unlike in big impersonal chain-hotels. The price is a bit higher, but here the money is really well spent.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 April 2009,5,Beautiful riad in Rabat,We stayed for 1 night in riad Kalaa in Rabat. The riad itself is beautiful. Very nicely restored and with stylish decoration. At first we were not happy to find out we would not have the possibility to eat in the riad that evening. It was Sunday and they just had a wedding the day before. We explained that we could not go out for dinner with the baby. The manager said she would organise some food for us. We did not expect much but we got a lovely dinner. Very good food and very friendly service. The location of the riad is very good and the rooms are nice. Beautiful roof terrace with swimming pool. Nice and helpful staff.,Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2009,5,Elegant and full-service,"Our stay at Riad Kalaa was short, but comfortable. The room was immaculate, the food was perfectly fresh and hot, the staff was very discrete. In short, it is a perfect upscale place to stay, no complaints.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2009,5,Marvellous riad extremely well renovated in an authentic style,"Coming from the highway I found my peace in this calm and beautifull place imidst of the medina of Rabat. I intended to stay one night, but finally I stayed three days. My eyes were caught by lovely details arranged by the excessive aesthetic style of the owner David and my mind was tuned by wonderfull recommendations of Solange the house-manager concerning trips to the chellah, to music-bars and elsewhere. And my body got in touch with ideas of wellness climbing up the roof where a stylish swimmingpool invites to stay.......",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 March 2009,5,Beautiful and luxurious,"This riad was recently renovated and opened. It is beautiful and their attention to detail is impeccable. The courtyard garden is beautiful and relaxing. The rooms are gorgeous. The food is great. From the tea service to the roof lounge to the carving on the underside of ceiling beams, it is tasteful and wonderful. It really felt like luxury. We even came back to Rabat an extra night just to stay at Riad Kalaa again. And the plumbing is great. I cannot stress how rare this is in Morocco. Not only is there a western style bathtub big enough for two, but there is water pressure and a fast drain.",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
 February 2009,4,Thousand-and-one-night,"We enjoyed our stay at Riad Kalaa very much. Kalaa is recently restored, and looks fabulous. A mix of the ancient magic, with modern comfort. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. Good and friendly service. Great breakfast in the sun on the rooftop terasse. Near the Kashbah in the Medina. The less exclusive rooms are also very nice. We had the Tourareg room. Stan & Genevieve",Riad_Kalaa,Rabat
