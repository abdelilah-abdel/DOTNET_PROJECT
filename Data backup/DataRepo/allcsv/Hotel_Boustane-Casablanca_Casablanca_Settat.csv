 August 2021,1,Horrible,"It was the dirtiest Hotel i ever seen in my life, the smell was just horrible in the room and bathroom smells worst my bed sheet was full of spam & food I don't advice any one to try it + the price is not the same as the put online you can see the towel condition in the pic",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,hotelName,city
 November 2019,3,Stayed for one night,"Stayed here for one night when the other hotel booked was not found on the road! Average place with recommended renovation, only good thing is proximity to the Train Station. Owner was good - gave me some useful information by doing some research in internet which I had some issues to navigate due to language.",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,3,Not that bad of an experience,"Sooo... my friend booked our stay here because it was close to the train station (Casa Voyagers) and we would only be there one night. I was slightly terrified at first after reading reviews but in all honesty my experience wasn't that bad. There are no elevators and you will have to lug whatever you have up slightly narrow stairs. The check-in area is also very narrow. It's beautiful though. I mean I was surprised at how good looking it was in person. The room was clean. The beds were broken but we could sleep on them. The sheets were clean even if the extra blankets were not. The bathroom was awkward (especially the shower) but clean. They provided us with hand soap, toilet paper and towels. The WiFi was non-existent. I mean even though they showed us which was…",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,1,Friendly staff but the hotel is in great need of repair,"I needed a place to stay in at Casablanca, and I found this one to be nearest the bus station and the Casa Voyageur train station. I never read reviews because I was in a hurry, and I was expecting it will be the same or even better than the riads/hostels I stayed in Morocco. To my disappointment, there's no aircon so you have to open the window for air. The toilet is dirty, and the overall interior is just in bad condition.",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,2,in need of repair,"Hotel Boustance is very old but only a few mins walk from Casa Voyageurs railway station as well as close to a tram station and it is very cheap. It is old and the bed sheets are not clean and you can easily find hair on them. There is no towels or toilet rolls in the room.The washing basin is leaking such that you will always need to step on a pool of water and the water tap can easily get the whole body wet because of malfunctioning. The toilet is leaking such that you can hear water running the whole night.There is a little balcony but the door cannot be locked which means that anyone can easily climb in from outside as houses are very close to each other. But, for such a low price and the location, I have no complaint. The staff are ok and the Wifi works well. I cannot…",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,2,Very helpful and friendly staff but poor conditions,"Good location if you are planning to take the train, close to the Casa-Voyageurs railway station and not so far from the Hassan II Mosque, around 10 min by/ 4 euros. The man from the desk, which I suppose was the owner was very nice, helpful and friendly, 5 stars for him. Room wasn't so bad but the bathroom looked like it wasn't cleaned for a while. No chance to get a shower and of course after seeing that we start to question the room cleanliness. Hopefully, things will get better.",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,1,A total disaster,"These guys shouldn't be in the hotel business. Our reservation was cancelled on the day we planned to arrive, with notification sent when we were on the plane. We woke up a receptionist (not sure if he was drunk but he looked like) only to hear that our room was given to somebody else - and they were surprised that we were upset. Avoid this place!",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,3,Close to tramway and train station,"After reading other reviews I was wary of this place but decided to check it out. The poor reviews seem very overstated. The hotel is three blocks and very easy walking distance from the train station. It is reasonably priced. The rooms have no heating or cooling but have high ceiings and are huge. Our room had a queen size bed and a double bed as well as a sofa. The TV was old but the staff came twice to personally tune the TV to the only English cable channel for us. The receptionist was always helpful and cheerful. The wifi was fast and handled two devices at once in our room. The plumbing worked well with great hot showers. The decor is old and mismatched but the sheets were very clean and in good condition, the towels were OK. We found the hotel quiet and had a great nights…",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,3,soldiers hotel,"I spent a full week in this hotel, which gave me the opportunity to try in full its capacity to accomodate travelers in search for a budget hotel.One cannot deny the easy location near the train station and the tramway which cross casa from one side to the other, right by the oceanic shore. Every floor has an independent wifi router which works perfectly for the connection inside the rooms. The place is a come and go of people, but not so noisy and you can rest ok, accepting the cleanness standard of such old hotel, which probably it has not changed mattress in the rooms from the day of inauguration, but if you are smell fetishist, you may like that particular nitrite odor coming from beneath the bed sheets, which btw they are usually fresh washed and clean. Unfortunately the…",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,1,"Horrible ! Dirty, cold, and very noisy Hotel, rude staff as well ( To be Avoided)","Very dirty room ( found left - overs of food in the room ) , very dirty blanket and bed , rude staff , no soap , shower not working , very old TV , very dete- riorated room condition , noisy hotel , dirty restroom , no heating system, no towel in the room.",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,1,Disaster,"The worst hotel I've ever been in. Dirty, neglected, linen looked like used many times before. Pictures on booking.com must have been taken 20 years ago or photoshoped by a master. Nothing looks like on these pics. Main reason why we booked it was it is near train station, but believe me, if i should go to there again i'd rather book hotel anywhere else and pay a taxi to train station.",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,3,Mouldy hotel close to Casa Voyageurs train station,"The location is the only thing that mattered when I stayed there. I had a good sleep though. Close the windows and/or use earplugs. You are in Casablanca, it is noisy. The room was large but mouldy (ceiling, bathroom). Water was hot though. I did not have any breakfast.",Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2016,2,Cold rooms but close to Gare du Train of Casa Voyageurs,I was not expecting something of 4 or 5 star hotels but for the price you got what you paid. Casablanca is not that cheap city to enjoy Marocco but this place is the cheapest option for one night stay and walking distance from Gare du Train. However the man in the front reception doesnt speak English but he does understand well. The rooms are very cold and not the cleanest one... but okay for one night stay.,Hotel_Boustane-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Boustane,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
