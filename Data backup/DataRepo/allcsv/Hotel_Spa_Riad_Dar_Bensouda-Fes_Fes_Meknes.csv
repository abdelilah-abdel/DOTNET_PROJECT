We followed recommendations from the staff and had an exceptional your with Mohammed, such a learned and humble man, hammam and massage at the hotel (spiritual) and so much more. Not once did we feel hassled. Our comfort and the fullness of our stay was tantamount to the Riad team. They, the Riad and Fes have captured our hearts.

 August 2022,5,Beautiful Riad with great service,"Stayed at Riad Dar Bensouda for 2 nights during our tour of Morocco. What a wonderful experience.

 August 2022,1,HORRIBLE….DON’T STAY HERE,"We booked two rooms to stay in the hotel in April 2022 for our visit to Fes in August 2022. The night before we were supposed to arrive, we received notification that the hotel was overbooked and our reservations had been CANCELED. THIS WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE WE WERE DUE TO ARRIVE. We had no other hotel and we were traveling to Morocco for the first time from the US. We knew no one and had to scramble to find another hotel at the last minute. Horrible horrible horrible experience and I suggest that you do not make reservations to stay here as they apparently mean nothing. The Hotel Sahari on the other hand was spectacular and they accommodated us last minute. It was a far superior hotel and absolutely beautiful. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Sahari and avoid this one at all…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 July 2022,5,Amazing 3 days in Morocco,We had amazing 3 days here. Almost 400 year old building is well kept and maintained. The manager Yassin was very helpful and upgraded our room to the higher end one. The waiter gave us superb service. It was as if you were staying at a museum. The rooftop was another nice place to pass the evening. Keep in mind that there is no fridge or tv. But you can always get a cold water from the restaurant.

Rooms again absolutely beautiful, with very comfortable bed (we had one of the big ones, and it was indeed huge!). The breakfast was delicious and their dinner also very tasty/large portions (although you can find cheaper in the medina, but that is taking the risk of getting lost on the way back, so depends on how comfortable you are navigating the Fes medina). The presence of a pool was a big plus. We also got the full body massage there and recommend it! The only shortcoming to our stay was the non existent WiFi and network connection in our room, so we had to get close to the door/outside of the room to get any signal.

The staff attended to our every need, arranging help getting us and our luggage through the mazes, preparing wonderful meals and massages on-site, connecting us with a tour guide for the day trip to Volubilis (worth the trip!) and attending to our younger daughter when she wasn’t feeling great.

The rooftop had the most electric atmosphere but was simultaneously bathed in peace. Every member of staff was a delight to meet, talk to and befriend. The highest compliments must go to manager Yazid and staff members Ibrahim and Aziz, what we would have done without their 24/7 help, friendship and warmth. I genuinely miss them all and my heart aches now that I have left the Riad behind. The rooms were exquisite and indulgent, with a bathroom that had the most relaxing shower and perfect temperature.

The Wifi is also fast, which was helpful to do work and conduct video conferences. Breakfast was bountiful and had a great deal of variety. The restaurant in the hotel was okay, had better food at the plethora of restaurants in the area. I would recommend the Ruined Garden for sure. We also went outside the hotel for a guide. It was much more inexpensive, and the quality was great. They will tell you a party line of official guides versus unofficial, but it honestly seems like a ploy to justify paying more as the more informal tourist economy of the area works largely on kickbacks and supplying local businesses with cash flush tourists.

Lounge chairs in the main area are spotted, light colored rugs are spotted and look soiled and even some pottery serving dishes are cracked, This Riad has so much potential so sad it’s not being looked after.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,Astounding Delight - Stepping Back in Time or Out of Time,"When our driver stopped at a Meeting Point to inform the hotel of our arrival, I had no idea what to expect. And not knowing what to expect continued to be my experience. Next a person from the hotel met us with a large cart to carry our luggage and we began to follow him through a maze of twists and turns. Darkness was broken up along our way with various lights as we made our way past others who all seemed quite familiar with the route. Delight continued as we stepped through a large wooden door into another time. The management and staff were all very welcoming and friendly. The surroundings were elegant and quite comfortable. It is definitely a place to soak up in all ways - spa included. My only regret is we did not stay longer.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,My special birthday trip to Morocco,"My first visit to Fes didn't disappoint... Everything from the well-cared-for stay in Riad Dar Bensouda, the lovely meals in the dining room, to my pampered spa treatment with Fatima in the cosy spa area. All the staff was attentive and patient; they were available whenever I needed them but never intrusive. The whole place felt like home. Our room was on the top floor so at times it seemed like the vast open rooftop was just for me, when I happened to be there completely alone. I especially loved being there when the calls to prayer from nearby mosques were made. The sense of peace and tranquility felt when the only sounds I heard came from the mosques and the gentle birds' murmurations.

 December 2019,5,Great hotel in middle of Medina,"This is a beautiful Riad in the middle of the Medina.

Those who will not push themselves a little bit to find a hidden gem in the old city, or feel curious to live a couple of days without being surrounded by electronic devices everywhere. Furthermore, it needs a person who appreciate the glory of the past, the genuine beauty of antiques and doesn’t consider such charm as rustic metal or scaly wood. This dar was belonged to a well respected Imam, Ahmed bensoudeh, a prestigious man, with well known teaching religion classes.

 December 2019,5,Kind staff! Great place!!,"Thank you Houda (manager) and all staff of Dar Bensouda. We came as first time tourists in Morocco and stayed in the most authentic place of Fes - the old Medina walled city. It was such a phenomenal experience. We felt a little unsafe at times because of the endless haggling, BUT Houda with her distinguished kindness and honesty helped us with all sorts of guidance. We spent two nights in Fes and will be back to try and see the Blue city...will definitely be back! Details of how Houda helped us: 1. We found a tour guide on our without telling her. We left to tour the old Medina with the guide. 2. After two hours of touring the old Medina, the tour guide took us to see the tannery.

 December 2019,5,Chic and Cheerful Oasis in the Middle of Fez Medina,"We had a great stay for two nights at Dar Bensouda. The riad is located smack dab in the middle of the historic heart (medina) of Fez. The photos are 100% accurate-the place is gorgeously restored. We had a wonderful room right on the first floor and it was peaceful and airy. The Riad has wonderful,energetic staff-who were always professional and attentive. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed very comfortable. The pool and lounging floor are chic and well maintained. Restaurant has a menu of Moroccan classics at affordable prices. One piece of advice-don't try and navigate the Fez medina by yourself-its and utterly confusing maze of streets and alleyways. I can not imagine how people arrive without a guide or porter.

There was a well stocked breakfast buffet with local food, and omelettes cooked to order. We had several meals in the restaurant. I particularly liked the 5 Moroccan salads.

A highlight of my trip was sitting in the courtyard of the oldest house and watching the sky change color (if you know anything about Turrell's Skyspaces--Moroccan courtyard houses are basically those, and the proportions of this house are perfect for the light show). I also appreciate that while the setting is very traditional, it is not heavily ornamented -- the rooms are actually quite simple and spare. It's a nice rest for your eyes at the end of the day.

Our room was simply yet beautifully decorated. The rooftop terrace gave stunning views of the medina and Fes. Breakfast consisted of a buffet - delicious flatbreads with local cheese, jams, pastries, cucumbers, cakes . Amazing! The staff couldn’t do enough for us. We’d seen some worrying reviews about the medina so requested a guide through the hotel which they organised immediately.

The new room was even better but the air conditioner was not working and we asked if they could fix it, a guy came by did nothing and left with the air conditioner still broken.

We appreciated the renovation works which put a sober and elegant touch to the already fantastic structure. The courtyard in the back is an absolute dream and I will miss having tea with biscuits there for sure. We booked a deluxe suite which was the best place to have some rest escaping the Médina.

No key lock for doors but rather a sliding latch which you secured with a padlock Only a padlock and key when leaving the room. Never seen this before.

 October 2019,5,Great place to stay,Stayed at the Riad Dar Bensouda in Fez and found it to be a great place. The rooms are large by most Riad standards and there is a restaurant in the Riad as well as a fantastic rooftop area. The rooms are clean and well maintained and well laid out with ample room. You do need a local guide to direct you in and out of the place as the medina is like a rabbit warren and very easy to get lost. The staff are fantastic and make you feel at home. The food in the restaurant/dining room is very good indeed. The views (especially at night) from the rooftop are simply amazing and you can easily spend quite a few hours there relaxing.

Giving you the experience of a traditional moroccan home with modern facilities. It was great. The rooms are so spacious and the entire place has so many nook and corners to sit, relax, chill, read a book. The sunset from the terrace was beautiful.

The staff were very good, the rooms were very clean, well appointed and comfortable. Breakfast and Dinner were satisfactory, if not as good as we experienced elsewhere on our trip. Located deep into the Medina, it is an ideal base from which to explore. However, cars can only be parked outside the Medina, and it was a near 10 mins walk - with cases - from the public car park, and would have been almost impossible to find had it not been for the help of a Guide we happened by chance to meet when parking. In hindsight, we should have liaised with Reception beforehand for their own Porters to meet us on arrival in the car park to take our cases and direct us to the Riad.

Our room was beautiful and spacious and gave out onto a gorgeous atrium with flowers and birds galore. One flight up was the common area/dining area/ pool area. It just gave us such a sense of peace and calm to be welcomed into this home-like atmosphere.

It takes about an hour to get to the Riad from the airport. Our room was huge with double height ceilings and a huge door with a smaller opening for convenience.

 July 2019,5,Oasis of peace and calm in Fes,"Just returned from a week-long stay in July with my wife and two teenage children at this Riad in Fes. We had a very comfortable, safe and pleasant stay. It is a beautiful, peaceful, place with the facilities of a relatively large Riad. A nice breakfast was served each day. We also ate lunch and dinner at the Riad most days, and the quality of food was generally very good. On one or two occasions our first menu choice was not available but there were always alternative choices available. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the cookery lesson she took at the Riad and my children loved the small swimming pool and large roof terrace with panoramic views of the Medina. We enjoyed use of a large family suite with two adjoining bedrooms for most of our stay, which opened out into a lovely…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2019,5,Honestly one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at!,"Had a terrific experience here. The Riad itself is breathtaking and a shining example of Moroccan interior design. The staff was welcoming and spoke English (and French) very well. The manager here does an impeccable job. We were especially grateful to have been warned of scams to look out for. We were also able to book excursions and a licensed tour guide through the hotel. The food is good and decently priced. The only minor issue we had was that the internet occasionally stopped working. Overall, absolutely recommend staying here!",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

This was my first time to be in Morocco and there were so many unexpected things happened, but staff were so kindly and friendly helped us. (Announcing the airport transfer in advance, showing us where to go in Fes, preparing check-out even though we left early like 2am!!) Thank to them, we enjoyed staying in Fes ☺️ The location was difficult to find but highly recommended to stay this lovely place!! And we also recommend to eat at the restaurant for dinner.

The roof terrace also has an amazing view of Fes, and you can watch the sunset lying on the veranda. The food offered in the riad was incredible too- breakfasts were a proper spread, and for dinner we had a beautiful tagine and couscous which were delicious. Also excellent location (just hidden away from the craziness but not too difficult to find).

The food was delicious; we ended up taking all of our dinners there. The roof terrace is beautiful and huge with a great view of Fes around you; we actually didn't find a better vantage point in Fes than the roof of our Riad.

 May 2019,5,A wonderful escape in the heart of the Medina,"We stayed for 2 nights in 2 rooms as a family of 5. The riad is beautifully restored with little pockets of tranquility throughout. Breakfast was good - we didn't try the evening meals. Our rooms were quite different, but both good in their own way. Our teenagers shared a twin room which was very cosy and had a small window whereas our double room + extra bed was huge with massive windows and lots of light.

Ambience: It is an unassuming door in the middle of the Medina which leads to the absolutely beautiful spacious interiors of a restored historic mansion. Has a rooftop with great views. Rooms: The first night we were in a room which was loud and required a set of stairs to get to the bathroom. They switched us to a big, private, magnificent room the following two nights. Decor and design was perfection- One of our favorite rooms we stayed in all of Morocco. Service: A young, hard working man named Jamal manages the entire operation and is very friendly and helpful.

 March 2019,5,Ancient Fez with modern comfort,"Having now stayed in this seventeenth-century Riad, the Dar Bensouda in Fez, which I visited in March this year (2019), I can't imagine ever going to a conventional hotel in the city. The Riad has eighteen rooms, so is relatively large by comparison with its rivals in Fez, and I was told that the owner has bought another dilapidated Riad next door which he plans to restore and use to extend the Dar Bensouda. When this happens it should offer the character of a Riad with even more of the advantages of a hotel, and it could dominate the accommodation on offer in the Medina. The Riad Dar Bensouda is an extraordinary and historic building that's been beautifully converted into modern accommodation without compromising its character, so that the old and the not so old blend together…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2019,5,Nice stay,"Located down a winding alleyway with an unassuming door. This is a small hotel composed of a couple of riads all interconnected. Jamal at the front desk is great. Actually, everybody working there was very nice and accommodating. One courtyard was less elaborate with a pool. The other was the one they show in the pictures; more intricate tile work with a star shaped fountain in the floor. Our room was very clean and the bathroom looked brand new. We booked a junior suite which had plenty of room. However, the bathroom was up a flight of steps. So if you get up a lot in the middle of the night, you may want to consider asking about the floorplan.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

This beautiful riad is located in the center of the medina so arrange for a guide to meet you outside the medina and lead you in. Once inside you will be inside a gorgeous, traditional riad. Our rooms were in the old part of the riad and were magnificently Moroccan. The hotel is also very helpful in suggesting restaurants to try and in arranging activities. Breakfast is quite traditional Moroccan food but you can ask for an omelet or eggs cooked anyway, and the orange juice is as good as it gets. I also highly recommend the Riad's restaurant for dinner: we had one of the best lamb tagines for our whole trip there.

Lovely pool (for cooling off, not really for swimming) but the weather was too cool for me to use it. My daughter used the spa and said she had a very good massage.

 December 2018,5,Excellent hotel in the heart of the medina,"The hotel is located quite in the middle of the old medina of Fes. From there it is possible to reach the most important places of the medina (such as the tannery) in a few minutes. Once you find the entrance of the hotel (it is not so easy to find), you will not expact such a beautiful and huge hotel like this one. Especially the terrace is worth to mention, cause you will have a 360° panorama view over the whole old medina. Moreover the staff is really nice: I met JAMAL, who showed me the complete hotel. He is a really nice person, very warm and friendly. He is caring all the time.

 October 2018,5,So glad we stayed here!,"Let me start by saying that Fes is a culture shock- and a difficult city to navigate, even for seasoned travelers. My husband and I stayed for our one-year wedding anniversary and are so glad we did. It was a comforting calm in the chaos of Fes. We arranged for an airport pickup and honestly don’t know how we would have found the riad without doing so- you MUST do this. The man that picked us up waited for a while for us to get through customs and it was pouring rain- so grateful. He drove us to the edge of the Medina where another guy met us to help us with our bags and navigate 15-20 min walk through the Medina to the riad. The riad is quiet and beautiful- I think we got one of the smaller rooms and it was gorgeous and comfortable with a rooftop overlooking the old city.

Buffet breakfast is also good, with fresh juices, pastries, and an omelette station. They even agreed to serve us breakfast at 6:30am the day we had to leave (normally breakfast is 8-11am). Cons: The riad is in the heart of the medina, which makes it a bit difficult to find, but just follow the signs to the Riad Zitounia, ignore all the hasslers, and you'll be right there.

Also, spa is only small open pool (in winter not possible to use), very expensive masage and very expensive hammam (30 Euros per person). We did not use it. It is extremely difficult to find anything in medina, so we asked staf to help us find guide, and we paid that twice more than our friends 2 weeks ago (70 Euros for me and husband. Plus tickets.

Small acts like; booking a taxi for me from the airport when I rang to say my flight was going to arrive later than anticipated, arranging a day trip to chefchouen when all the bus tickets were sold out, and even printing off my boarding pass for my return, to name a few, ensured that no eventuality was too strenuous taking away the stress and beauracracy of travel, and really made this a holiday, in all senses of the word.

Do not fret when you pull up to the gate of the medina and still need to walk 15 minutes through little alleys down to the Riad - this is how all of them are! Someone form the Riad will come meet you at the city gates and bring your bags with you. We would absolutely recommend the traditional hammam spa service and massage from Fatima. The food was pretty good at the Riad restaurant - the kitchen was open pretty much all the time and breakfast was included. The wifi was spotty but if you sit down by the pool then it works better.

Most importantly, the staff is ALWAYS there to help, whether it’s walking you to dinner, bringing tea to your room, or offering advice about the area. They go above and beyond. We can’t say enough positive things about this place. Don’t miss it!",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

We were celebrating and my special requests were attended to in the most caring and special fashion. Our bedroom in the riad had the highest ceilings I have ever seen in a bedroom, probably upwards of 35 feet (11m). Breakfast was delicious and generous.

 October 2018,5,Look no further...this is THE place to stay in Fes!,"Although the main entrance to the hotel looks faceless, the interior of the riad is stunning. On many occasions, we stopped to admire the beautiful, large courtyard dating back to the 17th century that had the characteristic arches and panels with intricate designs. Service in the dining area was impeccable and the food well-prepared with generous portions. We had reserved a room with an extra bed for the third person but were pleasantly surprised to be assigned a suite with 2 large rooms! Many thanks to Jamal for taking the time to share with us the historical significance of the riad and making special arrangements for us to have our buffet breakfast before 7 am so that we could check-out early.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2018,5,Beautiful gem in the heart of Fes,"We stayed here in October during our tour of Morocco. Weaving through the maze of streets of the Medina you approach a relatively nondescript front door. Once you enter, you have been transported back into a different age. The riad has much of it old architectural features still in place. Old cedar woodwork, beautiful tile work and multiple open courtyards make you really feel that you have arrived in the Morocco of your dreams. The staff was so helpful and friendly. Jamal made sure that every aspect of our stay was top notch. Our room was gigantic and overlooked one of the courtyards. We felt like royalty in our suite. The food was excellent. The aromas coming out of the kitchen beckoned you to dinner every night. Would definitely stay here again and we strongly encourage…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

Our host Jamal was wonderful. I joked that he never sleeps, helping us during breakfast, lunch and dinner and we had dinner at 9 pm.

The roof top sunbathing was exceptional - we were the only ones catching the sun because of the quiet season!

 May 2018,5,Hidden rooftop treasure!,"Far Bensouda is nestled in the heart of the Medina yet us a tranquil haven. We stayed at this riad for a week during May. The weather was beautiful, with long sunny days. This meant that we spent a long time either relaxing by the plunge pool, or up on the rooftop taking in the breathtaking views. It felt like one of the highest points in the Medina, and it was wonderful to experience the 360 view. The decor of the rooms, both private and communal was beautiful and tasteful. The food was traditional and the restaurant by the pool side had a very relaxed and cosy vibe. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful in every way.

It is a 17th-century courtyard and we've honestly never seen something that beautiful. My husband is an architect and he really couldn't believe his eyes, it's much more impressive in reality. The room was OMG !!! super clean, very comfy and beautifully decorated. The bed was so comfortable that we were looking forward to sleep in it every night.

Located in the heart of the city, the proportion of this place is majestic. Beautiful courtyard, terrace,and pool area. Our room on the second floor around the inner courtyard was 7 meters high embellished with original tiles and woodwork completed with modern amenities for your comfort.

Another reviewer used the word ""enchanting,"" and that's a perfect descriptive. I felt very much in the center of things, part of the medina's natural flow once I stepped outside, and in a peaceful haven inside. I could not get enough of seeing and listening to the city from the roof terrace...and the cheerful chirps of the birds who congregated in the early evening in the vines of the small courtyard outside my room.

Hassan was incredibly accommodating. As two female travellers, we were incredibly appreciative that Hassan arranged for us to be escorted to and from our taxi when going out for dinner late at night, as well as providing us with a mobile phone to contact him.

Very good breakfasts, dinner portions large - the lamb tagine and chicken couscous were excellent. Small plunge pool in central courtyard. There are guides to take you anywhere in the medina, and back, otherwise you will get lost. A small tip is all that is necessary. If you want a professional guide for 3 hours that will cost you A$60 or more.

He was so helpful and made us feel very comfortable and safe during our time here. The two young men that helped with breakfast and dinner were also very warm and kind. The dinner at the riad was the best we had during our stay in Morocco. The cook here is very good! We have never had hammams before, but wanted to try it after doing a Sahara desert tour.

The pool is perfect for a dip after a long and sunny day walking around the city. It is also a perfect place to read a book and escape the loud streets of the Médina.

I felt safe and welcome all the time but had enough space for privacy and peace. And the dinner in the property is extraordinary! Also the breakfast is delicious and prepared with care. 今まで数多くのリヤドに滞在してきましたが、金額、質、過ごしやすさ等を含めてトータルで素晴らしかったです。ご飯はもちろん、スタッフの方はどなたでも毎日声を掛けてくださり、 一緒に住んでいるかのようでした。3日間の滞在ではありますが、気に入りすぎてその後のフェスでの滞在中もしょっちゅう遊びに行かせてもらいました。レストランで食べたケフタタジンとハリラスープは格別でした。私はﾍﾞﾝｽｰﾀﾞ本家の三階居室に泊まりました。室内温度やシャワールーム、そしてベッドやアメニティまで全てに行き届いたリヤドの配慮が感じられました。次にフェスに滞在する際は、必ず定宿にすると思います。",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

So it is a relief to get back to Dar Bensouda, hidden in the medina, that offers a great rooftop view over the city. The Dar goes back 300 years with a wonderful courtyard. Service is fine, as are the rooms. The layout is a bit odd, with the swimming pool adjacent to the entrance in the middle of the dining area.

 June 2018,5,The best way to enhance your Moroccan experience!,"Traveling to Fès, Morocco's oldest city, is a treat in itself but staying at Dar Bensouda makes the trip all the more special. It is one of the most beautiful Riads I have ever been in, the tile details, the wood frames, everything inside is simply photogenic. Staying at a traditional place like this makes the travel so much more intimate and magical! The rooms are beautifully decorated, very clean and feel so luxurious. The pool area is great for beating the Moroccan heat and unwinding after walking around the Medina, also the terrace is a must for sunsets! The food here was delicious! If you come in June/July ask for the okra tajine (sooo good!) and in the morning be sure to try the traditional cheese they make in house, goes great with the moroccan bread and mint tea!

 June 2018,5,Amazing stay at beautiful Riad!,"The Dar Bensouda can be difficult to locate within the winding streets (as with all things in the Medina). Make sure you call the property beforehand so they can send a guide to meet you at one of the entrances - I'm sure they'd be happy to do so! The Riad was a beautiful property situated in the heart of the Medina, tastefully decorated with a Moroccan flair. The rooms were spacious, luxurious, and clean. The pool and sun beds were also a lovely respite from the Moroccan heat. The food served at the Riad was good value for money in comparison with the other places to eat in Fes. We would especially recommend the stuffed squid tagine (even if you've gotten really sick of tagines)! The staff in the Riad were really the highlight of our stay in Fes.

At the tail-end of our action packed trip through Morocco, this place was an amazing place to unwind. The whole property is stunning - the architecture is intricate and unique. We enjoyed the pool and various lounge areas, including the rooftop patio. Our room was huge, will vaulted ceilings and a second floor bathroom and changing area. Immaculately clean and accented with more modern furniture, the design is very well balanced. The location is right in the midst of the hustle and bustle of old Fes, perfect for those wanting to be immersed in the action- however everything is calm and quiet once you enter Riad Dar Bensouda.

Although the riad itself is nice (rustic but clean) the neighborhood where it is located is truly disgusting. You have to walk about 10-15 minutes to get there and during the walk you have to dodge donkey poop and urine. The smell was so bad in some parts we almost gagged! There is also lots of garbage and stray cats getting into the garbage bags. It was really depressing.

You eat well, the cleanliness is impeccable, the decor very pleasant for the eyes. Breakfast is included.

 September 2017,5,Beautiful Oasis,"Nothing but great things to say about this hotel. This was the most beautiful Riad we stayed in. From the moment we arrived, it was like an oasis amid the hustle and bustle of Fez. We were greeted with tea and cookies - a lovely and welcome touch after a long walk from the train station (we could have done a pick up but thought it would be nice to walk!) The room was amazing and the service was impeccable. The dinner was delicious. The lamb tagine was the best we had our entire trip! The entire Riad is gorgeous. Make sure to check out the rooftop for amazing views over Fez. My only caution is that it can be a bit difficult to find due to its location deep in the medina. But they will offer guidance or a pickup. Well worth the adventure! If you stay in Fez, a stay at Dar…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2017,5,Perfect in every way,"If you are going to Fez, look no further. Dar Bensouda was an amazing experience. The minute we walked in to the Riad, we felt relaxed, overwhelmed with its beauty and new we had chosen the right place. We were welcomed by Said, who is an amazing manager. We were looked after impeccably for 3 days. Said helped us with everything from restaurant coming to collect us, guides in the Medina (you must get one for your first outing, as you WILL get lost), food orders, Haman booking and so much more. He is friendly and always happy to help. He is an asset to the Riad. We were 3 couples staying for 3 nights. All our rooms were so beautiful and peaceful. They were clean, comfortable and spacious.

The restored palace is breathtakingly beautiful. We had dinner at the main courtyard. Seriously, we thought were the royalties in the Game of Thrones. Within the palace, the architecture speaks of history, and the room was very comfortable. If you have time, climb up to the rooftop tarace early in the morning for the panoramic view and meditation. Outside of the Riad, it's pretty crazy, the winding maze, kids trying to point you the wrong directions, street vendors...Once you stay there a few days, you would feel like a pro and not get bothered.

They were decorated simply but everything was perfect. We were lucky to have a room in the section where there were only two rooms facing each other. We really enjoyed the privacy especially since we could open our sitting room doors to the courtyard sitting area. If you need two rooms, I recommend asking for this section. You will end up having that area all to yourself. In terms of service, we can not say enough about Said, the manager. In Fes, hotel service is key because you will need help and you will want someone willing to go the extra mile.

 July 2017,5,"Exotic, beautiful, with 5-star comforts","We had high expectations for this hotel, yet they were exceeded. It started with pick up at the airport ... which you definitely want to arrange. It was seamless and comfortable. The driver took us a close as possible to the hotel, at the edge of the medina, where a bellman packed our luggage (for five of us!) onto a cart and led us on a 10 minute walk through the medina to the hotel. I have a very good sense of direction, but there are no street signs in the medina, and it is a huge maze. The hotel is behind a simple door, where you enter into a small complex with a series of courtyards, one with an inviting plunge pool. The common areas are lovely and inviting, and pleasingly exotic.

And the rooftop view! The rooftop is huge, with couches and chairs in every corner for some privacy. The view was incredible. The only extra recommendation I would have for someone staying at this riad would be to coordinate with the riad to send someone to meet you and walk you to the riad your first time. The riad is in the old city of Fes, which is very hard to navigate, even with a map.

We were welcomed by Sa'eed who I am definitely shouting out as a rock star of this Riad! Always happy, helpful and very knowledgeable, he arranged dinners for us, spa time in the Riad's Hammam (totally recommended), and answered all of our questions.

Simply amazing. The roof top decks provide a superb view and the property is a portal back in time. The rooms are well accommodated and have AC. Breakfast is included and I loved starting the day with eggs and pastries.

Our room was wonderful - plush bedding - we enjoyed sleeping in the down duvet in our chilled a/c room : ) Service was 5 star. The small pool, with the surrounding courtyard area is a great place to hang & chill. Breakfast was great - a large selection of different Moroccan breads, jams, olives, fruit & made to order omelettes (which were actually a bit too oily). The location is a little difficult to find, but honestly the Fes medina is a huge maze & so any riad would be challenging to find & not all of them would be nearly as rewarding to stay in!

The inside of the hotel is very large and two downstairs courtyards, this is where breakfast is served every morning and where you may eat your dinner at night. The kitchen and menu provided were far above most of the food found in the Medina.

Airconditioning available and working. Getting lost in the medina is easy and therefore we really appreciated the gesture of the Riad's staff when they offered us a mobile phone with pre-installed number of the Riad to call whenever we were lost.

Once in the Riad we were greeted with cookies and mint tea they allowed a moment to take everything in and relax before given a tour and the history of the residence. What really set Said and the Riad apart was the service on our second day our arranged tour guide bailed and didn't show up.

From the attentive breakfast staff to the manager and owner, Sayed, who went out of his way to help us--including having someone fetch us train tickets from the ONCF office, he made the stay relaxing and a real escape. Only advice I would give to anyone who stays here is to take them up on the offer to have a porter bring you to the Riad.

The restaurant on site was great providing a very good complimentary breakfast and we elected to have supper here for two nights (which was a great choice).

It's in an area with old alleyways and narrow streets that aren't particularly occupied and they're dark / not well lit. There isn't much open in the old medina late at night as well, and there weren't any options for food open after 9pm. The hotel was very sweet and whipped up some food for us.

The rooms are quiet, large and comfortable with high ceilings. It could use more lighting and definitely a luggage rack (oh my back). There are a lot of tight stairs to climb if you are not on the 1st floor (oh my knees). Our room was on the second. Complementary mint tea and coffee is served anytime.

The riad itself is much bigger than many other roads that I have stayed at before. The rooms are very spacious and clean. It strikes a good balance between culture and modernity with full wifi available throughout the riad. The breakfast was great with traditional Moroccan breakfast and fresh fruit served throughout.

 January 2017,5,One of the best room in Morocco,"I booked a double room but I was worried about getting a tiny and a dark room until I walked through the door.

 January 2017,5,Best view in town,Although Just visited for the view from the room terrace I must admit this place has the most advantageous location for photography of the city.

A breathtaking inner courtyard, tastefully renovated, also our room on two levels. Lovely staff (who seemed to be ""on duty"" a worrying 24 hours/day though), nice breakfast.

 December 2016,5,Incredible space and feeling of luxury in this wonderfully restored Riad,"This large riad has been wonderfully restored to perfection. I was mesmerized by the large detailed wooden doors. (The property was previously a Koranic school) Rooms are spacious, luxurious and ceilings must be say 15 meters high at least. The central living area is vast with many doors and rooms leading from the space. Good quality beds and lots of living room to sit around and read should you please. The restaurant serves very good meals and the breakfast is well above average. Service here is very good too. Try the Hamam service as it is excellent and you will feel wonderfully refreshed. If you want a guide I suggest you do not get one through the hotel as the guide we had was probably the worst we have experienced in Morocco.

 December 2016,5,Amazing Riad and service,"We arrived in the evening and were met by two people to take us and our luggage (whew!) through the winding medina to the Riad. Thankfully, they always had guides to take and bring us back because we never found our way on our own. When we arrived, we were amazed when we walked into our area. We had two suites that shared their own little courtyard. We were in awe by the size, lanterns, doors, etc. You really felt like you were staying in a palace! Saeed was always smiling and providing us with whatever we needed. By the time we reached Fes, our children were tired of eating tagine so he was kind enough to make pasta for them which was a huge hit. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend staying here!",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 November 2016,5,A gem in the middle of the medina in Fes,"We spent two nights here in November, 2016. It was my favorite place of any of the places we stayed in Morocco. It's in the medina and the courtyard has traditional carved wooden doors and colorful tile work. Our room was enormous as was the bathroom and was elegant and simple. The room overlooked the courtyard and we could hear the rain hitting the tile floor below. The personnel are friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant and the food was delicious.

 October 2016,5,When in Fès: stay here,"God, did I love this Riad! Simply perfect. We had the cheapest room category and the room was amazing in the small annex courtyard that opened a year ago (which I thought was even more beautiful than the main court). The room had a smart layout and furnishing (e.g. 2 power sockets on each side of the bed, beautiful romantic light). Beautiful decor, traditional Moroccan theme but modern and clean, the tiled floors were original. Location right in the Medina is perfect, and relatively easy to find as there are signs almost everywhere nearby (we also took the nearby restaurant ""ruined garden"" as orientation point). But in case we would get lost in the maze of alleys we got a little Nokia phone with local sim card, so we could call the hotel to pick us up.

 October 2016,2,Disapointed: they will never see us back in the riad,What we liked: - The staff in the hotel spoke French and English - In the hotel is was more clean than in the medina What we didnt like: - Very noisy room - Breakfast was far below expectations - the swimming pool was full of bees. Very rsiky to enter the pool - The management isn't reliable. - it is almost impossible to find the riad in the medina,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2016,5,This Riad will take your breath away! Perfect stay in Fes,"We could not believe what we saw when we arrived into this Riad. This is a restored old palace and the rooms and hotel facilities could not be more beautiful. The place smells delicious and the rooms and towels and beds all have scents and aromas. The people that work here make all their effort to please you, they bake their own break and breakfast is served by the pool in lounge tables. The rooftop area has great views and lounges to relax. No matter which employee you talked to, they would always be smiling and eager to talk to you and give you advice. We had the traditional Hamman massage here which the hotel offers - Do not miss this experience. Basically cannot say enough about this place!

Excellent attention to details and to the Moroccan architecture and history. We were a group of friends so I had a chance to visit 4 rooms and every room was beautiful, different and unique. I will come back soon to stay for few days and enjoy the place since I didn't have time to hang out or relax at the Riad. I don't want to forget the front desk guy who was friendly, professional and available. We wanted to go enjoy dinner at a local Thai restaurant. He sent one of his staff to take us to the restaurant as well as to bring us back to the Riad. The local young man who helped us with the luggage and works for the Riad was so friend and hardworking.

 September 2016,4,Amazing stay,"It was a v beautiful hotel and stay, only reason I am not giving it five stars is due to the fact that we needed someone from the hotel to take us to medina as it was very confusing to get back to the hotel, overall loved the friendly staff and ambience but for next time (yes, Morocco deserves another visit) probably will find some other hotel which is near medina but not very complicated to get to and fro from the hotel",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2016,5,"Very good and beautiful riad. Location - inside the Medina, not safe at night","The riad is very clean, beautiful and recommended. We booked two nights and enjoyed our time there. The riad is authentic and the stuff were very kind. The only thing you need to take in account is the location - the riad is deep inside the medina, so you can't arrive to the riad door by car, so there is an accessibility problem for some people. Additionally, our guide (Moroccan) didn't feel it's enough safe to go out from the riad at night, so we didn't go out after 19:00. It wasn't a problem for us 'cause we were tired from our day trip and we ate dinner at the riad - excellent meal.

The view from the rooftop is unparalleled--you can see the entire medina and surrounding countryside. Go up at sunset for the call to prayer. The rooms are gorgeous and very clean. Excellent shower, nice pillows, and elegant decor. The breakfast is great, and the restaurant is good for dinner as well. I never used the plunge pool but it looked nice. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. One word of caution: the medina is very difficult to navigate, and Dar Bensouda is fairly far within it.

The area around the pool is set up for dining and we enjoyed our daily included breakfast as well as a lovely dinner. The staff really went out of their way to make us feel welcomed/special, especially Amy and all of the kitchen staff. This place is a gem, a real oasis in the chaos of the Fez Medina!!!!

The house itself is beautiful, it's peaceful and quiet, and it is located right in the heart of the medina which is really cool. Our room was beautiful and it was a welcomed retreat after the hustle and bustle of the city. Most importantly though, the staff is incredibly kind and helpful. For one, they loaned us a local phone during the day in case we ever got lost or ran into trouble. This peace of mind was great to have when you're walking through the maze of the city. In addition, I also got a bit of a travelers stomach bug towards the end of the trip and they took great care of me. They were always around to help which is essential in a place like this.

For example, a member of our party has trouble navigating stairs and Said was happy to switch us to a room with a bathroom on the same floor. We were worried about getting lost in the Medina and Said was happy to provide us with a map and cell phone to call the hotel in the event we got lost. We cannot recommend this hotel enough.

They were able to accommodate our early/late meal times as we had tours planned throughout our stay, and the food was great. Breakfast is included daily while lunch and dinner is additional.

There is a nice courtyard pool but it does tend to be cold. Some solar heating would be good. We did a cooking course here which was great but do not expect some slick operation. This is home style cooking by a woman who speaks French/Arabic only with help from the multilingual receptionist.

The roof terrace is unbelievable (we loved having coffee out there in the morning.) However, I chose this riad over others based on it winning an award for customer service. As soon as we arrived, we were very confused by this, as the woman who was in charge was not very friendly or helpful at all. This was the case for our entire stay. This review would have been a 5, had there been any really good customer service, and if it was a rating for just the service, it would have been a 3 or maybe a 2.

The interiors of this sprawling residence are calm and muted so you can really take in how extraordinary the architecture is. The refurbishment is a real achievement. The pool area is a delight. I think it is in the best part of the medina aesthetically and atmospherically speaking; it's quiet and local but everything is within 500 meters. My advice is to explore the riad even if some parts appear off-limits as there is no signage to indicate shared spaces. A tour or explanation of shared areas at check in would have been appreciated.

There is a quiet, calming atmosphere everywhere and many bedrooms are really spacious with high ceilings and wonderful old wooden doors with a little door opening to step inside - a magical place! The welcome and helpfulness of manager and staff was unrivalled - really helpful, polite and informative. The guesthouse is very clean throughout. The breakfasts were great with fresh fruit juice, watermelon, breads and egg. We ate dinner in a few times and the tagines and couscous were first class.

The staff was super amazing and very helpful, rooms where spacious and the beds were super comfy. This Riad has a great rooftop patio, Plunge pool, and breakfast.

 June 2016,5,Faultless riad with attentive staff and amazing rooftop in the heart of the labirynth,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. For example when we asked for the recipe for the delicious welcome biscuits, the concierge interviewed the chef and translated the recipe from arabic into english for us. When we still didn't understand fully, the chef invited us into the kitchen and showed us how to make the biscuits together. They don't sell alcohol, but were very accommodating and helped us find a store to buy it and let us keep it in their fridge and drink it in the riad on the incredible roof which has 360 degree views of the city. The building itself is an incredible old piece of architecture with amazing mosiacs, doors and arches all done up in great taste.

 June 2016,5,Exquisite guest house in the Medina,"This Riad is definitely a great choice and one of the most beautiful small hotels in the middle of the old Medina in Fez. A ""Riad"" in Marocco is usually known as a small historic guest house or mansion which was at one time used as a primary residence of a wealthy family. The Dar Bensouda is some 300 years old and consists of two former mansions and was beautifully restored over a four year period. It now features a small number of authentic guest rooms on three levels and two inner courts one of which also has a little swimming pool. Using the pool at the hotel after extensive walking tours throughout the Medina and other parts of Fez really made us feel great.

The Riad is very well kept, is very clean, tidy with great architectural features. The staff is wonderful and really do make an effort to make you fell right at home which is not something you can expect staying in a hotel. The rooms are a good size with a comfortable queen size bed, shower and or bath tub. The rooms don't come equipped with some of your standard amenities such as TV, Fridge, Ironing Board or Hair Dryer so be prepared when you arrive.

Stayed there two nights and would recommend it to anyone else staying in Fes. The rooms are luxurious and very clean. The service is very professional and the hotel itself is renovated to a very high standard. The breakfast was very fresh with the usual selection of bread, pancakes, fresh fruit, tea/coffee etc served in the courtyard by the pool. A unique selling point of the hotel is its fabulous rooftop terrace. It has spectacular views of the medina and the surrounding hills of the city. I would highly recommend this hotel however during our stay we organised a tour of the medina through the hotel and felt somewhat disappointed with the experience.

The welcome drinks and biscuits were delicious! We stayed a total of 2 nights in Fes and ended up eating dinner at the hotel on our first night- which was fantastic. Highly recommend the Chicken with lemon and olive Tajine. The Harissa soup was also delicious. The waiters were hospitable. Beware that as the Riad (like most others) is in the heart of the Medina, you will get hassled ++ if you walk out at night, so word of advice is to know exactly where you're going or phone the restuarant to see if they provide you with a guide.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,The magical gem in the Medina!,"This was our first trip to Morocco and Fez, and I have to say there is something mystical and magical about the city, the Medina, and the Riad Dar Bensouda. We arrived at 11:30 pm, when the Medina is alseep. A porter from the hotel collected us at the gate and ushered us through the maze that is an eternal city. There is no preparation for when the door of the Riad was opened! it is absolutely stunning! Eunice greeted us gave us a small tour and then showed us to our suite which was impeccable!.. But this was only the beginning!

On arrival, we were served with freshly chilled water before we jumped in the pool. As it was around lunchtime, we had a Moroccan salad (plates of cooked vegetables similar to a Turkish mezze) that included roasted aubergine in olive oil, carrots spiced with cumin and other vegetable dishes. A symphony of flavours, and absolutely amazing is all I can say! (even for a food writer) The riad itself is a converted Palace restored to perfection. The rooms are contemporary and very clean.

We stayed in two different rooms, one in the main building and the other was in the newer section. Both were fantastic with the highest ceilings I've ever seen in a hotel room. But what really made our stay perfect was the staff. We were booking our vacation on the fly and had only booked one night at the hotel because we weren't sure when we were going to leave for our next stop.

 October 2015,5,Fantastic place,"This is a wonderful place in the middle of the Fes medina. We had a guy bringing us from one of the gates of the medina to the Riad. Otherwise it is impossible to find. Behind a big door an amazing place pops up. Great terraces and views over the city. Beautiful rooms. Very helpful staff. Restaurant reservations, guides, tours, etc. All really good. When we left we had an empty battery in the car. One call to the hotel and they had some one fix it for us. Super experience.

 December 2015,5,Great weekend at Dar Bensouda!,"Dar Bensouda is everything you need for a short getaway! The riad itself consists of 5 renovated traditional houses with a pool and a restaurant. Although there are about 18 rooms, the riad feels like a small B&B because of the building style and mainly because of the staff. The staff are very personal and helpful. The location is also great: in the middle of the medina, everything you need is at walking distance. The medina can be a maze but there is always someone from Dar Bensouda offering to show you the way. Tip: the building can be a little noisy just like every traditional house in Morocco, so be sure to bring some earplugs and you'll be fine :) In short, I would definitely recommend Dar Bensouda!!",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

This is place is unbelievable, the architecture and design of it all is breathtaking. It os just like a little treasure, in the middle of an old city. When I stayed at this place, it's like I took an extraordinary trip to the past that I will always remember.

The riad was beautiful and the staff was super helpful. Breakfast was amazing and delicious- very glad we got to experience this. The only issue people might have with this riad, was that we had to go uphill for a long time until we go to the place. There was someone waiting for us at the bottom of the hill to guide us and carried our backpacks. This was not a problem for us. Would recommended this place to everyone.

 October 2015,5,Most highly recommended,"Relied heavily upon Tripadvisor reviews in selecting to stay at this property. It is very well located along a quiet passage in the midst of the medina. Riad recommended that we be dropped off at the Bathe area at southwest part of medina because the cartman could transport our luggage downhill most of the way. When leaving we went to Bab Rcif, again because it was downhill. Although the network of passages in the medina is seemingly almost random there are a number of Dar Bensouda signs in dark brown to help find the way. There are even more signs for the Ruined Garden restaurant which is located minutes away from the riad. When I originally looked at pics for the property I saw a very close minaret but did not find any comments in reviews about loud calls to prayer.

 October 2015,4,Wonderful stay in this beautiful riad,"Riad Dar Bensouda is beautiful! The room was very lovely and the alcove bathroom was a treat. The courtyards, pool and rooftop were beautiful, restful and wonderfully maintained. You do need a guide to find your way and, once you are oriented to the Medina, it is located close to some of the best places in the Medina. Breakfasts were very good and served in the courtyard by the pool. The only suggestion we have is for the staff to be a bit more helpful. We found that we had to ask several times and to different people for a map and dinner suggestions. Once we talked with a manager, we got more of the information we were looking for.

 September 2015,5,Beautiful Riad,"All the photos do not do this beautiful riad justice, the restoration is amazing and the building is very well laid out as you do not feel that there are many rooms, as they are situated in separate areas. There are many beautiful seating areas and the roof terrace has a fantastic view and lots of lovely seating. We were really sad to leave, as this was the most peaceful place we have stayed in, there is almost a feeling of calm that washes over you when you walk in. Sayed was really friendly and helpful - as were the other staff - we really liked Yassem in particular!

Overall our stay was very good, the staff were very helpful when needed - arranging guides in the day, escorts at night to safely get you to and from dinner, help with buying train tickets and providing directions to various attractions; and the building was absolutely beautiful - especially the view from the rooftop. However, the longer we stayed, the more we started to notice some things that were not so nice. Our room was very, very noisy.

Beautiful courtyard with wonderful Islamic architecture, fantastic pool area to have breakfast, huge room with wonderful bed, a luxury bathroom on a separate floor(!) and a fantastic rooftop terrace. The staff were friendly and accommodated our requests for transfers and laundry. Everyone spoke fluent English and was up for a bit of banter. We would recommend a transfer to the riad just as fez medina is so bewildering the first couple of days. If you can't read a map, then maybe this riad won't be for you when exploring the medina without a guide! The only downside is the pricey extras.

The door to our room was extremely old and must have been at least 20 feet tall. The staff was helpful, and the breakfast served with the room price was excellent. The only problem we had was locating the hotel. Armed with the best Fes map available and a very good sense of direction, it was still very very difficult to find, as it is about 15 minutes walk south of the main thoroughfares in Fes. I realize one is supposed to get lost in Fes, but finding the hotel, even after getting my bearings in Fes proved difficult. The hotel is worth looking for.

As soon as you enter the doors you feel like you've stepped back in time. The large swimming pool is a huge treat in the middle of Summer. The rooftop deck was beautiful as well, even though we rarely used it due to the heat. The meals were absolutely delicious!

Breakfast and Dinner - Delicious, and different choices each day. They always offer mint tea with these delicious cookies. Everything is made onsite including dinner.

Very polite, friendly and professional, Said will make any tourist request come true as his knowledge of Fez is spot on!!! One last mention is for Soued, the brilliant masseuse.

It's an old medresa and has kept all it's original features, the carvings, the tiles, the doors. The rooms were gorgeous especially if you get the suit you even have your own private courtyard! Parting Impression On top of getting one of the best riad in Fes, it is also the best restaurant in Fes. We simply just eat the lunch and dinner and that avoided being pestered in the souk and not knowing where to eat.

 March 2015,5,Hotel helped us navigate ther maze of the medina.,Beautiful property with extremely helpful service. Visiting Fez can be challenging because the Medina is really confusing. We were very happy we booked this riad because they went above and beyond by doing things like walking us to our restaurant and out of the medina after our stay to a car rental that they arranged. The service made a huge difference in making our time in fez manageable and comfortable. They were like a buoy in the chaos if the medina and our stay would not have been the same without their great service. Along with the great service you will also get to to stay at a very beautiful and authentic riad. We were very impressed by the originality of the hotel which added interest to our trip.

After a fairly late flight into Fez (8pm arrival) the hotel's taxi driver Muhammed was waiting for us. He was very friendly and gave us a few tips on our 20 minute drive to the Riad. Hamid was waiting at the entrance to the riad, which is pedestrianised. He carried our bags and led us through the maze of alleys to the hotel. We were very thankful for this as the medina is a bit daunting at night to inexperienced tourists.

We had the suite and it was really nice, comfortable and everything perfectly clean. The people working there and the manager Said, they have been really kind, professional, always present and really helpful - they have good contacts with local touristic guides and touristic drivers, through them we have been able to visit the whole region in a comfortable and funny way.

The staff were very helpful and arranged for someone to meet our taxi and guide us to the riad (we would definitely recommend this as it'd be very difficult to find on your own for the first time!). There are lots of helpful 'Dar Bensouda' signs around the medina so we got our bearings quite quickly. Our room was enormous and lovely and cool. The view from our bed over the courtyard was wonderful. It was great to have a pool to cool off in the middle of the day. I also arranged to have a massage in the riad which was a treat!

As we were following the signs that the riad put up and navigating through the narrow street of Fes medina and trying to locate Riad Bensouda, we were getting increasingly overwhelmed by the maze-like street and non-stop pestering and almost regret for booking a place inside the medina. When we finally arrived at the Riad, my husband and I were almost in tears. This is when Ziad came out to greet us and told us that ""yes, you are safe now!""

The large, sparsely furnished rooms with fountains and tiles give one a feeling of coolness and calm after the heat and frenzy of the city.

Although not exactly easy to find, if you have a good sense of direction, you should be able to navigate to and from on your own pretty soon. There is a little bodega nearby that sells water an snacks after hours and the walkways are quiet and safe. The service was excellent. We were served a snack and tea upon arrival, even though it was Ramadan. Since I was traveling and not fasting, I was prepared to chug some water and snacks in my room, so I appreciated the gesture.

Overall great staff, spacious clean rooms, and breath taking views all around, however, just need to be fit, as there is plenty of walking involved, from where the taxi drops you off.

It's a beautiful hotel, very authentic with large, traditional rooms and a fantastic view from the roof. I would definitely recommend this hotel for couples and not for families with young children just because it is so tranquil, I think you'd probably feel a bit out of place. As for the location, it's perfect... IF you want the real Moroccan experience and don't mind a 10-15 minute walk through a labyrinth of streets and pushy sellers. If you're a confident traveller (and not a single woman) it's fantastic but I don't think it would be to everyone's liking.

Inside the riad is amazingly renovated, roof terrace and pool area are great to relax.

We stepped through the great wooden door into an atmosphere of spaciousness and timelessness, with a wonderful subtle scent of orange blossom in the air and a dignified welcome from the very professional manager. Our rooms were on either side of a splendid courtyard open to the sky and, while they had every modern comfort, had been renovated in such a way that the sense of history was very present.

 August 2013,4,Excellent but beware location & Taxes !,"The Riad deserves its very high rating and the staff really were fantastic. We only had breakfast so can't comment on the dining. BUT BEWARE: Travellers need to be aware of two major negatives. If you book online (at least through lastminute.com) it doesn't include local taxes and services, so you will get a bill for this at the end of your stay. AND The Riad is located in the heart of the Madina where no cars go....... so you will walk approx 1km from your taxi drop through winding streets/alleys................. you need a guide (which in most cases the hotel will provide ) and it is hilly and hot, so not for the infirm. Oh, and if it doesn't say so on the blurb...... both our rooms had aircon; a must in August!",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2013,5,Best riad in morocco,"This was by far the best riad we stayed in on our 2 and a half week moroccan adventure. Such a peaceful place to escape to after a day in the Fez medina! The pool area was so lovely and the rooftop terrace had one of the best views of the Fez medina. The staff were so friendly, our room was absolutely amazing, comfortable bed and modern bathroom fixtures (the only accommodation we had in morocco with good water pressure). Although a little out of the main area it was still easy enough to find and the riad staff organised someone to meet us to and from taxis and also said if we ever got lost to call and they would find us. The breakfast was a delicious assortment of crumpets and breads with jams and fruit.

Our room looked out into the intricate courtyard, had a beautiful bathroom (I want to model my bathroom after this one!), had air conditioning (very important in Fes in July!), was clean and relaxing.

 June 2013,5,Heaven On Earth,This Is a beautiful oasis in the a big and beautiful medina from the 12th century. Used to be a house where the Imam lived. Restored beauitfully but kept simple. We had a big suite with a salon and a huge bathroom one floor up. It was pure luxury. More importantly the service was simply impecable. Nothing was too much trouble for Said Mouthadi and his team. A lesson in hospitality can be learned from these guys. Brekkie was served by the pool side. Simply fantastic. One night we got lost and we stopped in a shop and called the riad. Within 5 mins there was someone to pick us up and take us home. On departure we had to catch the early train to Tangiers. The porter from the Riad took us down to the taxi stand.

The rooftop terrace is very inviting, with plenty of space to lounge around and a shower to cool down in the summer heat - best place to admire the views over the medina, truly unforgettable. Our room was ideally tucked away in a quiet corner, impeccably clean, cozy tadelakt bathroom with large bathtub, aircon worked perfectly. Said and Mohamed really made us feel we we're in good hands.

Prior to entrance we had to call the Riad and have a member of staff come and meet us by the Hotel Bartha. The location of this Riad is not good and not entirely safe given the tiny side streets you have to walk through and past groups of Teenagers, be aware of this. The Riad and staff were very good, everything you want in a original Riad & we were upgraded to beautiful room which was one of the very best rooms we have stayed in.

One was big with a low ceiling, the other was a two storey one. The little patio's inside this old palace are also so nice. So is the small swimming pool, the rooftop terrace and the fresh breakfast they serve in the morning. The staff is really helpfull. We were there with 4 girls, and every night they told us to call from the restaurant when we want to come back so someone from the hotel would walk us back. Cause the little streets of the Medina get really dark at night, and what's more annoying is the fact that all men or little boys want to walk with you to the hotel.

Siad suggested great dinner locations made the bookings and arranged guides to escort there and back --what more could one ask for! For the cynics among you no there was cross ownership or indeed family ties to the restaurants, just good food well presented in nice surroundings. Riad has a relaxing roof terrace/sun area.

On arriving in Fes, we found that we had not made our travel arrangements as soundly as we had thought... we didn't realize that Bensouda was so accommodating, and that they could send someone to pick us up at the airport and escort us to the hotel! So.. we had a very stressful time of navigating our way from the airport to the city and then through the Medina.

I’m a bit nervous writing this review, as I don’t want to be booked in perpetuity thereby preventing me from staying again. However, they do deserve the praise. Premier personalized service, head and shoulders above other places (though the standard in Morocco is quite high). We received a lot of information on where to go, how to get there, and so forth. As this property is right in the heart of the Fes medina, you definitely need all the help you can get to avoid getting lost. Now, let’s get to the building itself.

The Riad is an ancient building with wonderful modern bathrooms - just try to not get the room that we had which was right by the main entrance. Everyone walks back and forth.

This gorgeous restoration of the former Iman Bensouda has a beautiful courtyard complete with pool (too cold to use in December) and cozy, warm dining room. The food we had at our dinner here was our first taste of a more refined Moroccan cuisine, which after several guide and driver-directed meals (they go for places that are safe and give them a free meal, but are totally forgettable cuisine) we loved. The rooms are lovely, but it’s the staff that makes this place amazing. My daughter’s and my suitcases were lost (grrr Iberia), and although we’d done some shopping, we were out of clothes by day four with no luggage.

The room was beautiful in it's simplicity and tradition - no TV or radio etc.(although it did have very welcome air conditioning). The room was huge and the bathroom fantastic.

This is an oasis of calm in Fez, but not far from anywhere.Said and his team were helpful and informative, the rooms were delightful, the terrace and plunge pool very welcome, the hamman good and the food excellent. You will need help first (or 2nd and 3rd) times to find this, but this can be arranged easily.

The manager, Said, was wonderful; he was accommodating, connected us with a wonderful guide, told us what to do if we got lost (which we did), and was just an all-around wonderful person. The staff was friendly, the food was outstanding, and the physical space was lovely, immaculate, and a good size for two.

Breakfast was delicious, as were evening meals in the restaurant. Said and his staff were very welcoming and helpful, from moment they greeted us at the train station, to wishing us farewell at the airport.

 March 2012,5,Best thing in Fes,"Bar Bensouda is the best value holiday expenditure I have ever made. The hotel is beautiful. Honestly, it is prettier than many of the tourist attractions you’ll encounter and, for the surroundings, its very very cheap. The manager, Seyed, will do anything you ask of him and his team will bend over backwards for you. I really can’t recommend this hotel enough. It is located right in the heart if the Medina, so you get a “real” experience, but navigating the streets at night can be very daunting. Definitely arrange for someone to come meet you at the gates. Fes can be a bit tiring at times, everyone is out to get as much money as possible out of you. Dar Bensouda served as an oasis in the mist of it all.

First of all, someone met us at the car to walk us (and haul our luggage) through the amazing, but difficult to navigate, medina to ensure we found the Dar Bensouda. We walked in and were amazed - the pictures don't do it justice. It looked like a magazine. Greeted with Moroccan tea and cakes, and then taken to our room through the beautiful courtyards.

Breakfast is pretty much standard for morocco which is mainly the local bread served with jam. Having a nice bowl of constant supply of Moroccan oranges is a welcome touch.

Our rooms were double volume and the bathrooms exquisite. The service was which was the most mind blowing- no request too onerous.

Breakfast was nice, and the staff made it for us very early on our last day. Said and the rest of the staff are forever accomodating and smiley. They send someone to pick you up, so the first time you do not need to worry about finding the place. Later on, they provide a map to help you come back quickly to the riad from the main streets.

The property has been beautifully restored and the courtyard a calm & quiet oasis after the hustle and bustle. Our rooms were lovely and large with double height ceilings and fabulous bathrooms. I have to say there is something in the comments about the location. It's at the souk end of the medina, on the edge of the little streets where people are busy making things.

This Dar has serious limitations! The location within the medina is not great - lost amongst poorly lit, smelly alleys - feels unsafe, certainly in the evening, not easily found after you leave the place amongst the tortuous alleys, some distance away from areas you regard as desirable for tourists (walking around, cafes, restaurants, shops). Inside, the decoration needs much to be desired. It feels abandoned, almost like a building site. The courtyard, which in theory has all the assets to be charming, needs many plants which Morocco or riads are famous for, making it real Moroccan and charming.

 June 2010,3,Traditional Riad deep in the Fez Medina,"Ticks all the boxes in terms of a Moroccan riad. Beautiful building, sensitively restored. Rooms are simple, but well furnished and finished. The bathrooms are an absolute treat. Breakfast is also delightful and dinner, if you choose to take it, is very Moroccan. The location is tricky and despite staying nearly a week, and being veterans of the Marrakesh medina, we didn't manage to find our way back to the riad unescourted the entire time - even during daylight. It isn't a problem as the hotel is happy to send someone to find you or you can avail yourself of one of the many helpful young boys who will guide you for a small sum. My one complaint is that the website claims the riad has a pool and a garden, which would lift them above the standard riad and why we chose to stay…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2010,5,A haven of peace in the Medina - Sayid & Mariah you're great!,"Amazing place to stay. Really well restored, it offers all comfort of a modern hotel with the personality of a historic building. Our room was lovely, hardly no decoration, just a few exquisite details here and there to enlarge its beautifulness. White and very clean sheets in a big and comfortable bed. The bathroom is also really clean, big and beautiful, it reminded me of the grain-ksars I saw in Tunisia. Regarding the food we only had breakfast: warm pancakes, fresh orange juice (delicious), bread, orange marmalade, butter, coffee and milk and fresh fruit (water-melon). You can choose to have it in the inner patio or upstairs in the roof terrace with the magnificent 360º view of the city. The staff is very helpful, especially Sayid, he is a great manager and very…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2010,4,Delightful Riad with Medina Magic,"Newly restored Riad in the heart of the Medina. Beautifully redone by the folks who own Marrakech Riads, this place will only get better when the pool and new restaurant is completed. Wonderful service from Said, Maria and Ibrahim; excellent booking assistance from Imane. Beautiful suite with adjoining room open to the skies. Only noise is from the birds overhead and the people of Fes going to work, along with the calls to prayer.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 March 2010,5,"Amazing building, with authentic charm","So many riads have been completely restored, losing some of the authenticity. Dar Bensouda is a wonderful mix with an old-world atrium , and updated rooms. Our room was on two-levels with the bathroom on the bottom and the bedroom above. When we were there, work was still being done on a ground-floor pool and patio. Despite those being incomplete, the existing rooftop deck was nice and it has a great view (it could use a few more lounges). One of the neighbors was evidently a dye workshop and had beautiful skeins of red yarn hung out to dry. We only ate one meal at the riad, but it was delicious. It was surprising how helpless we felt in Fes, staying in the heart of the maze-like medina. Although we were fine getting around Marrakech, this was a whole different game.

 May 2010,5,A beautiful place for a relaxing stay,"It is a gorgeous riad and the manager was lovely. We had originally booked one night in a standard room, which was lovely, but when we wanted to stay a second night it was not free. The prestige room was available but instead he upgraded us to the suite deluxe which was amazing. A beautifully decorated suite, spacious and a nice view of the town from the bedroom window. On the morning we left we had to leave early and they didn't hesitate to make us breakfast very early in the morning. A great place and no doubt you will love it.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 May 2010,5,Fantastic Fes Experience,"This riad is beautifully restored in the heart of the Fes Medina. We spent three nights there relaxing, touring, and getting ready for a four day journey across Morocco to Marrakesh and this riad was clearly a highlight of our Moroccan experience. The rooms were spectacular and authentic, the food was great and the staff were extremely welcoming and accomodating. Close to the center of everything in the Medina. The highlight for us was the roof top breakfast looking across the Medina, to the surrounding hills and walls truly on the top of Fes hearing the calls to prayer, smelling the smells of the ancient city (and tanneries from time to time). We also loved the guided tour (reccommended by trhe staff) of Fes - and it was a worthwhile and unforgettable experience.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2010,5,wonderful hotel,"We arrived a little shell shocked after a very early start, but we greeted at the nearest city wall gate by a staff member and guided through the streets of the medina to the Riad where we were greeted with mint tea and cakes, the hotel is a very subtle mix of old and new as much of the old architecture and structure remains as possible but the rooms are comfortable and modern with great bathrooms. Make sure you get up on the roof not only as you can see into the courtyard but also get a great view of Fes. The staff as everyone has mentioned were very helpful always smiling especially when my youngest cousin who is studying in Fes came to join us for tea/dinner. The food is good both the breakfasts and dinner, breakfast is bread cheese jam etc with either a folded pancake or…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2010,4,Manager set the tone,"We stayed at Dar Bensouda for 3 nights in May 2010. The manager Said clearly set the tone-- and what a tone it was. Outstanding service and friendly staff. I second the positive reviews on tripadvisor and add the following tidbits. Dinner at the riad was very tasty but seemed a tad overpriced. That said, the second night we ate there, I asked for the salads only (delicious and bountiful), my husband had salads plus tangine, and we were only charged for one meal-- suddenly dinner became a bargain. We also asked the riad to clean two pairs of pants and a shirt-- which was done at no charge. The only reason my overall rating is 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because some of the common area furnishings seemed a bit tired. But, overall this riad was beautiful and excellent…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2010,5,Startlingly beautiful. comfortable.wlcoming,"I am a real person who never writes reviews - until I went to Morocco - This riad is so beautiful that you could spend a lot of time in Fes just sitting in the courtyard and soaking it all in. An former home of a famous imam - the place is exquisite. The rooms were comfortable and spotless. Best of all is the staff - Said would do anything to help you. Ibrahim spent half the time we were there finding us and returning us to the hotel (Not possible NOT to get lost.) And sweet Maria. They are not quite finished with their plans for a restuarant and hamam, but you won't miss it. The food they served us in the riad (courtyard) was excellent. They even have a laundry service and found us a guide Hassan - a very learned man.

 May 2010,5,The best place to stay in Fez.,"During a week-long business trip to Fez, three colleagues and I stayed at the Dar Bensouda. We reserved rooms in this Riad simply because it was one of the few that we could find that had just the right combination of rooms available for our travel dates. Our stay turned out to be an unexpectedly magical experience. The rooms are comfortable, quiet, and spacious. The staff is multi-lingual, endlessly patient and helpful. Service is first class in every respect. It is nearly impossible to find the Dar Bensouda if you don't already know the medina, and you will definitely need help if you have more than one piece of luggage. Just call the Riad when you arrive in Fez to arrange for somebody to meet you at the taxi stop outside the medina. I will definitely return to Dar Bensouda.",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2010,5,A stunning riad with a palatial interior,Dar Bensouda is an absolutely beautiful place to stay. The courtyard is amazing as are the rooms. They are really spacious and very elegantly decorated. The view from the rooftop terrace is also breathtaking and we loved their breakfasts and dinners. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly and went out of their way to make sure you were well taken care of. We had to get a 7am train to Tangier and they even sent us off with a packed breakfast and lots of orange juice! It is tricky to find in the middle of the medina but again the staff offered a guide to either take you where you needed to go or meet you if necessary.

 April 2010,5,a peaceful oasis inside medina,"We've just come back from morocco and we've spent a beautiful vacation in Dar Bensouda. Location is excellent, although very difficult to find by yourself (like everything else inside medina): inside Medina, 10 min. far from Rcif square (by foot) but not too close to any mosque, to avoid the risque to be awakened in the middle of the night (they start calling for the prayer at 4.30!). Tannieries souq and Karaouine university are also 10 min. far by foot. The Dar has been recently restored, and it's simply amazing: decoration, wood doors, and a wonderful terrace with an astonishing view over the medina (we suggest to go upstairs at sunset). Our bedroom, booked through booking.com, was basically composed by 3 rooms: the bedroom, a wardrobe room and the huge bathroom. It was clean,…",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2010,5,Just perfect,"This Riad is the best hotel we have ever seen. Said and the staff are so helpful and friendly. The rooms are so clean and the bed is so comfortable. The bathroom is also very clean and beautiful. I think that this is the best hotel in town. We had a standard room and it was a perfect room. It's very good value for money. We are students and so we cannot sleep in a 4star-hotel, but Dar Bensouda is like a 4star-hotel but for a very fair price (we paid 76 € for the hole room). We also had dinner two times in the Riad and the food was delicious. Also the breakfast is very delicious. We can really recomand this hotel to everyone. And if we'll turn back to Fes one time...we will choose Dar Bensouda. It's a perfect place!!!!!",Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hotel_Spa_Riad_Dar_Bensouda,Fes_Fes_Meknes

The hotel counts with several impecable rooms, very well decorated in an unchaotic moroccon manner, a lovely patio, and an astonishing terrace from which you can see the view of Fez and have delicious breakfasts in the morning.

 March 2010,5,WOW!!! Pleasant surprise!,"During the 2 weeks of our travel in Morocco, this was by far the best place we stayed at. We had to book this hotel last minute with little time to research it. The pictures don't do it justice. It is a bit far to get to but we never had to do it alone. There was always somebody coming to meet us or walking us to the main street. The walk is definitely worth it. This is luxury where you don't expect it. The bathroom in our room was on the 2nd floor (yes, it had 2 floors :) and our room had a very relaxing feel to it with giant wooden doors and flowing sheer curtains going all the way to the ceiling (which was cathedral). The rooftop patio was huge and made us wish that we could stay longer.

Many, if not all, the rooms have gigantic antique doors... mind your head because they hurt when you walk into them (the inner door within the overall door... really, it hurts!). There is a separate dining area with a working fireplace... great during the cooler months. Outside, there will soon be another lounge area with swimming pool.
