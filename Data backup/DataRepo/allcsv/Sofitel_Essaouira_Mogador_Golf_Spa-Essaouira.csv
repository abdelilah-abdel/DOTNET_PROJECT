 May 2022,2,NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE,Not a good experience at all. I would not stay there again if they paid me to do so. I felt insulted on more than 1 occasion by Reception staff. If you do stay there my advice would be to keep receipted invoices with you at all times for what you have booked and paid for as staff don't seem to know what they have taken payment and provided receipts for.. We checked out on day 3 at 5 am in the morning to be presented with an invoice for a payment already made. No time to spend another hour sorting that problem as a 3 hour drive and a flight to catch. We were also accused of taking a breakfast one morning that we had not paid for. Very embarrassing and untrue. On principle I will never use a Sofitel again. 👎👎,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Didn't eat in the hotel, apart from breakfast which has plenty of choice, as the A La Carte restaurant was closed. Hopefully it will be open for our next visit. Hotel itself is a bit tired however given the challenges of the last two years it was no big deal for us.

 May 2022,1,Stay well away!,I think this is one of the worst hotels we’ve ever been. Everything it’s just wrong from the way the staff is behaving to the ridiculously high prices and the poor condition of the rooms. Let me just add that the hotel needs maintenance work ASAP. Aside that our room was very dirty when we arrived it had a strong smell of mold everywhere and after one night we decided to leave this horrible place. Everything is overpriced and if you are considering visiting this place here’s a friendly suggestion: Don’t!!!,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2022,2,Old and not taken care of,"This hotel did not live up to our expectations at all. The resort looks absolutely stunning on pictures but in real life it is worn out completely. Floors and ceilings are damaged, our room smelled like mold, service is bellow 5* standars. Also we chose this hotel particularly because online it says they have a bustransfer to Essaouira, but this no longer exists so either you need to have a car or take a taxi everytime you want to go to the city center which is still around 5km away so not really doable by foot. Anyway, I personally think they should close this resort and give it a complete makeover because the domain has a lot of potential but right now it's not a 5* in any way!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2022,1,Be aware before booking,"Good staff did not make up for a tired hotel. One pool was fine - other was green/dirty and not fit for use. Broken/rusty cabanas, rooms left open to the elements that would be dangerous if a child found, exposed electrical wires….list goes on (see photos). We ended up checking out early. We are in touch with the hotel and regional management of Accor Group (waiting to hear back from them), but do check before booking (and if there are services that are important to you, double check as not everything listed is available ….such as shuttle / laundry). It’s a hotel that is in dire need of investment and until that happens, it cannot market itself as a 5* hotel / charge same prices.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2022,3,It’s ok - Just don’t eat there,"The room is a good size, (albeit slightly dated) and the staff are great, attentive and ensure cleanliness is at a constantly high standard - however the same cannot be said for the dinner buffet. An array of rogue cold options that were 5/10 on a good day, there was a ‘hot section’ that was just awful, it consisted of lukewarm tagines, poorly grilled meat and very uninspiring pasta. All of this was capped off when I saw the bill of 700DHR (~£55) for 2… considering our lunch was made up of a full seafood platter for 2 near the beach for 370DHR (~£28), 700DHR for this buffet is nothing short of daylight robbery.

The staff were so helpful, showing us multiple room options, the spa and pools and then held a room for us whilst we returned to town to gather our belongings. In it’s hay day this hotel would have been amazing, it was in fact winning awards until 2017 but it’s been a while since any money has been reinvested in the property and then with COVID-19 closing it for a long time, the evidence of neglect is obvious. It’s such a shame. On the plus side the views over the pools,the golf course and dunes to the sea are fantastic,you can hear the waves break from your balcony.

My first disappointment was the big sign in front of the lobby asking guest to self park their cars. I dropped my mother off and went to park the car as the parking lot is quiet some ways from the lobby entrance. There were only 3 other cars parked there, which indicated that the hotel had very low occupancy. As I walked towards the front desk to check, the attendant was casually carrying a conversation on his cell phone, and made me wait until he was finished talking before he acknowledged my presence.

I sincerely recommend you guys to read this review till the end so you understand the scam and the drawing of my very bad experience. we’ve rented out this haunted castle and we heavily regretted it. I wish I did left one I’ve checked in but i was tired to do so. Regrettably being ripped off. Extremely disappointed with the fake AD. after several years of loyalty our stay was a disaster.

 June 2021,5,Luxury in a gorgeous place,"This place is amazing! The view, the pool, the breakfast. But the best part was the staff – they were all so nice, friendly and helpful. COVID protocols were well maintained, but not over the top. I am already planning my next trip. My only suggestion would be for Sofitel to show a bit more cultural sensitivity as a French company doing business in a former French colony and get rid of the ugly sculpture display. Why not highlight local art?",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2021,4,Wonderful View on Golf,"I Like the location, peace and offering wonderful view on golf, the staff are very friendly, i liked the room with open bathroom, good swimming pool, breakfast need some improvement but believe with COVID-19 and limited guests, it’s normal to adapt and minimize the cost.

 September 2020,5,What a find. Can’t wait to go back!,"We absolutely loved this hotel! You would be hard pressed to find better value for money for an equivalent standaed of hotel anywhere in Europe. Having stayed in Marrakech many times, we were looking for something more relaxing, and we found it. We loved the feeling of space and the quirky French interiors. The hotel has not one but two beautiful pool areas. Breakfast was varied and plentiful. Gym was great. Boyfriend played golf one day (the hotel has its own golf course).

The HK staff were also very caring,mainly ( Abdessadek,Hind & Hafid) who were very caring for us.

We haven't had the opportunity to come back for a while. Always a pleasure to find Mr Amine at the head of the catering and his excellent service! Glad to see Madame Hanane again, who this time took the head of the SPA and spoiled us. Our buttler also, Mr Chraibi took perfect care of us ! Unfortunnately, in the common areas of the hotel and the swimming pool of the villa that we had, we've noticed that materials are aging hotel is aging what unfortunately lowers the standards we've been used to.

 December 2020,5,One of my favorite stays and hands down the best in Essaouira,"I came to this place with high hopes and it really exceeded all of my expectations. It was so beautifully located and had one of the nicest interiors I have seen. I haven't had the chance to try the food but I definitely will next time. The golf was so vast and beautiful and perfect to play a game and relax. A little tip, if you love riding bicycles don't forget to rent one and you'll be delighted with a nice ride that takes you up the beach.

So far, I liked this town the most: cozy atmosphere, honest people, same I can tell about this hotel: you won't find here high end dining, but you will get an amazing butler, who will guide you through and help to explore Essaouira and Resort facilities. Room services are great, fits the 5* requirements; in general Villas (we have stayed in Villa) are slightly ""worn out"", but it is still very good choice for such price, bathrooms are modern and kitchenette always comes as the best place to gather; there is a fireplace inside the living room, the convenient sittings outside, around the pool.

The first night we got a room full of issues, no tv control, the shower didn’t work, the bath tap didn’t working properly etc. I was ready to write a very nasty review despite the fact that the facilities are beautiful and the location is not bad, especially if you play golf, but when the next morning went to the reception to ask them to change a room for we met somebody who change completely our mood. It was the lady responsible for customer relations, sorry I forgot her name, who took care about us and change our room.

Everything was arranged perfectly and we got an upgrade from Aysra and mr. Yasin from the reception, thank you !

 February 2020,1,Shocking experience,"When we checked in, the receptionist didn’t take the deposit, so whenever we ate or ordered we were asked about the payment. Staff were following us to the room to get the payment and refused to settle it while check out. This was an inconvenience mainly because myself and my husband were eating at the buffet while my mom was in the room with my baby ordering room service. I had to leave in the middle of my dinner at the restaurant to talk. They then decided to come back later but the machine didnt work and it was extremely awkward and inconvenient affair.

 January 2020,5,Very nice stay,"Truly 5 star hotel. Very good service. The room was very modern and beautiful and had a great view of the ocean from the accessible balcony. We loved the walk through the golf course to the dunes and beach along the ocean. We had two minor nits: the shower had no door and spray reached the bathroom floor. The other quibble is that this Sofitel had little about it that felt of Morocco. Could have been anywhere. But, please understand: this was a very comfortable and welcoming room.The buffet dinner was good, but not especially exceptional. We did not try the a la carte dinner.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

We were entertained by the talented Simo in the bar every evening. He is a very friendly guy and does amazing covers of songs plus his own original work. Hotel is showing signs of needing a revamp but that did not affect our enjoyment. Our room was clean, comfortable and had a lovely view over the golf course towards the sea. Food was of a good quality but somewhat expensive. We used the free shuttle into town and found some lovely coffee shops and restaurants.

The golf, access to endless beaches and the gym always offer us a great way to boost the fitness levels at the start of the year. The evening sunsets melt our hearts, coming as we do from a dark Irish winter. This past week, we have again enjoyed top notch service and lots of attention to detail.

Villa rooms were well set-out/luxurious and had everything needed plus privacy/fantastic views. Main pools pretty chilly but villa pool was heated. Other things for kids included table tennis/table football and a smaller kids area with games/art tables/a shallow pool. Golf course challenging / picturesque. We got shuttle bus into town twice and transfers from Marrakech airport (Med Taxi) so no car needed. Essaouira compact to walk around with souks/small streets and didn't feel at all hassled.

Whilst the stay I had a small issue due to no fault of mine or the hotel but as the hotel had Amazing standards I was looked after the best possible way by the Front Office Manager Mr Nabil Chagraoui he upgraded me to a nice suite in the hotel.

 December 2019,4,"Amazing hotel, despite minor issues","After the organized holiday for the group of golfers, we return with great memories. The hotel is in a unique location, with almost direct access to beautiful and well maintained golf course. The architecture and decor of the hotel is really impressive, but not all the solutions and elements are functional. Same rooms look like after refurbishing. The floors in them is made of ceramics plates. In the others, there is still the worn out coating. The breakfast is great, with many elements of local cuisine. The restaurant and pool area staff is absolutely friendly and very attentive. The free shuttle bus operates every hour bringing the guests to the city centre. Highly recommended. For sure we return in the future.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 December 2019,4,Return visit- best hotel in area.......,"This is a return visit. My last review was an average rating but this visit was so much better. The room allocated to me was much better and without the signs of W+T i had previously experienced. Staff were efficient and friendly in all areas. Whilst I do not feel this is currently a 5 star property, it is the best in the area and prices are reasonable. Location does mean that you need a car to stay here. Restaurant was very good and live music in bar with a cocktail at/ after sunset was a great way to end the day and start the evening.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

The resort is nicely laid out, the staff is super friendly and helpful, breakfast is great, rooms are not brand new but up to standard. Take a walk across the golf course and the dunes to the beach and if you are lucky you will come across some Arabian camels. Most notably we remember the nights in the bar, watching the beautiful sunset with drinks, snacks and the beautiful music of a super talented musician Simo. The way he orchestrates guitar, loop machine and voice is outstanding and beautiful. Talent scouts, go and watch Simo play.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 November 2019,4,Very Good Hotel could be Excellent with a few tweaks.,"First off, I need to say...... the restaurant in this place is EXCELLENT. The service is perfectly orchestrated (attentive but not over the top), The menu is varied but simple, The wine list varied and quite expansive, and the three lady chefs in the kitchen really should all be walking around with Michelin Stars on their whites. The Lobster was SO good, I had to ask the waiter to bring the chef so I could thank her personally, it was truly excellent food and service. So thanks guys! OK, onto the hotel...

 October 2019,4,Beautiful place and a pleasure to visit,It was over 40 degrees in Marrakesh so we decided to visit Essaouira on the coast where it was 10 degrees cooler and we were very glad we did. A quick phone call to the Sofitel and they arranged a car to pick us up straightaway for a few nights. The driver was early and the three hour drive back pleasant and informative. The hotel is just outside the town on the hill set back quite a way from the sea. The construction is white-modern Moroccan and very attractive. The reception and facilities are welcoming despite the overall impression of large scale and opulent. The rooms are large and well equipped with a bathroom which is “incorporated” into the whole (separation via a pull down curtain) which some people might find a little difficult in terms of privacy. The room was…,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2019,4,october excursion,Wow what a great hotel with large grounds for mid morning walks and two pools to lounge around to soak up the sun. We stayed here for half the week and wish we booked for longer. The staff was attentive but also gave us plenty of space to relax.

 October 2019,5,Exquisite stay in beautiful environment,"The hotel is located with a nice view of the ocean. The rooms and the hotel is somewhat used and not all works to perfection. The service is excellent and the restaurants great. We tried the buffet and gastronomic restaurant. As well as the bar in front of the swimming pool. Great experiences all the time. However the prices are the same as in Paris. Shuttle service brings you to town every full hour and back every half hour, so you can enjoy Essaouira town. We went for a golf course during 3 days, just down the hill in front of the hotel. Great teachers and beautiful golf course.

 November 2019,4,Fantastic hotel !,"We visited this hotel last June to take a look around it, helping us to decide whether to stay there on our next trip to Essaouira. We have now returned after a wonderful week at the Sofitel. It is just over 2 miles outside of Essaouira, so we hired a car in Marrakech, proving very useful for our freedom to come and go when we pleased. Taxis are readily available, organised by the front doorman though. Costing around 50 Dirhams each way. The hotel is contemporary, shiny and clean. The highlight for us was the pool, sun loungers and extremely helpful pool staff. The atmosphere was calm and quiet, providing peaceful reading and relaxation. Our room was on the ground floor with a garden terrace, plenty of space outside of the room. We loved it. The bathroom area is open plan,…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

We arrived on the morning after a three day festival and we were wondering if it would be ok after a 3 day party. I have to say the hotel and the grounds were cleared really quickly and your staff are a credit to you. I wouldn’t describe (nor do they) this as a five star property as there are a few little issue here and there but it is the people (staff) that makes a great stay. We extended our stay from 2 nights to 4 nights The rooms are great and the bathroom even better, loved watching the sun go down whilst bathing in our twin bath.

 September 2019,5,Nice weekend+,"Absolutely good place to stay. Friendly and supportive staff and a perfect breakfast (as most Sofitels have..). We had once dinner at La Kasbah, too noisy with local African 'music'. They better refrane from performing this kind of music performances. Furthermore, the food is too expensive compared to what they serve. The outside swimming pool is an excellent and relaxing place to stay. Super waiters and pool boys. Good food and drinks at a reasonable price. Bedroom with a beautiful view, overseeing the golf course and enjoying the sunset. General remark to the management: invest in proper building and facility maintenance. The site is detoriarating faster than you realize. When no actions planned immediately you will loose your Sofitel standard. Ergo: perfect stay, we will be…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2019,3,Room for improvement,"The bedroom was spacious with a good size bathroom which was a little worn. Sadly, we thought service levels require attention. One morning we had to wait so long for coffee we eventually left the breakfast area without. The A la Carte restaurant menu was very limited and sorry to say was not of the standard anticipated. We felt the staff indifferent even though the restaurant had few clients. It took some time to convince reception we only planned to pay for three breakfasts rather than four despite advising them upon arrival of this change. Fast reaction by Ismael to fix broken bedroom light. Well done Ismael.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2019,5,Great base for Essaouria,"Pros - comfortable rooms, great bathrooms, pool area is excellent as is the restaurant. Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was extensive. There is a 15 seat minibus that runs every hour from 10am to 6pm from the hotel and a pickup every hour from the town to the hotel which is very helpful. Cons - the last shuttle home is 6.30pm but a taxi from town to the hotel is only £4-5.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 August 2019,4,Villas and the wonderful Hakima,"The villas at Sofitel Essaouira are divine. I was staying in a superior room to start with and ended up moving to a luxury room then a suite as I wasn't happy. My friends stayed in a 2 bedroom villa with pool, which was absolutely incredible. The best part of our entire experience was the butler service provided for villa guests. Hakima went above and beyond in every aspect, taking our children to kids club, escorting us promptly anywhere we wanted to go, organising doctors visits when I became ill, and answering to every request. We learned there were only 2 butlers to service 28 villas due to staff changes. So given the huge allocation of villas it was incredible how prompt, friendly, responsive and helpful Hakima was the entire time.

Hopefully the management will look at it soon . Breakfast is ok but they could do better, making the cutlery and glasses easier available to guests . Also the coffee machines operated by a barrister I assume although being two in outdoor area were not working so was a bit busy the barrister from inside restaurants…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2019,5,First Time Visiting Would Definitely Recommend And Stay Again,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa which was one of the nicest rooms we’ve ever stayed in. It is definitely up there with some of the top 5* hotels Accommodation. The villa also had a private heated pool which was very large for a private pool, both bedrooms had lovely en-suites and there was also a good sized Kitchenette and a large seating area with views of the Gardens and our pool. It was so nice not to have the four of us cramped into one bedroom with a small bathroom like most hotels, even 5* hotels. The villa was very clean and the beds were some of the most comfortable any of us have ever slept in. I do however agree with other reviews that the room could have done with a bit of maintenance but this definitely didn’t impact our experience. The hotel has three restaurants of…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2019,3,Disappointing.,"Decided to stop off in Essouira on way up to Marrakech and home to Spain. Hotel is in a wonderful beachfront position but is a few miles outside of Essouira which means you need a car to stay here. Hotel is attractive externally and internally tho there are signs of wear and tear that need addressing. - W+T more acceptable in lower grade hotels , but not in a 5 star property ! It is an ongoing maintenance programme that keeps the 5 star look. Bedrooms are a good size and well furnished but again looking a little worn around the edges. Interesting design rooms where the bed is a feature and is presented/ positioned IN the room- not against a wall. Neat idea. Pool was lovely and restaurant facilities good. Currently i would not rate this as a 5 star property and , at these…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2019,1,Worst hotel experience ever,"I would like to share with my horrible experience in Sofitel Essaouira.

 June 2019,5,Sofitel Mogador Hotel,"On arrival we were greeted by friendly, professional staff, who's English was better than my French, thankfully. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom villa with private pool and butler service. I'd read some reviews after booking, so was a little worried, but despite some minor ""lick of paint"" type issues, our accommodation was clean, luxurious and perfect for our stay. We ate in the a la carte restaurant, buffet and with room service, and can honestly say that the standard of food and service was outstanding. Special mention has to go to Aziz, who help make our stay perfect. If you're looking for relaxed luxury a little out of Essouira, with amazing views, great food and service, this is the place.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2019,3,Sofitel Mogador Hotel,"I have to admit that upon entering the Sofitel Essaouira Mogador I was greeted warmly by the Hotel Manager, who asked his subordinate, to proceed with my check in procedures. His subordinate’s both English and Arabic were not understandable. I was appalled by the way she insisted on seeing my voucher of accommodation. She demanded impolitely to get the voucher in her broken language or I would not be admitted to stay. If it was not for my Agent who did the booking for me, I would be sleeping in the street. The Hotel’s cleaners' role was to organise instead of clean and report any malfunction in the room. Upon entering my room and during my stay, the two washbasins' water mixers and the Arabic water hose, known as shattaf, were not working properly.

 June 2019,3,Very average hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights in 2 bedroom villa. The condition of room wasn't great. Needs maintenance. Floors peeling. Carpet stained. Outdoor chairs mouldy. Poor in room service. Tried 5 times to ask for an extra doona but it never arrived. Not sure what is happening here with the service. Asked on checkout how our stay was and responded that we had some difficulty getting service to room. Lady didn't even take any notice of what we said just ignored us. A simple apology to let us know we had been heard is minimum expectation. Wouldn't bother staying here again.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2019,1,We fleed the hotel!,"We arrived for the Gnaouia Festival, most amazing fusion world music festival. We were so surprised by how much this beautiful facility became rotten! This hotel was designed by one of the most famous Morrocan architect, Rachid Andaloussi...he did an amazing job by all means. Unfortunately, the Accord Group dis not maintain the facilities. The room smelled so much that it was very hard for us to sleep. The floors were stained with humidity, the carpet smelled like old wet stinky fabric. The safe was not functioning and even thow a nice technician tried he could nt fix it! Next day the smell was worst. I called the spa to book a massage, a rude unprofessional gentlemen answered me and couldn't propose any arrangement at all.

 May 2019,4,Enjoyable stay but needs more attention to detail to be a 5*,"Really happy with this hotel,amazing pool area and good breakfast selection. The rooms are spacious going outside into a lovely balcony. Beware the prices for food and drink are very expensive and the hotel knows there's no shops in the area so knows guests will pay. We ate in the buffet restaurant on the first night as arrived late and it was 350 dirhams each this could get you 3 evening meals in town with drinks. To say it's a 5 star it wasn't perfect needs more attention to detail for the little things. I would expect a much higher standard for a 5*-cracked and marked floors in room and corridors,dirty windows in corridors,chipped paint and personally would say it's a 4 star.

 April 2019,2,Good for Essaouira but not Sofitel standard,"At first the hotel looks amazing due to its beautiful setting and large areal. The staff is mostly friendly, but unfortunately most of them are trained ver very bad, or probably not at all. It took 3 people to call us a cab outside of essaouira, which came 1h later than agreed. Often staff kept forgetting what was ordered. We started of with two towels per person and by day 4 had 0 in the room. The mini fridge is empty. Half of the bathroom did not work. The sheets were not changed even though they have been visibly dirty. Overall the hotel is quite run-down. Elevators do not all work. Cables are sticking out of the grass.

 December 2018,4,Nice design hotel but it needs a paint job,We staid in the hotel around Christmas time. We live in Rabat and we were positively surprised about the overall ecxellent and friendly service of the hotel staff and management. We had a beautiful spacious and clean room with a nice view on the golf course and the Atlantic Ocean. It simply couldn't be better! Fortunately we choose to have an early breakfast during our stay as it became rather busy in the breakfast location after 9:30 a.m. Food and service were great and the lady who was in charge of boiling the eggs showed to be truly skilled. The hotel is about 10 minutes away by car from cosy Essaouira. An overall paint job would contribute to the glory of this beautifully located hotel and a bit more light around the parking facility would be pleasant in our view.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2019,4,"Great location, stunning views, beautiful rooms, but...","The property is beautiful and the surroundings incredible. Rooms are nice but need upgrades, water pressure weak and maintenance in general needs improvements. Nice pools. The hotel staff is eager and willing to help and please. Food is average, ordered 3 times the Tagliatelle Alfredo at the pool bar and managed to get 3 different versions and ingredients. Golf course is nice, rented a set of clubs, bag was old and not a single zipper worked, callaway clubs but not a complete set. Would come back in spite of all minor issues, location is superb. Took a sports massage, it was more of an elbow digging than a proper massage and definitely not worth the price.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2019,4,Pretty and serene,"Lovely hotel. The rooms are very nice as are the common areas. Note about the rooms: the shower is open, their is a screen (semi opaque) that blocks the view from the rest of the room. The outdoor space/pool area is excellent. The service in the pool area is very good. There is a lack of attention to detail in the rooms and with room service. They don’t replenish the water and coffee in the rooms consistently and the people taking orders for room service struggle- we ordered in French and English, didn’t seem to make a difference. The staff is very friendly and gracious. Note: this is a taxi ride from the Médina and it will cost $50 MAD each way.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 February 2019,4,Great place off season,"Over all a great stay. The food for dinner is very good, every evening with lots of new dishes both Moroccan and international. The rooms are a bit tired, and in need of renovation. The hotel says that they care about the environment, and to leave your towel hanging if you don't want it cleaned. Yet, everyday the cleaning took all towels and bathroobs even if they had not even been used. This seems very un-environment friendly, and I would expect more from a 5* hotel chain. Traveling in February is definitely off season, and even though the hotel webpage says the outdoor pool is heated, it is in fact not and is very very cold! Staff, especially by the pool are very friendly. But at breakfast they seem very disorganised and sometimes lots of tables lack cleaning. Over all,…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 January 2019,5,A place in the sun!,"The hotel is beautifully located only a short drive away from the airport. Check in staff was friendly, and took us to our huge room with a beautiful view over the Atlantic. Our room was clean, spacious and all amenities were there. The outdoor swimming pools were too cold to swim in, but the heated pool in the spa is lovely. We went on a quad tour and they organized this for us, even with transport to and from the hotel. As it’s low season now, it’s a peace haven and ideally for people who want to relax and enjoy the sun and friendly Moroccan people. We’ll definitely come back for a couple of days to unwind.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 January 2019,4,Great place with great service,"The staff at the hotel was EXCELLENT. In Dining room as well as at reception ( Mariem, Bassma ).

The rooms are very nice laid out, and we had great views of the pool, and sunset in the Atlantic - only tiny flaw to keep it from being AN EXCELLENT property: the rooms show signs of wear and tear .... not dramatic but it shows ....

The service was very friendly, efficient and attentive. The food was good and wasn't overly expensive considering the beautiful views. Our waiter/bar tender Ouissaf Simo took time out to personally show us around the hotel - The building was exceptionally clean with some very quirky works of art which amused us.

The villa itself was quite nice with a beautiful pool, exquisite view of the golf course and sea, and modern amenities. The villa was, however, in need of some small renovations. The sliding doors to the exterior pool would not lock and the handle kept falling off one of the doors. Several of the lights didn't work and the main panel to work the lights wasn't exactly right. Overall though, the villa was clean, spacious and a nice option for a longer stay or for a family of 3-4. We didn't use the pool because it was too cold, but it seemed nice, although in need of a cleaning.

From the minute I got out of the taxi to enter the gates of the hotel, the guards crossed examined me about why I was there, and while walking into the hotel, another guard harassed me about why I was there, patiently I explained, he escorted me to a rude receptionist that told me she has no time for me as she had clients & to wait.

The free bus service to Essaouira was very useful although shame it stopped relatively early. There are some negatives.

There is a free courtesy bus to Essaouira which takes about 10/15 mins and its worth a trip to the Medina. The Spa was also clean and high standard. Drinks and Spa not especially cheap.

The hotel is super clean, the breakfast is great, the rooms are big and very confortable, the pool is amazing. Check in / check out is flawless. This hotel has an issue with service. You call room service, nobody answers, and when they do, it's after you tried for 1 hour, then add another hour for your order to arrive. The mini bar in the room is empty, what a shame when you want some snacks or a cold drink in your room late at night. Also, no coffee to use with the expressi machine.

 April 2018,3,Half board,"My husband and I are at this hotel right now . April 18. I am a little disappointed with this hotel as I do not think it’s 5*. 4* at a push. The lobby area is very encouraging at 1st glance, but that’s it really. Our 1st room was on the ground floor with a garden view. I wasn’t happy with this as I prefer to be on an upper floor (security being my thing!). Garden view was a bit of grass and a brick wall. We were moved to the 1st floor without any hassles and paid a little extra for a seaview. The room is ok as I said before, Unfortunately, the hotel is designed in such a way that the cold Atlantic sea breeze makes a nice sunny day , feel like 15 degrees lower than it is. Today the sun is out but people are laying on sun beds fully clothed and wrapped in a towel. Jeans and…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2018,5,Wonderful,"We stayed in a private villa and it was absolutely lovely. From the time we arrived the service was spot-on, with helpful and friendly staff. The villa was bright, stylish and clean and a really good size, with two large ensuite bedrooms, a small kitchen and good-sized sitting area and a fab outdoor heated pool. The pool was a lovely temperature and our kids spent most of their time in it while we read books- bliss. If you're not a fan of cold pools and can stretch to a private villa I'd really recommend it as the main two pools were pretty chilly. The temperature during our week was around 22 degrees most days and it wasn't too windy (we were there in March). The villa was a little tired in places (the door locks were a bit unreliable, our electronic curtain controls in…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Excellent quality golf course just a short walk away. Spa with great facilities and a range of treatments. Free shuttle into Essaouria and back every hour from 10:00 in the morning. So lounge wasn't open when we were there, but it looks like a well designed night club. Our room was in the Olive grove, lovely view and well equipped. There are other 5 star hotels in the area, but I would stay here again, the location and staff made it really special.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2018,5,Luxury hotel with amazing sunset views on the ocean,"This golf resort hotel is about a 12-minute drive from the seaside fishing town of Essauoira. It has two pools, one of which is fed by salt water from the ocean. The rooms were huge and very comfortable. Food was excellent. I was particularly impressed by the service. While there, for example, my built-in luggage lock quit working and I could not access its contents. Within minutes a staff person came and was able to open it without damaging the suitcase. Be aware that this is not in town. There is an hourly free shuttle van from 10 a.m. through 6 p.m., but at other times you'll need to hire a taxi to go to and from the town.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 February 2018,5,Return to paradise,We were so impressed by our visit last year that we decided to Re book direct within a few weeks of returning home. The booking was managed by the hotel from start to finish with total professionalism. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff when we arrived they welcomed us back like old friends. The holiday was brilliant from start to finish we stayed in a villa with its own private pool. We also had our own butler who provided us with all manner of things including yogart and ice cream when we asked for Yoga mats and Ice cubes!! The golf course again was in immaculate condition with lightening fast greens and spongy fairways. The spa treatments were well received by all and they hit the spot after a hard days golfing.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 February 2018,4,Return visit,"We enjoyed it so much last year we decided to return and try one of the villas with private pool. Beautiful. VERY friendly staff, amazing views.

 January 2018,1,Gave me room I had not booked,I paid a lot of money for a suite with panoramic views of the ocean and golf course. The ocean is clearly visible but the golf course is to far away to see clearly so do not book this hotel if you want a good clear view of the golf course.

Was it too much for reception? No, it wasn’t at one point l said not to worry if you don’t have a superior twin room, but they were quick to say it would be ready in no time.

Water placed in the room every night. The hotel is extremely clean. Although is a little battered and tired in places but doesn't distract from the other all quality of the hotel.

 April 2017,3,"Nice enough, but overpriced poor food spoilt it.","We stayed in a villa with its own pool, which was nice enough, but the ""kitchen"" wasn't actually functional, with no heat source and no cutlery or crockery, so a bit pointless. The food was ridiculously expensive - 3 people for breakfast? That's be £75. What? A meal in the bar was also stupidly expensive and terrible - deep fried stuff from the freezer. Awful. We drove each day into the town, parking with the help of the locals (2 euros and they take your car away all day, delivering it back like a miracle when you walk back out of the pedestrianised medina), then ate a much better breakfast for £5 a head in the characterful medina. Fun and better, but really irritating to be forced out of our expensive hotel to avoid being ripped off for poor food at high prices. Be warned!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 October 2017,5,A return to peace and tranquility,"We last visited this lovely hotel a couple of years ago and were so pleased with the whole trip that we just had to return. We'd planned the trip to coincide with my wife's birthday, in mid-October, and as we'd previously been in July we weren't sure what to expect with weather, but we needn't have worried as the temps rarely dropped below mid-20's during the day. Due to the time of year, and the fact that we were there a week before half term, the hotel was pleasantly quiet, although every evening saw the restaurant full. Unsurprising really because the food is continuously varied and excellent. Some of the tagine dishes were just out of this world, so much so that I got the head chef to give me a cooking lesson one afternoon, and have brought some great ideas back to our…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Toilet door is a frosted door with a kind of handle outside and nothing on the inside, so you have to use your finger to pull it in, annoying, 2. No tea or coffee facilities in the room! I feel this is standard for all hotels to have this facility 3. No tables in the room just these tree trunks which are damn heavy to move 4. On the very first day room service made our room by the time we had our breakfast, so when we came back it was a nice surprise. Also in the evening we had turn down service.

The room was a decent size, but NO shelves or table tops on which to put things apart from 2 little ""tree stumps"" and a very narrow shelf which ran along back of the bed. Strangely there was a huge blue tiled step-in bath in the room so I ended up putting toiletries, camera etc.etc. on it's rim and even in the bath!

The food is very good in the main restaurant, with plenty of choice. In the rooms there is a massive bath, walk in shower. We had to ask for a hairdryer but no problem getting one. Fortunately we took a kettle as they are not provided in the rooms.

 March 2017,5,Incredible views and service in a luxurious hotel,"About 40 classmates and I visited Essaouira and spent two nights here. The facilities were incredible, from the excellent meals prepared to the multiple outdoor pools. Regardless of the size of your group, the hotel offers enough places and a large enough grounds for you to find a place to hang out. The staff was also very helpful in ensuring our accommodations. The hotel is a short drive to other venues as well, my personal favorite being the ATV rental by the beach. Essaouira is a beautiful city and this Sofitel lives up to the same standard. Note: my pictures barely capture a quarter of the hotel, as the place is massive.

The premier rooms on the upper floors in the main hotel have great sunset views, but the garden rooms are well appointed too and there are plenty of places to watch the sunset. Food in the various restaurants is good, not great but very expensive in comparison to restaurants in the main town (10 minutes drive away). The attached golf course is well maintained and on calm days relatively easy to play. On windy days a real challenge.

The hotel is very beautiful, although it needs some maintenance, as it’s located close to the sea separated by dunes and golf courts. There are two experiences we would like to share as they were in absolute contrast with the rest. When we arrived at the hotel we handed over our two vouchers from the travel agent. One voucher for a room with two adults, the other voucher for a room with three adults (both for three nights).

 October 2017,5,Good Venue for a weekend away,"This is a full service resort and gives you lots of options. It is a perfect place to hang out during the day and explore the beach, golf or lounge and then use the available shuttle for trips into town for dinner. The architecture is different but eventually grows on you - ""flying pigs!"" The staff are helpful and as usual ask a couple different people for directions to the beach. It can be confusing.

 October 2017,3,Feel Disappointed for a luxury hotel,"The friendly staff and the arrival in the lobby gave us a great impression at first. Even more excited when we walked in to the room with a beautiful view and a private terrace. But soon we were disappointed about the cleanliness of the room with a strong smell of humidity. We managed to get another room personally bit head of housekeeping but again when you look in details there are lot of scratches on the floor and the wall, Lamps were not working and the door handle broke shortly after we arrived. I think they have done their best to solve our request however I'm convinced that the rooms need definitely more maintenance and a deep clean.

Special mention to the restaurant crew who're hard workers with nice attitude. The Kids Club (villa des enfants) has been amazing for our kids who loved all their activities there supervised by a great team, again.

The reception staff member on my check-in was fantastic, one of the most delightful and professional individuals I have ever had the pleasure to meet. The room I was allocated was fantastic, with an absolutely stunning view. The bed was huge, and it really dominates the room, as such there is not as much space in the room as I would like. The smooth concrete finish does mean it is easy to scratch by moving furniture, so there are some areas that need touching up. The open shower area is great.

I requested a doctor but was told he would have to take a taxi into Essaouira, not possible in his condition !! Important to note we had only eaten in the Hotel and followed all the rules i.e. Bottled water ect. He is has no allergies and usually has a strong stomach.

The rooms are in desperate need of renovation, or at least the floors need making good. The first room we were shown to was shabby to say the least with the painted floor very marked and peeling and the bathroom stained. We asked for a different room, but this was the same but with the addition of a damp musty smell. We opted for the first room as at least it smelled ok. Over the course of the week we grew to overlook the floor and bathroom and learnt to love it. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the patio was a real sun trap with a very comfy day bed to lounge upon, sheltered slightly from the wind(which is constant making the 30degree heat very bearable). It was a shame there was no…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Apparently all the rooms are the same (according to the reception), with only the view providing the difference. The doors to the bathroom didn't close, the small domestic fridge acting as a mini bar didn't work, an extrodinary design for bathroom itself and fittings that are a throwback to the 1970's. Finally, small details like no glasses or coat hangers in the room didn't add to the experience.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 August 2017,4,Very relaxing - 3rd visit,To put this review into perspective this was our third visit to this hotel. The first visit was for our honeymoon in 2013 - we loved the hotel so much we visited again the following year in 2014. On both occasions we were impressed with the running of the hotel. There were some negative reviews at the time on trip advisor which we disregarded based on the more positive reviews that featured. I would certainly visit the hotel again but I might be more mindful when booking again at looking at the price. The breakfast was great and there was a fantastic range of delicious food to choose from. If you would like an espresso you do need to explain that you would like a shot of coffee otherwise you end up getting a mug of black coffee. The pool area was the same as 2013 & 2014 -…,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

The rooms are modern and stunning, both the pools are calm and peaceful and the hotel grounds itself are beautiful. The hotel is ideally situated just a 7 minute drive from the medina. Its a 15-20 minute walk through the golf to the beach. Would highly recommend checking the beach out. The service is one of the best that we have experienced, whether it be by the pool, at breakfast, at the reception or room service. They are extremely helpful and well trained with a smile on their face. I would recommend one of the rooms on the 2nd floor as the view of the golf course and the sea is mesmerizing. Even the balconies are very well furnished. Looking forward to our next visit!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 August 2017,4,"Super Hotel, lovely spa","We used the hotel throughout our week in Aug 2017 as a ""supporting act"" to our villa which is affiliated. The spa was lovely, my 14 year old son and his friend loved the gym, and Rachid in the pool bar was excellent. He reserved kabanas for us, brought us everything we needed and all the supporting staff were so helpful. Generally the food is OK, I think away from Marrakesh or Casablanca it is difficult to get truly good international cuisine, and Moroccan food isn't a big hit for my family so I cannot criticise the hotel for that. The views and the sunset are truly spectacular and the wind, sometimes really strong, took the edge off the heat. Highly recommend the hotel t stay if you want to spend time in Essaouira",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2016,5,Great Hotel,"One of our favorite resort destinations! Gorgeous location, great service, nice room... relaxing, pretty, luxurious. We very much enjoyed our stay!!!

 July 2017,5,A Slice of Paradise,"I stayed here with my husband and 8 year old son. It was the perfect week. I have stayed in many luxury hotels all over the world but this one was exceptional. What is often present in luxury hotels is beautiful surroundings but not much sense of hospitality. This hotel had both beauty and hospitality in abundance. The staff are really what made it special. There was always a smile, attentiveness to detail, pleasant and informative conversations and discretion where necessary. The staff were very professional and dealt with any requests efficiently and without fuss. We were on a half board basis and the choice and quality was superb. There is a well stocked gym to burn off the extra calories that you might take on board ! The pools were very relaxing with no loud music or…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2017,4,"Pleasant stay, great staff!","The hotel on first impression is luxurious, spacious and light. Our room was lovely, with views onto a garden. However it did smell of damp, but I do know that this can be a problem in Essaouira generally. The facility's are wonderful, from the gym, pools to the gardens. We also enjoyed a wonderful walk to the beach via the golf course. It was a treat to be one of three couples there! The staff I must say are excellent and go beyond the call of duty. The only down side for me was the food. There are many restaurants, but there are few vegetarian options. A waiter proudly told me that they were well used to catering for vegetarians, but when I looked at the menu, it came down to vegetable pizza or pasta with tomato sauce! However, I must say that on the one evening we eat…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2017,2,Fat Sparrows rule - not ok!,"This was once a very nice hotel but I feel that it is already past its best even though it is only 5 years old. There is very little to do in the area except walk around the golf course. The beach is a trek and once there you have to climb over a very large sand dune, but enjoy the camel ride it is good value for money. The restaurant has sparrows flying through the room and I have noticed they also fly into the kitchen. Nobody seems to bother about this particularly the staff but birds contaminate the food. The salads in the evening are kept cool by a fan and I unfortunately along with my husband got food poisoning. There is no atmosphere and an expensive limited bar that you can use in the evening. How this hotel is five star I will never know!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2017,4,Nice villas,"Great villas, well furnished and very well equipped! The view and outdoor area are just perfect!

 June 2017,3,5 * prices without the service or polish,"This hotel is in a stunning setting with beautiful gardens and spacious rooms. Generally has a very quiet and relaxed feel. As I have seen in other reviews this hotel is not 5* - certainly not to UK standards but believe me the prices you are charged are in line with a 5* restaurant in London. A bottle of water is £3.20 and you are advised not to drink tap. On arrival we were provided with two bottles of still water in the room. Despite the promise in the literature of your bed being turned down every evening this only happened on our 5th night - then two bottles of water were left for us. No consistency regarding cleaning of the rooms, for example we were left a face cloth on first day never again.

 June 2017,1,Dont Go - Awful Food Hygiene,"Spent the last week here with my daughter. Along with other guests we became very ill with upset tummies after eating in the restaurant. The food hygeine is extremely poor. Lots of birds in the restaurant, landing and picking at the food while the staff stood by. Food uncovered and unchilled. Bird poo all over the restaurant. My daughter spent 5 days in bed and I started to feel unwell towards the end of the holiday and still feeling very poorly. I felt the restaurant staff were lazy, and more interested in breaking their fast at sundown than attending the guests. The exception was Rachid who worked by the pool. He was the only on who was attentive to guests needs. In addition we got there to find our room was directly below lots of building work which was so noisy. …",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

This hotel offers all attributes to enjoy your holiday to the maximum: beautiful airy rooms with great amenities and a VERY comfy bed (and ordered it as such at home as well:)), 2 wonderful pool areas, a variety of restaurants to choose from with high quality food. To compliment the latter wonderful spa facilities to further relax body and soul. In general from an 'overall perspective' we feel the hotel has grown these past few years as minor flaws in processes have been ironed out and efficiency has further increased.

 April 2017,5,Wonderful Resort Hotel,"We were quite surprised how good this Hotel really is as the photo's on line don't really do it justice. It is a full service Resort / Golf / Spa hotel, in a beautify location a little way out of Essaouira itself. Good pool, couple of good restaurants, good buffet or a la carte breakfast, nice ambience, beautiful rooms, with balconies and views, spectacular bathrooms and good service from the pool bar and restaurant to the a la carte Restaurant for supper. Everything is expensive, but all resorts are expensive and this place offers pretty good value. I would recommend this Hotel very highly if you are going through Essaouira...and you should go there as it is really pretty.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

The villas are decorated in a very modern style, yet warm. The rooms were pristine, quiet with beautiful views of the ocean. We even had a small garden just to ourselves around the swimming pool. The service was attentive and impeccable. The hotel also had great restaurants where we had diner. A truly fantastic experience, highly recommended for couples or families.

 May 2016,5,Holiday time with my daughter,"I decided to take a break with my daughter and booked a holiday with British Airways Holidays and this hotel was available. It was flight and board only however we didn't mind and we like to try out local restaurants rather than eating in hotels. The hotel is lovely, perfect quite location and the pool is overlooking the golfcourse and if you want to go to the beach you can walk or get a golf buggy ride to the private entrance. We enjoyed a lovely sunset walk and had the beach to ourselves apart from the gentleman wanting to take us on a ride with his camels. I was able to play some golf and actually get a golf lesson from the pro at the hotel who was lovely and gave me some great tips that have made my swing better; but I still have a long way to go.

Food in the hotel at breakfast was plentiful, top quality and delightfully served. Tried the ""Aromatic A La Carte"" and the food there was amazing. Room service was also top notch. Golf course is great - greens and fairways in good condition and the view from the 17th hole looking towards the sea was memorable to say the least.

In the summer we had the delight of Rasheed taking care of our every need around the pool, even making sure a Dr came to tend to a small cut on my hand- but upon arrival this time we were disappointed to see the beautiful pools were empty and under renovation - the hotel Manager Karim dealt with our disappointment by giving us a 2 bedroom Villa with our own pool!!

We had been recommended the Sofitel by a couple who had been the year before and we managed to get a great deal with flights direct to Essaouira from Luton, and we were very much looking forward to our trip. The reception area is really well presented and kept well. However the rooms and main restaurants /pool area all seemed to need a large dose of TLC. The restaurant at breakfast was a bit of a free for all and items would run out regularly before the 10am cut off.

This property claims to be a 5 star hotel, which I cannot understand at all! As I arrived at the hotel I was greeted and guided to reception. The lady who took care of me for the check-in procedure was quite brief with me and seemed uninterested! I was not told anything about the hotel and its facilities. And it was my first and probably my last stay in this hotel! I was not even told that there's a complimentary shuttle to downton Essaouira, which I heared from other guests. I took taxis instead.

Very pleasant staff all round and pool gent was just that, a gent. Breakfast sufficient but still can't fathom out why melon was such a rarity. We were half board but went into town 7 out of 10 evening due to being buffet only and no a la carte. Lovely to have a night cap in the bar when we got back. Courtesy bus into town very efficient.

Once you get into your room you notice that the floors, furniture, fixtures, and fitting have had heavy wear and are not well maintained. We had a bed with a very high ridge running down the middle of the bed which made it difficult, if not impossible to keep from rolling off the bed. We had a very uncomfortable night. We wrote a detailed description of the problem, and left the letter with the desk management with a request to repair, or change the mattress, and make it right.

The pool staff are really helpful, especially Rachid who always had a friendly word with us several times a day. As with all hotels like this the prices of food and drinks around the pool are a bit extortionate but you expect that. The breakfast buffet is absolutely amazing.

If the shuttle timingd don't suit you, a taxi costs 50 dirhams (about £3.50). The hotel is well appointed and the staff are very friendly and efficient.

 May 2016,5,A place to see,Fantastic experience. The Hotel was great. Room had a view on the golf which was quite a scenery. The weather was very windy so we couldn't get in the pool. Hotel recommended. The food was delicious and employees very helpful.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Paradise on earth,"After being stuck on the plane for 6 hours instead of a journey that would take 3 hours, and a ride that took us 2 and a half hours from Marrakech to Essaouira. The hotel staff made it all worth it, the driver that took us from the airport to the hotel was absolutely amazing very patient and kind to us. He had been waiting for us through the delays. Getting to the hotel we met amazing people only to remember ones name Ghita, very polite and kind girl. We were stunned at how beautiful this place was. The room we had was very beautiful and amazing view, greeted with tea and nice cakes. I would come back to this hotel again. In the restaurant the waiters and the waitresses were so polite and so helpful, remembering Hamid and Wafa who would deal with is most of the time. At the…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Trip to remember,"If you want to go to a peaceful, quiet and relaxing area this hotel is the best place to be. Had the most amazing week and was treated like royalty by all the staff members. Ghita at the reception was really helpful. At the poolside we had Rachid who also treated us like royalty and told us a lot about the culture of Morrocco had the best time. I would come back again and recommend the place to anyone.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2015,4,Modern Style blends perfectly with Moroccan Culture,"This is a special Hotel not only due to excellent staff, modern design, a golf course and access to an amazing shore line where you truly become at one with nature. The rooms are comfortable with great outdoor space, enjoy a pre dinner drink on the bar terrace and watch the sun go down. Last but not least plenty of fresh, tasty choices of food in the restaurants. We have booked to go back, can't wait.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2016,5,Lovely getaway.,This is a lovely place. The gardens and everything is beautifully set. I loved the peaceful surroundings and nature.

 May 2016,5,For us it is haeven,We wrote already a few times and we are still happy and feel at home when we are there from Arrival untill departure. What we really hope is that tourisme in General in this part will increase it is a great place to be with friendly and authentic People and we never felt unsave. we went to the Festival and it was fantastic (Thanks for the Cards). the atmosphere was great and the Music is very addictive :-). We would like to thanks everybody again for there great effort to make our Holiday again the best one. we are almost Regulars now and I have to say that the Hotel is working on maintenance with a great effort so also that is getting better and better. Laurent please thanks everybody off your staff and see you soon.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2016,3,Mixed emotions,"Firstly, as an architect and a fan of well designed hotels, the trip was a real pleasure. The hotel and pool are truly beautiful. The rooms too are well designed with large balconies great walk-in showers, etc. It's a shame the floor finishes have deteriorated so badly as this is the only thing that compromises the look and feel. The service is also pretty good, as you'd expect from a 4 star hotel but - and this is where the mixed emotions come in - the shortage of occupants seems to have necessitated a cut in staff numbers. A room service tray outside the next room remained uncollected for more than 24 hours and, more importantly, the promised restaurant choices were not available. The only option for dinner was the buffet and, whilst it was a really excellent buffet with…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,Lovely hotel,"our plane was delayed and we did not arrive until 5am. A pot of tea and a sandwich was no problem. On entering the room at this late/early hour we could only say ""Wow"". It was large. The bed was enormous and very comfortable. The balcony was large and had comfortable furniture. Very good shower though was the modern idea with no door. Huge bath tub Other reviewers have commented that the rooms needed refurbishing. Perhaps we were lucky but there was no "" run down "" appearance in our room. Or for that matter around the hotel. 2 bottles of water were supplied daily. The room was perfectly clean. The buffet restaurant was excellent both breakfast and dinner. Superb choice providing you do not want chips and fast food. The sun loungers around the pool were very comfortable and…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2016,4,Would stay here again,"We stayed here through a deal on Secret Escapes - fantastic deal for what we got. The hotel it's self is beautiful, the grounds are lovely with great sunbeds and pools. The beach is a 25 minute walk through the gold course and is beautiful - we pretty much had the beach to ourselves and you could walk along to the town if you wanted to. We were half board, there was a fantastic variety of food with different dishes every evening. The best was the Moroccan night on Saturdays, the breakfasts were good - big selection of fruit/pancakes/cooked etc. We normally stay as close to town as possible but here you are about 15 minute drive out of the centre, the free shuttle bus that leaves every hour makes it so easy to pop in for lunch or a look around the shops. We had dinner out one…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for a week bed and breakfast. The hotel and rooms are really nice, it could do with a bit of a refurbishment, but on the whole a great hotel with loads of sunbeds, and very helpful staff. The breakfast was amazing and so were the dinners. We would definitely return.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2016,4,"Nice hotel, excellent customer service, but room for improvement.","We stayed here in a superior room on a half board basis for 10 nights in May 2016. We flew to Marrakech which is nearly 3 hours taxi ride from the hotel, so a good tip for anyone visiting this hotel would be to fly to the local airport at Essaouira if possible. On arrival, our taxi was checked for (I assume) explosive devices before being allowed to enter the grounds of the hotel. We were offered Moroccan mint tea whilst check in formalities were completed. I think I'd have enjoyed it more had it been hot and fresh when we arrived. Our room was at the far end of the resort next to the Spa. It was a good size with plenty of storage space. The lack of any kind of shower curtain made it difficult to keep the water contained to just the shower area. We were on the ground…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 August 2015,3,A strong 4* but no 5*,"My boyfriend and I spent a week here in August 2015; we booked through Voyage Prive, all inclusive - which in the end was great value compared to the nightly rate we noted in the room. Our room was on the ground floor next to the natural pool; it was easy to access breakfast and the other pool area from here. We had a lovely outside area with a comfortable sofa. The room itself was lovely the biggest downfall the toilet door; it was a floor to ceiling piece of glass, the handle a small protruding slab of glass that fell from it's fixture four times - makes it difficult to use the bathroom if you can't get in. The general wear and tear within the rooms are noticeable, but the rooms are extremely well cleaned, so it doesn't pose too much of a problem - just not nice to look…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,Quiet but incredibly friendly and welcoming,"We stayed four days at a time when the wet weather was of the kind not seen (apparently) for many a year and I until see anyone on the golf course during our stay. The hotel seemed quiet in terms of occupation which on the one hand was pleasant but also meant apart from one night when there was entertainment there was little atmosphere or clientele in the bar after our evening meal. Nevertheless all of the staff were incredibly friendly, very attentive and always had a smile. I'd like to return again for a chilled holiday when the weather was better.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,Amazing Experience,"We stayed there for 8 nights.

Looking forward to visiting here again in near future!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2016,5,A room with a view,"This resort is located about 10 minutes from the Medina in Essaouira, but it is very easy to get taxis to get to town, the rooms are HUGE and very well appointed , we selected a golf view room, and we had a great view of both the golf course and the sea. The breakfast had a large selection and the service was very good, room service was prompt and very good as well. I strongly recommend if you want to be in a luxury 5 star hotel which is a very nice contrast if you have stayed in small Riads while in Morocco. The rooms had some details but nothing major to complain about",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2016,4,Nice hotel,Overall our stay was very pleasant and vey relaxing. People in the hotel were very nice and very helpful especially Aziz our butler.

 April 2016,5,A beautiful hotel.,"This was our second trip to this hotel we enjoyed our stay in Nov 2015 so much we booked again in April 2016.

Everything so well organised beautiful grounds, golf course and pool area. Very helpful friendly staff.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2016,1,Horrible place,"We arrived last night to a filthy bedroom. There was a dirty cotton bud on the floor, dried snot on the bedside lampshade, the rugs had not been hoovered and the floor was grubby. The shower didn't work properly, neither did the phone, and the radio didn't work at all. Eventually changed rooms to a slightly cleaner one. The initial impression of this hotel is of a newish hotel is of beautiful modern design. But it soon becomes clear that it is already shabby and badly maintained, with all the furnishings and floors either chipped, stained and dirty. The management is AWFUL. Half the staff are charming and helpful, half are surly and unhelpful. The food is very good, but our breakfast table was sticky with previous meals that had not been wiped away properly and the dining room…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 April 2016,5,Perfect for relaxing,"We had a weeks break here from 13th April. The food was excellent and the staff very attentive. Rachid around the pool is treated like dirt but does his very best which is superb. If it wasn't for him this could have ruined our holiday. He certainly looked after us. Nadia at reception was also superb and dealt with all of our queries even giving us a personal guided tour. Thank you nadir and Rashid. The food was superb as I am a fussy eater but never had one sub standard meal. The chefs were brilliant. Waiting staff good. The only downside was the price of the beer.....£7 for a small bottle....but for a bit of advice, go into town and stock up. Don't get caught out with the minibar. Overall, a superb and highly recommended holiday. Well done Sofitel.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2016,3,Lovely staff. Nice facilities. Unfortunate relationship with Voyage Prive.,"The Sofitel was nice. The poolside staff (go Rachid!) and the front desk staff (Thanks Nadia!) were really kind. I'd like to give the hotel 4 stars as it's tidy & swanky (gorgeous seating everywhere) and *even* provided a babysitter on three last-minute occasions (again, GO NADIA!), but frankly a few things went haywire with our Voyage Prive booking that the experience can't really warrant the 4 stars. I've spoken at length to both Voyage Prive (the incidents are still under investigation) and the hotel and neither are yet taking responsibility. Parents be warned: We arrived and were forced into an upgrade for joined rooms even though I called VP to request these rooms. The hotel also said that they can usually do this provided surnames are matching (ours were), but apparently…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2016,5,A special place for calm and relaxation.,This was our first time at this hotel and it certainly won't be our last. From the outset we were looked after superbly well by the efficient and friendly ( but not too intrusive ) staff..Rachid at the pool especially. We had a sea view room on the top floor and the view was magnificent. Half board we found was a good idea because the hotel is out of town and the food is exceptional. The transfer into town is regular and quick however. The grounds of the hotel are vast..it takes 25 mins to walk to the dunes and the beach where we saw a baby camel. You can hire a bike to tour the grounds also which I thoroughly enjoyed but the main reason for our stay was to relax and visit Essaouira ( which is a delight ). The Moroccan evening in the So lounge was good fun and altogether we had…,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Great service and views, free shuttle into the town, they couldn't do enough for you, food was delicious.

 February 2016,5,Magical,From welcome to departure a wonderful experience. We hope to return. Beautiful spacious room with terrace and fabulous view. Even more spacious shower.

 November 2015,4,Try better..,"It was the third time I went to this hotel which used to be my favourite one. For relaxation and Spa, taking some time out from job and family. For sure, the place is a really magic & wonderful place and I love the design of the hotel. But this time (in November) I was really disappointed: pool was not heated, shuttle to Medina unreliable, some staff rather unfriendly. But the worse experience was that I (female, staying alone) did not feel comfortable, as some waiters tried to get in more private contact with me : asking for my phone number, where my husband was, wanted to go for a cafe and so on. Come on, Sofitel - REALLY?? I've been to several Sofitels around the globe but this has never occurred to me. Furthermore: I booked half-board.

 April 2016,4,"""Loved it - we'll be back to this hotel in Africa's ""windy"" city!""","This was the exactly the getaway we were looking for. The hotel is an oasis in the middle of a beautiful stretch of bushland - 20 mins walk from a very windy beach. Most days we lay by the 2 huge pools on one of the huge day beds. Heaven! When you feel a bit more adventurous, it's about 10 mins by taxi to the Medina (50Dhs) - Internet good throughout the hotel. Although we'll definitely be returning, there was also a few simple things that we think could be easily be improved to bring the hotel to 5 star rating - - We felt like we were constantly pestering housekeeping for more drinking water! Only two, small free bottles were provided free per day (if any). Everyday we'd ask for more... and more. Housekeeping in general seemed over run - with plates and trays staying…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2016,3,Luxurious hotel but lacking certain things,"Currently staying at this hotel. It is really beautiful, one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in except for one or two things. The rooms could really benefit from tea/coffee making facilities. If you are an early riser you gave to wait until the restaurant is open at 7am before you can get a drink. Today we have been in our room since 1pm because of gale force winds and will have to go and hunt down somewhere to get a drink before the restaurant opens again at 7pm. Coffee etc is served at the pool bar but at £3 per half a cup (which is all you get!) it works out quite expensive over 7 days. The food in the evening buffet is quite bad, usually luke warm and doesn't look particularly appetising. The starters and deserts are ok, consequently we have had salad the last…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2016,3,Nice hotel,The hotel is nice but the staff did nothing to help. There was problems with the room and it took them a long time to move us even though the hotel was not full. The mini bar was empty and they did not notice it until I pointed it out as I did not want to be charged for it. Also it does not have a business center.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2016,4,Nice hotel!,On arriving at the hotel we was greeted by a young receptionist he showed around the hotel and took us to our room. The room was lovely I couldn't fault it view was lovely however I can imagine it might be noisy during summer time as we was above the bar. In my opinion I was disappointed with the house keeping a tray was left in our room for two days I had to put it on someone room service trolley the drinking glasses was never clean I also placed the card on my bed for clean bed sheets but never got them. I couldn't fault the staff especially Richard (not sure if that's spelt right) from the pool bar he was so friendly and always made an effort to come and talk to us.

 March 2016,5,"Excellent staff, great property","I can't commend the staff enough: they made a short relaxation stay after an intense business meeting in Marrakech memorable. In particular Mehti, the barman, deserves special recognition -- friendly, attentive, and personable: he is a star. As I visited in the off-season, all the facilities were not operational (e.g., one of the pools was not available, some of the restaurants were not open, etc.), but that's not too surprising. It would've been nice if the pool was heated: it was a bit on the brisk side but I imagine this isn't much of a problem in the summer. If I ever get back to Essaouira, I'll most likely stay at the Sofitel again.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 February 2016,5,Superb Hotel,"A 7 night stay at this beautifully located hotel in Essaouira. Amazing views from our room, upgraded to Sea view room.

Beautifully landscaped gardens and trails around golf course (perfect for running/walking) with stunning flowers and trees and wildlife. A perfect hotel for some Moroccan culture, exceptional customer service and a really relaxing holiday! The free hourly shuttle from the hotel to town and back (10mins drive) was a real bonus and always on time. Essaouira itself is a lovely town with some great shops and market stalls - and nothing like the hassle you can experience in Marrakesh, a much more enjoyable experience we found!

This hotel is a gem!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 December 2015,4,Great Location and Views,"We spent three nights here after being in the medina at Marrakech and it was just the right complement. Since there were three of us, it wasn't that much more expensive than two rooms to get a private villa. Great decision. The extra space and the private pool were definitely worth it. The facilities are impressive although a freshen up would get rid of the 'tired' feel in some areas. One of the showers had only a trickle of water coming through because the shower head hadn't been cleaned for a while. It took three reminders to get the room safe working (needed batteries). The staff try to be helpful but it seems more a question of management systems. Overall still 4 stars soft the location, views and helpful staff. Just needs a bit of attention to make it outstanding.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

For some readers this might sound boring...however when the heart has found a home away from home.... This has particularly to do with the fact that the people working in the hotel take pride in doing so - every single employee is a true ambassador for the Sofitel and this brings an extra quality. We experienced if there is anything more to wish for as a guest or something minor to improve immediate action is taken on all levels.

We were greeted with mint tea, and the staff were very courteous and polite. We had organised a quad bikng trip later in our stay, independently of the hotel, but then could not find the location, the concierge very helpfully contacted the company for us and had them collect us from the hotel.

If you come with kids or as a party of 4 adults, think of staying at 2 bedroom villas with private butler. Great gastronomic restaurant with fine a la carte menu made by French Chef. Staff is skilled and international, many specialists from France (at the reception, restaurants). Local professionals are very well trained.

We had one free massage treatment and hamaam at the spa as part of our package and it was well worth it. Hotel was very spacious however felt closed off from the main town Marrakech. Food was okay but we went out to the Old Medina in Essaouira during the evenings, so it was hard to judge the hotel's food.

This time it's just the three of us. What's good to see is that, despite being less busy than in past years, the property continues to be very well maintained. What's a little disappointing is that, even though there are lots of staff around, service is more hit-and-miss: one day coffe is offered to you at breakfast, others you need to stand in line and order for yourself, as well as find cuttelary. A simple salad can take 45 minutes to be served. Spa treatments vary from poor to excellent (ask for Anna).

 June 2015,4,Lovely relaxing Break,"Easyjet flies to here from London direct now, so I jumped at the chance of a short break with almost guaranteed sun. The Sofitel was the right choice for this at just 15 from the airport, lovely pool area and views. We stayed in a deluxe room and it was worth the upgrade for the space and views. The breakfast buffet had a huge choice with lots of local dishes as well as international favourites. Staff were attentive and seemed to actually enjoy serving. The hotel was only half capacity at the time of travelling though. The common areas, especially the lobby were so impressed and really relaxing. The rooms were great also, but a little tired about the edges in terms of loose tiling and drippy shower. Aside from that a great value stay with a fantastic spa.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 December 2015,5,"If it was closer to the beach it would have been the best, but it's still great!","The hotel is a bit away from Essaouira and you need a car to get to town and the beach (it's not that far but I think it would be tiring to walk all the way there and back). It is in a very quiet, very green place. The hotel is quite new and the premises are in excellent condition. Unfortunately the beach is about 20 minutes walk from the hotel, so not that convenient but still, it's there. There was a pool but in December it was a bit too cold for us to swim.

We were bed and breakfast and the bed was large, soft and comfortable, while the breakfast was plentiful and varied with almost everything you would wish for including freshly made pancakes, eggs any style and so on and yes, there were a few birds flying in and out. It was very quiet in the first week of December-more staff than guests. Service was excellent, the staff were genuinely interested in guests. The room did have a few quirky aspects, regarding lighting, and plumbing, and some redecorations were necessary. We ate a la carte in the restaurant twice and the food was tremendous. More expensive than town,…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,Memorable for mostly the right reasons,"Having been moved by our travel agent from a 5 star all inclusive holiday in Sharm El Sheik to the Sofitel Essaouira Mogador, we were a little nervous as we had no idea what the resort /area was like and we were downgrading to half board. We contacted the staff at the hotel in advance and they were very nice, helpful and accommodating. On arriving at the hotel itself we were greeted with Moroccan tea and macarons, which I believe is standard, but an excellent touch. It did take a while to get our room sorted out due to some mix-ups at the front desk, but when we finally got to our second floor sea view room with king sized bed, we were surprised and delighted with the facilities and views across the swimming pool, golf course and out to the ocean in the distance. If I remember…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 January 2015,5,A glamorous hotel,Stayed here earlier in 2015 Lovely hotel with a good shuttle bus into Essaaouira The room we had had the real wow factor with a lovely grassed terrace opening onto the golf course Great food and good service and a pool to die for,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,Exceptional,"We had wanted to go to Morocco for a long time but did not really fancy Marrakesh. When we found the deal for the Sofitel Essaouria Mogador G&S, we read all the reviews for the hotel and things to do in the area. Whilst there were quite a few negative comments of the hotel in terms of the service and maintenance, etc I also took the positive comments into account. We have stayed at other Sofitels before in the past and have always found them to be top class. It was no different this time. We were at the Sofitel Essaouira Mogador for 7 nights at the beginning of November and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The lobby area is stunning and whilst there is the odd scratch here and there around places, that does not take away anything from the hotel which is only a few years…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,One of the best sofitel ever visited. Everything amazing.,First when you enter you see a amazing huge hotel and you think that is it the right place or am I mistaken. Have I came to the wrong place because this is not what I expected. The staff is really friendly and the room was huge. Amazing pool and can book great tours at a good price for you. Loved the swimming pool by the way,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 November 2015,4,Little improvements would make a big difference,"The location of this hotel is quite magnificent overlooking its swimming pools, deck areas, gardens and with a golf course running virtually to the beach and the ocean beyond. A free minibus service runs every hour to and from the small fishing port of Essaouria just 10 minutes away. The food here and the service is good as you would expect from this chain. However, we didn't really like the constant piped music which was too loud for our taste and present in every public space. A quiet time on our balcony was invaded by hidden speakers in the flower beds beneath us. When building this hotel they decided to leave the corridor and bedroom floors in painted concrete and as my pictures show this gives a dirty look in the showers and elsewhere. A welcome letter given to us on…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2015,5,Sublime,"This was a pleasant accidental booking, thought we were going to Marrakech but arrived to find that this was 2.5 hours away! After a strenuous journey, this hotel turned out to be a blessing. Staff was great, excellent food and modern in such a historic town. Five minute drive away from the Port.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,Amazing luxury at a bargain price,"I have been lucky enough to stay in lots of nice hotels all around the world but I have to say this is the best place we have ever stayed. From the moment you pull up to the hotel you get the impression that it is going to be something special - the grounds and the building are very stylish and contemporary. We arrived early, before midday, yet our room was ready and we felt welcome straight away (a nice cup of Moroccan tea and some macaroons helped!). The room itself was fabulous - very spacious and decorated in a contemporary style. It had a huge bed in the centre of the room, a walk-in shower and large flat screen TV. Others have mentioned the bed and they weren't exaggerating.The view from the spacious balcony was equally amazing, overlooking the gardens, the golf course and…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2015,5,Majestic,"My girlfriend and I got a package deal for this hotel to celebrate the end of our exams and it was the most luxurious, relaxed and comfortable holiday I have ever had! The staff are wonderful, their commitment to your happiness and comfort is commendable on so many levels. Their english and general manners are impeccable and they were helpful in every way they could be. They assisted us in booking experiences with local companies, recommended great things to do and didnt even blink when we decided to use someone elso over their offered activities. HOWEVER, I would clarify that this hotel is ideal for a relaxing and pampering holiday (and presumably for golf, personally i don't play). Those looking for a particularly adventurous holiday might want to consider a Marrakech…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,4,Good hotel!,Stayed here in October with my best friend for a 4 day getaway. The weather was very generous with lots of sun and therefore we spent a lot of time lazing by the po Logistics - A transfer from the airport was also provided free of charge. On our arrival in the airport we were greeted by the driver and after a quick 10 minute journey we arrived at the hotel. Check in was very quick and although we arrived at 11am we did not have to wait for our room. We were gifted with Moroccan tea and pastries whilst they dealt with the check in specifics (passport copies etc) and then we were given a quick tour en route to our room. A slight mix up when we were given our room which had a king size bed was quickly resolved and we were moved to a room with twin beds quickly (ensure that…,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,An elegant resort near an historic town,"Hotel has an elegant modern design, and a large expanse of property overlooking golf course and Atlantic. Rooms are comfortable and our balcony had an exquisite perspective on the sunsets. Food is quite good (the duck breast, lamb and monkfish were superb) and it is an excellent spot to come for a rest - or for some golf or some time around the two outdoor swimming pools (one of them heated). There's an hourly shuttle to Essaouira - which is definitely worth exploring. And there are many kids and facilities for entertaining kids while their parents get in some R&R. Definitely a good place to stay and rest.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,great surroundings and beautiful contemporary hotel,"Hotel is well designed with beautiful modern, yet traditional touch interiors. Pool is great and heated. Food is extra-class, breakfast is really planty. Staff is helpful and polite. Rooms are spacious with big balconies. Some of the rooms were renovated at the time we were there. Villas are beautiful, yet atleast few of those were messy inside and unused, dont know why they are not kept ready for guests.WIFI was working well. Price -wise the hotel is slightly overpriced. But then again: all Sofitels are...",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,4,Great hotel.,"We stayed here for 2 nights after Marrakech. It is quite a long drive, and we didn't love Essaouira, but were glad we had a nice hotel. Hotel located about 10 minutes from town centre. Hotel has free shuttle bus running hourly 10 - 6. Half board entitled us to buffet breakfast and dinner, but we had to pay for lunch. For buffet, food was very good. We had a King Deluxe room with golf view and it was fantastic. Huge bed, waterfall shower, balcony to watch the sunset. Lovely hotel. if anything, they could do with better information. If you don't speak French, it was difficult to understand where anything was, what your lunch options were etc.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,4,GREAT LOCATION,"We booked a weeks holiday,having stayed at other Sofitels in Marrakesh and Agadir. Our Room 147 was great not in the main body of the Hotel but a single storey room that opened out onto a wonderful grassy area. The room was very well designed as Sofitel do so well. Bedding, Towels, Robes excellent quality, wonderful nights sleep. The Hotel had two pools, and an 18 hole golf course, beyond the Golf Course was the sea a 20 minute walk from the Hotel through the grounds to a natural beach with no facilities other than a few camels. Hotel supply towels for the beach. The Hotel run a courtesy bus (hourly and free) into Town but that stops at 6pm. Would have been better to run into the evening, so that you could eat in Essaouria itself. Downside for us was the food,…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2015,5,"Gorgeous hotel, amazing deal, and most relaxing vacation",The hotel was excellent and beautifully decorated to say the least! We bought an all inclusive deal for 7 nights and can not complain about one thing besides how much Argon oil is used in all of their dishes. We made full use of the spa and golf course. If we can find a deal like the one we bought for this hotel we will most definitely be coming back every year.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2015,4,aNNIVERSARY TRIP,"Lovely hotel but needs a refresh. Fabulous room with luxury bed. Excellent variety of food in restaraunts, but staff a little slow. Would recommend Great location for exploring Essariou Would revisit for a relaXING SUNSHINE BREAK",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,4,Great Property with some minor issues,"We had booked 4 nights on B&B with the Sofitel own website as a single mum with 2 daughters in a Deluxe room with extra bed. The first impression upon arrival was already overwhelming....the lobby is beautifully decorated wit different seating areas in different styles, overlooking the main pool area and the golf course up to the ocean. Check-in was very friendly and efficient and our rental car was parked by valet parking. After the warm welcome with a mint tea we were quickly guided into our room on the garden level which we had requested. The room was spacious (46 m2) and at the first glance nicely appointed. The terrace was fully furnished though the cushions and the furniture had a lot of spots and looked already worn. To cut a long story short we had some issues with…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2015,4,A completely new experience in Morocco and a superbly relaxing break!,"We stayed here on half board in July. The hotel is very modern and stylish, our room was a good size and comfortable with ample storage. Only complaint regarding the room was a lack of tea and coffee making facilities, my husband did ask for a kettle and was told they would try, it never arrived. The pool area is clean and well maintained. The staff here are extremely hospitable and were quick to adjust your parasol, bring towels or take orders. As many have commented Rachid was an outstanding member of staff. We ate a lot at the hotel. Breakfast was great, very good choice. Fresh fruits, juices, freshly made crepes and omelettes. Coffee was sometimes a little slow to arrive, possibly more to do with the machine than service. Lunch at the Atlantic restaurant was…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Great Hotel and Hospitality,"Stayed in the Sofitel with my wife for a week and had lovely time. From the moment that Brahim personally collected us at Marrakech Airport and chauffered us in an air-conditioned 4 x 4 for the two hour drive to the hotel, we were treated like loyalty. I have stayed at many five star hotels but the service provided at the Sofitel is second to none. Staff go out of their way to cater for your needs, they don`t let you lift a finger and at first seemed a bit over-whelming but over the course of the week you could quite easily get used to it! All the staff were very friendly, professional and attentive - in particular I would especially like to thank: Brahim, Michael, Rachid, Fatima and Farhat who are an asset to the hotel. I felt very safe in this hotel and the security…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 September 2015,5,Relaxation Heaven,This is our third trip to Essaouira and the Sofitel. We flew from Luton direct to Essaouira airport. This was brilliant as in previous years the transfer from Marrakech is about two and a half hours. This time we were at the hotel in 15 minutes. We had the usual warm welcome and the staff worked very hard to check that we were happy with everything. We stayed by the pool most days and were well looked after by Rachid and his colleagues. It was heaven. Quiet and relaxing. We also visited the Spa for the Hammam and massages which were amazing. Yousef and his staff work hard to create a great experience. I agree with the other comments that the hotel is away from the main town but that's another reason we love it. It's so peaceful. The town is only 10 mins away and Taxis are…,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Excellent hotel,"After a very poor experience at the Sofitel Marrakech we wondered what we would find at the Sofitel Essaouira. Overall the hotel was excellent, with staff that gave high quality service and always seemed to care about guests. Managers regularly checked if guests were happy and made sure that the high standards were maintained. The location is out of town so there is not much nightlife out of the hotel, which is not a problem. The town is a cheap taxi ride if an alternative is needed. Rooms are modern, well equipped and spacious, but you if want traditional style this is not for you. The hotel looks over a golf course with views to the sea and is great for walking, golf or just relaxing near to the large pool. Food is very good, especially the seafood Atlantic restaurant.…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2015,5,Perfect one night stay in Essaouira!,"One of the most beautiful we have ever been to.

Food at the Atelier des Arômes was wonderful mixing in a perfect way french cuisine and moroccan traditional spices. I Will definitely come back",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2015,4,Nice hotel but a little away from the city,"Lovely hotel, rooms are nice and big, good sized and spacious balconies too. Breakfast was amazing as well too much to choose from. Only downside i feel was the Location and no real access to beach. We were told we could walk to the beach from the hotel but the golf course is so huge and in the end i think we got lost and after 30 mins gave up and returned back to the hotel. They are no signs or nothing as to how to walk to the beach. I think the hotel should offer a drop off to the beach if anyone wants in the little cars they use around the golf course. The medina is about 15 mins away and you can't walk to it for sure. The hotel does provide Shuttles which is great however the last shuttle is around 6 pm so which means if you want to go and have dinner in the medina than you…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

The restaurant serves an imaginative range of food with good service.Overal this is exactly what we hoped for.The shuttle service is essential and the driver should be commended for always being there on time.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 July 2015,4,Great Hotel and staff,"We enjoyed a wonderful week at the Sofitel and were most impressed with the hotel, the room, facilities and the helpful staff. The rooms were of a good size and the bed was probably the best we have encountered. We only sampled the main (buffet) restaurant but found the choice and quality both of a high standard. The pool is very large and super for swimming, with an adjacent pool for children. The golf course separates the hotel from the dunes/beach which are a 20 minute steady walk away. In iur view, the beach did not nustify the walk; although it was a pleasant stroll across the golf course. Essaouira is a short taxi journey away although the hotel provide a free and regular minibus service from the hotel and back. It takes abiut 10 minutes or so. Taxis are readily…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2015,4,Wonderful Hotel but too remote.,"Got to the hotel around 1am after a gruelling 3 hour transit by cab from Marrakech airport. Transit time was almost longer than flight time. Best to fly direct to Essaouira but Easyjet does not fly there from Bristol. Note : - you need to fill out a Disembarkation Card for Customs. Easyjet did not mention this so we were all scrambling for cards in Arrivals. Based on TripAdvisor comments and the fact there was no explanation regarding the bottled water in the room (not in the fridge) we made do with what we had from the flight. The following morning, we asked the maid for water and 2 small bottles were left in the fridge. We subsequently found we were being charged for this water. On questioning hotel reception, they removed the charge and we were told we should have 1…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,It's fantastic!,"Last night was our first night home, and boy, did I miss that enormous Sofitel bed! We had a week in this hotel and it was just brilliant. I'd read some of the reviews before going, and yes, it's not brand new and there are some little things that aren't perfect - the painted pathways could do with a touch up and the decking around the pool could do with a makeover. But get past that because this hotel is really lovely. We had a superior villa and it was delightful. The biggest bed in front of patio doors, funky, bright Moroccan colours, separate toilet and shower, robes, slippers, hairdryer, Bose TV and CD player, fridge/mini bar safe and brilliant air con (safe and air con complimentary). They really have thought of everything you could need. Breakfast was amazing - again,…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,Refreshed and Energised!,"In short: the GOOD (surely no bad) and then the remaining ‚ugly’ would definitely be the extra kilos we’ve gained. Anyway.... here’s the short version of how great it was in the Sofitel! People, ambiance, service level all welcoming and in balance. The food somehow lighter in approach and well presented. In ’Les Aromes’ little ‚paintings’ on your plate: confusing ... ‚should I eat it – but is looks so cute’. Great interaction with staff and head cheff. Combined with a great selection of wine .... mmjamm (we published pictures on Facebook and got envy responses from friends☺). However we do feel that Sofitel should offer guests at least two dinner options, at all times – even in ‚low’ season. We both went several times to the SO Spa for facials, hands and feets resulting in a…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2015,5,A little piece of paradise!,"This is our second stay at Sofitel Mogador. We visited in July 2014 and were blown away by the hotel's sleek, modern styling, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff and the quality of the food and accommodation. Although the decor is a tiny bit more tired than last year, we have not been disappointed and have been thrilled to stay at this spotless, beautiful hotel again! For gym lovers, there is a small gym with Technogym equipment, whilst for those who like to keep up with their social networks there is constant (free but not superfast) wifi to occupy you as you bronze yourself by the main/biological pools, Bali beds, or in fact, anywhere around the hotel!

Once into our room we couldn't believe the great view we had from our very spacious balcony, room was very clean with massive queen size bed, shower and bath, ipod Bose system & mini bar.

Really great staff, and the pools guys (especially Rachid) did a wonderful job of making our stay comfortable. Nice Spa too and lovely grounds. The minor downsides are 1. it is a little worn in some places, but it's hard to keep perfect considering the geography/weather - but saw plenty of maintenance work going on 2. The natural pool is very cold and slippy - didn't really bother us, but just be warned 3. The Spa is lovely, the gym doesn't have much kit, so don't expect a mega workout 4.

There were a few cracks etc, but nothing major or complaint-worthy. The staff are so courteous and helpful, and they handled problems such as someone using our room number for their tab with such excellence and professionalism.

Our room was a good size and the beds were extremely comfortable. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We stayed half board and the food was very good throughout the 2 weeks with a good variety on offer. They will also cater for any individual dietary requirements. Loubna (waitress) in the restaurant was excellent and made our meal times very relaxing as she always made sure we had everything that we needed.

 August 2015,5,Outstanding hotel with great staff and beautiful surroundings!,"We stayed at Sofitel Essaouira for 10 days, and though we felt there wasn't much to do in Essaouira itself and we had done everything more or less in 2-3 days, the hotel was fantastic and obviously I base my review on the hotel alone. We were worried having read some negative reviews over the last few months however these are really unfounded from our experience. Yes there is the odd scuff on a wall or damage to a bit of paint...but you really need to be pedantic to let this annoy you, not many hotels are 100% perfect unless brand new.

Large TV and iPod speaker base so you can listen to own music. We had half board and the breakfast choice was outstanding,kept us going all day. In the evening we ate Moroccan food every night but if you wanted there was Italian or Chinese wok food. There was loads of food - we had the equivalent of a four course meal!

There is nothing to do except relax and if you want play golf but the hotel is very caring and although the staff English is restricted they work hard to make your stay pleasant. A number of people to mention, the helpful and intelligent Rachid by the pool, attentive and delightful to chat with, the gentle giant Louis at the golf club who couldn't have been nicer and the brilliant Claude the Samuel L Jackson look a like who was charming itself.

Foyer and reception is stunning. In general the hotel is beautifully done, but starting to look like some maintenance would not go amiss - just silly things like the door handle in the main restaurant toilet being broken the whole week we were there but people were getting stuck everyday! Pool area was nice and sun loungers were lovely but there were not enough to go round which made it a race to the pool every morning. My main gripe was probably the service.

You can always get them to reserve a table if the place gets crowded.The evening bar area has the slowest service in the world! The hotel itself has been, in it's day, luxurious, and to some extent still is. However certain areas are beginning to look tired and in need of care.

 August 2015,5,Relaxing holiday,"Lovely hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were a good size and the pool was nice and big! Food was delicious. Spa was excellent. Only disappointment was the gym. Gym is small and lacks equipment. The beach is about 2.5km walk away from the main hotel buildings. The walk is pleasant as you cut through the golf course. However, there are no sun loungers or a permanent structures set-up at the beach. There is security to check who is coming and going which makes you feel safe.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Summer break,We spent 4 days in essaouira and we had a really great time. We received a warm welcome and were offered some tea with traditional sweets as well as tour of the hotel. Staff was always around and quick to help with a good level of French or English. Food is quite nice even at the pool bar. A special thanks to adrien who give us some good advice on a walk and town. And the pool boy (cap and red shirt) who was still smiling and ready to help after a long shift under the sun.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,"Great Hotel, Great Food, Great Staff - Relaxing week in Essaouira","We stayed between 24/07-31/07 and were half board. Quick tip - we flew from Luton straight into Essaouira airport which is only around 15 mins transfer. If you fly into Marrakesh, it is a much longer transfer. Arrival - The currency is only traded in Morocco so you cannot bring more than 1000 MAD into the country (£75) - so exchange when you get there (although they do not take cards at the airport so bring sterling). There is a cash machine at the hotel so you can wait to use this if you have no cash on arrival. Location - The hotel is set away from the town and if you are expecting to be able to walk anywhere for sights or supermarkets then you will be disappointed. You can walk through the golf course which leads to the sand dunes but no beach to sit on as such. Check In -…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 August 2015,5,Summer break,"The site is simply wonderful with amazing golf greenery and sea view. We've come as 4 families and spent amazing time. We had adjacent rooms on a shared garden and terraces with direct view on the golf and sea. Staff is very friendly. To make the 5 star feel even better, I would recommend some simple adds like boiler with tea and coffee bags to offer the guest a memorable tea break in front of sunset. I will definitely recommend the hotel to my friends and thanks to all the team for your care",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2015,5,Relaxing holiday,I'd like to say that we thought the hotel and the staff were excellent. Really friendly vibe and relaxed atmosphere. From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for you. They spent time to get to know their guests and were very pleasant. The food was varied and tasted good. The shuttle into town was convenient and we enjoyed exploring the town for a couple of afternoons. We also booked quad-biking through the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it - I'd go so far as to say it was the best experience of the holiday. The spa was stunning and the treatments were worth every dirham. The golf course was equally beautiful and my partner enjoyed playing the course and the driving range. The only thing that could be improved upon is the decor in our room…,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

On arrival we were welcomed in the impressive lobby with fresh mint tea, hot towels and a French macaron! These were nice touches. Margo (spelling?) was a French intern who showed us around and to our room, and she was exceptionally friendly and helpful. ROOM Our room was beautiful and spacious, with a huge bed, and was decorated colourfully and stylishly. Patio doors opened on to our own private terrace which was set in a grassy area with the gold course and sea in the distance. It felt really private and secluded.

If you can opt up and are with family its a good way to go! This meant we didn't use the main pool much but when we did go there service and attention was on top form - a special mention to Rachid for going the extra mile and reuniting me with my sunhat which blew away in the notorious Essaouiran breeze - he literally hurled himself down the side of a building on a rescue mission! Great hotel, charming friendly staff who went out of their way to make you comfortable.

Tips to future guests and improvements that would make the establishment 5 stars include: - 1. If travelling from Marrakesh make certain you have a few Dirhams with you as the driver on the way to the hotel stopped off for a break/meal 2. Book a villa - especially if you are in group of 3 or more... 3. Please can the Turndown service in the evening be done whilst guests are having their dinner rather than when they are getting changed for dinner 4.

Rooms are spacious, the beds superbly comfortable, the meals abundant, the surroundings tranquil and attractive.

I travel a lot for work and stay in hotels frequently, but never any with such a perfect mix of luxury and friendly staff. The hotel is clean, well kept, and the staff are all very helpful, with nothing being too much trouble. Our rooms were perfectly prepared each day. The hotel is set on large grounds, with beautiful views. It's about 10 minutes drive from the medina and there are regular shuttle services laid on by the hotel. The pool area is second to none, with a great atmosphere and again very helpful staff. Only complaint was a lack of English breakfast tea, Irish isn't quite the same! But not a show stopper.

I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel to anyone, be they a couple, a family or just an individual looking for a short, quiet break (all of which we met on holiday). The rooms (we had a Superior Room) were large and airy with a huge, comfortable bed and French doors leading to a grassy veranda, The Café Kasbah restaurant, where breakfast and dinner is served, was lovely and clean with a very good selection of food for both meals. Each evening there were a few different dishes being served up fresh, but always a selection of Moroccan tagines, all of which were wonderfully tasty. We, like most people, were on half board, so…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2015,4,Good but......,"Although this was a lovely hotel with wonderful facilities and made a great first impression, some of the design features and service let it down. They have tried hard to design a luxury hotel and our upgraded room was large and well equipped with a great view of the pool, golf course and sea beyond. The bed was large and comfortable, however although the double bath was a great feature it took ages to fill particularly as the funky taps just kept turning themselves off. The opaque glass toilet door again looked good but did not provide a lot of privacy. There was also a Bose sound system but despite having the correct fitting my iphone 4 would not connect with it so it was wasted. Service was very friendly and generally very helpful but again there were a couple of problems:…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 September 2014,2,Substandard. Definitely not 5*.,"My partner and I booked a week here as a last minute trip through a very reputable travel company who we have had excellent service and holidays with previously. We were expecting a relaxing holiday with good food in a beautiful hotel. First impressiosn were good although thats where it stopped. The hotel is quite new and there has been a lot of thought put into the architecture of the place but not the comfort or practicality. And everything seems to have been done on the cheap and is already looking tired and worn. The shower was OK although not having a door or curtain meant that water went everywhere. The bath was tiled very roughly and although we didn't use it to bathe in, looked vary uncomfortable although it was good for washing our sandals!

 July 2015,5,A peaceful and relaxing stay,"I travelled to Essaouira with a friend to indulge in a relaxing break after a hectic year of teaching. We had been recommended this quaint town by several friends who had been seduced by its eclectic, sleepy charms and acting on one of their suggestions opted to stay in the Sofitel Mogador Golf and Spa resort. Arriving from our transfer from Essaouira Airport (a 15 minute drive) we were impressed by the luxurious, polished style that is the signature of Sofitel. Interior designer Didier Gomez, who has worked with the likes of Yves Saint-Laurent, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, drew his inspiration from the location, combining rich Atlantic-blue tiles with spice-infused furnishings and traditional Moroccan detail like mashrabiya windows. The results, the hotel blends…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2015,4,Unbelievable hotel in the middle of nowhere,"From the moment you enter the lobby, you enter into another dimension. It's almost as if it doesn't belong in Essaouira. The staff is extremely professional and there are luxurious touches and refinements everywhere you look. The rooms are spectacular, and the views from the balcony even more. Overall it is without a doubt a 5-star property, the only reason I am giving it 4 is because the food options are not on par with the level of the hotel, the buffet is expensive for what it is, and the onsite fine dining restaurant's price/quality ratio is disappointing to say the least. You can get much better food in Essaouira for less money. But otherwise, the hotel is fantastic.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

The hotel is spacious inside and its outside premises are immensely vast. The hotel has character and a beautiful garden adjacent to the hotel's golf course. Staff are always friends, helpful, polite, attentive and warm, in particular Az El from the lobby bar who would served us drinks in the evenings, Naima who would brought us fresh pastries in the morning and Abdulatif from the lobby who poured tea to new arrivals.

The staff are all helpful and try there best at all times, this was our experience through out the week. I was impressed that I had not been able to book in for the first nights stay via my travel agent , but on contacting the hotel they had realised the problem and it had organised a room for my first night, for which I am very grateful.

Room is good proportion but just those small details are frustrating; one cupboard door won't close because the mini bar fridge is in the way so the cupboard light is always on, several times they cleaned the room but not our terrace outside the bedroom. Breakfast was always excellent, lunch at L'Atlantique also really good but the main restaurant for dinner was always disappointing. The gourmet restaurant definitely slipped in quality of food although the service was excellent. This is still very good value for money and generally staff were willing polite & helpful but it lacked detail here & there that made it miss higher rating",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Good things about the hotel- so quiet! I think this is due to being slightly out of season. Hourly mini bus to town, about 15 mins. Stunning room. Free wifi. Lovely food. Attentive staff. Pools great. To be honest, you would have to be very picky, and really have to look, for anything wrong with the hotel. Breakfast outside on the sun, surrounded by sparrows and lovely food! We stayed a week and we are quite active, so did lots of things. There's not much going on in the hotel itself, which is fine as you can use it as a recluse.

The rooms are really good and kept spotllessly clean, with maids coming in more than one a day. The grounds are huge and go on forever - a walk around the golf course might use up a good part of any stay. The beach is a 20-25 min walk but is lovely and when you get there its mainly deserted.

This overly ambitious project has not quite worked, it doesn’t deliver the 5* Sofitel experience, nor does it capture the magic of Essaouira. Under occupancy is a problem, the long empty corridors could be a set for a post apocalypse disaster movie and meeting a fellow guest during the day is so rare that you say “Bonjour” to each other.

In spite of requesting the 3rd towel I get two towels.On one occasion they did not even bother bringing the towel. The staff are pleasant and the bus to town are good.

 May 2015,5,Most friendly and polite staff you could wish to meet,"First time in Morocco for us, so we weren't sure what to expect. Just a 15 min bus ride from Essarioura airport to the hotel - great. We found the greeting upon arrival exceptionally friendly. Our room overlooked the fabulous gardens and golf course, with the Atlantic ocean behind - really nice. We were surprised by the size of the room and especially the size of the bed - it was enormous. The room was very clean and everything worked. The staff in general were extremely polite, friendly and efficient. A special mention goes to Noorh in the Kasbah restaurant and Rasheed (who ran the pool bar) as exceptional members of staff. We would definitely go back. Only down side for us was the windy conditions for three days but the hotel could do nothing about that!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2015,4,"Good holiday ....not 5 star service, facilities excellent.","We have just returned, I share the views of all the previous comments but I must say that we had a lovely relaxing time. We had a garden room overlooking the golf course. Having the room serviced was very 'hit and miss'. Some days we had complimentary water and clean towels and other days we didn't . Service was the same...sometimes very good other times really poor. Rachid (waiter around the pool area) is excellent as was Norch in the Karbesh dining. We tried to book a taxi to take us out to a vineyard (with the reception in the evening we sorted out a price) but got charge for an excursion on our bill. If you want to go anywhere take the hotel bus into Mogador and get a blue taxi to wherever you want to visit, it will be 75 percent cheaper than the hotel.

 May 2015,2,Possibly a 5* Hotel sadly managed with 3* mentality.,"Like a lot of people I had taken the time to read the reviews on Trip Advisor before booking and travelling to the 5* Sofitel hotel. If anyone takes a few minutes to read back some of the older reviews you will see the same comments that I am about to make over and over, worse yet you will see the same replies from the hotel management thanking people for the constructive criticism and hopes that the customer will give the hotel a second chances on their visit to Essaouira.Sadly it appears that for all of the good (and as I later found out) very constructive criticism, the lovely words from management seem to be just lip service....as nothing appears to be changing.

 May 2015,4,Beautiful Hotel But Badly Managed,We are currently on our 6th night of a 7 night stay and I am ready to leave now. The hotel is beautifully designed and blends in with the natural environment in a very clever way. The view across the golf course and out to the sea is wonderful and at night you can hear the wild Atlantic Ocean and the birds. It's very tranquil. Our room is lovely and whilst it does look a bit tired in some ways I think it's meant to. Polished concrete tends to go that way. The views would cost three or four times as much in other countries. Check-in - It took ages and we certainly were not offered hot towels or a drink after a 3 hour journey from Marrakech. Reception seemed in chaos. Beds - it's lovely sitting in bed looking out to sea.

All got food poisoning from restaurant so ate out. Spa treatments mixed up. And they have a donkey in the kids club which is matted underweight and lonely as hell. The leisure manager informed me the hotel won't buy the food so he has to buy it from his own wages. Really!!!! Lastly on check out the overcharged by nearly double!

The design and layout are good, but the decor in the corridors and our room is tired, with lots of cracks in floors etc. The hotel is clean however. Food is generally of good quality, but we've yet to have a table that is fully set. E.g. This morning there was only 1 napkin and 1 teaspoon on a table for 2. Much of the above is bearable, but what has really disappointed us is the response to our 2 complaints. The hotel's website clearly states that there is an iron in every room. We didn't bring one for that reason. No problem we thought, we'll just ask for one to be brought to the room.

Check in:efficient with hot towels, tea and macaroons proffered. The amount that the hotel wanted to charge our pre paid currency card for extras was a bit high at £67 a night, so we declined and opted to pay as we required a service. A major negative for us was that the hotel 'opts out' of Mastercard's currency conversion protocol and uses an alternative provider,adding a 3% service charge, for us this amounted to an extra £40 charge on the hotel bill.

It was half board and our room was a very short walk to the restaurant, where a fabulous buffet for both breakfast and dinner was served. The staff where so helpful and nothing was too much trouble.. the outdoor pool was 30 seconds from our room with day beds galour to relax on.

Whilst the food in the restaurants was excellent, varied and substantial, we found the service to be on the slow side.

We asked to speak to the duty manager - who never appeared. We were told that the hotel was full and that our room was not ready - it was clear that they then put us in a different room to that originally intended.

The staff throughout the hotel, the grounds and amenities were second to none. The standard of care and attention was extremely high. The food served and presented was excellent and it was a welcome treat to experience a predominance of typical foods of the country and culture. We stayed in a room on the ground floor which was both quiet and had good views. Maybe not as good as ones above but able to walk out onto our terrace and onto a grassy lawn.

Liked the polished concrete as well. We were on the second floor and had good views out over the natural (green) pool and golf course. We also had some friends staying in one of the villas which was stunning, and although there are lots of rooms/suites/villas the whole place never felt crowded.

Trouble begins when seeking to use amenities, such as shower heads that don't work (even after 2 staff visits to the room) as well as outdoor pools that appear to be unheated and challenging to use even in warm weather.

The food was excellent and the choices amazing. Food had both a French and Moroccan influence which was ideal for our taste . There was a complimentary mini bus into town which we used on several occasions and through enjoyed walking round the World Heritage Site which was virtually hassle free and very interesting.

Its off season and we shopped around for a good, last minute offer and have not been disappointed. Hotel has a real modern contemporary feel with some quality beds, rooms and facilities but the staff and friendliness around the hotel has made it an experience to remember. I traveled as a single Dad with two young children (4 & 7) and I feel we have really been made a fuss of.

They do regular shuttle service so we didn't feel we were away from it all. Infact it was nice to be a little bit out of the way. The hotel boasts a really good golf course, apparently designed by a known professional (we don't play so didn't take advantage). A nice walk through the gardens/golf course takes you to an amazing beech! It's really big and you can walk to Essaouira old town from it, we didn't do the walk, but a couple we met did and it's doable at about an hour or so.

This does not detract from how nice the hotel is. It's location gives great views of the sea over the golf course, and the 10 minute shuttle to the local town is excellent.

Staff were all very friendly and helpful and the hourly shuttle into Essaouira made it easy to nip into the medina for a spot of shopping. My only criticism is that for a 5 star hotel, you'd expect there to be tea and coffee making facilities in the room. We also found it difficult for the bar staff to split a bill between the two rooms we had amongst our party, it felt like, because we were sitting together, all our drinks went onto one bill.

The hotel is very good, the staff and the management are well trained, attentive and good as in most Sofitel's. The villas are equally good and have enough outside space for a family and a reasonable sized heated pool. The restaurants are fairly expensive and the drinks are to. A bottle of beer will cost £4.50 and a bottle of wine is £20 - £25.

No problems there; we had fine weather almost all the time. The hotel is located a few miles south of Essaouira, and the shuttle bus was very useful for transfers and a taxi ride would only set you back some 4 Euros. The staff at the hotel were friendly and courteous at all times. Our room was on the 1st floor and like all others, overlooked the golf course. The walk to the beach through the golf course took about 20 minutes. A walk along the beach to Essaouira town took about an hour and a half. Tip!

Outside of that there is little to do on site. The hotel is on three levels. All rooms face the pool or golf course, with the higher rooms having a view of the Atlantic Ocean in the distance. A transfer was available to me as part of my package and the driver was waiting for me in the arrivals hall of Marrakech airport as I exited customs however he was not easy to locate. He was smartly dressed and very polite and courteous and offered to carry my bags. The car was new. Brahim drove safely and within the speed limit at all times and this is rare in Morocco.

So well designed, great interior, lobby really makes you smile, interior living plant wall, huge tree pillars etc, lots of fantastic features,chairs etc. Rooms maybe a little over complicated, but bed was sumptuous and bathroom quite open plan, but all very decadent, with huge verandas and views over the pool (at least he one I was in). Staff very attentive and friendly. A little hard to find hotel at night, could be better signposted, as its 10 minutes outside Essaouira, but quiet because of that.

We booked a 'Secret Escape' which turned out to be through Fleetway Travel who did a great job of co-ordinating the flights, private transfers (Mercedes and very pleasant drivers each way) and our beautiful room. The bedroom was huge (although the most standard in size) and very comfortable. Loved the bed - I'm not the best sleeper in hotel beds but this was the best ever, and huge. Everything is provided, including hair conditioner, robes and slippers so I could have saved some space in my case.

The highlight was sitting on our sofa on the balcony, watching the sunset, but equally lovely was the outdoor pool with its incredibly comfortable seating, and the amazing breakfasts (I've never seen so much choice in my life!).

It's a very beautiful, modern hotel and the food is great. The rooms are very nice, modern, clean, with an open shower and separate bathtub, (ours had a view of the ocean and pools) but, a bit on the smaller side. We did have our two kids with us, so it's quite adequate for a couple. The bed was extremely comfortable. The grounds are gorgeous and serene. There are a lot of different places to lounge around inside and outside.

 May 2014,4,"Great, relaxing, luxourious place","Stayed here for 3 nights in May 2014. Our room was modern, clean and had a great view of the sea - which was nice for watching the sunset in the evening. We flew to Marrakech and got the bus to Essaouria (not an experience i'm too keen to repeat), i've read on here that the hotel provides a free car service from Marrakech airport to the hotel but when we enquired we were quoted a price around €130 (from memory!). I do believe they only offer this service on longer stays (from what I have read elsewhere). It may be of interest that easyJet are starting a direct flight in the Summer 2015 from Luton (I think) so getting there will be much easier! The hotel is a taxi ride from the centre of Essaouria and there is a shuttle bus service from just outside the town walls to the…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 January 2015,4,Calming your soul,"After spending 5 nights in a freezing cold riad that we were renting for 3 weeks, we decided to spent 3 nights in the Sofitel to warm up. After 2 nights here, we extended an other 3 nights....and might extend again. People who complain about the Sofitel, do that on a high level, for no reason. Beds, rooms are very nice. I never had a shower with such a great view! Sunbeds at the pool are the best I ever had. Staff are trying their best. Food is delicious. Only thing that is missing for me is a coffeemachine in bedroom. This is Marokko and it has its own magic, some people are not able to see. Complainers, please go somewhere else...;-))))) thank you to everybody working here!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 November 2014,5,Simply Amazing,"Unfortunately there aren't enough characters available for me to sufficiently praise the experience gifted to me and my partner by this hotels' grounds, staff and ethereal aura. Simply amazing. I most deliberately took the names of the Front of House manager NICOLAS AMESTOY and Receptionist ERRAJI BEMIMOUN for their exceptional first impression as we arrived at the hotel in the evening, whose kindness and warming approach extended throughout the whole of our trip. I can only hope this review helps cement their future with Sofitel and that they continue to take great pride in the role. The hotel itself is absolutely stunning in every detail, unique in every way; my favorite part being the foyer wall of green plants (a 20ft wall with greenery actually embedded into the wall,…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

This year, also in december we stayed again in the same hotel and it was totally different : buffetrestaurant was closed, so we had to eat in an other restaurant, no buffet this time but we had only a poor choise of meals,f.e. the same soup the whole week, service was extremely slow and the temperature in the restaurant was really cold.Only the last day the temperature was normal, after several complains... Everywhere in the hotel the temperature was also freezing... Anyway, staff was very friendly and golfcourse was amazing !",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 December 2014,5,Amazing place,"The comfort of beds and bedding was fantastic. The staff were all so helpful and eager to please. The location was great, and the shuttle bus to town was excellent service. We walked one day along the beach ... Just under 2 hours from hotel, across the golf course and to the medina. The food was unbelievably good. We thought we would go into Essaouira to eat a couple of nights, there was no need as food was outstanding and lots of choice so we never bored. We ate in the Atlantic restaurant (3 courses as part of 1/2 board), ate one night in the gastro restaurant, and two nights in the So Lounge where there were events. One was a Moroccan evening, and the other a salss. Both fantastic.

 December 2014,4,"If you don't golf, than ?","My son and I spent two days at the Sofitell Essaouira Golf and Hotel Spa. We're fairly active and like to do a variety of things. The golf course is first class and is challenging but not unbeatable. We especially enjoyed the rolling greens and the wide fairways. If your coming to the hotel to golf, you will have a great time here. If you want to lay back and enjoy the beach and swimming pool than your okay. Outside of that, there really isn't much to do here. Essaouira has a nice market place that you can spend time in. Much like the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, it may take half a day to go through. In terms of the hotel, it's first class. The criticism that the place is run down is uncalled for. I have traveled a great deal and stayed at a lot of five star hotels. This is at…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 November 2014,4,French chic with Moroccan exuberance,"Though it's a twenty minute walk to the windswept beaches (across a golf course and a deserted road), you'll feel the salty gusts all the way inland here. Perfect on a hot day as you're reclining around the pool, bearable on cooler autumn days, as long as you've got a wrap with you. Winter? Hmmmm... I'm not so sure. Plan to spend more time in the jewel-bright hammam. The beach itself is dramatic to extremes - in one way, it's perfect - nobody but you, a couple of fishermen, the kind camel drover, and maybe another intrepid tourist or two. Wide sands, egrets, sandpipers and gulls. In other ways, it's a grim example of what we are doing to our poor planet.

If you are a golfer, it is a lovely place to visit, as the Gary Player designed course is great to play, although not cheap compared with some of the discounts available on courses around England. We met some very nice couples from England, some who had come for the golf, others to relax around the pool and enjoy the spa. The food is lovely, a rich fusion of French and Moroccan food, although at times we wished that was a salad bar. There is not much in the way of entertainment in the hotel, although there is a cocktail bar and a night club with a very good singer one night, which was virtually empty.

We had room 145 on the ground floor with a large terrace, daybed, lawn and trees. A short step to the pool and restaurants. Something had gone wrong with the floor of our room and the shower flooded out under the door, until we learnt to stand in the corner and use the wand, always plenty of hot water though and fresh towels every day. Very comfortable robes also. The food was rather bland, especially the tagines which we make ourselves at home with a good helping of Ras el Hanout.

On arrival we had mint tea and macaroons which was a lovely welcome. The room was absolutely great, the bed being the most comfortable I have ever stayed in- touches such as the turn down service and complimentary water were great. Our towels were changed every time we used them! The shuttle to the medina was really convenient and made a change from sitting by the pool, as did the walk to the beach which was a stark but good contrast to the hotel and grounds. The food at the hotel was diverse and there was always plenty of it. We took advantage of the Spa and Hamman which were very relaxing and planned for a cloudy afternoon.

We were picked up at Marrakech by a comfortable 7 seater, really friendly driver. The transfer is long but during the day it was fine and we stopped on the way for water and toilets. When you arrive at the hotel it is the wow factor, lovely reception with efficient check in. Mint tea and cakes. Our rooms overlooked a splendid golf course and the ocean.

The golf course is beautiful but they were relaxed about our beginner status, the spa luxurious too. But the real treat was renting a villa of our own. This meant we could come and go to the main pool but could also retreat to relax and just lark around in our own pool . The staff were generally very helpful, especially Erraji and the front desk team who were excellent and accommodated a string of little requests . Thank you .

The main restaurant for breakfast is also very good but for buffet style dinner was quite disappointing.

Our room was probably one of the best rooms we have ever had, not necessarily the biggest, but because how practical, comfortable and overall thoughtfulness when designed. We stayed at the Suite Mogador, it had a living area, two toilets, plenty of storage and outlets, a big terrace and a beautiful shower and hot tub. The first night the A/C was not working properly in the room (we were sweating) but that was quickly resolved when the following day a manager ""approached"" me at the lobby asking me if everything was ok and if I was enjoying our stay...that was great!

 October 2014,2,Needs some TLC,"This hotel is in need of some Tender, Loving, Care. While in a lovely location and managed by the Sofitel group, the owners are not paying attention to the condition of the hotel...which despite being new....is fading badly. Orange fabric on the public chairs is spotted and frayed. The wooden floors around the pool and in the bar area are peeling and in need of some sanding and re-staining. Some of the wooden slats are loose. Nicks and pieces of cement broken off due to suitcases hitting corners have not been repaired. Our room had cracks in the cement floor. And our shower head didn't stop dripping. Walking from the hotel to the ocean took us through areas that needed a good cleanup.

We stayed in a villa which had the potential to be stunning as long as you didn't look too closely. Cream sun beds and sofa were really badly marked and the decking was very faded with paint peeling. Simple throws would make it look more appealing. You do get an allocated Butler though. Hakima couldn't do enough for us when she was there and was a pleasure (she even tried to source a teapot I was looking for but couldn't find). Service in Morrocco generally we found a bit lacking. People are very nice but in the hotel restaurants you had to ask several times for things. E.g. Breakfast tables weren't laid ready (if they'd been used) - they laid them whilst you waited, various items were forgotten about and it took 2 or 3 times…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

The jewel in its crown is the pool - it is truly stunning and at the time of year we visited (mid October) was also very quiet. A wonderful place to relax and read a book and the pool service was also good (although sometimes a little slow). The room was very stylish, the bed incredibly comfortable, and we liked the outdoor furniture on our private terrace. I was disappointed by the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room however, as its something I would expect as standard from a hotel of this stature. The beach is a pleasant 15 minute stroll across the golf course. It's quite a wild beach, but very beautiful and there are sun loungers available.

 October 2014,5,Wonderful relaxing holiday,We have just spent our second holiday in the marvellous Sofitel hotel and Spa. We arrived at Marrakech airport to be met by the hotel arranged transfer. The journey to Essaouria took about 2 hours. The welcome by reception was brilliant and they could not do enough for us during the 10 days we stayed there. Especially Amyal who was charming as always. There were some changes from last year which were a little disappointing but did not affect the overall stay. The free mini bar is now chargeable and the turn down service was a bit hit and miss. The hotel is lovely with beautiful rooms with balconies and open plan bathrooms.

The actual hotel is lovely with lots of interesting pieces of furniture and design, the bedrooms are cool in their decor, the breakfast and evening buffet choices are good, the pool area is comfortable and relaxing. I would have liked more choice and to include local foods on the pool menu. Unfortunately we had ants in out bedroom, we reported it a few times but they returned.

The drinks are not cheap around the hotel but you expect that. The breakfast had plenty of choice with hot and cold food. There is an evening buffet which again had a lot of choice but pricey. There are some decent restaurants in the Medina for half the price. It takes 20 mins.. Through the golf course .. To the beach which is unspoilt and vast.

The staff is friendly and they seem to do their best. Check-in went well, the butler took us to our villa (906) and showed us around, the villa is beautiful overall. Cons: - There was some mold on the bottom of some walls, the cloth on the poolside couches and chairs were stained, there were no terrace chairs unfortunately.

Not enough hangers in the rooms, no hairdryer, not enough glasses to dring from, very poor communication between staff when we asked for things for our room and at best needed to make 2 additional phone calls , and personally go to the reception to ensure that they had received our messages. Eventually got our hangers,hairdryer, ice, but alas the air con is not working efficiently so that will now have to be resolved. when hopefully asap, but lets see so now have had to open the doors for some air.Should it really have to be so difficult in this day and age.... no it should not:((((( room 65 and 55.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

You can do this and it is a nice change from the sandy beaches around Essaouira. We enjoyed our day as the swimming pool is very relaxing as well as the beds you can use. The bar served some good cocktails and drinks and we had a good meal at the restaurant near the pool. Definitely recommended for a day off the beach and a bit of luxury. Take into account that the free shuttle from Essaouira stops going back to the city at 18:00. Also, enjoying the pool should be free - they want people from outside the hotel to spend money so don't let anyone tell you to pay up 25€ as we've heard...

Rashid and team at the pool side work hard to meet customer needs. Interesting, friendly and varied experience.

I have stayed at the Sofitel Marrakech which is superb and this definitely does not compare. If you speak fluent French you will be treated like your important but us mere mortals with pigeon French do not stand a chance. We had an incident with one member of staff and when I asked to speak to the manager three of them turned up like safety in numbers but I was the one feeling vulnerable! The food was good if you got there early but did run out quickly. There were issues with cutlery and dishes running out.

We had asked through our holiday company and directly to the hotel by email (when we'd booked a car for a trip) whether we could have a top floor room and were told that we could. We were disappointed to be then shown to a ground floor room (there were 3 floors) I don't like hearing people walking around above me. I was too tired to ask for another room that night.

The pool areas are luxurious and the spa was an extra treat to visit - All perfect for some R&R However I would agree with previous comments about the service based on the hotel being a of such a high caliber.

 August 2014,2,Could be better (SO much better!),"The SOfitel Mogador is located in a beautiful surrounding with golf course, beach, swimming pools (one heated & one natural), a couple or so of restaurants; a SOspa, a SOnight club as you wouldn't expect there; a SObar; a children villa (day care nursery for kids from 4 to 13 years old); etc. It also has two-bedroom villas with their own heated swimming pool overlooking the golf & the beach. This hotel gives choice without the feeling of being in a typical resort. Hotel Service – very bad, or to be more precise, they could do SO much better. There is a total absence of management who seems to blame its failures on its staffs and hotel success (i.e. the place is overbooked) rather than take the bull by the horns. Here, management has a new meaning… We arrived at the hotel…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Though the services are far below expectation for a 5 star hotel! Some examples: - Food at the Pool Bar is of poor quality. Our club sandwich and French fries were served cold, the bread was burned. After sending it back, the fries were cold again! The waiter of the pool bar was annoyed that we complaint….. Very bad quality for absurd prices! - The first day the shower and water tap were not working. We had a technician in our room for over half an hour to fix our shower and the water tap...

 September 2013,5,Amazing facilities and great location for the beach,We stayed here for a week late last year and loved the set up. The main hotel is beautifully laid out (we stayed in one of their villas which was also beautiful) and all of the facilities are what you would expect from the Sofitel. Good food and great service. They run a shuttle bus down to the town and the beach is a 10 minute walk across the golf course,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 August 2014,5,Comparison of Essaouira and Agadir Golf Courses,"Overall, if you are picking a location based on the golf course, it’s going to depend on the style of course you want. If you want a serious course and a tough challenge, Essaouria / Sofitel is the clear choice. It’s also prettier, with ocean views, and much better maintained. If you want an easy round on a pretty course, Golf du Soleil in Agadir is a great choice. Either is going to run US$160-200. If you are used to 5-6 hour rounds back at home, you’ll LOVE the fast play times here! Read on for more details. Please hit ""helpful"" if appropriate"" Essaouria / Sofitel The course is at the luxury Sofitel Hotel. It’s a 15 minute cab ride south from the Medina, or 100 dirham (about US$12).

 July 2014,3,Don't forget to bring Mr & Mrs Patience in your bagage,"We booked Sofitel through an agent which had a reasonable half board package including flight. Although I did not mind the travelling from Marrakech Airport to Essaouira - 2 1/2 hours (with a break half way), I found out it surprising that we have had to wait for over 2 hours for a room. We reached the hotel around 12.30pm but had to wait until 3pm for the room. I found out later that this doesn't happen only on our day. I'm surprise that neither the hotel nor the agent could agree that on early arrivals, they should allow check in earlier rather than waiting the usual standard time of 2pm. The restaurants at the hotel are ok. Menu for dinner are the same every night - I was expecting a bit more variations.

 July 2014,3,Small things that would make a big difference.,"The Sofitel has got it all there for the taking. Wow factor when you arrive, beautiful grounds, modern well decorated rooms. There are some stand out staff in the restaurant and by the pool but I have to agree that reception staff and the general organisation at the hotel is poor. We were also sat down and left at reception for about 20 mins after the initial wow factor not great. We were finally sent to our room. It looked good. That night at 7pm the sprinklers started. Our room backed onto the golf course. The sprinklers came on for half an hour and completely drenched our terrace and outdoor sofa and it's woollen cushions, this obviously rendered it totally unusable and we were robbed of a chance to sit and chill on our terrace after dinner.

 July 2014,3,Disappointing - five star? Not really,"The service at the hotel is pretty dire - things just don't get done especially housekeeping: the water is not drinkable so it is important to have a bottle for each bed delivered with the turndown service - most nights we had to call several times and wait for at least an hour for anyone from housekeeping to arrive - not ideal with kids wanting to go to bed. The rooms are generally comfortable (we had a villa with a private pool). The buffet supper is just about ok (but not really 5 star), breakfast is good, but the restaurant gets busy most of the time and the seating arrangements are not ideal. The food from the pool bar is terrible and should be avoided. The main pool area is good but gets very busy (with people putting towels down before breakfast).

 July 2014,4,Nice place to stay but a little isolated,"We have just spent a week here. We walked into Essaouira most days along the beach, about 4 miles, and then got the hotel shuttle back. We last got there by camel. At night you are effectively stuck in the hotel unless you use a taxi. We made good use of the gym which was quite small but quite we ell equipped; it could have been better air conditioned. The food was good. Buffet style, although it started to get a little repetitive. Fish, chicken, meat and noodles cooked to order. There are 2 main restaurants. We were told the food in each was identical but we were not convinced it was. We were told on several nights that the larger restaurant on the left as you stand in reception and look towards the pool was full so we are in the one on the right.

 August 2014,1,Didn't live up to expectations,"Service at reception isn't great- we were not welcomed with tea although others in our position were and we had to wait an extra hour past the confirmed check in time to get the keys to our rooms. When asking at reception to check in, they told us to take a seat and although they were not busy, we waited half an hour and we were still not attended to. The first room we were given was not clean, there was sand and handprints on the porch and the shower was covered with limescale. After a long and tedious couple of hours, we were able to change our room, however, as a family, our children were not able to stay in a room next to us.

My first impression was what an UGLY building, looked more like a prison no charm just concrete. There was a problem with our booking so we had to wait 2 hours before we got acceptable rooms. First evening the main restaurant had no tables for the 4 of us so we had to eat in the less favouried restaurant. My daughters room(214 I think) was damp, the shower water did not drain. We had to make several requests, eventually in writing before she was moved. The food was good, lots of choice and the staff were very attentive but not always got things done quickly.

 July 2014,2,Modern Block in Morocco,Having travelled through Morocco for ten days staying in some fantastic hotels we arrived at Sofitel expecting a beautiful furnished and character filled hotel. It is not ! It is a modern block 25 mins walk from the beach and 15 mins drive from the town. We stayed in a villa which could have been just about anywhere with its own pool. Quite a relief as it seems to be the sort of place people reserve their sun beds around the communal pool before 7am with a towel and a book and then disappear for hours. The food although good in quality was on a perpetual Buffet basis. Wearing after 3 meals a day . Definite feeling of the package tour about it.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

The room was impressive, we were in a superior room and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was late when we arrived so went straight to bed. In the morning we noticed a few minor glitches with the room, very poor reception on the TV, the do not disturb sign didn't work and there was a serious lack of tea and coffee facilities in the room!

They do lots of activities. For babies you can get a baby-sit. The staff is very friendly and helpful. But one person in special deserves our special thanks for the more than exceptional care she gave us: Hakima, our butller. She is a very friendly women, and above all very efficient.

Large terrace and comfortably furnished meant it was easy to hang out there a bit on the one ""average"" day of weather we got. Otherwise, we lounged by the pool and relaxed on the comfy poolside lounges. But it was the people working there who really make this place. From the guys at poolside to the restaurant/bar staff, right down to the ladies who serviced our room each day. They were all fantastic to deal with.

It really is quite spectacular. It is a contemporary style, but with lovely Moroccan touches, such as enormous lanterns in the foyer. We were welcomed with mint tea, raspberry macaroons and Moroccan pastries in the foyer and sat on large felt 'pebbles' by the living wall (a floor to ceiling wall of plants). Our room was beautiful and the beds were without doubt the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, in the world.

Overall this is a beautiful modern hotel with luxury amenities and luxury prices. The view from our room and large terrace was really spectacular and the bed was the most comfortable we ever slept in. The two pool areas are very nice as well to laze the day away.

We particularly fond of the photographer and also the man serving tea in reception. Most of the staff spoke good English. Location: This hotel is situated a few km outside Essaouira near a village called Diabat. The hotel run a complimentary bus into town on the hour and back on the half hour. It is about a 25 minute walk to the beach across the golf course and you can walk along the beach to town in about an hour an a half though I would suggest bus into town and walk back along the beach.

Contemporary decor by Didier Gomez and contemporary grounds. Easy shuttle bus in to Essaouira, takes 10 mins and available on the hour.

A weekly newsletter is put in the rooms...many activities are free including pilates and Moroccan cookery demonstration/ classes for tagines & pastries.

The only justification for the isolated location of this hotel is that it sits on a golf course; and what a bizarre location for a golf course! I don't play, but I imagine that it would be easier to achieve a low score using a snooker cue rather than clubs, as the fierce winds did not abate once during our week's stay. The uninspiring exterior looks out over beautifully kept grounds, and two large, stunning swimming pools, the quieter of which gives on to a pretty, natural water feature. Our upgraded room was well designed, comfortable and kept clean. It had the same view from the balcony facing the distant shore.

Our trip was hellish from the outset as we were picked up from the airport by a taxi driver, arranged by Sofitel, who gave us filthy looks for taking 30 mins to get through passport control and then drove at up to 160kph in 60kph areas.

However, throughout our 8 day stay, only the cafe kasbah buffet at 35eur per person was open for dinner. The food quality is mediocre at best and drinks are not included (meaning that you have to pay for bottled water too!). The entrees remained the same every night and were comprised of stale mussel salad, disgustingly old smoked trout and bland salmon and very doubtful deli meats.

So we sat down at the table to have a look into the winelist. The waitress came and of course we could get a free glas of wine for our voucher.

Decor of the hotel is outstanding as are the rooms. Our sole criticism is there were a few room maintenance issues which could be easily remedied if a regular snagging took place.

From the minute we were greeted at the door and reception to our departure we were overawed with the quality of service and the friendliness of the staff. One evening we were in The Medina when two of the hotel staff recognised us and asked if we were OK or needed any assistance. Where else in the world does that happen?

The location of the hotel is perfect, a short taxi ride from the old town on a lovely stretch of beach and surrounded by the lovely golf course.

 May 2014,3,"Some good, some disappointing...",We spent three days in this resort hotel. The location is great if you like golf and are not looking to be in the Medina. The hotel is 10 mns from the city center by free bus shuttle running on the hour. A pretty nice breakfast is served in two areas. Prefer the biggest one which has a wider choice of food. The three pools are nice. There is free WiFi throughout the resort. Where the hotel falls short in on the rooms which are average. The shower is tricky to figure out. Some of the decoration (the floor in some area) seem pretty old. This is not consistent with the luxury image of the Sofitel chain.The staff was uneven as well.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2014,4,Close to perfection,"A wonderful hotel with superb, accommodating and friendly staff.

Thank you for such a great stay Samia & Alexis",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2014,2,Such a shame...,"Stayed with my wife and two kids. The hotel may look 5 star but the service is woefully short of that standard. With the exception of a few members of staff everything is an 'effort' and consequently really lets the hotel down. Equally the quality and variety of food in my opinion also isn't 5 star standard. In short, its a 4 star property but with 3 star service!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2014,4,"Beautiful hotel, terrific food, lovely staff. Some drawbacks.","We stayed for five nights. The hotel is about ten minutes by car outside of the village of Essaouira and is beautifully designed with lovely use of blue tiling and European and Moroccan influences. It is set back from the beach (a 25 minute walk across the golf course) and blends in nicely with the coastline. The hotel itself is nicely laid out around one of the principal outdoor swimming pools (which is heated). The poolside is perfect for lounging around on nice sun beds, and the pool great for kids messing about as well as for doing lengths. There is another great pool which is natural (bio, not chlorinated and also not heated) which is a little fresh in April and hence quieter. The rooms in the hotel are very nice from a visual perspective with terrific balconies, and…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2014,3,Modern- ok,"We stayed for 3 nights before heading down to Marrakech. We used the hotel transfer to collect us from Marrakech airport which was very efficient. We arrived early but the front desk were very quick in trying to get a room ready for us despite it being 10am and check out isn't until noon. That was greatly appreciated as we had been up since 2am. The rooms are very spacious and modern decor. The floor is the only thing that let's it down as it looks a bit a tatty. The restaurants in the hotel are very expensive and to be honest not worth it when you compare the price and quality you get in the town. Gym is small, has the basics. Would expect more from a Sofitel gym but perhaps they don't have the clientele to use it hence why it's minimal. The courtesy shuttle is great, the 7pm…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2014,4,"Excellent rooms , great views across golf course to sea","The hotel has a very modern design and has been well thought through. The pool area is central and has great views across the golf course and woods to the sea. The rooms are very cool. Large tub stone baths , dressing area, rainfall shower , large comfy beds and good size balcony - really top quality. We had interconnecting rooms with children and these were available on our arrival at around 1 pm. The only real criticism of the hotel is the breakfast is a bit chaotic - the food quality is good but the service is haphazard - not what you would expect of top class hotel. The free shuttle bus into town is great - don't be put off by some reviews complaining about the distance from town - it takes less than 10 mins. Some excellent restaurants - in particular would recommend the…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2014,5,Lovely hotel in laid back Essaouira,"After the madness of Marrakech, Essaouira was a revelation with its sweeping beaches and laid back atmosphere. The Sofitel got us off to a lovely relaxing start after our long drive with a welcoming mint tea and raspberry macaroon. The two bedroom pool villa was fantastic and a great place to relax and enjoy the incredibly good (non windy) weather. Great gardens, communal pools and open spaces and lots for children to do. The absolute highlight was a camel ride across the sand dunes and the beach organised through the hotel at the nearby ranch with reassuring guide Hassan.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Marrocan bath is nice accent and atmosphere. Very nice lightning concept in and outside everywhere. Beautiful view from every room. We had room 168. view ocean en nice garden ( interesting when you bring kids along) Choice of materials is beautiful, but after 3 years you see already problems: for example floor doesn't bear water, lavabo has black spots.

Breakfast not as varied as agadir sofitel Some people look abit annoyed that children are here.. So overall good outweighs the bad by far If I was in essaouria again would stay here Tip: personally I think agadir souk el ahad obviously is the best and biggest market by far to shop with very good prices. Then marrakech souk I would 2nd And last essaouria although it is much less hectic than marrakech and to me a mix of agadir and marrakech.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2014,3,"Beautiful Hotel, Poor Service","We stayed for three nights in March in the Sofitel Essaouira and it really is a beautiful hotel. Very lovely and scenic. The best part for us was the room - decorated to an outstanding standard with a wonderful blue tiled bath. The balcony was a perfect sun trap as it was very windy when we stayed so perfect to sunbathe on your own private balcony. TV and Bose sound dock were nice touches too. The rest of the hotel was great, but the restaurants were slightly hectic. The prices are much higher than you would expect to get in Essaouira in the Medina but the food is excellent. The prices in the bar are also astronomical. However for breakfast the restaurant was a disaster area. Lots of staff walking around but not cleaning tables or helping people. It was hectic and utter…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2013,5,Great Hotel!,"We stayed 4 nights in this upscale hotel. It was a great time as we took benefit of all: good location (even far from the town - a free shuttle is provided), huge beautiful gardened open spaces, lovely swiming pools, tasty chef food experiences and relaxing room-with-a-view (even the modern futuristic decorations are not my favorite). Highly recommended.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 February 2014,5,Fantastic resort,Lovely hotel and staff. A mix up with our booking with Alpharooms was smoothed out. A problem with the room was sorted by the guest relations manager who reassigned us to a much better room. She even sent us a note and chocolates to say sorry for the room not being ready when we arrived. Staff were great with the kids and were always smiling and helpful. Have stayed at the Sofitels in Marrakesh and Agadir and while those were good the staff were slightly arrogant. No such problems here. Grounds were immaculate - kids enjoyed the golf and swimming in the clean large pool. We will definitely be back soon. They just get the concept of unassuming luxury. A credit to the chain.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 February 2014,5,Perfection for your R & R break!,"We stayed on a girlie 5 night break in this georgous hotel, which we booked thro our favourite holiday company VoyagePrive. Sofitel hotels are as good as it gets and I have stayed in several across the globe. We were pampered and looked after by the usual attentive and professional staff from reception to the excellent restaurants. The breakfast is super and the fish restaurant is simply divine. We loved the location as it is set in the hills in the countryside but the Sofitel offers an hourly shuttle into town. The room was fabulous with the 5* trimmings one expects - the beds are akin to sleeping on a cloud of marshmellow!! The only comment we offer is that the hotel supplies daily newspapers in Arabic, French but not English! Otherwise expect perfection!!We would definitely…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Beautiful location and surroundings, from the moment you enter the lobby you are immediately transported into an oasis of pure bliss with mint tea flowing and an atmosphere of calm. Not necessarily the best place to stay if you are looking to explore the town, it will be hard to tear yourself away from the place.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 December 2013,4,Beautiful resort but poor service let it down.,"Went for a family Christmas, with husband, 6 year old and grandmother. We booked a Mogador villa with views of the golf course. First impressions were very good and both rooms were of equal size with en-suites so there were no arguments as to who went where. Villa was well equipped and beautifully furnished – the beds were incredibly comfortable and bonus having an expresso machine at hand. Our pool area was lovely but the pool was not heated (as described) so impossible to swim. Christmas Eve they held a reception for all families, where Santa arrived on a camel to hand out presents to each child. It was a great event and an opportunity for my daughter to meet other children.

Even from perspective of our view -being spoilt in this context more than once-. So summarize: GREAT and authentic hospitality around the clock, relaxing spa treatments & golfing, nice arrangements for Christmas & new years eve and enjoyable food and drinks.

Our experience was exceptional throughout- from our room to the spa and dining. The staff were very professional, passionate & attentive to our needs. They worked so incredibly hard to provide a great experience. The food in all of the restaurants was top quality and 'Des Aromes' a la carte restaurant is Michelin star quality, in our view. We honestly experienced the best service & luxury in this hotel out of all of the10 hotels we stayed in right across Morocco.

It was a very organised journey and the driver was lovely. The hotel lobby was impressive and our first thoughts were that the service was fantastic as well as a beautiful location. We wanted a relaxed secluded break for this leg of our trip and this is exactly what we got. The trip was celebrating our anniversary and the staff, especially Hasna was fantastic in arranging a lovely meal for us. The view from our room was breathtaking and the entire hotel grounds were peaceful and pretty. We had an ocean view room with a lovely balcony.

Tucked away outside the beach city of Essaouira, this hotel, nicely landscaped amid greens, palms, consists of stand-alone villas as well as rooms. The ones on the ground floor with sliding doors opening to the greens are the best. Contemporary design, comfy beds nicely decorated. The Xmas buffet was the best buffet we had for a long time. Actually the breakfasts as well as dinner during the other days were superb as well. Apart from wonderful food and a wide, spacious and attractive swimming pool area with lounge chairs and a small terrace, the hotel offers a great holiday place.

We have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world and we would rate the customer service at this hotel as exceptional. Particulary thanks to waiter Murad, and butlers Gibriel and Hakima for making our stay so pleasant. We were given an lovely cake and a complimentary meal in the a la carte restaurant. We had a few snags in the villa which were rectificed when we reported them and an issue on checking out when we were being charged for half board for which we had already paid - again this was sorted out but it would be wise for future visitors to keep a copy of your voucher to evidence what has been prepaid.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Buffet brekkie was great - I see from other reviews on here people complaining of bird in the restaurant - they clearly have resolved this as three people patrol all day with eagles or whatever they are! They only downside is the drinks are outrageously expensive... £10 for a glass of local wine and £5 for a bottle of beer. We took duty free gin! The mini bar with soft drinks is free tho everyday.

Although: The pleasure of staying here is significantly reduced by massive shortcomings in the service - especially in the restaurants. If you get here expect drinking your coffee without milk - despite you prefer it with some - since you will never get it! The service rarely works, is always too slow and not always friendly. Combined with really high prices and a SPA that doesn't offer everything a SPA should have (e.g. a Sauna) this would not be my strongest recommendation.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

At our arrival, as soon as we got to our room, we asked to have it changed to a higher floor. We were left with ‘let me check, I’ll get back to you’. After 30 minutes of no news, we decided to unpack and to go to the pool. After an hour or so (around 18:00) we got back to the room and found a letter inviting us to another room on a higher floor. Being too late, and having already unpacked, we went to the front desk to say thanks, but now it is too late.

The villa was kept clean and serviced twice a day. Put the card provided onto the bed if you don't want clean bedding every day.The grounds were tended daily as was the pool.

Stayed for one night at a Riad in Essaouria which was to small for us so we moved to the Sofitel for four nights.

We were showed to our room, however there was a slight maintenance problem, on reporting this to reception we were allowed to use the room whilst we freshened up and while they made up another room for us, which was an upgraded room due to the problem we incurred. The staff dealt with the problem so promptly and courteously. All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. I have stayed in five star establishments all over the world and must say the staff at the Sofitel Essaouira were as good if not better than some five star hotels I've stayed in the centre of London. As expressed by others, the food was truly amazing in the restaurants (apart…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 January 2013,4,Beautiful grounds and the sea......,"This very well located Sofitel boasting traditional Moroccan architecture throughout specially in the rooms. Had a great breakfast buffet and for dinner we enjoyed a variety of locally produced cheeses, some of which were better than their french version.The grounds and pools and the vast property had the coast as limit and the view from my room was astounding.The room itself looked Moroccan but the open shower has problems since some water spilled out since there was no level change between its basin and the floor of the room itself.The staff was friendly and helpful.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2013,5,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service","The hotel was beautiful - definitely worth a trip! The transfers to and from the hotel to the airport were smooth. Upon arrival, we received a welcome drink and local pastries. The room was beautiful with a balcony from which you could see the sunset. The staff is extremely friendly in the hotel as well as in the Spa. The breakfast is amazing. Dinner choices are varied although slightly pricey. The rooms are kept clean and bed linen and towels are changed every day (towels even twice a day). Personally, I believe once a day is more than sufficient and the hotel should adopt the same position as other hotels on towel change to reduce the environmental impact (i.e. towels on the floor = change; towels on the hook = re-use). The grounds are vast and very well maintained. It is a…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2013,4,Superb Villas,"My wife and I stayed there last week in one of the villa's. I have to say that they were very nice and the private pool was superb and really nice in the morning since it was always heated. The buffet restaurant was ok, but quality of food was better upstairs in the a la carte restaurant (but was a lot more expensive). The shuttle service into Essaouira was very useful and regular service meant that you could stay as long or as short as you wanted. The beach was about a 20 minute walk and nice and quiet as well. There was an issue with our bill which took longer than anticipated to resolve but was done so in the end.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

On the return transfer the driver was kind enough to stop off without being asked to, and buy us cold water which was very kind. The Hotel - When we arrived, the receptionist came to us to check us in which was a nice touch, but even before this, there was a man in traditional garb playing a lute who stopped playing and presented us with a refreshing mint tea and a macaroon! Check in was quick and easy, and our bags taken from us and brought to the room, which I'll come on to. The hotel itself was lovely, it was very modern with touches of Moroccan detail.

 September 2013,5,Great relaxing atmosphere,"We recently went on a family holiday here and it was amazing. The staff were always happy to help and were incredibly smiley and friendly making you feel very welcome. Tea on arrival in the lobby, a Nesspresso machine and free drinks in the minibar went that little bit extra. Both pools are beautiful and have slightly different atmospheres. The restaurants were all delicious, with a lot of choice to go round. The prices were quite high but to be expected with a 5* resort- this is true for the spa too. The gym was well equipped but noone used it when I was there- so I had it to myself.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2013,5,So much more than we expected!,"My husband and I booked a 3 night stay here after a 5 day atlas/Sahara trek. It was just wonderful. The staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating. The room/pools and all other areas of the hotel are decorated beautifully. Breakfast includes everything you could imagine. We ate at the buffet 1 night which was an experience as there was everything there and we ate like kings. The inlet issue we had with our room was the shower was not working to perky. When I notified reception, they sent a maintanence man down inmmediatly who fixed the problem. The hotel is a oasis of tranquility and is a suitable destination for couples and families alike. We would definitely return.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 August 2013,4,Relaxing,"Friendly staff with good care to guests.

Enjoy the golf.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 September 2013,4,Very nice hotel but only used for sleeping and pool!,"We booked the Sofitel as we got an amazing deal through Expedia. Having stayed in a Riad in Marrakech it was a total flip to be in a 5* hotel one night later. The staff at the hotel are lovely, always smiling and saying hello and i cant credit them enough! We ended up mainly using it as a rest after Marrakech staying by the pool in the morning, then using the free shuttle bus (VERY useful) into Essaouira for lunch and dinner. We had breakfast one morning which though was very nice we objected to paying £20 a head for (we weren't on a tiny budget but not used to 5* prices i guess). Rooms were very nice, free mini bar drinks was a nice touch and all in all defiantly a good experience.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

It lacks some privacy between the bedroom and the bathroom, but not a big deal ! Breakfast : better to go before 9h30 ! Pancakes, fresh fruits, eggs, soups, cheese, meat… name it and you will have it ! Bread is excellent, couldn’t stop eating it ! Pool : it was heated (staff told us at 28 °C) and very pleasant. There is a 2nd “natural pool”, less people around it, but not heated… Staff : the best part of the stay ! Everybody, from the GM to the room maid, has been exceptionally friendly and polite.

The lobby is spectacular, the rooms are spacious, nice balcony with magnificent golf & sea views. The restaurants of the hotel provide good food at a reasonable price, and the service is extremely friendly. I've read other reviews *, and feel very bad about what have been said.

 August 2013,4,Great hotel let down by poor service,"The hotel facilities are great, the hotel feels new and the Villa we stayed in was excellent and worth the extra money. Its out of town (but the shuttle bus is hourly and reliable). We booked half board which I would recommend as the hotel is 5* expensive. Service was frustratingly poor with service either great or poor with plenty of pleasant staff failing to deliver small things they promised. A little organisation and training seems to be all that is needed. I wouldn't let this put you off though, the facilities really are great and you can enjoy the experience and just accept that the service is not yet 5* never mind luxury. The hammam and spa were excellent",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 August 2013,2,Very disappointing maintenance & service,"While the hotel location, architecture and decoration are outstanding, it is very unfortunate to discover a very poor service and maintenance. Just to list few of the issues we experienced during these 5 days : - wrong booking for number of nights, had to be corrected - room was not ready by 2:30 pm on arrival date - dirth can be found in corridors connecting rooms - walked on broken tiny glass pieces in toilet - issues with hot/cold water in shower - no evening housekeeping and no regular minibar filling (had to call for refill) - no towels in pool and when available in pitty conditions - no bicycles available despite having tried for 5 days - door access to spa from main building was broken, however got repaired same day - lack of personel in general in main restaurant…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

It is a beautiful hotel with excellent rooms but with a management and service very bad. It certainly desprestigiante to have in chain Sofitel a hotel with a level of service so mediocre. Examples: - On the day we arrived at 17h our room was not ready and when we ask why, the recepcionist just simply said we had to wait an hour because the hotel was full and without further explanation turned back and left us talking alone. - When we had the room the bed sheets were full of brown spots and a balcony full of dust - The corridor to our room in three days was never cleaned - The next day we asked what was needed to be able to ride a bike, they told us that it was enough to make a reservation in the reception, we did so at 14h to…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Particular praise must go to the Spa staff who carried out the most divine treatments with extreme professionalism, considering it was Ramadan and they were working whilst fasting.

Worse still they told me I must leave immediately. I went to my room to confirm - they had disabled my key. On returning to get it enabled I was again told to leave immediately. Both these occurred in front of many other people. My sick wife was drinking tea on the terrace and left that(this was never refunded).

The outdoor terrace was lovely and very spacious. The only complaint was the bathroom with lack of shower enclosure which left the bathroom a swampland in minutes. The international buffet was very good with plenty of choice. The only complaint in this regard was that I had warned the hotel that I was severly dairy, gluten, and egg intolerant and requested they obtain gluten free bread etc..which despite further requests while we were there never was fulfilled.

Don't get me wrong, they welcomed us with tea and many gentlemen to bring our luggage. But I found their ""speech"" to be very ceremonial and unnatural. We went for dinner at their gastronomic restaurant. Again, food was great, but service ... our waitress was not very smiley and looked a bit snob.

A couple of problems, small but could be important. First the birds flying round the main dining room particularly at breakfast time. They fed from the cereal bowls and pecked at the bread/pastries delivered to the tables. A huge hygiene issue. Also, we were told that the hotel was only two years old and it looked a little tired in places. On the plus side the staff were largely very charming although it is a big help if you can speak French. Our main complaint was with the Spa and this is a big warning to other package trip people.

In our second week the hotel was more booked and unfortunately the service quality decreased substantially: There were waiting times during breakfast for nearly everything and during dinner time the main restaurant was very full.

When it was eventually ready, we arrived to find that they had not set up the extra bed that we had book for our son. We were assured this would be done 'immediately', yet 2 hours later we had to again contact the staff to request it was done so he could go to bed. Having since read other peoples reviews it is apparent that this seems to happen quite frequently. Another gripe was that the only option for kids meals was 7.30pm-9pm. I am aware that this is a cultural thing, however in an international hotel with that number of restaurants we were astounded that the only way we could feed our son before 7.30pm was to order room service.…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

Pool areas are pleasant, staff friendly, superb views over pool,golf course,and distant sea and dunes. Free onsite bike use, golf course looks magic (didn't play)and a decent cycle/walk round. Restaurants are little limited, on 1 night we had a choice of one (buffet), but went to the other which is pricey, on other evening.Used free shuttle bus, which is easy and reliable, as walking into town is too far(2 miles), and ate at the golf club twice for lunch which is very good.

Our first overall impression of the hotel was positive, but like some reviewers already mentioned the hotel choice of decor is a little questionable. Their extreme choice of achieving the modern look, I think, works against the practicality and the functionality of the room, esp. in the shower where there is no curtain or door to block the water from splashing everywhere in the bathroom. I had to use all the towels to lay on the floor so I wouldn't slip and fall after getting out of the shower....as I actually did slip several times, but luckily didn't fall.

The decor in this hotel is an interesting mix of contemporary colours and wonderful pieces of furniture made from old olive wood and luxurious fittings. The view from our room, across the gardens to the sea was spectatcular. We had no need to draw the curtains so could watch the stars at night. The bed was one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in. Breakfast - the range, presentation and quality were all excellent.

So, nearly 4 hours later we got there. We experienced silent passenger rage when the driver slowed down repeatedly to about 5 m.p.h on a totally empty road because the speed sign said 40 k.p.h..

There are three restaurants but at this time of year there are generally only two open at any one time in the evening. The L'Ateliers aux Aromes for dinner was the best. The adjacent 18 hole golf course was a pleasure to play on. The beach is about a thirty minute walk away through the golf course or bikes are available to use.

We had dinner in the hotel on the first night as this was included in the deal. It was very good and the staff welcomed us and told us where everything was. The dinner cost 350DM PP (12.5dm to the £) which I would say was about right for the quality of the hotel. Gin and tonic £8.

 March 2013,5,SERVICE,"Absolutely Spectacular ! A great location on the offbeat track. With a staff that will not accept any shortcomings from themselves. This resort has everything you'll ever need.

A must for the traveler who wants a little bit more.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2013,4,Spring Holiday,We recently stayed at this hotel on a 10 day break. We were on a b&b basis and the breakfasts were excellent with a full range of buffet and cooked breakfasts. The hotel was comfortable although the bedroom paid more attention to style than substance. The service was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and courteous. The only complaint is that the hotel is 10-15 minutes drive from the town and because of the absence of street lighting and pavements it is not really walkable unlike the Sofitel at Agadir which was a pleasant 30/40 minute walk from the town and restaurants.,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2013,4,An enjoyable stay,"We spent 4 days at the Sofitel Essaouira golf and spa having had 3 days in Marrakech. We arrived to a warm welcome with mint tea and macaroons being offered whilst we checked in at leisure. The staff in the reception were helpful and informative. Our room was not luxurious but very pleasant with a balcony overlooking the pool, golf course and in the distance, the sea. What you need to be aware of is that this hotel is not on the beach. We were told it was a 20 minute walk or a 10 minute cycle to the beach. We opted for the cycle option, which was marred by broken bicycles and it took us about 45 minutes to reach the beach. There was no map provided and we followed brief instructions from the staff. We meandered around the golf course but at least we got plenty of exercise. Once…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 December 2012,3,Nolonger a 5 star property,"Not what you expect from a Sofitel property. The hotel is falling apart. As a 5 star property you expect them to pay attention to the little things. The door handle to the shower was missing, paint is peeling and corners of tables, etc are chipped or cracked. As much as the staff are friendly the service from all departments is slow. Meals and drinks are expensive which I would not have an issue with if the food was good but it is below average food. If you like to walk to and from town the hotel is located a little far but they do offer a shuttle and a taxi is not that expensive. I would not have an issue staying here again as the property is nice overall when you look past the little details and do not expect 5 star service.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2013,3,Just not good enough,"This hotel has all the potential to be a very good five star hotel, however it fails in some basic things. Though staff is very friendly, there is a total lack in the organisation of personnel. Even the most simple things seem to be very hard to be accomplished. I find it unacceptable to have to wait more then 15 minutes (almost daily) to get a drink, whilst few other people were in the bar. Prices for drinks are exceptionally high. Though the hotel claims to offer free Wifi, there is only Wifi in the lobby and the bar, not in the room, neither at the pool. The general cleanliness of the rooms is really disappointing. See pictures attached. The hotel is deteriorating: paint is peeling off, light fixtures were rusted, ... The golf court is recommendable.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

The Asian , Moroccan style of the hotel and the bed room are so peaceful We had lunch at the pool side thanks to the weather , and at the golf bar , quick and cheap and the service is really great For the diner we had the buffet and all the choice was nice The swimming pool is really wonderful hot and big Few kids during the school holidays but not noisy We had the chance to attend the classic car trophee arrival and departure and the show was wonderful Take some time to go and have lunch to the fish market , with lobster and shrimps with wonderful local people Great experience",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2012,3,Very expensive for what is worth,"I stayed here in June 2012 because it was too hot to stay in Marrakech, and didn't booked anything else in advance. We wanted something with AC, and after looking at two small places around, we decided to go to Sofitel. We got a nice big room with views on the pool, with Breakfast included, but it was not worth the money, very expensive for the service, really not worth it unless you want to show off in a 5 star hotel! I will not go back, I tried twice after two Riads and they are worth the value!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2013,1,"Nice rooms,uselesss service","Arrived in Essaouira today for one night. Staying at the Sofitel. When you arrive it looks great, asian style, open, clean lines. Room is very good (a villa) but, and it is a big but, service is appalling. I arrived at 6 pm, no hot water in the room (sorry sir, we are full!!). It is now 11.45 pm and one of my suitcases is still somewhere but not with me. Also, when I left for dinner to Chez Sam (great place, by theway) I asked for the duvet on the bed to be changed for a sheet and blanket. I spent a good 3-5 minutes explaining what I meant (English is not good to say the least). I arrived back at 10.45 to find the bed with a blanket but no sheet. It is now 11.45 and finally, the bed is being made. Amazing lack of service for a Sofitel of this category.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

I had been there once before, couldn't wait to return and my decision was justified completely. I have been in the hospitality business for 51 years and I must congratulate everyone at the Sofitel Mogador for every area of the hotel being exceptionally outstanding. I am a golfer and the golf course is superb, the greens every day must have been running about 11 on the stimp meter, took quite a lot of getting used to, with a lovely breeze making it more testing.

The furniture was very nice also. The pool area is spectacular and having dinner there is quite an experience. In the morning you can see the ocean. The garden is also lovely with plenty of places where you can just snooze all day in the sun. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that my key wasn't working and it took a bit of time to get someone to fix this problem. Also, being a chain hotel, it's very large and there's quite a lot of walking along twisting and turning corridors.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

One half, the beautiful views, the outstanding gardens, the amazing spa, the fantastic golf and even the free shuttle in and out of the Medina. The other half, service is not great at the weekends when the staff are running around at breakfast and totally forgot our table, the fact that the sofa in the room is converted to provide the extra bed for our 4 year old leaving us with nowhere to sit other than the bed, we asked on three separate occasions for another sofa or chair and nothing was found, extra charges for using the swimming pool at the spa even when the main pools heating system is broken and a ropey internet connection.

Management are totally foccussed on providing first class customer service and they succeed in all areas, the staff, paraphrasing Tina Turner, are “simply the best”. Rooms are luxurious and provide all that is required including a Bose Wavelength sound system. The outdoor pool is heated and poolside is a perfect serene place to relax, staff are unobtrusive but are available immediately should anything be required.

The people at the hotel were genuine and very friendly and even though they struggled to understand my accent some time it never caused us any problems and we found everyone very helpful. The only down side was the food poising I suffered , though the hotel helped me with a constant supply of water and even getting some medication for me from the village . This is also where we noticed how everyone really did try and help from suggesting chamomile tea to just asking how I was and if I was feeling better, so unfortunately we did not get to test all the different food options but what we did have…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

It will still take some years for this hotel to be at its best but being a demanding traveller I enjoyed the stay. The food is expensive but realy excellent. The Spa is not exceptional but the service and settings are ok. The golf still needs some years but is already enjoyable. The rooms are realy great, great view, terras. The only minus is the staff at the swimming pool. They have to combine service to guests for beachtowels and sunbeds and food. This combination does not work. If you order some food it takes them ages to first of all get you a menu. Count over 30 minutes before you will get food or drinks.

For now, it was a lot of staff with a lot of smiles welcoming their guests. The main reception area is located at a level higher than the poolside and the restaurant.

Sofitel Mogador is also very nicely taking care of their smaller guests, with kids menus and a full time staffed activity centre (Kids Villa). Our stay was very smooth with only minor hiccups due to language. WiFi is easy to connect to but the signal strength was flaky in the room and in some public areas.

Essaouira is about two hours drive from Marrakech and according to the guide books no motorized traffic is allowed in the old medina. Well, the guide books were wrong! The situation is not as bad as Marrakech but there were mopeds all over the place. We started to eat outside at a charming Mexican (yes, Mexican) restaurant deep in the medina and four noisy mopeds pulled up right next to us revving their engines so much that we had to take up our food and go inside.

After commenting on the latter, the rude director aggressively told us that "" if we weren't satisfied, we could go back to where we came from"". In addition, the food was disappointed, the hotel was very under-staffed because of the national holidays, and the WI FI was often not functional. The hotel also charged our credit card BEFORE we had even arrived and checked in, althought it is precisely stated on the reservation website booking.com, that it is not until the client has arrived to the hotel that they shall be charged for they stay.

Senior management techniques are very evident, so why 4 stars not 5? A few small things: Our room wasn't quite ready when we arrived, no big deal, we were given a nice glass of mint tea and some fruit in the lobby.

And there are lots of small things that are not done properly. For example, my shower door didn't have an inside handle, so it was impossible to pull it to shut properly (water all over the floor).

To get your drinks cold or your meal hot at the table well just forget it. When complaining about this at the director he simply told us that a lot of the staff were trainees ?

The one meal (breakfast) that I ate made me sick and upon check out the concierge double charged me for my already overpriced airport transfer. I would not recommend this hotel.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 August 2012,5,A para dise called Sofitel Essaouira Mogador...,"Staying at Sofitel Mogador I enjoyned the must pleasant holidays in my life. Very attentive staff always looking to meet or even exceed your expectations. Very present management assuring always the good operations of the Hotel. Regarding the hotel, simply amazing!!

 March 2012,5,5* all the way. Excellent modern service with an edge of traditional Moroccan welcome combined,"After Marrakech i needed to stay in a cool, sunny area: Essaouira. The hotel is new and quite hard to find but when you arrive it is magnificient. The lobby is huge and gives views to the sea, as do ALL the rooms. You are greeted with mint tea and moroccan savouries, which is a nice touch. Valet are immediately there to pick up luggage and i felt very cared for, not to mention at ease and welcome. The golf is beautiful and the hotel staff are very family friendly and helpful. Very pleased and i passed a relaxing 4 days of luxury thanks to the Sofitel.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 February 2012,4,"good hotel, great settings","good hotel, by the beach, secluded pool in the middle of the hotel, sheltered from the coastal breeze ! very nice rooms, with balconies, good spa as well. The pool isn't heated, so if you want that, don't go too early in the year.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2012,4,A Great Place,"I have just come back from a week at the Sofitel Essaouira Mogador Gold & SPA with my wife and son (6 years old). The hotel is very well designed and fits nicely in the environment, it does not feel like a big holiday resort at all. The design and interior decoration is modern but with a definite morrocan twist which makes it very special. The rooms are very spacious with everything you would expect from a sofitel. The staff is very friendly and professional, there is never a problem and always a solution (even if sometimes the solution does take some time to materialise..). The director (Daniel Karbownik) is there every day and has a kind word with all the guest at the bar or at dinner. The food is really good, breakfast is fantastic, and a special word for the ""aterlier aux…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2012,5,A breath of fresh air!!,After 5 nights in Marrakech with 45+ temperatures it was delightful to arrive at the sofitel and feel the breeze. This is a wonderful hotel in a beautiful setting with the golf course and the ocean. Facilities and service were as you would expect from a hotel of this class with only minor exceptions (reception were very slow and took ages to deal with even the most simple of questions). The pool area was great with a variety of ways to enjoy the sun. Our favorite was the raised platform with the billowing curtains that we spent ages arranging and rearranging to give us shade from the as we needed it. The boys at the pool kept us fed and watered ( the menu was quite limited). They even gave us dry towels as we came out of the pool as our damp ones would apparently make us too…,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2012,5,A beautiful hotel in a stunning location,"We have just returned from 5 nights at the Sofitel. It far surpassed our expectations. As we were staying for 5 nights they arranged for a complimentary transfer to and from Marrakech - this was well organised and very prompt. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with Mint Tea and some delicious pastries. Check in was very efficient and we were given a good introduction to the hotel, the facilities, the restaurants etc. Our room was beautiful, with amazing views over the swimming pool and ocean. The room was well equipped and as you would expect from a hotel of this standard, it was kept clean throughout our stay. As mentioned in some previous reviews the floor in the bathroom area is starting to look a little worn in places. Throughout our stay we found the staff were very…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2012,5,Brilliant service.,"We recently stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in July and it was a great experience. The staff are extremely attentive. The hotel organised a complimentary taxi from Marrakech as we were staying for 5 nights. The hotel itself is really well decorated and very modern. The pool is beautiful, the perfect setting and the staff around the pool were particularly good-very friendly and always on hand with new towels and service for drinks or snacks. The only thing is that there really is an incredibly strong wind and this makes sitting in some areas around the pool a little difficult. There were some areas which were a little bit more sheltered though. The room- really well finished, very modern, lots of space. We had a beautiful view over the pool and out to the ocean. The…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 July 2012,5,"Lovely resort, great for families.","We recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We arrived at midnight after a 16 hour drive from the desert and arriving at the Sofitel was like arriving in an oasis. It is a gorgeous resort, and is run very efficiently. Staff are warm and friendly, breakfast is delicious, the pool is also lovely although it can be a bit chilly when there are strong winds. I highly recommend playing golf, even if you just hit the driving range, as the golf pros are extremely friendly. It is perfect for a family stay as the kids villa is absolutely brilliant and they have a lot of activities catered towards children. The only downside I would say is the distance from the main city, but the shuttle bus service that they offer runs every hour and drops of you in front of the old city. The food by…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2012,5,Wonderful experience,"We enjoyed 7 nights at the Sofitel from the 9th June. The holiday was to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. We booked a Prestige Suite but upon arrival we were presented with a Mogador Suite which was a wonderful gesture. The suite was on the 1st floor with fantastic views of the gardens, pool, golf course and the sea (in the distance). The room was tremendous, could not fault anything. The room service (food, drinks) was 1st class. The only sad thing, we could not use the spacious balcony due to the strong winds from the Atlantic.....Essaouira is known locally as the ""windy city"". We ate in the L'atelieres Aux Aromes twice. The 1st meal was superb....food, service, wines 10/10 but the 2nd visit was not so good, probably due to the the restaurant being full whereas…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 June 2012,5,Excellent customer service....,We stayed in this hotel for four days having spent three days in marrakech. We travelled 2 1/2 hrs from marrakech to Essaouira which is a complete contrast to the hustle and bustle of marrakech. The Hotel ha a minibus which run every hour into essaouira which is the centre with a working harbour and fish market plenty of little medina's and souks (markets and shops) in winding alleyways thoughout lots of bars to sit and people watch but no alcohol is served for religious reasons (you can drink in the hotel) The room in the hotel are very modern with private balcony with large furnishings on. Although there is a golf course we did not go for the golf but for the comfort of the hotel.

 June 2012,5,Fantastic; what a great experience!,"Our first time visit to Morocco Essaouiri and a Sofitel. We were blown away by the friendliness and warm of the people. The Hotel is an example of great design and good decorating. The hotel is surrounded by unspoiled nature. The rooms are big with all the amenities you can think of and the hospitality and service is great. Just some minor details of fine-tuning needing to be done. The management and staff have and open mind and ear and very responsive to any suggestion or concern. If there is a complaint it is solved quickly and smoothly. The pool area is proven to be a lot better organised as is stated in the previous comments. The food at the Les Ateliers d’ Aromes, service and atmosphere is great. If you have specific wishes in regards of the food the staff will do…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 May 2012,5,Great break in Essaouria at Sofitel Mogador,"We just spent a quick 48 hours at the Sofitel Mogador. We live in Marrakech and Essauoria makes a nice break now and again.

 May 2012,5,Special thanks to Majid for his impeccable attention and service!,"We've enjoyed a couple days in the Villa Mogador in a relaxing atmosphere with a beautifull view on the Atlantic. Even though it was very windy the kids enjoyed the heated swimming pool. Mounia and her crew were so friendly and helpful on every occasion reflected in all the services we experienced - bravo, tumbs up - keep up the good work. Hope to see you soon Majid!

 November 2011,4,Impressed...,We stayed there a few months ago and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Working in hotels myself i was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the products and the investment witnessed in every aspect of the hotel..this really changed my view on Sofitel generally speaking! Was truly fantastic...the service was ok and needs fine tuning but it still is a relatively new property and I am sure that with time and more experience it will become better and better. We will certainly return as soon as we can!,Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 April 2012,5,Attentive staff and wonderful view,"The staff here were unfailingly cheerful,pleasant and helpful adding greatly to the luxurious feel of the hotel.We were lucky enough to be given a room on the top floor with a huge balcony overlooking the grounds to the sea and where we spent a consierable amount of time relaxing.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 February 2012,3,"Could be Great, but let down by service","This hotel could be so good, but some of the service was so annoyingly inept that I couldn't recommend it. First the good bits: Location was good and the outlook was great. The constant breeze must be fabulous when the days get very hot. The rooms, pool areas and restaurant are great (in terms of how they look). The front of house staff are efficient and very pleasant as are some of the service staff notably those in the golf club. Now the bad bits: The prices are on a par with any 5* hotel that you would stay in, in any major city, so I will review it as such. Pool Service - This was just non existent. Despite there being 6 pool boys on duty and probably only 15 guests around the pool, trying to get a drink was impossible. You's have to ask at least 3 times for anyone to…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2012,5,Stunning setting masks teething problems with service,"Let me be clear - this is a stunning hotel and one of the most fabulously designed I have ever stayed in. It makes the Sofitel in Marrakech look like a garden shed. From the moment you walk in, you realise that Sofitel went the extra mile with this one. It does something very difficult, because it mixes European contemporary chic with local Moroccan colours and styles - and they have pulled it off spectacularly. Everything is eye-catching, from the 'living wallpaper' of greens in the foyer to the designs of the seats, lighting and rooms. The setting was superb. A few km away from the town, the Sofitel is in splendid isolation perched up the hillside giving the rooms superb views of the golf course and grounds, leading all the way down to the Atlantic ocean. The rooms are…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 March 2011,5,Roses roses in your room,Did I love this place or what? Me and my friends were treated to the most scrumptious dessert tray on arrival and the loveliest roses. This place just rocks! Bar and restaurant ...stellar. Went in March so too chilly yet for golf course or the pool. You can tell this location was just perfect and has that still very unspoiled feeling! But overall this place is magical and service impeccable! Oh yes the roses in the bath were outrageous...;},Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 February 2012,4,excellent hotel,"This is our third day at Sofitel Mogador in Essaouira. We really like it ! The hotel has perfect location with great views of the golf-course, the Atlantic Ocean (800m walk to an unspoilt beach with lovely dunes) and the city of Essaouira (3km to the old centre of town). The modern architecture works well, although the interior design might have been a touch more restrained in some of the colour-options. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and with stunning views from the balconies. Service is omnipresent and most friendly. I won't complain about the cuisine - I know I'm a demanding food & wine lover - but its the weakest part : a bit too oily, sometimes creamy and lacking some modern, fresh, acidity elements. I'm happy with the nice choice of Maroccon wines, though.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 January 2012,5,Perfect service and beautiful villa.,"We stayed as a family of 5 at a villa and from the booking to the transfer to the hotel everything was dealt with efficiency and warmth. The villa itself has a private butler service, automatic curtains, a fireplace and its own private pool. This is the best hotel I have stayed at yet and well worth paying extra for the villa- especially if you are a family! I did the booking through the reservations agent Hafid, whom I cannot commend more for his impeccable service!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 December 2011,5,A Perfect Place to Relax,"The rooms in this beautiful, ultramodern facility overlooking the ocean blow you away. Any amenity you can think of they have, from maginificant balconies overlooking the golf course and ocean to indirect lighing that washes the room in the gentlest light imaginable. We got the least expensive room and it was fabulous--the hotel is built such that all rooms have wonder vistas. Service was warm and friendly, with managers everywhere working hard to ensure that we had everything we needed. The hotel made several gaffs, eg putting us in room directly under one that was being noisily worked on, which they rectified immediately (and made up for it with a free dinner for 3 in their high end restaurant, which was spectacular). The food in both their middle and high-end restaurants was…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 November 2011,5,Quite possibly the most beautifully designed hotel in Morocco!,"This is a new hotel with contemporary design and decor that is just beautiful! Amazing furniture, both in the public spaces and in the rooms, two beautiful pools, a location that is incredible - it looks out on a beautiful expanse of green that is the golf course, and beyond that is nothing but the Atlantic Ocean - plus a fabulous spa, hammam, and gym. Just a few minutes from the port and medina, but apart from the noisy traffic and pollution that comes with it, this Sofitel gives the feeling of walking into a piece of sculpture. Both restaurants we ate in at the hotel offered excellent food - one was a fine dining restaurant, and the other a buffet restaurant. The hotel is a very good value for money, considering the level of service that is offered. Highly recommended!",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
 October 2011,5,"Great Place, great staff","The hotel is modern, the villa is great. The staff is very friendly. We only stayed one night, unfortunatelly. On this evening everybody was invited to a Manager Cocktail and we had a nice chat with the staff and other guest. Recommend it, like the other Sofitels in Marocco as well. They are expensive enough but not as expensive as in other parts of the world and the people there are very friendly. Normally I do not stay in Sofitels, because I think they are to expensive for what you get but not in Morocco. We were travelling with 3 kids, age 7, 11 and 14. The Sofitel beds are a little to soft for us, but ok.",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira

 August 2011,3,Nice for a week-end...,"Went there with our young children (3 and 5-yr old) and stayed in a villa with pool. Positives: - All-new hotel with modern design and facilities; - Staff was nice and helpful; - Villa was convenient and well-equipped. - Kids Club was remarkable: our kids loved it, especially ""Said"" and the girl in charge of the club who were so kind and thoughtful. Many activities with a different program every day, excellent! Negatives: - The wind! Not a surprise for Essaouira, but need to get used to it... - Food: below average despite the Chef's efforts: more diversity and simplicity would be more than welcomed... We were really disappointed having to eat the same appetizers (although in different shapes!), entrees and desserts for more than a week!!! Half-board is not worth it: be ready…",Sofitel_Essaouira_Mogador_Golf_Spa,Essaouira
