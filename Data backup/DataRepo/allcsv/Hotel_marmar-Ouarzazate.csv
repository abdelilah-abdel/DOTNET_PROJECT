The hotel is very clean and nice, beautiful rooms. Our room even had a balcony. Unfortunately we were only given a small portable heater which did not work properly, so the night was very cold! The room underneath ours had an airconditioner working all night which was really loud.

Handy for gettng to Ait Benhaddou, It's a good 5 minute walk to the local square, but the neighbourhood around the hotel is a quiet local one and pleasant to walk around. The hotel has a cafe on the ground floor, where you can have breakfast. Service was good and the breakfast was nice. The cafe did get a touch noisy one or two evenings as we stayed in a room on the floor above, but it certainly wasn't rowdy. The internal doors of the hotel do bang quite loudly so we could always here people coming and going. The room itself was very clean and the shower was top quality. Good…",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate

We were lucky that the hotel was quiet while we were there and most of the rooms empty; the echo inside the building amplifies all sound and the few other guests we encountered were the source of a lot of noise, not because they were being loud but because of the echo and the thin walls. It's a 20 minute walk to the centre, which is entirely manageable. We picked this place because of the free parking spot across the street; we rented a car during our stay, though not from the company associated with Marmar (they quoted us much higher prices for no reason - we decided on a smaller can rental agency, most are situated on the main street in the centre…",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 February 2016,5,Comfiest bed in Morocco,"First of all, the room is great: spacious and clean. The toilet and shower is an actual bathroom that's separated from the bedroom with a door to close. The bed is super comfy with the firmest pillows. We've been traveling in Morocco for about 5 weeks now and have stayed in hostels, riads, hotels, and airbnb's, and this is the best bed we've slept in. It was a bit cold at night, but there was already an extra blanket in the room that we used and it was fine. we nearly missed breakfast in the morning and the kindest gentleman ever offered to take breakfast up to our room to enjoy!

 December 2015,3,Good value for money,"We stayed for one night at 135 Dh each, which is a very convenient price for a hotel. Rooms are tidy with nice bathroom.

 November 2015,5,Good base for exploring Ouarzazate,"After my initial arrival in Marrakech and some time getting acclimated to the exciting country of Morocco, I realized that it was time for the obligatory visit to the desert and camel ride. I took a bus over the breathtaking High Atlas Mountains to Ouarzazate, and spent three days exploring the film industry there and in the historic walled ksar of Aït Ben Haddou (Lawerence of Arabia and Gladiator, for example). Hotel Marmar provided a very comfortable and place to stay, and a good base for my exploration. The location is excellent, just a few blocks from the Supratours Bus Office and the main taxi stand for both Grand and Petit Taxis. I also enjoyed grilled kabobs at locals joint of El Bahja (and made a cat very full and happy). Another night I feasted on Chevreau M’Kalli,…",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate

 July 2015,4,Excellent Budget Hotel,"I had an excellent stay at Hotel Marmar. My room was big and spotless; there was no AC so the room was quite hot. The man at the front desk was extremely helpful and went above and beyond his duties to help me out (he called the bus station to reserve me tickets, organized a half day tour to Ait Ben Haddou, provided information about Ouarzazate and was just generally helpful). I would definitely recommend Hotel Marmar.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 July 2015,4,Very nice hotel,"Hotel Marmar is a nice place to stay when visiting Ouarzazate. The staff is very kind and helpful. Our room was decent and clean, although the shower was slightly defective. The location is good, but kind of far from the city centre (Ouarzazate is pretty spread out). All in all we recommend this hotel!",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 July 2015,5,Very nice place to stay over night before going to desert,"We received good suggestions on how to go to desert.

 March 2015,4,Nice and easy place to stay,"Hotel Marmar was a nice and cheap place to stay after our desert tour and before returning to Marrakech.

The hotel is quite new and facilities are all in excellent condition, the shower hot and powerful, beds and bedding fresh and comfortable, rooms surprising large. The included breakfast is served in the cafe downstairs that belongs to the hotel, freshly squeezed orange juice, yogurt, cheese, jam, croissants or pain au chocolate, fresh bread and probably the best coffee I had in Morocco were an enjoyable treat. The cafe is busy with locals relaxing most of the day so you know it is good and very reasonably priced, I much prefer this than being in a tourist only environment.

Otherwise good - coffee for breakfast is wsy above moroccan normal standards.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 November 2014,5,A great place to stay,This is a handy spot if you're hoping to spend a bit of time checking out the city. Parking is adjacent to the hotel. Room was not enormous but had ensure and everything was spotless. Breakfast was basic but very adequate and it was not expensive to supplement the meal in any local restaurant. At the top of our experience was the friendliness of the staff and how accomodating they were. They were more than happy to speak English which was a big help given that we had one word of Berber which we slipped in as many times as possible when appropriate. (Spelt how it sounds-shookran which means thankyou). I reckon we'll be back in the Hotel Marmar.,Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 October 2014,4,Great value for money,"We stayed one night in the hotel while travelling around in Marocco at the end of October. The hotel is situated outside the city centre on the road to the airport. We did not mind as we were travelling with a car and therefore could do trips to the center any time. The room was clean and comfortable. The AC did not work, however. And the level of noise from the street was quite high at night when you needed to open the window to get some fresh air. Overall, it is a very decent hotel with a great price/value ratio. By the way, the breakfast was yummy :)",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 September 2014,3,You paid for a room to sleep (perfect for Supratour traveler),"We picked this hotel solely because it's within walking distance to the Supratour office in Ouarzazate. It's amazing how Ouarzazate differs from most other cities we visited in Morocco. It's extremely quiet and not nearly as populated. Getting a taxi here is not as easy as we thought! It's very affordable. At the same time, you get nothing more than a bed and a decent shower. (No AC if that matters to you). There is free wifi in the common area but the staff turned off the wifi before midnight when they went to bed. There are plenty other hotels much closer to the town centre and CTM bus station. I would not recommend someone to stay here unless you are travelling with Supratour and making a brief overnight stay in the city.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 July 2014,4,Decent hotel at a good price,"Hotel Marmar is an affordable place to stay if Ouarzazate is simply a stop off point for you. It is located close to the Supratours office and bus/taxi station and not far from the city centre. The room is adequate and a nice size with a clean, modern bathroom. Service was very friendly, mainly from the guy sitting at the front desk, who is always willing to help. Breakfast, like most places we stayed, is rather basic but will suffice. Overall it's a decent hotel that gets the job done.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 January 2014,4,Marmar,"The hostel is nice. Clean, close to bus station that drops you from Kesh or Merzouga, and close to city centre but not too much close. The breakfast is exellent. Rooms are big, clean and nice, with own bathroom. Guys who work there very friendly.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 May 2014,4,"Cheap, Clean and Lean","I'm rating this very good for the cheap price (165 durhames) and the fact the room was clean and did the job. There was no TV or AC so it was a bit noisy during the night with the window open. The price included breakfast which was coffee/tea, bread, cheese, fresh juice, croissant and a yogourt. The front desk was helpful - they helped me add credits to my Moroccan SIM card and pointed me in the right direction to get a grand taxi out of the town to other sights. It's a 10-15 min walk to the city centre.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate

I wish I remember the name of the Berber man working on the reception, who made a hand map of everything I wanted to see and haver some priceless tips for the next trip.

As it was quiet season we managed to negotiate a slightly better rate than advertised which was great. Our room was a decent size, with enuite bathroom. The shower was nice and hot and the hotel was spotlessly clean. Breakfast was included and was good with lovely espresso coffee, orange juice, yoghurt and lots of bread.

 June 2013,4,Good value,"Although not in the centre of town, hotel Marmar represented good value for money. Rooms were clean and simple, staff even bought a fan to ensure we were comfortable. We were greeted with Berbere whiskey (Moroccan tea) and Ali made us feel very welcome, he also provided us with a useful map and information about the town and surrounding areas. We would recommend a tour of the atlas studios for 50dh each and the atmosphere in the square at night was relaxed without the hassle of Marrakech. All in all a great stay!",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate

Sometimes you have to wait several minutes for hot water or ask reception to fix the problem. The wifi will only work on the ground floor and up to the 1st floor.

Besides an excellent location for travel, it has one of he warmest staff I have encountered on 4 trips to Morocco, which is saying alot as Morocco is known for warm, kind people. The hospitality is 5 star and most the staff speak some English and good French. The wonderful breakfast, which is included in low priced large rooms with large bathrooms, consists of delicious Moroccan bread, a large croisant with a touch of chocolate, yougurt, strawberry preserves, delicious coffee with foamed milk, fresh orange juice and 2 cheese wedges. They have couches in the lobby where you are made to feel…",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 February 2013,5,Clean and cheap,"Brand new hotel with clean rooms, maybe a bit essential, but you can't complain for what you pay! Very helpful staff: they helped us to organise days out from Ouarzazate, renting a car with driver. Even though it is located quite far from the town centre it is very close to Sopratours bus stop and grand taxi stop.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 March 2013,5,Really nice people and great breakfast!!,Hotel Marmar is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in during my trip in Morocco. It is great value. The staff is really friendley and the rooms are clean and spacious. There is free wifi access and the view from our room is great. The breakfast is amazing and the coffee is even better. And all of this for only 22 euro a night for a double room.,Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 November 2012,3,"Cold night, no hot shower","Room was small, poor but clean, just after restoration. There was no TV-set and closet. A large and tasty breakfest was included. Hotel had a power outage at night, so we had no light. There was also terrible cold in our room. The room wasn't equipped in heater and we had less then 10C outside. There was no hot water to take a shower and to warm up.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 October 2012,5,great clean hotel friendly host,"Very clean rooms, new bathrooms, great breakfest, wifi and host super helpful. I would recommend this hôtel to anyone, familiers or backpackers ans couples. Je recommande cet hôtel a tout le monde. Le proprio nous a trouve un taxi pour seulement 500 dirham pour aller a ait benhabou et ensuite a agdz. Vraiment bon deal",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 October 2012,3,Nice stay,"It's a clean and friendly hotel! Not new, toilettes may need a refresh but the staff is very helpfull and friendly. Well, they will always ask you to leave the key at the reception...if you have a trouble with that just for you to know! Not central but very close to the gare routiere. Breakfast simple but enough!",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 October 2012,5,Great location and staff,"We only stayed one night in Ouarzazate and just walked in to this hotel as it was the nearest one from the Bus Stop., We managed to get a room for 20 Euros with breakfast which was really cheap for this town, as online the cheapest fare I found was 35 Euros!. The reception guy really helped us with everything and to get a tax next day to see Kasbah Ait Benhaddou. This hotel is very modern (only 3 years old).Bathrooms are very new and nice and there is toilet paper (as many hotels we stayed in Morocco didn;t have one). Rooms are very clean and staff very nice. Breakfast was typical Moroccan - bread, butter, jam, coffee, tea and they even had cheese!. Also to walk to the main square it only takes 10 minutes. Good hotel for a good price.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 September 2012,4,Great value for the money,"The staff were great with everyone speaking English which was helpful. Hotel was clean with en-suite. Free wi-fi that was useable in the room (had a front room). Unfortunately due to no air conditioning or cross breeze, it was very hot in the room. Slept with the windows open but without much relief. The down side of an open window is a VERY noisy street.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 August 2012,5,Great value for price,"Hotel is clean, new and really you cant find better value for money around. If you can, choose rooms with no window on main street, since there is no aircondition in rooms,mand traffic could be noisy. But stil it is worth the price. Breakfast is also good value, so I recomend it.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 September 2011,5,Great Staff and Hotel,Great new hotel located 10 minutes outside of the main part of town. The owner Iddir is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and clean with an en-suite and WIFI is free.,Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 April 2012,5,Film city,"The hotel is easy to find and near the gare routiere. The personal is very friendly (they speak english). It is very cheap and clean and the building seems new. Breakfast is good and continental. This has nothing to do with the hotel itself, because we really liked the hotel. But we didn't like Ouarzazate, it's not much going on here.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 March 2012,4,Would stay there again,"We spent there just one night on our way to the desert but i have no complaints. Room was spacious, no problems with hot water, very friendly and helpfull staff, great breakfast, kept very clean. Would recommand it! Great value for money.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 March 2012,4,A warm welcome at a great price,"We received a warm welcome from Hassan and his team and he even came to meet us at the bus station to help with our bags.  The service was friendly and helpful and we were given a map of Ouarzazate and suggestions for places to visit. Our room and the ensuite bathroom were very clean, simply furnished and we had a lovely comfortable bed.  Breakfast was served at whatever time we wanted and we were also offered complementary tea and coffee on our last night when we returned from a long day sightseeing. This hotel provides excellent value for money and great hospitality. Only negative is that noise travels in the hotel although this didn't disturb us during the night - we slept well.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 December 2011,4,Almost brand new hotel - good accommodation and helpful staff.,"We found Hotel Marmer when we hired a car with Hassan. His brother runs the hotel and of course Hassan encouraged us to try it on our return to Ouarzazate. This is good budget accommodation. The rooms have been furnished with attention to detail and are clean and comfortable and everything is new. There is as yet no heating/a/c or TV. The only slight problem with Hotel Marmer is that it's a little bit away from the centre - and there are hardly any restaurants nearby. One 'cheapie' that we were directed to by the staff - was OK - average food, but very cheap. There is a cafe downstairs which just serves drinks. Breakfast is included in the room price and is very good. (Croissant, bread, jam, yogurt, juice and tea or coffee). Double en-suite room MAD 200 with breakfast.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 January 2011,5,unforgetable moments,"We were there a year ago but it's still in our memory. I didn't fill just like another client (like I use to fill in european hotels). Friendly, cheerful and helpful staff, willing to have a nice chat, with an open approach to their role as a hotel staff. Grate breakfast and atmosphere. Probably the rooms are even better now as at the time when we stayed there the hotel was brand new; they were really nice and comfortable; definitely everything you need. If you have a chance have a look at the view from rooftop. As far as I know you can sleep on the rooftop for a really god price. It's something that you are not ganna forget.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 November 2011,5,staff is wonderfull,"This hotel began our acquaintance with Morocco. The first of what should be said – staff !!!! Extremely attentive, interesting and friendly people work there, especially Hassan. The hotel is located near the center, along with station of Supratur (buses) and parking grand-taxi, that was convenient in our itinerary. The hotel is simple, but clean and comfortable. We really liked it.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 September 2011,5,Wonderfull place,"We stayed there for one night and it was great. Staff is so friendly, we spent long time talking and drinking mint tea with them. Rooms are great, clean and comfortable. Nice breakfast. They helped us with organizing the tour to Ait Benhaddou. If I will have a possibility I will surely come back to this hotel.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 September 2011,4,Great Value,"Stayed here for a night and had no issues. The staff is extremely friendly - Hasan even came along with us to show us the Kasbah and then showed us a great dinner place. When I realized I'd left my wallet back at the hotel he promptly took some money out of his pocket and insisted I take it. Good breakfast too! Rooms are not too bad. Nothing to write home about, but I guess you get what you pay for. All in all a definite yes for a budget traveler.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 October 2011,5,Excellent,"The hotel is brand new (about a year old), and the rooms (very clean, high-ceilinged, tiled, en-suite double rooms with comfy beds) are fantastic. What's more, they're wonderfully cheap (breakfast included), and the owner is very friendly and helpful. The hotel's 5-10 minutes' walk from the town centre. We had a balcony and there's also a flat roof to watch the sunset and admire the mountains from. Ouarzazate is mostly a modern town, but there is a fantastic Kasbah, and it's a calm, laid-back place where no one tried to sell me anything and the locals we met just wanted to help us. I recommend the Hotel Marmar and Ouarzazate as a perfect place to base yourself while exploring the south of Morocco.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 September 2010,5,Excelente sin duda el mejor de marruecos,Excellent after 20 years we found again the muslim hospitality. The owner and their workers are heirs of arabian tradition and a lovely friendship. We change the route to come back and surely if we return to ouarzazate we will come back again. Unfortunately the road is quite loud. To find it arriving from Marraqueix on the first roudabout (the movie place) turn left and straight on till you see the spot on the right.(ithe spot is not too visible),Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 January 2011,5,"Of all the places I've ben to, this deserves the most praise.","For a one star hotel it sure acts as a 5 star establishment. Sure, It doesn't have the facilites or the bling, but all-in-all it's just amazing. We were picked up at the bus stop, welcomed by a complimentary tea and quickly booked in. I only had to show my credit card - they didn't check it or anything. ""We trust you,"" they sayed and we were given a room. I must admit - for the price they asked I was expecting some rather sleazy establishment - boy was I wrong. The rooms were newly built and spotless clean. Not a single thing wrong. The bed was king sized, the blankets warm and soft. Cashmere. The room was simple, but looked really nice. Rooms are decorated by moroccan tiles and lot of work has been put into details. Service was excellent - the two brothers who run it are…",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 January 2011,3,got cold in the room,"Stayed at Marmar hotel in the beginning of January. Hotel seems to have just been built, but not completed. No air-con and TV in a room, empty places for some furniture. The most terrible was sleeping there - really cold! no heating, no air-cons. we put on all clothes we had and took all blankets they gave us, but it was not enough. and also it is a challenge to take a bath! breakfast is ok. The staff is helpful, they arranged us a car with a driver for 2 days, and we visited aid ben haddou, skoura and neighbourhood of the city for 1300 dhm. WiFi is available in a lobby, but in our room connection was poor. As a location to explore the surroundings the hotel is a good option.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 January 2011,4,Cold hotel,"New hotel is suburb of the city. Room had new furniture, but not all installed - TV, aircondition. We were there in january, it was cold in hotel, because there weren't heating and aircondition. We used blanket in room to warm up. Breakfast simple, but enough. Staff is very helpful. They helped us to organize our outing to castels.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 November 2010,4,Everything you need for a great price,"Hotel Marmar was a great hotel - it felt like a secon home with staff that goes above and beyond the call of duty, the rooms are spacious and clean, the bathrooms are modern (with excellent water pressure) and there's free wifi! Also, the breakfast that's included is the best breakfast we have had in Morocco during our three week stay and superb coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice!! The hotel can also provide you with car rental service at prices that beat any other rental place in town. Strongly recommend this hotel - you will not be disappointed.",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 October 2010,4,Pretty good place for the price...,"We traveled from Marrakech to Ouarzazate looking forth to go to the desert in Mhamid. I guess Ouarzazate and Zagora have been changing quite a lot recently since they are no longer small towns in the middle of the desert. The hotel is practically new, the price is really affordable and the location is amazing considering the bus station (5 minutes walking) and other buses companies. They also offer a car rental service which is incredibly good. We payed 35 euros per day for the car; it is possible to drive from Ouarzazate to Mhamid in one day and return. The trip and the landscapes really are worthy of a sudden stop (just be careful of the narrow way. The two guys in the hotel were more than welcoming and offered us tips about taxi prices, how to drive to Mhamid. They gave us…",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 October 2010,5,10/10,"Idir and Hassan are the most welcoming and kind hosts we have met - we got picked up and taken back to the bus station, they spoke great English and were very knowledeable about the area. The room and bathroom were very spacious and everywhere was clean and nicely decorated. The cafe attached to the hotel served a lovely breakfast and stayed open for all hours. The hotel is near to shops and places to eat. There was a very friendly, relaxed atmosphere about the place. I highly recommend staying here if you are in Ouarzazate!",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
 October 2010,5,99% Recommend!!!,"The smile with which I was received, the availability and kindness with which they treated me were excellent!! Idir was a true friend during my time here, their information and advice on Ouarzazate and surrounding areas were precious!! Clearly recommend!!!",Hotel_marmar,Ouarzazate
