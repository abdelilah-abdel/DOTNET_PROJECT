Special shout out to sisters Fatiha & Juidad and Khalid who were our breakfast and dinner staff. Exceptional is an understatement…. We have traveled around the world and have never seen or experience such professionalism , attention to detail and degree of service.

 October 2022,5,Perfect welcome to Morocco,"We accidentally arrived a day before our reservation.Chifii was so welcoming, even though the Villa Mandarine was fully booked for the night. He arranged a welcome drink for us and arranged a place to stay at a nearby bed and breakfast. He suggested we have some dinner and after he would arrange transportation for us. We could return the next day after breakfast. While we were dining, a room opened up for us as someone had cancelled. Chifii was clearly pleased that he could accommodate us.

 September 2022,5,Perfect tranquility,"Villa Mandarine was our first stop in a month-long trip around Morocco, and it was a beautiful way to begin. The property is tranquil and quiet, with extensive lush gardens. We had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant gardens, and all meals were excellent. Our room was on the second floor and overlooked the courtyard. It was light and airy, comfortably furnished (including Nespresso machine and kettle), and had a sitting room and a little balcony. The service was wonderful, and it was the perfect place to unwind after a couple of very long flights to get to Morocco! The Villa is quite far from the tourist sights and the Medina, so if you are looking for accommodation where you can walk to everything, this is probably not for you. But if you want excellent service and peaceful…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 January 2020,4,Beautiful grounds,"We stayed st this hotel as part of a group tour. While the grounds were lovely and we enjoyed the restaurant, I thought the room furnishings were a bit shabby and could use upgrading. There was also tacky-looking wallpaper on one wall. However, the room has some interesting art on the walls that I would have like to purchase. The service in the dining room for breakfast was a bit odd. Although there was plenty of staff, they didn't come by to ask if we wanted omelettes or pancakes, which are included, but have to be ordered separately. We had to flag someone down to give our order.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2019,5,Gorgeous Hotel Surrounded by Garden Oasis,"Wonderful, peaceful hotel surrounded by beautiful gardens. The hotel has a warm, welcoming lobby where the staff are friendly.

 October 2019,5,"Lovely Hotel, Set Amid Peaceful Gardens. Oasis in the City.","Hands down, my favorite hotel of a two week trip. Located in busy Rabat, the lovely gardens totally insulate the hotel from the bustle of the city. The building itself is charming, with rooms set around a central courtyard with fountain tinkling merrily away. The room was very large and comfortable, with a private outside seating area. Dining was also excellent (we had dinner and then breakfast there). Food was high quality, well-prepared, and delicious. If you want to get out of a cookie-cutter hotel and stay somewhere you feel at home, try Villa Mandarine.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2019,5,Gorgeous Grounds,"Spacious, almost vast hotel in delightful grounds. Staff, breakfasts, hospitality were all top notch. It was a treat to laze around the pool in the heat of the afternoon. The hotel is not in the city centre so a petite taxi is required to get there.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2019,5,Garden Oasis,"What a way to start our 19 day tour of Morocco (our 1st night in Casablanca doesn’t count as we spent the whole recovering from our flight. At 71, it takes longer to adjust)! Astonishment is an understatement. Our 2nd floor suite looked onto both the interior courtyard and the outside gardens. Comfort at every turn, from the bedding to the private balcony. The expansive gardens were designed to meander with surprises at every turn, a swimming pool here, a blue cow there. Fun and relaxing. The restaurant was excellent for both days of breakfasts and dinners. Staff was very professional, slightly aloof, but not enough to offend. The clientele was a mixture of professionals, and tourists. What do you expect in a capital city at one of its finest establishments? We have now stayed…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2019,5,Part of Gate 1 tour,"Hubby and I spent 2 nights here as part of our Gate 1 tour of Morocco. Absolutely beautiful! The grounds, pool, interior rooms, etc, all are decorated with Moroccan flair. Breakfast was tasty with many options, although the coffee was just so-so...wish more places would have automatic machines or Keurigs where you can choose your strength, etc. Reminded us of instant Nescafé. Also teabags with a hot water kettle in the rooms would be nice since breakfast doesn’t start until 7am. We had dinner one night here and it was very good...portions were huge. The chocolate cake was divine! We were in room #1...included a big bed, couch, several chairs, desk, TV, private patio, large bathroom. Front desk can exchange money which is a nice bonus. Great way to start our tour.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2019,5,Most beautiful grounds ever,This hotel is a gem. Warm. Efficient and friendly staff and the most beautiful grounds imaginable.

From providing hats and bathrobes and noodles at the pool to robes and slippers in the room no area of service is missed.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2019,5,"An oasis in Souissi, Rabat's upscale neighborhood","Clean, well-appointed rooms and bathrooms, beautiful and spacious garden to relax in, a wonderful lap pool, and a restaurant with delicious international (and Moroccan) food.

 July 2019,4,Beautiful garden,"This hotel is a private home converted i to a hotel, that makes you feel at home all the time. Very Moroccan style, with a lot of rooms. The restaurant is delicious, you have traditional Moroccan cuisine.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2019,5,Excellent family run hotel. Location is out of main downtown areas.,"Villa Mandarine was an excellent hotel in Rabat. Family owned and run, it was a very interesting mixture of Morocco and France. The food, service and the room were good. The hotel was a long way from down town, we could have used a cab, but we did walk the local shops and had an excellent burger in a food court of all places. I had the lamb dish for dinner at Villamarine and it was tough and dry - not very good. Breakfast was minimal continental style, we were not offered eggs.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2018,5,Like Staying at a Friend's Estate!,"This was our absolute favorite hotel throughout our whole tour in Morocco! There was something we liked in many of the others, but this lovely boutique/resort type hotel was just wonderful. As soon as we arrived, we loved the feel of the whole place. It was like as if you were invited to a friend's estate and that feeling stayed with you whenever you walked around the grounds and the inside of the hotel also. The flow from one room or area of the hotel to the next was just so warm and inviting. I loved the decor. Loved our room. I wished we could have stayed longer. Had our own little private garden. Again the decor is so unlike most hotels. Just like a home. Anyway, everything else was great. Outside gardens lovely. Food was great, service, very very good. We were…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2019,5,Perfect,"Set in and around beautiful gardens, our accommodation was very nice and comfortable, all the requirements for an enjoyable stay, coffee and tea making facilities in the room, a comfortable bed a lovely outlook from our room. We did indeed enjoy our time here. Drinks can be had overlooking the tranquil gardens. They have a great restaurant attached the food very good. Only negative comment was when my husband ordered a glass of St Emilion red with his dinner and was given a cheaper wine instead for the same price. He mentioned this to the owner who apologised. We recommend you see the bottle and have it poured at your table.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2019,5,Very luxurious and full of interesting art,"I must of taken a couple dozen photos of the courtyard and other public spaces as this was one very well displayed hotel. We had some time to kill so we toured the gardens, swam in the pool and played pool while waiting for the rest of our group to make it through the airport. It was a great place to relax and enjoy the area from. I would highly recommend it.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2019,5,Excellent stay! Gardens incredible!,The rooms are appointed so lovely. Large and spacious. Lovely artwork. Huge comfortable king size bed. Comfy pillows and blankets. Room air conditioning worked great. Bathroom has its own heater so after showering it’s warm. Luxurious robes and towels. Breakfast was a buffet. Enough to choose from.

 March 2019,4,great place and wonderful chef,"my stay was not really for long as it was for a quick lunch, but I had the chance to experience a great time, especially with imane she is really helpful and really nice and the best thing was that she can speak English as I had really some difficulties with French language, so thank you, and for sure i'll come back or ill try this time to book a room.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 January 2019,5,Excellent experience in lodging,"Beautiful converted villa set in a beautiful garden. From the moment we entered the vibe was unpretentious comfort and service. Excellent staff from front end to restaurant and housekeeping. We joined with a group tour from the U.S. and we pleasantly surprised at the high standard of a tour lodging. Very nicely decorated and visually interesting. Very nice touches through out the property, including fireplaces and fire pits to ward off the winter chill. Our room was in the main building on the first floor with a balcony overlooking the gardens. The room was in good order, very clean, and well maintained. The bedding, linens, and robes were top quality. Sleep quality was excellent due to the quiet grounds. Room wifi worked but not fast. The food service was excellent.…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2019,3,Disappointing,"This was one of the most expensive hotels on our trip to Morocco and Spain and by far the most disappointing. Upon arrival we spent the first two hours trying to get the internet to work in our room. For us this is essential to plan the rest of our day and evening. The problem could not be resolved so we went on our afternoon tour. When we returned the internet still did not work, so we spent another hour trying to get it to work. Finally the issue was resolved but it was very frustrating. The weather while we were in Rabat was not great, cool and raining, so I am sure we did not see the hotel at its best. We found the hotel cold and damp and the dining room musty. There is nothing around the hotel so you can’t just go for a walk to find a shop or restrauant. Dinner in the…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2018,5,best group of people,"I was referred to this Hotel by a friend. My stay and experience turned out to be one of my best ones. The staff are the sweetest people, bilingual mostly. At the restaurant, Emre ( I hope i spelled it correctly) , a lady server, fluent in English was the most attentive and kind one. At the lobby, Ait Allah Chafii is the sweetest man with a smiling face, ready to help any minute of the day. His help throughout my stay was just superb; poolside, lobby, ...... I loved the owners whom I met and we became friends at the first encounter, quite worldly and kind.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2018,5,A lovely secret off the main road,"We booked Villa Mandarine as a one night stay on our way from the coast to Fes. What a treat for us! The room was wonderful, bed comfortable and absolutely a restful stay. We do wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the property gardens and pool. Staff was great and always helpful. We had a nice dinner, not exceptional but adequate. Service was stellar. The only area of slight improvement would be in the breakfast buffet offerings. A little lackluster compared to the rest of this property.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2018,5,Marvelous Lodging and Dining,A wonderful hotel located in an orange grove. Beautiful gardens and relaxing atmosphere. The hotel was a family home that had been expanded into a welcoming pleasant lodge. Our room had intriguing decor and patio.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 March 2018,5,A Villa to Be,"This was our first ever visit to Morocco. We landed at the international airport and saw how hectic it was. First we were overwhelmed by it and we started questioning how we were ever gonna get to the Villa. Anyhow, we made it through the airport craziness and ended up at the footsteps of the Villa. We were welcomed with such energy and smiles and they helped us settle in the place. The staff are well trained, friendly and super helpful. They wanted us to be comfortable and happy during our stay here at the Villa. Before we went to our room, we were pretty hungry so we ate at the hotel's restaurant and the food was simply amazing. I think we had dinner here every night until we checked out.The villa has both the best features of French and Berber/Arab beauty. The place was just…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 November 2018,5,A Perfect Introduction to the Mysteries of Morocco,"This small boutique hotel was once the home of a French family who had moved to Morocco several generations previously. After the children had grown and moved out, the matriarch realized a long-held dream of creating a warm, inviting abode for weary travelers. After two years of unrelenting effort, the home was transformed into a very welcoming oasis that combines the best features of Moroccan and French beauty and sensibility. The hotel is located within a botanical paradise of mature orange trees, Birds of Paradise and innumerable other species of flowering, tropical plants. The grounds are meticulously maintained. The staff are well trained, friendly and very helpful. The hotel's restaurant is one of the best in Rabat. Our room on the second floor had a balcony that…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2018,5,Rabat lodging - beauty + care for worriers,We began our tour of Morocco in Rabat and through experience we’ve found that an extra day to recover from jet lag is a good idea. I waited too long to book the extra room and ended up in a suite for one night. The hotel helped relocate us to our regular ‘part of the tour’ room. I expected to feel a little disappointed but every room is stellar. The attention to detail is what sets it apart. We used the hotel to arrange transportation from Casablanca to the hotel and they were wonderful at confirming all the detail - super for a worrier like me. Thank you Anass Kabourim and Imane Louali! Be sure to look at ‘The Story’ to learn how it came to be AND absolutely take a stroll through the gardens.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 November 2018,4,Beautiful grounds and Helpful Staff,"The grounds of this hotel are beautiful - we really enjoyed eating outside and taking a walk around each morning. The hotel staff was very helpful, Chafi in particular. We had a situation where the petit-taxi driver who drove us from downtown Rabat to the villa was charging us double what the meter showed and there was language barrier between us. I went to reception for help and Chafi immediately came to our assistance - he asked security to stop the petit-taxi and prevent him from leaving. He ran down to the taxi then returned a couple of minutes later (slightly out of breath since he had ran) with our money. We were amazed that he went the extra mile just so we were not swindled on taxi fare. We also had a situation where my husband lost his wallet during one of our…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2018,5,A very nice break from the hustle and bustle,"We spent some time in the Medinas around the north of Morocco. They are busy and dense and sometimes even a bit dirty. Fun for a while, but this spot is a little bit away from the center of Rabat. It was so nice to spend a few days in pampered luxury outside the busiest parts of town. We had a car which made getting in and out of the rest of Rabat easy.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2018,4,Nice find in Rabat,"Very pretty hotel in a lush garden setting. Rooms are large and are nicely appointed. Not situated in the city center but has a very nice restaurant that has an innovative and varied menu.

My wife asked to taste a wine with which she was not familiar and the waiter never came back to see if she liked it and wanted a glass.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2018,5,One of our favorite hotels,The hotel is beautiful inside and out. The grounds are expertly manicured with statues scattered throughout the property. The inside of the hotel is spacious but cozy with all the connected common rooms and open atrium There is a nearby mall with a grocery store and food court. We bought some jams to take home as souvenirs since they were in Arabic and very inexpensive. We ate at the second floor burger restaurant and had onion rings and an Oreo shake which were delicious. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was good. The servers will bring you eggs to order which we appreciated. There is a bar and billiard room at the hotel and a library tucked into a cozy room that leads outside. A great hotel!,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2018,4,Lovely stay,We stayed here for a few days at the start of a tour. What a treat! Our room on the ground floor so I only had to step out onto a patio and into the Great gardens. Book your hammam in advance as there is limited availability. The dining room served up some fabulous food and the maitre D was great.

 April 2018,3,Lovely Villa away from Rabat city center with pretty garden,"There are flowering trees along the walk to the Villa entrance which makes for a nice entry. My room was one of the suites. There was a separate room with a central seating area and another area where you could sit by windows overlooking the beautiful courtyard. The furniture feels a little dated. There was fruit and biscotti on the table. A nice welcoming touch. I ordered tea from room service and it arrived with the hot water but no tea. Had to call again to get the tea. They were very apologetic about the mistake. The bedroom was very nice, comfortable and I slept well. Once the rain cleared a bit I took a walk around the gardens. Very pretty garden with fruit trees, exotic flowering trees and sculptures. I was with a small group for dinner and we had…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

The overall impression is mostly very pleasant in the classic Moroccan fashion with the all the standard Moorish motif although it is not as heavily decorated like the riads in Fes. The hotel rooms are quite large and comfortable with lots of space and the beds are comfortable enough for the 2 night stays. I would not think that it's an exceptional hotel but base in its rating in TripAdvisor, it is one of the top hotels in town.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2018,5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!,"This hotel is the real and authentic Moroccan style you want!! First off the hotel is beautiful inside and out. The grounds of the property are unreal, and the amenities inside are nothing but the best. The rooms were very spacious, we had a lovely living area that connect to a good size bedroom and nice bathroom. However the best part of Villa Mandarine was the hospitality of all the workers. My sister fried her phone their because our converter we had was not the proper kind and the service we received to fix it was amazing. We must of had about 6 people helping us, even one of the owners. They couldn't have been anymore helpful and willing to go out of their way to fix this. I would certainly recommend this hotel to everyone and if I'm ever in Rabat again I know where I'll be…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

The large pool was heated and the restaurant served excellent food. Both traditional Moroccan and classic French. Wonderful classic art adorns the walls. There is a pool table in a cozy room. The staff was attentive and friendly. Highly enjoyable place to stay.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Charming and cosy!,I really fell in love with this place. The hotel is set in a lovely surrounding with lots of places to enjoy a drink outside. The pool is lovely and the gardens around the pool are just perfect. Staff was very friendly and dinner more than perfect. Just one drawback: the gym is in the same area as the spa. During my massage (terrific!!!) you hear the running belt. The lady tried to cover up by relaxing music but the sound was too hard. A pity. Would certainly go back again!,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Wonderful introductin to Marocco,"A great start of a 15 day tour of Morocco. Our first floor room was very spacious, with a large bathroom which had a full tub with shower. The private grassed patio area off the bedroom was a bonus, although the weather was cool at the beginning of April, so we could not take advantage of it. The smell orange blossoms by the front entrance to the hotel was wonderful. We had an excellent opening dinner to the start of our trip in the dining room. Staff were very professional and accommodating.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2018,5,Relaxing in every way.,A very nice and spacious hotel that had a lot of charisma and uniqueness to it. It was decorated well and all fixtures and fittings were in a good state of repair with the exception to some furniture in the pool area that could do with an upgrade and general clean. The room service was efficient. We enjoyed a massage from the spa followed by a drink in the lounge. Would certainly visit again.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2018,5,I love this place,"Nicest, coziest hotel in Rabat. Beautifully and eclectically furnished. Set in lovely gardens full of citrus trees and flowers. Nice restaurant and good breakfast.

 February 2018,5,Lovely,"We stayed here as part of a tour and really enjoyed it. Our room was spacious and had a patio with orange trees. Walking through the property was a pleasure. Not only were there orange trees- there were also loquats, palms and huge hydrangeas. The courtyard was lovely, too. The bathroom had a great bath and the heater below the towel rack dried everything beautifully.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2018,5,"""Setting the tone for a fabulous Moroccan experience"".....","Whilst my wife has been to Europe 3 times, this was my first experience ""traveling abroad"". I had no idea what to expect, but since most of my travel has been to ""fishing destinations"" in Central America, I seem to prefer a ""Third World Experience"" with a ""dash of panache"". I realize that Morocco is a dichotomy of 21st century hustle & bustle in Casa Blanca & Rabat contrasted by an old world experience that can be had east of the Atlas Mountains for example in Erfoud, Merzouga & Ouarzazet. When we arrived at Villa Mandarine we were greeted with the traditional tea by a very accommodating staff. The grounds of the villa were lush & the orange trees heavy with fruit. The rooms & courtyard were delightful and there were all manner ""eye treats"" to be enjoyed on ones…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2018,5,Beautiful French-country style atmosphere,"I very much enjoyed the 2 nights I stayed here. The garden grounds and decorations were beautiful. I'd describe the style as French country but also somewhat eclectic. The corridors were adorned with many interesting and attractive items: pottery pieces, paintings, etc., that made it enjoyable to walk around and examine everything. The frequent singing of birds was a delight. Our room was very clean and comfortable, not a huge size but quite adequate. The small balcony area with table and chairs overlooking a garden area was a nice touch. We had two breakfasts; the quantity of selections was not large but the quality was very good. We had one dinner here; the harira soup and pastilla dessert were delicious, but the leg of lamb main course was overcooked and tough. I only…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 January 2018,5,Wonderful introduction to Morocco.,This hotel was arranged through our Gate 1 Discovery Tour of the Allure of Morocco. We loved our two night stay. Everything was beautifully done.

 November 2017,5,Elegant little oasis in the city of Rabat,"We spent our first two nights in Morocco at this hotel (riad) on November 13 and 14 at the begining of our tour. The photos used on their website are somewhat dull and mundane and do not do justice to this beautiful boutique hotel. We were assigned to room #1 located on the ground floor; the room was relatively large with seperate entrance, bath room and toilet. I was very pleased that our room had a small patio with a small private backyard with jasmin and citrus trees. As all riad, there was a cortyard, a fountain and garden inside the building. The ground was expansive with numerous citrus trees, flouring shrubs and palm trees; very soothing and gave me an excellent first impression of the country. Altough it was not in the central part of the city, there was a small…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2017,5,Simply stunning,"From the moment you arrive in this private oasis tucked away from the city, the smell of orange blossom drifts through the air scenting the hotel with a delightful perfume. Everything about this place is gorgeous from the well appointed rooms with private courtyard garden, to the gourmet food, the large outdoor pool and cabana, through to the very tame peacock that wanders through the courtyard at breakfast as you try and resist yet another pastry or fresh-made Moroccan pancake with honey or orange jam.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2017,4,Great Place To Relax,"A very nice hotel. Very comfortable and nice grounds. The pool is outdoor,although it is heated to around 80 degrees, not useable in winter for most people. Fun pool table though, and a good restaurant too!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2016,5,Exquisite property great service,"We stayed here on our way to Fes from Marrakesh, and to meet friends working in Rabat. While our stay was short it was memorable enough for us to recommend this venue to our hosts and their endless list of constant guests. The gardens are gorgeous and it seems in constant blooming. The sweet smell of gardenias and yellow honey suckles is everywhere. It is how I remember this place. The Mid century decor of the common areas pays tribute to the architecture of this colonial village turned hotel. The breakfast was great . We had dinner at an official venue in town by our hosts, so we could not enjoy dinner. The staff and service were excellent. The hotel has many places where one can seat to write a travel journal and read and relax. The gardens are sumptuous , mandarins and…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Beautiful hotel and grounds,"The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The gardens and flowers are amazing. The hotel also has a pool (not heated).

 October 2017,5,A Beautiful Place to Relax,"What a great introduction to Morocco! I loved this incredible hotel. The rooms were a lovely combination of luxury and comfort. The grounds were fragrant and lush; as you wandered along you encountered garden art and the occasional peacock. Each room had its own private patio. My friends enjoyed the swimming pool. The food in the restaurant was delicious, serving both Moroccan and European fare. I am happy to give this lovely villa my highest recommendation!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2017,5,Excellent service,The service is excellent in this beautiful property. It is a lovely hotel with a very romantic cachet and the garden is beautiful. The service is extreme attentive to details. I recommend this first class property in Rabat.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2017,5,a stunning introduction to Morocco,"My inaugural tour of Morocco started here and cannot imagine a more delightful introduction to Moroccan style, service and taste. There is so much to appreciate about this property - its salubrious and very quiet location, the lush and expansive gardens, the delightful cuisine (the pot set orange flower yoghurt and local pink grapefruit not to be missed at breakfast), the gorgeous artifacts, carpets, ceramics, the solicitous staff and very comfortable rooms with balconies flooded in sunshine. The pool is a welcome respite after sightseeing around this wonderful city. I cannot wait to return next year with my travel group as this years guests adored it as much as I did,",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2017,5,Stunning Property amongst the orange groves,"Wish I had been able to enjoy a longer stay at this gorgeous Hotel in Rabat. As it turned out because I was on a tour we did not arrive until close to 7.00 pm and then left at 9.am next morning. In the short hours I was a guest I was very impressed. The gardens were magnificent - I took a stroll in the morning, saw many birds and put a foot in the pool. Our room was lovely, spacious and clean with nice amenities. Room keys are quirky - nice touch. Dinner in the restaurant was delicious and the service good despite the fact we were a large group eating late. Breakfast next morning offered a great selection. The shop appeared to have a nice selection of items but was closed whilst we were there. Would love to return and enjoy a relaxed stay for 2 nights with my family.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 September 2017,5,The best hotel in Rabat,"This place is really nice, clean and relaxing. We live in Rabat but we like having relaxing weekends in hotels. Villa Mandarine has beautiful bedrooms, food is amazing and service is great. All staff are very professional and friendly. We are hoping booking a few weekends in this hotel. We felt like being at home. Breakfast is very nice as well. The swimming pool is really good as well. We tried Sofitel in Rabat before that and it was rubbish, they are far behind! Villa Mandarine beat them easily in term of services! Book Villa Mandarine, you will not regret it!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2017,5,A beautiful and amazing property in Rabat,"My wife and two sons stayed just for one night - unfortunately. This is striking beautiful property in the middle of orchard and garden with many birds singing. Rooms were large, clean and interesting. The pool was large and heated. We had dinner and breakfast at the restaurant and food and service and prices were all very good. The only drawback is that the hotel is not near the downtown area, so not really any place to walk to...but the gardens and hotel is so beautiful that you don't really think about it. Definitely recommend for anyone going to Rabat.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2017,2,Disappointing although nice gardens,"I was delighted by the beautiful and mature garden, that's the one nice point... as for the rest, the rooms are nice but getting old (furniture, bath, carpets...) , the passage between the restaurant & the reception zone and the rooms zone has a weird roof... the spa is also getting old and out of date... the worst is the bar and the terrace.... around 5 pm it gets full of locals who come there to drink ... as smoking is allowed , the whole bar restaurant terrace reception zone stinks.... even at breakfast, it still smells... really sad...",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2017,5,Nice and serene,"The hotel location in a quite street in residential area of Rabat. Gated entrance to the property for residents. The hotel is full of greenery and plants and small and large birds running around in the hotel garden which makes it a relaxing experience . Check in is fast and welcoming. Hotel is like historical mansion with Arabic style architectural design, where by the rooms surrounds the courtyard. They have large swimming pool.I stayed twice within a week ,a night each and was given different rooms each with its own different colors, both are nice , spacious and clean and all have the amenities you need.

 August 2016,5,A Brilliant Mistake,"On my Morocco tour (circa 2007) my dad had come to join me for the final 5 days of my month-long adventure. After an interesting time getting lost in Fes, and experiencing some rather intense hammams in Chefchaouen, it was time to make our way to the capital - Rabat. Driving along the dirt roads masquerading as motorways we eventually found it; a big sprawling city with about as many donkey vehicles as actual motorised vehicles and the typical bustling atmosphere we were becoming used to in Morocco, tho with that added granure gloss typical of a capital city. We had actually booked this hotel by accident (hence the title of this review) but it was a fantastic accident! It was like somewhere you would imagine James Bond would stay in - you're met with a gold gilt chandelier…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 April 2017,5,Unwind in Another Era,Very comfortable with a wonderful old world ambiance. You feel not only like you are in another country but another era of bygone colonial elegance. Both the rooms and the beautiful grounds provide a feeling of space and tranquility.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2017,4,Oasis of calm after long haul flight,"Room a little small for twin share but bathroom facilities etc good. Better to avoid west facing room as very warm, lots of little bugs. Breakfast on the terrace lovely especially the home made yoghurt and garlic bread with tomato reduction. Gardens lovely and pool good for swimming. Restaurant food so so.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2017,5,Just beautiful,"We started our visit to Morocco in Rabat at the Villa Mandarin. What a beautiful property, rooms, gardens. Service wonderful, staff helpful and friendly. We don't usually eat on site, but given the location, there were not other options if on foot. Food was good, not the least disappointing. Lots of outdoor space to sit and enjoy a glass of wine. Asked for some munchies and we're presented with a tray with olives, nuts and cookies on it. Outstanding. The only drawback was the distance from town, but the rest more than made up for it!,",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2017,2,Overpriced restaurant with a nice outdoor terrace,"I stayed at the hotel, so I was captured audience and had 3 breakfasts and 3 dinners there. Also a few drinks at the bar. Here is the verdict: It is a decent restaurant, but for the price it is not worth it. The food is very uneven. Some dishes are great (tagine di lapin, food gras poilee), some are cafeteria style (Moroccan salad), and the Italian-inspired dishes (although for some reason on the French menu) are not good at all (bar et risotto aux seiches, beuf semi cuit et fois gras). Finally on wines: I ordered half-bottles twice, and the wine was good. Last night I made a HUGE mistake of ordering wine by the glas: it is expensive, bad quality and tiny portions. They probably squeeze 8 glasses out of a bottle. Breakfast is ok: first day is nice because they have excellent…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 April 2017,5,One night stay in a great villa,"Stayed for one night as part of a tour. The villa was lovely. The staff were very attentive. Our room looked out on to the orange groves with lush flowers and peacocks. The room had good air conditioning and wifi. Pool was nice and free mint tea and lemonade was provided. Our dinner was lovely, sitting outside on the patio. Tasty tagines. Breakfast was a little limited but still overall pretty good. Hotel is not located near anything but embassies.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2017,5,Hotel in a Garden,"Set in an old mandarine grove, La Villa Mandarine provides a serene and comfortable break from the bustling city of Rabat. The rooms on two levels off the typical, beautiful, relaxing courtyard each have either a balcony or patio, made completely private by the carefully maintained mandarine trees. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom well appointed, the closets spacious. We ate dinner in the restaurant and found the food excellent. We also loved the breakfast buffet. The weather was cool when we stayed there, so we didn't use the heated pool but loved walking around the gardens and sitting around the pool.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2017,5,Outstanding way to start our visit to Morocco,Villa Mandarine is an exquisite example of blended Moroccan and French hospitality. The room was spacious beautifully decorated with a garden patio. The grounds are lush and and expansive with outdoor dining and a swimming pool. It is located in a residential area about a $4 taxi ride to central Rabat.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2017,5,Amazing,"After arriving at the hectic train station in Rabat, arriving at Villa Mandarine was a welcome surprise. We are staying here as part of a Gate 1 tour. They always choose the best hotels. Taxi from the train station is about $2.50. Take a blue metered taxi. See my review on the taxis from the Agdal Rabat train station. Dinner in the restaurant was amazing. Some of the best food i have ever had. Try the wine from the region. Tip - included in the breakfast buffet is a ""made to order"" menu. We didn't realize this until we filled our plates and sat down. The menu is better. This hotel is not near attractions, but you will welcome the peace and beauty of this hotel.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2017,4,Nice location with nice gardens in the back - Away from the city,"This was a nice, quiet area away from the city. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We stayed just one night, but had a good time, and had good service. The gardens behind the hotel might be one of its best assets.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2017,4,A Lovely property,"We enjoyed our one night stay at this hotel. The property is located in the embassy district in Rabat. The property is on lovely grounds with beautiful gardens, patios, a gorgeous courtyard and a pool. There are many nice public rooms, including a living room type area, billiard room and bar. There are lots of beautiful flowers and fruit trees on the grounds which give the place a wonderful smell. Our room was large and comfortable with a large bath including a bath shower combo and a separate toilet. There was a weak hairdryer and wifi was spotty. We called reception when we could not connect to the wifi and though they came upstairs to help they were not able to fix it and though they promised to return they never did. It eventually worked but not particularly well.…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2017,4,It would be great with a better service,"The Villa Mandarine offers something different from the standard hospitality industry and this is very pleasant. The setting in a big park is lovely. The rooms are big, furnished with taste and with a nice terrace. But, unfortunately, the service is not at the same level. The staff is polite but not welcoming both at the reception and in the restaurant. Tip: location is good for business (close to many business locations) but too far from the historical center for tourists.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2017,5,Villa Mandarine,"Perfect retreat from hustle and bustle of Rabat. Lovely spacious, clean and eclectic decorated rooms, perfect setting, great food and friendly staff. The best in Rabat and I have been visiting for 20 years! Must try but please leave space for me!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2017,5,Beautiful and serene atmosphere,"The hotel was converted from a private residence of the orange grove owner. The main part was the home and has several rooms off the bar set up with comfortable seating for relaxation and conversation. Even has a billiards room. The rooms are spacious and have a private balcony overlooking the beautiful grounds. The buildings and gardens are interwoven amongst the orange trees. Note there is no conditioner, only shampoo provided. Food was excellent. Breakfast buffet with make to order eggs and pancakes. As others have said it's in a residential area, about a $3-$4 taxi ride from the medina. Very beautiful and serene place.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2017,5,lovely hotel in an orange grove,We spent one night here. Gardens and orange trees are lovely to walk around. Room was very nice.

 February 2017,5,"Beautfiul, peaceful place","Overall lovely hotel. Beautiful grounds. A ways from the old town, but cabs are really cheap. We were there in cool, rainy weather so not able to fully take advantage of the outdoor space. Friendly, professional staff.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 January 2017,5,So very lovely in every way,"In a month long tour throughout Morocco, the Villa Mandarine was my favorite stay. The grounds and decor are a beautiful blend of Moroccan and French styles. Everything about the hotel is just splendid. The rooms are large, very comfortable, tastefully decorated and the many living areas are diverse and provide great places to relax. Breakfast is good and typical of the nicer hotels. The dinners (while a bit pricey) are elegant and wonderful with great choices for everyone's taste. Dinners there were the best cuisine during my trip which is a high compliment since Moroccan food is wonderful. I highly recommend having dinner there. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They arranged for airport pickup which was appreciated and also arranged a day tour for Casablanca.…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2017,4,Elegant Hotel,Very nice Hotel in the garden with lots of orange trees. Spacious and clean rooms with very good services. Excellent breakfast and good dinner. Outside of city center but in a very nice environment. Highly recommended.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2016,5,beautiful,"one of the most beautiful hotels i have ever visited of course, service was great! highly recommend, although rabat is a less than exciting place to visit but great for on the way between casablanca and fez",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2016,3,A Little Dated,"Maybe they are going for the classic look and feel of the movie ""Casablanca'"" but maybe they need some updating. Certainly clean and reasonably comfortable, but not a luxury property. Good restaurant with nice variety for dinner and adequate but not memorable for breakfast. Not sure about other available properties, but would probably ask around before booking here.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Gate 1 Organised tour of Morocco,"The ambience could not have ben better. A combination of French and Moroccan architecture. It is full of wonderful corners outside, with tables and chairs. All different, lots of green and lots of mosaic tiles. The rooms are very comfortable and you have visiting peacocks in your own outdoor space. The swimming pool and table tennis facilities will delight young and old. Two nights here, left us wanting for more!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Great initiation in Morocco,This lovely hotel is situated in a quiet neighborhood on expansive grounds with lovely trees and plants. When I entered my room and opened the curtain to my private patio there was a lovely peacock resting on the flagstone right outside my window. The bar and restaurant have serene views of the gardens and the food is delicious.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Lush and colonial,"Lovely hotel and a nice contrast to the typical riad. Wonderful gardens and lovely French colonial atmosphere. Rooms are large and tasteful; pool is heated and just long enough to be able to swim laps; food is quite good, but it is the tropical lushness, flowers, fruit trees and peacocks that make it stand out.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2015,5,If you miss this wonderful hotel it will be your loss!,"We stayed at Villa Mandarine while on an extended tour of Morocco. It was without a doubt one of the best hotel experiences we have had in our many years of world travels. The food, staff, accommodations were all first rate. It was much more than we had expected. As an example, we had an issue with some of our photography equipment and the owners stepped up and made sure we had the contacts necessary to secure a fix and continue to record our journey. The gardens are world-class and it was incredibly enjoyable to just sit outside and take it all in. If you are visiting Rabat this is the place to stay.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2016,5,Beautiful Grounds and lovely service!,This is an excellent place to stay when visiting Rabat. It is away from the city a bit but the grounds are so lovely and the restaurant so nice that you want mind. This is a lovely haven away from the business that is Rabat. Pool is wonderful and the grounds are filled with flowers and fruit. A great place to explore. Great Service,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2016,5,Lovely place and service,"The bad thing is that the hotel is quite far from the train station. Other than that the place is an oasis. When we arrived at dinner time we could smell the flowers and trees already in the taxi, and it stayed with us. We only stayed there one night, but both Rabat and the hotel deserves more time. The building is lovely, like a fairy tale at night, the rooms are very spacious with terrace and the smell of flowers is all over. The staff is nice and they know their job.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

This is a gem, Morocco at its best.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2016,5,Perfectly quiet stay in a beautiful garden,"We stayed there for 2 nights (a couple, 4 kids and a baby). The staff was very helpful and responsive (above Moroccan average). The owners were present and checked that we were properly settled. The food was excellent. The scenery is beautiful with bedrooms well isolated from each other's, and from the other parts of the hotel. The great plus of this place is the huge garden, packed with orange trees. Only (small) area of improvement: the staff sometimes forgets to bring an order. This is still worth 5 ratings. We will come back. Perfect for a 2/3 nights stay to rest and enjoy Rabat.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2016,5,High Morrocan Cuisine,"There is nothing better than to cool down in a beautiful garden having a cocktail and watching the few chickens and paons. The meal is excellent as well as the wines, and the waitresses are well dressed (and with a fez) and really attentive. It's upper class, but fair. We had supper with four colleagues and had no noisy impact on our conversation. A hotel is next-door, but we haven't insights. So, next time staying in Rabat I'll try to book there!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,5,Tranquil luxury..,"I had heard it was a Boutique Hotel but nothing prepared me for the beauty of this retreat. The lush gardens and rich Moroccan colors make for tremendous ambiance. I had a room with two single beds, a balcony, bath with bathtub and shower. I had one meal here and it was fantastic. The staff members are extremely helpful. The hotel has an old world charm with beautiful rugs and antique furniture decorating the rooms and common areas. If you're looking to create amazing memories of your time in Rabat, this is the place to book.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2016,5,A tranquil haven,"My partner and I spent 4 nights at Villa Mandarine back in June 2016. The hotel is tucked away and we felt so calm and relaxed here. The gardens are beautifully attended with a mixture of colour and scents. The hotels interior is a feast for the eyes, clean and very well designed. It is traditionally done but with modern comforts. Our room was also very well thought out, and spacious with nice little touches like the tagine filled with biscuits. We spent a lot of time at the outdoor pool, which I don't think was heated - it doesn't need to be as the weather was so hot. There are handy showers and changing facilities poolside too. The service was friendly and efficient, a great choice for breakfast and delicious dinner menu. We are very much looking forward to returning next year.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2016,5,A puppy-friendly and charming marvel,"We stayed at the Villa Mandarine for 5 nights during Ramadan. The setting is spectacular - in a perfectly landscaped orange grove. The service was impeccable and the staff and management very friendly. I was travelling with my Chihuahua and he was made to feel at home everywhere in the hotel. Breakfast was outside as the weather was warm. If you're lucky and he's in a good mood, you might be delighted with the visit of the peacock who lives there with his family. The hotel is full of charm. It is exquisitely furnished with beautiful paintings and antique furniture adorning all the rooms. The hotel has a garden within it which makes it very bright and pleasant. It is a pleasure to come back to the hotel after a hectic day and to escape the noise and heat of the city.

The rooms are on two levels around a central courtyard full of roses and palms and from the outside, balconies and patios are guaranteed privacy by artfully planted gardens. The hotel is built in a citrus grove and the gardens are a delight, bursting with colour from hibiscus, hydrangeas, lantana, plumbago, datura, geraniums, bougainvillea, aubretia and more. A pair of peacocks wander through this Eden. Every morning on my balcony a scattering of jasmine flowers perfumed the air. My room was decorated in harmonious blues and greys with a large dressing area, big bathroom with tadlakt walls, TV, mini bar and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Everywhere in the hotel the floors are covered with…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2016,3,Beautiful hotel but,"What a fabulous setting for a hotel. Wonderful gardens, great rooms, great setting. You won't get the 5 star things you get from the big hotel chains but who cares. Orange trees all around, flowers all over, nice relaxing pool area. Food was really good. Reasonable selection of local and French wines. Loved it Ok so now the down side. I was there during Ramadan. Obviously I wasn't a Muslim so the service you get is poor if you were like me, an Englishman abroad. Asking several times for a bottle of wine, watching as everyone else gets waiter service (almost) when it's a buffet, snacks etc on the table. Me? Got nothing like it. Three days of exactly the same. Took me ten minutes and two waiters to get a spoon! Very frustrating. Ok so I knew the time of year but I'm a guest…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,5,Perfect beginning,What a perfect beginning to our Moroccan adventure. We arrived late our first night after a very long flight from Portland Oregon. Made longer as we had to wait for our luggage at the Casablanca airport for the next flight. The Villa Mandarine was wonderful. Our room had a wonderful terrace that overlooked Mandarine trees. The food and service at the lovely dinning room was wonderful. Hopefully we will able to return soon.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,5,A Sultan's paradise with modern conveniences,"What a beautiful hotel. The grounds are spectacular with splashes of color everywhere and the hanging tumpet blossoms were magical. I adored this place, my favorite place we stayed our 15 days in Morocco. There is every amenity available in the room and your own private patio. The courtyard is a maze of mosaics and is absolutely stunning in the night light. The restaurant was top notch. I only have superlatives for this wonderful place.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,4,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel in the suburbs of Rabat. Spent our first 2 nights here at the beginning of a 2-week visit to Morocco. Great place to ""transition"" to our new environs. Gardens and rooms are beautiful. Restaurant was good. Most of the guests appeared to be internationals in Morocco for business. Only negative (repeated elsewhere) was that both the indoor and outdoor bar allow smoking, which kept us from enjoying some very lovely spaces, although there are plenty of lovely non-smoking spaces. It would be a great place to stay if traveling with children...nice pool, extensive gardens and large rooms.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,5,A Garden of Eden in the city,"It is always a pleasure to return the this hotel, it is quiet, calm and so doesn't fit with your usual vision of a business hotel. It is more like a retreat. But don't be fooled it offers everything the business traveller requires. Give it a go....it will transform your view of hotels!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,4,4 Nights at Villa Mandarine,"We stayed at the Villa Mandarine for 4 nights and didn't venture off the property. This is a beautiful older property that used to be the private residence of a French couple who moved to Rabat. It was converted into a hotel property and still maintains the beautiful acreage of flowers and fruit trees. The property is still run by the grandson of the original owners who can often be seen in the dining room with his family. I would have to give the hotel great ratings although I would not give such high ratings to the dining room for various reasons. I will comment on this as well, which I found to be true all over Morocco but was particularly acute here in the dining facility. If you speak no French, then you should study up on some before you go. French and Arabic are spoken…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,5,What a splendid place! You'll feel wonderful being here,"Villa Mandarine was formerly a grand private home that shows what happens when taste and money are present at the same time. But this is not so much a grand place as a warm and welcoming place From the lovely gardens to the several outdoor seating spaces, you feel completely at peace and surrounded by beauty.. The public rooms feel serene and comfortable, and the guestrooms are quite nicely appointed. The restaurant is pleasant, and the hotel staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful. You'll feel wonderful being here. I promise!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2015,5,Home Away From Home!,"Best Hotel in Morocco. I work as a consultant for the UN and I have seen a few. Staff in the most gracious, and very capable. Rooms are splendid. Except for the gym , amenities are first rate, including the pool. The bar should be ""No Smoker"", but that is another issue. The restaurant is wonderful.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,5,Luxury and Comfort,This is an exquisite boutique hotel. Our room was luxurious and comfortable with a balcony overlooking beautiful gardens. The dining room offers fine cuisine and we enjoyed dinner and breakfasts served there. We stayed on a tour not sure if it would be easy to find on your own.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,5,Outstanding hotel !,The best option in a Rabat if you are looking for some serenity and peace. The design is amazing with all the outstanding details. Service is perfect and friendly. The room is comfortable and the value for money is excellent !,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Nice Riad in the outskirts of Rabat,"Review of Villa Mandarine, Rabat, Morocco We stayed at the Villa Mandarine for 2 nights in April 2016 as the first stop on a two week tour of Morocco. Our group of four occupied two of the hotel’s “standard” rooms on the ground floor. The hotel is located within the exclusive Agdal area of Rabat also known as the “embassy” section and was originally a private estate. It is a 10-15 minute taxi ride from downtown Rabat. Taxis in Morocco will transport 3 or fewer people, so we needed 2 taxis for our group of four every time we left the hotel. The fare ranged from $3-5 USD (30-50 DH) per taxi each way. The hotel has a large living room with a fireplace, a billiards room, a bar and small terraces shaded by bougainvillea, jasmine or datura. The garden at the hotel covers…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2016,4,A truly nice Villa,"In the outskirts of Rabat, this is a nice respite from the city. Very nice gardens and swimming pool, this villa is away from the hustle and bustle of city life. They have a full bar and restaurant on property. Plenty of alcoves and sitting areas to have a drink and relax. We enjoyed our stay here before beginning a tour of Rabat and Morocco. Rooms were spacious with a nice sitting area and patio. The management or owners were personally checking rooms and their guests needs.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2016,4,Beautiful Gardens,Lovely stay in this converted hotel with beautiful gardens and courtyards to explore. The Riad still feels very private as if you are a guest in an interesting historic or traditional home. Dinner in the restaurant was quite good and reasonably priced.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2016,5,Beautiful setting!,Nice hotel set in beautiful gardens. The citrus trees were blooming and the smell was delicious. The rooms were comfortable and the restaurant served good meals. A quiet retreat. The resident peacock put on a show for us.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2015,4,Restful garden hotel to retreat to after a busy day touring,"Maybe not as glamorous as some, but quiet and comfortable. Lovely to stroll through the gardens or swim in the pool. We were here on New Year's eve and had a fantastic dinner in the restaurant here. The staff were cordial and responded to all our requests. Being able to walk out of our room onto the patio and then out into the gardens was the best.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2016,4,Beautiful hotel,"While on a tour of Morocco our first stop was here at Villa Mandarine. You have everything you need here in one spot.

Very quiet hotel. Free wifi that actually works. Excellent restaurant & bar area. Friendly staff & helpful.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2016,5,Beautiful grounds,"Although a ways outside the main attractions of Rabat, Villa Mandarine is a beautiful retreat in a residential area. Once a private estate, the grounds are immaculately maintained. The rooms are quaint and very comfortable. Our first floor room had a private patio surrounded by orange trees and hibiscus. The staff was politely friendly and the food in the restaurant was very good.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2016,5,Moroccan Gem. 🇲🇦,"Beautiful gardens, Beautiful people. If you want peace and quiet and a truly Moroccan feel, this is the place to stay in Rabat. As you would expect from Morocco the food is to die for, full of spice and flavour. Highly recommended.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2015,2,Beautiful place but disappointed with the lack of responsiveness + customer service,"First thing's first: I haven't stayed at this villa. I visited this place with my fiance as we were trying to find suitable accommodation for our wedding guests, as we will be having our wedding in Rabat in April. We spoke with one of the French owners and agreed that I would contact him later with my needs and requirements. The place itself is beautiful, with a lot of space and lush garden atmosphere, and looks very peaceful and tranquil, with a few peacocks roaming around at leisure. We visited the rooms as well and each one was very quaint and nice. There was a pool available, but the problem was that it looked unkept and not clean, but I guess I can attribute it to the fact that it was October and not really swimming season? I would say the prices are a bit expensive for…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2015,5,A Charming Oasis to Relax and Unwind,"We recently traveled to Morocco where we explored this magnificent desert country from.our base in Rabat, Villa Mandarine provided a charming, relaxed and extremely comfortable base for us. The beautifully manicured gardens and appointed rooms provided for a very relaxing stay. Excellent restaurant, bar and internet wifi with a great pool area which our 3 children made the most of. The French and Moroccan staff are very welcoming and provide an excellent level of service, this place was a magnificent find for us...........",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 January 2016,5,Superb Hotel,A superb hotel set amongst a mandarine grove and lush gardens. This was our first visit to Rabat and we were recommended the Villa and it lived up to its excellent reputation. We were a family of three travelling with an adult daughter and felt as if we were coming home from the moment we stepped through the front doors. Our rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. We ate in the restaurant a number of times and enjoyed excellent food and service. The Hamam experience is a must do. This family run hotel is very special.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2015,5,"Lovely, tranquil setting","We were with a small tour group, using a small bus, so the location was not a problem. But it is not located close to the downtown. But the hotel itself is a lovely accommodation, surrounded by lush gardens and trees. The restaurant is good, the bar is small and convivial, the pool is also nice. I enjoyed the quiet calmness of the place.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 January 2016,5,"Tranquil, Spacious Boutique hotel set amid beautiful Mandarin gardins","Lovely boutique hotel. Hotel grounds (well-landscaped with pointsettas, fruit trees, and lush and gorgeous gardens) and public spaces (lush courtyards & dining areas with a mix of colonial era & traditional Moroccan decor) were an absolute delight. Rooms were simple but extremely comfortable. Breakfasts (included) & dinners were delicious.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2015,3,The hotel was nice but a bit dated,The hotel was nice but a bit dated. It was in a really interesting neighborhood with many embassys. We tried to go to the river or Salle but taxis were very very expensive to Salle so we went to the river and just walked around. I wouldn't necessarily tell people to go to Rabat. Hotel was “fine” but was too far from the center city so we felt too isolated. We had to order room service which was ok but not great.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2015,3,Nice garden setting; room could use a refresh,"We arrived at Villa Mandarine following a long flight from Los Angeles via Paris to Casablanca, so we were very happy to pull up to what looks like a lovely property. The gardens are quite nice; however our room was quite underwhelming with a bed that was on the older side. The bathroom also left a bit to be desired, including bathtub/ shower combo with small glass panel that is meant to keep water in the tub but doesn't. We were only here for one night before heading on to other sights, so it served its purpose. For those who are not used to being around smokers please be advised that there were several in the bar / restaurant area the night we arrived. But we would find that this was the case in most places throughout Morocco.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2015,4,"Very nice place to stay - cosy, quite","We staid here with my family in december. Great place to stay - nice pool, pingpong and ""boules"" game available, as well as a snooker. Very nice rooms and nice staff. It is far from the center of the city, so you'll need a car.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2015,5,It's got it all,"A great hotel in Rabat and relatively near most businesses, but quite secluded; you'll need a car to get around because there are no commercial establishments / restaurants nearby. I was there for a week on a UN Mission and this is where they recommended ... I confirmed it on Travel Adviser and it was as advertised ... Absolutely gorgeous gardens, a real paradise and refuge. Rooms are not large, at least the one I was in, but big enough, well appointed and with all the creature comforts / business necessities one could need. My room had a nice balcony as do most others that I saw. Just an FYI, it's cold this time of year so heating is a necessity as are warm clothes. Nice breakfast (included) and the food was great (I ate dinner there several nights) especially Pastille and…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2014,4,Old World Charm,"I love the attention to detail they put into the place. The attention is very personal as the owners are usually around. The gardens are lovely and well kept, the restaurant is excellent and the wine list very good. I would recommend this hotel to people stopping in Rabat, not only on business.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2015,4,Great place to transition into morrocco,This the perfect place to spend first night in morrocco. We flew into Casablanca. And after a short tour of that city were driven to Rabat and this lovely riad. It could best be described as a small inn. Room open to outside with small patio and enclosed garden. The restaurant was outstanding with the service by the locals best described as charming. The villa is westernized enough for a first night and a good intro into morrocco,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2015,4,Beautiful Hotel with Lovely Gardens,"Only spent one night here and enjoyed our stay. Room had a good size terrace, small sitting area for 2 chairs and table which had fruit when we arrived, nice large entry area for suitcases, and comfortable beds. Beautifully decorated hotel and comfortable. Nice restaurant with very helpful staff.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2015,5,An oasis in the heart of Rabat,"We arrived at the Villa after a tiring flight and found a welcoming environment, friendly staff and lovely room. But the real key is the setting: beautiful, lush gardens surround you and you can find any one of a number of secluded spots to simply admire the foliage, collect your thoughts, read, swim, relax. The dining room is both indoors and outdoors and the menu is excellent, the food well-prepared and the staff helpful. Definitely a hotel to return to.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2015,4,Peaceful Accommodation,"After a hectic day of travel it was a delight to arrive at the Villa Mandarine.We arrived at the Villa Mandarine which was a drive through a lovely garden to a complex of terracotta Moroccan style buildings. The villa itself was so peaceful and calm and our welcome was genuine. We were shown to our room which was beautifully appointed with everything we needed and a lovely view to the garden. We strolled through the garden to look at the pool but didn't see the peacock supposedly roaming the grounds......but we did hear it later on. We changed for dinner and headed for the bar. And with G&T and a wine in hand, we sat on the patio and enjoyed the coolness beneath a moon tree! Our next move was dinner, in the same area, which turned out to be disappointing for me, but no…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2015,3,Beautiful but....,"When we first got there, we were very impressed by the room and the grounds- they are beautiful.However, French is the language spoken by most of the staff so communicating in English was a challenge except at the front desk. The wait staff at breakfast was in no hurry to offer coffee and we were the only ones there at the time.At one we called down to the desk and then after 2 hours went down to get more toilet paper- we were assured it was coming both times—but it never did. So if you are French speaking and don’t need toilet paper (or, I assume, much else) it’s pretty.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2014,4,"Very nice small, boutique hotel in Rabat","Villa Mandarine is most renown for its setting: a small riad in the middle of a gorgeous orchard, where peacocks roam free. The rooms are nice, but try and get one with a balcony. The service is impeccable and the restaurant is outstanding, if a bit pricey. Breakfast is usually included and provides a nice spread. Best of all is a drink in the garden in the summer, or a few beers while playing pool. VM is ideally located if you need to do business in Hay Riad. Taxis are hard to come by but the reception will gladly call one for you. All in all, a magical place.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2015,5,Paradise with Orange trees and Peacocks,"I had a privilege to stay several times at Villa Mandarine. Every time it was fantastic experience. You have a real villa transferred into a hotel by a family of French owners, who are there most of their time to control the quality. Rooms are very simple, decorated in traditional colours, very comfortable sleeping. Calm and quiet. Some have balcony with garden view. Swimming pool is available during summer season. Restaurant is excellent for long breakfast on the terrasse. Also good for a business lunch if you need a quiet place to invite somebody and discuss things. The only issue is location - tourists who want to walk straight fron the hotel could be disappointed - wherever you go you need a taxi, renat a car or driver. For me it was not an issue as I came with my car. …",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2015,5,Excellent accommodation in garden setting with fine dining,"Riad located in beautiful garden setting, comfortable spacious rooms some with balcony overlooking well kept garden.

 July 2015,5,"Relaxing oasis, perfect start to Morocco trip","Our family of 4 arrived at Villa Mandarine after a long journey to Rabat; we were very happy to have a place to relax comfortably. We were shown to two rooms across the hall from each other, both with balconies overlooking the lovely garden. then the porter returned to open a lovely, cool sitting room connecting the two rooms! the beds were luxurious, bathroom large and well outfitted. We enjoyed massages at the spa (Very reasonable); and some time at the pool. When we called down for a dinner reservation, they said we could come at any time. We had a lovely Morrocan dinner on the patio, adjacent to the garden. Breakfast the next morning, in the same place, was even better. Wish we could have stayed another day-- its a drive into the city of Rabat, but worth it for this oasis.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2015,5,A lush riad just outside of the city of Rabat,"Villa Mandarine is located in a residential neighborhood of Rabat, about a 10-15 minute cab ride into the city. The Villa is beautifully appointed, with rooms surrounding magnificent gardens, and even a peacock strutting around. There's a small, but perfectly lovely pool, which is essential if you are traveling in Morocco in the summer. The restaurant offers a wide variety of dishes and the service is very good. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, with patios opening into the gardens and private lounge chairs for each room. The bathrooms are modern. Breakfast included both classic Moroccan dishes, as well as some Western choices. And to our surprise, a chicken jumped onto the empty table next to us. Ask for Moroccan pancakes - they were the best we had. Don't let the…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2015,5,A remarkable oasis,"This is a beautiful property with lovely gardens, literally an oasis from the hustle-bustle of downtown. We stayed in the family suite, which is a good deal because for only a little extra you get two rooms, a common living room, and balconies over the garden. The only drawback is that it is very far from the center of Rabat, being located in the diplomatic area. So unless you have your own car, it is quite a trek to get to any tourist sights. In our case, we had stayed in the medina at the start of our trip; we wanted to stay in a nice hotel our last night before going to the airport, so the distance did not matter.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2014,5,Wake me if I'm dreaming,"The first night in Morrocco after our flight from New York. How can anything be more beautiful than the Villa Mandarine. Situated in an orange grove and garden, this former estate has been impeccably transformed into a must stay hotel. Our room and huge bath were exquisite. The bar fun with gracious service, and the lavish breakfast buffet a gourmet delight. Do not miss their homemade ginger yogurt. We went swimming this first night . . . Fun . . . But unheated! We made up for this by warming ourselves at the bar. We loved everyone about this lovely spot.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2015,1,Lonely Bed & Breakfast,"We were disappointed with this hotel. Maybe our expectations were a little high with such good reviews. Service was non existent, the room was poorly decorated, and the hotel was so empty it felt lifeless. I would not come back and would not recommend it to any of my friends or family.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2015,4,A slice of paradise,"With its peace, tranquility and spacious rooms with gorgeous decor, you feel like you've truly gotten away at Villa Mandarine. A small but adequate pool, fully equipped spa and turn down servi complete the experience of feels-like-home luxury.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2015,5,"Very different, a blend of cultures and they got it just right","I arrived late in the evening, hot and sweaty and very tired, but the Villa Mandarine requires no effort, the check in was simple and quick the room was cool and welcoming the bed was underneath me when I fell back. Room service was quick and the menu selection was adequate for my needs, though the salt and pepper never materialised. However the food as very tasty, just what the weary traveller needs. Give yourself a treat and let the Villa Mandarine look after you next time you are in Rabat, you won't be disappointed.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2015,4,"Nice hotel, with very good food, lacks charm of some other hotels in Morocco.","The Villa Mandarine was the first hotel I stayed at on two week tour of Morocco. Upon check in, I was struck by the coldness of the welcome - no greeting, no welcome drink, no explanation of the hotel's layout or amenities, just an abrupt demand for a passport and a direction to my room. This might be the norm in a chain hotel in the US, but proved to be the exception in Morocco, where we were routinely welcome with welcome drinks, cold towels, and helpful orientations. Upon being shown to my room, I found it colorful and spacious, with a reasonably comfortable bed, good A/C, and a nice balcony looking out on flowering shrubs and trees. When I posted a picture of my room on FB, however, one of my friend's said that it looked like a Best Western from the Southwestern United…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2015,5,Beautiful Overnight Hotel,The Villa Mandarine is a beautiful property for an overnight stay at in Rabat. It is built around huge gardens .... very quiet .... very peaceful. It is a low rise 2 story property. The room and bath are good size. The feel of the place is very French and so are a lot of the guests. We had an excellent meal and breakfast at their restaurant. I highly recommend this property.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2015,5,Enchanting,"I stayed in this hotel last night, and decided to write a review while the place is still fresh in my mind. Villa Mandarine is set in a beautiful location, surrounded by lush gardens, detailed mosaics, and a blend of Mediterranean and Moorish architecture. The vivid colors and exotic fragrances immediately make you feel like you're in another world. The individual rooms are neat and tastefully designed, each with private backyards and expansive bathrooms (as well as a separate toilet and added urinal). The beautifully detailed decor centers on a mosaic fountain with rich surrounding greenery, as well as extensive flower gardens, a pool, and an open terrace. The good food combined with the relaxing and authentic atmosphere set this hotel apart from the rest. Many diplomats,…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 April 2015,4,Lovely Boutique in the Diplomatic District,"This boutique hotel is situated in the ambassadorial district of Rabat. It is expertly run, sophisticated and quite comfortable with a savvy crowd. Yet it is charming...the rooms and public spaces are decorated with artist's copies and unique Moroccan themes. The food is expertly prepared in the restaurant and the service impeccable. The front desk is singularly efficient and was responsible for providing us with driver and tour service that enhanced our Moroccan vacation by steering us to Fes, Meknes and Volubilis, on our way to Chefchaouen. I completely recommend this wonderful hotel to any travelers to Rabat...a venue that we found to be well worth the stop and a highltight to any tour of Morocco. Lastly, I would have give five glowing stars but for the overwhelming…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

Comfy beds and high quality linen. 4. Great restaurant for meals. Good selection for breakfast. Homemade yogurt and jam, omelette, etc. 5. Good size swimming pool. Cons, 1. Far from downtown. Could be a pro also. Dependent on what you are looking for.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Perfect Introduction to Moroccan Hospitality,"We spent the first night of our two-week Moroccan holiday in Room #1 at the Villa Mandarine, and found it absolutely charming. The room was spacious and cheerful and private, with a lovely little terrace, excellent bathroom and comfy bed. The room was great -- but the building itself and the surrounding grounds make exploring a real pleasure. There's a bar, a restaurant, a variety of lounges with fireplaces and sofas, tiled staircases, antiques and artwork, lush gardens with fruit trees and flowers, a pool . . . who could want for more? We wished we could have stayed longer. The food was excellent, as well, and this hotel made for a perfect introduction to what would be a series of lovely hotels and riads during our visit to Morocco. If there is a single drawback (for…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2015,4,Beautiful hotel in a quiet location,"We had one night in Rabat and after a full day of touring this hotel was perfect. Beautifully decorated, our room was bright blue and white with a connecting door to my sisters, warm tangerine room. Both rooms had a private patio overlooking the wonderful gardens. To top it all the restaurant at the hotel was 5 star! We had one of the best Moroccan meals here at a reasonable price.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Beautiful quiet place,"We had one night in Rabat and are glad that we spent it at Villa Mandarine. It is very quiet, the room was spacious and comfortable, and everything was clean. We had a ground level room so could enjoy the view of the garden as well as a stroll in it. Both the room and the garden were clearly handled with care by the owners in designing them and the staff in maintaining them. The breakfast was very good. The location in the embassy district was fine for us as we had very limited time here, with an evening arrival and departure the next morning, but otherwise might be a drawback. But if you want a beautiful and peaceful introduction to Morocco, you could not do better than Villa Mandarine.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2015,4,Only just Very Good,"We have stayed at this establishment before - so we were return guests.That could not be said for many of the others - they were upscale tourists stopping over for a night in the Rabat area, as well as the occasional small party of business men. To start with: the Reception area, and attention there: they are agreeable, but pretty hopeless - on the phone, on the email, and even face to face; but everything gets sorted out eventually. And they are a good reference point for a car, a taxi, a restaurant, etc. Meals/restaurant: it is just a little bit better than OK. It could be better. Breakfast, which is included in the room rate (which is in itself substantial) is hardly 'Fine' - it is mediocre, but sort of adequate. Lunch - either in the restaurant, on the terrace, or outside…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2015,5,Excellent choice for Rabat,"We spent 1 nights at the Villa Mandarine in Rabat as part of a twelve day tour of Morocco. The room was excellent: spacious, light and well furnished. The hotel is set in quiet grounds and provided an excellent night’s sleep. WiFi is available and was good. The restaurant serves good food at a reasonable price. The only negative is that breakfast was slow to get moving and the full buffet selection was not available until a good 20 minutes after the scheduled start time. Overall, would definitely recommend.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2015,5,a refreshing surprise,"This is a property which is obviously cared about by its family of owners. Let's start with the gardens.... Just amazing, having been a former citrus orchard it's still full of beautiful fruit. I was able to just pick up a fallen grapefruit, peel it and enjoy its delicious juiciness. Someone loves this garden; it's also planted with flowers and flowering trees which release their fragrance at night. The angels' trumpets are a sea of apricot beauty. The room was spotless, absolutely fresh and sparkling. The net drapes were a delight (yes, I smell hotel curtains; it's a great indication of cleanliness).Try it sometime; you'll be surprised but not always pleasantly. I agree with some reviewers that the rooms have an 80's feel but they are spacious and beautifully maintained. The…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2015,4,Magical and exotic hotel for an amazing stay!,"I stayed for one night at Villa Mandarine with my mum. It was simply amazing! The hotel is well decorated and mixes Moroccan and Mediterannean. You could feel in South of France then you see a Moroccan living room at the corner that reminds you that you are in Rabat! We have requested a late checkout and we got it! We had an amazing breakfast buffet in the morning. Rooms are spacious and well maintained. Although the hotel is far away from the tourist trail we got easily to the centre. We also requested the reception to call a taxi for us. Overall, very good!! No wonder why it's a TripAdvisor travellers choice for 2015.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2015,5,Beautiful surprise in wonderful Rabat,"This place was such a wonderful surprise. After flying into Casablanca, we wanted to be on our way, so we went directly to Rabat for 2 nights here. It was lovely! The rooms (we had a suite, but the bedroom was the same as a standard room) were comfortable, the staff was friendly and efficient and the common rooms and garden spaces were beautiful - with warm fires in the fireplace, great food and wine in the bar, and a lovely restaurant.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat

 January 2015,5,Quality art and gardens,The orange groves have turned into beautiful gardens. Room#5 is comfortable with a king bed. Service was excellent. Many of the rooms surround an internal courtyard filled with greenery. The hotel owner was an art professor and the entire complex is full of both original and high quality copies of the work of great artists. We slept under a Picasso. Dali and di Vinci were also present as well as other less familiar artists.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2014,5,"Clean, beautiful gardens and comfy beds",I LOVE that every hotel we stayed at in Morocco had a separte room with door for the toilet! Delicious breakfast and comfortable beds. Nice decor. I wish I had more time to walk around the beautiful gardens.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2014,4,Comfort in Rabat,"Delightful hotel with beautiful grounds and friendly service. It's colorful and comfortable in a quiet, lush setting. We enjoyed strolling the grounds and photographing the wide variety of flowers. It smelled heavenly. Our rooms were spotless and the beds were comfortable.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2014,5,Welcome to Morocco!,"This hotel was our first stop on a two week tour of Morocco - an outstanding place to rest and regroup after a LONG flight with stops in Minneapolis and Paris!. Everything was spotless; food appetizing and easily accepted by the ""western"" palate. Navigating the many internal hallways took a little practice - one could imagine secret doors and passageways. The surrounding gardens were lush and well kept. Understandably, this seemed a popular choice for business travelers to Rabat.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2014,4,Consistent quality over the years,"We have stayed here several times often in the winter and when it is raining. Not the best time to enjoy the lovely gardens but we keep coming back! The courtyard of rooms is removed from the main desk area but that makes it quiet. The rooms have a comfortable decor - somewhat Moroccan but with a yellow and white checked international flair. Sounds weird but works. Internet does not set any speed records so don't plan heavy business communication. And the restaraunt, bar and breakfast are all worth a visit.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2014,5,Wonderful place to stay in Rabat,Very nice boutique hotel. Located in a residential aerea of Rabat. The hotel is surrounded by citrus trees and beautiful gardens. The hotel decor is very pretty.breakfast is very good. It is located away from center town.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2014,5,A Gorgeous Oasis,"We spent several nights in this beautiful hotel. It has an intimate private villa feel to it without being claustrophobic. Wonderful grounds and gardens, gorgeous decor and art work. The restaurant was outstanding. As non smokers we much appreciated the large non-smoking section. The food was superb French cuisine complete with dessert soufflés. Our room was large and beautiful with a great balcony. The staff are friendly and helpful. Lovely pool area. The area is very quiet, settled amongst embassy villas. It was a treat.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2014,5,Unique experience,"I stayed 8 months in Villa Mandarine (July 2013-March 2014) while I was waiting to move to another country. The team helped us to feel like home during this long period. Rooms are really beautiful with a Moroccan touch that makes the difference. We tried different rooms, different floors and I can guarantee that all the rooms are different, have different touch but they are all beautiful. The hotel is really quiet and located in a really quite neighborhood. Villa Mandarine is also a cool place to chill. The bar and the restaurant are really nice. The yard is so beautiful, orange trees, beautiful flowers, peacoks! I really recommend this hotel and I am sure you will have no regrets!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2014,5,An excellent place to chill and stay,"Villa Mandarine is an excellent place to chill and stay - I only had two nights here but I intend to return for an extended holiday. The atmosphere of the Villa is quite exceptional. The room (30) included absolutely everything one would need to be comfortable. I am usually able to note the 'little things' missing in a standard chain hotel but that was the beauty of this place - nothing was missing !!! Power points are often difficult to locate or involve removing a bed-light socket, but at Villa Mandarine they even placed three sockets in a box on the desk - WOW !! The owners really know every little item that a person needs to be comfortable. The food is fabulous and the service first class. I will return !! A heartfelt thank you for your thoughtfulness!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2014,3,Basic lack of skills and/or training led to very unsatisfactory stay,"Basic lack of skills and/or training of middle management in this hotel led to a very unsatisfactory stay. After a long day travelling and sightseeing we arrived hot, tired and dusty at the Villa Mandarin in Rabat, only to find that the hotel had incorrectly reserved only one, rather than two, bedrooms for our party of two couples and the rather unpleasant 'reception manager' seemed more interested in 'prooving' it was not his fault (the hotel manager later admitted that it was) than in resolving the probem. We were told there were no bedrooms available and there was talk of one couple having to go to another hotel. My husband phoned booking.com, through which we had reserved the hotel, and their response was immediate and very, very efficient. They phoned the hotel and within…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2014,4,Nice quiet stay,"Spent a night here while traveling Morocco. The facility is wonderful, an old villa restored to a hotel. Sitting on our patio and looking at the gardens was delightful. The room was fine, no complaints. Breakfast was very good and included. Service was very good,a place we would stay again should we end in Rabat. The location is maybe not the best, a long ways from any shopping or anything of interest. As we did not need to go shopping and were seeing sights and had a driver it was no problem. Check in and out was easy and there is a small elevator should one be needed. A nice place but after Riad Kniza.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2014,5,Garden of delights!,"Only got to stay one night, and was very sad not to spend more time in the magnificent gardens surrounding the hotel. The rooms were lovely and the service excellent. Our room had it's own patio, perfect for sipping very good morning coffee. The breakfast buffet was fine and our dinner excellent. would return for a longer stay next time.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2014,3,Pleasant stay but could do with a facelift,"We stayed one night at Villa Mandarine and found the hotel to be very pleasant with good service, an excellent dinner and an adequate breakfast. It was also lovely to get away from city chaos and be surrounded by beautiful gardens (unfortunately we did not have time to use the pool or spend time in the garden). We did however find the hotel to be very tired in its decor, fixtures and fittings. Although spotlessly clean and spacious, the rooms are 70's style which gives it more of a 3 star feel. Our room on the ground floor had a lovely private patio/garden. If you want to be away from the chaos of the city with some peaceful respite and don't mind it's slightly remote location then this is the place for you. If you are looking for 5 star decor and amenities then this is not the…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2014,5,Home away from home,"Nested in the quiet diplomatic area of Rabat, once you cross the gate, you feel like you are in a ""peaceful haven"". Walking around the garden at night after dinner is like a walk in paradise. The orange smell is strong enough to send you to the 7th haven. I hope one day, I will have a miniature garden like the one in Villa Mandarine.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2014,5,Lovely Hotel,"Really lovely hotel with great use of colours and space in the rooms and public reception areas. We ate in the hotel restaurant for both lunch and dinner and the food was excellent on all occasions. The service at dinner on out first night was a little slow but I think they just had fewer staff on duty, but we were in no rush so just enjoyed the ambiance. It was a buffet breakfast that was absolutely fine with some of the usual suspects like boiled eggs, toast, cereal, fruit, etc. The location of this hotel does mean that you have to get a taxi into Rabat. We had to wait a while for this (nearly 50 mins) but it was a Monday morning so it could have busy with business traffic. Used the pool area a couple of times which was a very welcome break and you get towels and bathrobes…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2014,4,Quiet,"We enjoyed our stay at Villa Mandarine. It's in the quiet diplomatic area of Rabat, so you need a way of getting into the main tourist areas in the centre. It's too far to walk. Our room was comfortable - on the first floor around the central courtyard with it's palm trees, The gardens are fabulous with lots of lovely flowers and fruit trees. The food is also good. The Villa appears to have grown like topsy with a corridor linking the main bedroom areas with the main public areas. There's a slightly 70s feel to the new areas with the coloured roof tiles on the corridor adding to that feel. This combined with the quiet overall feel (which we liked) gives a slightly sad air. Overall we liked it and would stay there again.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2014,4,Very pleasant,"We spent a very pleasant evening at this hotel in Rabat. The staff were pleasant and our room was clean, spacious and comfortable. We ate dinner there too. It was very nice to feel safe after three nights in questionable riads.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2014,4,Dreamlike experience at a beautiful place,"Villa Mandarine was so beautiful, it felt as if you were in a private home, but with the convenience of a hotel. The idea that a family runs this place added to the great charm. The gardens were gorgeous, and just walking the property was a pleasure. The dining room and outdoor terraces were lovely. Our room had every possible thoughtful convenience. We had a little terrace off of our room, as well as a lovely split bath, which is of course highly convenient. This is a place you would want to linger, but we could not. We did not anticipate how lovely this would be. The sheets and towels were even monogrammed!! We had a driver, so I do not know about how easy it is to get to the sights of Rabat. If you want a magical experience in a low-key and charming way, this is the…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2014,4,Lovely visit,"Stayed here twice in our 2 week visit and really enjoyed our stay. More of a family hotel, pretty pool, excellent restaurant. Good service at the front desk. Very accommodating. We had a dinner party for 10 people and the service was excellent and the food was great!! We had drinks in their bar and were fascinated by the zebra skin hanging on the wall reminding us that yes, we were in Africa!!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2014,5,A beautiful oasis after a long flight and a hot day,"Villa Mandarine was our first stop on a tour of Morocco and came after a 24 hour trip from Melbourne. It was a great introduction to Morocco and a lovely place to get over our jet lag. Staff were very pleasant, our outdoor breakfast was a delight, and our Pamplemousse suite was spacious and colourful with beautiful views over luxuriant gardens. We were sorry we had only one night there.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2014,4,Such a stunning building .. but,"The hotel is such a gem: one of the best Boutique hotels in the capital. It's located in an isolated diplomatic area that is very far from the center - I think it's easy to find a taxi. The building is very beautiful with a gorgeous garden and a deep heated swimming pool where you can spend a day and relax. Our room was very clean and very comfortable with a big bathroom and a lovely terrace with sunbeds. An only downside is the curtains that gives you a feeling are not clean and very old. Our stay in this hotel was very nice, but it was only hampered by the extremely poor breakfast food and service throughout our 1 night stay.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2014,5,Gorgeous hotel,This was a beautifully decorated and lovely place to stay. We booked a standard room which was spacious as was the bathroom. Bathrobes are also supplied. There is a fabulous pool area but unfortunately we only stayed one night and did not have an opportunity to use it.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2014,5,I Love This Place!,"So mysterious, lovely, a beautiful villa turned into a hotel. Unbelievable garden and very Moroccan. Our room was very comfortable with a extra bedroom for our daughter and a spacious bathroom. This is a 5 star hotel but very reasonably priced. The restaurant is also fabulous, excellent food and lovely atmosphere. So many quiet and inviting corners and sitting areas to explore. Loved the pool area. Would love to go back!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2014,4,Amazing gardens and very attractive property,We should we could have stayed at this property longer. The staff and property was amazing. After 20 hours in flight or in an airport being spoiled at the Spa is a must. The staff at the spa even offered to babysit my daughter while my wife and I got wonderful Hamam's (and must have after that long in flight).,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2014,5,Great place to relax,This is a lovely hotel set in beautiful gardens and is a great place to relax. We stayed one night on our way through Rabat and decided we would spend our last two nights in Morocco back at Villa Mandarine to rest and relax. The air in Rabat is much cleaner than Casablanca and the rooms are large and comfortable each with a private courtyard. The pool is well maintained and large enough for some decent exercise and there is also a well equipped gym and spa.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2014,5,An oasis in the middle of the capital,"Wonderful hotel with beautiful grounds and gardens; very pleasant staff and excellent restaurant with friendly, informative chef. Rooms large and comfortable. Staff does everything to please. A great place to stay when visiting the Casablanca area.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Garden of Eden,"We really like this place. We stayed there one week. The villa is set in a garden full of the most luxurious plants, both comestible and not. Everyday we walked the property and picked deliciously ripe kumquats right from the trees. Every morning at breakfast (which we had in own small shaded garden with hibiscus and bougainvillaeas), we drank fresh squeezed juices from the orange and grapefruit trees in the garden. We were there when the jacarandas where is bloom. What a sight that was! The staff was very pleasant and the whole place really felt like home away from home.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Wonderful.,"This was a lovely hotel with beautiful grounds. We had two nights in a spacious room, with a huge bathroom. There was wonderful tile everywhere, and the room was quite appealing, with its patio and lush vegetation. It was spotless space, with a reasonably comfortable bed. We hated to leave for our next city. The public spaces (rooms, patios, gardens) made us feel as though we were visiting a large private estate. The only negative (which is the trade-off for the gardens and grounds) was that we were a good ways from Rabat city-center so all destinations required taxi or other means of transport. There was good food in the restaurant, and a substantial breakfast was offered….one of the best that we had in Morocco.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Beautiful but...,My main worry about this hotel is its location and that is not the Villa's fault but that of my travel agent. I did not realize that the Villa is in effect isolated from Rabat and one could not walk into the city centre. That said all other aspects of the Villa were just about faultless. The rooms were very good and my wife says the swimming pool was a delight. The cuisine is top rate and its harira soup and seafood pastille were the best by far we had in Morocco. It's a great relaxing place with luxury everywhere but it is not located for touring Rabat on foot by oneselves.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2014,4,Good place to stay in Rabat for starting one's journey in Morocco,"This was an excellent choice of accommodation for the start of a 2-week journey around Morocco and an introduction to Moroccan lifestyle. The villa is beautifully decorated in a traditional style. Our room was on the upper level with a lovely balcony that faces the west. From our balcony, we had a lovely view of the olive trees in the back garden and the sunset. The food was excellent but a little pricey (although the lamb steak they served us on our last night was tough and bland). I would highly recommend the chicken pastilla. Their restaurant appears to be a popular meeting place of politicians and businessmen. The citrus garden is lovely with a few peacocks roaming about. This place is situated at the outskirts of the city in a residential neighbourhood. At first, I had…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Well appointed and comfortable property in Rabat.,"This was the first property my wife and I stayed at during our recent two week visit to Morocco; We stayed at Villa Mandarine for two nights. This is a gorgeous property in the suburbs of Rabat with a friendly and helpful staff. We had a ground level room which had a private terrace and a chaise lounge in a small garden surrounded by flowers and shrubs. The rooms were very clean and include a safe and mini bar. The room key came attached to a cute leather slipper. To enter the property an iron gate is opened and there is a short drive to the lobby area. After checking in the porter escorted us to our room. We were provided with complimentary water, cookies and a lemonade type of drink. I should note that during our stay in Morocco, this was the only property that provided…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2014,5,beautiful property,"Perfect choice in the suburbs near all the embassies. It was quiet and had the best of everything. Top notch! Nicest breakfast in morocco, Lovely gardens all around and a very quiet clean pool to end the day at.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Can't wait to stay here.,I went here for dinner after a hard day of work. How wonderful this place is. My next stay in Morocco will be here if there are rooms available. The smell of the gardens will make you smile. Food was wonderful and the service was great.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Fantastic Restaurant/Hotel,"FELLOW AMERICANS, THIS IS THE PLACE The chef treated us to a 5 Star, 5 course meal that was incredible and actually for the quality, very reasonable. The wait staff were very attentive and helpful. The ambiance with the outside garden seating (and what an amazing garden) was perfect. and this is not a one off. I have stayed here several times and the food, service, and beauty remains consistently top notch. The only downer I have is the digital weight scale in the room..... with food, wine, ambiance this great, that thing ought to be against the rules!!!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2014,4,The Scent of Orange Blossoms,"We started our 15 day tour here.... when we exited our car the scent of orange blossoms was amazing. The grounds are beautifully kept, a beautiful pool, lovely bar and restaurant. We had a great room with a private patio. Both dinner and breakfast were delightful and was the perfect place to rest up from the day of travel. Rooms were very nice, clean and well maintained. Staff were friendly and delightful.... but I still remember the amazing perfume of the orange blossoms.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2014,5,Top in Rabat,"We started our two-week travels in Rabat rather than Casablanca, given availability of international flights and a much less hectic arrival scene in a small easy-to-navigate airport. Villa Rabat is a beautiful home turned into a hotel, surrounded by a garden, pool, and 700 citrus trees. Just walking around the garden on a beautiful spring day like today and you cannot help but be relaxed. Rooms and public areas are filled with unique Moroccan artwork. Rooms are reasonably spacious and well-maintained, with separate toilet and bath areas, TV with international cable (some English language), and 24 hour free wireless internet. In addition to an upscale restaurant, room service is provided. An afternoon cracker/cookie snack is delivered in the afternoon. The property has full spa…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2014,5,Lovely. One of the best things about Rabat,"A garden villa. Beautiful grounds. Nice room with semi-private patio. We stayed here on a tour. We had one meal here, which was excellent. This is not in the downtown area (thank heavens), but out in a nice neighborhood (Souissi) of villas and embassies. If you have some urge to go downtown, you can get a cab. It's not especially close but not impossibly far. I took the tour bus so I can't comment on the cost. If I had to go back to Rabat, I would immediately relish the prospect of staying here. And eating here.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2014,4,A perfectly different type of stay.,"No chain hotel here. Mid April and the weather was perfect, citrus blossom in full scent and hotel just the right type of interesting and relaxing. It honestly felt a bit dreamy and just right - stayed for business will stay again for vacation.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2014,4,The bigger they are...,"We booked at this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. It's absolutely gorgeous. Let's be clear, though. It is VERY far from town. In non-rush hour, 30 minutes. The taxis don't want to come out because they can't pick up a return fare. Most of the staff was very nice, but the desk manager was absolutely snarky. Perhaps he's jaded by the wealthy and rude clientele, but he was a jerk on two occasions. Hey fella, Villa Mandarine didn't get to the top of the heap on account of you, but on account of you, it can decline easily. We won't go back. I'm still calling it very good, because if a remote location and rude check in and out fit your needs, this place is perfect in every other regard. And everyone else was lovely.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2014,5,Ideal setting for a relaxing break,"We were looking for a relaxing break and some winter sun after the relentless rain in the UK. We could not have chosen better. Villa Mandarine is a peaceful, sophisticated retreat from the bustle of central Rabat. Located in the prestigious diplomatic area, it is a short taxi ride to the Kasbah, Necropolis, souk etc. and the petits taxis are cheap and readily available, if sometimes a little ramshackle. The gardens, a former orange grove, are a delight - the orange blossom was just starting to emerge,, when we were there, giving off its wonderful, heady scent. In April and may the perfume must be intoxicating. The décor, a mixture of European and Moroccan with a wide range of reproduction art, is welcoming and interesting. There are log fires and candles in the public…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2014,4,Perfect place to transition after a long flight,"Villa Mandarine is an excellent place to wind-down and transition after an overseas fight. Its neighborhood is made up of ambassadors' residences and beautiful estates, and the hotel is in the middle of a lovely citrus orchid. The cocoon-like atmosphere envelopes you immediately, and the lush landscaping and aromas are incredibly relaxing after a long day of travel. We only had one day at Villa Mandarine before going on to Fes, yet both my husband and I said, ""Why would anywhere stay anywhere else?"" My first experience at a hammam was extraordinary - I had no idea I had so many layers of dispensable skin! The Villa Mandarine hammam was very reasonably priced considering it eliminated my jet lag and a hangover, and made my skin absolutely glow. The restaurant was…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2013,5,Simply Elegant,"We arrived at this beautiful property in the dark just in time to have a delicious dinner in the restaurant. My chicken tangine was delicious! The atmosphere in the dining room was just elegant! Our room on the 2nd floor was spacious, furnished beautifully and had all the amenities! I rose early in the a.m. to take a swim in the pool (even in the light rain) and it was very refreshing. We walked the gardens after a very generous and delicious breakfast in the dining room. When we left the villa, we saw where we were and the area was just lovely. It was a little ride into Rabat. It is definitely a hotel where you would want to spend more time.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2013,5,Too short of a stay,"We came for one night in Rabat, and unfortunately we were delayed and did not arrive till 9pm. The room was very nice and the grounds were exceptional. We had a light dinner in the bar and enjoyed lox sandwiches and frys. Our room had its own small patio and lounge area. If you come here, try to arrive early enough to enjoy the grounds and the pool. Breakfast was very good as we'll.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2013,5,Hidden delight among the embassies,"Our only regret was that we were in this delightful place for only one night. However we were fortunate enough to arrive at lunch time, so had a whole afternoon to enjoy the lovely gardens and excellent pool. There is nothing we can fault from the well appointed, large room, good wifi, delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner to the greeting from the owner who spoke to us at our table at dinner. She was born on this property which was owned by her family and decided, when her husband retired to convert it a hotel. The food was exceptional, a mix of French and Moroccan. There were delights around every corner, from the tranquil courtyard with its fountain to the antique filled reception rooms, to the occasional garden sculpture. It seems this is a one night stop for many guests.…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2013,5,Beautiful and comfortable place to stay in Rabat,"We spent one night at Villa Mandarine and would have loved to stay there longer. Our room has an adjoining garden area and was large. The sheets were exquisite. The property itself is incredibly beautiful and peaceful. The wifi signal was very strong. Our breakfast was also very good. Overall, a terrific place to stay and relax.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2013,5,"Beautiful Hotel, as nice as described in other reviews","We also started here, staying for one night after flying into Casablanca. This hotel is lovely, immaculate, intimate, and we wished that we could have stayed here longer. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood, and the breakfast was one of the best that we had in Morocco. We would have been happy spending a long weekend in this hotel, even if it were located in the US. Would definitely stay here again.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Garden of Eden!,"Wonderful gardens. Pool. Full breakfast included. Their cheese omelette was the best I've ever had. Out of Rabat about 10 minutes but wonderful room. This was our first stop after a long flight from the USA, Lisbon and onto Casablanca. Very welcoming staff and extraordinary facilities.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Heaven on Earth,We only stayed one night as we had arrived from Paris on our way to Fes. The staff welcomed us graciously. Such tranquility. it was like being in the center of a beautiful bouquet sitting at dinner and breakfast in the garden. It is located outside the center so you escape the city hassle . A must for a visit in Rabat!,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Villa Mandarine Rabat,"We stayed only one night at this beautiful villa after flying into Casablanca Airport from Europe. We were blown away with the beauty and tranquility of this amazing villa. The colours in the garden were incredible and the decor inside the house were incredible. The food was excellent and the service. Couldn't fault it in any way, wish we could have stayed there for a few more days",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2013,5,A little parcel of heaven on earth,"Villa Mandarine is a very cute, beautiful, charming hotel. It's the perfect harmony of nature, Moroccan traditional art and architecture, and modern facilities. The hotel is located in very lush and fertile grounds, surrounded by trees, plants, flowers from everywhere. I believe the property used to be a farm in the past. It always smells nice and you can hear the music of birds singing or water falling in the fountain in the central patio. Everywhere in the hotel is beautifully decorated, either by the owners with unique furniture and piece of arts, or by mother nature with gorgeous flowers and trees. There's a SPA in the hotel, an outdoors pool, Ping-Pong (table-tennis) table, billiard (pool) table, and plenty of corners to explore, and sitting areas to just relax enjoy being…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2013,5,Must stay in Rabat,"The grounds of this hotel are beautiful and tranquil - very lush and colorful. The details of the decor are really stunning and what you would hope for to capture the culture. The room was very comfortable in all ways and had a gorgeous spacious bathroom, as well as a nice sitting area/balcony. The food was also quite good, excellent breakfast buffet and for dinner I recommend the lamb!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2013,2,Beautiful place terrible reception,"We stayed in this beautiful hotel for one night. The room was great as were the grounds and common areas. However, our experience was marred by the very unpleasant and rude person at reception. When we checked in, he was rather cold, and things were worse when we checked out. We settled our bill for dinner upon checkout and left. As we drove out, the guard at the gate told our driver that we had to go back. My husband and our driver went back into reception where we were accused of stealing the bathrobes. We had left them hanging in the bathroom on the hooks. Apparently, the housekeeper never looked there. The rude man barely apologized. A word to the next guests... Throw your robes on the floor and be prepared to not feel welcome and to be treated poorly. For the price of the…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2013,5,Great stay -- beautifully furnished -- very hospitable,"If travel takes you to Rabat area of Morocco, I cannot imagine a better hotel. The rooms were well appointed, the hotel quiet overall, and the staff very helpful. We arrived in the late evening and they made it easy for us to get relaxed. The breakfast buffet was excellent and they also made eggs upon request. We loved the center courtyard and orange trees. Such a nice hotel -- it was a surprise to us how wonderful it is.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2012,5,a favorite,"We stayed at the Villa Mandarine for over 3 weeks during a move to Morocco. The best thing about arriving at dusk was the beautiful scent of orange blossom and the romantic lighting. The decor is understated but very Moroccan. The gardens are lovely for strolling and the breakfast bar serves marmalades and jam made from the orchard fruits (the homemade yogurt at breakfast is amazing too). The rooms are peaceful and clean with unique touches in each. The pool can be a bit cold but is very nicely situated. The restaurant menu is top-notch, very yummy international and Moroccan cuisine (Fish tajine is a favorite). The staff were attentive and kind, especially to our 2 year old who, after 3 weeks, had the run of the place. We always take guests back for meals now that we…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2013,4,The Best Oranges in the World!,We stayed at Villa Mandarine while on honeymoon only for a night. It was more of a travel break for us. The hotel was small and cosy. It was a good stay but slightly expensive. The best part is their orange orchard - they have the best oranges in the world. We had not eaten such good oranges. Best was you could walk around and pluck out as many as you wanted. The best ones are ofcourse served in your room and at the breakfast table. Still remember the taste of the oranges!,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 January 2013,5,a great pleasure to all the senses...,"Beautiful gardens, helpful staff and amazing food.....these are just introductory remarks, villa mandarin is more than that..garden of flowers, birds, butterflies and PEACOCK..kids r amazed to see peacock roaming near their breakfast table. The smell of blooming mandarin flowers worth every breath. Nice pool, elaborated decor..with all famous painting, central garden and , some modern artifacts.restaurant is one of the best in city..just ask what you want..and multilingual staffwill convey it to the Chef. Rooms are so cosy with private balcony. Very helpful staff right from the doorkeeper to the manager...just visit once and make it home",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2013,4,Cold staff in a warm facility,"From a facilities perspective, there's nothing bad to say about the hotel. Rooms are comfortable and spacious. The gardens are lovely and the dining room is attractive. The staff, however, is among the coldest set of people I've ever encountered while traveling. Upon arriving, the reception staff pushed papers at us to fill out without even a hello or welcome (in any language) let alone a smile. The restaurant staff was equally rude. The food however, was very good with a mix of Moroccan or high-end international fare. Pricey for Morocco but not break-the-bank expensive. You're quite a bit from downtown so other dining options are limited in this diplomatic neighborhood. All in all, the stay was fine, but the staff needs a big lesson in civility.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 January 2013,4,Pleasant setting but menu a little disappointing,"I stayed here for a week in late January 2013 whilst on business. I would agree with all the other reviewers that the staff are very friendly and helpful, the grounds are fantastic with numerous exotic trees and shrubs and the rooms are nicely appointed, although a proper walk in shower would have been nice, as opposed to a hand-held shower over the bath. The neighborhood is safe and quiet and is basically in the affluent consular district suburb of Rabat. Although the hotel is 5 or 6 miles outside the centre of the city, you can get reception to call a 'petit taxi', which carries 3 passengers max. for around 350 dirham (£3.00 approx) or a 'grand taxi', which carries up to 5 passengers for about 1000 dirham (£8.00 approx). The breakfast in the hotel is very good with freshly…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2012,5,An oasis,"I had a wonderful stay at the Villa Mandarine, what a pleasant oasis. I would gladly go back for business or pleasure. The food was particularly good - with an excellent restaurant for lunch and dinner. The only drawback is that it is located so far from the center. That said, it's a safe neighborhood where it's pleasant to walk in the evening.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2012,4,Lush Retreat Outside of the City,"The grounds of this hotel are stunningly gorgeous, exactly what a place with the word mandarine in its name should look like. Interior courtyard is very lush and green, does not feel like you are in a hotel at all. We had a nice outdoor patio with our ground floor room, citrus trees all around us. And loved the peacocks walking around in the gardens. As we were soon to experience throughout Morocco, the service was fantastic, we felt very taken care of. We had dinner at the hotel and it was very good. My first real tagine did not disappoint.- I would say only con (a slight con) is that you are in the suburbs of Rabat, so unless you have a car you are confined to the hotel. We were there only 1 night and our guide picked us up the next morning so it was no big deal, but if…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2012,4,For a relaxing weekend,"The hotel, surrounded by gardens and an orange grove, is perfect for a weekend away. The rooms are large, well decorated, and very comfortable. With its spa, fitness room, pool, restaurant and bar, the hotel has everything anyone could need to refresh and relax. The breakfast was very good with cooked to order eggs and a wonderful variety of breads. Lunch and dinner were fine though not outstanding. The only caution I would have about the hotel is the distance from any other Rabat attractions. Without a car, visiting Rabat is time-consuming as the hotel has to call a taxi and the wait may be as long as half an hour. For anyone wanting a respite from the hustle and bustle of normal tourism, the hotel is fantastic and shouldn't be missed.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2012,4,Villa Mandarine - a garden oasis,"Thsi hotel is located in the suburbs of rabat, a very bustling modern city. The hotel rooms are all different and comfortable. The hotel is surrounded by lush landscaped gardens and has beautiful comfortable community areas. The restaurant is overpriced.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2012,3,Very nice,The rooms were very large with lovely private balconies. The property is in a beautiful garden setting with a lovely pool and built around a nice courtyard. We had lunch and breakfast in the restaurant and the food was nice and the service was decent.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2012,3,First stop in a 2 week vacation,"The accommodations are very nice, roomy with nice bathrooms. We had a great view of the jungle like garden. The included breakfast was good. The omelette was not made to order but they had a huge selection of pastry breads. The only reason I have rated this as average is the bar. The red wine was served cold and the bartender spoke absolutely no English. I tried to order Whisky straight up and it came with ice. He never smiled and it wasn't busy. We were offered hot peanuts which were delicious.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2012,3,Upgrade,"Hi - had a few days as this location... generally a great place just like being in the rainforrest or in a lodge in South Africa... however, they need to upgrade some of the facilities: please provide free coffee and tea in the rooms together with 1-2 bottles of water on a complementary basis like all other 4-5 Star hotels... You need to replace a lot of the equipment in the gym... too old and used... not valid anymore.... and lastly: your breakfast is way behind what similar hotels are offering around you in Morocco! actually it is the BIGGEST minus in my experience of this ""great"" place ... you need more options at the table, more green ""stuff"" - take a trip to Kinski in Casablanca and look how they serve a breakfast ... the place is too far from the the center of Rabat....…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2012,5,Would have liked to have stayed longer,"A bit out of town and a world of difference from the riads we stayed in in Fes and Marrakesh. This is comfortable, purpose built hotel and is a luxury many wouldn't want or need. The gardens are what make this special but we didn't really stay long enough to get the benefit of them. Meal in evening was good if on the expensive side but couldn't fault the breakfast which being a buffet style enabled you to tuck in to what you wanted. As long as you like orange you'll like the rooms and decor.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2012,5,Good business hotel,"A bit out of the centre of town, but close to many embassies. The wifi worked well. The rooms are tastefully colourful, and the extensive gardens are beautiful. Recommended? This stupid site won't let me submit if I don't rate the spa - as I did not use it, how can I comment?",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2012,4,Lovely hotel with gardens.,"The hotel and gardens have a relaxing quality, nice for strolling and finding a beautiful place to sit. Our rooms were lovely, dinner at the restaurant was very good, and the peacocks roaming through the flowers were a treat.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2012,4,"Great Romantic Hotel,Good atmosphere, A little expensive","This was a very good hotel to stay at, if you are on a romatic trip. I was travelling for business and I found it less suitable. The room interior is nice with good view (if you're on the ground floor), it has large glasses facing your own private garden. The entrance to the room is nice as well with a small garden and a fountain. If you like nature, green and a quite atmosphere you'll love this. If you're looking for the action this is not the place.There's almost nothing around except for a british pub (more of a restaurant with terrible food) 10 minutes walking distance. Room price was around 220USD per night.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2012,5,Even late hours,We arrived very late due to our bags being delaying in Casablanca. The riad was incredible. They arranged to have dinner to delivered to our rooms with a smile and a warm welcome. The rooms were immaculate and the hotel was absolutely incredible! We were sorry to leave,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2012,5,Luxury and Service,"This is a hotel like no other.All the rooms that our group had were on the ground floor with a private small garden, great for breakfast coffee and and aperitif before dinner. The restaurant is exceptional, with amazing food.Service is very good. We asked about the pool and the desk said ""we will have it prepared and ready is half an hour. It was done. Privately owned and the owners came to bid us farewell. A little on the outskirts in the embassy area. Languages are no problem. The service is personal and very, very good. ' Done",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2012,1,"over-priced, poor service, outside of rabat","This is one of the most expensive hotels we stayed in Morocco and was byfar the worst. To start with, compare to riats that are far more authentic beautiful and have far better service than the villa mandarine, this one is really not worth the price they ask for. Moreover, is dates, everything in the rooms seems worn and tired. The service is poor and the location is way too far from the city center to walk, there is nothing in the vicinity of the hotel. The crowd you will find is expatriats who work in Rabat since the hotel is close to the embassies, who either have been to long in Morocco and don't want to mingle with the locals or as we found out with the ones we had a chance to meet, have total disregard for everything local. If you go to Rabat - find a different place to…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2012,5,High School Reunion,"I have traveled more than 6 months a year all over the world for the past 6 years or so and stay in ""cookie cutter"" hotels where you wake up and can't tell the difference of where you're at or what hotel you're staying in! That changed with Villa Mandarine! Free breakfast with homemade jams, fresh fruit from the trees on the ""estate"" and peacocks wandering by... rooms are huge compared to typical villas. Staff was extremely pleasant and went out of their way to offer us food and drink after the restaurant and bar had closed! It was certainly memorable and the only place I will now stay in Rabat in my travels there!",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2012,5,Outstanding choice...quite close to Sofitel,"In Rabat for a conference at the Sofitel, which was luckily sold out, which led us to find the Villa Mandarine via Trip Advisor. It was delightful. Stayed for three days. Excellent wifi! Grounds gorgeous, very private room with terrace, lovely pool, breakfast yummy (especially the homemade yogurt). Ten minutes via taxi to Sofitel. Villa Mandarine by far the better choice. Charming district, low rise, near many embassies. The very best part was the ""hamman"". While it wasn't the most beautiful spa, the treatment itself was magical. A steam was followed by ""black soap"" and then a wonderful scrub, followed by a good massage and hair washing.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2012,5,Absolutely perfect!,"My wife and I stayed at Villa Mandarine our first night of a three-week tour of Morocco. We had just flown into Casablanca after some ten hours of travel from New York. We were exhausted but also excited. Villa Margine was the absolute best introduction we could have had to Morocco. It had all the comforts that a westerner would need in those circumstances but without losing the sense that, yes, we were in Morocco. It’s a beautiful hotel in a quiet affluent residential area outside the city center. Our room was large and spacious with a very comfortable king sized bed, a large modern bathroom and a small private loggia on the garden. It is built around a beautiful courtyard. Cabled internet in our room worked perfectly. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Dinner…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2012,5,"A lovely, peaceful oasis in Rabat","We stayed at the Villa Mandarine when in Rabat in April, 2012. It is set among all kinds of fruit trees, and all of the rooms wind down many halls and have their own private terrace in or overlooking the numerous gardens. Everything about the villa exceeded our expectations. The grounds, the public outdoor terraces and open courtyards are just beautiful. The entrance drive is charming and beckoning as well. The riad's rooms feature beds as comfortable as 'cocoons,' and each room was supplied with bananas, clementimes and mandarine oranges, homegrown of course, as well as fruit biscotti. Walking into the large lounge with its cozy fireplace seating was very welcoming. On our way to the bar we passed through a room with a pool table which led to the bar and then to their…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2012,1,Ruined marriage anniversary,"Having reserved (10 days ahead of time), the staff informed me that Sundays they do not open the restaurant to people who are not staying in the hotel. Even after explaining that we traveled over 200 Kms for that dinner one in a lifetime first marriage anniversary, the staff, blaming us of course, showed and incredible lack of good manners, and refused us a table !! None of the managers was there so we can explain the situation.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2012,5,A gem of a hotel with a fabulous restaurant.,"We stayed here for a rest from the city stress and noise as we had travelled down for a day visit from Tangiers - what more could you ask for, a delightful hotel, rooms clean and above all the setting of the villa is gorgeous and quiet amongst lovely luxurious gardens, orange trees and peacocks. We dined in the restaurant in the evening, I took the set five course menu which was 500DH and delicious, well worth it. I visited the Spa but did not have the time to try it but looks beautiful. Much more of a family style and personal / quieter, than the Sofitel where we stayed before so if this is what you you are looking for would highly recommend. Personal parking also inside the property which is convenient. Breakfast was also very good and lots of choice, cereals, vienoisseries,…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2012,5,Lovely Small Hotel,"We greatly enjoyed our visit to this hotel. The grounds are lovely to walk around. The service was great and everyone was very helpful. Though after staying in the medinas in Marrakesh, this was less centrally located than we anticipated so we chose to have dinner at the hotel as it was not very easy to get to another area. Dinner however was great, and looked to be a popular spot even among people who were not staying there.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2012,5,An Oasis in Rabat,"We stayed 2 nights in March and found this family run hotel had all the extra little touches. Beautiful gardens with fruit trees, warm pool and peacocks running around. The art work is interesting and there were many nooks and crannies to search through. The spa was wonderful as was the oil massage. Breakfast was good and supper great. It is an oasis on the outskirts of Rabat. Very refreshing to tired travellers. Would love to stay there again. Loved the fluffy yellow towels and bathrobes.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2012,5,Paradise,"Fantastic hotel, beautiful gardens, spacious rooms. Location is somewhat out of the center of Rabat, but a taxi is only $ 3.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2012,5,Little paradise,"You immediately sense that this little jewel is family-run. Everything is first-class and there are lots of lovely little touches. We had a suite overlooking the inside garden with its fountain - you cannot imagine anything more peaceful. The gardens with their peacocks are fabulous. This is the middle of March but the pool was 27 degrees and absolutely delightful. We loved the restaurant: Breakfast is great (order omelets at no extra cost), lunch outside on the sheltered terrace and dinner very good, especially the couscous. If I ever had a nervous breakdown and needed a good rest, this is where I would come to. Very friendly staff too. Travelers considering this hotel must know that it is situated in the residential area of Rabat but quite far from the city center - you could…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 February 2012,5,Lovely setting,"We had a lovely, light warm room with its own little outside space. The gardens are charming with oranges, lemons and kumquats hanging on the trees. The pool was heated so we could swim in February. We had a light Moroccan style lunch, good buffet breakfast and a nice enough dinner. Service was welcoming and I would have been happy to stay for longer. It feels quite French in style which I liked.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2011,5,Oranges at your door step,Arrived late one rainy evening. Staff could have not been nicer making sure that we had something to eat . Room service was fast and good. All of the staff had a smile on thier faces and wanted to make sure we had a pleasant stay. The rooms were lovely with Moroccan inspired furniture and comfortable bed. Public areas made you fewel as if you were staying in someones grand home. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2011,5,wonderful riad in rabat,"We stayed here at the end of November and everything about the villa exceeded my expectations; its grounds, the public outdoor terraces and open courtyard are just as beautiful as others have written before me. Even the entrance drive is charming and beckoning. The riad's rooms feature beds my daughter in law rightly described as 'cocoons' and each is supplied with clementimes, mandarines, homegrown of course and fruit biscotti. From your balcony you may enjoy your breakfast made to order which is included in the rate. ( and which I didnt discover til the last morning)There is artwork, and antiques everywhere you look in this charming inn; I hope to put up pics soon. And although there is a book detailing the history of the original villa in each room, I never had time to read…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2011,5,A wonderful oasis in a big city,"We stayed in this villa for one night. It is a magnificent old villa full of Moroccan art situated in the middle of an orange grove, in a suburb or Rabat. The gardens throughout the property are amazing, full of exotic tropical plants. The rooms are decorated with old Moroccan furniture and beautiful Berber carpets. Our room was spacious and impeccably clean. The bathroom had all amenities necessary to make your stay comfortable. Throughout the villa there are little spaces where you can sit and read, and think. As an added convenience, the hotel has WiFi.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 July 2011,5,First night in Morocco,We were picked up by our driver in Casablanca and taken to Villa Mandarin for our first night in Morocco. How divine it is. The garden is sensational with the peacocks roaming around. We had a beautiful dinner in the restaurant garden. The rooms were fantastic with all the splendour of Morocco. The staff were great and couldnt do enough for us. Just thinking of wandering through that garden wants me to return.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 September 2011,5,"Lovely setting, great service, and also good for business","This hotel has lots of local character, without sacrificing efficiency or comfort. The grounds are lovely, with orange trees and pretty landscaping, and even better, fragrant air especially in the evening. The rooms are clean, spacious, locally decorated, and efficient. The floors are clean tile, the bed comfortable, there's a desk with a little box covering the sockets for electronics, and a good flat screen TV. A large bath has a window. Lovely linens and comfortable bed. The restaurant is also very good; you can sit outside or in, and the service is very good. A most pleasant stay, the kind that makes you wish you had an extra day.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2011,4,An Oasis in Rabat,"Ate here twice, and botht times the emal was amazing. Very well prepared and flavoursome. The grounds were the most amazing part of this place, set amongst a beautiful landscaped gardens, the smells of the flowers and the visual display was amazing. Staff were extremely polite and courteous during the ramadan period we were there and when I return i will stay here definately. The decor is amazing and traditional, not fake. It was really amazing.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2011,5,Relaxing place to stay in Rabat,"We stayed at Villa Mandarine one night in March 2011 during a tour of Morocco. Its a beautiful, relaxing hotel. The breakfast was excellent and we were even greeted with a peacock showing off its feathers in front of our table. There is an lovely pool, and incredible gardens. Dinner was very good. The service at the hotel was superb. The downside (if its important to you which it wasnt to us) is that the hotel is on the outskirts of town.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2011,5,A really lovely and quite place to start your visit to Morocco,"A very charming hotel, with beautiful rooms, good beds and a very nice restaurant. The hotel has several terraces where you can sit and relax, a beautiful garden, a good swimming pool and other recreational facilities, like jeu de boulle and pingpong. It all was in very good condition and they pay a lot of attention keeping it that way. The staff is accurate and helpful, without being to present. The restaurant serves great meals and also a good Moroccan day menu, although they didn't seem to offer it every day. It is located approximately 15 minutes from the city center of Rabat, which makes it a great place to get acquaintend to Morocco and relax.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 March 2011,5,Expensive but nice,"This is an idyllic large house / small hotel set in gorgeous gardens (complete with peacocks) with very well appointed rooms. It is very comfortable, all facilities, nice heated (outdoor) pool, internet in the room (albeit cable), and a wonderful breakfast (try the Moroccon pancakes, and also the home-made jams). It is rather far out of town, and it is not at all cheap, but if you want somewhere really nice to stay, with personality, this is it.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2010,5,Outstanding Riad,The grounds of this Riad are spectacular. Beautiful flowers and interesting sculptures. Our room was elegant and the staff is very helpful and friendly. The wifi and internet work extremely well. Great place to have a glass of wine in the garden and then a nice dinner. We were touring Morocco so transportation was not a problem. I give Villa Mandarine by highest rating. A great place to stay.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2010,4,"Nice, but out of town!","Well maintained, excellent, charming, quiet Riad but the main drawback is that it is about 20 minutes out of town. Not too expensive to get a ""petit taxi"" into the city - but it is a pain! The staff is very courteous and extremely helpful & the free internet in the rooms a real bonus. Rabat is a sleepy, boring town & we are unlikely to return.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 December 2009,5,Great Place to Stay,There were 4 of us in different rooms on a business trip and this was a wonderful place to stay. A little out of the way but great rooms and atmosphere. They had internet service in all the rooms as well.,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2008,4,Amazing Mediterranean cosy place,"After a business day, I can only recommend spending the evening in one of the hidden inner gardens, blessed by the perfume of the flowers and enjoying a nice glass of wine. Service may improve - that's right - but the wonderful atmosphere makes you leave behind those small issues.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 November 2009,2,the food has gotten a lot worst,"As residents of rabat ,we have visted Villa mandarine many times.however the last 2 times the food has been a disaster.Everything was oily and tasted like argan oil.The fish was overcooked and dry.Will not set foot there anymore unless they have a new chef",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2009,5,Beautiful Riad,"Villa Mandarine is an exceedingly beautiful and elegant Riad, with large, beautiful and elegantly furnished rooms. Ours had a small balcony overlooking the lovely garden. The grounds are beautifully planted and there is a lovely heated pool. The breakfast buffet had a large selection of items, and cooked eggs were also available. We had an excellent dinner at the lovely restaurant. However, as our dinner was included in our room rate, we were not allowed to order off the menu, but had only a limited choice of items. Nonetheless, the food was delicious. The Riad did not provide us with bottled water in the room; presumably you could get it from the restaurant. The Riad is outside the city of Rabat, so you need transportation to get to the city.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 June 2009,5,A peaceful and rejuvenating pleasure,"My husband and I took our four year old son to Rabat in June to visit my 21 year old step daughter who was studying Arabic at a university in the city. I had always wanted to visit Morrocco so I jumped at the opportunity to plan a family vacation when we found out my husband's daughter would be there for several weeks.. Granted there are some limitations when you travel with a small child so we had to be very careful about selecting our place to stay. I have to say Villa Mandarine exceeded our expectations. The room was the perfect size for us and my son had his own twin bed in a large vestibule joining the bedroom and bath areas. The food at Villa Mandarine was excellent and their restaurant is well known amongst professional locals, the grounds are beautifully landscaped…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2009,5,Excellent hotel with alot of atmosphere and beautiful gardens...,We stayed here for two nights upon arrival in Morocco. It was a perfect way to ease into the culture after a very long trip. Welcome was very nice and after a short time we were shown to a suite...we had booked Clemantine but ended up in Pamplemousse (a highter priced room but they of course did not charge extra...people in Clemantine stayed longer than expected). What a beautiful room with two seperate areas and everything you could want. Rooms are scattered throughout the grounds and are all very unique with traditional decor...I think any room would be nice and private. Arranged transfer from airport and they were there to meet us and this went smoothly. We enjoyed dinner in the restaurant both nights and found it good and nice service. At night especially the place smells so…,Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2009,4,"Luxe, calme et volupté","The hotel is really very nice, the rooms are big, warm (it was quite chilly outside when we were there), nicely furnished, spacious and the bathroom has everything one might need. Breakfast was very good, a big selection of delicious homemade jams, freshly squeezed orange juice. The only ""bémol"" is the so called gastronomic restaurant, we had two dinners there and both were really very disappointing, overcooked fish and tasteless food, such a shame ! The gardens and patios are marvellous and the general atmosphere is really very pleasant.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2008,5,Beautiful Spot,"A beautiful ryad - actually more like a country home. The rooms are comfortable with all the necessary amenities. Each room has its own priviate garden where you can sit and enjoy a private, relaxing moment. We loved the restaurant. We stayed some 10 days in Morocco, including 5 different ryads/hotels and many restaurants but Mandarine had the best chicken tagine in the entire country! The breakfast was interesting, varied and plentiful. I would recommend this ryad without reservation.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 October 2008,4,Above average,"Our travel agent selected this hotel to cater for our requirements - somewhere nice and relaxing and with a pool. It exceeded our expectations. The villa is set in quite the most beautiful grounds. The smell of the flowers from the garden when we arrived mid evening is one that I will not forget in a long time. Villa Mandarine is in an area of Rabat that houses many of the embassies. A bit like going to Canberra and staying in Red Hill or Forrest. As others have indicated, the taxi system is different, with the petite taxis arriving with up to 30MAD on the meter which you need to pay as well as your component of the journey. The pool area is very nice with a reasonable size (and very deep) pool (at the deep end) . Nice deck chairs for relaxing and there are other chairs…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 August 2008,5,Beautiful setting outside Rabat,"We selected this hotel as we had some trouble finding anything suitable in Rabat, and we did read one worrying review on TA. However we were enchanted. The extensive villa (part Mediterranean style part Moroccan) has about 30 rooms, and is set in quite the most beautiful grounds. This makes al fresco breakfast plus evening dining if you want it (the place is known for its restaurant as much as for accomodation) all but idyllic. The rooms are comfortable, very clean, fully serviced, and more than adequate, though not luxurious, and if anything a tad lacking in storage space. Public spaces are excellent and the whole property has a splendid interior courtyard as well as the exquisite gardens. Staff were exceptionally courteous and helpful (we had arranged a hire car and the…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 April 2007,4,Feels like home,"Although this is not a small hotel, it makes you feel like you were at home. That is, your home includes a large park with a pool and an orange tree grove, large sitting areas in- and outdoor, a dining room with your own chef...The whole place is spotless clean and in perfect condition. The hotel is a bit out of the way so a car or a taxi ride are needed to reach it. The architecture reminds of the 1960s and has only a few morrocan elements on display.",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 January 2006,5,Unparalleled living in Rabat,"I've come back to the Villa Mandarine numerous times since it first opened a few years ago. It is unlike any hotel experience I have ever had: like being in a warm, gracious, elite home (which it once was), but not so small as to feel claustrophobic. The hotel is exquisitely appointed, a real feast for the eyes with Berber rugs and art and color and architectural treats everywhere you look... gardens replete with enough different citrus trees to live up to its name... big rooms with small balconies, lots of light, high-speed DSL connections (free)... very quiet ambiance... and a truly international kitchen whose modern cooking is world-class (the only disappointment is the Moroccan food, which should be better). The Villa's staff are impeccable, with personal service their…",Villa_Mandarine,Rabat
 May 2005,5,"Beautiful garden, great breakfasts, great staff","We started our honeymoon at Villa Mandarine - and it was absolutely the best way to begin married life! The staff are great - we had a lovely welcome from everyone. They arranged car hire, dinner in an excellent restaurant in Rabat - and were generally very helpful. The hotel is beautiful but in a very comfortable relaxed way. The garden is absolutely magnificent and is a fantastic place to sit. The pool was v clean - and practially deserted which we loved! The breakfasts are full of fresh fruit and pastries. We really couldn't recommend this hotel more.
