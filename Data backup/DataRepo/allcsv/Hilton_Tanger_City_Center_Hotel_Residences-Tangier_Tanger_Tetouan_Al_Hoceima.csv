 December 2022,5,Excellent Staff; A Great Stay!,"My son and I were recently at the Hilton Tanger for 5 nights. We had an excellent stay, mainly due to the wonderful staff. We especially appreciated the assistance we received from Sara and from Yassine Al Boulhi. They were both very helpful, polite, and kind, giving us a lot of logistical information about beautiful Tangier and day trips. Their assistance went above and beyond. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We enjoyed their nice cookie holiday assortment. We will stay again if we visit Tangier again soon.

 May 2021,5,Great Location and Service,"Stayed last few days of May, as Morocco was coming out of many of the restrictions in place. With tourism opening up, this was our first hotel on our trip, and as Diamond members we were welcomed as expected. Executive lounge was closed, but we were given vouchers for the Kasbar lounge instead, and the bartender took care of us, during the evening social times and made it extremely pleasant as we wound down from our daytime touring. I felt like we may have been the only Diamond members staying but that is to be expected with tourism so far down. Our morning breakfast was inviting each day, and the staff was always available to help. Front desk, and every staff member generally seemed happy and ready to help us although our needs were pretty low.

The room was excellent. The hotel has an outdoor pool on the 13th floor. There is a very nice restaurant and bar/lounge on the top floor. An extensive breakfast was included. The restaurant staff at breakfast were absolutely outstanding. I would give the whole staff six stars if it was possible.

 October 2022,1,Really disappointed Hilton guest !,"Series of reviews here folks and this is very serious . I‚Äôve never been disappointed in all of my Hilton stays until now. 1) Room. Safety deposit box inside the room wasn‚Äôt working and we had to call it in 5 times and had to call the manager to get it fixed . Finally someone came after 9 hours. 2) Food service, handling and quality. Staff were setting up the food ( including dried fruits and pastries) in their bare hands and not with gloves ! This is outright not acceptable! This is where you get sick !!! 3) unprofessionalism. The staff was taking photos in their Halloween costume with the food , with her back (long hair) hanging around the food and she‚Äôs flipping her long hair around the food!!!

 October 2022,2,Breakfast with a Not So Eggcellent Attitude,"The breakfast experience was not pleasant. Breakfast service started at 6am and we were first ones there at about 6:15am. It was understandable that they were still setting up. However, when I went to the egg station and asked for scrambled eggs, the young lady in hijab (sorry, I didn't get her name) responded that she's only serving over easy eggs. I informed her that I don't like the yolks wet and she begrudgingly said she would break the yolk of the over easy eggs she was already making. Not the best attitude or no sense of customer service. Someone else took over and started taking special requests like omelets. We then saw the same young lady in hijab picked up a loaf of the bread already displayed with her bare hands (no gloves) to be sliced.

That‚Äôs what happened to us at the Hilton. We were there with a tour group from Gate1. I realize there are labor shortages and some only apply because we were a large group, but trust me; these examples below show a lack of focus on client satisfactory. Do yourself a favor and just go somewhere else. Here is the recap of our issues, highs and lows: - breakfast service was spotty, no one came for coffee or offered eggs on our first morning. We found out that it was an option after seeing other patrons. We ordered them on the second day, it turns out there is a counter (egg station).‚Ä¶",Hilton_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel_Residences-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel_Residences,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

I ordered VIP catering from hotel to take away. Everything went very smooth all thanks to her help. Also a big thank you to the chefs who were very accommodating.

Sure the place offers a great view, but lacks atmosphere. Breakfast is served in the same place. Buffet is well garnished, offers many varieties of tastes and flavours with good quality products.

I must say of all the Hilton‚Äôs I‚Äôve had the good fortune to stay at across the world this one has the biggest heart.

Having said that, I was impressed with most of what the Hilton Tangier City Center Hotel & Residences had to offer during my stay. I also had my status matched to Hilton Diamond, so I was given a club floor room and don‚Äôt know if that had an impact on the stay or not. The good: staff service was excellent in room service (Kawtor was the sweetest room attendant, who not only serviced the room but provided extra touches like rose petals on the bed, a daily note, and a nice curtain display), and the front desk and concierge employees spent extra effort in tracking down a lost suitcase‚Ä¶",Hilton_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel_Residences-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel_Residences,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The room Service staff were polite both taking the orders and delivery. The food was good 1 time and terrible the next. The conceirge guys were all really polite and efficient. Cons There was no turn down service. Even though I called and asked on the 1st day they said yes of course there is about 10 mins later a guy showed up at the door with 2 towels. We were tired from an entire day out and couldn't be bothered insisting. We never got a turn down service in the 5 days. We constantly had to keep asking for clean towels.

Two employees were especially noteworthy: Jamal in F&B is attentive, friendly, eager to please, and seems always to have a smile on his face. In all the Hilton properties I've visited, he is one of the finest employees I've met, always seeking to help you feel welcome with a little extra energy.

We left to Casablanca and checked into HyattRegency and used the club room for breakfast and sunset and it was excellent for food and wine. We stayed 5 nights at Hilton Tangier and each night was different in the executive lounge. The food was old and dried up tasteless for lite bites.

Having travelled extensively, why is it the hotels have a lingering smell of cigarettes in the bedrooms in this day an age. Why is it these places particularly the Middle East countries think it's acceptable to allow people to smoke in bars. This smoke then lingers into the bedrooms and then you spend the night coughing and leave the hotel with your clothes smelling like an ash tray.

 September 2018,1,Robbed,Unfortunately I've got robbed here. Just in front of the the hotel where are at least 3 security guys standing. Makes me wondering if they also weren't involved in this incident. The police refused to come so I had made my way to the police station. At least hotel had some decency not to charge me for hotel car to get there. Only one manager were helpful another just pretended he cared. I advised my company about this unfortunate situation. And hopefully they will change the accommodation for safer place. Room: The drain in shower was constantly clogged. Executive lounge: The worst selection of food and drinks I've seen in Hilton in my 12 years travel. Security: As mentioned before. There is no need to be there.

Another toast attempt, 1 hour later and nothing. Pool - ICE COLD in September: Not heated at all and a complete waste of time, we left before we were attacked by a polar bear. Housekeeping - Inconsistent and poor: What they did, they did well, unfortunately they often didn't replace shampoo etc and then we were waiting for hours for replacements to be sent up.

Although rooms were spacious and bed was comfortable, the hotel did not offer what we were looking for. Breakfast was like a jungle, full of kids crying and running around and nobody did anything. Furthermore, it was difficult to find a table and usually we had to wait for 20 minutes or more. Additionally, we found difficult to find someone who speak English at the hotel (namely at the pool and the bar/restaurant). At the reception, we wanted to change euros to dirhams and it wasn't possible, even though they told me it was possible by email before our arrival.

 July 2018,5,Wonderful base to explore Tangier and Chefchaouen,"Stayed in a one-bedroom suite with my wife and our niece. It was a great choice since the room had two bathrooms and showers, a king bed and a sofa bed. Moreover, the Hilton offers free parking which was important to us since we were driving around Morocco. The area where the Hilton located is very modern. While the hotel is a 10 to 15 minute car ride from the Medina, it is a 5 minute walk to the beach, and the shopping center is right next to the hotel. The food at the hotel was very good. Breakfast is buffet style with a wide variety of choices including eggs cooked to order. We also had dinner one night at the top floor restaurant.

The service is not very good, the reception is small and understaffed. I had to wait quite a long time to check in. The restaurant staff is very slow and not very attentive.

The bad: Now keep in mind that we were here during Ramadan, which may or may not have been an influence. Obviously, this is an American hotel chain so you would expect liquor to be available and it was sort of. We tried twice to get a drink and we failed both times.

 September 2017,5,New hotel near the beaches and mall,"We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Tangier. This is a new hotel. I read reviews of people staying at older hotels who had to be dropped off a corner somewhere because the streets were too narrow for their taxi to make its way to the front of the hotel. I, personally, didn't want to have to drag my luggage through the streets of Tangier but I did want to be close to everything. The Hilton was great for that. This hotel does have security though. That was a first to me to see security protocols at a hotel. I was fine with it. Safety first. They have a large lobby with different areas of seatings. It seems they offer welcome drinks if you arrive between a certain time. We didn't arrive until midnight so there were no welcome drinks for us. We didn't take a cab from the airport.
