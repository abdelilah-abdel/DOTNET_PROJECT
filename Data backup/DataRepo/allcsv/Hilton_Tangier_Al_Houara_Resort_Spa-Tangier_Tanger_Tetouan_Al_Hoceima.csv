 January 2023,1,Horrible experience,"Absolutely poor service. They spoiled my New year eve completely. In this hotel they don’t care about clients. We booked King Grand Deluxe 2bedroom Suite Ocean View TWO BEDRM SUITE-OCEAN VIEW (120 m2) en BB, when we came to our room it turned out that we had just simple twin room for 4. I had to dispute with reception staff, which is extremely unfriendly! Room service doesn’t exist, in my opinion. I ordered 3 coca-cola 3 hours ago, I suppose that it’s better to go to the nearest shop to buy it! Never ever again I will stay here.

 July 2021,5,Perfection to the core.,"Absolutely outstanding hotel perfectly located between Tangier and assails… Helpful, friendly staff who go above and beyond to make sure you have the best time… The front desk manager Nourdine’s welcome was very warm and professional, it was just getting busy when we wanted to check in, Nourdine came in, assisted us and made sure we were happy with the type of room and everything else. As a diamond member for the past 8 years I should be used to the extra attention and perks but this particular hotel and it’s wonderful staff really wowed us. All amenities were out of this world, the activities and facilities are for all ages. You really don’t need to leave the property as it has its own private beach, golf course, quads, pools, spa… you name it. ☺️ Also an excellent breakfast…",Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The hotel is just gorgeous, breakfast choices are superb, the apartment was huge with ocean views (you can never get tired of the view and the roar!) spa was a magical treat each day for me and is well set up. Kids club and activities are great too. My husband plays good golf and says that the course is in great condition, the design is very good too, much better solution to playing on costa del sole and paying a fortune. Pool was heated (so pleased! and we used it!) although out of season-we spend Christmas week here. The entertainment program was amazing-good music, beautiful food and kids party.

I’ve long been a loyal Hilton brand portfolio customer and I’ve stayed at your hotels everywhere in the world, However, Al Houra in Tangier really stood among others and left me with quite an impression. I am really satisfied with the service, the cleanliness was immaculate, the food, facility, and just about everything I expected from Hilton but then your team surpassed a standard way above and beyond. It’s the little details and personal touches that really made me feel welcome and taken care of. I’m already planning my next stay, believe it or not.

 October 2022,5,Great stay,Beautiful location staff was excellent. Felt like pricing was fair. You may pay little more for an airport transfer however so worth it no issues. Pool bar was excellent closed for winter. Breakfast buffet was outstanding as expected by Hilton. This location goes above any other properties of Hilton that I have stayed which makes for a great way to start a day.

Here is a list of elements that highlights the staff/people quality issues. I hope this will be picked up in the next staff stand up meeting as this location is very nice and the resourcing should match the quality of the resort infrastructure and expensive price: 1 element: Check-in at Front Desk with Mohamed H. : Front Desk staff member M.H. was not respectful at all and not welcoming.

We asked them to repair NON-STOP for 3h straight and they couldnt do! They advised us instead to put our baby sleeping between me and my husband which is very unsafe for him! Not only they ruined our mood and program but they took such things as the least concern which should be the priority of an international group! We dont play with safety and security of people, let alone todlers and babies where small acccidents can be fatale! They only made the effort when i went down to reception and complained!

I dine out in the states 6-7 times a week and I would say this was one of the top experiences I ever had. We got there 10 min after they were closed and we were welcomed in anyways, they spent the hour or so that we were there just making sure we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves.

The positives: If you're looking for a relaxing and peaceful escape from the city, this resort checks that box. It's located about 25 minutes outside of the main city, on a secluded beach and nature preserve. They have free parking, and plenty of it, if you have a rental car. It's a sprawling resort, with multiple large pools, a beautiful lobby, and multiple areas to sit and watch the beach from a distance.

Guests still feel entitled to smoke inside the hotel in 2022, which does not line up with health and safety standards set by the brand. The property looks a bit shabby and dirty, and either needs to change the exterior color to better integrate with the environment, or invest in power washing. The food and service is excellent, and the location is wonderful. The place has prayer rooms, which was a nice surprise.

There are a few things to consider: -The hotel is in between Tangier & Asilah, with nothing nearby. Taxis do not come to the property unless they are called, so factor this in when making a hotel decision if you don’t have a car. -Prices are very expensive for food & room service. -Our king suite had a stunning view of the ocean & property.

In front of this behaviour unsuitable for a 5 stars Hotel employee, we insisted to have a new room and a commercial gesture. The Guest Relation Manager Miss Yasmina A. refused and threatened us to call security. After several hours in the reception, yelling and insisting to have a new room, an other manager accepted our request but we had to change 3 times a room an the last one didn’t have warm water neither. We were too tired to come back to the reception. I hope this Manager will be spotted by the hierarchy for her inability to answer to the basic requests coming from a client… Having warm water in a room and talking politely without arrogance.",Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The head of service, Jalil, was very attentive to our needs and checked in with us periodically. Loubna at the front desk was so kind to send us a treat to help celebrate a birthday. My wife and I travel extensively and have rarely had such good service. The only con, in our opinion: - the food was underwhelming, overall.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite and we thought it would be a great family option. We were wrong. Service The service level at the front desk was absolutely appalling. At check in we were asked to sit on an uncomfortable bench opposite the reception (which was relatively small) and waited for the next available agent. No one paid us any attention for 15 minutes – so I marched up to the front desk and asked what was going on (considering we were driven there from Fes so we had a long day).

I knew the limitations of its location in advance, just keep in mind it really is not convenient to any place. Took us over an hour from Tangier with bad traffic. Transportation is quite inflated in price for both the airport and city. On the map it is surrounded by green but we could not find any hiking trails or forest to explore, though we did enjoy walking around the extensive grounds that will eventually be a golf course (which you may love if you are a golfer but I had mixed feelings about seeing the natural habitat developed artificially.) The beach in front of and nearby the hotel is raw and undeveloped, and strewn with trash in places.

The swimming pools are wonderful as are the free mint teas in the lobby area. Very clean, spotless hotel, great rooms and a very comfortable bed. Bathroom superb. Breakfast was great, plenty of variety. Great staff. Dinner was poor, catering quality and variety was limited over the week we stayed. With no alternatives to choose from outside the hotel this needs to be tweaked. Lucky for Hilton the staff of this hotel are wonderfull.

We had booked the 2 bedroom apartment with ocean views and Miriam showed us several available to get just the perfect view.

The lobby very charming and the reception's staff were doing eveyrthing to make it simple for you either for check in or check out. I may report only one thing that I was not satisfied about it, which is the beach where there was no parasols and no service. The manager explained to me that is because the hotel has opened on April 2019, and they have not yet got the right to use the beach as a hotel. But you can of course go there since it is public.

My partner and I both agree that the hotel was beautiful, the pool and access to the beach were great however the hotel website made the resort appear fully open which isn’t the case. The hotel was sold to have a golf course, spa with barbers and resources such as an onsite shop. None of these were open, or available to guests - this is something we only found out once we had arrived at the hotel.

There are plenty of sun loungers and parasols and a poolside drinks service which is helpful but not pushy.

The hotel just opened so not all services were available (SPA and activities have not started yet.) Overall, I would definitely do it again. Just one remark, the food menu should include more local products. Food prices are a bit on the high side.",Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2019,3,A hotel with potential but a couple of issues to be addressed,"We chose this hotel as we were in Tangier for only 2 nights and had a early flight home - this hotel is indeed close to the airport and also close to the beach. However, the beach hasn't been cleaned yet ; the surroundings of the hotel in general aren't fully cleaned / landscaped yet, still under construction. We had a couple issues that altered the quality of our stay: - Bathroom: the shower door wasn't properly sealed so the leak flooded the bathroom. The hot and cold taps were reversed. The bathroom wasn't fully clean when we arrived. - Dining experience: we were given contradictory information about dining options. We were there on a Sunday and the all-day dining restaurant was closed. The only option we had for food was a snacking bar or room service, which was a bad look…",Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2019,3,Need more team members,"The location and the view are amazing but the problem was with the room service and also they don’t call back when there’s no one to answer , everything else was amazing i recommend the hotel to spend your vacation",Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2019,4,"Beautiful new property, but no liquor license and far away from the city area","The hotel is a very luxe and a top of the line resort with an amazing seaside view. It is about 40 minutes from Tangier city location Hilton (which is a better alternative.) If you are looking to ""escape"" and golf, then this is the one for you. Check if the liquor license has been issued yet and whether restaurants and bars are open before booking, as this might be a disappointing surprise, as it was for us.",Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2019,5,Wonderful stay,"The hotel is magic, specially in the sunset, you can feel the nature and enjoy a good time away from the normal life. The room, the bathroom, the terrace, were perfect, specially the bathrobe, a completely relaxing sensation. We felt welcome from the first moment we have arrived, the concierge and the reception team walked us by the hotel and explain the hotel structure and all the facilities/services. Every team of the staff was warm and friendly, at the reception, housekeeping, swimming pool, at the dinner and, in particular at the breakfast: all the breakfast team were smiling and taking particular attention to the details (they catch your preferences and anticipate your needs). Also, we love hummus, and they had made us find 3 kind of hummus the following day!! We have…",Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Tangier_Al_Houara_Resort_Spa,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
