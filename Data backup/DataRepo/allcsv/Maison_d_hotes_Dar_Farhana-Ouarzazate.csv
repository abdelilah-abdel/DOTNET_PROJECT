 July 2022,5,Dar Farhana: simply excellent!!,"Dar Farhana Is a very quiet place with an excellent service. Abdul was very kind and always aware to make our stay nice and easy. The rooms were very nice, well decorated and vey clean. We also had dinner there and we enjoyed a lot. For sure, we'll go back there.",hotelName,city
 June 2022,5,Excellent Riad in Ouarzazate,"Dar Farhana is one of the best hospitality experiences I ever had in my life, and I travel a lot. The Riad is owned by a charming family who will treat you like family, thanks Ouarda, Ibrahim and Karim!. The riad is spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated, very comfortable, peaceful and the swimming pool is sooooo beautiful and inviting. The breakfast is delicious. All my needs and requests were met with a smile and understanding, they speak French and English fluently (and probably other languages too). They also assigned their wonderful receptionist Ayoub to guide me on a memorable afternoon excursion to a desert oasis he knew well, thanks Ayoub, you are the greatest. The riad is a few minutes ride from the center. If you have a car + gps, it will be easy to find and there are…",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 May 2022,5,Greatest place in Ouarzazate,"This is the most hospitable place I have ever stayed. The staff is wonderful and Ouarda is extremely helpful and accommodating. The food is fresh and they provide you with everything you need to be comfortable. I slept so well here after traveling for over one month. The garden and courtyard area is so lovely. I was having difficulties booking my flight from here to Casablanca online, and Ouarda did everything she could to help me, including taking me into town to convert my cash and then to the airport so that I could book directly with the airline there. I am so grateful to have chosen this sweet Riad and highly recommend anyone stay here if they’re staying in Ouarzazate. These people treat you like family and are so pleasant.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 May 2022,5,Hands-down best stay of our trip,"I fell in love with this place the minute I walked in. Everything was magic. Beautiful rooms, lots of terraces to choose from shade or sun, everything beautifully decorated with gorgeous textiles and many plants. The food was the best I had in all Morocco and the two charming men hosting us made our stay absolutely fantastic. Do stay in and have dinner there, breakfast was also great (no end to it!) Rooms were cool and decorated with attention to detail, very comfy beds, lots of towels, just all round great facilities. Excellent wifi everywhere. Our family loved it here.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 November 2021,5,Really excellent stay !,"- Thanks Karim for his warm welcome, his kindness and his availability : Any time he was there to respond to all our requests. - The rooms are spacious, very clean and well heated and above all well appointed with good bedding. - The meals were generous and absolutely delicious, we eat an authentic good Moroccan cuisine. - Karim organized an excellent bivouac for us in the oasis of Fint, which made our trip truly unforgettable. I strongly recommend DAR FARHANA",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 October 2019,5,Courteous,"Tucked away in a non descript alley, one finds this very sweet little Riad run by a really very friendly and courteous family , the swimming pool and courtyard area is very pretty. We had dinner there one night and it was really delicious. There are only around 6 rooms. The family help you with whatever you may require. Members of the owners family can also help out with taxi service",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 June 2019,5,Best experience ever!,"We can't stop dreaming about our time in Ouarzazate and the Dar Farhana. Our family really fell in love with this place and we will for sure be back - hopefully soon. The rooms, the pool area, the food, the owners - everything was just perfect. We had a warm welcome and a great dinner the first night. Because of that we changed our plans for the upcoming days and cancelled our accomodation in Zagora after one night. We returned to Ouarzazate to have more time at Dar Farhana and it was the best decision ever. Everybody was so nice and warm hearted, we felt like we were at home. They loved our kids, too. Thanks so much to Karim and his family for everything! Eda, Tobi, Levi and Iva",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 March 2019,4,Tasty home made food,"The owners were very nice. They helped us to urgently find a doctor. We got the home made food brought to our room, which was delicious; same for the breakfast we had on the roof top. The room was clean and tidy but small. A nice stopover in Ouarzazate if you have a car as it is a bit far from the main street.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 January 2019,4,Nicest owner!,"We stayed here for only one night on our way to Marrakech. The hotel is distant from the city center, so for people staying longer it might not be the best option. The owner is extremely nice and welcoming. He went above and beyond to make sure our family had a nice stay. We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel and the food was great. One of the best breakfasts we had at a hotel in Morocco.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 November 2018,2,nice but remote,"A beautiful interior court yard, a lovely hostess, great breakfast and meals, an ok room without any particular eatures. BUT the place is in the middle of nowhere at the end of a dirt road in a densely built new neighbourhood with a lot of raw concrete. No shop, no restaurant in the surroundings, nothing within walking distance if you want to stroll outside after your arrival. One is stuck without a car. And to navigate the dark and narrow dirt lanes in a rental car after dark is no fun.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 October 2018,5,Great stop over in Ouarzazate,"Such a great stay! This place can be a little hard to find but follow the signs and you’ll be just fine. Ibrahim greeted us upon arrival with tea, coffee and cookies - much needed after a long drive. We sat by the pool and rested a bit while Ibrahim confirmed our room. We had hoped for dinner and were pleasantly surprised with what was an amazing meal. Breakfast the next morning was just awesome as well. Our room was on the main level right outside the lobby and parlor and had the potential to be pretty noisy. But it all worked out just great - no complaints at all. Totally recommend this place but just expect to be a bit away from the city center.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 April 2018,1,Stay,"We have spent one night at this property on April, the owner didn’t speak English very well, so we have problem to communicate with him, and the price was very expensive as for the city. Furthermore, the house is very far from the city center and difficult to find so if you don’t have a car do not come. When we want to pay by credit card they add 3% fee to total price. It was the worst experience in the south of Morocco. I don’t recommend this property at all",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 May 2018,5,Best stay in Morocco,"The accommodation was just perfect, we only had issues to get there, since it is a bit hidden, but otherwise we couldn't recommend it more. Everything is so nice, the breakfast is good, the pool area and the small garden is great, everyone was friendly and helpful and the rooms spacious and clean. We would have loved to stay many more days!",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 April 2018,5,Wonderful stop in Ouarzazate,"We were greeted by the very warm and cordial host Ibrahim upon arrival. It was dark after we'd arrived with our excellent guide, Hassan Gabsi (you can find my review of him in the Travel Forum), who had lined up the lodging on our private trip for our family of 4. As it was our 2nd night in Morocco, we didn't have a tremendous amount to base any comparison on and went in with open minds. After ambling though Ouarzazate's city streets at night, we came upon Dar Farhana and were pleasantly surprised at how absolutely clean and charming the establishment was. After stowing our baggage we toured the property before dinner. The garden area was magical and was complemented by a beautiful swimming pool. Dinner was taken in a dining room overlooking the pool. The rooms were very…",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 March 2018,5,Very high recommendation,The place is very good and Ibrahim is a welcoming host. The rooms are neat and the little park with the pool is a nice refugee to relax. Dar Farhana is hard to find but worth the effort! I highly recommend starting here to explore Morocco's South!,Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 February 2018,5,Good option,The place is a bit hidden and the GPS does not help much. We had to resort to people on the street to show us the way. It would be interesting to place signs along the way. The facilities are very good and the staff is very helpful.,Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 January 2018,5,A little out of the way but definitely worth it!,"A really great find! We booked this last minute but we couldn't have been happier with our choice! Ibrahim and all of the staff were so nice and welcoming. The place itself is just beautiful, with all the oranges growing in the courtyard and the pool. Dinner was fantastic. After our 9th day in Morocco we were expecting another tajine but the owner was thinking the same and surprised us with a seafood pastilla and it was so good, my husbands favorite dinner of the trip! Breakfast was also amazing. One of our top two of the trip with so many different options. I especially loved the honey. Always important to me is the shower and that it is warm with good pressure. I was pretty happy with this one. The wifi was also very reliable. As eluded to in my title, it is a little drive to…",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 December 2017,5,"Very climatic place, recomended!","We stayed here twice, came back mostly for the amazing breakfast served on a rooftop, and lovely interior with climatic garden. As we were here in winter, we didn't use the swimming pool, but it looked very inviting. It's a charming place, you can take a really good rest here. The owners are lovely, too.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 November 2017,5,Short and sweet,"Stopped by this riad for a short night. It was absolutely perfect. And even though its location is nit central, Ibrahim generously drove us around. Breakfast was delicious and room lovely and comfortable.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 October 2017,5,Hidden Oasis in Ourzazate!,Brahim and his family are wonderful hosts in this little cozy Maison d'hôte. You can find a lovely garden with a swimming pool and pomegranate and clementine trees. The food was delicious! Brahim is very generous and helps organizing other locations in Marocco. He organized a Riad in Essaouira for us for a better price than online. We enjoyed it very much!,Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 October 2017,5,Best Riad we stayed in Morocco,Riad owner Ibraham is absolutely wonderful. We enjoyed out stay very much. This has been one of the best stays we've had in Morocco. Staff was so attentive and genuinely kind. It is so wonderful to see such care and pride the owner puts into running his Riad. Riad itself is beautiful on the interior with a garden. Rooms are clean and beds are very comfortable. It has been the most peaceful and restful stay we had so far in Morocco! Thank You so much!,Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 August 2017,5,Nice experience in Ouarzazate,"Very nice place, with moroccan architecture, Ibrahim is a very warm host, he gives you all the informations needed for your trip in the area, the breakfast is tasty, was a good experience I recommend it!",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 July 2017,5,Beautiful Authentic Guest House,"This place was so amazing, I wish we could stay longer! It's a beautiful family house that Ibrahim (the owner) has restored and decorated with excellent taste in traditional Moroccan style and with a beautiful courtyard with pomegranate trees and a swimming pool. We had breakfast and dinner on spot which we enjoyed very much - authentic, home made very delicious food! Ibrahim is very friendly and the general atmosphere of the place is really great - makes you feel at home immediately! It is the perfect place to stop and spend a couple of days on your way to or back from the desert. I hope I will have the chance to return",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 July 2017,5,An oasis of calm,"Dar Farhana is an oasis within the oasis town of Ouarzazate. Once you find it at the end of a dusty street, it is like reaching a water source in the desert. It is simply beautiful. Every little detail inside the house is thoroughly thought through and the hosts are always there to make you feel at home. In fact Dar Farhana means “Happy house”. All rooms have air condition, which was very helpful in the heat of the summer. So was the swimming pool, just next to the stunning garden with it’s many flowers and fruits, where you can have your breakfast or just sit and relax. The roof terrace is also a great place to retreat, whether it is to sunbath or to watch the stars. I especially enjoyed the friendly and relaxed atmosphere, so representative of Southern Morocco. I couldn’t…",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 April 2017,5,A New Favourite,"We spent two nights here in April 2017, once on the way to the desert and once on the way back. It is the perfect place to break the journey but don't use it just as a one night stop over. Dar Farhana is the sort of place where you could easily spend a week. Firstly, the building is beautiful. Lots of bright and brilliant plants and lovely furnishings. Rooms are simple but perfectly decorated. They are also spotlessly clean. What really makes this place special though is Brahim and the other staff. Everyone is so friendly and hospitable, we immediately felt at home here. We will definitely be visiting again on our next trip, highly recommended.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 April 2017,5,Nice calm serene hotel,"We had a very short stay here which is a shame as it had a lovely calm atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Comfy beds and ensuite bathroom. The room was a bit on the tight side but perfectly adequate. Generous fresh breakfast the next day was amazing. Very also able price too. Location was a bit tricky to find, but watch out for the painted signs on the corners of the buildings with arrows to help. Would definitely recommend.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 April 2017,5,Great experience,"This place was a real surprise. It has a nice tranquil court yard garden and swimming pool, and the hospitality was warm and welcoming. Our dinner here was the best meal of our trip. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. I thoroughly recommend this place to anyone looking for a charming and traditional riad experience.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 August 2016,5,A wonderful place!!!!,"I've been there and I found it traditional in a simple and refreshing way, I also enjoy my swim, as well as the food. The price was not much. I've never been to a place so calm and so natural better than this one. My stay at dar Farhan was the best and the calmest I ever had. I advise you to visit it.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 February 2016,5,Hospitality par excellence with some of the best food in Morocco,"We had the best dinner of our week long stay in Morocco at this hotel---we had a tagine dinner with tender succulent meat. The only does his best to put out the marhaba mat. Also the best bountiful breakfast in Morocco with eggs, cheese, meat, breads, coffee, tea, and fresh squeezed orange juice. Unlike other hotels they do not charge extra for water. The owner and staff did their best to make sure we felt at home.",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 April 2014,5,A Nice Respite After the Desert,"Staying at Dar Farhana was a relief after spending two nights in the desert! We were welcomed with mint tea and a smile and stepping into the riad, we knew we would be comfortable. It's a new hotel with pretty modern furnishings, and a lush courtyard full of plants, rose bushes and trees...and a turtle too! The Hotel Room - Comfortable bed. Large room with air conditioning, and most importantly, very clean!! The Food - Wow - I had had several tagines by this point (this was my fifth night in Morocco) and the tagine at Dar Farhana was the first one I loved! Great flavor and the breakfast the next morning was delicious too. I especially loved the spice-stuffed Moroccan pancakes. I wish I knew how to make these at home! The first night, we dined in the courtyard, and the next…",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 February 2014,5,Exceptional Attention to Detail,"We have been in Morocco for over a week as we write this review. Dar Farhana is, without a doubt. the best of the beautiful ryads and guest houses we have enjoyed so far. Tucked away on a quiet street, one is taken by surprise by this gem. We were first served tea in typical Moroccan style in the lovely garden at the back of the guest house (where they will soon add a swimming pool). We were given our choice of rooms (low season) and found the bed and linens to be very comfortable with a large bathroom and wonderfully hot shower. We had dinner in the garden and breakfast the next morning on the rooftop terrace with a view of the Atlas Mountains. The food was a cut above, nicely seasoned and original. The service was excellent, attentive without being overbearing. The…",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 October 2013,5,Amazing place! Fantastique!,"Very comfortable beds, great food and the friendliest and most helpful staff ever. I stayed there on my way to the desert and I highly recommend Dar Farhana! I'm French but I live in Casablanca and I can honestly say that the warm welcome I have received here hasn't been matched during my two years in this country. The place is beautifully decorated, extremely clean with very nice individual bathrooms. Vraiment un petit coin de paradis, une literie d'excellente qualité, salle de bain individuelle très propre, tout est décoré avec beaucoup de goût. une repas était extra et l'accueil vraiment très chaleureux. Quel bonheur de rencontrer des gens aussi gentils et accueillants. J'ai passé une seule nuit dans cette maison d'hôte et je ne peux que la recommander!",Maison_d_hotes_Dar_Farhana,Ouarzazate
 December 2012,5,Cozy place!,"Dar Farhana is a oasis of tranquility, a lovely place to relax in Ouarzazate. The staff is very friendly and we had a warm welcome. The food is delicious.

 December 2012,5,Little paradise,"Farhana's like a little paradise. The very recent hotel is beautifully decorated and very cozy.
