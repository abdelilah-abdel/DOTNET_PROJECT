 May 2017,2,Underwhelmed,We forgot to download/star this place on our maps while we had internet. A local at the bus station helped us with our luggage and showed us the way.

Although the staff seemed unapproachable with little assistance on what to do in the region. The included breakfast was substandard unless you like preserves and toast. The internet was down for most of our four day stay. The lights were temperamental and couldn't rely on the bathroom light to remain lit whilst using.,Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira

 June 2016,1,Double charged - ripped off,"I stayed here in a double room for 3 nights in June after making my booking through booking.com. Upon check out the hotel receptionist requested I pay my hotel room charge in local currency (dirhams) despite having in advance my MasterCard credit card details through the booking.com site and I was happy to do so. However it was not until I obtained my credit card statement that I realised that the Riad had charged my credit card as well for the 3 nights accommodation. All efforts made direct to the hotel and also through booking.com over the past 5 weeks have proven unsuccessful. Obviously the receptionist found this an easy way just to pocket a lot of money, so I would caution ever staying or using this Riad based on these practices.

I have never spent a night in Essaouira so on a recent visit to Marrakech, I looked at the prices of a Riad for the night there. So cheap!!! my friend and I booked travel through SupraTours, cost around £7 one way. the Riad is easy to find and in the heart of the Medina. Its a beautiful place and the atmosphere was wonderful. Stayed in a twin room which looked out over the Medina. The staff were friendly but not English speakers, that always makes it more fun and challenges you to use another language. the room was tidy, clean and perfect for our needs. the beds were comfortable. Breakfast was amazing, filled up nicely and lovely fresh orange juice and good coffee!",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 February 2016,3,Really not that great,"The place is cheap which is great. The rooms however are quite ugly and problematic. Both rooms we checked, the windows had huge gaps and didn't close well. This means that on the (really) cold February night we had to turn the heater to the maximum, cover with two bedcovers and close the curtains to partially stop the crazy flow of cold air. Also the windows are so thin that you can hear everything on the street below. Staff was accomodating, breakfast nice and the terrace is quite good. But nothing really like the photos you see here or expect from the reviews. We stayed at other Riads for a fraction of a higher price which make this one look like a run down motel. Would not suggest it further.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira

The staff were really nice and helped us to find a great hammam and cooking class at Villa Maroc (highly recommend).

So, if I hadn't checked my bank account, I would have overpaid. Soon after arrival I noticed that my wallet is gone [I had it in my hand, so there is a small chance that I dropped it just before entering the riad. Therefore cannot say for sure that it was stolen.] The sign of the riad is very high, there are no markings on or near the entrance door. No A/C, thankfully it was not hot in Essaouira [in August].

All in all, we had a great couple of nights there.

The noise became unbearable, so got dressed and went to reception, security said this happens all the time and the police do nothing, he did ring the police straight away and they did nothing!! I got very little sleep and to see the men in this state was not a pretty sight. We were offered to wait until 12 noon to see if another room may become available. But decided to get out ASAP as we didn't feel comfortable in the hotel.

When we went to the reception to complain about this, the girl told us that it is same everywhere in Essaouira.., but we doubt it. Wifi worked Okay. The breakfast was just average. The room was tidy but small, nothing like you see on photos. Location is great in the middle of Medina.

 May 2014,3,Central location,We stayed two nights at the riad. It was about a 10 minute walk from the bus station and we only got lost once but people were helpful and showed us where to go. The sign for the riad was only facing one direction and of course it was not the direction we were walking. Upon our arrival we were given a glass of mint tea that was very good. The room was comfortable and had a view to the side street which also created a lot of night noise. People were outside talking until 2 AM and we could hear everything they said so not a lot of sleep. The shower in the bathroom had no lip around it so when you showered the bathroom floor got wet.

 April 2014,4,A good place to stay,"We spent 2 nights at this raid. Before arrival we had sent them an email asking them if they could book a taxi for us from Agadir airport since we had no other means of getting to Essaouira. The taxi driver was waiting for us at the airport and we had a pleasant ride. The riad itself is in the middle of the medina, easy to find and easy to get back to anytime. We were in room 6, which was a family room ( we had only asked for twin), with two single beds and a double. It was a good size room. Since the room overlooked the street side it was very loud, but all in all it was an enjoyable stay.

 March 2014,1,Look elsewhere,"Unfortunately, we were bothered by construction noises in our room and could not use it to take a much needed break from the sun when we returned to the Riad around midday. Also, we had no water to take a shower on several occasions, and the shower head had no wall mount so you had to shower one-handed. Staff were unable to amend these problems, and would not agree on a discount.

 June 2013,5,Great place to stay,I stayed here with a friend for a week a couple of years ago for the music festival and a few days to chill.

It is in the middle of the medina and close to the main squares and sea. We were greeted with tea and biscuits each afternoon and breakfast was served daily on the veranda by the two most friendly ladies. On a couple of occasions we chose to eat dinner at the hotel and the food was all fresh and good. Our room was of a good size and very clean.

 June 2013,4,above average,"this has some bad points, but the kindness of the staff compensate, for example the room was not ready by 14h30, but the man in the reception cooked us moroccan tea to apologize, which we really appreciated. the standard rooms are so small that I felt I would lack oxygen during the night, and the sunlight enters the room unavoidably at the morning due to the light curtains, so I, like many other previewers here, woke up many times since dawn.

 December 2012,5,Simply Awesome,I had the large room to myself. 1 single bed and 1 queen. In the heart of Medina. Just below my window where I can witness all the happening of the medina at my own comfort. Though it can get noisy but it was a my company since I traveled solo. Love the decor. Love the cleanliness. Love everything about this riad. A few steps away from the public hamma (public hot bath). Pictures paint a thousand word. MUST STAY!,Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 December 2012,5,"Riad Le Grande Large, Essaouira","Chose this partly due to price as we are a family of six, and it was very reasonable especially as breakfast was included. Staff were friendly and we communicated well spite no English being spoken. All our rooms were clean and well presented, although ours (no1) was the smallest and smelt slightly damp. Beds were clean and made daily by the lovely female staff, breakfast was wonderful, made fresh for us each morning by the same and served on the roof terrace. We really enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle down below from the roof terrace both morning and evening. Was a little bit noisy at times in the evening/night but so conveniently located in the heart of the Medina that this was only to be expected and not that much of a negative. Would recommend this Riad.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 October 2012,5,A Little Gem,"We booked here last minute because the Riad where we had originally booked wouldnt bring our booking fwd by one night without adding a hefty charge. The riad was within easy walking distance from the bus station, and nestled in a labyrinth of streets right in the heart of the medina. The staff were so very welcoming, by far the friendliest we have encountered in Morocco, they made us feel like family. We had a really nice room with a window out onto a small street. The room was comfortable and clean, the bathroom was the cleanest hotel bathroom we have come across in Morocco and everything was working perfectly. I loved the terrace, clean and attractive and a lovely place to eat breakfast.I did find the breakfast a little boring, though I loved the coffee and juice, and again…",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 October 2012,2,Basic riad,"I stayed one night at this riad. The room (no 4) was clean but smell was terrible. High humidity, probably because of proximity to the ocean. Good location in the heart of Medina, easy to find. Breakfast was ok on rooftop. Very friendly staff. Wifi only available at reception area.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 October 2012,3,Was alright - a place to stay.,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for a couple nights towards the end of our trip to Morocco. It was ok, purely as a place to stay. I'm not overly fussy where I stay as long as its clean as I'm only there to sleep, but my boyfriend can be quite the opposite. The location is really good and easy to find, the breakfasts were really good and our room was clean, however did smell like damp - but after research prior to booking I did expect this as it seems to be something I have read often in reviews of many riads in Essaouira, but this damp smell may also be because the shower curtain didn't actually reach the floor so provided no purpose whatsoever as it didn't stop the water splashing everywhere, and flooding the bathroom haha! The riad was not as nice and staff were not as…",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 October 2012,4,As central as you can find :),"The Riad is really central and it won't be any trouble to find! The Staff is nice, the room and bathroom are not new, but very confortable and clean! The room had a window for the main street from which it was really good to watch Essaouira lifestyle! :) Breakfast is very good on the terrace! :)",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 September 2012,5,"Good location, great Staff and clean room!","Great time in this Riad. Essaouira was very great experience and this Riad was perfect for this. Good quality, clean room, great breakfast and young and available staff. Just perfect. Just one thing... WiFi should be available in terrace too and not just and first and second floor but... who use WiFi when you have a great city like Essaouira? :-D",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 January 2012,3,Budget choice for short-term stay,We stayed in this basic hostel in winter months (january) and we were rather satisfied. It was a fair deal for the money paid but we wouldn't like to stay there longer than 3 nights. Good central location in the medina. Staff was friendly but sometimes not very communicative in English. Our room was rather cramped and a bit humid but the rooftop terrace made up for it. Decent breakfast was served. We had to run to the ATM given that no card payment was possible.,Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 March 2012,4,would stay again,"Having driven the whole way across Morocco I was not in the mood to have to hunt for our accomodation. My mood worsened. Granted, had we booked the Riad before we were in Morocco we would have been more prepared, but the streets are so hard to navigate and very busy, so easy to get overhwhelmed and lost looking, which makes you prey for Moroccan men to talk to you and annoy you (harsh, but true). However, once we found it, it was actually in a really easy place to find and reference to, right in the middle of all the excitement. Easy to find everything you need right on your doorstep and I would definitely return. Staff were lovely and friendly and was very refreshing and reassuring to see a female! (our experiences of Moroccan men were not at best at this point) Breakfast…",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 February 2012,4,lovely riad,"we had a beautiful room with an outlook onto the street, the riad had a a lovely rooftop and breakfast was great. would thoroughly recommend.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 November 2011,5,very good hotel,"Hotel is located in Medina, very easy to find. Pleasant staff. Hotel is beautifully decorated, especially the corridors. Tasty breakfasts.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 October 2011,5,Good riad to stay in Essaouira,"Good location, middle of souks and near medina and the beach plus it was easy to find. My room was comfortable, double for one person and the water pressure in the shower was good. Breakfast was served up on the roof terrace which was also a nice place to relax during the day and early evening. The riad was quite busy/full when I stayed there and some people had to wait for others to leave before getting an available table at breakfast time. I was usually the first one up there thus it didn’t bother me ;) Fellow travellers were also friendly and I had lovely chats with many of them throughout my stay. Having my own bottle of wine was no problem at all. In fact, the staff were happy to borrow a bottle opener and a glass for me. The reception had a computer with Internet…",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 August 2011,4,Nice place to stay,"Fantastic location within the medina. Step outside the door and you're in the centre of the action, yet no noise issues. Our room was perhaps not the most luxurious we stayed in during our time in Morocco, but it was clean, functional and represented fantastic value for money. Breakfast on the terrace was freshly cooked and a real delight, and the lovely staff couldn't do enough to help. Highly recommended!",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 August 2011,3,"Ok for budget travelers, would not go back.","This riad was ok. I cannot say much more than that. The best part is the roof terrace where breakfast is served every morning; it is very pretty and you can look down into the street below. The breakfast itself was a little disappointing, fruit juice, bread and jam, sometimes with some boiled eggs. The staff were very quiet but polite. The room and bed clothes were dirty - the decor is very dated which would not have bothered me at all if it had been clean! The bathroom lights were broken so we had to leave the door open when taking a shower. The shower was ok but a bit temperamental temperature wise! The riad is in a good location but it is extremely noisy all night - take ear plugs if you are a light sleeper!",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 June 2011,5,Great Experience,"Beautiful riad, very friendly, helpful staff (most spoke minimal English, one spoke English very well but this wasn't really a problem). Good location and easy to find. When we arrived we went to the rooftop to see the view. Wonderful smells were coming from kitchen. We were invited in where Jasmina was cooking lunch for the staff. We commented on how good it looked and smelled and were asked if we would like some. We asked for just one order and were given stuffed sardines, fish tagine, tea, salad, bread, a large bottle of water and fresh melon, Plenty for two people and all for 120 dh (12euros)! It was so delicious we asked to have lunch again the next day. Our lunch was made to our order and was again delicious. All in all a wonderful experience.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 May 2011,4,"Clean, Good Location and the sweetest ""Yemena"" serving breakfast","I traveled in Morocco for 3 1/2 weeks and visited Essaouira toward the end of my trip. I booked in advance and ended up getting a much better rate that the posted rate. Riad Le Grand Large wasn't exactly large, the room was a little cramped, but the location was great and the room was cleaned daily. The staff is French speaking, but you can get by with English. ""Yemena"" the lady who served breakfast was the sweetest women I encountered while in Morocco. While our communication was basically nonexistent it was great to sit with her at breakfast and she was great at the coffee refills! She repeatedly said what sounded like ""internet"" so hopefully she'll be happy to know I posted her picture below. If you stay here don't miss the opportunity to meet Yemena!",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 April 2011,5,"friendly, good value, pretty roof terrace, excellent shower","Welcomed with mint tea, clean rooms, comfortable bed, although pillows a bit firm for my liking. Lovely traditional interior design and the best shower I had in Morocco. Usual breakfast on lovely comfortable Roof terrace - also a good place for a quiet read. Not a 'smart' hotel but a comfortable one-apart from the pillows. I'd definitely stay here again.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 May 2011,5,Wonderful Riad in the middle of the Medina,This riad in the center of the Medina in Essaouria and offers a home away from home. The rqtes are very reasonable and the staff very friendly. I was pleasantly greeted by Amina and shown up to my room on the second floor (room no. 4) which had a double bed with its own bathroom and shower. The room was clean and nicely furnished in good Moroccan taste with high cielings and an extra loft bed. The rate includes breakfast on the beautiful terrace. Also there is free wifi and free use of computer in the lounge.,Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 April 2011,5,"Great location, staff and price",This little Riad set in the heart of the medina is a perfect place from which to explore the beauty and tranquility Of Essaouira. The Riad is spotless and everything from the wifi Internet to the showers works as you want. Probably best of all are the staff here. From the moment we arrived after a long 12 hour journey we were welcomed with smiles and helpfulness from all of the staff here. Special mention needs to go to Yemina who serves breakfast on the sunny terrace on the roof. She starts your morning with a smile and serves you delicious coffee and local honey and jams for your tasted bread. We wanted to stay longer but had to leave as they were full. Don't hesitate to nook in here for your time in Essaouira.,Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 February 2011,4,Good basic and central,Found this on Expedia for 22 euros breakfast on the terrace included which is very good value for somewhere clean and quiet with its own shower room. You can even use the internet for free.,Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 January 2011,4,Value for money,"The Riad Grand Large was a good riad, with helpfull (although only french speaking) staff. Real value for money with good location, clean rooms, and a nice terrace. The kitchen served great food, but the breakfast was a bit plain. As previously mentioned on tripadvisor, the rooms were a bit damp, but it wasn't a big problem.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 December 2010,5,Best Riad we had in Morocco,"We expected a cheap backpackers place, but this was the best riad we stayed of the 8 riad's we visited. Moreover, this place offers the best value for money. By far! The atmousphere was great, very relaxing. The riad is perfectely situated in the medina, but this place is very quiet en peacfull. This riad has severall nice lounge corners where you can read, play games or meet other travellers. We loved the roof terrace! The staff was extremely friendly and helpfull! The ladies were so nice when they found out that may boyfriend suffered from food poisening. They offered him green tea, hot chocolate and medicines. Just lovely!",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 December 2010,2,Good for one night and not more,"I stayed at the Riad Le Grand Large a couple of days ago. If you're looking for a place for a night, i recommend this hotel. Pros -Nice reception and very helpful. -Good Internet Connection -Staff are all very nice -Middle of Medina Cons -Bathroom flush keeps breaking -Floor is always wet in the shower room -Dangerous to walk at night after 10 pm, and I am a guy. -Long stairs to the terrace to get breakfast -Not easy to find the place -Very noisy outside -Not the most comfortable bed Although the hotel is cheap and the staff are all very nice, i won't come back to the hotel. I rather pay a bit more so that i can have a cleaner room and less noise outside.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 December 2010,4,Cheap and good location,"Very hard to find a decent riad at 25 euros but this is it. Took us ages to find it as we used google maps....bad idea. Great location, no frills and fiendly receptionist. Go for it.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 November 2010,4,A Hidden Gem,"A small Riad in the heart of the old Medina, very atmospheric giving a real feel of Marocco. They were very good in cancelling one of our night stay with them without charge when we found that we had to leave after one night due to the local holidays and the cancellation of the bus service to Agadir.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 November 2010,5,Good value and location,Good location close to everything in the old town. Bright and colorfully painted on the inside. Great value - we paid about $35 a night for an en-suite double room. Excellent showers compared to other riads we stayed in! Staff was mostly French-speaking.,Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 June 2010,4,Great value for location,This riad is in a perfect location.In the centre of the medina and easy walking distance to the beach.The price reflects the standard of accomadation.The rooms are quite small but functional.Breakfast served on the roof terrace is lovely.The staff at the riad are friendly and helpful.the fact we payed £75 for three nights was fantasic value for money.Essaouira is lovely and this riad was perfect for our short stay.Would recomend this riad to anyone travelling on a tight budget but like to be in the heart of things.,Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 July 2010,2,Only ok for the price,"The Riad Le Grand Large is well located at the centre of the Medina in Essaouira. When we arrived, the woman on the reception told us that the riad was full. We informed her that we have booked a double room. At the end and after a discussion, she recognized that she had an empty room for us. It has a cheap price (around 37€), so you cannot expect something extraordinary. The size of the room (double room) is OK but it is not very clean. There was only one towel (dirty) in the toilet even though we were two people. The bed was ok but the pillow was too big and hard and the shroud had a blood stain. The woman on the reception left us a computer to connect to Internet and inform us about the availability for the Supratours buses. Conclusion: it is ok for the price",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 June 2010,5,perfect stay in Essaouira,"My partner and I stayed for three nights at this riad as part of our week long holiday to morocco.We arrived from the chaos of Marrakech to a haven of relaxation.The Riad is on one of the main streets in Essaouira.Everything is within a five min walk.The staff where very friendly even offering us the chance to join them for lunch,which was the tastiest looking tagine I'd seen . breakfast on the terrace was lovely,a perfect way to start our day.There are many places to eat near by .The whole town has a very relaxed vibe about it.We were very sad leave .Next time I visit Morocco I'll make sure it's Essaouira I spend my time in and this riad to stay in....just lovely",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 March 2010,3,"Good location, basic B and B, friendly 'laid well back' staff.","In one of the main pedestrian (plus cycles, donkeys) very narrow shopping streets running across the town to the sea, with main entrances to the town at each end. Riad on three floors (plus roof terrace) with rooms around a central large square inner light air well. Roof terrace pleasant and small, nice for breakfast. We had demi-pension which was a mistake given the choice of nearby places to eat out elsewhere. Room fine, bright with view along the street., but only one upright chair. Beds a bit too firm for us. Bathroom fine. Staff friendly but 'learning'. Had to be prompted for a receipt. Visa system was down. Pay the night before you leave! Essaouira is about 3.3 hours by coach from Makkesch. Scenery en route not absorbing. Interesting place for a two night…",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 May 2009,4,"Very welcoming, in the heart of the medina","This riad is in the medina and right in the heart of the souks (shops), so it is well placed if you like to be in the middle of the action, and handy for a variety of restaurants, cafes etc! Also, it is only a couple of metres off a main street - which was especially beneficial at night - there being no need to walk down alleyways to reach your riad, as can be the case with some. The staff on reception were all very welcoming, friendly and helpful, some speaking English well, but also being tolerant of my limited French! This kindness has extended beyond our stay with their liaising with the restaurant where we left our camera on our last night (we realized once over an hour away, en route to the airport), collecting it, then sending it back to us in England! Our room was quite…",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
 April 2007,4,Really nice Riad in town centre,"It's a really nice hotel, very friendly staff. Beautiful decoration, perfect location. double room with private bathroom and nice views, very clean, for 49€ per night. I know it's a lot for being Marroco, but you would be surprised how much the prizes have raised, and it was absolutely worthwile. you can have breakfast on their nice top roof, sunbathing. I strongly recommend it.",Riad_Le_Grand_Large,Essaouira
