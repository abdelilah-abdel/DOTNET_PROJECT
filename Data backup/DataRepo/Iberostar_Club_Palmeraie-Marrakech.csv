 December 2022,5,A really successful vacation,"I spent a wonderful week in this hotel at the end of December and the beginning of January. The facilities in the hotel are very good, the staff are friendly, the food is varied and of very good quality. The entertainment programs were very good, the team of entertainers being made up of true professionals. The New Year's Eve was fantastic: the entertainment program was very good, the food was exceptional, and the atmosphere created was a dream.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 December 2022,5,"Excellent staff, fantastic stay!","The experience here was absolutely amazing. From the moment we got there, the staff were very welcoming. Checking in was straightforward and done whilst they served us some very lovely Moroccan tea. The grounds are just phenomenal! The staff at Iberostar are a HUGE asset to this organisation. They had such a large variety of food to choose from. The activities were fantastic, the children thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The only things perhaps they need to work on is their email and telephone communication. We tried to organise an event prior to going to the hotel and getting through to someone either via email or telephone was a nightmare. No response! Having said that, I thoroughly recommend this hotel and will have absolutely no issues returning!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,Happy to come back soon,Everything really nice! I would highly recommend and come back. Everything really nice and great service.

 December 2022,5,Amazing stay!,"Me and my partner visited in December and it was a pleasant stay, the staff really make you feel welcome, the entertainment team are great, always remember your name and always say hello, the room was great and spacious and was always cleaned to a high standard, there is plenty to do with various activities through the day and different competitions. The food was okay for all inclusive standards, only thing I would say is not enough meat options on the cookers expect a lot of fish and occasionally chicken, there is a restaurant where you have to book to get a dining experience but for me it wasn’t that great, I’d rather eat in the inclusive restaurant. We have booked again to visit next year and we’re already looking forward to it, I can’t thank the staff enough for making us…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2022,1,An honest in-depth review- please read if considering this hotel,"My husband and I are Iberostar club members and have visited multiple other Iberostar hotels in Mexico, DR, and Portugal, all with good experiences. I have also visited over 30 countries and traveled to many types of hotels. We stayed at this hotel to explore Marrakech and also have a relaxing stay, but had a very negative experience beyond what I expected. First of all, I would like to be fair and mention that I think this hotel in general just is not the best for young couples like ourselves. The guests mostly consist of French families, and the hotel caterers for them- there are multiple activities for children and there were very few adults traveling without children. They have a trapeze class which is very unique and three different pools. Regardless I would not come back…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Food is very good, a lot of variety , lot of heathy options, show cooking as well. There are heathy options for the drinks as well. Evening entertainment was good.Hotel is built on nice grounds and it is well maintained. Free shuttle bus into town. I will give everything apart from the rooms 5 out of 5. Rooms are spacious and well maintained but it is on its way to been dated. Overall if I was to go back to Marrakesh I will look no further .",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,A WONDERFUL OASIS IN MARRAKECH,"In fifty years of serious traveling, to all parts of the world, it has come to my attention that the main difference between hotels, comes down to the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. The Iberostar Club Palmerie Hotel does not disappoint. From the General Manager on down, everyone has one goal in mind, and that is to provide a first class experience for their guests. A customer service team that is the equal of any luxury hotel. Upon arrival, we were met by the Bellman who secured our luggage, ushered us into the lobby and provided a refreshing drink. Check in was accomplished in under 5 minutes by Mr. Muhammad Ali and the front desk staff. Throughout our stay he went out of his way to ensure our every need was met, and our room selection satisfactory. Muhammad…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2022,5,Great holiday,Great hotel and great people. Hotel staff hardworking and it is spotless. Thank you Emma (entertainment team) and ishmail bar waiter for being so helpful and friendly.

Loads to do and weather December mid 20s only had a bit of rain at night. We had room 2031 which was on ground floor and was very comfortable enormous bed Regret not doing the trapeze but deffo try it next time.

 December 2022,5,100% FAB-U-LOUS,"We have just returned from a holiday here at this hotel. I can honestly say the hotel is a fantastic place to stay. The staff are so incredibly friendly and absolutely nothing is too much trouble It’s a very well run hotel, immaculately kept and absolutely spotlessly clean, the food is truly amazing, such a choice of dishes, everything made from the freshest of ingredients and always something for all tastes The gardens are beautiful and really well tended, a few seats dotted around would be really nice for people wishing to have a quiet moment amongst the trees and birdlife? The pools are heated, which is great at this time of year. We particularly enjoyed the adult only pool which was really tranquil, yet having its own bar. We loved this place so much we are thinking…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Fantastic family holiday,"Amazing family holiday the stay has been fantastic entertainment team Emma looked after us every day and took care of all our needs she even teached us some Arabic phrases.

 November 2022,5,Wonderful and faultless hotel,"I have stayed at other Iberostar hotels in the Caribbean and have never been disappointed. This was no different. Staff are fantastic, go out of their way to please and make your stay special. They really make you feel like you are on a luxury holiday. Food was brilliant, always something different and the quality was fantastic. Yes the scrambled egg wasn’t piping hot but it was more than edible and there is microwaves if you need it hotter. Lots of choices for all meals, and with different bars offering snacks between the main meal times, you are never going to go hungry. Main pool area music was a bit intrusive but not offensive and the zen pool area was great, never had a problem getting a sun bed, some people were reserving them with towels but it wasn’t necessary at this…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,4,Loved the cats,"I’m leaving this hotel shortly after five days. I’ll do some good and bad points. Good: the food is excellent, extensive and well cooked and presented. I’d say it’s faultless apart from one thing (see bad section). The animals: I chose this hotel because I read on TA there were cats here and I love animals. I brought them some treats from home but then read the welcome sheet from the hotel which said not to feed them. If guests don’t feed them who looks after them? They are lovely so I ignored the request and fed them daily. There are peahens and geese too. Loved them all. I’d return just for them. The staff: nearly all were smiling, helpful all the time. The pools: They are heated. Not to be hot or warm but to a temperature that is perfect. Generally I hate pools as think…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Very pleasantly surprised. Would return,"Initially I’m struggling to understand so many of the negative points raised here about this hotel. Whilst I appreciate a lot of a stay can be portioned down to fortunate timing we had an exceptional week. The food in the main buffet surpasses any expectations I could have had when booking. Variety of food from traditional moroccan, to well made Pizza and fries if you so desire. Bbq and hot plate cookery was always a treat, where often there’s fish being made at lunch. Dessert pastries are exceptional at both lunch and dinner. Admittedly the buffet restaurant exceeded the “table service” restaurant which you visit once during your stay, this night was in fact the low light of the trip. Not down to the food, but the staff were often inattentive - perhaps we had a bad night.…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Great Staff great food lovely pool,"When we first arrived we were not 100% sure we had made the right decision. Everything was very french orientated but within a day the staff had made us feel so welcome, La Cost, Emma, Omi, Periss, Achaf and Momo, Abdul and all the other staff whos names I don't know, made us feel so welcome. The food was great, pool was lovely, the staff could not do enough for us. The bar staff, cleaners, caterers nothing was too much to ask.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 November 2022,4,"Fabulous hotel , lovely holiday","I write this review, sitting by the pool on our last full day ! I’m here with my husband- we left the kids at home for our first trip in 7 years child free - we wanted winter sun and a good quality all inclusive hotel and we definitely got both! The weather for the end of November is amazing - cool in the morning and evening - 11-5 pm glorious and about 23-26 degrees. My husband is a travel consultant and with his job we have travelled the world staying in many 4-5 and 5 star plus hotels , so it’s from that experience I write this review . Firstly I have to address the review that said they waited 4 hours to get through customs- it took us 20 mins….

 November 2022,4,Great hotel but could improve a few small things.,"Have just returned yesterday from my third visit to the Iberostar Club Palmeraie and look forward to visiting again next March. The weather in early November and in March is excellent, especially for us from a north of Europr. Mostly what I have to say about the hotel is EXCELLENT. It is as clean as whistle; the staff are friendly and efficient; the gardens are lovely and very extensive; two pools are superb plus there's a dedicated kids pool. Food was buffet style and there were changes every day; the Moroccan food offering was excellent but most of the buffet was international and extensive. I do have two down-sides but not enough to put me off returning. 1. The main dining room lacks character....badly. It is very brightly lit and is a bit ""canteen-ish"". It needs better ,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Marrakech masterclass in hospitality,"The staff make this hotel what it it is. Always smiling always willing to help or advise so thank you from the reception staff to the restaurant staff to the pool staff to the bar staff etc. You are a credit to the hotel. We loved the extensive grounds with 3 great pools, extensive sports facilities and food and bar stations. The main restaurants were good a little more food signage and hotter food might be suggested but the quality was great. Entertainment was pretty much the same team each night with different themes, it was very professional maybe a little variation needed. The guitarist one night in the restaurant was simply outstanding they should use him more. Lots of tours to go on and we did the City and Atlas Mountain both very good. My wife and i have to…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Our second visit in 2022 and still highly recommended .We will be back soon!,"This is the second time we have visited this hotel. We highly recommend it. From our greeting in reception from lovely Nabil, who was still smiling despite being very busy at that time, to the professionalism and efficiency of manager Mohammed this really wonderful hotel. The food is amazing, my husband eats like a king for the week and is then very miserable when he comes home to normal food! The staff clearing the tables are fantastic It genuinely feels like a restaurant which can be challenging catering for high numbers. When I booked I did not have a choice of rooms. I emailed and we were changed to a garden view room as when we visited the first time we found that the double pool view room was too noisy for us (without young children) and the garden view rooms are…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 October 2022,3,OK,"Very friendly staff, clean rooms, good bed, and decent breakfast. Everything was OK, but the food served in the buffet was a bit tasteless, and a lot of the food had a Moroccan ""stable"" smell. After all, certainly a good option for families with children. A free shuttle bus to Medina is a big plus!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Fantastic staff and beautifully maintained,"This hotel is fantastic and made even better by the amazing and plentiful staff! It is spotlessly clean and well maintained.

 November 2022,4,A relaxing stay and would return. Few improvements would help,"Overall we had a great stay and would return again. We were met by welcoming staff and shown to connecting rooms as requested. The adult only pool was extremely relaxing and comfortable with plenty of space to relax. Lots of entertainment and the archery instructor was sassy and fun while helping us. We liked him a lot! Food was all fresh and tasty, albeit sometimes a little cold. Bars were well stocked and there was an enthusiastic evening entertainment team. While a little outside the city it was easy to travel when needed. However, also offered an oasis of calm for a very relaxed trip. Cabs always outside. Very cheap late checkout also available which was very welcome. Few areas of improvement: 1) Doors to the room and connecting doors aren’t soundproof at all and so…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Exceeded Expectations,"The hotel is lovely. The grounds are so well maintained, the pools and facilities are great. The drinks are perfect, with lovely coffee, G&Ts, great cocktails (espresso martinis, mojitos or even Abdou's specials). There are even peacocks strolling around the grounds. Food was brilliant, with plenty of choice. There is a section for pizzas and pastas, for people who want some home comforts. They do different specials each day ranging from savoury crepes to kebabs. There is also a BBQ outside which changed each day. The staff are brilliant, from the waiters and bar staff to the spa staff. Plus Hassan as a golf instructor and you can't praise the entertainment staff enough - Emma, Lacoste, Perris and Oumi. They do whatever they can to make your holiday extra special.

 November 2022,4,"good experience, can improve in some areas","I have visited all 3 spanish branded All inclusive resorts in Marrakech, this is the better one, here is why - staff is excellent, friendly, experienced and genuinely helpful - Food: pretty diversified, missing some healthy options that can be labeled, deserts quality is poorest among the 3 resorts, the afternoon snacks were limited and of no diversity, i'd rank them below par compared to others - Kids Club: staff and outside activity are good enough, kids like them. the kids club needs some on premise upgrade with kids games... - shows and entertainment : best of all 3 resorts by far. missing some sports tournament to create some camaraderie and challenges - rooms: old and need revamp, the noise in corridors is extremely problematic because corridor noise echoes and you hear…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Great Stay,"Just returned from Marrakech, Hotel was great - I think the reviews are unfair - the hotel is an older hotel, but our room an surrounding areas were always very clean. Pools were great - the Zen pool is very quiet but the main pool was lively but not too loud. Morocco's 2nd language is French and this is spoken mostly but most of the staff can speak English and are very helpful - Shout out to Lacoste who was great fun - all the activity staff work really hard. The food is OK - much like most All Inclusive buffets - always something to choose from - my one complaint is that the food needs to be labelled better, my son is allergic to nuts and we were unsure a) what we were eating and b) what contained nuts - this needs to improve. We had a great week - weather was glorious -…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Highly recommend,"We have just come back from a week at the Iberostar Palmeraie with my family, we were 7, including one grandchild of 9. The hotel is the ideal place for this sort of holiday, but also for a quiet break as a couple. The two heated pools, one quiet and one with entertainment, mainly for French people who like that sort of thing are excellent. I cannot prise the staff enough, Sara and Mohammed Ali in the lobby, Rachida and Bouchra in the dinning room, Samir at the pool, and many more. All so kind and helpful. My son had an accident and needed hospital treatment and they were amazing. The all inclusive is really all inclusive, the food in the restaurant is superb, the choice endless, with grilled meats, salads, vegetables all of excellent quality, and the desserts are scrumptious.…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Special thank yous to the guys running the waterpolo and aqua aerobics and Emma for being so welcoming to us all. Management were visible and really maintained high standards. Paella cooking course was much appreciated. Dancers were hard-working and very talented. Highly recommended!,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2022,3,Nice stay,"Stayed here in October half term. Lovely clean hotel and excellent staff. We didn’t do our homework and unfortunately the hotel was packed with French and the hotel catered entirely for the French. The entertainment was not great and the hotels very remote not that there’s bars restaurants etc to go to, it’s a very different holiday experience. The food was ok, fresh but very boring. If you are thinking about going to Morocco be prepared for a 2 to 3 hour wait to get through their customs and immigration control. Absolutely diabolical with border staff really not bothered and basically wasting everyone’s time watching you tube clips and having a laugh with the other staff. There’s also a hour to get through the customs on departure also!! Personally I won’t return to Morocco.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Would recommend!,"Fantastic stay at the Iberostar! Staff fantastic - always had a smile and would help you with anything. Food very well presented and good quality although would like to see some labels on the food in the buffet for allergy reasons. Hotel is spotless, the grounds are absolutely immaculate, rooms cleaned to a very high standard. Pool areas lovely and enjoyed the house wine and beer, also the fizzy drinks were very good. I cannot complain for the price at all! It may be a bit out of the city centre but I found Palmeraie to be much more relaxing then the city, we went to the YSL museum in a taxi for less then £25 return and the Souks near the main square for £30. Very good weather in last week of October aswell 35 degrees most days.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The food was very nice, fresh, tasty and varied everyday. The entertainment team are amazing. The grounds are immaculately clean and makes you want to walk round all the time. The facilities are great too and activities always going on at different times of the day. The cocktail party was lovely.

The adults-only Zen pool and bar is a haven of tranquility. The hotel is a set in several acres of gardens which are surprisingly green and attractive. Comfortable rooms with lovely garden views, and the surprise flowers on the bed were a nice touch. The gym is much larger than we expected and very well equipped with new machines.

The grounds are immaculate and the staff work herd every day to keep it this way. There some resident cats and kittens and they are very clean, well looked after and friendly. Everyone loved them. The rooms were great. Spacious and clean. Housekeeping went in every day and sometimes left rose petal designs on the bed. Nice touch. The shower was always hot and had good pressure. There were a few mosquitos when we arrived but we asked reception if someone could spray the rooms, which they did straight away. We only went to the aduts only pool but it was great.

We were sent off to the restaurant so we could have lunch before it closed and returned to find ourselves all checked in. Rooms - OK, nothing spectacular but cleaned everyday to a high standard. Water pressure wasn't great! Food - reasonable. We are something different most days. It's not the hottest but there is a microwave which we used. The foot truck burgers were great!

We arrived last night having booked in good faith via BA Holidays, after reading all the ‘wonderful’ reviews on trip advisor, and simply cannot now understand how the hotel can attract so many five star reviews when it falls so short on every level. To summarise: In no way whatsoever is this place ‘4 Star’ Receptions smells of bleach All other communal areas smell of smoke Decor generally very old and tatty No staff on hand outside to welcome you / help you with bags when you finally arrive (location is in the middle of nowhere) Staff are only polite if you tip them, our ‘bellboy’ insisted on bringing our bags up to the room in the very old lift, and had obviously just been out for a cigarette as reeked of smoke.

 May 2022,4,Great Holiday,We arrived on 07.05.2022 for a 14 day holiday. After a short taxi transfer from the airport we were the only people checking in. Although check-in wasn’t until 15.00 they managed to get our room ready by 13.00. We were given our room number and set off to find it. Our luggage arrived shortly after. The room was a good size with a bathroom and a very small balcony with a table and chairs overlooking the gardens. The beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning coped very well with temperatures hitting 40 degrees. The cleaner did a fantastic job all through our stay and even left towels and toilet rolls outside the room if we were having a break from the sun. There was plenty of wardrobe space to hang all of our clothes which can normally be a problem. The only thing…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2021,4,Family break,"Welcome : A party of 13 of us arrived at the hotel and were warmly welcomed with a drink. We were seated in reception while the staff did the necessities to have us checked in. There was a misunderstanding the hotel vouchers and it ended up taking a long time to sort out but once sorted, the manager did all he could to make our stay seamless. Buffet restaurant : The chef does a good job of being creative with the dishes. There’s award something for everyone from salads, fish, chicken and red meat dishes as wall as the tagine of course. Moroccan restaurant: Spa : We had a range of massages and hammam treatments and although we weren’t blown away as they lack the finesse, we were all happy with the treatments.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2022,5,Hassan will be watching,"To be honest we picked this hotel because it was in the Iberostar group and we've had many happy holidays in Cuba and Crete so we knew what to expect with the quality of food and accommodation generally. The icing on the cake was the daily Golf lesson with Hassan - all part of the Animation programme. This was excellent. We had one to one attention and it certainly has made us think more about our game. We are both fairly new to the game but have tried to keep up a weekly 9 hole practice. When we attempt a shot we say ""Hassan will be watching"" or ""Hassan will be proud"" when it goes well. Only slight criticism is the lack of labelling of food or a general menu which could be put on the entrances to the restaurant. This would be particularly useful around the show cooking. …",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2022,2,Great place for weight loss!,"Where to start with this one…. Check in was simple and staff were helpful informed me my poolside room would be ready in one hour, gave me the wrist bands to get food/drink use facilities etc and all seemed great. Poolside seemed fun and the animation team were friendly and helpful, the trapeze is brilliant and my daughter loved it instantly, nice addition. The gardens are very well kept and everything on the outside of the building is great. Except the food truck, the quality of food I couldn’t comment on as after watching the flies crawl over it all I decided to swerve it. Drinks were poor, but there are other better bars so no big deal. First impressions were excellant. From there it all went downhill….. pool side room was a nightmare, if I strained my neck and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2022,4,Beautiful place,Was pleasantly surprised how good this place was. The staff are super friendly. The grounds are lovely very well kept. Very clean . Food was good . I’d definitely go back and met people who have been back many times,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2022,4,Good service,"The hotel staff were friendly but the buffet food was luke warm, would wait for more food to be freshly cooked and the Moroccan restaurant was not worth it. One waiter who did not speak english and was not traditional food. There were a lot of french staying there that smoked (a lot) even whilst we were eating. Not pleasant and the compare spoke mostly in french. We had a nice relaxing time around the Zen pool but a five days was enough. The rooms were clean but fairly basic (not enough hangers)",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Excellent hotel,"The hotel is excellant ! The food is very good , the staff is friendly and know how to make you feel good.

 September 2022,3,50/50,"This is a really mixed review. I don’t think this hotel is worth the money. The food was terrible and I ended up with campylobacter and have been sick for 2 weeks! The activities are amazing though , I loved the Archery, Trapeze and spin. The entertainment team are mostly really nice, especially Abdo, Morad, Achraf and Hocine and they really want you to have a good time. The waiters are also lovely. They had a good couple of entertainment evenings and the white party was the best..Morad in the fire show was amazing. The director of the hotel was very welcoming but the reception staff were just rude. The room was nice and very big but not the cleanest. If I could just go back for the activities pool and people I would but not worth the food poisoning!!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2022,5,Excellent stay,"We once again had an excellent stay for the 8th time, first I would like to thank all the staff of the hotel without exception for their excellent service, generosity and their permanent smile, it must be said that from year to year the hotel always keeps its elite place for us, in terms of hygiene service listening sympathy you are at the top, but I would like to particularly thank again Mr. oualid the hotel manager for his dedication and professionalism, the beautiful sarah and mohamed ali for their hospitality, helpfulness and sense of listening, thank you for always being there, I also thank our dear zakaria at the reservations department for his kindness and his professionalism and warm welcome, I wish you a good continuation I have not seen better than you I assure you,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 September 2022,4,Great for a short 3-4 stay to relax,"The hotel facilities and staff where were very friendly and helpful, but tipping and thanking definitely helped better service. Lots of activities to keep you busy. The selection of food in the buffet was very good but some was cold. The traditional morrocian restaurant you get one night of your stay was very slow service and basic at best. Alot of people smoke and have no concideration for people that don't especially around the pool and outdoor eating areas. The bar selection is good and the drinks are nice but all bars close at 12am with no option of a late drink as town is 25 minutes in a taxi",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2022,5,Fantastic stay,"Absolutely brilliant. Facilities, staff and rooms all fantastic. Staff were so happy to help those who needed it and I saw them rushing to help anyone who wanted anything. We were very pleased with the attention given by the general manager who was always out and about making sure everything was up to standard. Food was very good and even when busy queues were minimal. The outside seating was a lovely escape from the noise of the communal eating hall. Waiter service was excellent for drinks etc and once our order was ‘known’ we were often brought drinks by regular waiters from different stations (6 beers for 2 of us!) Will definitely return!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2022,1,Do yourself a favour and stay in a riad. Avoid this place at all costs.,"After a day of staying at this resort i was really wondering how this place has so many 5 stars reviews and it seemed weird that everyone mentions the names of particular staff members, when people usually write reviews they usually just write staff were great not particular names, right? But I ended up finding out on the second day that staff come around and ask you to write a review and say to mention there name on it, you even get credits for writing a positive review. Bribing some may call this? We have been in Marrakesh for a week before coming here and our riad before here had way better service and was so much cleaner, nicer and more authentic then this place. From the start this place was a let down: The reception staff on check in, ran quickly through the paperwork…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2022,4,A great place to stay for a week in the sun.,"Arrived and greeted with a nice drink and early check in which set the standard for a good holiday. The room was spacious, comfy, good AC, tv with a range of channels and a nice bathroom. Whilst relatively small, the balcony offered a nice view into the gardens and the sunset could be seen behind the buildings. 3 good pools with plenty of beds, no early rush and plenty of options. Food was a good standard but repetitive, although they did offer theme nights which was nice. However we personally felt that breakfast wasn't the best, but did enjoy the pastries.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2022,5,Fantastic holiday,"I was convinced by previous reviews stating great staff and lovely food when booking and wasn’t disappointed! Good sized clean and comfortable rooms, although we didn’t get any toiletries until half way through our holiday. Probably the friendliest team of staff I’ve ever come across - from management, bar staff, reception and cleaners, everyone we met was cheery and friendly. There is constant cleaning, maintenance and gardening going on but it’s not intrusive on your holiday the gardens are amazing. Food selection is varied & delicious - lots of stations every meal time where they are freshly cooking food for you; some things are the same each day, but there are also new things to try for variety - including roast beef on Sunday! Entertainment is there if you want it - we…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2022,5,Great experience!,"Very good hotel, everything from the staff to the beds and pillows were spot on. Enough sunbeds for everyone. Food very good, they try and cater for many different nationalities. 2 very minor points, salt and pepper should be out in buffet restaurant for every serving and could do with some small drinks tables up on stage area as nowhere to put glasses. Other than that really enjoyed it and will be back.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,Just do it and go and enjoy the experience of this hotel and Marrakech,"Having reviewed many of the reviews of the hotel and Marrakech prior to going, I was a little unsure of what to expect. Don't read any of them expect this one and the positive ones. Having spent a week at the Iberostar I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Arrived earlier than the check in time due to the time of the flight, welcomed with a drink and an expected time of when the room would be ready (1 hour). Able to use all the facilities and start the holiday straight away whilst we waited for the room. In essence I have read reviews stating that the French guests are favoured above the English or other nationalities, I can assure you this is not the case. All the staff treated everyone equally and with a smile. Reviews about the lack of variety of food, don’t worry about…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2022,5,Amazing holiday,"This holiday to Marrakesh has been absolutely wonderful. From the minute you arrive, the staff are so friendly and do everything for you. The view from our room wasn't the best and so we asked if there were any other available rooms, and without any fuss or hassle, we were upgraded. The staff at Iberostar are amazing. They work so hard and nothing is ever too much to ask. They always serve you with a smile and are so very attentive. Everybody from the cleaners, the ground keepers, the food truck staff, the entertainment team, the restaurant staff - I really can't fault them! The gardens, pool areas and rooms are immaculate and cleaned every day. The maids put out fresh towels each day. The restaurant is wonderful and accommodates for all types of eaters.

I already say that I recommend it and that I will definitely return to this country and it will be in this resort that I will stay. We arrived long before check-in time, around 9:30 am and the first concern they had with me and the family and we were 9 people, was immediately and before anything else, they sent us to breakfast so that we could eat something, extraordinary Mohamed (maletero). the Staff is awesome, they make us feel really special and very well treated, from Zacharias at the reception, to Yussef and Mohamed at the bar, but who we really became friends with was Ashram and Elhocine, from the pool towels. Very friendly and smiling guys, in general, like all the hotel staff. The facilities are excellent, with comfortable rooms,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We arrived long before we could check in, tired from the trip and without eating. Without asking for anything, we were immediately told that we would have breakfast while the rooms were prepared. We realized right there that the stage was going to go well! Super clean and well maintained hotel. The food is good and there is a lot of variety and the hotel takes care of having a grill with different meats every day. It's really good. Super nice and well maintained spaces. Three pools, one more confusing and always partying, one for children and then the Zen one that was the most used for us and where we can relax with lots of mojitos!…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Room for 3 of us was maybe smaller than we expected but really clean and totally functional! The lady who cleaned it daily was just lovely! Around the pool (activity pool) we could not fault Ismail...he bought drinks, was happy, chatted and was a true credit to the hotel... The activity schedule was full on! We didn't use it much but there really was something for everyone! At night the show time was always there but again we chose to get then sit Olin the outside bar area...Mohammed and Samir were fantastic!! Food was always lovely ..fresh and nasty!

 August 2022,2,Not good for young couples,"My boyfriend and I have just returned for a week visit and our overall experience was ok. I do not recommend this hotel to younger couples who want a proper dining and night life experience. We did try the on site restaurant one night and were left unimpressed, the food was not nice and made me feel unwell. Overall, the food was ok and the hotel was quite clean it just wasn’t the experience I was hoping.

It was spotlessly clean , cleanest rooms I’ve ever stayed in, shampoo, conditioner & hand gels all provided plus big nice pool towels , plenty of sun beds so no need to get up at the crack of dawn and race to get one which is nice . Food & drinks were lovely and plentiful , the staff very friendly and helpful. Maoud, Ismail and.the rest of the gang from the entertainments team were so friendly and always made a point of coming over to say hello and knew everyones names .

The complex is top notch and the staff really can't do enough for you. The food was wonderful if you try it. Why would you come to Morocco and eat pizza and chips? Not many Brits which was a bonus although the people we met were lovely. Lots to do if you wish or just chill with a strong cocktail! We visited the Medina x3. Great experience and the people were friendly. Expect to be invited into every shop but it was fun and if you don't want just be polite. Medina at night is a must. Don't be scared its wonderful.

The food was lovely and plentiful with lots of choices even for fussy eaters. There is a grilled bbq every evening. We really enjoyed the cocktails, try the mojitos the best we have ever drank. There is a free shuttle bus which goes to the centre of Marrakech it takes about 20 minutes. Do take your own beach towels if you can, you can borrow some from the hotel with a deposit however everyone has the same towel so easy to lose. There is a varied activity programme if you want to do activities. Beautiful luscious green grounds. The rooms were very nice and large with balconies. You can purchase tours at reception but I wouldn’t recommend the half day trip to…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,Nice resort outside of Marrakech,"This hotel was very nice, the staff was tremendously kind and helpful. It's a bit far from the city, but they have shuttles periodically throughout the day to take you into and out of the town. You can also take a taxi, but it's a bit expensive since it's out of their way a lot. There's not quite enough seating by the pools, so you have to work hard to find a place to sit. Most people will claim a spot in the morning and leave their stuff there all day so they have seats if they return. The food was pretty good overall -- they had a lot of options for all meals. (Their pastries weren't very good, unfortunately.) They have a lot of activities for people to do, and their spa is very nice. The service is really great and they were so welcoming.

The family pool was busy but we always managed to get sun beds and even when we visited the Zen pool there would be sun beds available, if not the staff would try and find you one.

Saw young staff sitting chatting and playing cards with elderly people on their own which was lovely. If you go into Marrakesh ask the man on the bus to get you a guide when you get there as otherwise people approach you. The hotel has three pools - adult only was perfect. Food very good.

Lifeguard does enforce the rule and keeps the peace! Ajoub kept our drinks topped up from the Zen bar and he made us laugh a lot!! We missed him on his day off. Entertainment was busy!

We didn’t use our balcony at all as there were these large ‘paper wasps’ which were very scary lol. We had a garden view so maybe this is why we had that problem.

The only thing lacking and the only reason it is not a 5 star review is the entertainment of an evening which could do with some live music or variety. The stars are everyone who works so hard to make your holiday. The cleaners who keep the rooms absolutely spotless, the animations team who work flat out to ensure everyone has a good time.

Rooms were clean and well looked after by the cleaning team. Food was very good with lots of choice. Activities were varied and appeared well run. The zen pool was a particular highlight, as was the quiet eating areas outdoors which allowed respite from the hideous noise level in the canteen each meal time. A few areas for improvement: We paid extra for an Atlas Mountain view but in fact received a room with no mountain view whatsoever. So definitely worth checking you have received what you paid for. In addition, the air conditioning in our room was very substandard. We did not sleep at all for the first night and had to resort to covering ourselves in wet towels.

This hotel deserves more than a 10/10 review. Genuinely cannot find a single negative thing to say about the hotel. The staff- the staff MAKE this hotel. The entertainment team is SPECTACULAR. They work SO HARD every day to make sure everyone had an amazing day by the pool, aqua Zumba daily and water polo! Both of which we loved…I special mention to Mouad , Piris, Abdou all of who made our days by the pool special and were ever so approachable to ask questions! Nabil on reception was amazing! Thankyou for constantly sorting my room key and printing our return boarding passes! Keep up the hard work guys!!! 🎉🎉🎉 The cleaning staff- they are a credit to the hotel.…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2022,3,Was okay but could’ve been better.,"This would’ve been possibly a 4/5 star but there was a lot more room for improvement. Majority of staff were brilliant and assertive, but some of them don’t seem too bothered, I understand there is a language barrier as English isn’t a common language for them to speak but the facial expressions from some of staff when you ask for things was disappointing and made you feel uncomfortable to ask. But massive shout out to Abdel Aziz from the main restaurant, always managed to put a smile our face, reserved us a table every night at dinner as we always struggled to find somewhere to sit and always got our drinks + refilled them. It wasn’t only us either, he made sure everyone in his section was looked after and went the extra mile for everyone, even to the point where he took…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2022,5,Amazing stay,"We enjoyed everything here. We were placed into a room with a pool view, although this can be a bit noisy in the day it did not effect our evenings/nights. The rooms are pretty basic but do have shower gel, shampoo and conditioner provided. There was also a fridge in the room which we stored our after sun and bottled water from the bar in to keep nice and cold. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. Most staff spoke great English and those that didn’t with a bit of French from our side got our points across. All the activities are made with adults and children in mind - we were very surprised to find for example the 10-11 golf was a full hour golf instruction in a net with full sized clubs and balls. We took advantage of the hotel change up of money however they only…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2022,5,Paradise in the Palmeraie,Had an amazing 2 weeks here in Jun/Jul 2022. The holiday got off to the perfect start when the standard room was upgraded to a suite! Thank you to Zakaria for that. Room was spotless - as were the 2 bathrooms and balcony. And some great views of the mountains in the distance. The best thing about this hotel was the staff. At the main reception Nabil was always a helpful smiling presence. Everyone in the restaurant was amazing but special thanks to Leila and Taki who were just superb (they were missed on any day they weren’t there). The bar staff were equally helpful - Yassine could make the perfect pre-dinner martini and then Mohammed would constantly be on hand to replenish drinks throughout the evening. During the daytime Ayoub in the Zen bar was superb as well! Tried a…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2022,4,Amazing place,We stayed 10 nights and loved the hotel even though it’s not what we usually go for. We normally like to go for walks around the area which isn’t possible here. The food was wonderful especially for me being veggie I often hav problems finding something other than salad. Lots of choice at all meals. The chief on food truck even made a salad rolls at lunch time as I didn’t want a real meal in restaurant most days. The bar and waiting staff were so helpful and rembered our drinks straight away. Especially Ishmal on the main pool. We tried the zen pool but found it to quiet and to hard to get a drink which wasn’t a problem with ishmal around on the main pool. The dancers and shows were amazing however we found the animation staff were not interested in us as we were English. Even…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2022,4,Would recommend,"We stayed at the Iberostar for a week in June. Approximately 30 minutes from the airport with a free shuttle into Marrkech, the three pools (main, adult and kids) catered for everyone. All the food and all inclusive drinks were good, and there was a lot of entertainment put on during the day with lots of sport, which was great. Special thanks to Bahir (pool/entertainment team) and Leila (restaurant team). Our flight was delayed, and although we didn't want dinner at midnight, we appreciated the hotel's offer of the restaurant cooking something for us with our late arrival. I tried a spa treatment (hammam and massage) and would happily have the hammam again.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2022,4,Good!,"The hotel is about a 25 minute drive from the airport. Upon arrival, check-in was efficient and was told to download the app which gave us the information about the hotel, timings for the restaurant, activities and map. This app came very handy when contacting reception regarding requests or complaints. Our room was away from the main building. Upon entrance of the building, the place was saturated in mosquitos. The room was spacious and clean but there were several mosquitoes in the room. We informed reception and they sent someone with a spray to kill them. This was a daily occurrence, mosquitos were let in daily by the cleaner. There are 3 pools (main, Children’s and the Adult only). The main pool had entertainment and music. We opted for the adult only pool which had…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2022,1,We were catfished - NOT 5 star,"Honestly have no idea how there’s not more 1* reviews, we must have arrived at the wrong hotel!! We stayed here for 5 nights and it was supposed to be a 5 star. We checked in to the below average room, the pictures make it look 100 times better than it is. Firstly the safe didn’t work so we had to hide our valuables. I couldn’t find an iron so I called reception to be told they don’t provide one. I asked why as you’re supposedly a 4 star hotel, they did eventually get me one from housekeeping, only after complaining , however this was severely damaged. The next morning we woke up and thought we would have a coffee. No kettle, or facilities to make tea or coffee. I then decided to go to the ‘gym’ and oh my god it’s a health and safety nightmare!!! Machines broken and just…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2022,5,A must visit hotel,The hotel was so clean and staff so incredibly helpful we were so surprised . I sadly had an accident prior to the trip and was on crutches but the hotel couldn’t have been more helpful lending a wheelchair and giving us ground floor accommodation . The food in the self service buffet was plentiful and hygiene was a top priority . There was constant entertainment around one of the pools ( there is a quiet pool as well ) and the staff in bars/ restaurants( Mohammed in restaurant ) /reception were very helpful but Piriss was exceptional - taking time everyday to talk to everyone around the pool in a variety of languages and answering any questions . We will certainly return and can highly recommend this hotel,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2022,5,"Amazing hotel, wonderful staff","I stayed here for 4 nights with my daughter and 13 year old granddaughter. From start to finish it was a wonderful break. The hotel and grounds are wonderful and the room was spacious and had everything we needed including a hairdryer and free safe. I must say that the staff and entertainment team are absolutely fantastic, they never stop and the nightly shows we're the best I've seen in any hotel. the champagne/cocktail party on one evening was amazing, unlimited champagne and cocktails as well as canapés and they even had a magician entertaining the guests. The drinks are good and very good measures and I loved the rose wine. Food in the buffet was plentiful and very fresh as was the moroccon restaurant. All the staff made us feel very welcome and from day one they…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2022,5,BEST HOTEL I HAVE STAYED AT,"All the staff members made my stay exceptional. I have travelled many countries and by far this is the best hotel I have been to. Everything was a 10/10 service down to the smallest details. Afew names I would like to mention are Katy, Sukki, Yassine, Mouad, Brahim, Abdou, Bouchra and there are many more! The bar staff and kitchen staff were amazing and so were the cleaners. The management is also outstanding. I will definitely be coming back and recommending to everybody else.

 June 2022,4,amazing holiday i was not expecting,"to begin with the check in was extremely smooth, they have a good exchange rate at the hotel which is handy and the staff at reception were very informative. We had a double room (no.1032) which was located just by the big pool. the AC never disappointing us and the room was cleaned thoroughly everyday. the kids pool was very fun for my two boys with all the added water squirting features. the kids room is for 4+ am afraid so did not use that. there are couple of bars pool side with a food truck (free if all inclusive) for daytime snacks. you get the occasional sight of peacocks and turtles roaming the resort and the friendly kittens looking for snacks. Food - was very traditional Moroccan style. i particularly liked the meat/Rib tagine with couscous. not a wide variety…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2022,5,Amazing week away at this hotel,"Girls holiday to somewhere hot, we couldn't have asked for a better place. Walking into the hotel lobby and it says it all. Beautifully decorated with a lovely smell that we wanted to bottle and bring home! The hotel was immaculate, and you would always see people hard at work to keep it that way. The food was varied for all tastes, always fresh and the staff in the dining room were always there to help if needed. Our days were spent around the pool where the snack bar staff and entertainment team would always have a smile on their face and would love a chat. This makes you feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. The evening entertainment was a bit repetitive. Different 'title' but generally the same dancers doing a different dance...apart from the karaoke…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Not realy 5 star luxury but for what you pay good value for the money. Our room was small but ok...air con not the best but it kept us just about cool enough. Mini bar empty except for water and no kettle in the room. I would return if I got a good deal in March but probably not in June...it was very hot.

 June 2022,5,The Vacation I didn't know I needed,"I stayed in mid-June for a week. I must say that I had the best vacation I have had in a long time. This location and staff exceeded my expectations by far. My first morning interaction was with Bader. I met him while walking to breakfast and he told me about the facilities and that he was there to make sure I enjoyed myself. He was also the Magician at the resort, so he made time in his schedule for us to teach each other a couple of tips and tricks. There were also a lot of activities throughout the day where I met others from the event staff. Katy was very nice and we got to talk and play Petanque, darts, water polo, and dance around the pool. She was very nice and easy to speak with. Mourad joined us at patanque and was a great teacher at the trapeze and archery. Always…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

You need to bring an iron. Toiletries are provided. Kids pool, quite pool and larger pool where the entertainment is. The staff work extremely hard to make sure you have the best time at the hotel, if you need anything they would make it their personal buisness to get it for you, drinks, food etc whilst your relaxing around the pool. I was bitten by a mosquito in the face and had an allergic reaction to it which resulted in one of my eyes closing ... just complete bad luck ! the management and staff were so amazing and the personal care i received to get me back to myself i really cannot thank everyone involved enough.

I have to say I have never stayed at a hotel that had so much going on, they have the balance of calm and fun in one hotel off to a tee. The staff are the best part of this hotel with 5* service, and going above and beyond any other hotel I have visited.

 June 2022,2,Left after 1 night,"I booked with BA holidays, arrived close to midnight due to the BA flight being delayed. The hotel receptionist spoke very little English, rattled off all the rules and gave me various information leaflets as well as wrist band. Went to the bar, had a drink before it closed. Went to my room, I paid a supplement for a view of the Atlas mountains...told next day that you never see them at this time of year due to the haze. Breakfast was a buffet affair, lots of choice but all the fruit juices were not fresh....made up from a powder ...awful. The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere and has not the slightest Moroccan atmosphere.

 June 2022,2,Not worth the value,"2 resturants - one is a buffet, this opens at 7pm but the food is sat there from at least 6:30, the food is all cold. Buffet doesnt sign what the food is, so if you want to know what you are eating try and ask but the chefs dont understand. Buffet serves a lot of fish - if you do not like fish avoid. 2nd resturant was a set Moroccon menu. websites state mini golf - there was no mini golf. nightclub is so hidden you will never find it with no sign posts. If you get a pool view room by the main pool, they play loud music around this pool all day and not very relaxing which you can hear from your room from pool opening to closing.

Initial impressions were excellent. Spotlessly clean reception including our room and the grounds are beautiful. The next morning we were able to get an idea of where things were.

The large grounds are kept immaculate and all the staff work very hard. You will jever go hungry as the restaurant had a great choice of food, all freshly prepared. There is also an adjoining Moroccan restaurant which you get the free use of once during your stay. There is a great lunch van which offered burgers etc in the afternoon before dinner. The only down side are the dated rooms which need refurbishing. Try and get a room with a balcony/ pool view if you can.

Special shout out to Bader who made us feel so welcome, and was clearly putting in a lot of effort throughout the entire day to make sure the guests were having fun. The food was outstanding, my partner is a chef and he was very impressed.

On the 6th day of our stay an incident could have ruined our holiday, though. To begin with, the staff were hospitable, friendly & cheerful namely Badr, Yassine, Eemy & to top it off ABDEL, the entertainer Chef. There is no doubt that the hotel Manager takes on only highly qualified employees. What's more, you can relish your holiday by playing trapeze, basket ball, volleyball, tennis along with other related sports facilities. The 3 swimming pools were clean and well maintained. A lifeguard was ensuring the safety of the swimmers.. On the 6th day, however, my elder daughter was bitten by a cat.

 June 2022,5,Excellent all round,"The service on this holiday was excellent, the staff, food ,service, cleanliness, facilities, genuine care and friendliness was above and beyond, Really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone. The only complaint was we used the free bus to go into the souks in Marrakech. On arrival we were approached by a tourist guide advising us to have a guide accompany us around the souks, As we were unsure of the way in a strange city we decided to have the guide accompany us as the tourist guide there said that we would only have to give him a couple of pounds 'his words'. He took us to the souks right enough but guided us to shops he was obviously known and would probably get a cut of whatever we spent. We felt we were ripped off and he never said anything.

A massive thank you to Bader and Ismail who both looked after all the guests around the pool...these guys did not stop, thank you. Also thank you to the guys from the Zen bar. Pools and grounds well maintained and cared for with an extra special guest....the resident peacocks. Sunbeds available all day!!! The only slight let down was the DJ in the nightclub who became a little rude and sharp with you when requesting a song. All in all an excellent hotel/holiday...definitely would return",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2022,4,Great hotel. Amazing entertainment.,"A family friendly hotel. The entertainment is great and a real strength for choosing this place. They have excellent staff on board - with a few particularly “stand out” members of staff who I feel I should mention! Such as their magician (called Pedro / Bader) who is excellent. Abdul the entertainment manager seems to be on a mission to please everyone - and succeeds! Also Zyad, Ismail and Samir who are part of the wait staff and can’t do enough to help everyone all the time with a smile for all. Also the dancers and childrens’ entertainers are all very good - and it’s certainly a welcoming place. There are multiple events and things to do, you won’t be bored! Tennis, volleyball, trapeze, archery etc etc. Lovely pools and great service. The food buffet has fabulous variety…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2022,5,Relaxing short break,"Our second visit to this wonderful hotel, the staff and facilities are superb. The Adults only pool is relaxing haven while the main pool is vibrant and more energetic. unfortunately this time we were given a room overlooking the pool and found it a bit noisy on a couple of Evenings. if you are looking for a bit more quiet then i would advise against a room looking over the pool.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2022,5,Brilliant,"Just returned from the palmeraie and I must say it is the most friendliest iberostar we have ever stayed at.A special mention to Ismall who looked after us around the pool and the whole of the food truck team.from the cleaners,waiters and bar staff they all took time to have a chat. The hotel is absolutely spotless and a large variety of food and drink on offer. Thanks again ismall for making this holiday unforgettable.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2022,5,A gem of a place,Holiday is coming to a close now so sitting by the pool I thought it time to leave a review of this hotel. First things first; there are many positives for this hotel but it is the people that makes this hotel what it is. Everybody was incredibly friendly and even though there are too many to name a special mention must go to Bader and Ismail who simply never stop working. The food is really varied and the sports facilities are superb although maybe the basketball hoops need some attention if I am being picky. The entertainment is also of a high standard with some good dance acts although we circumnavigated the karaoke as we cannot sing at all... As for trips out; we got the free hotel bus into the Souks and it was certainly an experience and one not to be missed really. Have…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2022,5,Great hotel with brilliant staff,"What a fabulous place with amazing staff, everyone made us feel very welcome and we would like to give an extra big thanks to Bader (entertainment staff) and Ismil and the chef (food truck) for looking after us every day and making us feel special, highly recommended.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2022,5,Fabulous Week away in Morocco,"My Family and I spent seven nights at the Iberostar club in Marrakesh. I must say that this is one of the best family holidays I and my family have ever had. The hotel is fantastic, the food is amazing and the people that work in this hotel absolutely go out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home. I would particularly like to say a huge thank you to Bader from the entertainments team who made us feel so welcome and his magic show is amazing. I’d also like to thank Ismil and the team at the food truck for keeping us in food and drink every day. We highly recommend this resort.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2022,5,Beautiful time in Marrakech,"Very first time visiting Marrakech and I have to say a very good first impression. Staff could not do more to be helpful, attentive and happy. Lots of activities to do throughout the day which the hotel staff actively get involved in and create a great atmosphere. Only couple of negatives would be children's food selection for lunch/dinner is isolated so kids may not eat everything on offer & the restaurant left alot to be desired as our booking was missing and you don't see a menu before you dine. Weather was really nice and plenty of hot weather to get a tan.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,5,An oasis of fabulousness,"We were bumped due to overbooking with less than 24 hours notice from the five star adults only Be Live Resort in Palmeraie to this Iberostar hotel and after we got over the shock and irritation, wow were we impressed. There really isn’t anything negative about this place. The staff are so friendly and go out of their way to help, the food is copious, fresh and ever changing and the facilities were second to none. A special shout out to the great rose wine! We spent our days relaxing by the chill pool where we could watch other guests trying the trapeze - yes they even have experienced instructors for those who want to try this sport. The grounds are huge and actually we commented that we could have done with a map of the facilities when we arrived. The rooms were spotless…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,4,Great family hotel set outside Marrakesh,"Club Palmarie is a sprawling low rise hotel set amidst acres of beautifully manicured tropical gardens. Built in traditional style with a real North African flavour, It has a feeling of space and peace against the dusty chaos of Marrakesh’s city streets. Location Club Palmarie is located in the Palmarie area of the city, around 20 -25 minutes from the central Medina area by car. This is probably it’s biggest drawback if you want to hop to the Medina fairly often. There is a complimentary hotel shuttle bus a few times a day and the last bus returns from the medina at 1030pm. A taxi costs 150 MAD. With the further away location though comes space which enables the hotel to have such beautiful grounds and facilities. Food An extensive array of dishes at both breakfast and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 April 2022,4,Relaxing holiday. Fabulous hotel.,"We have just returned from the Iberostar Club Palmeraie. From beginning to end we had a fab holiday. When I do a review I like to add a few tips to new travellers. I booked us a room with double pool view. We started to unpack (after checking in which was quick and easy, lovely staff) and then went for a walk around the grounds to have a look round. We saw the adults only pool which is where we were going to head now we have adult children! We went back to get ready and realised that the main pool was actually quite noisy. Enquired at reception if any other rooms were available and we were shown a 'garden room' which was at the other end of the complex close to the adults pool. It was peaceful and in beautiful gardens (although the whole hotel is beautifully maintained) so we…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,1,Problem with an animator .,"I had a big problem at the hotel, with the animators and especially an animator who called katy (karima) like when I was me and my wife at the swimming pool discussing her coming to disturb us, and we forces to comment on the site that the hotel is incredible but in reality it is the opposite, thank you for your understanding but I think you have to manage the problem with her quickly. thanks.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,5,An amazing stay at this fantastic hotel,"Arrived in the dark but was very happy with the welcome at reception and it was not long until we were unpacking. Food - we were impressed with the food on offer at all three meals. Always a great selection. Salads were incredible and very different every day. Hot food stations were good as was the pizza - choices of three - and chips, pasta etc. Plenty of lovely fresh bread. The selection of cakes were brilliant especially loved Moroccan night trying cakes I had never had before. Fresh fruit on offer - one night a chocolare fountain and strawberries. On our final night prawns, smoked salmon and oysters. White, red and Rose wine - help yourself aong with soft drinks and beer. Coffee only on offer at breakfast but a help yourself machine in the main bar and pool bar…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,4,Relaxing Easter Break,"We booked this hotel through BA before Morocco opened its borders again so got a great deal. Did not regret it, from the moment we arrived until we left we had 100% friendly service without exception. Although all inclusive the drinks were to a decent standard and the food at the buffet restaurant was fresh and well presented. We agree with some previous reviews that it can become a bit repetitive but that’s the nature of the beast unless you are paying premium prices. Breakfast, lunch and dinner on most days could provide something different and there was nothing presented that we thought no! We went to the Zen pool rather than the main as this seemed to be adults only and so quiet and peaceful, plus a handy bar! No issues with getting sun loungers. Normally we use hotel gyms…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,5,Great spring holiday in Marrakesh,"Thank you Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech for the great experience. Excellent resort. I could say that you have some of the best staff, very friendly, always happy and smiling, very helpful and always there to provide excellent service. When you need something Abdel is there with a great smile and a good joke to make your day :). You would like a drink, Adraoui already has it for you. Me personally, I haven't seen anyone complaining. even when we haven't had the best weather condition, they found something to compensate : cocktail party, cooking contest, the evening activities like ""guess the song"" competition"". Our 7 years daughter says that is the best holiday that she's ever had (big fan of sunny holidays and she's had some in Canaries, Caribbean, Sardinia, Greece,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,5,Wish we could stay forever,it was our first family holiday abroad since COVID. We and our children had an amazing time. it was so good that we decided to extend our stay from 7 to 10 days! the staff is always smiling and will do anything to make your stay better. everything is so clean. the staff work so hard but always with a smile or a friendly word. the food is amazing and abundant. the grounds are beautiful . you can book day trips around Marrakech from the hotel. there are free shuttle to get to Marrakech too. the entertainments during the day and evening is great. i cannot fault a thing and we cannot wait to be back!,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,4,Bits to improve but good,"Beautiful grounds, facilities and rooms need a bit of an update - tatty round edges and staff a bit of a mixed bag (some brilliant, others unhelpful and reluctant). Food good, with lots for vegetarians, and bus seemed to run well to town. Note that kids pool is cold at start of day, both others seemed warm. I HATED the banging music and activities round the family pool which seemed to go on all day without much of a break.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 April 2022,5,"Great hotel, even better staff","We’ve just finished a 5 day stay at Iberostar in Marrakech and have loved every minute. There is always so much to do, the rooms are clean and the food is great. The staff were all friendly and attentive and go over and above for all of the guests - particularly Simo and Piriss who bring a real energy to the entertainment and kept us smiling our entire stay. Would recommend to anyone and would come back!!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,5,Great choice for a family holiday,"We had a fantastic 7 day holiday at Iberostar Club, Palmeraie in April. The hotel is well set out and we found it very clean and tidy at all times. The hotel gardens are lovely and well worth exploring. Service was excellent , all the staff were friendly, polite and incredibly hard-working ! Our room was comfortable and was a good size with air-con and a good quality TV. We had a garden view room near the Zen Pool area so it was wonderfully peaceful too. There are plenty of activities to keep children and teenagers occupied but also some lovely quiet spots for reading and sunbathing . The pools are clean and safe with lifeguards on duty. Food and drink are of a good standard - plenty to choose from. We became very fond of the Moroccan Rose wine ! All in all , a great…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,5,Very enjoyable stay. Great value for money.,We have just returned from a week stay at Iberostar Marrakesh. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. Our daughter enjoyed the kids club and pool. Food was great too. The resort grounds were well kept and pleasant to walk around in. Overall great value for money and would highly recommend for families with young children.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2022,4,Super hotel out of town,"We had a super time at the Iberostar- to be fair, as we were leaving the number of guests was climbing so the lovely peace and quiet we enjoyed might not have remained! But it’s a super hotel in stunning grounds. The staff were simply incredible. There was not one person who didn’t exceed expectations. They literally went out of their way to help you. I hope they are paid well as they deserve it. French is definitely the main language - but while you are always greeted in French they do pivot to English as soon as they realise you’re an English speaker. That said, all the written notes, the quizzes on the PA etc are in French. We deliberately asked for the quietest room and wanted to sit at the quiet pool and didn’t want rowdy. We were recovering from a stressful season -…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,3,3rd Visit Disappointing 😢,"Disappointed with my 3rd stay here. Have been here in Nov/Jan times and had no issue with entertainment or the variety of food in the restaurant. This occasion found that there was limited choice in the restaurant with fruit being only in a small quantity of orange/grapefruit with an apple/banana sometimes. The desserts were the same everyday at lunch/dinner. Ice-cream only once at dinner. Quality of food still good and service in the restaurant excellent. Entertainment has never been this bad, you normally get a few nights where acts have been brought in but this was their in house team only and was very poor set up that we only stayed 5 mins on each night then went off to play cards in the bar. Nice pools but limited beds and most mornings by 9:30am all taken with towels but…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2022,4,Immaculate hotel.,"Very good all round hotel, upto usual Ibrostar standards. The grounds are immaculate and worth a good walk round, a lot bigger than you might think. Will look even better in the summer with all the flowers out. Service through out was excellent. Cleaners also doing a brilliant job keeping the place spotless. Usual good choice at meal times in the restaurant, with plenty to choose from. Food was served to us at first, but back to normal later in the week when it was busier. There was sometimes a lot of fish, and not a label on to say what it was, difficult if you have an allergy like my partner. Although we did mention it to the management later in the week so may improve. Pool was surprisingly warm, good size for a swim, and plenty of sunbeds around. The hotel customer…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2022,5,Perfection,"Overall I would rate this a very solid 4* resort. ROOMS Perfectly fine however the least inspiring aspect. Rooms are just good, certainly not super-luxurious however well maintained. Balconies are really small. I was fine with it. GROUNDS Wonderful, easily to a 5* standard. Very large and well layed out for what is a medium sized resort. Great care is taken to keep it looking great. POOLS The Zen pool is a stunner. Quite, relaxed and very appealing. The main pool is terrific also, larger and more suited to families. LANGUAGE I have seen comments suggesting that only French is properly represented. This is an unfair assessment, I feel. Fact is that French is a principle language in Morocco and there are also a great many French visitors. When staff realised I spoke…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2022,4,Great stay,"Nice hotel with very well kept grounds. The hotel is very clean but probably needs some refurbishment in areas. There’s always a variety at meal times. I wouldn’t recommend the burgers at the outdoor food stand. Plenty of activities. The staff were all pleasant and look after you well. The evening entertainment is fun, especially after a few drinks. Hotel is 30mins from airport which cost 300dirams, 230 on way back. It’s 100dirams deposit for each towel. Only complaint is our bedroom corridor was noisy with people talking and banging on doors. Would definitely return.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2022,5,Wonderful stay! We will come back!,"What we enjoyed the most was the staff, the activities and the food. Special shoutout for two members Abdel at the Food Truck and the manager lady of reception (sorry we did not type the name down). They went over expectations to ensure that we had a good experience. We are definitely coming back next year with family! Things to try Archery and Trapeze definitely! It is also great that there is the option to stay in the ""entertained"" pool, or you can move to the zen pool where you can relax.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2022,5,3 day stay in my Morocco Holiday,"I may be a little different to many reviews here the reason, well I have visited Morocco many times. Stayed in multiple all-inclusive, flats and riads in Marrakesh, the Atlas mountain and the coasts. So on we go, with the pandemic and a new daughter I hadn't visited since early 2019 and was desperate to get back. As I was bringing my partner (who hadn't left Europe before) and toddler I wanted the trip to start well and in comfort. We land and as always I pick up the hire car, my partner then has to experience Marrakesh and the driving before we arrive. We arrive at 2 pm fill in the paperwork with a drink then catch the end of lunch as the room is not ready. So let's start with the food, unlike the bigger all-inclusive in Marrakesh the choice is limited. Now saying this I am…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2022,1,"Violated by staff, offered drugs","Overall the worst hotel I have been to in my 43 years. I arrived at the hotel on my birthday excited for a break especially as I have vacationed at this chain in Mexico, Jamaica and DR. The reception staff that checked me in was friendly. I was to welcomed with a drink or anything, which was ok but a little disappointing. On my second day after having lunch at the pool (burger) I became ill and resorted to my room for the next few hours. I contacted reception for support as I was travelling alone.The staff was not helpful, they refused to get me some soup to my room feeling me they do not do room service.Staff came in my room and accused me of taking drugs. Two days later I was offered cocaine in the karaoke bar by the bar tender. No only do I feel disrespected, humiliated,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2022,4,Fine Hotel,"Overall a fine hotel with very friendly and good service. Nice rooms, clean and fine Food in restaurant is not the best but pasta/pizza is ok - other food was not very impressive. Also the first all inclusive restaurant I ever have seen, that does not have simple Icecream . There where only cakes. It is not allowed to pick up your own food, but you have to wait for employees at the buffet to put something on your plate. Quite slow process - why not just have some gloves that must be used, so guest on their own can pick up their foods. The employees typically only have the covid-19 mask limited on their mouth/nose - so overall waste of effort. Place some plastic gloves at the buffet and let the guest pick their food, much faster",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2022,4,"Excellent experience, but room for improvement","Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to any foreigner visiting Marrakech, and would stay here again. The food is amazing, the rooms are nice, the staff is constantly upkeeping/maintaining/cleaning the property, and there are many activities (archery, acrobatics, tennis, golf, etc.) However, there are 2 areas in which I was not fully satisfied. I stayed in a suite (which was lovely - it had 2 bathrooms, 2 balconies, and plenty of seating). The suites are all located directly above the lobby/foyer, so any noise there (such as wedding receptions or even just conversations) could be heard from our room. Not a huge deal since when we were sleeping it was quiet, but it was annoying during the day - so just a note if you're considering a suite. The staff overall is…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Our agent advised the new hotel were paid however upon arrival this was not the case. However the new hotel still provided 2 beautiful garden view ground floor rooms while things got sorted.

 November 2021,4,Great family resort,"Few practical tips. The kids club is from 4 yr olds up and runs from 10 to 1 and from 3 to 5. It's fantastic and the activities are well planned and varied. It is attached to a little playground and beside the kids pool which is very shallow. We have a 4 year old and I wasn't worried about him going under at all. The rooms are nice but basic and the beds are very hard. I would say they're a 3 star but the rest of the resort is like a 4 star. We had a ground floor garden terrace room. All the rooms are the same, no point in upgrading. Balconies looked tiny. There are no kettles in the rooms for doing baby bottles but there are microwaves for sterilizing in the dining room and the wait staff will wash bottles. The veggie food is good and varied.

This time we stayed in a suite, which is lovely, bright and spacious. It has one full bathroom and one separate toilet and sink - which is handy as men ... well, the least said about that the better... The most outstanding feature of this hotel is its staff. I have read other reviews saying that the French guests are given preferential treatment. That has certainly NOT been my experience at all. Yes, French is much more widely spoken than English but that is the history of the country and French guests are very much in the majority - especially currently when there are no flights from the UK. …",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

I would highly recommend staying in this resort.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2021,3,Avoid if you don't speak French,"Well, this hotel was rather disappointing. The main issue is the inability to speak English from most staff member. Of all staff only 2 people could communicate with us. The remainder staff, entertainment staff included, would ignore us because they did not know English. It was shocking actually experiencing people coming to us speaking in French, ask them to speak English, and actually turning around and go away. I was appalled. The only English speaking member of the entertainment staff was Mydi, who was really nice and good to us and would deserve a 5 star on his own. Aimad was the only staff member at the services, in the Zen pool bar, who could speak an amazing English and would actually talk to us. We had a suite, which was nice and acceptably clean.

Special compliment to the Chef. Food is really well cooked, and variety is great, my only negative comment about the food offering is the pastry in the morning is so so. Taking into account we r in Morocco (where bread and pastry r somewhat amazing on average) it is close to terrible. Waiters are very prompt and attentive, 5* for their service. The only reason why I didn’t put 5* for the hotel is because I was disappointed with lack of enforcement of mask wearing in the restaurant.

 December 2020,1,No customer care at all...stay away,"I booked this hotel for next December 13, one week stay, through Agoda. Received from hotel, an automatic message of welcome in my Agoda account, next replied the message to inquire about city shuttle details. Was never answered, therefore using the iberostar customer care plus the direct hotel’s email address, this time for a much more urgent matter. My flight back to Portugal was cancelled and alternative flights needed to show another Covid test , so I needed information where I could go in Marrakesh to do it, and hotel’s assistance for advance booking. Even told them without it I would cancel my stay. Iberostar customer care, first answered and told that forward the case to Iberostar Marrakesh to answer me. No reply at all.... I even insisted again with both to be answered…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 August 2020,5,Best staff ever met,"Pros : - The staff are very friendly, helpful (The receptionist need to be more smiling) - Too many activities (archery, foot, volley, pinpon, golf...) - Food too varied and gourmet (Tanjia, pastilla very delicious) - The night parties so wonderful - Covid 19 sanity check Cons: - Location so far from the airport & center (for those willing to visit the city) - Rooms a little tight (however the bathroom is too big) - The double bed is only two twin beds covered by a blanket - Quality of some food need more effort to be delicious (shawarma, tajines of meat) (crepes, waffle & jus on the school bar) Can be improved - The opening of water bottles ""ain soltan"" not practical (otherwise each visitor should get a bottle opener) - Put another place to get water bottles instead of the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2019,4,An all-inclusive get-away from the hustle and bustle,"We spent most of our 10-day holiday in the Medina or new Marrakesh, but I wanted a few days lazying about doing nothing and decided an all-inclusive club would serve me and my 8-year old well. It's a very nice hotel, with huge comfortable rooms, friendly and helpful staff. I was studying and needed some files printed out, and the receptionist was so obliging I felt really taken care of. The buffet breakfast and dinner were always plentiful with lots of options especially for kids. They also have a selection of local cuisine, which made the dinners more interesting. For lunch we always stayed by the pool and made the most of the food truck that served hot dogs and burgers. I know, but it was just too convenient!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,4,Hotel Resort outside of Marrakech,"the hotel is located about 30 minutes outside of Marrakech and offers a free shuttle service to the city centre multiple times a day. the rooms are spacious and clean. the hotel resort complex is huge with several pools, palm gardens, a pond and a kids section. animation and several sportive activities are being offered. the all inclusive option is highly recommended as the lunch and dinner buffet is quite amazing with delicious food, especially the local cuisine. the only issue was the weak wireless internet connection.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Large bathroom with towels and toiletries (soap, bodylotion, showergel, shampoo and conditioner). Laundry service if you wish. The buffet is amazing. Lots of different food and is constantly replenished. Unfortunately breakfast and lunch did not have many options for a Vegan. You can sit inside or outside. The waiter even remembered what I drank at dinner! Also the bar staff remembers what you drink and arranged soy milk for me. The hotel resort offers all kinds of sports/activities/entertainment. All for free.…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2020,1,Worst hotel experience ever - zero luxury or customer service. Solo females please avoid!,"After staying previously in a Spanish Iberostar which I loved I booked 3 days here solo for a supposedly relaxing break in a 4* hotel. The grounds are beautiful, it’s close to the airport by taxi and I enjoyed the house wine. The positives stopped there for me. - Harassed by several Male members of staff (leered and gawked at continuously plus the lifeguard literally shouting after me ‘your beautiful’ several times like some creep on the street). Insane behaviour at a 4* hotel, I’d never seen unprofessionalism like it. Felt like most staff had just walked in off the street and picked up working! - Most staff do not speak English very well (or at all) and make absolutely no effort to do so as very few guests are English compared to french. Especially bad were the bartenders to…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2020,5,Amazing,"Just returned having spent 4 nights here. The facilities here are suberb, rooms are nice and of generous in size. No complaints with the food reasonably varied and something to suit everyone's taste. The staff are exceptional how they treat the guests. The entertainment staff do a great job. Especially the two Mr Hamza's and Big thank you to Youssef in the outdoor dinning area, who's made our stay memorable. The pools, grounds and tidyness of the hotel in general are excellent. There's not too in the area, but the Hotel runs a free shuttle bus to and from Marrakech, this takes about 20 minutes approximately. Thank you Iberostar Hotel for creating wonderful memories for my wife and I. 👏",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2020,5,Amazing holiday for 30th Wedding Anniversary,"Just returned from an amazing week at the hotel. The whole experience was special. We had a completely relaxing holiday, amazing food, lovely room and the staff are what makes the hotel really special. The are a lovely team who clearly love what they do and spread their joy and enthusiasm on to the guests. We are quite quiet private people but never felt pressured to take part in any activities and our privacy was respected at all times. The staff always tried to communicate to us in English which was really appreciated. The food was outstanding and we never got bored and thoroughly enjoyed every meal. We were sorry leave, although we only just managed to get home before flights were cancelled. Hope all the staff and guests and ok at this testing time. We will be back.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,"Great hotel, amazing facilities and great staff","We stayed here for 5 nights in February. From check-in to leaving our stay was amazing. The hotel has beautiful grounds and amazing facilities. You can either go full one and partake in all activities or just lounge around the pools (they have three!) We were AI as I believe most of the guest were. Food was good, better if you are a meat eater but we were never disappointed being vegetarian. My only criticism would be food labelling, we had to on a number of occasion ask what the dish was. From Breakfast to dinner there is plenty of choice. The food truck was also very good, my husband said he had one of the best cheese baguettes from there, you will definitively leave a few pounds heavier. The staff are what make this hotel great, they are super friendly and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2020,5,Gluten free special needs,"Amazing! Such kind staff, falling over themselves in the restaurant to ensure at each meal I was shown food that was safe and non contaminated for me as a coeliac (gluten free) and offers at lunch and dinner to make me special pizza and pasta and nothing was too much trouble - was not made to feel like a nuisance, but a princess!!! The rest of the staff around the whole grounds are so friendly and cheerful and make you feel very welcome and, by jingo, they work long hours but are so full of cheer and kindness Thank you so much",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2020,5,Amazing staff and beautiful grounds,The food was absolutely delicious and we loved the suite we stayed in. The staff doing activities were really friendly and helpful as were all the hotel staff! The all inclusive was really good value and the shuttle bus service was great. A special thanks to the staff on the trapeze who were really nice and encouraging when I was really scared which enabled me to do it.

 March 2020,5,Honeymoon,"This hotel is amazing, we have spent 7 nights on our honeymoon and have found the hotel clean and spacious, staff super friendly, special mention to Hamza and Mehde they make the entertainment so worth watching and captivate the audience, thank you to Haji the restaurant manager for arranging my husbands birthday surprise it was totally amazing, the staff here go the extra mile with a smile on their faces.

 February 2020,4,Nice place to golf and relax,"Had a great week with my wife (and a golf-group) in this hotel. Rooms are ok, and staff is very friendly. All-inclusive (breakfast-lunch-dinner) is sufficient, and all day long you can have small snacks near the pool. Only grievance is the dinner-room, which is really noisy. So find a place to eat outside, if possible. Nice golfcourses nearby(30-40 minutes) like Amelkis Golf, Palmeirae golf, Palmgolf Ourika and Royal Golf Marrakech.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 February 2020,5,West London golf society tour,Wow the minute we came to the hotel it was 5 star treatment for the next 6 days. Staff very helpful rooms very clean. The restaurant and bar was excellent. This is my second year at this hotel am looking to come back every year one of the reasons is this hotel the catering for everything. They even have a bus going to town every 2 hours for all guests. 16 of us went we all can’t wait to come back next year !,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,3,Definitely not a 4 star hotel,"Our stay was comfortable, hotel room was very clean. Staff at reception and bar were extremely friendly and helpful. The all Inclusive food was of a decent standard and plentiful. The WiFi is very poor, we weren't able to use it at all on some days and evenings.. The rooms were exceptionally small with tiny balconies and no drawers for storing away cloths. The bathroom doors are not good and did not open or close smoothly. They did not replenish the water bottles or provide hand and face towels. the hotels is situated around 25-30 mins drive away from the town center which makes it difficult to just pop out as everything has to be planned. the overall experience at this hotel was decent at best. Lucky for us our group of 16 was awesome and we had exceptional time ALL DAY…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,All Day Long,"Cannot fault the hotel, staff, location and overall experience, as soon as you walk into the main reception you are welcomed with a high level of service. Staff very friendly and helpful, the grounds well maintained and promote a relaxing environment. Love the burger van. The weather was good but chilly in the morning and cold at night obviously because of the time of year. You could change money at the reception for a good rate if you wanted to but they had a cash machine which you could use if you don’t have money to exchange. I stayed for one week, rooms cleaned every day to a very high standard with special touches each day. The food was incredible. So many traditional dishes and each tasted lovely. The desserts were incredible. Often buffet desserts look better than they…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,Great!,"This hotel far exceeds one's expectations of a 4 star resort. As well as the great facilities, the standard of accommodation, cleanliness, food, activities and the entertainment provided, the hotel excels in it's level of service. The staff, who are efficient, caring and enthusiastic, cannot do enough to ensure a wonderful stay. I enjoyed the spa facilities, took advantage of the bus service, currency exchange (decent rate) and luggage storage. The food is varied, fresh and plentiful and includes several local dishes I'd not eaten before. There is a full timetable of sporting activities. If there had been time I would have tried the trapeze, but I'll do that when I return next year. I enjoyed a 5 star experience here. Need I say more?",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2020,3,Worth staying there but room for slight improvement...,"Friendly staff who are very attentive. Clean hotel. Good activities outside but could do with a bit more for the late afternoon crowd. We missed out on things like archery which would have been fun but they only had it at 10am when we were out. Shops were also closed too early so we never got a chance to pop in. Rooms were fairly basic as they lacked certain things a budget hotel would have such as face towels, bottled water (only one between 2) Iron was available on request which was good. Food was OK, except if you are an earlier riser breakfast was prepared an hour in advance of opening so was always cold for the first people there. The WiFi was terrible. No WiFi whatsoever in the rooms. Food at lunch and dinner was decent, would be good to get some insight in to what is…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,Outstanding Hotel - You WILL Be Back,"I had booked this hotel as a 70th birthday treat for my mum, and I could not have chosen better. We arrived several hours before check-in but the porter immediately took our luggage, we were offered a seat to complete the necessary forms, brought cold fruit juices and told someone would be with us shortly. Within 10 minutes a lovely gentleman introduced himself and took us on a tour of the grounds and facilities. This has NEVER been happened at any other hotel I have stayed in and is a lovely touch. As soon as this was completed, to our surprise, our room was ready. The room was spacious and the bathroom generously sized with a huge shower with a wonderful rainfall shower head. They had even went to the trouble of putting petals on my mum's bed wishing her a happy…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,4,Superb Hotel with Golf,"Stayed here for five nights during last week of February. The customer service at the front desk, restaurants, bar, amenities and room service were exceptional. The food at the all inclusive buffet during breakfast had variety, good choices, and always had clean tidy tables available. Only had lunch once there so cannot comment much but during dinner it was always great. There was themed area, such as kebab one day, sea food another and Spanish. There was always an area with Morrocan food which was my favourite. The hotel fell short in some areas, such as bidet, decent shampoo and shower gel, face towels, and of course water in the rooms. The bar areas were good but lacked that extra luxury. The hotel is also small comparatively with others in the area. All in all a great…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 February 2020,5,"Sunny, warm, great pools and with very friendly and helpful staff","We have just returned from a great all inclusive week. A new holiday experience for us so we were slghtly nervous, but pretty much everything exceeded our expectations. The site is very large and well maintained so it is easy to stroll away from the main pool and bar areas if you want a bit of quiet. We swam in the heated Zen pool with no problems - just swim when it opens and you avoid the children which some others have complained about. We also used the table tennis and boules with no problems. There is an extensive choice of food, the tagine could probably could have been more spiced for us but overall we had lovely meals. And the staff were all brilliant - friendly and helpful.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,3,Iberostar Palmarie Marrakech,"Having gone to Marrakesh a few times we decided we’d try a different hotel this year. 1. The “Zen” Pool - Advertised to be “adults only” on the website, however it is constantly filled with small children being loud and most of all interrupting other’s swimming. This seems to be very randomly policed, which only causes more arguments. 2. Wifi is pretty non-existent and temperamental at that 3. The Traditional Moroccan Restaurant - Offered couscous and pastilla on the website which we received none 4. Room’s are very echoey and housekeeping are often moving beds early in the morning which can be heard 5 doors down! 5. The reception activities are unnecessarily loud, especially for such an echoey place. We found it impossible to be near it and hear each other talking and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,Couples trip/first time in Morocco,"Just got back from holidaying at this hotel and would highly recommend. The staff are very friendly and super attentive especially with drinks - one waiter (unfortunately have forgotten his name!!) always made sure we had drinks and we never had to go to the bar and he always remembered what we drank. The food is great, apart from the 'bacon'at breakfast, although there is lots of choice and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. There is also a food truck outside which is convenient in case you want to lounge by the pool all day and not have to get dressed up to go inside and have lunch in the main restaurant.

 February 2020,4,Beautiful Hotel Great Staff,My husband and I and our 14 year old son visited for 5 nights in February. After surviving the transfer from the airport( there appears to be no road rules!) we were relieved to reach Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech. The hotel is beautiful with luxurious furnishings and decorations and perfectly manicured gardens. We were immediately seated in the reception area and we had a glass of juice while completing the check in paper work. We then visited the restaurant for lunch before it closed and then went back for our room key. The room was ideally sized with a large spacious bathroom. We had a pool view although we were directly over the outside restaurant seating area which wasn’t particularly attractive! We walked around the grounds which are extensive and noted that there…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,4,Great hotel just needs a few changes !,We stayed for 11 nights in October and had a great time overall. The mini water park was great for our 3 year old as was the swimming pool the female life guard was fantastic with the children and went out of her way to make them happy. Our son loves the zoo also. Food was good although did become repetitive after a few days as most all inclusive do. Drinks were ok. The food truck was infested with wasps though and although our little one loved the idea we were worried of the hygiene of it. Our main complaint was the mini disco. Our son love it but we felt it was way too late for little ones to start at 9pm. We did go but paid the price in tired tantrums after it!,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,Perfect hotel and fantastic staff,"I have just returned for a week in this superb hotel. For February we had fantanstic weather, between 18 - 28 most days, but chilly mornings. The staff are first class, especially the animation team and bar staff. I was so shocked when they remembered my name and what drinks I would like! We really enjoyed the lunches, evening meals and the snack van. Also while lazy by the pool the guys would come round with donuts and crepes, wow! We had a meal in the restaurant and that was made special as it was my friends birthday and they provided a birthday cake, without charge. My only one personal choice I made that I wish I didn't was to go to the spa. The guy who showed us the spa was full of cold that I then caught and still have. I paid 500dm for an hour and they actual treatment…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,Beautiful hotel with amazing customer service,"Just returned to Ireland after 4 nights with 12 girlfriends in garden view rooms. We found absolutely nothing to complain about. The hotel is spotlessly clean throughout, food great with huge choices, massive drinks selection and great services. The Spa is fantastic, grounds and gardens beautifully kept and the swimming pools are clean and extremely well maintained. What makes this hotel so special is the staff. We didn't have to ask bar staff for drinks, they brought them to us at the pool as and when they felt we needed them, the courtesy, kindness and professionalism from every staff member we encountered was second to none. Cannot wait to return.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,Super hotel,"Very beautiful hotel, much space around the hotel, the staff is exceptional friendly, and I mean really everyone. A big thanks to Abdel who made every dinner a pleasure. The food is very nice, warm, enough choices. Animation team is also super, they go to everyone, always friendly and don’t push you if you don’t want to join an activity. Hamza & Mehdi thanks for the good care! Rooms are spacy enough, very clean. There is a shuttle bus to the city and back. If you want a taxi, that’s possible to. Nothing is to much to ask here. I enjoyed every moment there!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2019,3,Lovely grounds but basic hotel,"Starting with the positive - the grounds are great, the pool areas really lovely, didn’t partake in the activities but they seemed pretty interesting. Restaurant not thrilling for an all-in, the special tagine dinner booking was not worth it. Rooms were pretty basic and not 4* but fairly clean, beds uncomfortable and pillows thin. Good for a cheap break but come with lower expectations.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2020,5,Perfectly wonderful all inclusive in La Palmeraie,"We stayed here for four days looking for some warmth away from a UK winter in February.

Restaurant is buffet style with SO MUCH choice! All food needs are catered for including gluten free, with the local dishes on offer being plentiful and amazing! Staff in the restaurants are friendly, attentive and once they have seen you a couple of times, like family! Iberostar should be very proud of the team in Club Palmeraie.

Me and my friend were lucky with the weather as it hit 28 degrees pretty much every day. I thought the zen pool was fantastic given that the bigger one hasn't warmed up due to the weather only becoming warm this week. The hotel staff were all very welcoming, fun and friendly. The food I couldn't fault, there was plenty of choice. For an all inclusive I did notice that the pool closed at six and some meals were only available at certain times. The van made it that you could have something always pretty much in the day but unfortunately after nine at night I don't know if there was anything available to eat. I might have just missed that to be fair. The bedroom was lovely and beautiful and clean but there was…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The food was good with an excellent choice. The staff were fantastic, they knew our names and couldn't do enough for us. whether in the resaurant, the bar, by the pool, can't praise them highly enough. We just wanted to laze by the heated pool most days soaking up the rays but we were encouraged to take part in several daytime activities.

 January 2020,4,Wonderful holiday resort,"Had a great January mid-winter break in the sun here. Almost everything you can ask for from an inclusive resort... Friendly staff, good food, well-stocked bar, clean spacious accommodation, spa, heated outdoor pool with plenty of sun loungers and a wide range of easy access sports facilities if you're feeling energetic! Our only criticism would be the cats that seem to have the run of the place. Not sure if they were wild but there were loads of them hanging around the outdoor dining area every day and on our 2nd day one jumped up on my lap while I was eating - that was the last time we sat outside for lunch! They were drinking water from one of the outdoor pools and even wandering into the inside toilets - just strange that this was allowed to happen!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,4,Pleasant Surprise!,"BACKGROUND: To start, I am an avid traveller and have stayed at many resorts in Mexico, Cuba and Dominican Republic. For this trip, the purpose was to experience Africa for the first time and enjoy the culture, while experiencing some time to relax at an all-inclusive. I stayed from Jan 26-Jan 31 and travelled with my cousins (2 adults and one 3 year old). We arrived at the resort and the front desk staff was very pleasant. The check-in was smooth and they spoke enough english for us to have all of our needs taken care of. We were 30 mins from airport! ROOM: Our room was close by to the pool (pool-view) and lobby. The rooms were not 'high-end' per say however they were very decent and tidy. The doors to the bathroom were very cool and the window in the room was also very…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2019,5,Sweet surprise,"After arriving at Marrakesh airport you are treated to a spotlessly clean airport and very quick (as long as you in fill your little white sheet of paper for everyone in your party with every detail it asks) but very secure entry to another part of the airport but before your allowed to leave you again have to put your bags on to another x-ray machine, but after that it’s straight outside to a lot of taxi drivers asking to take you to your hotel but if you pre-booked your transfer just go to where all the boards are and look for your name, give it over then enjoy your ride to your hotel. When you get to the hotel the security guards help you take your bags in to all I can say is a magnificent open reception area with a jaw dropping chandelier, the reception staff are more than…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,The Hotel Staff Made the Holiday!!,"My husband and I spent 6 nights at the Iberostar in Marrakech for a little break after Christmas. It was all inclusive and relaxing which was just what we were looking for. The reception staff were amazing and couldn’t do enough for us. We got a room upgrade to a suite and it was beautiful. Not one member of staff let them down, they were all so friendly. The bar staff took the time to know what everyone drank and were preparing our drinks as we walked up to the bar! The smiles were infectious. There was a free shuttle bus several times a day in to marrakech and back to the hotel. As with many all inclusive hotels the drinks are limited to house wines, local beers and spirits and cocktails. If you wanted imported drinks or Champagne then there was a surcharge. The food was…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Excellent overall hotel experience,"We really enjoyed our stay at Iberostar Palmeraie! Not sure what makes this place special but we enjoyed the whole experience, room was comfortable, food was good, staff were excellent, animation team really friendly, grounds were relaxing. The whole experience was a good one and much better than expected, we have stayed in plusher hotels with more stars, better ratings but this was an excellent overall experience and we would happily return to Club Palmeraie, the balance was perfect!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,4,Great relaxing week away,"Just back from a very relaxing and enjoyable week at the Iberostar. We read all previous reviews with anticipation so now our thoughts on this pleasant hotel. The Food is very repetitive but can’t fault it. Something for everyone and plentiful. Lovely breads, salads, tagines etc. The food is good and the wine is lovely both red, white and rose. The quality of alcohol is very good and water, coffees, teas are plentiful and easily accessible all day. The animation team are all very pleasant but do border on a bit annoying after a few days of saying ‘no thanks’ to their persistent attempts to get you to join in. I appreciate its their jobs and they do a good job of said jobs but not everyone wants to play crazy golf or aqua Zumba when instead they’d rather enjoy their book in the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,3,"Good, but not overwhelming...","We had wanted a quick getaway in January, not too far from UK, reasonable weather and good quality hotel. The Iberostar in Marrakech seemed to fit the bill and we have just concluded a six night stay. The hotel was chosen for a number of reasons: - All inclusive ( at extremely good value when comparing to the bed/breakfast option) - Adults only pool - Choice of restaurants I will come back to these shortly. The hotel is half an hour from central Marrakech and is serviced by a free shuttle bus which runs throughout the day. The grounds of the hotel are vast with three pools, an array of activity options including trapeze(!) and children’s club. The staff are most attentive, helpful and multi-lingual. Overall, our experience at Iberostar has been fair to good, but our reasons…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Brilliant,"I created this account just to leave this review - the whole place is brilliant, but in particular the food, and even more importantly, the staff.

I wouldn’t hesitate booking this trip again for that reason alone.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2019,5,Bri’’’aaannnn,"Amazing family holiday filled with everything we needed. Can not fault the hotel, staff, location and overall experience, as soon as you walk into the main reception you are welcomed with a high level of service. We stayed in the main block and had a garden view, rooms cleaned everyday to a very high standard with special touches each day. Food and drinks are lovely and we always found something to eat and drink. We made friends with a lot of staff/ waiters but are favourite was Mo ( Snoppy); he was so attentive with us and especially with our little boy and always brought extra treats and made a special effort. The jewel in the hotel’s crown is the entertainment team, especially James, Mounain, and Firmino (my little boy changed his name as he looked like the LFC footballer…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2019,5,New Year get away,"Stayed here for 6 nights with our 2 teenagers over the New Year period. The hotel is very well managed and the staff/service is 5 star. It is obvious the staff enjoy working here. Always happy, smiling and making sure you’re having a nice time. The NYE gala dinner was amazing. All food and drink in the resort was excellent. Lots of activities if you want to get involved. A visit into Marrakech is a must. It would’ve been nice if the tour company within the hotel had information in English. We did eventually manage to book a tour with them into the Atlas Mountains which I must add was an excellent day out in a 4x4. Overall we had an excellent experience staying at the Iberostar. A fabulous allinclusive 4star hotel with a 5star service. We would definitely recommend…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Fabulous,"This was my first visit to Marrakech, the Iberostar was absolutely stunning. Great rooms, delicious food, the grounds were beautiful. The weather was good but cold at night obviously because of the time of year. Beds were lovely & comfy with plenty to do during the day with all sorts of classes & activities going on. We booked a guide to take us around the city to all the focal points of interest! The staff were very helpful and happy to accommodate. I would definitely go back to the Iberostar Palmeraie as it was spotlessly clean. I really enjoying time there!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Wonderful resort,"Stayed here for a week in January. Lots of activities to do during the day: archery, trapeze, boules, table tennis, spinning... plus a small gym, which was suitable for a decent workout. The food was lovely. Yes it was a little repetitive, however there were so many things to choose from- you could eat something different most days. I’m also vegetarian and had a great selection All the staff were fantastic. Reception staff were always helpful and helped us with phone calls on a few occasions. I also used the spa. The hammam was amazing! I loved it and went twice. Meena and Amina were fantastic. The waiters and animation team were also superb A few negatives- a little more info about things going on in the bar would have been good. We missed bingo and games night as we didn’t…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2020,5,Five Day Stay,"Just returned from 5 days at this hotel and had a fantastic time. The hotel is excellent and service/staff five star. Check-in was quick and professional and our room was changed after a request that the original room smelt strongly of cigarette smoke. Rooms are clean and beds very comfortable. The food in the main self-service restaurant is excellent - lots of choice and lovely fresh food often cooked in front of you. Different choices each night - we especially loved the sushi, raw tuna and prawns. The salads were delicious too. We ate one night in the Moroccan restaurant which you can only do once during your stay. There was a bit of confusion about booking it as was originally told it was fully booked and open only three nights a week, but we managed to get a booking…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Initially we had a drink in the bar and then headed to our room. Our initial room was on the ground floor, however, after speaking to the reception staff we were moved to a 1st floor room. The staff at this hotel were all amazing. They were all friendly and attentive. Nothing was too much trouble. The food was varied. Live cooking on 2/3 stations each night. Chocolate fountain, breakfast, lunch and dinner! The pastries/cakes were supberb. I can not faults the food at all. The local Rose and beer was good. As were the local gin and barcardi!

We had a 12 and 6 year old and enough to do for them and the adults. The large pool was far too cold but kids were allowed in the heated 'adult' pool as long as they weren't too noisy. Kids were allowed to roam around freely as they complex is enclosed and safe. Food was great, especially the range of vegetables and vegetarian food (i'm not vegetarian!).

Arriving late, we were shown to the restaurant where we had a late bite to eat and drink, then shown to our room by a member of staff. The staff on this hotel are probably the most friendliest people I have met in all my travels, always smiling and polite, the Animation team are always happy but never pressure you to participate, Khalid was a great member of this team as they all are, I got to know all them all by the end of the week whilst I was there, although not really my thing, I did a few activities, wonderful to watch the kids (and some Adults) trying the Trapeze, again the staff look professional and really look after their participants.

Initially I thought they missed a suitcase and went back to the taxi because it was not on the trolley but they had quickly put this inside to hide that the handle was damaged by them. The whole check-in process took nearly 45 minutes, you have to fill in a form and they provide your wristbands to show that you are staying ‘all-inclusive’; staff were trying be efficient and dealing with different groups of people at the same but in reality seemed ‘lost’ and ‘confused’.

Weather was low 20s during the day and chilly at night (but you are in the desert). Hotel was lovely, spacious and good number of beds around the pools. Staff are so friendly, always stop to talk to you if you want and cannot do enough for you. Had the Berber Hammam which cost about £40 which I think is a great deal. Couple of little shops on site, but if you smoke watch out they don’t sell cigarettes. Could change money at the reception for a good rate and they had a cash machine. We got money at the airport and shouldn’t have bothered! Good range of food in the buffet, got a bit samey but not surprising over 9 days.

As on our previous visit we found the staff to be really friendly and helpful. Food was very good and always a good choice as well. Breakfast was really lovely. It was nice that you could either sit inside or out to eat - mainly at lunchtime as it could get quite chilly in the evening. The food truck provided lovely food if you didn't wish to venture to the restaurant for lunch - burgers, baguettes, and then later in the afternoon waffles, crepes and delicious doughnuts (didn't worry about calories as we were on holiday).

 December 2019,4,Lovely hotel. Shame about the location,"We chose this hotel because it was recommended as part of a BA package. And it is a fabulous hotel although the staff are a bit offhand and they make you wear a wrist bracelet to indicate your meal entitlement status. But it's a long way out of town and they're is nothing nearby. If you don't use the free shuttle, it will cost 150-200DH (£12-£15) each for a taxi depending on your negotiating skills. Also be aware that the property is huge and if you are in building 2 it will take a good 5 minutes to walk to the main complex. The breakfast though is fabulous. If we were to come again we without pay more and stay in town.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Bit far out but transport provided to and from the square. Entertainment was pretty decent at night. Staff overall were amazing from front desk to cleaners to food staff to management and also entertainment staff.

Tried as we might, we failed to spot a Moroccan cloud, all week! The facilities were very good indeed - petang, volleyball, football, gym, outdoor spinning and the trapeze, to name but a few. Sports' staff 'encourage' you to take part, but are not offended if you decline. It is however, recommended that you do, as you need to burn off some calories acquired from the amazing food on offer!

I have never been to a hotel where every member of staff I interacted with was genuine and friendly. I travel monthly and have visited 58 countries and honestly this is an incredible hotel.

The bad bits were small and easily fixable: - Wi-Fi is bad. Buy a SIM data card beforehand - the hot water is warm - there are too many paper cups used, but single use plastic use is minimal However, the entertainment staff are engaging and their enthusiasm made the holiday the best this year.

Try not to stay in the main building, there are other buildings on the hotel compound that are quieter. Check in was very average, staff not really with it. Had to fill out a form to check in but wasn’t told why. I also had to email my reservation to them while they waited because I didn’t bring a print out (who brings print outs anymore?!)

So much choice! Everything looked delicious and tasted as good as it looked. I didn’t hear one complaint all week.

 November 2019,5,Fantastic,"Just returned from a 5 day stay here and all I can say is that I loved it! Please focus on the positive reviews of this hotel over the negatives. Arrival: we arrived at about 2100 and were greeted and checked in by the lovely reception staff. Our luggage was taken from us and we were shown where to get some dinner before it shut. There was no delays in checking in, however there were only 3 people arriving at this time. Understandably, I imagine it can get a bit hectic if a huge bus full of people arrive at the same time! Hotel: the hotel is impeccable. Very clean and well looked after. The grounds are beautiful and it’s well worth having a lovely walk round in the morning to get your bearings and see what the hotel has to offer. Room: our room was perfect, very…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,4,Wife’s 50th Birthday Surprise,"Stayed here from 24 -27 Nov as a surprise for my wife’s Birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly staff and given an arrivals brief. Our room was clean and tidy and a good size. The heated pool is very popular at this time year because it’s heated and the larger pool was so cold. The heated pool is the “quiet” area so our party were asked to move for being to load. The fact that we were only chatting and laughing did annoy me at first but tbh the larger had a better atmosphere around as they have music playing and its were the entertainment team perform and do the organised activities, which suited us better. There is plenty to do during the day, French Bowls, Table Tennis, Badminton and volleyball. The entertainment team also put on other events, darts,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,Amazing break at the Iberostar,"Been meaning to write this review for a while. We stayed here in October. Myself and daughter and two sons. Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely young man who made sure check in was straight forward, we were offered a room to change as our rooms were not ready. Rooms were beautiful clean and spacious, our lovely cleaning lady made sure of that. The hotel itself was always lovely and clean, the staff there work so hard to make sure everything is perfect. I fell ill when then and saw a nurse within 10 mins of asking. The food is amazing, they cater for everyone, themed nights every day and a good selection of gluten free food which made my daughter very happy. When asked about what she could and couldn’t eat the Chef come out and explained everything to her and said he could…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,4,Great place to chill and enjoy Marrakech,"I took a week’s break to relax and enjoy my wife’s birthday in Marrakech. The Iberostar hotel was clean with well maintained grounds. Check in was quick with their multilingual staff. French and English were the two main languages spoken. Please bring your own face flannel and cream as none was provided. We thoroughly enjoyed Moroccan cuisine and will be trying our hands using the Tagine cooking pot bought in the souk. There was a variety of dishes for every palate and we were pleased that Iberostar provided authentic Moroccan dishes. Although it was all inclusive, with beers, adequate wine etc, do not expect premium/brand liquor. For the price it was good value for money. Entertainment was average but the white night party was very good. Main pool was freezing at this time of…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Fantastic stay in Marrakesh,"Had an amazing stay here. Food was really good. Plentiful, always fresh and well cooked. Room large and kept very clean. Super shower. Grounds are wonderful. Very well kept and loads to do. Tennis, football, mini golf and even a trapeze 😊 The entertainment staff are fantastic. Work tirelessly and so friendly. The evening show was mainly dancing but what dancing. Special mention to William. WOW! Should really been on a big stage somewhere. Thanks to all for a wonderful holiday. If ever I return to Morocco would definitely come here.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Made by the staff...,"From check in to departure the staff are king! I’ve been to some of the best 5 star resorts but you can’t buy friendliness and genuineness in staff! Me and my wife needed a short week away, originally booked a 5 star all inclusive in Turkey but Thomas Cook went bust so this was very last minute..but so happy we chose here. Positives: Zen Pool, adults only - kids quickly ejected Yay! And at the Zen Pool you’ll meet “Salah” who has to be one of Thee best bar:pool staff I’ve seen in twenty years of travel, an absolute star!!

 November 2019,4,Nice place...,"Went for a week as it was my partners birthday. We had a lovely time at the hotel. Food was different but I did enjoy it, my partner enjoyed it more than me. However, I loved the pool snack bar (bus). Entertainment was ok, some nights better than others. Nightclub was ok, smelt a bit like the toilets. I think if this issue was fixed more people would’ve gone. Not much to do in the day. Pool life was a bit boring. Main pool is FREEZING, took a bit to get used to but it was no problem. Staff were lovely, especially Abdul, Jamal and the guy who runs the entertainment. Thank you all for a nice stay ❤️",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Safe haven,"Had a three night stay and loved it as a safe intro to Morocco. Loved the food with much choice and lots of seating areas for different moods. Good pools and bars, pleasant staff. Free bus into and out of town. One big plus point only became apparent after spending time in Marrakech, that is clean air. The air quality in Marrakech was poor due to all the mopeds and ancient taxis.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Fantastic staff with plenty to do.,"Just returned after 4 night stay Sat to Wed. The best thing by far are the super friendly staff. Nothing is ever to much and they are always willing to serve with a smile and a chat. Loads going on all day if you want to join in or just chill by one of the pools. The main pool was quite chilly but always plenty of beds and no need to get up super early or reserve a bed. Always plenty of food although a bit repetitive. The food was hot for the majority of the time and being refilled regularly. Things like eggs, omelettes, fish, chicken and pancakes cooked at hot plate which you might have to wait two or three minutes if there's a small queue. There are basic local drinks with the all inclusive and the option to pay for premium brands. Cocktails are made to order along with…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,3,WiFi poor in rooms,"Spoke to reception a couple of times that the WiFi only works in our room when by the room door but the situation never changed. It could so easily be fixed as seems the access point which serves the main courtyard area and also the rooms has a problem. I stood on the balcony underneath it and got no internet, even though the signal was full bars. Went back inside the balcony to reception area upstairs and it worked fine again. Fix this and you would have more happy guests as loads of people complaining!!!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 November 2019,2,A hotel of opposites,"First of all the good. The hotel staff are superb (not sure about the receptionist joking that there was no booking - not that funny), friendly helpful etc. The grounds are stunning and the rooms clean. The bad. I don't recognise others comments about the food. We found it bland, tasteless, and we were very disappointed I also suffered from a bad stomach which made the journey home more stressful than it needed to be. We had booked a double room, which was two singles pushed together. Not that conducive to a couples romantic weekend retreat. The wifi is virtually useless for any ]real time connection'. As an example I could not check into our flight. If you were up early facebook might work We would not return, despite the good points.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,4,A weeks holiday,"We have just come back from a weeks holiday at the hotel, the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to assist u with anything you needed or wanted. The food and drink were excellent. The only problem we had was that the main swimming pools water was too cold to swim in(while the kids and Zen pools water was fantastic), now this could b because we went 31st Oct to 7th Nov but it did rather spoil the holiday",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2019,5,Extraordinary Service,"It may be normal to name a few members of staff that performed above and beyond, but every staff member was friendly, helpful and courteous to an extraordinary level. Full credit to the management for their recruitment and training program! Food and facilities worthy of the 4 star label. We were a group of 22 golfers, so sometimes we may have been a bit loud and boisterous but this was dealt with perfectly; well done and thank you!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Food wise a wide range of food each night for each course in the buffet restaurant.

 October 2019,5,Great Hotel For Families,"THe room is very nice but wouldn’t say 5* quality. They don’t provide hair conditioner or body lotion. Had a lovely view of the garden. Bathroom good, big shower, water pressure excellent. Initially for approximately 4 days, we had to put up with really rubbish tv. Only had English speaking news channels available. Then we had a problem with the phone and when the engineer came to fix it, we asked about the movie channels. He promptly re-tuned it and we got the movies, yay!!! We paid for all inclusive and unfortunately the food was so great, I put on 2.5kg, despite going to the gym every day but one.

On my birthday the hotel gave us champagne and cake by the pool and sang happy birthday and made me feel very special for the entire duration of the stay. Food was yummy and there was a good variety everyday - especially as two members of our party were vegetarian. The complex is always clean and tidy, beautifully designed and decorated. As we went during off-peak season / just before half term it was a bit busy but not completely packed, the choice of pools meant you can enjoy peace and quiet or a bit more atmosphere with the music, DJ and entertainment. I'd like to thank all the staff that welcomed…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Overall the hotel is very clean, the food is excellent and the staff very friendly and polite. Nothing was too much trouble. This made the holiday easy and fun. There was sufficient food and snacks throughout the day and we did not feel hungry. There was also a shop on site for snacks and essentials if needed. WiFi a little hit and miss but there.

 October 2019,5,Fabulous hotel,"Our stay got off to a disappointing start when we were told the interconnecting rooms we had booked were unavailable. However, the managers couldn’t do enough to make it up to us and we were given free minibars in our rooms, champagne, chocolates and a driver for a day to take us around Marrakech. It’s so refreshing to find somewhere that prides itself on customer service in this way. The hotel is immaculately clean, the staff friendly and very hardworking and the facilities extensive. And the food is incredible - fresh, varied and beautifully cooked. We will definitely return.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2019,5,Half term break,"We stayed here for 10 nights in October and had a fantastic time. The staff were so helpful and friendly and liked chatting to guests - especially the entertainment staff who were fantastic with the children (Mehdi, Hamza & Ayyoub especially...). We had 2 interconnecting rooms which were of a reasonable size, very clean and nicely decorated. There is also a fridge in the room. The food is predominantly buffet style with a fantastic choice and some variations from the staples each night (sushi, seafood, kebab, chocolate fountains etc) and all very tasty, but can be a little samey if you go both lunchtime and evening. We tended to make use of the food truck for lunch (burgers/hot dogs) for a change. Mid afternoon goûter of doughnuts and crèpes also delicious. The Morrocan meal…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We soon had our keys and the bags were kindly taken to our room for the week. The room was clean, modern with a nice view, in the 'quieter' part of the complex. The food at meal times was some of the best I'd had on all inclusive, a good variety of food for a week's stay.

Well maintained grounds, gardeners always working hard. Pools & surrounding areas clean & tidy. The bar at the Zen pool ‘adults only’ was handy. The waiter would bring us our drinks once we had been up a few times. Great food choices, always fresh & plentiful. Alcoholic drinks are strong. Friendly, hard working hospitality staff. Handy location for camels, quad bikes & buggies. Under 30 minutes to the airport. Free shuttle to town or £8/100 dirham taxi ride.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The quality of the food was great with a wide variety each day so you never felt like it was repetitive. The facilities are great with two large pools- a quiet one and one where there are activities going on. There was also a children's pool. Pool areas spotlessly clean with plenty of sunbeds. There was nightly entertainment and the staff made sure that everyone felt included and without exception they each went out of their way . the highlight was the ""white party"" (everyone dressed in white).

 October 2019,5,Great place.,"Went for 5 nights and had a corner room overlooking the Zen pool and gardens with mountains on the horizon. Very quiet and peaceful. Room spacious, with fridge, air con, toiletries, fresh towels daily and a small balcony. Zen pool is for adults who want a quiet time, Salah, who runs the pool bar is fabulous, always collecting glasses, bringing drinks, tidying up pool area and very chatty too with guests, nothing is any trouble for him. The main pool has entertainment for both adults and kids and busier so not the peaceful area. There is a kids pool too with water slides, and all pools has more than one lifeguard on duty. Restaurant buffet is huge so no problem getting a table, and an eating area outside too. We had a waiter called Walid who looked after us every day, and when…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2019,4,This hotel did not disappoint!,"We were a family party of six, aged from 25-60. We thought this hotel was good value for money. It was clean and the staff were extremely cheerful and helpful. The pool areas were fab and we enjoyed spending time at The Zen Pool which was adult only. Salah who ran the pool bar was particularly friendly and looked after us all. We were a little worried that the buffet would be repetitive but that wasn’t the case and each lunch & dinner was different and provided a great range of dishes. The bars also provided a wide range of drinks with an option to buy branded alcohol if preferred. We thought the local gin, beer, wine & cocktails were all fine. The rooms were spacious & clean.

 October 2019,4,"Lovely hotel, lovely food, amazing value for money",I stayed here for 4 nights with 5 girlfriends and I honestly cannot fault the place. It was clean and welcoming with a choice of 3 pools. The food was lovely (seafood paella at lunch was to die for) and the staff were courteous and welcoming. We had an interconnecting room (3 per room) which was perfect for us as a group of 6 girls and this would be great for families with older children too. There were great kids facilities and always seemed to be something going on to entertain them. The communal areas were spotlessly clean and well maintained. The rose wine deserves a special mention (I'm very fussy about my rose!) but it was perfectly pale and delicious! We got an amazing deal and found the hotel to be excellent value for money. I would definitely recommend this place :),Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We stayed here from the Tuesday 15th till Saturday 19th October just myself and husband. It was faultless from start to finish we really didn’t want leave. The reception is beautifully decorated as is the whole resort. The rooms are fantastic with your own private balcony. The main oasis restaurant has plenty of choices and a particular area changes each night with a different theme. The main bar is a must after dinner with a great pianist who sings many songs fantastically! Abdul and Ahmet need a very special mention they are fantastic and a little politeness goes along way, please do ask them how they and shake their hands, just because it’s all inclusive doesn’t mean they don’t deserve…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 October 2019,5,Hospitality as it should be!!!,"We, a family of four, two boys one small one not so small have just returned from out stay in Marrakech, we booked a well earned rest and a guaranteed week in the sun at our October half term. I would like to quell any worries regarding fact that some people have said the hotel isn't the 5* that you would expect in the UK. This is perfectly true, but that was perfectly fine with all of us. The hospitality shown by every member of staff was exceptional, from the cleaners and gardeners to the management all working extremely hard to ensure every guest has a faultless visit.

Guest rooms are spacious, quite well equipped, extremely clean and everything works. There are different categories and they are in a variety of locations throughout the grounds. Our Pool View room was very convenient for the hub of the hotel. The lobby is impressive (old Morrocan style) and leads through to a wide selection of lounges close to the main bar. We liked the outdoor area for a pre/post meal drink. The main dining room is light and airy and there is also an extensive outside dining area.

 October 2019,2,Basic ..NO luxury.. resort,"We stayed here after a 4 day stay at a 5 * raid in the medina. Despite being well travelled we have only stayed at an all inclusive twice before, once being Dubai and the thervtime the Maldives ..both were 5* ultra luxury. I know this resort was 4* but expected a certain level of luxury and I could not have been more wrong. On arrival, this resort looked like a budget hotel and when I was shown our room I was so disappointed as it was beyond basic. Cheap furniture, no bathroom just a small shower room, no mirror above the vanity table, no robes, nothing luxury at all. We were here for 4 days so decided to make the most of it...the zen pool was okay, the pool was basic and out dated. The sun loungers were not cushioned and there was no waiter service around the pool. There was…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2019,4,Fabulous,"Myself daughter and grandson aged13 came 2cdays ago. Met with the warmest welcome. Being near the city it is not as luxurious as beach resorts but still fab. Large grounds with rooms spread about so can be a walk to facilities if that is a problem. Large family pool is very cold but weather very hot. Food and drink is good in the buffet and not booked the other as yet. Alcohol has limited selection but fine for our group. Rooms are clean and comfortable although beds a bit firm. Staff are very approachable and friendly, nothing too much trouble. We had a fabulous meal and bottle of wine in cafe arabe in the old medina for about £10 each. We got a guide for 100 dirham who took us and met us to bring us back to shuttle bus. Well worth it as we would have got lost. We plan to go…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

After a friendly check in, greeted with a cold drink, local pastries and chocolates we were shown to our room which was lovely. We were invited first night to a cocktail party hosted by the manager before dinner in the gardens and it was lovely. The complex has 3 pools. One for children, one which has music and entertainment and a final one which is a quiet pool for adults only. All are serviced by bars with a great range of drinks and cocktails and between all 3 is a snacks van open all day serving hot dogs, burgers ( amazing burgers with real meat ) waffles, crapes, sandwiches and drinks.

 September 2019,5,Another Wonderful Holiday!,"We have recently returned from a second, blissfully relaxing 10 day break at this beautiful hotel. Whilst 'officially' classified as 4*, the Club Palmeraie offers nothing less than 5* service in all areas. Nothing is ever too much trouble - requests are always fulfilled promptly with genuine warmth and a desire to please plus staff members, regardless of how busy, frequently take the trouble to exchange a few words or joke, creating a lovely atmosphere with the personal touch. So impressed are we with the exceptional staff, food and facilities of this hotel that, less than a week after our return, we are already planning to return for an unprecedented third consecutive visit next year.

From check-in to check-out the staff were always friendly and on hand to help whenever required. We had a lovely room with a garden view which was very close to the Zen pool. Due to this we had no problems with noise at any stage. The greatest asset of this hotel is no doubt the staff members and the animations team were exceptional throughout. They lead all the activities throughout the day - stretching/yoga, spinning, ballroom dancing and belly dancing, aqua gym, water polo, table tennis, badminton, volleyball, football, archery and trapeze! These are on offer every day and you are always encouraged to take…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2019,4,Relaxing break,"I travelled for a short break with my elderly mother. Weather was in the 40's , but didnt feel too hot due to the dry heat. We had a double garden view near reception which was very clean and airy. The bathroom had a large walkin shower. The only amenities were shampoo , body gel and hand soap. Our room was just across from the indoor bar , restaurant and a short walk to the main pool. The main restaurant had a good variety for lunch and dinner , but breakfast was very limited and we got bored by the second day. There is the usual egg station , limited fresh fruit ,and very fatty bacon.The items did not change the 4 days were were there.

 October 2019,4,What a fun hotel,"Wonderful, fun staff who go the extra mile to make you smile! The rooms are spacious, the hotel grounds immaculate, and the pools clean and welcoming! Loved both the Zen pool and the activity pool. The white party (on Friday night) was really fun. Definitely use the free shuttle bus into the medina, what an experience...but perhaps think twice before taking kids in. Lots of hustle and bustle, the poverty is obvious and the traffic crazy!!! A few things would need to change before I could give the hotel 5 stars... 1. Very little of the food at the buffet was labelled. I’m the kind of person that wants to know what they are eating and hesitant to tuck into the unknown!

 October 2019,4,Good stay,"Staff super friendly and very helpful. Spoke multiple languages. All staff within the hotel were pleasant and accommodating. We felt very welcomed. Reception staff were able to easily accommodate our requests and able to help with a couple of things when needed. The security staff were fantastic, as two female travellers they ensured we were safe when leaving the complex. The room was good, clean, tidied daily as would be expected. Good size TV in the room - but we didn’t use it. Nice balcony area, overlooking the garden which felt private, secure and quiet. The bathroom was an amazing size. No bath, but that suited us fine as we were not travelling with small children. Entertainment team were great, again supper friendly, spoke multiple languages. We spoke to a couple on…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2019,5,Excellent week,"Arrive at the hotel and as you approach the entrance your bags are taken from you and you are taken to reception to complete the form for your stay. We were early so our room wasn't quite ready so went for lunch, upon our return the room was ready and we were shown to our room. As its a closed currency you can get Dirham at the airport or hotel, we got some at the airport just in case and as it happens the ATM inside the hotel was out of service for a few days (commission at the airport is expensive, so worth checking out). If you want towels there is a deposit of 100 Dirham per towels, pay at reception and get a token which is exchangeable in the building near the Zen pool. Our room was on the quiet side which was perfect for us, extremely clean and tidy. (a little advice,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2019,4,A nice hotel with great staff,"We stayed here for a week all-inclusive with a very good deal from BA holidays. It’s a little way out of the city which may or may not be a good thing for you. There’s nothing immediately outside the hotel grounds to see or do or walk to, but that is the same as all hotels in the Palmeraie area. The hotel runs a regular bus into the city - you are dropped around a 15 minute walk from Jemma el Fna square (not sure why they don’t take you closer to it) Within the grounds there is enough to keep you busy, or not! Pools are good with plenty of beds and some larger sofa areas, separate pool for kids. Kids clubs and activities for teens also. Outdoor exercise classes during the day. All the staff are super enthusiastic, friendly, and get to know you quickly. Never too much of a queue…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2019,4,Short break,We travelled to the Iberostar with British Airways Holidays on a 3 night break. We arrived on a Sunday morning and were quickly through passport control and baggage reclaim. We took advantage of the banks in the baggage hall to change up money. We located our transfer agent outside the terminal. We were assigned a taxi driver and in doing so was also given a list of excisions that the company - Sahara Excursions offer. We were advised to contact via phone or what’s app to book. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. We booked an evening excursion and they never turned up. The agent lied instead of just admitting fault. There is an excursion agent at the hotel and would suggest using them. The transfer takes you right through the middle of Marrakesh so you will experience the huddle and…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

I would suggest booking transfers in advance to and from the airport Hoppa or something similar . It was a bit chaotic at the airport at arrivals, you will need to get some money there too as you can’t take it in with you,there are exchange booths and cash machines or you can wait until you get to the hotel as they changed money too Couldn’t really fault hotel. rooms lovely , food was always fresh and a variety was great .

 September 2019,4,STAR QUALITY,"For 10 nights we stayed in this lovely hotel. We only have one moan and will get it out the way first! For 4 nights of our holiday the owners of the property, Voyages, decided it would be fine to utilise the hotel for a rather large conference. This would have been sorted for maybe more than a year in advance, surely the best thing would have been to book the whole hotel instead of imposing themselves on guests holidays or at least pre warn people looking to book that this was going to happen! They took over the pools in particular the zen pool which was supposed to be be quiet and made it more of a 18 to 20 holiday pool! They took over the eating areas at meal times, over staying there welcome making paying guests sit to one side and wait for seating, surely none of this is…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 June 2019,5,Fantastic Holiday,"Amazing hotel, amazing people. What a fantastic time we had on our girly holiday, my mum, 2 daughters, granddaughter and niece. My sister and 2 friends joined us 2 days later. We were made very welcome the hotel was spotless, food good and plenty of it. We could not find fault with anything, we asked for a room on the ground floor before arrival which we got interconnecting one, later check out (no fee). Surprised my mum and daughter with birthday cake for their birthdays, truly a nice friendly place to spend our girly holiday. The Botanic Gardens & YSL definitely worth a visit amazing.

The hotel has one pool without music und children over 200 meters away from the family pool. Very smart idea. All inclusive package leads at the end mix calculation for drinks. Only few one are good. Food is also okay, but like many Arabic countries, beef is not the core competence. Nights where quiet, staff is very friendly. Taxi to Marrakesch Central is 150 Dirham daytime and 200 after 8.00 pm. Approx 20 Minutes driving time. Was during our time fully booked.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Don't get me wrong, the service is super, the cleanliness excellent and food pretty damm good, so where can things improve ? Firstly, the wi fi anywhere outside the building is pretty useless if I saw the wording in the title once, I saw it a thousand times ! In this day and age, it needs to be as good as the inside. The parasols are in a fixed position which if there was room to move the sunbeds into the shade, it would be ok but you cannot always do this when people want to walk by. There is a lot of smoking outside, not everyone smokes, so why not have a seperate area. Not a fault of the hotel but there are times when kids…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 September 2019,4,Great relaxing break,"Stayed here for ten nights with two friends, we were after a relaxing holiday with the chance of experiencing the hustle and bustle of Marrakech as and when we wanted. This is exactly what we got, the hotel and all the facilities was just what we were after with the great addition of a free coach into town when we wanted. If the timings of the coach don’t suit there are taxis outside ready and waiting. As all the previous reviews have stated the food was of a good standard and the staff were all amazing, don’t really have anything to add on that front that hasn’t already been said. I had one disappointment which was the main dining room/restaurant, this room has no atmosphere and is not geared towards spending an enjoyable relaxing meal with family or friends.

We were the only people checking in so this was swift and we were off to our room in a matter of minutes....the porter taking our bags. We decided to head straight for the ‘White Party’ as we knew we wouldn’t really get to see it, but it was just finishing, however it did look like everyone had a thoroughly good evening. Our room was spacious, it had its own hairdryer, a free safe, air-con and a large TV. The air-con in our room 1160 was very good, the room as always chilled - however it was quite noisy so we did try a couple of nights with it turned off.

Entertainment team were great giving a special mention to Khalid. Evening entertainment was enjoyable. Hotel runs a regular a free shuttle bus to Marrakesh.

 September 2019,4,Relaxing break,We stayed here with friends that had visited the previous year. We had a lovely relaxing holiday and spent most of the time around the adult pool.

We stayed in room 2050 near the adult pool our room very nice but a bit tired in places (ie strached doors and handles that were lose) also the grass at the back by our terrace needed cutting I did request this at reception but it was eventually done on our last day.

But upon requesting the manager; Mohammed Ali we were accommodated. There was a wide and tasty selection on the menu. The restaurant staff were always helpful and friendly and explained everything as my brother has severe food allergies.

 August 2019,5,"Excellent hotel, food and staff","firstly, we had an excellent holiday and if i made suggestions to improve it i would be being picky. i would however comment on the disabled access and facilities (i took both my disabled elderly parents with me). it is fair to say an effort has been made to make it disabled friendly but it is not really adequate. the ramps are far too steep and in some cases unusable for wheelchairs. we booked a disabled bedroom but it wasn't forthcoming. my Dad slipped and fell sustaining a cut to his head and elbow because the tiles in the shower were so slippery when wet (we had to put towels on the floor to stop him slipping).

 September 2019,5,Amazing staff,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my wife for our honeymoon. The staff were so nice and welcoming and helped acomdate all of our needs. The hotel itself is big and has lots of facilities and they have different food on each meal so you dont get bored of the same breakfast/lunhc/dinner. The reason I loved this hotel so much was because whenever I asked the staff of any help they were always on hand ready to help. The only slight criticism of this hotel I can give is, it is far from the souks and you need a 20 min cab drive from the hotel, they do offer bus shuttle service but this doesnt run on the hour.

Location Hotel is 30 minutes by taxi from airport. Cost us £25 by pre booked taxi. As others have said, hotel itself is in middle of nowhere. Don't go there thinking its in Marrakech, as its not. Marrakech is a 20 minute drive. We walked to a supermarket near Riu and it was exactly 1 hour each way.

 August 2019,5,Fantastic hotel for a lazy family holiday,We stayed in this hotel with our two boys (12 and 10) for a week as part of a two week holiday in Morocco. The hotel is a little outside Marrakech (about 15 minutes in a cab) but that wasn't an issue for us as we had already spent some time in the centre of Marrakech. Most of the big all inclusive style hotels are in this area - there isn't space for them in the Medina. The rooms were perfect. We had two rooms (one for the boys and one for us) with a connecting door in between that could be locked from both sides. This gave us a nice balance of being able to sit up when the boys went to bed but also being able to keep an eye on them. The rooms were relatively simple but very nice and comfortable. The daily housekeeping was excellent. The food at the buffet is the best we have…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Room is quite dated furniture handles not fixed properly and shower didn’t work. We went to reception and were shown a few other rooms the first one smelt of damp (ground floor) the next one was up a floor but the view was of a roof with rubbish all over it.

 August 2019,5,Wonderful,"So let's start from the arrival. The airport in Marrakech is clean and surprisingly modern. There are landing cards to be completed on arrival and would be a good idea to complete prior to going to passport control to avoid queues. Just a note in the Airport you also need to complete leaving cards when departing too, which would be a good idea to avoid the chaos we walked into when you're leaving. Okay to the Hotel i will start with a slight negative as everything after this is absolute positive. We arrived at 2am by private transfer and i think we took the hotel by surprise. There was no welcome at all. We checked into our room, which had no safe, no water in the fridge (Which we could really have done with) and the patio door was not lockable.

Our room was a twin room which was nicely decorated and modern and we had a lovely small balcony with a slight view of the main pool. The room was spotlessly clean.

 July 2019,3,"Not bad, not great either","We had high hopes of the hotel, after reading other reviews, but felt the hotel didn't reach these expectations. Positives: - The White party. A lot of effort goes into the white party and is by far the best night of the week. - The food is okay. We always found something to eat and there were lots of choice for desserts. (Negative for food is that there is often flies in the restaurant and we have all had a bad stomach since leaving the hotel!) - The pools are large, the zen pool is very quiet and relaxing and there are lifeguards on duty. - Aqua aerobics was a lot of fun Negatives - The evening entertainment (other than the white party) is very repetitive. The entertainment staff pester to join in and dance etc, won't take no for an answer, even dragging us up by our…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2019,4,Can't wait to return!!,"Spent 4 nights here with my partner, from the second we arrived in the hotel we were greeted by the porter who took our bags and got us a glass of fruit juice while we filled in paperwork. The rooms are spacious and so so clean with a lovely fresh scent, we had a room overlooking the gardens which were so peaceful. Everything about the hotel is 5star (apart from the wifi), the food was just absolutely amazing, every night their was something new to try, beer and alcoholic drinks are good also and there's a choice of wines to have with lunch and dinner. The hotel grounds are beautifully maintained and there's so much to do to keep you occupied. We preferred the zen pool as it was peaceful and always plenty of sun loungers.

 August 2019,4,Great hotel,"Just returned from one week in this great hotel. As others have said there are so many positives about this hotel. The staff are a real credit to the hotel, so friendly and could not do enough for you. The ladies in the kids club work so hard and run a fab kids disco. The food is fab and there are so many activities to do. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. For a real get away and a looked after experience I really recommend this hotel. A few negatives (hence not 5 stars), which are probably personal preference: 1. Lack of ice creams/lolly’s during the day for kids. I don’t mind paying extra for these but the shop is not open very often. 2. The entertainment could be a little more varied. It’s 90% one dance troop. They are very good and it’s professional but the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Our two adjoining rooms were not quite ready and we took an opportunity to walk around the complex to get our bearings. We were stopped by the very friendly hotel manager to welcome us to the hotel and he advised us that he would check with reception to see if we could access our rooms any quicker. Several minutes earlier we were approached by a member of staff to advise us that we could go to our rooms.Excellent service!

They fetch sun beds, umbrellas for you, tidy up constantly and always with a smile! We didn’t really think the food was amazing as others have said. It was ok.

From when we arrived the staff were welcoming, helpful and flexible to all our requirements. The standard of rooms was as good as it gets, in the UK i would equate to Crown Plaza. The facilities in the hotel, the swimming pool, sports facilities and leisure were of a very high standard. The classes, Aqua Aerobics, spinning and stretching were enjoyed by us all. The kids pool, the mixed pool and adults only pool with bars/foods on sight meant everyone could enjoy fun swims, as well as more workout based.

Sara was always around asking if everything was ok, the animation team had so much energy and the evening entertainment was great fun. Choices of food is excellent. We took the bus into town a few times, be warned you’ll be hounded as soon as you step of the bus, but a polite ‘no thank you’ does the trick.

We had three rooms booked and as we booked months ago and asked for rooms next to each other, this wasn’t to be the case, our rooms were along the corridor from each other; also one of the rooms wasn’t ready on time, had to wait until 5.30pm to get into it; however by the end of our stay these gripes were a distant memory.

The hotel offers a lot of activities (pool, sports, animation) which made it very attractive for my family vacations. Also we enjoyed the food, which is very good and there is a lot of variety. Even the pickiest eaters will find something tasty. The rooms are nice and tidy. Although few things I found that can be improved. The WiFi signal was weak, I dont know if it was due to overload due to the guest numbers or the routers were far away. I would invest some money there in order to have a better experience.

Spacious safe to keep your valuables. Room tip: if you can’t find anything to watch on TV, retune it and a lot more channels appear. Food: Good selection of food at all mealtimes. Remember to check on the BBQ area outside otherwise you might miss out on some fab food. There are a few queues for the popular items but overall we were happy with the food we had.

I guess that's okay but it was a little bizarre watching kids and families with this song in the background. The food was, at best, mediocre. Also, the room was very noisy until about 11:00 pm.

There was always a huge choice and each day it was something different, the waiters and chefs were always so helpful and ensured that everything was topped up at all times! The service was incredible and they remember each guest by name and remember the usual drinks you order. Tables were always cleared fast too which was also a nice change compared to other hotels! Each waiter went above and beyond and made you feel at home, particularly the older waiter with sleeve garters who worked at Oasis Restaurant and the 2 working in the evening at Arganier Bar and always brought our 2 mojitos!

Iberostar was perfect for us and our friends who have a 2 year old as the facilities for our little ones were great. This is the first time I've stayed at an all inclusive so I have little to compare it to in that respect, but from the moment we arrived and received our welcome drinks all of our needs were met.

The pool which was for adults, away from the families. With its own bar, every day staff would come round with food, ice cream one day, these amazing doughnuts another day. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms clean. Facilities was catered for must families and couples. Entertainment for the kids and adults. Nightclub which is downstairs just beyond the bar inside the hotel, heads up tho it isnt advertised. Food was good, but with all inclusive holidays can get repetitive. For lunch they usually have the BBQ on. Free coach ride to the centre of Marrakesh, but book at reception. Would definitely recommend for both couples and families.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2019,2,Disappointing,"Although the grounds are beautiful and the hotel is very clean, our room was incredibly noisy. Not sure why you need to start blasting music at 8:00 am. The music continued until 11:00 pm, and then the talking and yelling outside our door continued way into the night. The breakfast buffet, although extensive, had many dishes that were inedible. The eggs were cold, as were several other dishes that should have been hot. We ended up wasting a lot of food. We felt smothered by the staff from the minute we entered the premises. We really just wanted a comfortable place to stay- not a frat party. This hotel could have been anywhere in the world. There was no local flavor.

The food was cooked fresh at all meal times with a wide variety of Moroccan, fish, meat and vegetarian dishes, fresh fruit and a great selection of desserts. The animation team were fabulous and a great variety of things to do for the children as well as adults, yoga, salsa, aqua gym, darts,spinning, water polo, or you could lie on your sunbed which there are loads. A special shout out to Hamza from the animation team who made us ladies laugh a lot. Also a special mention to Mohammed one of the bar staff that looked after us. We visited the Souks one evening which i would recommend, it was an amazing…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2019,3,Amazing week which ended very badly.,"My husband and I have just returned from a week at this hotel, we couldn't fault a single thing all week, the hotel was spotless, the food was delicious, fresh & plenty of choice. The staff couldn't do enough for you, there were activities on all the time (and the option to relax if its not your thing). So all in all a fab week.... until we returned to our room on the last evening to get ready & pack our case, I realised the outfit I had got out to wear wasn't there & upon further inspection a clutch bag wasn't either. We called reception and 2 managers came to our room instantly, they took details, photos & asked lots of questions, seeming to be really concerned and wanting to help. they then called the cleaning manager to our room who was arrogant and rude, he asked if he…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2019,2,Poorly set up,When we got there we had to wait about two hours to just get to our room when we got there we got ants.

They have a serious bee problem.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2019,5,Can't fault the staff,"A group of 7 of us stayed here in July 2019. Firstly, when we arrived we received the warmest of welcomes accompanied by drinks The hotel grounds look lovely and the rooms were clean and spacious. Walls not thin so you didn't hear all the noise from neighboring rooms. Lots of facilities such as 2 main pools plus a little kids pool, lovely spa, fitness room (which could have been cleaner and better maintained) All the staff were super friendly even the ones that could not speak English It may help to acquaint yourself with a little french should you deal with the cleaners or locals in Morocco Food was good I would advise not to drink tap water but have bottled instead (all the bars serve bottles) Free shuttle service into town is a bonus Haggle as much as you can. We thought…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2019,5,"Excellent hotel for families, friends or groups","Just back after five amazing days at this wonderful hotel. Nothing was too much for the staff and all were welcoming and friendly. Hotel facilities were spot on, something for everyone. Food was excellent with extensive choice for adults and kids every day. For those who don’t like Moroccan food when in Morocco and are usually in the ‘moaners camp’, you can have burgers, pizza, pasta and chips every day. Adults and kids are entertained by a very good animation team with all ages able to join in games and aqua sports or just sit, watch and laugh. We went as a group of adults but I would love to return next year with my two children. One thing to note is that there was a late night disco off site that we could hear twice out of six nights but mainly the hotel is quiet at…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We were a large mixed group of family and friends of all ages and without exception we all had a fabulous time. The hotel is lovely with comfortable rooms, beautiful well tended gardens and loads of facilities to use...or not.. Food at the hotel is varied and beautifully presented though it veered towards the sweet tooth especially at breakfast but I was always happy with the choice and flavour, make sure to try some of the dishes at the Moroccan corner...I particularly liked the potatoes with turmeric and coriander.

 June 2019,5,Fantastic hotel,Sat in reception waiting to return home after a thoroughly enjoyable time. The staff (mostly) couldn’t do enough for you and were very friendly. Animation team work hard although our kids are a bit older now. Food is very good for an all inclusive hotel and varied enough. Always a good pizza to fall back on if you need to !! Rashida and Adrouai in the restaurant are very nice and couldn’t do enough for you. Sallah in the Zen pool bar was also very good. Can get busy in the main bar but they work hard to get you served quick. Staff always cleaning and most of the time everywhere is spotless. Interconnecting rooms are perfect for a bit of privacy within the family. Watch out for a few ants on ground floor rooms - we always take ant powder and it sorted them no problem. …,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,Lovely Hotel with amazing staff,"Stayed here for a week recently and had an amazing holiday. There was very little to fault about the hotel. Nearly all the staff were very friendly and helpful all the way up to management but with special thanks to Mohamed in the bar, James and Hamza. The grounds around the pool were amazing and looked after by a team of dedicated people. The food was great plenty of choice at every meal, staff were very attentive keeping everything topped up. The animation and entertainment teams gave 110% every day. The hotel had lots of things going on cocktail party, master chef class, cocktail making, food demonstrations I could go on but I would just be repeating what most people say about this hotel Amazing.

 June 2019,5,"A wonderful, relaxing holiday in this patch of paradise!! Wish there was a rating above 5*, as this is at least 10*!","We have just come back from a wonderful week of being pampered in this wonderful hotel and had to write a review to say how lovely it really is. The hospitality started the minute we arrived, at 11.30 at night, after our flight was delayed. Our cases were whisked away and we we ushered into the dining room, where a buffet awaited us. The kind staff had known we were late and had kept the restaurant open, even though it should have closed an hour previously. After a bite to eat and a very welcome drink, we were shown to a spotlessly clean room and settled for the night. The next day we began to explore this wonderland and realised what a huge site the hotel covers.

You will always find something you like. We enjoyed the dessert after each meal. The staff is lovely and explain what they offer. During pick hours, you may queue for few minutes to get some special food. What I did to avoid that: just come 5 min later and the queue will be gone. Food do not end! Activities: they offer many activities for family. There is kids club with activities but require 4 years olds. Too bad, since our kids is only 3, so couldn’t enjoy that. Rooms: they are quite Ok. The all hotel is twin bed. But they could arrange it for couple if you ask. The rooms were refreshed recently, so no complaints at all. Outside: you can walk around and enjoy the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

I've never written a review before but knew I had to write one to share how lovely this hotel is. The rooms are beautiful and clean, also I'd like to give a special shoutout to the cleaner Zineb who was so sweet every morning and cleaned our rooms very well. The food was great, although repetitive with some variations day to day (such as a chicken shawarma or crepe station) it was great quality and the options were so broad you wouldn't get bored. Also, there was a BBQ every lunch time which was delicious. The pools were great and we never had an issue with not finding sunbeds at anytime.

I have stayed in Iberostar hotels in Mexico and European countries and this was by far the best. The choice is food was excellent, evening entertainment was extremely good.

 June 2019,4,Lovely clean all inclusive resort - amazing,"The resort was clean, employees were very friendly and rooms were very clean. Food can be repetitive after the first 2 days. The entertainment programs were good but very late in the night that we could only enjoy half way most days. Only complaint we had was the drinks at the bar were very diluted and not very good. Spa was overpriced and can be ignored. Gym was too small and almost no equipment. We used the daily shuttle 2 days to the Medina that for some reason does not go all the way to the Medina and stops a good long distance from it that you are left to take a taxi to get to the Medina - this is a good service by the hotel but can be a complete service if it goes all the way to Medina.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2019,4,Great value for money,"This hotel was great value for money, the rooms were perfectly clean and comfortable! We spent every day at the adults only pool which is a shame the lifeguard doesn’t allow fun at that pool but the main pool always has lots going on. The staff were all great especially the entertainment, Rony and Khalil in particular made a real effort to get everyone involved which was a special part of the holiday! The food was great with a fair amount of options for vegetarians which is rare! It was an ideal place to relax, ideally more frequent busses to Marrakesh city centre would have been ideal, but it’s only about a £10 taxi so it’s not too bad. Would definitely stay again. WiFi can be a bit sketchy but it’s enough to use WhatsApp, not a massive problem. Very nice, simple yet effective…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2019,5,Stunning,"I visited this hotel with my partner recently and we were blown away, we really can't recommend it enough. There is a choice of pools and we were particularly impressed with the Zen pool as it is adults only and we found the main pool quite loud. The food is very good and there is a great choice (my criticism would be that the food could have done with being warmer but I understand that this isn't an easy task). I would also be reluctant to call the a la carte restaurant 'a la carte' as there is no choice apart from whether you would like beef or fish tagine - the rest of the courses are served with no choice at all. We were however, very impressed that most of the cocktails are included within the all inclusive drinks. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2019,5,Superb all inclusive experience,Came here for a few days of R&R and could not have asked for much more. Great food and good drink options in a nice hotel.

 June 2019,5,Amazing hotel. Great value for money,"Firstly, I stayed with my wife and 2 year old son just to put into perspective. For a small family like ours (including a little fussy one) the team here made our visit to Marrakech very memorable. There was a time where my wife and I were discussing; had we not booked this hotel or similar... we would really have been stuck. The central part of the city where ""all the action is"" can be harsh for parents and kids due to the constant heat, haggling and trying to communicate with locals. Despite the apparent challenges we actually ventured for few hours almost every day via the free shuttle. Which kept our trip adventurous. The shuttle always on time and safe (6 round trips a day) The attention to detail and service is excellent. I have visited hotels all over the world and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Checking in-the porter took our luggage to one side whilst we helped ourselves to ice cold drinks in the reception, although it would of been nice to have been greeted with these drinks. It was straight forward we completed the paperwork and was taken to our room. Room - we were comfortable, well kept and cleaned each day, with TV and fridge.

The evening entertainment by the team was also enjoyable as I was called up on stage to join in the dancing to celebrate my special day. The rooms were clean & chambermaids were polite. We had a lovely rapport with all the staff from the manager to the bar & kitchen staff who went beyond the call of duty to make sure we were all happy & comfortable.

Welcome drinks in reception are a nice touch. The room was nice, we asked for a pool view but had to lean right over the balcony for a glimpse of the pool. Not a big deal but could have been disappointing. Also the rooms on this side can be noisy as it's opposite the stage, evening entertainment goes on until around 11:30 so request a room the other side of the hotel if you prefer quiet. The rooms were cleaned to a good standard every day, we called down to reception a couple of times for extra pillows and sheets and these were delivered no problem.

Disappointing after closing for three months refurbishments nothing that I saw improved the experience for the guests. They have removed the coffee making facilities from the rooms & have cut cost further on the food the provided. Cheese was gone last trip now the roast carvery / or fish they used to offer is gone. They have put a number of sofas into the dinning room ... it does help to reduce the canteen feel & noise but the are uncomfortable as there is no back support.

After about a 30min transfer to the hotel from the very modern looking airport Ménara (fyi even though we had paid for transfers as part of our package - the driver “cheekily” asked for a “tip for the driver”.

We have 2 interconnecting rooms which provided so much space and the bonus of 2 bathrooms. We were on the ground floor at the back so no balcony, just a chair, table and hanging space so if a balcony is important to you then ask for an upper floor or a front facing room. It was very hot when we were there (40°) and the staff all work so hard, even with it being Ramadan. The entertainment team were excellent providing daytime activities and the trapeze sessions most days. The evening entertainment was in a really nice outside space and we watched it most nights.

The food was great and lots to choose from everyday I have a fuzzy eater and he managed to eat pizza and meatballs. The deserts were so yummy kids loved choosing different things. At lunch time there was a bbq outside and always something different being cooked. We stayed at the baby pool everyday and just went over to the other pool due to having a 3 year old he loved the pool with water slide.

 May 2019,5,AMAZING!,"My brother, my sister and I stayed here for the half term week in May and we had the best time ever! From the moment we walked into the compound of the hotel, the service was up there! They had welcome drinks you could help yourself too and also staff who brought them over to you as well. The hotel was well kept as well, very clean! The all inclusive side of it is amazing because the food is amazing and will leave you wanting seconds. They had a food truck for snacks and drinks during the day also. There is sooo much to do around the hotel, especially if you have children there are kids clubs. They have a tennis court, table tennis, balls, trapeze, volleyball etc. Enough to keep you entertained throughout your time there. The staff there who are day time entertainers are…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,Just perfect and great value,"Travelled as a group of eight for a birthday celebration, rooms were all ready upon arrival except 1 which was fab as we were early and meant we could get all our stuff in the rooms and head to the pool. It was clean and tidy and there were plenty of sun beds and umbrellas, we didn’t use the zen or children’s pool but both did what they offered. The food was faultless with plenty of choice at every meal. Only negative there were a lot of mosquitoes which we were not prepared for but guess must be time of year as not experienced when travelled to Morocco before. If got any dare in you try the trapeze the guys were great. All staff extremely helpful and courteous,will definitely revisit",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,"Brilliant Hotel, fabulous holiday","We have just spent a fantastic week at this hotel. We would not hesitate to go back and probably will do very soon. There is very little to be critical of really. The hotel itself is large, but spotlessly clean throughout with large beautifully maintained gardens.Reception is impressive and offers a quiet place or two away from the sun if it gets too hot throughout the day. Our room was a great size for two adults and a teenage child with a very large double bed and additional single. Ample wardrobe/cupboard space, free safe, and Moroccan style bathroom. It was spotless. My only complaint about the room was that we were on the ground floor, our 'balcony' was nothing more than a small square with a table and chairs on. We used it to dry clothes but if you like a balcony to…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The staff are the best ever I have experienced, in Marrakech the entertainment staff are just fabulous, the shows, the pool games , never felt so relaxed, thank you to James, Khalid Hamiz And Robbie Hope I spelt their names right, my granddaughter Delilah had a great time with them all she is 6, I strongly recommend this place, I can’t say enough about it, food as well was great, bartenders as well, I could go on all nite, thank you hotel for having fantastic staff 5*****",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2019,4,Family trip with our baby boy - All inclusive,"As you’ll see I generally don’t bother putting reviews on but this was worth getting my iPad out for. Beautiful hotel very clean, ace staff, great food with mountains of choice so you never need to eat the same food twice. Staff were excellent except for one grumpy porter (because I was unable to tip him for taking the bags to our room). Pools are ace with plenty of sun loungers and a poolside bar/cafe. Seperate kiddie’s pool with loads of play stuff. Adult only pool tuck out of the way if you wanted total piece. Shuttle bus that runs in to town frequently is a good service too, and free. So what’s not so good about this place, honestly I’m struggling but if pushed I’d say the grumpy porter and the on site Moroccan restaurant could be better but as the buffet restaurant is so…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,Highly recommended,"We have just returned from a week here. The weather was fantastic and the hotel grounds are very well maintained. The staff are all friendly and helpful and all work very hard to cater for your every need. Although mainly French speaking, we had no problem speaking in English with them.The animation team work 24/7 and try to get everyone involved in something. Several welcome cocktail parties were laid on which was a nice surprise. There is unlimited food and drink available from many sources throughout the day and evening. The rooms were cleaned daily and Ramadan did not have any effect on how things ran at the hotel. We would definitely return. Thank you everyone for making our stay an enjoyable one.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Meeting rooms are attractive and have excellent sound and projection systems. A tech person was on site to help with any glitches. Additionally, the property is impressive with activities for all ages -the zen pool is a wonderful place to swim laps or just chill. The lawns and gardens are carefully maintained making for a beautiful atmosphere to relax and discuss conference topics. The food service for the conference has been awesome. On demand cappuccino and fabulous pastries make really special coffee breaks served my very friendly and attentive staff.

 May 2019,5,Very good value!,"Visited this hotel for the 4. time. You can see and feel that small improvements are being made all the time. Very clean hotel and rooms, even the paint will be refreshed when its a bit dirty. Food is of a very good quality. Personally we do not like the big restaurant, too big, too white so we are happy to have breakfast, lunch and diner on the beautiful terrace near the garden. The staff is great, at the bars, on the terrace and at the foodtruck. Only the WIFI needs some improvement. In the lobby its ok but in the rooms often no WIFI at all, especially at busy moments. The late check out policy is not nice, you have to ask for it several times, have to pay for it and than still have to move your stuff to another room. Can't there be a possibility to book this in advance, you…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2019,3,"Ok, but just ok..","Coming towards the end of a 5 night stay at the Iberostar. We have stayed at quite a few Iberostar hotels in Spain and have always been really pleased with the cleanliness and quality of food and entertainment on offer. The hotel in Marrakech is of a reasonable standard, but some things do disappoint, particularly the food which becomes highly repetitive when staying more than a couple of nights. There were no themed food nights and little in the way of 'cooked to order' food stations as per the Spanish hotels. Lovely big pool which is very cold and not climatised but as it was boiling hot during our stay this didn't matter. Biggest disappointment was the spa. Booked a massage as a treat and it wasn't worth the cost. There was no pre or post spa service, which would be expected…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2019,5,Great Experience at this hotel,"We were a group of 12 golfers staying at this hotel. We could not fault it in anyway from the moment we arrived till the time we left. All the staff were so helpful and nothing was a problem in accommodating our requests right from the check-in staff, the Chefs, the waiting staff, the animation and the house keeping team. The variety of food at breakfast, lunch and dinner was wide and catered for all tastes.Overall the experience was very good and would have no hesitation in returning there again . Highly recommend. Wi-fi coverage could be better.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The friendly hotel staff, excellent food (choice & taste), impressive swimming pools, relatively close proximity to UK & superb weather made it a great vacaction.

 December 2018,4,Two Splendid Weeks,"I recently had the pleasure of spending two weeks (Dec 8-24) at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie. As one who is used to the resort offerings in the Caribbean and Latin America, it was quite a shift to experience this particular Iberostar location, as well as Marrakech itself. The Iberostar Club Palmeraie (it is apparently known by a handful of names) is located approximately thirty minutes from the Marrakech Menara airport. There are some unpleasant stories one reads about passport control there, but I must have been an outlier: our wait was not long at all. But this is beyond the scope of this review. I made my own reservations for a car to take my party to the resort, and I am happy that I did so, as this helped us to escape the taxi gauntlet that otherwise greets those who leave…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

I was a bit apprehensive about bringing her to Marrakesh but I needn’t have worried at all. I couldn’t have wished for a better holiday destination or hotel. From arrival until departure we were treated with such kindness and utmost respect. People went out of their way to smile, compliment and talk to Paula and she felt like royalty throughout our stay. All the hotel staff at the Iberostar were nothing less than fabulous. Everyone and I mean everyone were so friendly and welcoming. Paula got so much attention and was spoilt by the staff with lots of love and affection.

There’s all sorts of activities and games being run by the entertainment team to keep you smiling Khalil, Ronny, Hamzar and James really made the holiday for us.

Youness on reception couldn’t have been more accommodating arranging an early breakfast for our departure and when we forgot our UK adapter he came to our rescue. All I would say is bring mosquito repellant!!! They don’t sell it in the shop here and there are lots of mosquitos day and night. The food is amazing, loads of variety. Fresh and clean dining area. Pools are lovely temperature, and cleaned daily. Our bedroom.......well what can I say!!! It was spotless. Will be making a return here for sure.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2019,3,Lovely hotel and brilliant staff however we had some hiccups,"We enjoyed our stay at the Iberostar, the restaurant staff and animation team were excellent at tending to the guests and their needs. However, we feel we should flag a few hiccups. At 3am one weekday morning, the private villa next door starting blasting music out. We spoke to reception who said the security guard had been over there to tell them to turn it down but no one was answering the door. This continued until 5am to which we didn't to get any sleep in that time. Understand this was out of their control, however it was equally frustrating. There are only 1 or 2 irons for the whole hotel, which seemed crazy for a hotel of that size. Which meant we weren't able to get hold of one before a dinner reservation in Marrakech town as other rooms were using them. On a few…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Check in: As soon as we walked in our suitcases were taken for us and we were told to take a seat, relax and drinks were brought over for us while the staff checked us in. We were a bit early for check in so we were shown round the hotel and went and had lunch in the restaurant area.

When we turned up, they took our bags, sat us down and offered us a cold drink whilst we waited which was delightful. The BellBoy (I cant remember his name) was so helpful and started talking to my friend in English about Tottenham football club haha and was so friendly. We turned up a few hours before check in, so we were given a tour of the hotel (which is stunning - the grass is so green, there are trees and flowers everywhere and so many different little areas to sit and relax in like a bar, a lounge area, a terrace etc) and then they allowed us into the restaurant to get some food before we…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2019,5,Fabulous food truck,"We had a room on the second floor away from the entertainment which had beautiful views. The room was cleaned daily and towels replaced frequently. My one gripe with the room is the cleaning times,on my husbands birthday the cleaner was knocking at the door at 8.50am whilst our son was still asleep, this only happened one day as the rest of the stay the same lady was in attendance and our roon wasnt cleaned until gone 3pm. I appreciate there are schedules but given the morning noise in the corridors there were families awake earlier than us. At times, in entering the restaurant it was busy with nowhere to sit but staff efficiently cleared tables to ensure you were seated quickly.

The food from breakfast, lunch to dinner was faultless - good range and delicious. Lots to do on the grounds so many activities and both big pools, one heated one not.

The entertainment team were great and names to mention are Rony (charismatic and did a great Aqua gym) who along with James always took the time to speak and have a bit of crack. Other members are Hamza and Raj who again showed a real interest in the guests to make sure they were having a great time. Bar man Zacaria (probably spelt incorrectly) was excellent - always making sure we had a drink and having them already poured before we arrived at the food truck and when another guest kicked over a drink arrived with replacement without being asked - such good customer service and a lovely attitude.

Very friendly, chats with the children. If you are coming as a brit, be aware that it is mostly French speaking and most stuff is in French. Not a problem as all staff do speak English if you can't do French. Things that I would suggest can be a bit off: There is Wifi throughout the hotel it is hopeless.

Although it was all inclusive we tipped the staff a couple of £ each time in local currency which they seemed to appreciate. Facilities were good and bed was comfortable. Only downsides for us were that the Moroccan restaurant was hyped up to be an experience but the food was dreadful if my opinion. The beef tagines were totally tasteless... the tagines in the buffet were far better. The unbranded alcohol wasn’t too nice - I tried the gin and whiskey but stuck to red wine after that.

The hotel is in the middle of nowhere, so you can’t walk out from the gates really, but they pull out all the stops to ensure you have everything you need in the grounds, (there are plenty of great trips to take and a hotel shuttle bus to Marrakesh centre if you want to get out and about).

Upon arrival we were taken to the hotel by a very efficient taxi company and it was lovely to see the streets of Morocco which are so very different than what we are used to seeing in the UK!

Overall we had a lovely holiday, plenty of activities should you wish to partake, the staff go beyond to ensure you are well looked after, you can see the interaction with the guests throughout the resort. Big shout out to the guys on the trapeze team, great with the kids and adults plus the young chap, Salah, at the Zen Pool Bar who single handed looked after the bar from 10 - 6, once he got to know your favourite drink he would bring it round on a tray for you without asking... sure he has a sixth sense!

 April 2019,5,Good family destination.,We were a large family group of 17 and without exception everyone really enjoyed themselves. Those with very young children did not leave the resort other than transfers and had plenty to occupy themselves with. Very happy with food/drink and particularly the positive staff. Others played golf on external courses or took tours . The Atlas Mountain trip was very worthwhile. I do think the Wi fi situation should be addressed ( if possible ) which I hope the management take as objective feedback. I still give it a top rating as everything else was very good.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 March 2019,2,WIFI WAS DREADFUL!,Stayed here for 7 nights with my teenage brother and dad. Overall I would rate the hotel 5/10 and here’s why... In my opinion it didn’t feel like a four star hotel. The staff at reception are welcoming upon approach and drinks available as you arrive. You have to pay city fees which you are not pre-warned about before you check in to your room. LOCATION: Hotel is located in the middle of no where and you are forced to take a dusty hot coach on a 15 minute drive every time you want to get to the town. There are no shops or restaurants that are walking distance. This made us feel restricted as we constantly had to rely on the coach facilities and couldn’t just go out when we wanted.

The pool areas also clean and plenty of sun beds, no need to be up early to fight over them! The staff were great! Very friendly! The food was lovely, veg is served cooked but cold which was not to my liking, plenty to choose from and a variety of choice.

We met some lovely people on holiday and the animation team really went out of their way to ensure guests engaged with each other (if they wanted to) and all had a great time. There is a huge animation team and they are all lovely people. Also there is a dance troupe who put on shows every night which is nice to watch.

The staff are so welcoming and warm, they make lots of effort to great a lovely atmosphere and were very warm and friendly to the children. This was especially apparent when there was a rainy day and the staff seemed to go to lots of effort to make it a fun day all the same. There is a very large buffet for lunch and dinner, the food was lovely - Moroccan, Italian, bbq, paella amongst other things. It’s fairly similar each day but that works fine as there’s so much to choose from. The splash pool is awesome for little ones to play in, and there’s tons of loungers around it so you can try to combine chilling and playing / supervising :).

It was very clean, and the staff were very helpful and pleasant, hence the 4 stars. The food was much as expected for an all inclusive buffet, with more local dishes than average. The weather was not great during our stay, which left a limited number of options within the hotel, although the staff did their best to provide some entertainment. The wi-fi is okay in the communal areas, but was very poor in our room. The main problem was the noise in the room. Noise came from the stairs, corridors, upstairs and next door.

We were greeted at the gates by a porter who took our bags, then directed to a wonderful seating area with iced drinks, basically check in comes to you.. this was the first time of all inclusive and after reading some of the reviews on here I was a little sceptical about the whole package. I should not of worried. There are bars, eateries and coffee virtually everywhere in the grounds and hotel. The grounds were absolutely amazing and so much space for a wonderful walk or just to have a different view. The pool (adults only) was amazing it was quiet, the staff were discreet the only disturbance was the water aerobics, that’s if you wanted to be disturbed for 30 minutes(no music just spoken…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2019,5,An excellent all-rounder,"Truth being told we were not sure what to expect from our stay at the Iberostar. We spent 5 days there following a shorter cultural stay in the Medina and were looking forward to a bit of pool/sun/easy food/fun. The weather was a little disappointing but the hotel management did very well to impress us. The grounds are impeccable, and the pools are extremely clean (a must for us) Our kids found a lot to do there and felt welcome all the way through the stay. A clever separation of pools/rooms quarters will discreetly park families with children away from some couples looking for peace and quiet. The rooms are actually quite simple (lay-out, design, but we thought many little things worked out well, such as the good beds, an excellent choice of TV programs, and easy…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2019,3,"Beautiful hotel, but SO Noisy!","This is a beautiful hotel. The grounds are vast and perfectly manicured. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and are always on hand. The food is varied and there is plenty on offer for all tastes. But it is just so noisy. You can’t escape it. The pool has music playing all day (the Zen pool doesn’t, but with a 12 year old, you are not allowed there. Something that is NOT made clear on any web page. Also this is the only heated pool. So kids and adults with kids have to slowly freeze in the main pool). So back to the noise. The bar area has constant music inside and out and live entertainment in the evening. Too loud to hold a conversation. All of this would be forgiven if you could actually go back to your room for some peace and quiet. Every night woken multiple times by…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Wonderful holiday,"This hotel is super! The staff are welcoming and helpful. The restaurant has a wonderful spread and choice of buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The chefs are really imaginative! There is also a special Morrocan restaurant that you need to book in advance - but well worth it! There are sports and animations each day for those who wish to participate and children of all ages are well catered for. There are also many evening events so if you are not a night-bird, it would be wise to ask for a quiet room! The bedrooms are spacious and well-equipped and I fully recommend this hotel.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

On our first day we were welcomed by Bashir at reception, he was very helpful and welcoming. The rooms were very clean. The food was delicious- especially on Moroccan night. The entertainment team was superb- they worked very hard to include everyone and make sure everyone was having a good time. A special thank you to: Khalid, Hamid, Morad and Rory. They were always so friendly and ensured we had a great time! Archery was lots of fun as was trapeze and 'Master Chef'. The zen pool was nice and relaxing.

We stayed in a basic room but it was absolutely fine, fresh towels and cleaned every day. Food and drinks were great - lots to choose from! One of the key things about this hotel is the staff. They cannot do enough for you, and I have to say a special mention about RACHIDA who was a lovely lady. The animation team are also good fun - they try and get you involved but certainly aren't pushy! All in all, a great hotel, for a good price, with beautiful weather. What more can you ask for!

No tea or coffee facilities completly empty mini bar although we where staying ""ALL INCLUSIVE"". No slippers or robes and we had two single beds pushed next to each other as a double bed. Food choices plenty in the main open buffet restaurant but dinning facilities are limited. Onlly one main buffet restaurant serving breakfast lunch and dinner and one A la cart only open in the evenings.

What can I say....this hotel is perfect for a few days break but I wish I could have stayed longer. Everything is lovely from the rooms to the grounds and especially to the staff. Hanane in reception is so lovely and helpful and Zyad in the bar is great and also Salah in the Zen bar is great. There are too many to mention but all of the staff go out of there way to be helpful and they are all happy to do so. The Zen pool is lovely and where we really relaxed. There is a spa at the hotel. Have a hamman and body scrub...amazing! The food is varied and lovely. There was a themed Morrocan evening with traditional music. The entertainment was good.

 March 2019,5,A heavenly oasis,"We are both rather ancient...and well travelled. For us this place was rather special. Check in was very relaxed and we were discreetly assessed, which led to us getting a room change in keeping with our mobility and getting re-assurance about my wife's lactose and gluten free diet. The site is immaculate and quite wide ranging, Some residents we met had never found the new lake or the driving range or the boules pitch etc. so much and all so pristine. The food was delicious and completely 'safe'. Finally the staff are so lovely. They like to anticipate what you want and provide it promptly. There seemed to be a basis of natural Berber hospitality refined by top class training. Thank you all.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

When I arrived there, it felt as if I never left the place and if I have to be completely honest it's even better. The weather was beautiful and hot. The marquee was still there if you want to eat outside, however in the terrace outside the restaurant is really nice to eat because you can see the sun going down and the sky beautifully red. The days are now getting longer over there When I arrived at the hotel that night after 10pm, the Porter said something about eating before I go to my room. As I was feeling tired I declined and said thank you for the offer and he took my luggage to my room.

The rooms were cleaned daily and towels changed. The gardens are kept beautiful. The food and drink was plentiful. The Zen pool is heated and was a great place to chill out. My only complaint would be the cat in the lobby bar at night time, I understand the cats been on the grounds of the hotel but I have a fear of cats so I couldn't relax in the evening time with the cat roaming around and up on the chairs. I didn't sit outside in the evening because of the cats and then couldn't relax inside because one kept coming in. All in all the hotel is fab and I would highly recommend it.

 March 2019,4,Almost perfect,"My husband and I have just spent 5 nights at the Iberostar Palmeraie - our first visit to Marrakesh. We were amazed at the excellent level of customer service that was offered to us by every member of staff without exception. The cleanliness of the hotel was second to none and staff worked tirelessly to ensure everywhere was spotlessly clean. The food was of a high quality - fresh ingredients, beautifully presented and plenty of choice. Good standard of local drinks. Gardens and grounds - an oasis of peace and tranquility. The only downside was the Zen pool- our experience was spoilt by children being allowed to use the pool - despite there being 2 others which they could use. Children should be allowed to laugh have fun and make noise - not in the Zen pool. Nor should adults…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 March 2019,5,Great week,"Having never been to Marrakech before we really didn’t know what to expect. The Iberostar was lovely from start to finish. It’s a way out of the main area but supplies a shuttle service several times a day. The staff couldn’t do enough for you. Bahir welcomed us with all the details of our room and helped us through our stay, right up to the last day. Room was very spacious and had a mini fridge and we had opted for an Atlas Mountain view. Our only complaint would be no availability of irons and ironing boards, there is a laundry service which we did make use of but availability of an iron would have been better. As we arrived in the middle of the day we made use of the spa and had the Hamman to get our bodies ready for the sun and then later in the week we went back for a full…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 March 2019,5,Totally amazing,"This is our 5th trip to Marrakesh and we decided to stay on a complex as opposed to a hotel this time. I can honestly say we were not disappointed in any way, the place was secure and spotless, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, the food was superb and although it is located away from the town, a shuttle bus was on offer to visit the medina. We will definitely be returning and would recommend to couples and families and also lone travellers. We used the spa and massage centre within the complex and it was a truly lovely experience.

Hey Rony- “Hassan high five”! There was lots of activities to do and plenty of swimming areas. Hotel & room was clean and had all the facilities we needed. Beautiful gardens around the hotel and they even had a little farm area with a few animals. If I was to pick something negative I would say that food labelling should have been better.

 March 2019,5,A wonderful place,"We have just returned from an 11 day stay and can truly say that we have never before experienced such a high level of service together with genuine warmth and friendliness. All the staff are amazing but special mention must go to Rasheda, Layla and Adranoui in the dining room and Zdan in the bar - they are amazing. The hotel is lovely and the grounds are beautiful. We couldn't believe the food, something for everyone. It was upsetting to see so much food going to waste - it was a buffet and so many people piled their plates high and then left half of it! The only negative we found was that we were disappointed in the Moroccan Restaurant. The main dining area served tastier tagines in our opinion. It is really hard coming from 25C to 2C and snow back here in Scotland.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We arrived on the 4th March in the evening and staff were accommodating, as food was still being served. Only downfall was that we were a group of 4 and had booked two rooms which were on either side of the hotel. We were a good 5 minutes walk from each other. Other than that, everything was amazing. Facilities were good. It was nice as not in season for kids, so it was not too busy. It was a shame as we had 2 really warm days and then the weather turned and it got cold.

Staff were amazing, couldn’t have been friendlier. Animation team worked really hard to get everyone involved and they even have their theme song. After a while you will remember the dance steps. Grounds and areas kept clean and immaculate by staff. We were allocated 2 rooms with a connecting door, both were kept really clean and spotless. There were only a pillow per bed, extras had to be requested. However, some of the furnitures have shown their age. Shows at night are generally really good. Our daughters loved the mini disco.

The staff make this hotel, they treat you like family. Bashir Who gave us a fab welcome when we arrived and Laila in the morning Who couldn't do enough for you at breakfast. The grounds are kept immaculate, rooms are clean but the smallest balcóny we have ever had. Ladies if you have long hair take your own hairdryer, takes a long time to dry your hair.

 March 2019,3,In the middle of nowhere,"I booked this holiday through Saga and as a previous post had said it is not a typical Saga hotel. There is absolutely nothing nearby you cannot go for a walk down the road which has a high wall on either side and is more or less a dirt track until it reaches the dual carriageway.There is nowhere to sit and read outside in the gardens in peace away from the constant music. The food is quite repetitive after a week no themed evenings and the Moroccan restaurant which you can book once in your stay had only a choice of fish or meat tagine,it was not a good experience and did not feel like a an a la cart experience.

The grounds are well maintained and there is a good choice of food, including vegetarian. Loved seeing all the wildlife especially the frogs, geese and hotel cats! I don't normally like petting zoos but the animals looked very well cared for and were lovely to visit. There is a lot of effort made here - it was international women's Day while we were here and every woman was given a rose and a glass of fizz. Highly recommended as a base to explore Marrakech.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2019,4,Great Holidays...BUT some suggestions!,"We loved the 5 days spent in this hotel. The atmosphere, the venue, the staff, all great. Something to improve is the rotation of the menu. The food is very good but very repetitive if you stay for a week. Another point to pay attention is about the animation team, a couple of the men were a bit “too friendly”and we found some lack of respect in some actitudes.

Having visited Marrakech previously, this time we wanted to stay out of the city, enjoy some winter sun and have a base to suit us all. I have to say this hotel ticked every box. Set in the Palmeraie area, it is around 15 minutes away from the city, set in a remote area with other hotels dotted around it. The grounds are huge with stunning, well kept gardens and paths, it's very pretty and a pleasure to wander. The rooms are simple, modern and comfortable, however the balconies are tiny so don't expect to be sunbathing out there. If you have young children the ground floor rooms are perfect for them to run around outside the terrace. There are…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 February 2019,5,Unique staff!,"We stayed here for almost all of February, booking through Saga. We are in our early seventies. This hotel is not a typical Saga hotel. However after reading the Saga description and tripadvisor reviews that was obvious. It is a family hotel first and foremost. But the price we paid was exceptionally reasonable. So my expections were not raised. That tends to start a holiday off well! As more often than not it turns out better than expected. As the title indicates the staff were unique. We have never stayed in any hotel anywhere, including far far more expensive hotels, and had such wonderful service, such kindness, courtesy, and desire to please.

Food was also lovely could of done with the being a bit hotter as once’s served it goes cold quick. There could also be a bar by the main pool as it was little annoying having to go back in the hotel for a drink. The entertainment for the 4 nights we was there was fantastic!!!!!

 February 2019,4,Extensive Property with plenty of amenities but better suited to families than couples.,My wife and myself are nearing the end of a 6 night stay at the Iberostar Club Palmerie which is located outside the centre of Marrakesh and it takes around 30 minutes to reach there from the Airport. It’s a little disconcerting for guests to be dropped off outside the main gate but - once inside - things work like clockwork with the Reception team providing everyone with a warm welcome. This was something replicated by most of the other Staff throughout our stay and this really is one of the Resort’s real strengths. The property itself is all-inclusive which is another reason behind its popularity (it was almost full throughout our stay) - as is the extensive Entertainment Programme. Both of these are clearly popular with families but it does at times make it difficult for…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,4,Iberostar Marrakesh,"All was excellent . Service was good on all inclusive holiday 31/1-5/2/19 . Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly , with special mention to James and Flores from entertainment and Rachida in the restaurant. No request was too much for them . Staff at reception were always helpful and made phone calls for us to local kart track. Food was varied and a good mix of Morrocan and European . Hotel was spotless and the special touch of hand disinfectant at restaurant entrances gave peace of mind to the guests . The pools were clean and the gardens kept tidy . The weather was our concern as we expected it to be cold in February but it turned out to only be chilly in early morning warming up to sun bathing weather after mid morning . Rooms also have heaters if needed . We look…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,2,Not the same standards as the caribbean,"I did not find this hotel to be amazing as other reviewers. The moment we arrived no one helped us from the gates of the hotel with our 3 luggage suitcases and the taxi was not allowed inside for security (I understand and appreciate the safety but then staff should be called to come out and help us). When approaching the entrance the workers standing there STILL did not even help us. At the front desk they asked that I forward the confirmation email to them...I said why? Can't you look me up by my name? They said no. odd. After checking in, again, no one helped with bags to our room. They rang a bell to call someone for assistance but after 10 minutes of no one arriving we asked for our keys and carried everything ourselves. Everyone speaks French at this hotel and its…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Best holidays,"Hello, I am in the hotel for the second time and will probably fly there every year, that's how I like it there. I was there for 10 days with my little daughters and I can not fault it. The food is delicious and the selection is so big everything is fresh made you can see how they prepare the food. The personnel is very friendly and courteous! All the staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful. The management was always on site and was very attentive to the guests in the hotel and tried to make everything possible. You can book many akitvitäten in the hotel are safe and on time.

 February 2019,4,Brilliantly run hotel with top-notch service and standards,"Our family of four (two boys aged 9 & 10) spent February half term here last week and absolutely loved it. The staff and service was incredible. The atmosphere was very positive, happy, relaxed; all helped by the friendly and personable staff, striving to be as helpful as possible. We were able to find the perfect mix of relaxtion and entertainment: chilling out on comfortable sun loungers around the main pool (mainly empty because the water was freezing at this time of year, but the smaller adults-only Zen pool was heated - and was allowing kids to swim here, as half term week, if they were well behaved!), or in our large suite which was impeccibly clean (with a daily clean) and well furnished, or a family game of cards in the bar in the evening. Or we could join in the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Fantastic break,"Myself and two friends spent a short break at the hotel last week and thoroughly enjoyed our trip. I have visited Marakech before but wanted to return..... so glad I did. The hotel itself and grounds are fantastic and the food is good also. The staff are incredible, we were made to feel welcome from the minute we arrived at reception and we’re shown to our comfortable room. The day time is filled with activities and the nights are vibrant. The entertainment staff are all great fun and very talented putting on a different show every night which the guest obviously enjoy. Rony is especially superb and really engaged with guests making sure everyone is having a fantastic holiday.

 February 2019,5,Amazing hotel run by wonderful staff,"Have just returned from a week with our family of 5 and could not recommend highly enough. The grounds are beautiful and huge, the rooms very clean and comfortable and the food was exceptionally good, with so many options at each meal. There are lots of on-site activities, sports and shows and there is camel riding and quad biking literally just across the road from the hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and work exceptionally hard to make sure you are well looked after. A special shout out to Roni who could not have been more helpful to us and who my three boys were absolutely taken with- his dance moves were a definite highlight, and to Abdel who made sure our wine glasses were always full. Was the best Feb half term ever and hope to return one day.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,4,Fab winter sun holiday!,"Just back from a 10 day stay at this hotel and loved it. Loads of activities to participate in or a nice laze in a cabana by the pool. Weather good apart from 1 day of rain. Entertainment was very well put together, kids disco first and a variety of shows each evening. Lots of crowd participation encouraged. Valentines evening was thrilling. A real surprise to be met with a cocktail reception and the hotel being valentine themed throughout. It felt really special. Shuttle bus into Marrakech was handy but beware of being ripped off. I bought what I thought was Frankincense resin. I even asked to smell it being burned before buying which smelled like frankincense but came home with a bag of something resembling blobs of plastic. We went all inclusive and were very…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Perfect Family Trip,"Read all the wonderful reviews before we went for our Feb half term break and we weren't disappointed! From the taxi you arranged from the airport to the adjoining rooms so I could keep an eye on my 3 boys! Nothing was too much trouble. Every single member of staff deserve praise - they work so hard and always smile and make you feel special. My husband had a fall whilst playing football and they were amazing with us, offering help and bandages/cream etc Thank you for making our Marrakech adventure! We enjoyed the whole experience from beginning to end Laila in the restaurant deserves a special mention ... a wonderful lady! Thank you",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2019,5,The perfect family holiday,"Family of six stayed at this brilliant hotel in January 2019 all inclusive. This hotel exceeded all expectations from the moment we arrived and went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and had a wonderful holiday. Let me be clear, what stands this hotel out is the level of customer service. All the staff from the manager to the receptionists, waiters and bar attendants do a great job to show they care, whether that's checking to see if you need a new drink or making recommendations, they are the main reason the hotel is so highly rated. The food is good, plenty of variety on all meals and the Moroccan themed night was great too. Chef's were very accommodating and dishes provided cater for most. Kids pool is ideal especially during the day to keep the little ones…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,4,Perfect stay !! Specially for families!,"We just came back from a week holidays in this hotel and this place exceeded our expectations. The staff are very helpful and nice from the receptions guys to the General Manager (Mr Walid) whom I had the chance to chat with. We had 2 interconnecting rooms, they were spacious , comfortable with stunning bathroom design. The food was ok but we were expecting to be more ""spicy"" and having more taste in it but I guess it was prepared for ""tourists"" , nothing too hot or spicy. We had a choice of Moroccan + eastern cuisine so everyone had what they wanted. Plenty of choice at the beer to chose from, drinks were very tasty. The Beer could be a bit stronger though lol Had to jab about 10 to feel a bit drunk lol Now coming to the entertainment team , they could do better to be honest…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2019,5,The staff make the place,Stayed here for 2 weeks in January! It was just amazing with the most helpful staff I have ever met! The food was a bit basic but Hajji and his team in the restaurant could not do enough to help you and just went over and above what was expected! The rooms were simple but kept immaculate by the wonderful housekeeping team. We would definitely return!,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Awesome staff and amazing hotel experience!,"Stayed here in February and the weather was still hot. The hotel was very clean, spacious, well organised. The room (double pool view) was immaculate with a great view and all we needed. What made this experience so good was the hard working staff. From the people on reception to the manager and cleaners, they were so helpful and kind. They all smiled and were there to help whenever we needed. The entertainment staff were top class and did everything from the cookery demonstrations to the zumba and pool exercises. There are so many activities to take part in and the shows in the evening very entertaining. The dancers were awesome, all of them! There is a good balance between relaxing and joining in the many activities if you want. The staff are not pushy but…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Excellent hotel set in lovely grounds with numerous bar and restaurants. The restaurant is amazing, so much choice and the food is so fresh and delicious. Our room was a good size garden room, located close to the pool, and clean and comfortable. There was a choice of pools, all with plenty sun loungers, along with lots of sporting activities located throughout the gardens. Found all the staff really friendly and helpful.

 February 2019,5,Some welcome February sunshine...,"We booked our trip to Morocco during the BA January Sale to find some sun in February. The weather didn’t disappoint and neither did the Iberostar Club Marrakech resort. The service provided by both staff and management was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The facilities were extensive, well maintained and the restaurants were remarkably clean. The Zen swimming pool was our location of choice and where we spent a lot of time winding down after our house move just before Christmas. I was so relaxed my automatic watch ceased winding and the mechanism stopped. The restaurant staff could not do enough to look after us, always with a smile. The food was excellent which meant we looked forward to our meal times. The drinks included in the all-inclusive deal were excellent and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Amazing!,"The Hotel is excellent. Everything you could want or need and nothing is an issue.

What an amazing holiday!!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Perfect trip for winter sun,We stayed at the Iberostar for a week in February 2019. The all inclusive resort had everything we wanted. Without exception the staff were welcoming and friendly. The accommodation was very comfortable and clean. The food was excellent and the facilities well maintained and organised. We used the regular shuttle bus into the centre to enjoy the 'chaos' and fun of the main square and souks. Thoroughly enjoyable and one of the few places we would visit a second (maybe even third!) time.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel - generous sized rooms and bathrooms - well furnished and exceptionally clean. Beautiful well tended gardens. Food and Drinks of very good quality and wide selection to suit all with daily specialities and themes. Staff throughout this hotel from the reception area, restaurant staff, bar staff, cleaners even the gardeners are all extremely pleasant and friendly- nothing is too much trouble. The managers are very interactive with guests, visiting the pool areas and the restaurants checking everything is perfect. Great hotel for a relaxing break but also good location for sight seeing - free hotel shuttle bus into Marrakech several times daily - well worth a visit - highly recommended- we will be returning.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,"Amazing food, great stay","First of all I would recommend arranging transport from the airport to the hotel. As a single person who hadn't been to Marrakesh before I found the whole taxi thing very intimidating and if they can rip you off they will. Rather frustrated that the hotel did not reply to an email I sent via the Iberostar website a few days before about transport options. Anyway, once at the hotel I was welcomed and asked to sit and complete a registration form. The guest relations manager, I think his name was Hassam, came and sat down with me and explained fully about the facitilies and the food and drink etc. He then escorted me to my room. He was charming and a credit to the hotel. I had to pay 100 dirhams at reception for the pool towel which is refunded on departure when you hand over…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,A great hotel,"Only our 3rd day here but feel I had to take time out to write something as we have been overwhelmed with the hospitality. We have done all inclusive a few times but this is thw best experience to date as it includes some cocktails, a good selection of spirits but more importantly crepes, waffles and far more for the kids. Huge selection of food, it may not vary as much as other places but that's because the huge selection is available at all meals. Some of our kids are fussy but they are still doing fine with the choices. What really makes this hotel though, is the staff. They are fantastic, a good laugh, very friendly and a credit to the hotel. That goes for all of them, not met a grumpy one yet and there's usually always one.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Excellent and well managed hotel,"We stayed for a week at the start of February and were sorry to leave. The secret of the hotel I think is the excellent management - Hassam and his team are constantly walking around the hotel talking with guests and asking for feedback. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the staff are excellent and can't do enough for you, and meals are both varied and very good quality. I was less impressed with the Moroccan Restaurant and thought the excellent tagines available everyday in the restaurant were far better, but that's a personal view - it's very popular and needs to be booked a few days in advance. Beer, wine and cocktails were also very good. The gardens and pools are well maintained and as ever only spoilt by idiots leaving towels and clothes on their preferred spots. We had a…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Many thanks to all the other brilliant staff. We went for a winter break but didn't expect such lovely weather, and also were a little sceptical on what types of facilities may be available due to visiting out of season how ever we were shocked by the amount of gym classes and activities on offer. There was always something to do! Even the snack van was open all day every day, something which we thought would be closed out of the summer months.

 February 2019,3,"Lovely hotel, shame about the noise","Visited Marrakech for a break from the cold British weather and we weren’t let down by the Moroccan weather. Hotel set in lovely grounds and 2 good sized pools for adults (one heated but still on the cool side). Staff were exceptionally friendly and catered to all of our needs in the restaurant (affectionately nicknamed the canteen for the week). Good choice of food, though hot food was often cold. Excellent seafood choice on one of the nights and food generally very tasty. Entertainment during the winter months appeared to be in the main internal bar which lacked character and atmosphere due to the bright ceiling lights that were constantly on...easy to remedy by dimming down the lights. The big downside for us was the noise from neighbouring rooms and corridors outside the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,Fantastic Winter Break,"Just back last week after a fantastic winter week at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech. The standard of service and the friendliness of the staff from the minute we arrived at the hotel to the time we left was excellent.

We stayed all inclusive and were very happy with the standard of food and the quality of drinks ( alcoholic and non-alcoholic) that were available .

 February 2019,5,Would definitely stay again,Just returned from this hotel and would give it 10 out of 10. The hotel is spotlessly clean. The staff go out of their way to be helpful and friendly and to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Good selection of food in the buffet restaurant with local dishes and freshly cooked food. Gardens are immaculate. Free hotel shuttle bus available at certain times into the city. Just make sure you know where the drop off/pick up place is. Lovely to get back to the tranquility of the hotel after the hustle and bustle of the Medina. Plenty of sunbeds. :Heated adult pool could be a bit warmer. Cool in hotel at night but good heater/air con in room. Overall great value for money.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left I have nothing but praise for this hotel and it's incredibly hardworking staff! And you will see from my other reviews I say what I see. Upon arrival we were checked in promptly. Given a welcome drink and had the amenities and facilities of the hotel provided to by the hotel manager ( very hospitable and friendly). The rooms were spotless - every day. The hotel and grounds are immaculate. The staff take great pride in their work and I could not fault the cleanliness of the hotel.

 February 2019,5,Fabulous,"Our very first trip to Morocco & I’m just enchanted by this place. The hotel is a little out of the way, but that suited me fine. Just wanted a week of rest & relaxation. The staff here are wonderful. Happy, smiling, helpful, friendly, very hard working but always well presented. The food had a very good choice every night & I’m a fussy eater. I wasn’t overly impressed by the themed restaurant, I felt it lacked atmosphere - but that’s just personal taste. The room we had was nice, the walls are maybe a little thin& I can imagine in the height of summer when it’s full, it may be noisy. But when we were there it was fine. Housekeeping were great.

 December 2018,4,Very high quality hotel,"The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, the decor is lovely and all done to a very high standard. The room was spacious and luxurious, especially for the price paid. The food was also great, lots of choice for an all inclusive and there was a good mix of different types of food. The pool area was very nice too, it never felt crowded or busy and food and snacks were available all day. My only criticism of this hotel was the noise - I would absolutely stay here again however I would request a food in the block further away from reception. One of the bars downstairs played music outside, very late into the night which isn’t ideal when travelling as a family as it was very loud from our room. I did have to make various calls to reception during our stay to ask them to turn it off…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2019,5,What a wonderful holiday.,"We have just returned from a absolutely wonderful 7 days at the Iberostar Club. Pity we had to return home, the hotel is spotless in every aspect. The food in the all inclusive restaurant is varied, with something for everyone. The pastries at lunch and evening are to die for. The staff are all helpful and very friendly, this from the reception staff, cleaners, bar staff and management. On the day we arrived, there was no power to must of the lights in the room, young lad turned up and within 30 minutes all power was restored. They cannot do enough to ensure you have a wonderful holiday. Yes there are lot on French using the hotel.

 November 2018,4,Great if you like all inclusive,"We stayed here for 4 nights in November 2018 after having spent 3 nights in a Riad in central Marrakech. We decided we didn’t want to spend a whole week in Marrakech and thought we’d come here to relax after a few days. The hotel is great for drinks and for relaxing by the pool, doing the occasional activity (which there are plenty of), if that’s your type of thing. Unfortunately we didn’t realise this was not what we wanted from a holiday until we experienced it. As the hotel is a way out from town, we felt restricted in our movements and had to go out on excursions only. This is just our experience though and nothing the hotel has done. Generally the hotel is amazing and put a lot of thought into everything for its guests! We are not a fan of all inclusive dining as it was…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2019,4,"Friendly staff, good all round hotel with very good grounds and leisure facilities","Visited with a group of 10 golfers so spent most days away from hotel until late afternoon.

TV with usual channels and small balcony with table and 2 chairs at least in 1205. Three pools one main by hotel, one for kids and a quieter heated pool ideal for winter sunbathing. Kiddies playground, table tennis, golf practice net (plans for a mini course), 3 x pétanque bays, fitness centre which didn't use and dancercise sessions.

 January 2019,5,Perfect 4 night stay,"Stayed here with my partner for 4 nights at the end of January and had a wonderful time. Cannot think of any way in which the hotel could be improved for the price we paid. Our room was clean, comfy and a good size with a really nice view of the pool right outside. Both of the main pools were beautiful and very clean with loads of sun loungers and extremely comfortable beds to relax on. Even though the zen pool is quieter and intended for adults, we preferred the atmosphere and music around the main pool. The restaurant is amazing, so much choice and the food is so fresh and delicious.

The hotel has 318 rooms set out amongst nice gardens, clean and well kept. Our room was very nice, big bed, flat screen TV, a safe, wardrobe, although not enough hangers provided, two round pin sockets. We took a travel kettle as there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Mini fridge provided - empty except for one bottle of water on arrival. Bathroom big with very good walk-in shower, hairdryer, shaving mirror, nice toiletries. Bedding and towels changed each day and lovely and clean. This hotel is wheelchair accessible.

When we reached our hotel/resort, Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech, it was about 12.45 pm. We were given only one room on the ground floor to put our bags in and informed that two other rooms were still being cleaned/readied. We were asked to have lunch as we had booked an all-inclusive holiday. The staff were very kind and helped us with the check in formalities. We proceeded to put all our bags in the room we were given. When we tried to put all our passports in a locker, we discovered that the safe/locker in the room we were given was broken. We therefore kept the passports with ourselves. We then had lunch, got the keys for two…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2019,4,Great Vacation,We stayed here for 8 days in January and had an excellent stay. There are only two restaurants: a buffet and a Moroccan restaurant (which you can only go to once during your reservation). The buffet was fine. Food was sometimes not hot but I think that was because of the low-season as the resort wasn't busy at all. Lots to choose from and changed the theme every night. A couple mornings we missed breakfast (ended at 10am) and had to wait until lunch was served (1230). A continental breakfast was advertised but only a few light pastries were provided. We didn't make our reservation for the Moroccan restaurant but I'm sure it was good.

 December 2018,4,Al inclusive hotel,"We were booked into the Ibersostar as part of a golf trip to Marrakech. It was a different experience for us as the hotel is quite distant from the city centre and means that the all inclusive element becomes important. The restaurant is buffet style with a wide selection of foods and cuisine types and it was all perfectly fine. Standard drinks were included and the staff were all very friendly. There were a few blind spots such as not always getting clean towels in the room, but overall the stay was good.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2019,5,CAN’T BE BEATEN ON VALUE FOR MONEY,"On arriving at 9 pm at the Club Palmeraie we couldn’t have been made more welcome by the staff and were immediately escorted into the restaurant for dinner before we checked in. We had e-mailed beforehand and requested a ground-floor garden room – a wise choice as it was convenient for the main restaurant, bar, terrace and main pool with other facilities/activities close by. There are connecting rooms for families. This was the second week in January and we were prepared for the cold morning and evening temperatures – coats and jumpers a necessity – but by 11-ish the sun shone brilliantly - it was shorts and T-shirts time plus sun-screen for the sun worshippers. The very large unheated main pool was naturally empty, but with plenty of sun loungers around it was fine for…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2019,4,Winter sun,"Spent a week late January. Overall a worthy stay at the Iberostar. Room: Bigger than expected and comfortable. We had a twin room although told we could request a double if required, we didn't. Only thing is the beds move alot. There are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room a shame because it would have been nice to enjoy a coffee on the balcony with a lovely view of the garden. Bathroom: Big bathroom with usual amenities. Fresh towels everyday and spotless. Bar: A lot of drink options, not as strong as you'd get in UK but still very drinkable. Food: Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served buffet style. Good selection of different foods. Sometimes amazing, sometimes bland but cater to the masses. The Morrocan (Jewara) restaurant was a bit of a let down. We went to 2…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 January 2019,2,"Poor experience, do not recommend, never again","This hotel is far away from 4 star rating. I will give it 2 stars. Listed as a brand new hotel, it was actually inherited 20 years old unfinished construction. And it feels, pretty run down in many areas. Rude personal. Lady on reception keep saying inappropriate jokes to me. Moroccan restrain is only one once a week, so we couldn’t enjoy it. Everything available ONLY at extra cost even with all inclusive package. Spa was expensive but sad experience too. They don’t even give you a towel or hairdryer, so I need to use my clothes to wipe my wet hair. Pools were very cold to swim in. Lunch was awful: cold hot dogs with flies all around. Very hard to get in. It is far away from the town, and nothing is around. Luckily we only booked this hotel for one night, but were ready to leave…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

A different world to a hotel I stayed in Hurghada two weeks ( Hawii Le Jardin) previous. The staff all were very hospitable, the hotel was clean and stylish. The food was good quality and there were good amenities such as Tennis, football, Archery etc. and it was well organised by staff. Overall the Hotel was very well managed and staff were very friendly. Few minor improvements as below : Other all inclusive hotels provide free sauna and steam room but the SPA was separate and charged quite a bit to use the Sauna and Steam. Sports equipmenst were not adequate so they need to upgrade Tennis racquets and supply more arrows for Archery ( we had one arrow per person).",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2018,5,Fantastic Staff,"I stayed over Christmas Week with my wife, 2 daughters and 2 grandchildren and i have to say that the staff were brilliant in every aspect, from the cleanliness of the rooms, to the variety in the restaurant, to the friendly bar staff, to the energetic entertainments team, nothing was too much trouble and everything was done with good humour. There was even a small zoo with goats, fish, peacocks, rabbits etc for the kids. Zen pool great for adults, and paddling pool great for the grandchildren. It was my wife's birthday on Boxing Day, and we went to the Moroccan restaurant, again staff were great and a birthday cake was produced at no extra cost.

 October 2018,3,Shame about cold family pool!!,"Visited this hotel over the October half term with our 12 year old daughter. Much of this review was ‘clouded’ by the mixed weather we had which I appreciate is hard for most hotels to manage. The biggest influence on my review was the lack of a heated family outdoor pool or an indoor pool when weather is inclement. Swimming is always a big part of our holiday and it was a shame that our daughter could only swim occasionally in main pool which quite frankly was very cold for the whole holiday, there was never more than 2 or 3 people in the pool and the lifeguards often outnumbered the swimmers! I suspect this would be the case for several months of the year having stayed at other hotels in Marrakech in February. Frustratingly there is a heated pool exclusive to adults and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2019,4,Amazing value for money,"A week at this hotel/resort was very enjoyable. The food is excellent with many choices and lots of changes from day to day. Chocolate fountain at breakfast! All sorts of things to do on the site which is some way out of the town, which can be reached in around 25 minutes by free shuttle bus. Plenty of sporting opportunities, badminton, Table tennis, boule plus two swimming pools and a splash pool for children. However, it was chilly/cold a lot of the time and this includes parts of the hotel like the main foyer and corridors. Bedroom was very good with individual heating which worked fine. Spacious and comfortable. Hotel is cleaned continuously throughout the day and is spotless.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Having arrived at the hotel from stepping out of the transfer taxi the service we received was beyond our expectations, they made us feel at home and couldn't do enough for us to ensure we where comfortable and our baby was ok. It was quite late but we where still taken to the resturant to get some dinner before doing any of the check in formalities. All the staff are VERY baby friendly and people friendly the service is amazing and you are made to feel at home everyday.

 January 2019,5,Great Little Oasis,"We loved our 10 days at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie. We were looking for a bit of Winter sun and were not disappointed (despite the cold mornings!). From the warm welcome right through to the warm send off, the service was the best I've seen anywhere. Whether or not it was a management policy or that the staff were just so pleasant - either way the staff were all just excellent. We really the rooms which were tastefully decorated and a good size. The balcony was quite small (narrow) but this was more than compensated by the wonderful shower - so important to me! We're pretty easily pleased with the food side of things so we found what was on offer very much to our tastes. My only small gripe was that the soup was always tasteless (needed a lot of seasoning) but I still had it…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

From a welcoming happy birthday chant as we entered breakfast, to a birthday cake at dinner time, my mum continued to proudly tell us all that this was her best birthday yet and this was thanks to the wonderful staff and arrangements made by the hotel. The manager was always present and extremely friendly and informative and the staff that work here are amazing beyond belief.

Both the Christmas eve and New years eve gala dinners were exceptional .Management were so concerned when I had an upset tummy and were constantly asking if I needed anything.

There were lights, christmas trees and even a Santa, who arrived on a camel with gifts for all the children.

 January 2019,5,Excellent hotel,We have just returned from a weeks holiday staying at the Iberostar over New Year and what a brilliant time we had! The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for you - the food was amazing!! Be prepared to put on a few extra pounds!! The only negative was the large pool wasn’t heated and was too cold to swim in at this time of year. We ended up using the “adult Only pool” even though we had 2 children with us (both age 10) as other families were doing the same thing - it just meant we had to limit the noise that the children made whilst in the pool. Great entertainment on New Year’s Eve - will definitely be going back again.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 January 2019,5,Exceptional hotel and staff,"We just returned from a four day stay at the hotel and it was absolutely brilliant! Firstly, I would make a note about staying at the hotel with an allergy, as this was something we couldn’t find much information on ahead of our visit (aside from another TripAdvisor review), and hopefully we can reassure others with allergies. My partner has a severe allergy to nuts, and we were worried that this would be an issue in being able to eat the food at the hotel (given the language barrier and local cuisine). This was a concern and we were wondering what processes were in place regarding allergens. On arrival, the allergy was mentioned and the staff immediately proceeded to fill out a form with all of the details, with the hospitality manager speaking with my partner and even taking…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

There was another lady (who welcomes people to the dining room) who also helped me and was very kind when my baby was unwell one of the days. I didn’t catch her name but she is an asset to the hotel. Virtually all the staff knew my baby by name and all genuinely cared we had everything we needed throughout our stay. The bar staff are great too.

My room was clean and well maintained. Only thing I didn't like about the room is that the bathroom door does not have a lock! Not great when you're staying with two other people in one room. My only real criticism is the food and this is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. It's very hard for someone who has allergies or restrictions in their diet to eat here.

The shuttle into Marrakech was really useful and took you into the heart of the city. Nothing was too much trouble. Everyday all the staff would greet you with a warming smile, and their attention to your stay was second to none. From the top down, everyone went out of their way to ensure you had a good holiday.

 December 2018,4,"Very Good, hope to return soon",Rooms and balcony small but perfectly adequate. In our case three adults shared a room one on a couch bed and we were all comfortable. Clean and well looked after with lovely bathrooms. All the rooms in the hotel are exactly the same size so the only choice that one needs to make is the location in the resort. If you book a room very close to the main hotel there is noise at night. Personally I would not recommend a pool view as in most cases you can only see it in the distance. Having stayed in numerous all-inclusive hotels I would rate the food here as four out of five for this star rating. This hotel is not expensive and superb value for money.

There is a lot to do within the hotel itself, with three pools, a gym, a spa, special camps for children of different ages, as well as a terrifying (!) trapeze, boules, archery and lots and lots more.

Hassan the deputy manager was also equally hospitable. Entertainment & Clubs - The animation team were jolly, young and lively.

The facilities are perfectly decent, if not luxurious, and there's some good cooking going on, especially of Moroccan food. Good value on an all-inclusive package with cocktails, house wines (Moroccan) and beers as well. But what makes the place really special is the uniformly utterly lovely staff. We were even rescued by a couple of them when we were lost in town and being mildly hassled; they saw us, shooed off the pest and put us in a cab.

The pool areas and the gardens are well kept, just watch out for the pesky stray cats, they leave you alone majority of the time but they can creep up on you.

The reception staff took our cases and took us straight through to the dining room and told us they would check us in to our rooms while were were eating and just to pop back and pick up the keys. A lovely touch. The food was incredible. Fresh, plentiful and a good variety. Drinks, although all inclusive were very good, wine from bottles and cocktails made with fresh ingredients. Staff were great, helpful and attentive. Rooms and public areas all clean. Had a lovely time and nothing really to complain about. Highly recommended",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2018,5,Just great....,"My husband and I booked this hotel for a week to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. What a wonderful week it was! The hotel is just beautiful. The grounds are well kept and the areas are clean and tidy. We spent the week pretty much at the Zen pool which is the adult relaxation pool and pure relaxation is available in abundance! No music, no children and after being given a small tip at the start of the week, Salah the pool bar waiter brought us fresh drinks, without being asked throughout the day. He could not have been more attentive or polite. The food is good and I am an extremely fussy eater. Restaurant tables cleared immediately and the staff work tirelessly throughout the sittings to ensure everything runs smoothly. My only slight criticism would be the only evening…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2018,5,Amazing Greeting,"Four of us arrived last night to an amazing greeting by the staff, champagne and nibbles, we have only been here one day and are amazed by how attentive and friendly the staff are,the place is spotless and the selection of food is unreal. We came here to celebrate my 70th Birthday and were given a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake and the restaurant staff all sang happy birthday to me, outstanding, if the rest of the week goes like this ( which i think it will ) we shall have a brilliant time, our rooms, 2230 and 2224 are really spacious and very comfortable, well done to all of the staff here. 👍👍👍👍👍",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 November 2018,5,You won't be disappointed,"Visited here in Nov 2018 for a friends birthday bash. I was a bit dubious at first, having stayed at, apparently, 4 star all inclusive hotels in Egypt. However, I could not have been more wrong. A lovely place, with great facilities and friendly staff. Above all, the place was spotless. The standard of the food was very high, and the drinks very good,The spirits were good, and the wine excellent for an all-inclusive.I drank the water in the restaurant and ate the salads,had ice in my drinks and didn't have any stomach upsets (unlike Egypt!) The animation staff are always around, and run a number of activities during the day, as well as show at night. There is also a ""nightclub"" from 11pm to 1am. Couldn't really advise for kids, as we were there out of school holiday season,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,50th Birthday Celebrations,"8 of us - all females, stayed at this hotel for a short break to celebrate my sisters forthcoming 50th birthday. From the time we stepped through the door till we left they staff were wonderful. The rooms were clean & tidy, bathroom a fair size. The food was plentiful and you would struggle to find something you didn’t like. The entertainment staff, James, Mohammed, Chicken-legs (his nickname) were just a few that made us feel welcome & kept us laughing. The hotel grounds were clean & tidy, pools very nice & they also have a trapeze should you wish to try your acrobatic skills. Would love to go back again.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 December 2018,5,Nice winter break,"We are currently coming to the end of our stay at the iberostar, we can honestly say this is a very clean hotel, with great staff who pull together to make your stay pleasurable. Rooms are cleaned daily with fresh towels, food is of good quality and varied for different tastes, the hotel is set between the lovely gardens which are nice to walk around and kept to a good standard by the staff, There is a adult zen pool which is heated which gets quite busy as it is a bit of a sun trap. One larger pool which is not heated with soft music played in the background. Star entertainment staff are always around if you wish to join in well that's OK but if not interested there's no problem they will not pester you they appreciate you are on holiday to relax which is good.

 November 2018,5,Amazing getaway,"Stayed here for only 3 nights and it was nothing short of amazing honestly. The hotel exceeded my expectation, pictures online don’t do it any justice. I have nothing negative to say about this place, literally spot on. It’s so beautiful and the staff are extremely friendly, not just with guest but you can see they’re also close with one another. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will be returning 1000% and for a much longer stay.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Great to relax,"Enjoyed short 3 day break to get some much needed rest. Sunshine was a huge bonus too!

 November 2018,4,Short break with friends,"We booked Club Palmaraie for a break with friends, on arrival we loved the hotel and the reception area. Check in was fast and friendly. We were late arriving due to the lengthy immigration procedures at the airport, so We were checked in and ushered into the restaurant for a late dinner. Our room was spacious and very clean, plenty of room for cases and clothes. The beds were good if a little too hard for our taste but we slept well until the morning chorus first thing which was very loud. Breakfast was great a good choice if prepared foods and cooked to order, the service in the restaurant was very efficient and friendly. We booked in at the Moroccan restaurant but although the surroundings were lovely we preferred the main restaurant for the variety. It was too cold to sit…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,4,Nice hotel but a few improvements needed,"Overall we had a lovely holiday and I must say that check in was effortless and the staff were mostly very efficient and helpful. The rooms are clean and spacious but corridors very noisy at night, best to bring earplugs. We enjoyed the heated Zen pool but some mornings the bar wasn't open, I had to chase staff to open up, one day it was well after 12. Food was rather disappointing. Great if you like garlic, most everything seems to be covered in it. I lived off salad, soup, pizza and chicken and chips and the best thing of all were the freshly made doughnuts at breakfast. Not everyone likes garlic! All the veg were smothered in it making a proper meal impossible for me. I didn't starve but compared to other Iberostar hotels I stayed in it was a let down. There is…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,4,"Great Staff, Good Food...Entertainment..maybe not so.","We returned yesterday from the hotel. As the title says, we could not be happier with the staff. From the minute we arrived at the gate and were helped to get our cases into reception. Fatima, in reception, immediately made us feel at ease and the whole check in process was seamless. The reception area is stunning. Your eyes are drawn up the amazing painted ceiling and huge chandelier, all in a beautiful Moroccan style. All the while, the scent of Fleur D' Orange fills the air. You feel so relaxed after your manic drive from the airport. We went to our room and our cases were brought to the room, so no heavy lugging of your luggage. The room was a standard room which was kept spotlessly clean but unfortunately didn't over look the stunning gardens of the hotel. Instead, as you…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Superb customer service,"Stayed on an all inclusive package through Thomas Cook and loved everything about this fantastic hotel. The staff are superb and can't do enough to make sure you have the best possible time. The bedrooms are well appointed and like the rest of the hotel are spotless. The hotel sits in huge, beautiful gardens that are lovingly tendered by a small army of staff. There's a huge choice of excellent quality food in the airy restaurant, there's a dedicated Morrocan hot table with lots of delicious local delicacies which we really enjoyed. You would be very hard pushed not to find something on the menu at breakfast, lunch or evening meal. Remember to make use of the shuttle bus and don't be afraid to explore the city. A sense of humour and a smile goes a long way here. The square at…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Would highly recommend this amazing resort,"Stayed here with my husband, all inclusive for a ten night getaway. What can I say - the resort is amazing - beautiful gardens, immaculately clean. The adult quiet heated swimming pool was lovely, we used it lots ( even in November ). The food was great - and yes it was a buffet but there was always plenty to choose from and the menu was varied on a daily basis. The food truck was great for an afternoon snack. The staff were friendly, welcoming and enthusiastic from morning to night. Lots of sports activities throughout the day and a show every night to ensure that we were entertained. I would highly recommend this little oasis in Marrakech. Thank you to the Iberostar for giving us some very happy memories to take back to the UK.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,Great Value with the All Inclusive Option,This resort is a really great value with the all inclusive option. They offer many amenities and activities. The food was generally good for a buffet. Many food choices and they consistently changed the selections the whole time we were there (5 days). The customer service was excellent. Really friendly staff. They also offer a shuttle to and from town (near Jemaa al Fna and the entrance to the souks. You have to book the shuttle the day before. Be very careful when at the souks or anywhere within the Médina. This is the only place I’ve been where I was really concerned for our safety. It is sad that this place has turned into a haven for organized scammers and gangs. Just google scams in Marrakech. We saw it first hand multiple times. It is sad that the shop owners tolerate…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Best holiday in a while!,"We stayed for 2 weeks at the end of October and it was brilliant. As soon as we walked in we were looked after. They sorted our rooms whilst we went for lunch so there was no waiting round at reception. Throughout our stay the managers were always around, talking to the customers and making sure everything was okay. We chose to go to the zen pool when sunbathing as it was a child free zone and a great pool to relax by. Salah the barman was absolutely brilliant. Couldn’t do more for us! Never had a gin missing from my hand... The entertainment team were just brilliant. Even though there days are incredibly long, they were always full of energy. There were activities each day which the entertainment team got you involved in. Ayoub, Yousef and Morad were just brilliant with us,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We were given a lovely warm welcome on arrival and went straight into lunch whilst reception sorted our rooms. We then headed straight for the Zen pool to relax and chill out. Salah Zen pool barman / waiter ensured that we were taken care of all holiday whenever we were at the pool. The entertainment team did a great job throughout our stay with a wide variety of different activities and shows each day, encouraging us to join in especially by Ayoub and Mourad.

 November 2018,4,Guest Relations,"A good Hotel with good food and service. The rooms were basic but ok, maybe need a little updating. The Guest Relations Manager Imad EL KHAOUDARL was outstanding , he helped us when our transfer to the airport didn't show. He seemed to keep the hotel running communicating with the other staff.

 November 2018,4,Excellent 10 day November holiday,"We have just returned from a 10 day 'All Inclusive' holiday having stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech from the UK. I'll start with the good points: *Spotlessly clean. Our room was cleaned everyday thanks to a lovely cleaner to a very high standard. The reception, dining room and outside areas are also spotlessly clean and staff was always cleaning. *Friendly staff. Some staff can talk better English than others, and things do sometimes get lost in translation, but the majority at least know the basics of English and you can get your point across most of the time. *Lovely food. Wide selection of food at breakfast, lunch and dinner. *Good security. There's a barrier on entrance, then security patrolling the grounds day and night. *Cute little farm at the back…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we were treated so well. We didn’t get to experience all the hotel had to offer as we spent most of our days out enjoying beautiful Marrakech so I wish we’d had longer.

Looking forward to returning soon",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,5,JUST FABULOUS,"This was our second visit to the Iberostar and was instantly recognised by Imad the Guest Relations Manager, was good to see a familiar face. As we arrived late we had dinner and was then shown to our room. I have a silly phobia about being on the ground floor and was told if we could stay in the room allocated for 1 night we would be moved the next morning. True enough Imad pulled out all the stops and offered us the best room possible Rm 2229. Spectacular view of the gardens with the Atlas Mountains in the back ground...fantastic. There were so many plus points I could go on forever but here's just a few that will stick in my mind: The reception staff are very polite and helpful assuring you of their best attention at all times.

 November 2018,3,Ideal for outside of Marrakech stay,Stayed for a week based on previous reviews and it was fine. It is about 25 minutes outside of Marrakech but has free shuttle buses a few times a day or taxis. Hotel staff are great and friendly. Rooms are clean and spacious but small balcony’s. We had an outside facing room which meant lots of dog barking from local farm/fields throughout the night. Adult zen pool was lovely and warm but the staff do let kids in there! Food is repetitive and didn’t keep its temperature between the food area and table. Bedroom towels could be better. Also they promote recycling and reduction in plastic yet use throw away plastic drink cups and straws!! Evening entertainment was poor. If you want a few days of rest in the sun by a pool outside of the city but near enough to go into Marrakech…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2018,4,Excellent place,"First week in November 2018 Very clean complex, food is excellent a large variety of local foods and of course chops, pizza and pasta for those who are to shy. The staff are very friendly at every level. I would advise ear plugs as the rooms are not well insulated. Sadly the entertainment team (great bunch) spend a lot of time with shows. Personally we would have liked to dance instead of sitting down watching. They do get you up to participate but that only lasts 5 minutes. Just a small detail",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We spent ages reading all the TripAdvisor reviews for this and other nearby hotels, and we definitely made the right choice. For ease, we've broken things down into bullet points. ** Food and drink The food, generally, is excellent. The buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner offer a good variety, with several options cooked fresh to order, and while some options are always available, there are enough new things offered each day. Definitely try the Moroccan themed restaurant, which offers a tasting menu. At lunch, remember to check outside for the barbecue, as this is often good, but sometimes we forgot because it's out of the way.

As the grounds around the hotel are vast plus a small farm in a top corner for children (consisting of a peacock, swans, chickens and a sheep) nothing is on top of each other.

Things I think might be improved, breakfast food could be hotter and frying eggs is a simple skill but still requires care and some interest in the result. Although I asked them to flip the egg, (over easy), I never got an egg where the white was cooked. I asked for a pancake from the hot plate to be heated up and was told it was hot, no, it was just very slightly warm. An unusual lapse where customer service was really impressive here.

The kids animation team (Starfriends) were incredible with our kids, and a special mention has to go to Chicken Legs, who my daughter took a particular shine to! We never felt that the attention we received was anything but genuine, the people are all so nice from the grounds maintenance staff to the manager. I have never seen a hotel where the staff were cleaning as much as this one, the corridor outside our room was mopped 4-5 times every day!

Everything was dealt with very professionally and I just needed a couple of stiches. The staff were extremely caring and concerned for my welfare, I felt they did the best they could for me. The only thing I would add to this comment was that the swing doors to the ladies toilet in the pool area need oiling/loosening off so that they're not as stiff to open. Our arrival on day one was marred somewhat by the very long delay at passport control at the airport - approximately 2 hours.

The manager immediately got us all our “all inclusive” bands and allowed us to eat our much needed lunch and allowed us to check in at our leisure afterwards. The entertainment Staff made everyone feel welcome without being pushy for the activities. Although there was no need to be pushy as the activities were all ones that our family loved taking part in - there is even a trapeze you can have a go at.

Good points include staff that are keen to make your stay as wonderful as possible; rooms that are well maintained, very clean, and beautiful to look at; lots of lovely food; heated swimming pools.

Plenty of activities to do through the day. shame the golf is just like a driving range and not a crazy golf course as this could be beautifully intergrated into the gardens and would be a great addition for families, kids and adults to enjoy. Room was excellent and always clean. Hotel about 20-25 mins away from the city but free shuttle bus fairly regular.

 October 2018,3,Nice hotel but disappointing,"Lovely hotel, but I wouldn’t advise staying if food is a important part of your holiday. The food - the food genuinely ruined our holiday experience. It was very repetitive with the same food being served everyday, across both lunch and dinner. This wouldn’t have been so bad if the quality of the food had been better, but we found it to be mediocre at best. It was also even more limiting for vegetarians as there was no labelling of vegetarian options, and little choice. We hoped to have some change when we booked the morrocan restaurant, and was very disappointed to find this was the exact same food as served in the buffet. Thomas Cook - not entirely their fault but the Moroccan government decided 2 days in advance not to put the clocks back. However, despite being aware the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2018,3,Not good not bad,"The hotel itself was really nice. Very nice welcoming and the staff very attentive at first. As we arrived quite early in the morning, our room was not ready but, we could enjoy the hotel facilities in the meantime. However, once we did the check-in everything was downhill. The staff did not show us where the room was either escorted us to the room or informed us about the restaurant times and bookings. So we were lost almost 15 min trying to figure in which direction the room was. Once we got it, there was made as a twin instead of double bed - so calling to reception to ask for what we have paid. The man at reception was kind of rude and sharp but he sorted out :), which was OK. The second day, we put the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, but guess what? The maids cleaned…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2018,4,Good hotel; outstanding service,"I stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie for 8 nights with my mum back in July/August 2018. This will be pretty long, so I have split into sections for ease. Arrival/check-in: We were greeted with a cold, refreshing juice drink which we sipped while completing the paperwork. We were given a map, and some basic info re meal times, and then taken to our room. Room: On opening the door we were greeted with an awful smell of sewage/stagnant water. It was really quite horrible, and so the porter phoned down to reception to ask about changing. Cue some back-and-forth phone calls between the porter, myself and reception, where I was finally able to establish that no other rooms were available. Air freshener was suggested but I'm asthmatic and my mum has a chronic lung condition so…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,4,Good on the whole,Good hotel with plenty to do and lots of room. It's big. Meal times are well managed but very busy. It's a shame that people smoke right outside the restaurant so if you don't smoke you can't eat outdoors. The mattresses were quite hard. But the rooms are well arranged so that they are quiet even during the day. The free hotel bus which runs to Marrakech every hour does drop you a good 10 minute walk outside the town center. But on the whole a good place.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff","Just returned from a week's stay. The hotel was spotless. the grounds were beautiful and the staff were unbelievable. We stayed mainly around the zen pool (no kids) and although busy it never felt overcrowded. There were lots of children there and they looked to be having a brilliant time with the different clubs and activities in offer. They also had activities for adults starting with morning 30 minute stretching class to spin classes, zumba, aquazumba and petanque. The staff were always polite and helpful and making sure that every one felt included and part of the 'experience'. The room was very comfy and the free wifi was great and I could stream shows on my ipad which is unusual for free internet.The dining room is spotless and the food choice is extensive and changes…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,4,As expected from Iberostar,"I have stayed in many Iberostar Hotels in various destinations which was the reason fro choosing the Palmeraie. From the minute I walked through the door to the moment I left I felt at home, the staff are attentive and friendly and the hotel was very well kept, all in line with others I have stayed in. The rooms were spacious and had lots of wardrobe space, beds were very hard but didn't seem to affect my sleep or back. It is worth noting, if you go onto the balcony don't close the door to keep the air con running otherwise you will be locked out. I saw a few people calling passers by to let them back into their rooms. The food was a very good standard albeit a little repetitive. The meats were cooked well and there was enough to please everyone. The pools were kept very…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,"Excellent, Staff cannot do enough for you","Just returned from a one week stay here. The hotel is excellent, very clean and the grounds are beautiful. Would definitely return and would recommend to all. We spent most of our time around the Zen Pool which was quiet and relaxing, but for those with families there are two other pools which are accommodating for all The food was excellent and whilst there was some repetitiveness as other reviewers have mentioned, there was always something different each night, and a different ""theme"" which means there was always something new to try A special mention to one of the waiters, Adraoui, or as the other staff referred to him as (in a nice way) the ""Old Guy"". He went above and beyond and really made a difference to our holiday with that personal touch. Always smiling and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,3,Not a 4-star hotel,"We stayed at the Iberostar Palmeraie for 4 nights in mid-October. The hotel grounds and common areas are all nice and well tended. Sadly I cannot say the same for the room which was in serious need of repair, and nothing like the photos on the hotel's website. The furniture and fittings were old and worn out in places. We had to regulate our use of provided toiletries (shampoo and shower gel) as they were not replenished daily. Obtaining pool towels required a trip to the reception and a 100 dirham per-towel deposit. I have never had to pay a deposit for pool towels in any other all inclusive hotel I've stayed. Overall this was not a 4-star hotel experience. Food selection, as other reviewers have mentioned, is broad but becomes repetitive quickly. Drinks felt watered down and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,3,Sadly since my review in July 2017 Gas gone down hill. Victim of own success,I have been to this hotel 7 times . Twice yearly as I USED to love the quietness.. went with my husand and 2 friends I do not think they will be going back. We go for the Zen pool . However the rues such as no inflatables . and no under 16s . I pay to go there so I shant anymore. Also the food is back to being almost the same everyday! All of us got diahhorea and vomiting whist there. Staff are still lovely Rachida especially. I am sad,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,4,4 deserved stars...yet the food was sadly disappointing,"I agree with much of the review from Archer1129 below. We have just returned having stayed for 3 nights as a couple. Our teenage sons ventured off to Center Parcs with the grandparents and we joined them for their final day upon our return to the UK. This hotel has so many admirable qualities and that is down to the fabulous staff and management team. The staff appear very engaged and motivated and that’s a credit to everyone. They work hard, are always proactive in speaking to their guests and want us to have a memorable holiday. Well done to every single member of the hotel team. The swimming pools are terrific. We opted to stay around the Zen (adults only) pool which was tranquil and as heated was a lovely temperature in October. The facilities within the stunning grounds…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,4,Very Good Hotel - Few alterations and could be an excellent hotel,"Recently just came back from a weeks holiday here, booked through Thomas cook and found out they have only just started coming here. We have previously been to Marrakesh around 4 years ago but stayed at a different hotel, it is a really lovely country and would recommend. Positives:- The Iberostar hotel is spotlessly clean and has the absolute nicest hotel staff! They truly work so hard, really friendly and nothing is too much trouble! Hotel rooms are perfect for a weeks holiday, spacious, comfy beds (all twins), fridge, hairdryer, safe, great air con, small balcony, good wardrobe space. With it being October the hotel wasn’t to full capacity (apparently only 500-600 guests, when they have 1,000 in July/August, even though the weather was stunningly hot and sunny of 30 degrees…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Great hotel top class,"This is a wonderful hotel, very clean and tidy Staff are super friendly and if you tip them a few pounds they will really give you a great service. Three pools one is a zen pool and very relaxed Kids pool with slides and family pool all really clean. It's mainly a French hotel but Thomas cook has just took over so more English going now. Taxis outside the hotel, £10 to get into marrakesh. The free shuttle bus drops you off a good 20min walk from the madina, it's very hard to find your way and you run the risk of being harassed or robbed. Easy lost tourist Try and share a taxi with other guest from the hotel it's much easier Also beautiful black&white kitten who looks out for fish Situated by the zen pool gardens",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,4,Pretty good!,"My husband and I have just returned from a 4 day break and although we enjoyed it and the hotel was immaculately clean, we are still ill after the second day in. The food was good with plenty of choice but unfortunately being ill made the experience less enjoyable. We had a trip into town to the markets which I have to say was not to my taste, we were harrassed as soon as we stepped off the bus with so called guides although this did not bother my husband. The hotel was very accommodating with us having a late flight on our last day and gave us a complimentary room for half an hour in order to have a shower ready for our flight. All staff were lovely and very friendly and would bend over backwards to help with anything. I was a bit disappointed with the spa treatment I booked as…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Great Moroccan Retreat That Has It All!,"We have just returned from a one week visit to this amazing resort in Marrakech. On arrival we were greeted with roses and fizz. No queuing at reception, our wristbands were put on and our cases were taken straight to our room. We noticed as the week went on, the different welcomes provided by the hotel to different nationalities which we thought was very slick and a really nice touch. Our room was lovely and special mention had to go to the cleaning staff for always doing a great job. We had clean towels and the room was made up every day. You’ll see from the images the lovely towel arrangement left on the bed for us on our final day. Such a lovely gesture. On our stay we booked an excursion via Thomas Cook. When we returned to the resort later that day there was fruit and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Friendly and efficient staff,"My husband and I went to this hotel for 4 nights last week. We did not know what to expect as we had not seen anything about it. To our delight the hotel was clean, friendly efficient staff and also activities you could join in if you wished. We were a bit disappointed that our Atlas Mountain view was limited to our balcony stretching your neck to see it and not from the bedroom as expected. The food was very good and we took advantage of meals provided. Hotel staff kept the hotel spotless and were always on hand in the restaurant. Taxi's were right outside the hotel so you could go into Marrakech very easily about 30 mins away. We had a wonderful taxi driver who assisted us all afternoon for a very reasonable charge. The pools were not heated so a little cool. We would…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Shining Example of an Iberostar,This hotel is a fantastic example of a reasonably priced all-inclusive experience. Every night the food buffet was stocked with plenty of options and the rotating options (although a bit sparse) were also delicious. Throughout the day other snacks were available so we never went hungry The staff were very (and sincerely) friendly and always happy to help. They weren't too invasive and the grounds were always very clean and tidy. Being only 30 minutes away from the city centre meant it was quiet and the hotel provided regular inclusive shuttle buses throughout the day so it's no burden being away from the hustle of the main city. Only negative aspect was that stereotypically of an all-inclusive the drinks and cocktails felt a bit watered down. Would definitely recommend!,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,The Geese 😀,"We normally stay in the medina area or Gueliz area but as our granddaughter was joining us we looked for more of a family hotel. We weren’t sure about being so far away from centre but my goodness we were thrilled with our choice. We had watched a helpful video on YouTube presented by a previous guest to give us some idea of what to expect. In reality we were delighted with our choice. There really is something for everyone including zen pool for peace, large pool for activities and fun and children’s fun pool. Different activities all day. Then we have the geese 😀, firstly we we afraid of them as they rush towards you if the spot you, making a very loud noise. We thought they were going to attack us but no, they are just after something to eat. I fell in love with them and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,3,"Nice hotel, strange customer service from staff.","Stayed for four nights last week. The hotel rooms are modern and clean with a great Moroccan style bathroom. The main pool is large, bigger than it looks on the pictures, and looks onto the hotel grounds which are stunning. The architecture of the hotel is great. Drinks/snacks available around the pool all day but they do attract the wasps. Restaurant food was nice, good standard but was the same each night. Lots of variety though. Delicious cakes. Great cocktails. Hotel have a free shuttle bus to the Médina but beware when catching this back to the hotel it does not wait. We caught the 18:30 bus and by 18:31 the bus was on the move. Negatives were: staff have a very silly sense of humour which was irritating when they are playing around not giving you the drink you ordered.…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,4,Autumn getaway,"Hotel, pool, rooms and general areas very clean and tidy. Only let down is the WiFi signal needs to be improved. Zen pool rules still not auctioned by the lifeguard, if you have rules why not enforce them. Otherwise recommend.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2018,5,Great Resort with Great Staff,"You know what? This was our last choice! Why? I don't know! But from now on, it will definitely be our first when we want to go to Marrakech to relax. This is a great resort believe me. Nice cared grounds with lots of green and wild crazy ducks and lots of birds all over, great two pools being the Zen Pool our main choice because we wanted to rest and you really can rest for its super quiet, great Restaurant Buffet with lots of Morrocan tasty, I mean really tasty Morrocan food, awesome theme Restaurant Jawhara with food that will make you drool and get an explosion of flavors in you head.

 October 2018,4,Not the best Iberostar I’ve stayed in.,This is advertised as a 4* but is a little tired. In my opinion it is overdue refurbishment. Rooms are basic but clean. Pool areas are lovely but didn’t feel heated. There’s an adult only pool which is a great idea for those that want peace and quiet. Food is good although a little repetitive. Wouldn’t want to be here for two weeks. Located 20 minutes from markets etc and hotel offers free shuttle bus. Warning: make sure you ask for a map as we got lost and were unable to find anybody that spoke English. If all you want is a cheap break in the sun then you won’t go wrong with this hotel. If you want luxury choose 5*,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Lovely Hotel for families,"Just returned from a very enjoyable one week stay. The staff are all very helpful and kind, the grounds are constantly cleaned the garden is beautifully kept. The buffet is varied and plentiful, it is constantly restocked and made to look stunning. Kids very much enjoyed the trapeze like real circus profs. My sons birthday was made very special by all the staff of the restaurant bringing his birthday cake and singing. Even though he was at first a bit overwhelmed, he did like the attention in the end, so thanks to the restaurant team! Three suggestions to make it even more perfect; the main swimming pool ladder, get it fixed! The restaurant lighting is way too bright... (the outside eating area is lovely though!!!) A real bonus would be to introduce a more ecological approach,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2018,5,Changing hotels could not have worked out better!!,"I went to Marrakech with two girlfriends. We were not originally booked into this hotel but due to poor reviews on our planned hotel, last minute we decided to swap to the Iberostar. I can genuinely say it was the best decision we made. The hotel was lovely, clean and very well maintained. We were greeted personally when we got to the hotel with a drink and an overview of the hotel by the receptionist. It made a nice change from standing in a queue to check in! The manger introduced himself to us and everyone that arrived and the staff were very attentive and welcoming. It was my birthday when we were there and they manager and the staff could not do enough to help me in celebrate. It made my day even more special. We did not want for anything.

 October 2018,5,Great hotel and location,"We can hardly fault anything about this place. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived but they took our cases, gave us drinks while we waited and directed us to the restaurant until we could go up. The whole place is spotless and the room plenty big enough with a huge bathroom. The only gripe we had is that we were on our honeymoon and were given twin beds. When we questioned this we were told that out of 300 rooms they only had 3 with double beds in! However we went down to the pool and by the time we had returned they had turned our bed into a double for us. The staff were all friendly, loads of free sunbeds no matter what time you went down to the pool and the food was plentiful and varied including plain choices of pizza and chips if you didn’t want anything a bit more…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 September 2018,4,Almost perfect,"Firstly, a huge mention to General Manager Imad who is is rightly very proud of the beautiful hotel he runs and his hard working staff team. He remembered our names from day 1 and always took time to stop for a chat when he saw us - a very nice personal touch indeed. We thought the hotel was immaculately clean and the facilities fabulous. The maids worked so hard and even decorated the bed one day with beautiful flower petals. The cocktail bar was great for a chilled out drink and there were always plenty of available chairs and tables in all the public areas. The food in the main restaurant was delicious, freshly cooked and varied. The Moroccan restaurant was however a different experience and although beautiful and cosy inside, the food on offer was poor with no choice…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 September 2018,4,Lovely Hotel,"Spent a week all inclusive (unsure whether other board options are available as booked through on the beach, not direct - as a tip, this might be worth checking as it worked out about £300 cheaper than Thomson). The hotel was really nice and clean with modern touches throughout, and the staff were extremely friendly and polite. The food had a good variety, and was all nicely cooked, and the free drinks included were great! If you wanted international brands, these were available at a cost, but the local spirits/beer was nice enough.

 September 2018,4,Nice hotel but needs some little touches to make it 4*,"Nice hotel and very clean. The cleaners and gardeners work all day everyday to keep the place spotless and they do a fantastic job. The grounds of the hotel are nice and there is lots of activities to do throughout the day to keep you busy (as it is not near the main town - but that is only a bus ride away and the hotel provide this). The animation team are great and do not hassle you if you do not wish to join in. I do think this hotel could do with a few extras to make it 4* as advertised and these are: - Kettle & iron in the room. - Waiters to serve drinks in the restaurant instead of self service. Day time I agree with self service but not the evenings. - The pool bar only serves beer, wine, water and fizzy drinks but no other alcohol.

The food in the Main buffet restaurant was good, plenty-full and varied. We booked this hotel independently for 5 nights all inclusive, not everyone is on all inclusive but it seems nearly all are. It seems like the hotel caters mainly for 2 week package holidays booked by Thomson and various other European agents, they arrive as groups together and get a tour of the hotel by a rep. We did not and therefore had to work things out for ourselves which was a bit annoying. Check in was confusing and they forgot to book us into…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2018,5,Excellent All Inclusive Hotel,"This is a clean, well run hotel which has a good range of facilities and excellent food. Other travelers have commented that the food is repetitive but I can't support that view, there is a degree of repetition, given the huge variety offered each day, but there are also lots of different options each day including a number that are freshly cooked whilst you wait. The staff were invariably very polite and helpful and whilst some were, not surprisingly, more comfortable speaking French all made every effort to understand and respond to requests in English.

 September 2018,4,Lovely Hotel - would recommend,"Stayed for only 3 nights, 4 long days. Came for a Hen Do - five girls. Check in was slow and took a while to find our booking which is irritating when you are very tired. The reception area is immaculately clean. We booked two rooms which were again immaculately clean and really great rooms. We stayed on an all inclusive basis. The cocktails weren’t great but it did depend on who made the cocktail. The spirits/mixers were very good though. Buffet included very good quality, great tasting food however it didn’t seem to change day to day.

 September 2018,4,Would recommend this hotel,"Overall, our experience of this hotel was very good and we would definitely recommend this hotel to others. From the start, we read other reviews where people had said it was a slow process getting through immigration and we were expecting to be waiting several hours. This was not the case. Yes it was slow, considering we were the only flight and it was about 9:30pm, but we got through in a reasonable time frame. The airport itself is very nice. Very clean and quite an attractive building from the outside. It is a reasonable 30-40mins from the airport.

I will not repeat what other reviewers have said regarding the general services instead I will comment on our individual observations and experiences. But firstly I must congratulate the manager who arranged, with the pastry chef, to make biscuits for cheese especially for us after we remarked that there were no biscuits/crackers to eat with the aray of cheese's at dinner. We were so pleased to see all the biscuits made (using the recipe for Jacobs Cream Crackers apparenlty) all went very quickly so the demand is there and I do hope biscuits with cheese will now be offered at every dinner service.

 August 2018,5,10 fabulous days,"I spent 10 days here in late August with my Wife & 13 year-old daughter and we all had a great time. We chose this hotel because we had stayed at an Iberostar before, albeit 16 years ago, and wanted to go to a 'decent' hotel... and it did not disappoint... It's located about 25 minutes from the airport (book direct on web rather than using Easyjet / Ryanair option as it's about 1/3rd of the price) and the journey takes you through the palace estate & past the Madina so it goes in a flash. The plot that the hotel is on is huge... and the various activities that the entertainment guys put on are located all over the place (i.e. driving range, archery, basketball, football pitch, 2 tennis courts, 3 table tennis tables, 3 or 4 boules lanes etc). The food at the hotel was…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2018,5,Excellent holiday.,"This was a one week stay at this hotel in late August. Staff friendly on arrival with welcoming drinks which were refreshing. We were shown to our room. We were a late check in and so the restaurant was closed, however without asking they served us food in our room which was a nice touch. The room was clean and tidy. Breakfast we had plenty of choice to suit all. The hotel has 2 pools,one is called the Zen pool which is the quieter pool and then there is the main pool. This pool is more active with games and music. The Zen pool seemed to have plenty of sun beds. You can get food poolside which included an outside food truck which served burgers, hotdogs, waffles, pancakes, cakes and drinks including beer. However when we did eat there we did get swarmed by wasps. Lunch and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2018,3,3.5/5,"My partner and I returned a couple of days ago from this hotel, on first impressions it seemed good, very clean, reception staff very polite and attentive, nice touch to have fresh juice in reception at all times. The rep was helpful, however I’d reccomend shopping around for prices of excursions, as with everything in Morocco these are negotiable! Our room was very clean and a good size. The whole resort was kept beautifully clean, we constantly saw maids/cleaners etc keeping everything under control. The food was good, plenty of variety, and always something for everyone - a nice touch to have the Moroccan restaurant, definitely reccomend this, the food was delicious!! There was a good selection of alcohol and cocktails too, most things included! It was nice to have multiple…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The hotel itself is kept clean and is well presented, the staff in the hotel work their hardest to be of service from dawn to dusk - a credit to the management and the Iberostar name. The hotel manager ensured he spoke with us daily to make sure the holiday was all we expected it to be. He also took on board any constructive feedback in relation to our stay. My wife and I enjoyed the evening pianist/bar singer, though it is a shame his sessions had to end at 2245 due to ?noise - especially as you could still hear the fun/music from the entertainment area well after 2345. The animation team worked hard daily to encourage even the most reluctant participants to the endless daily activities. Food and drink…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We had the most fantastic holiday and are already looking to book again next year. We were very sad to leave. Whilst the hotel is immaculate, set in beautiful grounds with spacious rooms, what stood out for me was the hotel staff and the Animation team.... these are what made our holiday so special. They honestly cannot do enough for you, and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need and enjoy your stay.

Spent a week here with my teenage sons and we had a lovely time. the hotel is lovely, helpful staff, clean room etc. internet was a hit and miss but this didn't seem to be a hotel issue but improvements would be helpful. I wasn't very impressed with the food, however, and some improvements here would be good. But the hotel is lovey, and the grounds beautiful and well kept.Great swimming pool. I booked thro LoveHolidays which was fine but I strongly recommend not to book a private airport transfer as it it much too overpriced and the driver actually never collected us from the hotel on the way back to the airport, which was a disaster! best just to grab a taxi when you arrive and nae sure to negotiate a good price.

Before the trip, I was quite apprehensive after reading so many mixed reviews - most were positive however I was concerned with some of the comments people had made about issues such as wasps, food, language etc. I have to say, my fears disappeared from the moment I walked into the hotel. The staff and receptionist were so welcoming and there were drinks available to us if we needed it. We had adjoining rooms which were immaculate and clean. As we arrived at around 8pm, we went into the restaurant which is an all inclusive buffet. The restaurant is huge and the choice of food was really impressive.

 August 2018,5,Pretty perfect!,"We have absolutely loved our stay at the Iberostar Marrakech. This was our first experience of an all inclusive hotel and we were a bit nervous, but we had a fabulous time there. Whilst the hotel is relatively big, it never feels like it is, probably because of the spacious immaculate gardens (do explore, there is a path taking you around), the 2 pools and the layout of the hotel (low structure) with rooms spread between 2 buildings. Lunch and dinner were smooth affairs too, and we were always able to find a table in our preferred spot. Please note the hotel is 15mn away from the town centre. For us, it was a godsend, as we were able to dip our toes into the wonderful & charming chaos for a few hours and then go back to the peaceful oasis that is the hotel!

The hotel is just outside the city, we were greeted and our cases taken , reception told us all about the hotel and facilities then the hotel guest relations manager talked to us , made us feel very welcome and amazingly remembered everyone’s name in the hotel, good trick as that again makes you feel special.

We had such an amazing time here and would definitely recommend this resort. If there have been any bad reviews about this resort then I cannot believe it. I would love to return to this resort and would love to take my extended family next time. I have broken it down in a few sections of what I thought: Staff: Well what can I say I have been to so many different countries, so many hotels and this has to be the best in terms of the customer service.

She decided that she was now too old for kids club but we saw how they interacted with the children. They tried to get her to go but to be honest, most of the children were French so she wasn't really interested and wanted to stay in the pool all day. During out 10 night stay, she did find a couple of English children her age and had a fabulous time. Our room was 2030 in the far building and was very clean.

Being a vegetarian, I am always nervous about ensuring there is enough food, but there is something for everyone! They had themed nights in the restaurant, where they would cook dishes from different restaurants, but they also always had basically salad dishes, meat options, vegetables, and salads The pool was massive with lots of sunbeds to choose from.

The food was great with a different theme each weekdays, cocktails were ok and some were premixed but hey you are on holiday. The Star friends were amazing and always smiling and trying to get you involved. The hotel management were always there to greet you for breakfast, Lunch and dinner which I haven’t noticed in any of the hotels before. Nothing was too big for the staff.

Imam, the manager, seemed to know all of the guests by name and remembered which language to speak to when talking to them (very impressive). Our daughter was sick one day and he was very concerned and said to please let him know if there was anything she needed (also the restaurant manager asked if she'd like any particular food prepared for her).

As you can imagine it’s always hard to pick a holiday which will cater for a family with 3 kids (6 years, 5 years and 1 year old) it was reassuring reading the reviews for this hotel.

I was slightly worried about our stay after that but the food in the restaurant is fresh and there was lots of variety. We had a pool side room which was loud up until 11pm but was really convenient for getting to the pool. There are 3 pools, the best one for us being zen as it was quiet and lots of space.

The food was plentiful and varied, we were there for 11 nights and didn't get tired of the food, the entertainment was excellent and something for every age. We will definitely return to this hotel.

 July 2018,5,Amazing,"Fabulous hotel, clean and welcoming. The staff cannot do enough for you and nothing is an issue. Food was amazing and plenty of choices even for the most fussy eater. With the main swimming pool for entertainment you also have the zen pool for over 16 if you wish a quieter surrounding. Lots of entertainment through the day and evening. Plenty of different places to get a drink too. The staff work so hard. They also provide a free shuttle bus into the town. If you get time for a trip the the water falls Ozoud it’s well worth the 3 hour trip to get there. Not for those who cannot walk far as it’s approx 600 steps down and then of course 600 back up. You also go on a small boat at the bottom for a few moments plus you get the meet the hungry Barbary apes. Fantastic place and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Fabulous hotel,"This hotel caters for everything you could need, from specialised meals to suit catering requirements to all you can drink all inclusive. The rooms are clean and well presented staff come in daily to tidy and replenish as needed. The staff are very curtious and friendly, they can't do enough for you.

 July 2018,5,Highly Recommended,"Just back from a fabulous weeks holiday at this hotel. I can't recommend it enough. The hotel itself is immaculate - clean and well kept. Amenities are excellent, I went with a group of adults and stayed around the adults only Zen Pool however it seems that they really make an effort with the kids here. Gardens are beautiful. Sporting facilities good. Food is fresh, well made and the choice is excellent. I've previously found on all inclusive holidays that the alcohol is disappointing, not here. The wine is lovely, the cocktails are not watered down and made in front of you. Spirits are good and provided in generous measures. During the stay, we attended the White Party around the pool, and also the management cocktail party. Both offered generous amounts of rather nice…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2018,5,"Great Food, Great Staff, Great Rooms, Great Time and only one negative.","This hotel is a really great hotel for an all inclusive, the quality of the food is great and I love the fact that this hotel celebrates Moroccan culture in its food and themed night etc. Staff are nice and friendly and I must give a special shoutout to Mustapha in the dining area who looked after us very well and was very attentive at all times. I would advise people after breakfast to take a walk every morning around the beautiful gardens ( just follow the jogging path). The rooms are loverly and clean, beds are good and the pillows are fantastic. To summarise this is a great hotel. There are access ramps in many places, so that a wheelchair would be able to access many places. You won't be disapointed at this hotel. Now the negative..

 July 2018,4,Lovely hotel,"Currently enjoying a 10 night stay here. Good points are: The hotel is lovely, with modern rooms equipped with a digital safe, toiletries and satellite TV. Way above other 4 star hotels. Food is excellent, plentiful choice covering traditional Moroccan, grilled meats and fish, plus plenty for kids. Fantastic hotel for children. The staff are so active and find plenty for them to do, all the way up to age 17. Staff in general are so welcoming and bend over backwards to make your stay enjoyable. There are a couple of small things that prevent this hotel being perfect. They are truly small things and may not matter to everyone but for me: Drinks. The alcoholic drinks menu is not brilliant, and quite a few of the spirits are of poor quality. Also the poolside food truck sells…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Iberostar never disappoints!,"We’ve just returned from a 3-night mini break - excellent stay in the scorching sunshine! The hotel is beautiful, the staff work very hard to make sure the grounds are lush and immaculate. The food was all very fresh and plentiful - great breakfasts, continental style salads with delicious breads and a range of hot dishes every lunch and dinner. The special Moroccan dishes on our last night were gorgeous and the chef even took time to give my husband a recipe! This is a French speaking country - and the clientele are predominantly French - but as travelling anywhere, an attempt at a few words is very well received and the staff were all very approachable and thoughtful. Our garden view room was lovely - very spacious and spotless! We booked a couples massage in the spa for…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,What a lovely resort!,This was our first time in Marrakech and it was my husband who chose this hotel this time. We don't normally go 4 star so weren't sure what it would lack from the usual 5 stars we stay at. Upon arriving to Morroco the passport control was terrible and very slow so once we got to the hotel we were very tired and hungry. We arrived late and were greeted by a lovely manager think his name was Iman. He was very friendly and brought us some tea and juice. The hotel grounds were beautiful. We were then shown to our room which was a standard garden view. We had to ask them to change our bed to a double as they were set up as two single beds. We asked the room guy and he set this up for us for when we came back from dinner which was nice. The staff were all lovely and very friendly…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2018,4,Early break,"Second visit to this hotel it just keeps getting better. Staff are fantastic and great to see a lot of the staff are still working at the hotel since our last visit. It does make a difference when you know the staff are enjoying their work and not just going through the motions. We like to to totally relax so we used the zen pool everyday, the quiet adults only pool. The young waiter at the zen bar was very attentive he soon knew your drinks of choice and ensured you had these when you wanted them. The food was fantastic lots of choices and very well presented. The rooms could probably do with a makeover but they are very clean and comfortable. We will be visiting again. Well done to everyone at the hotel and thank you once again.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2018,5,Service with a smile.,"This hotel deserves the excellent reviews it gets on this site. It is very clean and comfortable. The drinks at the bar on the all inclusive tariff were of very good quality and we never waited more than a few minutes to be served. Enjoyed the food very much and it was good to have a couple of micowave ovens should you wish to reheat it. The hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech itself but there is a free mini bus ,which runs several times a day, operated by the hotel to take you to the city. There is a small library above Reception area on the first floor. Swimming pools are wonderful. There is one for kids with a water slide. The main pool, where activities are held, and the quiet adult only pool which is heated in winter. The bedrooms are nicely…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2018,4,Family Fun,"Fantastic stay! From the very moment we arrived, the hospitality was great from all staff. The Guest Relations Manager regularly checked up on us and remembered our names, he exceeded all our expectations! I have listed below our main positive and negative experiences: Positives: - Clean and modern grounds and rooms (still Moroccan themed) - Constant entertainment for all ages from the Animation Team - Food is served every hour of the day. Even when it is not breakfast, lunch or dinner, snacks are available. Negatives: - I felt as though the food was repetitive every night, a little more variation would be welcome. However, there’s a lot of choice. Alcoholic drinks were also quite weak.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2017,4,"Very Welcoming, Buses to Marrakech Centre- Nice Location Away From the Hustle & Bustle!","On arrival, staff were friendly and welcoming. I met the manager on arrival, who seated me at a table outside whilst my room was being finished off, and sent a waiter to bring some Moroccan tea. It isn't as authentic as you will find in the souks, and if you visit or stay with a Berber family, this tea is the best! Served very sweet, with mint. The manager obviously questioned why I was on my own, looking at me as if I was some secret magazine reviewer :) The hotel is about 20 mins from the centre, so no that much of a journey and there are mini buses from the hotel, if you don't want to grab a taxi. Always remember your drop off point and pick up times; you can easily get lost.

 June 2018,4,Great hotel,"Mixed feelings about this hotel as some amazing friendly staff who would go out of their way to help you, apart from the reception team who do not seem to care about your concerns! Room was adequate but we did not have a double bed in our room which was annoying. I did visit reception to say about this and he did not seem to care, we also had no water in our fridge as promised on arrival and after 14 hours of travelling we had to go and get our own when all we wanted to do was have some sleep. The noise from our room which was 2144 at night was awful dogs barking and I did not get a good night sleep at all! I have stayed in many Iberostar hotels and this has been the one that I would say that needs much more modernisation and attention to detail. Saying all this the staff that…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 May 2018,5,"Great hotel, fabulous staff","I stayed at this hotel with girlfriends for my 50th birthday. It’s a gorgeous hotel with great staff and facilities. As soon as the staff found out it was my birthday they kept arranging little treats for me such as a birthday cake, singing ‘happy birthday’ every time they saw me and giving me a bottle of celebratory fizz! There are 3 pool areas, one for kids, one for music & activities and a quiet pool for adults only with no music and it’s own little bar, so something for everyone. In particular the animation team manager Abdul, the Zen pool attendant Yousef and one of the restaurant staff members Raschida were fantastic.

We stayed for a week and from the moment we arrived were amazed by everything and everyone at the hotel. The food is simply amazing, great quality with lots of variety including speciality nights when you could choose to have Lobster, King Prawns, Sushi and many more different things– honestly this is the best all-inclusive food we have ever experienced in a buffet restaurant. With regards to the a la carte Moroccan restaurant we had noted prior to our holiday that previous Trip Advisor reviews had not been particularly good.

Some nights there was fresh steak being grilled as well as other things. We ate in the Moroccan restaurant on our last night and it was brilliant. Staff were very nice in the Moroccan restaurant.

The waiting staff were on hand to get you drinks if you hadn't got your own from the drink station and they were quick to remove your empty plates. While we enjoyed our drinks in the lobby bar of an evening Imad the manager always took the time to ask guests how their day had been and he remembered most guest's name's which was a nice touch.

Food was slightly better this time, fresh fish being grilled outside was a nice addition to the buffet. Nice to se the frogs are still there 😀. The zen pool has gone downhill, there are 3 pools on site... a children's pool, a large pool with music and aqua sports, aqua aerobics etc, and the zen pool, the zen pool is meant to be tranquil and quiet (zen like) unfortunately there was some young Americans there so lots of ""like this"" and ""like that"" in that 'Saved By The Bell' & High School Musical drivel, also some English ladies who twittered on. Luckily the lifeguard walks around telling people to be quiet, I like that! Lovely place…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

I had contacted the hotel prior to our arrival to arrange some flowers for my wife, she was suitably impressed with the lovely bouquet of 24 red roses ❤️. The choice of food was superb, the special highlight being the Moroccan food which was unlike anything we had tried back in the UK. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and well maintained by a dedicated team of gardeners. The Zen pool which we used was a spot of tranquility, very peaceful if you want to chill out with a book or two!

First night we arrived late after a flight delay and were able to go and get some food from the restaurant first and then were shown to our rooms which are spotless as is whole hotel with beautiful gardens. The staff really can’t do enough for you and nothing is too much trouble. There aren’t any tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms but when the manager, Iman came around asking how we were finding our stay my friend asked him could we have a kettle.

The hotel is very well run with management very visible and available at all hours of the day and night. When we were there the Iberostar owners were on a visit and all staff were nervous and on edge - I don't know why... as a guest I can't imagine that hotel got anything other than a glowing review. This is an older hotel given a facelift in recent years and rebranded as an Iberostar Hotel.

The staff are amazing. From the super-enthusiastic entertainment team to the dining room staff, pool staff, cleaners, kitchen & bar staff & everyone else that makes this vast hotel tick along so smoothly. Without exception staff were smiley, kind, helpful, friendly and fun. They work very hard and are super efficient in their tasks.

 May 2018,5,Wow!!! Just wow!!!!,"First of all, the reviews on here do not do the hotel, nor that staff justice. Myself, my husband and 12 year old son have just returned from a weeks half term break here and we were very upset to leave. We have visited Egypt on a number of occasions and the standards have been so high we have always struggled to find any where that compares, that was until now. Where to start? Staff: From the cleaners, the grounds men, the waiting staff, animation team, reception, bar staff to management, everyone took time to speak and get to know you. Everyone was so polite and could not do enough for you. The bar men got to know us pretty well and soon as we sat down at the terrace bar, our drinks were there.

The staff are a credit to the hotel, they never stop sweeping, wiping and tidying. The gardens are very well maintained and watered and look and smell great. Our room had 4 single beds and was basic but again clean and had all we needed. The hairdryer was one of the better ones I’ve had in a hotel abroad too. The balcony’s are small, they barely fit a table and chairs, but to be honest this wasn’t an issue for us. The food was tasty, varied and well presented. We didn’t try the Moroccan restaurant and stuck to the main one due to the kids. The outside seating is lovely and again everything is spotless.

Staff were friendly and not pushy at all if you didn't want to get too involved. Food was plentiful for all meals with various options to keep most people happy. This hotel was exactly what we needed and we left feeling very relaxed.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The food is plentiful and lots of choice including Moroccan dishes, salad, pizza/pasta and meats and lots of different deserts including fresh crepes and fruit. Only slight gripe is that it's not particularly hot which may not be an issue for most people but we like it hot. Soft drinks are branded and on tap for you to get as many as you like as is wine and beer. Please be aware English isn't an overall commonly spoken language here, the reception staff, managers and entertainment staff all speak good English but other members of staff not so well, the entertainment is mostly in French.

The food was great with lots of choice each day at all meal times. For breakfast there were lots of pastries, cereals, meats, cheese, eggs, bacon and sausages (not the english type).

Kids enjoyed the splash pool never got bored. The bigger pool although we used it we had a 6 month old water was just too cold for him to use it.

 May 2018,4,Good value for money,"The hotel was in a lovely manicured garden setting, with 3 pools; one for adults with the Zen bar nearby, one larger main pool, and one for children. We opted for the adult pool, where there were always plenty of sunbeds (we went in late May), so no need to get up extra early! We found tipping the staff made them much more attentive, such as the barman around the pool, bringing us drinks instead of having to queue up at the bar. Our twin room was always cleaned daily to a very good standard, and the beds were a good single size and comfortable. Although one morning, whilst we were sleeping, the maid came in and took all our towels, so be sure to put the 'do not disturb' sign out!

 May 2018,4,Mixed review but mostly good!,"Visited this hotel with my husband during the last week of May. After a horrendous experience in Marrakech airport customs control, we were delighted to be able to have early check in into our room. On first impression, the hotel reception is impressive and the reception staff are friendly. After getting information about the hotel, we went to our room. We had booked a double but got two twin beds pushed together. I’ve come across this before but usually the bedding is made up as a double bed - our beds were made up as individual but pushed together. We also booked a pool view room but we could only see a sliver of it due to the view being obscured by a tree by the restaurant.

We arrived quite late (after our transfer driver got lost but that's for another review which has nothing to do with Iberostar Club Palmeraie). We made it to the dining room ten mins before they closed but we were told they would have done us a cold plate anyway. We got a garden view room which was just gorgeous. We awoke on our first morning to the most amazing birdsong which I never tired of. The food is indescribable. Its just fabulous.

We spent most our time at the zen pool as we wanted to chill for the most part. This was a beautiful area with a bar on hand, bar man was lovely and very friendly.

I hadn’t finished my drink and they had already put a fresh one down.. Mohamed being the best one, fetching us olives, nuts, breads and cheeses. Excellent service. To be honest, the staff make that place what it is! Room was spacious and clean, fresh towels every day, cleaner even tidied our clothes etc, again a superb service.

Positives - Super friendly staff Very decent rooms Great facilities that are value for money Decent buffet and bar facilities Very Nice garden and sports facilities Negatives- Pool should be heated in May , I certainly couldn’t use pool much as it was freezing which was very disappointing . Having a heated pool will make this place very attractive to come again - the Moroccan restaurant was bit disappointing, in fact the food in main restaurant buffet was much better . I feel it maybe good to have a different cousine restaurant to give another option . All in all had a good time",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Gorgeous friendly and welcoming,Great place - just arrived but blown away by hospitality! Lots to do and food is awesome. Zen pool great - travelling with three teens and they are all happy ! Can’t fault that ! We tried the table tennis and badminton so far and - although equipment has seen better days - can’t complain - it’s all free ! Regular bus to souq - is OK - but it takes 20 mins walk to actually reach the old town - definitely worth the effort though- the place is fabulous!,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Amazed,"Just back from a week at this great hotel. The food is fabulous, buffet style, lots of choice, local and European for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The fresh salads are great. The staff are wonderful. Very attentive and caring. The Management are 100% hands on too. Rooms spacious and clean, great views. The only negative is no kettle, which means a long wait between bedtime and breakfast. The gardens are gorgeous and very well kept, as are the pools.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2018,5,Beautiful gardens and lovely staff,We have just returned from this great hotel. The food and staff are excellent and we loved the huge gardens with a variety of sporting activities available. This hotel is so much better than many of the four star European hotels we’ve stayed in.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 May 2018,3,It was ok!!,At first we were pleased with the hotel. There are six of us to adults for children and we have two rooms which were clean and well presented. As stated in other reviews the pools are quite cold but refreshing. Language barrier can be difficult with some of the staff but the ones do you understand English very helpful and pleasant . Real disappointments. After two days of being at the hotel at the children’s pool we Began to get the feeling if you had children we were classed as a lower class guests. We were not allowed to have the comfortable Sun loungers but we have been using them for the previous two days until the lifeguards decided that they need to be removed all of them from the children’s pool. I didn’t find this acceptable and went and found the hotel manager…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 May 2018,5,Lovely hotel with amazing staff,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from an amazing week at the Iberostar. The food was great a couple of nights were average but some nights were just amazing with seafood such as lobster, prawns and oysters. They also had sirloin steak, a sushi night and amazing freshly made pizza for lunch and dinner. Also the deserts were amazing - mousses, gooey meringues and macaroons. On our last night (Monday) they had cocktails and canapés by the pool and even some fizz! Was a great end to the week. The drinks were good - they had proper coffee at the main bar (thanks to the barman who always put lovely designs on my cappuccino). The cocktails that they had were great - mojitos and piña coladas - however the selection was limited the 'daiquiris' weren't very daiquiri like. The tap…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 April 2018,5,"Brilliant time, sad to be home","I visited this hotel with a friend for 4 nights and we stayed in a pool room view. The hotel is really lovely and very well kept, the gardens are beautifully maintained and there are always people out tending to them. The pool areas are lovely, the main pool was a little chilly due to the time of year, but we still got in as did lots of others. There is a smaller heated pool but we chose not to sit around that one as it was a bit more crowded. The kids pool looked amazing, although we obviously didn't use it. There is a really nice play area and water slides too, so if you're coming with children, they wont be disappointed. It's also really worth mentioning that there are no fights for sunbeds, at all!!! Not even if you go out mid morning! We had mixed weather with a bit of…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2018,4,Great hotel at a fabulous price,"This is our 3rd experience of staying in an Iberostar property and again, we were very impressed. The rooms were nice with a small balcony and large bathroom. We didn’t have a bath in our room, just a rain shower which was extremely powerful. The bed was pretty comfortable too. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful with manicured flower beds full of colour. You have the main pool which is large but not heated so it wasn’t busy. The snack wagon is located here. The food being served was fine if you wanted something quick. The smaller heated pool which is still fairly big was much busier but never a problem getting sun loungers. There is a bar close by too managed by a woman who doesn’t smile very much! The main restaurant is large and we were always looked after by a lovely…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 April 2018,4,Great Family option,"Had a 5 day break with partner and 3 children 18, 14 and 11 over Easter bank holiday. Rooms were simple and clean, no in-room coffee/tea making facilities etc. Service was exemplary. Saleh was great on the pool bar and there was a lovely man working in the restaurant whose name I've now forgotten. Food was of good quality and something for everyone. All inclusive was a great option and value for money with cocktail drinking Teenager, and younger ones constantly looking for a juice/soda etc. The wine was very drinkable also!. The waffle/hotdog van was a hit. Trapeze was great. Never a shortage of beds even over Easter Weekend. Pool was heated enough for me to get in and I can take some persuading.

 April 2018,4,Perfect place to stay,"Second time we visited this beautiful place. The gardens are so nice and well kept. Most of the guests are French and since Kappa club is present with some entertainers I have the feeling they are forgetting a bit about their other guests. Nobody met us at the reception and cared in a way some people write about. You feel a bit anonymous when you are not part of the big groups and families that are visiting the hotel. For us its's okay we do not have the need to be amused but a little more attention (especially for returning guests could and would be nice). Nevertheless we will return, because a lot of things at this hotel are very nice. Restaurant, bar, rooms, everyone is taking good care of you.

 February 2018,5,Fab Hotel,From the moment I arrived I felt the staff really cared. I’d booked a quick solo break last minute & emailed the hotel asking for a ground floor room near reception due to walking issues. My room was perfect very close to the lobby with a fab view of the gardens. The room was cleaned well daily the only issue I had was the cleaner accidentally throw away my travel face cleanser but the head of housekeeping couldn’t have been more apologetic. The weather was kind very cold & quite wet even for Marrakech apparently meaning most of the guests were inside the hotel during the day. The animation team were there arranging things to do I was never bored. I got to know the bar staff who were lovely & kept me supplied with olives yum!! Always happy & nothing was too much trouble.

 April 2018,5,So glad we chose this hotel,"We are so glad we chose to stay outside the medina, so we had the chance to really relax and get away from everything. The location was stunning - and a free shuttle bus into the city meant that we could pop into the city centre when we liked - so we had the best of both worlds. The hotel was spotlessly clean - possibly one of the cleanest hotels I’ve stayed at. The food was very tasty, fresh, well cooked and a huge variety to suit all tastes. We ate something different almost every day. The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and attentive - every single person made us feel very well looked after. There were plenty of things to do (or not do - if you just wanted to relax). The rooms were large enough, bright, airy and clean. Can’t think of a single bad thing to say…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The hotel was faultless and all the staff from reception, to the bar and from the maids to the restaurant were superb. The weather being not that great didn't matter.

 April 2018,4,Lovely hotel with lovely staff,"Had a delightful short break at the Palmeraie. The hotel has extensive grounds, which are utilised well. The hotel is welcoming and the staff are in the main exceptional. There is a main dining area and one additional Moroccan themed restaurant, which in my opinion limits your food choices. The range of food offered in the main dining area is good and of good quality but the vegetarian options were limited. Although, the chef is very happy to provide an alternative if requested. There was a large Asian family when we stayed and it appeared that their meals were specifically catered for. The few days we were there did become repetitive for food choices. There was one themed Moroccan night and I would suggest they offer at least two more themed nights each week to vary the dining…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

There was lots of our children to do, my younger son adored the Star Friends girls! They made lots of friends and we all felt very welcome, relaxed and very safe. I noticed how the animation team would take special care of anyone who seemed on their own and would sit and eat with them. Karima , the excursion lady in the entrance hall, sorted us out with some fabulous trips out, camel riding and a private mountain tour which were highlights of our stay.

There are plenty of sporting activities to do during the day and the staff that ran them were really helpful. We really enjoyed archery and then did tennis and table tennis. When it was warm we sunbathed around the main pool because the adults only pool was full of children because it was heated and no one stopped the children from going there. There was plenty of food to choose from at each meal but the staff were unable to keep up with the change over of tables so when we went in at 9 for our evening meal there was rarely a table set and we would have to wait.

It's very good value, spotlessly clean and the staff are very friendly, clearly work very hard and are very efficient. (We had a problem with the flush on our loo when we returned to our room quite late in the evening. Having notified reception, a plumber turned up within 5 minutes and he replaced the flush and made good within 15 minutes - very impressive). It also felt very very safe, with lots of security.

On arrival it was very welcoming and a beautiful hotel - especially for the deal we got. The room was very clean and well kept. However, no kettles and irons provided in the room. A little walk to the van, bar or restaurant and all your needs would be met with a smile. Ironing service is provided at a fee - not a deal breaker but just be prepared for this maybe? Also a towel deposit is required but refunded at end of stay. The money refunded we just spent at the Medina market, about half an hour from the hotel which the hotel provide a complementary bus service throughout the day.

Where to start, we arrived off the later BA flight and didn’t get to the hotel until around 22.30, the gates to the hotel were locked and we had to be let it by the security guard, he wouldn’t however let our minibus in and so we had to grab the kids, our luggage and walk up the drive, granted it’s not far but wasn’t what we were expecting. Unfortunately it didn’t get much better at check-in, I had booked directly on the Iberostar website which I don’t think happens very often so the check-in staff constantly asked me for my ‘voucher’ when I said I don’t have a voucher this seemed to massively confuse them.

My only recommendation would be to have more of a variety for desserts.

 March 2018,4,Very impressive hotel,"We had a lovely 4 days in Marrakech, and wished we were staying longer. This hotel is a great base for a combination of luxury/relaxing in a hotel, and visiting Marrakech town - we used the shuttle bus daily (spot on time - don't be late!!) and it dropped you conveniently half way between the old and new town so perfect for exploring both - about 15 mins walk either way. It was then lovely to get back from the hustle and bustle to enjoy a welcoming beer/wine whilst relaxing by the amazing pool. The staff here are brilliant, and everyone is so happy and welcoming. (and I don't have a clue what other travellers wrote about French guests being preferred - we were treated the same as everyone else, in a lovely welcoming manner) The food is good for an All Inclusive, and plenty of…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2018,5,Best Hotel in Marrakech!,"Visited for a family holiday in March for 4 nights...wish it was longer! Such a beautiful hotel with great facilities and fantastic food. The staff at this hotel are amazing and hard working, they are always smiling and really enjoy being there. Very clean and beautiful location, lovely gardens and pool area. Great for kids and adults. Good varied choice of food and drinks with it being all inclusive. 25 minutes from the airport. Quad biking and camel rides across the road. Nice bar area and nightclub and Moroccan restaurant. Lots of different areas to relax. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Marrakech and would definitely stay here again!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2018,4,Very nice but,"We went for a few days winter sun and ended up having a city break as the sun was missing for the first few days. Having read reviews we chose iberostar even though we always go 5 star. The hotel was lovely, but you only get one chance to make a first impression. We went to our room to await our luggage and immediately noticed twin beds. We called reception and asked to be moved to a room with a double bed only to be told they had no double beds, but would ask housekeeping to remake the bed as one. While waiting I noticed my jacket that I had put down was covered in dust. The furniture was covered in builders dust, I started looking further and found long hairs on the floor, and then other bits of dirt became apparent, the pubic hair on the bathroom floor was the last straw. I…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2018,4,Good hotel,"We are halfway through our holiday in Marrakech. Here is some pros and cons: Pros: - beautiful, clean and well maintained hotel - room good size, tile flooring which is huge plus - staff seem to enjoy their work, they seem happy and creates good atmosphere. - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks, but it’s not far and easy to find) Cons: - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room, piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 March 2018,4,Wonderful stay at Iberostar Marrakech,"Just returned from a great week's stay as a couple at this hotel, our first trip to Morroco. Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet, looking out onto gardens and very clean. The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception. The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis, boules, tennis, football, volleyball, spinning ,Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into. The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,3,A family stay - positives and negatives,"We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Iberostar Marrakesh, after spending a week touring thorough Morocco and staying in smaller Riads. Pros: we arrived a bit early, just before lunch finished and they welcomed us to go have lunch. The buffet varied every day. One heated pool. Trapeze experience for the kids. Kids love playing Ping Pong. The transportation via shuttle to the center was timely and nice. The rooms were modern and clean. Cons: I agree with other guests that the French speakers seemed more attended to. There was quite a long wait at reception to check in. There were guests - both children and their parents who were accosting the geese - chasing them and throwing things at them - mother geese who wanted to protect their nests and their eggs. …",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2018,4,"Great stay, lovely staff and surroundings","I went with my friend, spent 4 nights. All inclusive. Greeted well by the staff, although I did find that one particular staff member hovered around for a tip when they took our bags to the room. Generally everyone was very hospitable. The food was varied and good - although I doubt it was authentic morrocan food at the buffet. The restaurant manager kindly managed to get us a table last minute, the food was good - although I felt it was very similar ingredients and drinks to what is served in the buffet and the poor serves seem overwhelmed. The shuttle to town was very useful, although we found out about this 2 days into our visit after over paying for taxis. It's a shame the shuttles doesn't operate later into the evening. The rooms were clean and nicely prepared every time we…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2018,4,Pleasent family stay at the Iberostar,"I was in a party of five adults and this was our first visit to Marrakech. Weather at the end of Feb was warm in the day but I wish I had taken a coat for the evenings as it was a little chilly outside. The hotel was further out than I would usually stay but it made for an interesting trip when you left the hotel. We used the free hotel shuttle to the Souks and this arrived and left on time. Although we did not book with Thomas Cook, we were able to book a very enjoyable and reasonable priced trip to the Atlas mountains, with the helpful Thomas Cook lady who sits in the reception area and she speaks English. The hotel staff do an excellent job at keeping the hotel clean throughout. Rooms were ample size with small balcony/terrace with drying rack provided and free safe. …",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2018,4,Good vacation with some issues.,"We stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech for 8 nights in February 2018. I'll start by saying we definitely had a pleasant, relaxing stay, and I would certainly recommend the hotel. That said, there were some issues that could have take the stay from good to great. Pros: The price was very reasonable given the amenities. The buffet was excellent - unlike other all-inclusives I've stayed at, the food was not lots of fried, unhealthy options. There was a substantial salad bar, many vegetable dishes, and the overall predominance of Moroccan food was a nice treat. The various pools had plenty of seating, as did the bar area. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet - some of my companions thought the beds were a bit overly firm, but I thought they were great. …",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2018,5,"Wonderful, attentive service. Beautiful surroundings. Great value.","We have just spent a lovely break away with friends at this hotel. We were a party of 8 - 3 couples and 2 toddlers. It was the first time I've been on an 'all inclusive' holiday, and I wasn't sure of what to expect. The hotel is situated about 15 - 20 mins drive away from the centre of Marrakech in the Palmery area to the east of the city. It therefore is away from the bustle of such a lively city, and is a very different option from one of the classic city centre Riads through which Marrakech gets such a wonderful reputation. It is part of an international chain, and as such benefits from many of the facilities familiar to other hotels in this chain, but this also means the place is not completely individual, and thus the character of the place suffers ever so slightly.

Also would be useful to have an information book in the room, some things you find out as you go eg towel hire etc Location is out of town, but the shuttle bus works really well - and to be honest for a relaxing break, it is probably a plus that you are not in central Marrakech",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Temperatures were around 21 degrees during the day and cooler in both the mornings and evenings - suggest you layer up. Very friendly entertainment team, keep the clientele engaged, massive thank you to Mido who made the kids holidays. Lots to keep you active from stretching, water aerobics, tennis, archery and spin. Nice gym too. Not over crowded, always had a sunbed, heated pool was lovely - didnt see anyone in the normal pool during our 5 day stay (probably because the weather was not hot enough). There is a deposit of 100 dh (pp) for the towels which is refunded at the end of the stay. Food was excellent and plentiful, caters well for…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 February 2018,2,So Many Problems,"I stayed here for a week and had a terrible stay. My room door did not lock but did shut. We were asked to move rooms after 1 night as our room was not ready when we arrived. The shuttle bus does not stop at the market although they told us it did. Next time we will get a taxi. Very annoying. The wifi is terrible either in the rooms or in the hotel. Its basically 5% coverage at best. Just does not work. The cleaner would tidy the room at 4pm each day, so late. Extras such as washing and telephone calls so expensive. The bed sheet had stains. At breakfast food often run out at one point there was no bread, lemon and milk. We waited ages for it to arrive. Im shocked there are so many good reviews on this hotel we were very disappointed.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

It's spotless inside and out. The rooms are generous and tended 3 times day. The staff are incredibly friendly and can't do enough for you. The food and drink are bountiful and there is something for even the most challenging of eaters! My husband and I went with another couple and were totally spoiled. While there it was our friend's 40th and they made her a cake, sung to her in 3 languages and gave her a bottle of bubbly! The rooms were dressed everyday, beds turned down at night, chocolates, petals, the works. Amazing. I would recommend it to anyone and would definitely go back in a heartbeat.

The staff are excellent and my children enjoyed all the activities including the trapeze, badminton, tennis, boules, and archery were daily favourties. Even the little ones can have a go as its very safe and lots of fun. The food is good and they have a sushi evening which went down well. They also have a Moroccon restaurant you can book in advance and is a nice change from the buffet. When we were unpacking we realised we hadn't any asthma pumps for my son. Panic!

The lady on reception was a really lovely host. We found the food to be good, a variety at all mealtimes and usually well labelled. All alcohol was pleasant and cocktail choice was good. The bar and restaurant staff were smiling and welcoming. There is always something for even fussy plain eaters. The pools are a great set up with an adults only as well as a general pool and a separate large kids pool. There are many activities here to keep you and / kids occupied, even trapeze lessons! All the main areas…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2017,4,EXCELLENT ALL INCLSIVE HOTEL,"The one factor that stands above anything in summing up this hotel is the staff. I have never come across staff anywhere else who are so dedicated, friendly and helpful. With the exception of one or two individuals I've never met such a smiley bunch. They are extremely hard working and are a credit to the hotel. Overall, the hotel is spotlessly clean and the grounds are very pretty and well kept. The rooms are basic but spacious and perfectly adequate although I did find the beds extremely firm, bordering on rock hard! The bathrooms have a shower - no bathtub. The food is good and caters for all tastes and appetites. All inclusive drinks are ok but one or two of the bar staff need encouragement to serve alcohol! Entertainment - they try very hard. We had a super stay and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,3,For families only and not for this time of the year,"We just came home from this trip. In general this hotel is good and the management as well as all the staff is very friendly and nice (as long as you dont come early for breakfast). BUT: This hotel is focused on Familie guests with Kids which means if you are just a couple and want to have a quiet space to relax or a quiet table at the dining room for a nice dinner (like we expected at the occcasion of a birthday) you have no chance at all. The Dining room is noisy ad crowded like a railway station. BUT: They have no heaters in dining room, bar and lobby. As the outside temperatur in the morning was 4 degrees and we had to eat with our winter coats on. Also we cought a heavy cold including fever and have to stay in bed now.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Outstanding hotel with exceptional staff,My husband and myself stayed here from 25th November for 14 nights. From arrival to departure we could not fault anything about this beautiful hotel. Upon our arrival reception staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming and we were checked in very efficiently and although our room wasn't ready (we arrived before normal check in time) we were shown through to the restaurant for lunch and we were greeted by the lovely Youseff who made us feel instantly welcome and from that minute we knew we were going to enjoy our stay at the hotel. After lunch we went to our room and were delighted with its location. Food was excellent and always a wide variety to choose from at all meal times and the deserts were delicious too! The service provided by all staff was exceptional at all…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,The perfect Christmas break from cold London,"I must say thank you for such a wonderful stay.  All of the staff and management made such a difference to our holiday in their own unique way, from running around relentlessly trying to find a lost phone, to picking up medicine from the pharmacy on their way to work, to spending time getting to know my family and forever making sure we are having the best time possible. Never have I stayed anywhere where all the staff are so caring and cooperative. Management clearly share an ethos which is; to go above and beyond - and this ethos filters right down to the frontline staff. The food is great and so carefully presented. In 9 days I believe the longest I queued for anything was 2 minutes. They do a good job at keeping on top of things so everything runs so seamlessly. Thank you…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Not to be missed! Would definitely go back!,"We stayed at Iberostar Palmeraie Marrakech for 9 nights. We had three rooms, which were all in a row, two of them being interconnected, which made the stay even more comfortable. The staff did their upmost to meet our requirement, and they even upgraded our three rooms :). The atmosphere was calm and we rarely experienced any noise from outside our rooms. The garden view was very nice and gave us a refreshing and ideal experience. This hotel is very safe and secure. This hotel is ideal for every kind of break and stay, as it offers a wide range of activities for active kids and adults and also has an ideal environment for relaxation. It has a lovely garden and in addition a large green area with beautifully maintained plants and trees, including lemon-, orange and olive trees…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Great Trip,"Stayed here for just under a week. Overall a great time. Staff was friendly and accommodating, rooms were always clean, wide selection of food at every meal. The shuttle was on time to the city and pleasant to use. The only critique was that the wifi in out room was spotty. Overall, great value, glad we chose this place.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Anniversary Winter Break,"My partner and I had a lovely anniversary here, the staff always went above and beyond for us, and the atmosphere was lovely. They even brought us a cake on our anniversary, and we had lovely towel displays left on our beds every night. We would definitely return in the summer, and make more use of amenities, such as the huge pools but it was abit cold this time of year to be expected! We would like to thank the hotel greatly for a lovely trip, and a special thanks to Momo, Amine, and the team :)",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Relaxing Weekend Break,We arrived on Friday afternoon and were greeted by the very attentive friendly reception team who made our check in quick and hassle free. Just what's needed after an early morning start. Our room was spotless and very well kept during our stay with daily maid service. Throughout our stay the whole hotel team made our experience a really pleasant and memorable one. A special mention to Imran the manager who greeted us the first day to introduce himself and take the time to chat although very busy and throughout our stay always asked if we were ok and had everything we needed whenever he passed us. There is a wide variety of all inclusive drinks available and always at mealtimes something new to try. Delicious!! Not one single bad point can be said about this hotel and we will…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Clean and Friendly,"This hotel is absolutely immaculate. Everywhere we looked there seemed to be somebody cleaning something and there was always a delicate smell of incense in the main hotel areas. We received a very friendly welcome, and after lunch we were shown to our room which was spotless and well prepared with a poolside view. The grounds are extensive and again immaculate with at least six gardeners working at any given time. Several hotel cats and geese freely roam the grounds. The entertainments team are always on the go, gently encouraging guests to join in the activities but they are now way pushy or too 'in your face'. Even when it was raining, they adapted the days program to suit the weather. Mehdi in particular has boundless energy. He remembers everybody's name and always stops…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Perfect Break!!,"Stayed here first week in December for 4 nights with my husband and we both loved it, just wished it was for longer. The room was lovely and clean and overlooked the front garden with. The view from the balcony was amazing. We loved going for walks in the lovely garden area and relaxing by the pool listening to music in the background. The main reception area smelled beautiful, there were always activities going on and we loved the themed entertainment every night. The entertainment team were true professionals and very talented. During the day the staff were all cheerful, friendly and always stopped to say hello or chat. Special thanks to Khalil and Laila who joined us for lunch a few times and told us their stories and listened to ours. Also thanks to the other 2…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 December 2017,5,"Last minute relaxing week away. Cats, geese, and beautiful gardens, even fun when it rained!","I booked this holiday as a last minute relaxing getaway before Christmas and couldn't have been happier with the hotel. The room (garden view) was immaculately kept and I found it very comfortable. The bed was huge and comfortable, the bathroom large and well stocked, no bath but may be available in other rooms but large walk in shower. There was plenty of space to relax in the room if you wish with a sofa, desk, and chairs and table on a small patio/balcony with a view of the beautifully kept green gardens. Facilities included a large pool, smaller 'zen' pool, splash pool for the kids, extensive gardens with their own flock of geese, and plenty of outdoor seating areas. Plenty of activities on offer including boules, exercise area, darts, and even a trapeze! There were shows…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,A wonderful break at Club Palmeraie All Inclusive Hotel Marrakech,"I spent 5 nights at the hotel with my daughter and loved everything about it. The staff were so kind and attentive and all took time to learn our name providing a very personal touch. As we approached the bar for a tea each afternoon the bar staff welcomed us and already knew our favourite tea, and that we were a bit quirky and liked it in a big glass! The food in the buffet was excellent and the choices were so varied that no one would struggle to find a meal they enjoyed. The Moroccan choices were so tasty but we also made our own pasta dishes on some evenings, selecting what we wanted included and its cooked fresh. There was always a fish dish and pizza option as well. Wonderful salads and a carved meat option! All our drinks etc were included so I think it was…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Excellent value and (when we visited) no kids!!!,"This is a great place just outside the city (about 20 mins) that has everything you need except, as we found all over Morocco, you don't get kettles/coffee/ tea in your rooms. The staff are excellent and very friendly and the food lovely with a huge selection. I also recommend the seperate Moroccan restaurant. The local beer is very nice and I suggest Casablanca as the best brand plus the local wines are very nice. The rooms are large and very comfortable and are kept spotlessly clean along with the whole site. There are a selection of sports to partake in like Boules or Archery and, what surprised me, there is a full size trapeze set up like in a circus. Have fun!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 December 2017,5,Possibly the best hotel in the world,"Its difficult to describe how amazing this hotel is. you walk around the grounds you see fresh lime trees growing and olives on the trees. the entertainment teams are fantastic and make sure everyone joins in from all over the world, they are a fantastic team. you have Amine, a mischeivious little one always playing nice little tricks to keep you smiling and on your toes. you have a Kali a great young man who is always smiling and always looks out for you. Mo Mo always on hand to help you with your stay. youssef an inspirational young man who even through bouts of tooth ache was coming into work and looking after myself and my girlfriend youssef is an amazing person who we both have grown close too. the food here is amazing and always changes, the desserts are the best i have…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,4,Best Time,"I visited this hotel with my friends for a birthday vacation. The hotel was able to provide us with all that we needed to the best of their ability. We had such a good time and enjoyed ourselves. The team/people who worked their were all amazing and treated us well. The staff included Salah, Flores and many others, just want to say a big thank you to all of them that made our trip great. The only thing that would need a look into would be the variation in the food menu. Other than that, everything was great. Would definitely go back! 💛",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2017,4,Holiday 2027,"Loved this hotel, staff were great really friendly and helpful. Beautiful pools and grounds kept immaculate.

 November 2017,4,Visited end of Nov to beg Dec,"This was our second visit to Marrakech, but this time we wanted a little bit more luxury and away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The Iberostar club palmeraie was perfect. Not too far away for the main centre (20 mins) (30 mins to Airport) and the hotel provided a free shuttle bus to the centre and has good times during the day where you can be dropped off and picked up. And not too far from the atlas mountains if you are planning to book an excursion to it. Best to book any excursion through Karima who is a tour operator based in the hotel and is there daily from 9-11:30, (she is part of thomas cook but anyone can book excursions not just thomas cook customers) Karima is excellent and our tour to the mountains which included a lunch was superb! The tour guide kamal…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Great hotel!! 100% recommend!!,"After a shocking visit to another hotel, arriving at the Iberostar was like a breath of fresh air! We were welcomed personally by the duty manager and other members of staff, and our check-in process was quick and seamless. In hind-site I would recommend that reception discuss the process on how to obtain pool towels. You have to put down the deposit at reception in order to get a card which you then take to the sports building (by the Zen pool) where the card then gets swapped out for towels. This is only minor but would make getting your holiday started a little quicker. The room was incredibly clean with comfy beds, plenty of storage and a sweet balcony. The air con worked well (especially with the heating option which we did need in the evenings as it did get quite chilly…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,"Incredible value for money and happy, well looked after staff","The hotel is about 30 mins from town by taxi and is in a secluded and peaceful part of Marrakech. The hotel has all the facilities you might need, with excellent food and drink included. The rooms were comfortable, though we could have done with a better view, but didn't complain due to the low price paid. The outstanding feature of this hotel, however, is its staff. Every member of staff is friendly and happy to help. What I liked the most was that you saw the staff eating with guests in the restaurant, so on the surface of things they seem to be well looked after. Well done Iberostar! Cannot recommend highly enough, I hope to be back.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,4,Holiday,This is a really good hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful and really can’t do enough for you. There is a very good variety of food on offer and we found the wine offered in the all inclusive package was perfectly acceptable. Our room was clean and spacious and very well kept by our lovely housekeeper. We had a problem with the key card not activating the electricity which was sorted very quickly. The gin and tonics in the bar varied in strength depending on who was serving them and the entertainment team worked really hard to keep everyone occupied. Things that needed improvement are as follows: The toaster available at breakfast was truly awful. It might sound minor but having to queue for ages to be able to make toast was not funny. I eat gluten free bread and it…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,4,Fantastic winter get away,"The staff really do make this hotel, without them it would not have been the great stay it was. They were amazing with our three year old daughter and they really made her feel welcome and made such an effort with her. She loved the dancers - she thinks they were Princesses and is their number one fan haha! The entertainment staff were fantastic and were somehow still cheerful and helpful even after what seemed to be long working days. They always seemed to be working from early until late! The bar and restaurant staff were lovely an they all gave fantastic service. Even the cleaning staff were great. One even came and cheered my daughter up when she was upset. The rooms were clean and good sized. Although they were quite noisy, on one night we were kept awake by loud music and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,4,Good hotel for a short stay,"Firstly the room was lovely, quiet (apart from some other guests whose coming and going was a little loud - no fault of the hotel), spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The food and restaurant service was good with a great choice. The bar service was generally ok, a little slow on occasions when only one or two members of staff serving. Bar staff generally professional but maybe not as friendly as other areas. We didn't tend to drink the alcohol much (not large drinkers in any case so not really a problem). The cocktails were very sweet and not exciting. The wine was drinkable with a little dilution. Entertainment staff friendly and definitely tried to involve guests. The venue and timings for the entertainment was a little hit and miss whilst we were there. We really…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,5,Brilliant!! Stay here!,"After a horrific stay at Eden Andalou and a terrible start to our holiday we decided to switch hotels, and it was the best thing we did. From the moment we arrived at the Iberostar the whole experience was excellent, we were greeted by the general manager instantly, served a welcome drink and welcomed by the guest relations manager and other members of staff. First impressions were great. However I would like to stress that these experiences from all members of staff continued for the duration of our trip. To sum it up: Lovely hotel Clean rooms Great choice at the all inclusive buffet Super staff Excellent facilities Love the food cart and recommend the strawberry pancakes Iberostar turned what started as an awful holiday into a great holiday.

 November 2017,5,Outstanding All Inclusive Hotel,"I have just returned to the UK from a 4 nights all inclusive deal at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech. Let me start by saying how much I loved this hotel. It is clean. The rooms are excellent. The restaurant / canteen which is a self-serve for breakfast, lunch and dinner offers a great variety of choices at every meal time and drinks galore to accompany them. What sets this hotel apart from a lot of hotels I have stayed in at various locations around the world is the staff. They are wonderful. Entertainment is laid on during the day and evenings by a motivated, engaged and friendly team who go out of their way to make you feel welcome. You can go spinning at 10am in the morning if you want to (I did). There are darts competitions, Many people relaxed and played petanque.…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Having stayed in everything from bamboo shacks in Asia to 5 star hotels in Europe, Australia and America; Club iberostar staff are the best, they are there when you need them, always doing everything to make you feel relaxed, welcome, and at home. Many hotel make have great service but make you feel like you don't have space to breath, Club Iberostar has hundreds of staff yet you don't feel surrounded and like you can't even wipe your bum without someone sticking their head through the window.

 November 2017,4,A great hotel,"Stayed here for a week on an all inclusive basis, The hotel is very clean, the staff are all very friendly and engaging, The food is delicious and plentiful although I would say that they predominantly cater for the French holidaymaker, ( if I see another crepe I might just go mad !) king prawn night was my favourite ! I have to add that the dessert chef needs some serious recognition, they were delicious, little cakes and chocolate mousse to die for .... they really need to make more of that array and not display it down at the back of the restaurant. The Moroccan local cuisine is delicious and very colourful although we didn’t eat in the Moroccan restaurant onsite. Considering it’s all inclusive the alcohol selection could do with a few additions, it really is a very…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,4,Nice resort and worth every penny,"A group of three of us (Americans) - two forty year olds and a 13 year old - stay here for three nights at Thanksgiving. We’ve stayed at all-inclusives before in the Caribbean (including an Iberostar) and this in no way compares to that. But, for a little over $35 a day per person, this place can’t be beat for the value. The rooms were very nicely appointed and clean, and the beds were comfortable. Food was (in typical Iberostar fashion) excellent. Drinks were hit and miss. Service was ok. Pools were nice, but not heated and a bit too chilly to enjoy in late November. Lots of activities and sports. Only real downsides were the distance from town (a good 25 minutes by car) and poor WiFi. Fortunately there is a shuttle that leaves to and from the resort to the Medina every hour or…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The food was very good, a great choice on offer beautifully presented, and as I am vegetarian there were ample dishes. There are relaxing stunning gardens, pools, a big pond, activities if you wish to partake, great shows - the dancing is amazing.

The rooms are spotless, and the hotel throughout from the bars, dining room and relaxation areas are all very clean. Even the bins around the grounds seem to be emptied every half hour. And, everywhere smells nice! The food is very good, and there's lots of choice. There's a different theme every night at the cooking station near the main dining room door.

We had several chats to Saber who was very entertaining and told us a lot about Morocco. I particularly want to mention the golf pro, Hassan, what a nice guy, and very good at teaching, amazing to be able to get free golf lessons in the sun!

A very small practice place but a lot of fun. We hope Hassan will have his dreamhole in short term so he can make his lessons even more interesting. Hassan you go for it!

Somethings to be aware of - when you get off the bus taxi drivers plague you. I made the mistake thinking they were linked to the hotel and once you start talking to them it's hard to shrug them off. Also be careful visiting the tanneries, a lot of people indicating which is the correct way to go and then following you . The place is like a maze and it was quite unsettling.

Rooms were clean and a decent size, with the only downside being something of a sewer smell from the block on a couple of occasions. Food was good and far better than we expected, although compared to some all-inclusives the variety was a little limited - although my teens were always happy! Sports facilities are BRILLIANT and we played football and tennis every day. Group football was not brilliantly organised but…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 November 2017,4,Beautiful oasis,"A short distance from the airport and away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina, this hotel is a quiet and relaxing oasis in Marrakech. The aesthetics of the hotel are quintessentially Moroccan and are very photogenic. The hotel grounds are spotless and the gardens are stunning. The food is spectacular and some of the best we have had in a hotel. The staff seem to really love working there, are so polite and want you to have an amazing stay. For Halloween, the entire hotel was decorated, the food was themed and the staff all dressed up in costumes. The main issue we experienced was trying to sleep with our one year old, as the music from the entertainment could be heard until late. We were also awoken very early by the call to prayer from the nearby mosque on multiple…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,4,An oasis in the desert,"We were impressed with this hotel from the outset. On arrival we were greeted with friendly faces, undivided attention and good seamless checking in. We had booked less than 48 hours before travelling and had asked for a double room but when we were shown to our room it had 2 single beds. We told this to the man who had taken our bags up and after briefly speaking to reception our bed was changed to a large double. Every member of staff, every day, from the chamber maid to the manager(s) greeted us with a smile and nothing was ever too much trouble. The room was spotlessly clean and the linen and the towels were changed as and when you requested them to be changed, which for me is a plus as so many hotels waste valuable resources washing linen daily when it isn't always…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,INCREDIBLY AMAZING,"We've been staying at the resort on the last week of October. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, all the staff had been very welcoming and especially one of the managers, Imad that has been completely helpful and friendly for all our stay. The resort incredibly clean, well organised and beautiful. Food is very good. Our taxi driver, Tariq that accompanied us to a trip in Essaouira and around the city, has been amazing with us, friendly, very accommodating and honestly, very professional! The journey was very pleasant, fun and with loads of party music in his car that almost seemed to be in a club 😂. Great people, all of them. They made me feel like at home. This resort deserves 5 star!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Better than many 5 star hotels,"The hotel is about a 15 minute drive from Marrakech city and occupies well maintained large ground plot. On arrival the hotel staff greet you - they are all excellent and friendly and sort out any problem or difficulty immediately, in particular the guest relations manager Elkhaoudari Imad. The hotel is well maintained with lovely entrance lobby, rooms etc. An example of solving a problem was the low shower pressure in the room on arrival. I reported this to the lobby desk and it was immediately repaired. The hotel has 3 pools - a very large pool for games and exercises etc, a children's pool with a rather fascinating barrel tipping shower and a 'quiet'' pool with a bar. We spent much of our time at the 'quiet' pool sunbathing (in temperatures of up to 37C, high for October)…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Half term break,"When you read reviews sometimes you think the people's personality might bias their review, all the reviews on here currently are true! This hotel is truly fabulous there isn't a single thing that I could complain about. The service from as soon as you arrive is excellent, the customer service advisor for the hotel memorises everyone's names and makes you feel extra welcome. We were quickly shown to our bedroom, it was our anniversary so we had champagne, cake, fruit, and two robes waiting for us (on the house) The cleanliness of the room and hotel couldn't have been any better! There were no worries of hygiene in the restaurants. I would say that spoons needs to be laid out onto the tables and more seating outside provided, this was half term and the hotel wasn't at full…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Absolutely enjoyed and recommend this hotel, will go back for sure. 🙌",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Fantastic quality friendly hotel,"From start to finish amazing! Service great, good quality drinks, shame they provide water in plastic bottles which from an environmental point of view seemed a shame, would prefer water coolers. Food included lobster and prawns! Huge choice! Rooms clean and fresh and cleaned everyday. We were upgraded when arrived and had champagne given to us for a birthday! Wine and beer of a fair quality considering where you are! Free shuttle bus in and out of Marrakesh which is great, please use it as it's such a shame to not experience Marrakesh! Guest relation manager was fab, knew everyone's name and was on hand every day if you had any queries! Didn't use the entertainment team as we were a couple just relaxing! Great pools.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,4,Solid 4 star hotel,We would normally stay in 5 star hotels when travelling but decided to try here because of the great reviews- therefore we feel we have good experience to compare this with many other hotels across the globe. We should also say that we came here during half term holidays and so it was packed with families! People who had been here the week before told us how much quieter it had been before! Pros: - greeted with cold drink upon arrival - excellent choice of food at mealtime - some freshly cooked as you watch - very clean and well maintained hotel and grounds - helpful and friendly staff - decent entertainment (mainly in French!) - plenty of activities during the day if you want to partake - weather in 30s every day - 3 pools with lots of sun beds Cons: - upon arrival…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,4,Lovely hotel,"The hotel staff are extremely friendly and smiley. The room and hotel was very clean, bed was comfy with nice clean linen. Bathroom and shower were good. Spa treatments were excellent and I would deff recommend the hot stone massage. The food was nice, plenty of choice so you'll find something you like. Drinks were very sweet, I stuck with beer and gin. The on site Moroccan restaurant was disappointing, the food had no flavor.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,I shouldn't be telling you this,"Just back from one of the best hotels that I have stayed at with my wife and 12 year old daughter , no its not the most plush no its not the most outlandish , hasn't got the biggest facade . But what it has got are - Great staff , Great management which work in harmony to make your stay here the best as it can be. Best advise I can give you is take a deep breath you have arrived and enjoy this oasis in the desert , its far enough away from the city centre so theres no hustle and bustle to worry about , city centre is about 15 - 20 minutes away from this resort , hotel has its own shuttle if you wish to go into marrakech . For a week away its just what the soul needs , there is not a single thing that I can say I didn't like . The rooms are lovely and modern ,flat screen TV…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Wonderful family holiday - perfect in every way!,"We stayed for 6 nights during October half term with our children ages 10 and 11. We were given a lovely welcome when we arrived by Imad and were shown to our room but it was clear it wasn't the family room we had booked. Without any fuss, Imad invited us to go for lunch whilst another room was made available for us. Our room was in the main hotel building and perfect! Beautifully clean, spacious, and very comfortable. The bathroom was in great decorative order, spotless and with a powerful shower with no shortage of hot water. The daily housekeeping was excellent. The layout of the grounds is really well thought out. Great main pool (which we used) Zen pool for couples/people without children and a kids pool. The gardens are well tended and everything is clean and tidy. There…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

From the moment we arrived, late at night, we were greeted warmly by Imad, the guest relations manager, with lovely drinks on our arrival. First off, the rooms are beautiful. Tastefully decorated, spacious, and above all SPOTLESS. The whole hotel is absolutely immaculate, from the gardens, pools, lobby areas and the restaurants. Even after a sandstorm, all traces of dust had been cleared away in 10 minutes! The pool areas are lovely, we spent all our time at the main pool, with a great fun atmosphere, but plenty of sunbeds and such a big pool that you never felt crowded. The food was delicious, at every meal, with a great variety of…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,Amazing place,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. Beautiful grounds, very clean, plenty to do (or not if you prefer). Entertainment team work really hard to make sure you have a good time especially around the main pool, if you prefer it a little more laid back then try the quiet pool which has it's own bar area. Staff are so friendly you feel like you have known them for ages & most speak very good english. Food is good but can get repetitive, however there is so much choice you can always find something to eat. We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary & Imad the manager kindly arranged some flowers for my wife (which were amazing value at approximately £10 for 36 red roses) and when we arrived back at our room there was a cake, fruit plate, sparkling wine & a fantastic pair of…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

We were sat down with drinks and filled in arrival forms only to be told they didn't have our booking!! Booked with travel republic and had all the paperwork. Receptionist told me I had to speak to them and rang the number for me. I couldn't sort it and was getting very frustrated as I've never had this problem before. The assistant manager finally took over and said they will sort it for me but had to take £300 deposit until it was sorted and showed us to our room which was amazing. The booking problem was not the hotels fault it was travel republic but was sorted out the next day , the management came to find us the next day to tell us all was now ok.…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Our room 2161 was great near to the adults only pool which was ideal for us. the bathroom had a large walk in shower with conventional shower head and rain shower head which was lovely, there was also a good selection of complimentary toiletries. The beds were firm but very comfortable with additional pillows and blankets available. We had a small balcony with comfortable chairs and table and a drying rack which was handy for bathing costumes and towels The air conditioning was very adjustable and we were able to adjust it so it cooled the room without blasting out cold air and without the noise which was nice at night Housekeeping…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Big shout out to the guys at the food truck, they work hard all day. The girls in the kids club are amazing my daughter wanted to stay! The anination team work so hard and work long hours.

 September 2017,5,Excellent experience with superb staff,"We spent five days at this hotel and had a brilliant time. As a normally adventurous family, we were quite happy to spend almost all our time in Marrakech in the hotel, and that speaks volumes! The first point that made this such a great experience was all the extremely friendly and welcoming staff, from the team at reception to everyone working in the restaurant to house keeping. We were always greeted warmly and “no” was never an answer. The managers even spent half an hour of their busy day answering my questions on plastic waste! The rooms were clean and beds really comfortable. The hotel itself was maintained really well with great gardens. Wifi was good too. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle into town, this was really convenient and ran a few times during the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Very good hotel,"My partner and our 9 year old daughter Charlotte had a wonderful 9 nights stay at this hotel. I could not fault any aspect of our stay and the staff were really friendly, spotlessly clean rooms and all around the hotel. Comfortable rooms and the free coach to the city was ideal. Above all, the food was tremendous and the only down side being the amount of weight we put on whilst there :). Thank you to everyone who helped make this such a fantastic holiday for our family. I would definitely recommend this hotel for couples and families with young children.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 October 2017,5,Outstanding attention to detail,"Doing anything great is about doing lots of little things as well as you can and striving for excellence and this hotel has this concept nailed, we loved it! From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome and I can honestly say that didn’t change for a single moment in our whole weeks visit. I’ll have to be honest, I’d read a lot of reviews and I’d worried that either the staff would be too in your face or that perhaps some of the reviews were too good to be true, neither of those could be further from the truth. We like to be left to it and the staff respected that but they checked every now and then if we needed anything, perfect for us. You could see other customers who’s needs were greater and the level of personal service available was outstanding. The rooms…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Like the majority of the reviews on this site, we had the most wonderful stay. The hotel grounds and facilities are super, with various activities to keep you entertained throughout your stay (tennis courts, ping-pong tables, a football pitch etc). There are three swimming pools, which include a slightly more quiet one for those wanting to stay away from music and one for the young kinds. In regards to the food, there was ample choice with a slight variety each night - they tried to mix it up some nights with an outside barbecue, while there is also another Moroccan restaurant in the hotel which you can use once during your stay. Mainly though, the reason the hotel is so great and many return is due to the…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 October 2017,4,October Holiday,"Just back from short break at this hotel . Echo what most people say about the hotel. The hotel and grounds are spotless . The food in the buffet area is of a good standard but does become quite repetitive when eating afternoon and evening. They do their best to vary it with BBQs etc. We were disappointed with the a la carte restaurant. No menu and no choice of starters only 2 choices for main. We weren’t aware what we were eating and felt the whole experience was rushed. Spent less time in that restaurant than in Buffet one. The hotel is in the middle of no where but okay for a few days break. There is plenty of activities at the hotel for all ages eg archery , trapeze, tennis, the usual volleyball and football.

 October 2017,3,The reality,"Firstly i'll start by saying i'm a frequent traveller and have stayed in a good number of 'all inclusive' hotels across the world and unfortunatly this hotel is at the very bottom of my list. I'll start with the positives, it's clean and lush gardens. Yes that's correct that's it! Now for the reality i'm some would describe as a youg 40 year old and my first impressions when i walked to the poolside on day one was it had the ambience of a retiement home or maybe even a hospice and yes i kid you not. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere and if you want to buy a packet of fags then be prepared to jump in a taxi and pay £20 return for the pleasure to buy a pack of fags or just to visit a local shop for that matter. The wasp and fly problem is horrendous make sure you pack a…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

I went for a week with mu husband and it just wasn't long enough. We sometimes struggle with the food as we are vegetarians, but not here. There was loads of choice. The cocktails and drinks were fab, the bar staff were wonderful, and the animation team were just fantastic. They were so funny and engaging, they made the hotel. All the staff, the domestics, the waiters, the reception staff. Everyone at this hotel is happy, helpful and polite. We loved it so much we have booked to go back in January 2018!

Check in was not until 3/4pm but we could go straight through to have lunch and go to the pool, out bags where kept in the secure luggage room in reception. Later on our bags were taken to our room which was lovely and had everything we needed, close to the quiet pool.

Hotel was spotless, food was good, plenty of seating areas for getting out of the sun, did not realise it was still going to be that hot.

Must give special accolades to: Youssef who was working in the children's pool. As soon as we arrive he did everything to make us comfortable and alway with a big smile - what a star! Also, Rachida on reception who did so much to help us as we were sorting out taxi pick ups and other things. Ikram in the dining room always had a smile and a big kiss and attended us so promptly.

I am happy to say we were not disappointed. It is on a fantastic plot of land offering so many options on how to spend your day from the tennis courts to trapeze. It has 3 pools, kids, main pool and quiet pool which was the one we decided on. The Staff are fantastic from the pool bar lady to the manager Mr Waleed, who seemed to be available 24-7. The buffet is first class with a huge variation at every sitting. I thought that they could have made more of the Moroccan a la carte as it was only available on limited nights and only a third full when we visited it.

After finishing, the room was ready and our luggage was taken to the room by a porter who showed us the way also. The room was spotless, well laid out and well maintained although the 'all rooms have a pool, garden or mountain view' was a little bit of a let down as we had 2 trees, a constantly barking dog on land next door and a main road! The food is varied, there's a choice for everyone and I especially loved the specials area which changed each meal time. I would say though that staff should be aware that not everyone wants a 'snotty egg' and flipping it and taking it off the grill doesn't then mean it's cooked.

When we arrived we were a little unsure on how to programme the safe so we asked the reception and somebody was at our room in a matter of minutes.

 September 2017,5,Fantastic,The hotel manager was imad and he was excellent in every aspect. The hotel staff are amazing and the rooms are lovely with small balcony but lovely sunset views. The pools are clean and the entertainment is nightly at 10pm with great dancers. Weather was fab at 40oc and the hotel offers a free bus to marrakech. Once again Imad was amazing remembering the customers names we couldn't fault this hotel and it's all the running of imad. Free fridge and free safe.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2017,4,Lovely hotel with great staff,"This hotel was a pleasant surprise, beautifully kept and very clean. The staff really make this hotel, they're very friendly and always happy to help and are a credit to this hotel. The food was better than expected from a mid range all inclusive. I opt for the Tagines and you'll be very happy. The only thing missing for me would be the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,Amazing hotel,"2nd time staying at this hotel and definitely just as good the second time around :) Arrived at the hotel early before usual check in time and we were able to get to our room almost straight away. All staff are really friendly and welcoming and the rooms and hotel grounds are really clean. Food and drinks are also really good with a nice variety so you don't get bored throughout the stay. Best thing about this hotel has to be its animation team - a special mention for Amine and Momo who were so friendly throughout our stay and encouraged us to join in with lots of activities throughout the day which really made our holiday special so thank you to these 2 amazing members of staff. Iberostar is lucky to have them. Evening shows are also good fun, especially the after show…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2017,2,Won't be coming back,"Pros: beautiful grounds and clean rooms Some staff is so sweet and friendly Good food Moroccan restaurant that you can go to only one time during your stay is awesome / beautiful BUT you can only go there one time and your only other option is buffet of mad house daily Cons: First room smelled like sewer we had to switch rooms as it was unbearable First day there was a guy who verbally attacked us accusing us of stealing his towel , then attacked person next to us... which gets to next problem our towels were stolen later that day. They charge 100 dirham per towel which apparently makes them gold, kind of ridiculous when you have to watch your towel like something of value... So we problem solved and went to the other pool which is heated but apparently our kids ( who are…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,Another great stay here,"We have been to this hotel 3 times and this is primarily driven by the amazing hotel staff and in particular the animation team. All the staff are friendly and make you feel so welcome its easy to settle quickly into a relaxing holiday. Iberostar have bought the rooms and main restaurant into modern day which was needed and made some great additions like the food truck and childrens pool Special mention goes to our animation friends who we shared so much laughter with - Amine, Fati, Walid, Sali and Nezar (very talented dancer and choreographer) - they are a very special team and Ibersostar are lucky to have them My 2 suggestions for the hotel would be - review check in process to speed it up and suggest Abdel the animation manager learns more English Thanks to all the team for…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,Beautiful hotel fab holiday,"We stayed here from 11-18th September 2017. Beautiful hotel which was spotlessly clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. The animation team were amazing, always happy and polite. Nothing was too much for them. Upon arriving you need to pay your tourist tax. We paid 417 Dirham for 3 people for a 7 night stay (about £11.50 per person for 7 nights) we also paid 100 Dirham to hire a beach towel, this is refunded at the end of the holiday when you return the towel. (You can change the towel for a clean one at any time). Cocktails were ok depending on who made them. Food was varied and in abundance. Lobster, steak, lamb, king prawns & chicken, it was on the menu. Chocolate fountain with fruit kebabs, cakes, ice cream, cheese and crackers for afters. At lunch you…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Beautiful Summer Break,"We stayed at this resort in June this year and had such an amazing holiday. The hotel itself is immaculately clean and beautiful. It is set in expansive grounds with plenty of places to recline with a drink and relax. My partner and I am more likely to sit by the pool and read a book than take part in the daily pool activities; so the 'quiet pool' was our preferred place to lounge. There are ample sun loungers and shaded areas to take a break from the sun. In addition, freshly made juices and drinks are bought around regularly to keep hydration levels up which is an absolute must in the sun. The staff of the hotel are a credit to the establishment and in particular the kind customer relations manager who outstandingly remembered all guests names. The staff were friendly and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Everything was really good. there was lots of things to do from pool games, trapeze, tennis, belly dancing and much more. The people who work at the hotel are amazing, especially Sali! Sali became one of our best friends! She said hello to us every day and taught us belly dancing. She was so kind and made our holiday excellent. We hope one day we can go back to this hotel and see Sali again :)",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 August 2017,5,Amazing stay... Thanks you,"We stayed at this resort for a week in the last week of August. It was a good experience. Have to say that the staff at this resort works very hard. Kudos to them. We were greeted by Ikram and Imad on arrival and it was a very warm welcome. Imad is very friendly and always in a courteous mood to keep the guests comfortable. If I have to pick something I would state the following. Should not be seen as something against the resort, but more as some areas for improvement. a) The activity program and schedule could be advertised a bit more. Perhaps give a copy or specifically mention it when checking in. b) Food is good and a lot to choose from… but still, after the 4th day, it would become a bit monotonic so some more rotation may help. The decor ninth restaurant can also be…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,Best hotel ever!,"I would like to start by saying this is by far the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in! Not only was this hotel beautiful the staff here were outstanding! Firstly I would like to say a huge thank you to the manager Imad, you really take the time to get to know your guests and help them with any queries, you go above and beyond to interact with all guests on a personal level and ensure you remember each guest by name. This is truly outstanding and i personally felt very welcome. Imad also moved my hotel room to ensure I was next to family members also staying in the hotel, this just goes to show how much effort these guys put in to ensuring you have the best experience. All of the other staff again were outstanding. Staff here are very helpful and friendly and again take the time…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 September 2017,5,Group holiday to Iberostar....Absolutely fantastic!,"We went on a group holiday to Iberostar Club Palmerie for one week in September 2017. The hotel staff were friendly and approachable at all times and they could not do enough for you. The hotel manager Imad was very welcoming and was pleased to help with any queries we had throughout the week, he was also very accommodating in arranging rooms nearby the rest of our party. The bar staff (particularly Mohammed and Yassine) were friendly and always smiling and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them, they really made our time in the bar comfortable.

Including the poolside food truck (thanks mustafa!) The pools were clean and had plenty of things to do surrounding it, and if you prefer the quiet life then check out the Zen pool and bar for a more relaxed atmosphere. I need to shout out Imad, the hotel manager who was always around to help with anything you can throw at him! Also the bar staff (mohamed, yassine and all the others!) Were beyond friendly and really made me and my family feel at home.

Room/grounds- the grounds are beautiful with huge gardens & 3 pools which cater to every taste. A zen pool with a bar, cabanas, & lots of seating areas. The main pool which was close to the bar, seating areas, food truck, & daily BBQ' s where there were often activities such as polo, aerobics, foam parties, professional dancers etc throughout the day & a kids pool. The gardens are huge & immaculate, they are truly the nicest hotel grounds I have ever seen. The rooms are beautiful and, spacious and are immaculately cleaned each day.

 August 2017,5,"Holiday to Iberostar Palmerie, Marrakech","My family and i visited the Iberostar Club Palmerie Marrakech Hotel from 31st August to 7th September 2017. We read all of the previous reviews and were really happy with all of the positive reviews given. When we arrived late in the evening about 09:45pm the receptionist made sure we went to the restaurant to eat before checking us in as the restaurant stopped serving at 10:00pm. Everyone we met who was employed by the hotel were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel and all of its amenities were spotlessly clean, from the rooms to the restaurants to the pools, absolutely superb you could not fault it in any way.

 August 2017,5,Travel Agents Review........Absolutely Amazing,"Being a travel agent I have to say I am extremely picky with the hotels I visit and a lot of research goes into the holiday before I book. I can only describe this hotel as the BEST of the best hotels we have visited. We arrived around 21.30 at the hotel to be greeted by the friendly reception staff who advised us to go to the restaurant before check in for our evening meal. We were greeted in the restaurant by the staff and also Mr Anas Rahhouti who was the assistant director. He explained about all the different stations of food and I have to say was extremely informative and helpful. FOOD...... Wow where do I start never once during this holiday did we get bored or fed up with the all inclusive food, there was something for everybody even the most picky of eaters and…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Just something light but after traveling for 12 hours was nice! (Never been offered this option at other hotels when arriving late) The room was large and clean and always cleaned daily. The hotel and grounds was kept to a high standard. The gardeners was always working on the grounds in the 48 degree heat! The food was lovely all fresh and tasty!

 August 2017,5,An amazing hotel with everything you want and more. Outstanding service from all the staff,"We stayed here as a family of 4 for 10 days and couldn't have asked for more. The facilities at the hotel are first class with everyone's needs catered for. Our 2 young girls loved all the entertainment throughout the day especially all the dancing and foam party. The rooms were of a good size and the bathroom had a large walk in shower. The buffet restaurant covered everyone's taste buds and the food cart by the pool was a big bonus, especially the afternoon pancakes. We cannot speak highly enough of all the staff who always stopped to check we were ok and nothing was ever too much trouble. Whilst away it was our daughters birthday and they made a cake especially for her which she absolutely loved.

 August 2017,5,Simply Excellent Service,"We stayed at the resort as part of a weeks holiday to Marrakech and the Atlas mountains. It's busy but the service by all the staff is just fantastic with the CSM, Imad, setting a very high standard. We had a minor medical emergency on our first day when we needed a trip to a pharmacy and the local taxis were uncooperative. He sorted it for us - no fuss, no drama and he continued with caring enquiries every day until we left. The restaurant, bar and housekeeping teams are just delightful. The food and drink options are very good and the Moroccan restaurant is a must; book your slot ASAP on arrival. Whilst the resort is a little way out of Marrakech itself, there is an efficient and regular free shuttle into town. Be prepared for a 20 min walk each way to/from the Medina…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,"Lovely, friendly place for a great mix of relaxation and active fun","I stayed here for a week in August with my husband (we’re both 31, no kids, London-based and work full-time). We wanted to combine a lazy pool and bar based holiday with a bit of sightseeing, as well as celebrating our wedding anniversary. I’ve never done an all-inclusive holiday before – or even really a full-blown resort based holiday – and I wasn’t quite sure what to expect. I had two worries in advance – firstly, whether the food and drink would be nice, and secondly, whether on the one hand it might be too hectic and noisy for proper relaxation or on the other, whether we might get a bit bored. I was happy on both counts. We picked this hotel based mostly on the strength of the other reviews here and were definitely not disappointed. I would definitely both come back…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

The hotel is good and if you are thinking of it, we can only say do it!! I admit we were unsure before we booked but it has been truly great. Everything on the holiday so far has run like clockwork. The staff here go above and beyond to make your stay a good one. They are the real differentiator for me.... Everyone has been so friendly and helpful. I have come with my two girls and thought we may struggle at times as they could've been board (how wrong we were!!)

 August 2017,5,Great All Inclusive Hotel with outstanding service,Out travel out was via was via Ryanair and probably cannot expect more but with Ryanair these days you don't even get a seatback pocket to temporarily store things in and with just as little leg room as if you had!! Flights were on time. Luton was slow going out but quick on return and very slow inbound to Marrakech (RAK) but much faster outbound although numerous checks were made from Bag drop to boarding aircraft - far more than is normal which I guess is encouraging. Transfer to hotel from RAK was chaotic to say the least and took considerable time. Return journey was much smoother and on time. Fantastic service exemplified by Imad (CRM) through virtually every attendant or bar-person. Very wide selection of food; drinks also great were local varieties but of very…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 August 2017,5,Wonderful,"My partner and I had a short five day trip in August. The hotel was full but we were looked after beautifully by all of the friendly and helpful staff. Special mention must go to Immad who went out of his way to look after us (buying us a forgotten adapter and getting it to us the next day) and make us feel individual and special. As a couple we chose to frequent the Zen pool during the day and the outside bar at night - avoiding the loud, busy pool and entertainment. Perfect for us to relax and unwind. The food was excellent in quantity and variety and the Moroccan restaurant outstanding - the soup was out of this world! The complimentary bus into Marrakech was also excellent. Although our room was spacious, well appointed and clean is was VERY close to the outside stage…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,It's as good as they say it is.,"Everything already said about this hotel is true. The grounds are well kept, the staff can't do enough for you, the activities are different (try the trapeze) and the food is amazing. Head chief needs a pay rise. The evening entertainment wasn't for us but other families loved it. Book a couple of day trips out. I can recommend jumbo tours. The quad bikes through dirt tracks leading to a beautiful lake was exciting bit not for the faint hearted. The historical tour gave us an insight into Marrakech. Special mention to Iman (manager))and babash (lady who worked the zen pool bar) definately stay here!!",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

There was some confusion initially over our rooms (3 of them) not being next to each other, but after asking to see the Manager, Ahmed rectified the situation for us. The rooms were clean and bright and fully met our requirements and the grounds of the hotel were lovely and very well maintained. The majority of the staff were superb, ranging from the Manager to the waiting staff and cleaning ladies, always helpful, friendly and attentive. The lady who works in the Zen pool bar was regularly rude somewhat disappointing when compared to the fantastic service from other staff.

 July 2017,5,A must!,"We stayed at this hotel in July, and I must say that we will be repeating! The hotel is wonderful, clean, good food, accessible but the most important thing is the attention to detail. All the staff are continuously attentive to your every need. They are constantly asking you if you need anything and making sure everything is as you wish. I would recommend this hotel to anybody wishing to visit Marrakech. It's just about a 15 minute drive to the center, they have their own free shuttle buses or you can take a taxi which are always available from the front door.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 August 2017,5,TERRIFIC,"Came here from the 11-15th August. I had an amazing stay with my family. The rooms are nice and they get cleaned very well everyday.

Jad, who looks after kids from ages 13-17, was great at making my kids time here a blast. He took them to a disco in which they played games etc. The animation team were amazing at keeping the kids occupied and held many activities for them to do. Meanwhile the kids were off doing their activities me and my sisters went to dance with Sali (an entertainer). They had shows on at night after dinner where the little kids have a mini disco and some terrific dance shows. The service here I've found no where else.

 August 2017,4,Overall good holiday,"I think this hotel is a good 'standard' all inclusive, it was excellent value for money for a few days away in August. We had a lovely break and would recommend the hotel to others who want to relax and perhaps do a bit of exploring too. Food - The food in the main buffet restaurant was fine, there was plenty of choice and we always found something that we liked. We went to the Moroccan restaurant (one per stay) and really enjoyed the food there, although it wasn't a menu choice as we'd expected but just a set meal choosing between fish or beef for the main dish (not really catering for vegetarians either). The service in there was fantastic and we were looked after well.

We travelled with 3 boys (9, 9 & 6) and elderly parents, more so to celebrate our fathers 80th birthday. We were not disappointed from the moment we checked, with speed in which this was done and then off to our clean, spacious and modern garden facing rooms. We had 3, all next to each other which made it easier to ensure all 9 of us were together most of the time. The main buffet restaurant always had an abundant of choice despite that as our mother is a vegetarian one of the main chefs was always to hand to make any particular dish she fancied, which was VERY nice of him/them.

 June 2017,2,Good hotel but words of warning (!),"I came and stayed in this hotel with two friends at the end of June for one week and whilst our experience on the whole was great (the majority of the staff are brilliant, the rooms are clean and the facilities are really well maintained), I did feel the need to write a review, mainly as a lesson learnt that I can share with anyone else who goes here. We used the safes for our valuables the entire trip, until I forgot on our second to last night to put away a diamond necklace that I had been wearing that evening and some cash. When I came back to the room the next day, having spent the day around the pool, I immediately noticed that my necklace and the cash were no longer in the room.

We arrived in between lunch and dinner, so the restaurant wasn't open "" no problem we will open the kitchen and prepare whatever you would like to have"". That was the start of what can only be described a truly wonderful experience, nothing was to much, all the staff were friendly, greeting each and everyone with a smile. Our room was spotless and refreshingly cool from the Moroccan heat, and the hotel and grounds were immaculate. The only thing I could have a bit of a niggle about, was that all food and drinks seemed to be sugar based, which is not great for a person like me who doesn't have a sweet tooth at all.

After a rocky arrival with regards to our room NOT being ready, and having to wait due to a late check out of the previous occupant! our room was comfortable, spacious and extremely clean as is the whole resort, the management particularly Imad and the rest of the management team are very conscientious and take great pride in their guests comfort, they would check on us daily and remembered our names, went above and beyond to restore my faith in…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Although I am not a fan of buffet restaurants the staff really worked had to prepare various and delicious dishes. The buffet was continiously restocked and cleaned.

Upon arrival the bell man loaded our bags until we checked in. The reception staff were very helpful especially advising what to put on our check in forms im relation to entry number etc. One of our friends arrived at the hotel on s different shuttle as we booked separately and upon asking the staff where his room would be located they advised he was close and we ended up with rooms next door to each other. We arrived after 10pm, after Dinner sittings had finished, but reception advised us where we could find some nibbles, which was appreciated. Rooms are lovely. Clean, tidy, decent size and the shower was amazing (which all ladies will appreciate - decent…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Fully deserves 5 Stars.,"Superb hotel. The staff were fantastic, the hotel spotless, the rooms excellent, the facilities and activities well organised, the restaurant exceptional.

First impression at reception, went calm and nicely, we sit and had a drink, will the reserve details are being checked Small and easy to understand where are the restaurants, pools and bars. Super clean hotel, nothing to say about it, to see how clean it is, one person clean it up the pool chairs everyday, one by one. 2 pools, 1 for resting, 1 for animation, really good. Kids club available with activities during all day, it seems they are separated by ages. The food is varied, even for vegetarians, easy to find something different to eat during the stay. Animation team always helpful.

 July 2017,4,Fun in the sun!,"I stayed here from the 10th-17th and had an amazing trip! I was actually due to stay in another hotel but due to extremely bad reviews changed over to this hotel and I am so glad I did. The hotel itself is beautiful, lovely open plan grounds, secure and safe and lots of places to explore. There are three pools, a kids pool, a quiet 'zen' pool and the main pool where the daily entertainment and activities take place. The pools are clean and unlike some all inclusive resorts where you have to fight to find a sun lounger, there are plenty around. No chance of being bored with activities such as water polo, volleyball, trapeze swings, archery etc. There's also a free shuttle bus in to the city and an excursion desk for any adventure seekers with trips like quad biking and mountain…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

From the moment we arrived the management and staff were there to ensure our stay was relaxing and enjoyable. Visible management presence across the resort at all times and they checked regularly to ensure there were no issues. Clean rooms and a good variety of food. Good entertainment and activities for all ages, but also accommodates those who prefer quieter holidays.

 June 2017,5,Fantastic hotel,I had a wonderful time at Iberostar hotel.The staf were fantastic.It was the attention to detail I loved the most about this hotel. You really felt pampered. My mum and I were on holiday for her birthday. I would like to particularly thank the public relations manager. He always called us my name. He ensured he made himself available to check our stay was going well. We felt listened to and attended to. I was really chuffed when I returned to the hotel room on my mothers birthday to find that the staff had put roses and a heart with a special birthday message for her. they also left two glasses and a chilled champagne bottle which made my mothers day particularly special.

 July 2017,5,Iberostar has worked very hard to turnaround this hotel!,"Just returned from this hotel after spending a very relaxing week there. The hotel.......Two storey buildings set amongst beautifully maintained gardens with a childrens' pool, an activity pool and a very quiet zen pool. Lots of different activities around the gardens ie tennis courts, trapeze, exercise bikes, golf and archery to name a few. The hotel is gated and guarded by security, they also patrol around the grounds which is very reassuring. The staff.......Obviously all retrained under the Iberostar flag after the dreadful reviews from the previous owners. The managers set a fine example to their staff being very helpful and courteous at all times. Special mention to Immad who even walked around the pools to introduce himself and offer any assistance or advice. When you…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Loved the quiet pool the lush garden surroundings and the attentiveness of the staff.. the guest service manager was brilliant, the bar and diner staff were brilliant and could not rate hear enough.

I would highly recommend and gladly stay again in this hotel.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Can't recommend highly enough. Some of the best service I've received and in an immaculate hotel.,"Seldom do you receive such consistently great service from a resort. Imad in particular made us feel like we had a personal hotel manager. The staff were all lovely and seemed to take real pride in what they do. Can't speak highly enough of them. I don't have a bad word to say about the hotel either; clean, fantastic facilities, fantastic food. Some stuff I didn't realise before I went: There are multiple pools, multiple bars, handy shuttle service to the town and LOADS of stuff to do on site (trapeze, spin classes, archery, entertainment, theatre, spa etc etc). I actually feel the hotel was under sold to me. If you want to visit Marrakech (which you should) and you're looking for somewhere a bit away from the city centre, this is the place.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Really impressed!,"My girlfriend and I spent a week here in June 2017 and were really impressed. The room was spotless and really comfortable. All of the hotel staff were friendly without being too intrusive and Imad from customer services was exceptional in his level of attentiveness to everybody - he learned our names and checked in with us every time he passed to make sure we were happy, and when he overheard that it was my girlfriend's birthday he arranged for champagne and a freshly made cake to be sent up to our room. It was a really generous gesture and totally made her day. The grounds of the hotel are really well maintained and very attractive to walk around. We visited during Ramadan so the hotel wasn't as busy as it could have been - however, all the staff were so brilliantly attentive…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Staff brought drinks to sun loungers and towels available for hire. Food was excellent, bright airy restaurant, spotless clean and plenty of choice! Deserts were amazing!!

 July 2017,3,Wanted to love it; not amazing but not bad,Reading the rave reviews I was so excited to stay for five night; the hotel was an average all inclusive. My main annoyances at the hotel; No gowns or slippers in the rooms (it's 40c outside yes but in an air conditioned room it's nice to have these) No tea or coffee making facilities in the room No TV listing guide Our toiletries were not replenished on a daily basis; I had to find house keeping one day to ask for more (not really something you should have to do if the hotel really is 4*) So many wasps outside! Some of the pre-prepared meals at the buffet had no ingredients listings Other guests using the incorrect serving implements for meals and causing meat cross contamination (not sure what the vegetarian who stayed here loved about plain pasta but I found the…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Amazing 4 nights,Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of July and had the best time. The rooms are really nice spacious. The food is great both in the buffet everyday and at the Moroccan restaurant. One of the girls I was with had a very bad nut allergy and the chef couldn't have been more accommodating. Chef Mammado showed her around the buffet everyday so she knew what she could eat and everyday made her her own cake as she couldn't have desert. All the staff were very accommodating and will help you with whatever you need. There were plenty of activities put on by the entertainment team which were all loads of fun.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 July 2017,5,Brilliant hotel with brilliant staff,"Me and some girlfriends have recently got back from a four day stay at this hotel and honestly couldnt fault it. All the staff were so friendly and we were welcomed as soon as we walked through the door. Our trip was made slightly more difficult as one of my friends has a severe nut allergy, this was mentioned at check in and she was immediately taken to meet the chef (Mamado) who advised her of what she could eat at every buffet. He even made her a special dessert at every meal and we all really appreciated his amazing service. During the day there was a lot going on at the hotel and the animation team (Amine, Rasta, Morad, Abdel and Walid) ensured that there was never a dull moment (there is also a quiet pool to relax) and offered a range of activities such as archery,…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Excellent hotel,"We arrived here from staying in an awful hotel in Marrakesh. This hotel saved our holiday. As soon as we walked we were welcomed with a smile and cool drink. The staff are very friendly and can't do enough for you. The rooms are very well looked after spotlessly clean great air con ,tv and fridge also in the room. The hotel has a main activities pool with the entertainment on the go all day there is a quiet pool which has its own bar and a kids pool also. The food was good varied choice everyday. The only small draw back is the location is out of Marrakesh but the hotel put a bus on daily so you can go into town. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone really enjoyed our stay.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Fab holiday!,"Visited this hotel early in June and had an amazing stay. Hotel is really nice - very clean and nice rooms.

From the moment we arrived all of the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. They went out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Our room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. They had even given us a travel cot for the baby! All of the steps in the hotel had ramps so it was easy with a buggy. The swimming pools were excellent. Particularly the kids pool which was great for a baby and in parts was shallow enough to crawl in. The food was really good, especially all of the tagines and grilled meats at lunch and dinner.

 June 2017,5,Brilliant,Stayed with Husband and Son from 18-28th June 2017. We are not easily impressed but the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech was far superior to the other 4 star hotels we have stayed at in Marrakech. The hotel is architecturally magnificent and we particularly appreciated the quiet Zen pool. Have never seen such happy staff and were treated like honoured guests. Mealtimes were elegant but relaxed with a very good variety of food on offer. We were impressed with the courteous and professional guest relations manager who often walked around the hotel rather than hide in an office. Have finally found the best Marrakech hotel and will return in September for longer.,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2017,5,Just what we needed - thank you. 😊,"Booked through Voyage Prive, little bit apprehensive as it was our fist booking through them, but we needent have been nervous. The hotel was lovely. Met on arrival around 11am to a fruity drink and sweets whilst we checked in. Tip - don't forget about the tourist tax around £20 for our five night stay Our room was ready on arrival and a kind porter bought up our bags. Lovely room, massive bathroom with large rain head shower! Cute little balcony and the all important air conditioning! The managers are very visual throughout the hotel Imad especially - making sure to personally welcome you and remember your name!! Food is lovely, catering to the mass market with lots of option, but a little repetitive. The Moroccan restaurant is a must, beautiful food and great atmosphere. …",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
 June 2017,4,Great time here - trying really hard and it shows,Stayed here for 3 nights in this week. Booked this very last minute after the reviews at the hotel we had planned to stay at were so bad we cancelled. This hotel is a little way out from the airport and a top tip would be to book a transfer before you get here - the taxis at the airport will rip you off. Arrived at 11am and were greeted with drinks and sweets. Our rooms were ready and we were checked in really quickly after paying the tourist tax. The hotel and grounds are really clean with lots of facilities. Rooms were a good size and beds were very comfy. Shampoo etc in room and a small hairdryer. Plenty of sun beds available on the first day - much busier the other 2 days but we are up early so not a problem for us. So what do they need to work on to get a 5 star review?…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

 June 2017,5,Brilliant,"Just returned from a three night stay in this hotel with two other females. One who had stayed in two other hotels in marrakech previously. She said this is by far the best hotel she had stayed in. The hotel is beautiful, kept ridiculously clean even the grounds are kept immaculate! Staff are continuously working to keep the place clean and gardeners continuously working out in the heat. Staff are so attentive to your needs and constantly checking you are alright. Food is delicious, usually same sort of food every meal time with fresh stations cooking something different. Entertainment team also good. Can't fault this hotel and already planning our next trip.

There was a range of foods on offer each night in the main restaurant with the option to have pasta and meats cooked freshly infront of you. The majority of the food was the same each lunch and dinner time though. We were allowed to book into the Moroccan restaurant for one night. The meal was delicious!

We spent 11 days here in June.","Having recently been refurbished we were a little apprehensive but when we arrived and was met by Imad Khoudar, any doubts disappeared immediately. He made us extremely welcome asking our names, which he remembered for our entire stay of 11 days always asking how we were and if he could assist in anything then just ask. All the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating and never once made us feel uneasy.. We would like to say thanks to all the waiters, especially Rashida who served at breakfast and lunch, she was always ready to serve drinks and greeted us like friends every day .

I used the zen pool because I'm an old git. Food was repetitive as other reviews express, but there is always enough choice so you don't have to eat the same things. Every member of staff I encountered was friendly and helpful as could be with some of them struggling with English, but my Arabic & French is limited so no-ones an expert!

We had one minor issue which was immediately sorted and a free bottle of champagne and fruit provided which was a locely surprise. The only negative would be that the entertainment in the hotel was a bit ""butlins"" ...it was fine but not quote expecting the poolside sing along..ok once we got into it. Would be good if there was a bit more help with trips into Marrakech. The thomson rep who was in reception area (who was responsible for excursions) was absent more than not, and not overly helpful.

 June 2017,5,"Incredible place, amazing staff","Recently stayed here with a friend and I've got to say, it's incredible. The hotel is two floors - I mention this because when the sun sets, it takes forever for the shadow to case over the pool so you get extra sun time and my God does it get sunny - the staff at the hotel know this and despite their always being a bar open for you to get drinks at various location, waiters will come round with random ice fruit drinks to keep you refreshed and hydrated meaning you can still just lay around in the sun! There's, as far as I know, 3 pools, 1 for all activity related stuff and swimming, 1 for kids and 1 quiet area for adults, so they really do think about what people may want and cater towards it. The best thing about staying at the hotel, I have to say, it's the staff. Everyone…",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

There is a Moroccan restaurant you can visit once during your stay, we would highly recommend this. The entertainment was good too, with lots of day time activities including a trapeze which was really good!

Everyone from the bar and canteen staff were so friendly and professional. The managers regularly came to check that everything was to our liking. We really appreciated everyone's attentiveness. We have stayed at many hotels in the past but have rarely been made to feel so welcome. I must mention our regular waiter Lahsen. He went out of his way to make sure that we were happy. My wife mentioned in passing that it was my birthday and Lahsen ensured that a surprise birthday cake was baked by dinner! This is exceptional service! It is going above and beyond normal service.

As it only opened last month we thought there might be teething troubles but from our arrival to until our week was over it was definitely worth the visit. When u walk in to reception you get the felling of a Moroccan welcome , very bright in colour. The restaurant is very clean the food great with many choices without being complicated, staff welcoming and helpful.

The hotel has only been open since the start of April after being taken over by Iberostar. The resort still has a lovely Moroccan feel but is modern and refreshed. Most of the staff spoke great English however the main language spoken was French. The pools are lovely and great to relax by. The food was great, the Moroccan restaurant was very nice. Wifi was strong around the whole hotel, the included drinks were very good quality.

 April 2017,5,"Outstanding Value for Money, Lovely Staff & Beautiful Grounds!",On the basis of what we paid for our week's holiday we definitely feel the hotel more than deserves 5 stars. We have only been home a few days and we already want to go back! When you consider Iberostar only re-opened this hotel on 1st April 2017 things are already very good. If you pay a high price for a holiday your expectations are obviously much higher - we are basing our review on the amazing value for money this hotel currently offers. The most impressive aspects of this hotel are the outstanding restaurant staff (we will try to give the names of all our favourite staff) and the overall cleanliness and attention to detail of the hotel and grounds. The flowers and gardens are stunning. Everywhere is spotless. It obviously assists greatly that everything is brand new but…,Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech

Pools were lovely not sure if they were heated but once you were in it wasn't too cold. Plenty of sun loungers available but hotel was not full. My daughter loved the splash pool and the play area and I loved the zen pool my husband loved the gym. We didn't join in any sport while there as I didn't take any trainers but lots of sports activities available like tennis, basketball, spinning, Bowles, football and lots more.

 April 2017,4,Perfect weekend away,We booked this last minute (the day before flying) for a quick weekend away in the sun. We weren't disappointed. Within 5 hours of leaving Bristol we were sat in 25 degree heat. Welcome at reception was excellent and room was lovely. As we arrived late sandwiches were put aside in the restaurant which was a lovely touch. Facilities at the hotel were excellent with staff extremely friendly and going out of their way to help and keeping everything spotlessly clean. Food was excellent-make sure you reserve the Moroccan restaurant whilst you are there. Only thing that stopped this having an excellent review was an unfortunate problem with the room with the air conditioning unit leaking excessively and flooding the tiled floor.

The staff are incredibly polite and helpful and you can see how they are very well managed and they truly want to make sure no customer is left unhappy. They pay incredible attention to cleanliness!! As I was going for breakfast one morning, I saw the manager asking one of the staff to clean the floor again because there was a small line made by someone's suitcase.

 April 2017,4,Quiet retreat in Marrakech,"Our family of three spent three nights here in April, as a base to explore the wonders of Marrakech as well as the surrounding attractions. We have only positive impressions of the friendly and professional reception staff, well kept grounds (always seemed to be multiple workers keeping things clean), pools, numerous activities, relaxing outdoor dining facilities, as well as the food (excellent quality and variety). The only detraction was the high sound level of the musical entertainer who performed in the courtyard until 11 PM, somewhat disturbing early sleepers. I strongly urge you to consider this all-inclusive resort if you need a retreat from the hustle & bustle that is Marrakech.",Iberostar_Club_Palmeraie,Marrakech
