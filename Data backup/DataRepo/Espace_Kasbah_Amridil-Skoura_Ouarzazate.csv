 March 2020,5,Exceptional!,There are some places that you simply fall in love with and this was one such place!! The kasbah is also a museum with one of the most funny and informative guide (Rida) who spoke 5 languages fluently! The restaurant in the hotel is exceptional and so is the accomodation. Incredible experience and a rare find. Definitely stop here .. off the beaten tourist path on you way to the sahara,hotelName,city
 January 2018,5,THE BEST!!,"We were a group of 16 Italians coming from other places in Morocco where we were accommodated even in nice place but nothing to compare to Kasbah Amridil. Amazing place, like a castel, with simple but clean rooms, no complain at all. But the best had still to come as the dinner was definitely the best ever along our staying in Morocco and the welcome from all the staff was much more than a warm welcome. Reda, the manager of the place, gave to us useful information not only about our journey but also pleasantly talking with him regarding politics, economy, movies and whatever else interesting concerning Morocco. Last but not least, Reda the day of our leaving we had a deeply visit to the Kasbah, that I cannot what a nice experience was. Said that what more: I strongly suggest…",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 December 2017,5,Such an authentic experience! Highly recommended!,"We spent 2 weeks in Morocco around Christmas 2017 and of all the places we stayed at on the trip this kasbah was the most memorable! We drove from Marrakesh to Merzouga and this was our overnight stay on the road. We were the only guests that night, which totally added to the magic of the experience. Imagine you have your own sand castle? That's how it felt. The actual kasbah is 300 years old, but very well preserved. It's an open air museum and a big tourist attraction in the area. So being able to stay here overnight was a real privilege. The hotel section is a new addition, so the room had heating and hot shower. There is an awesome roof patio, where I spent half a night photographing the stars. The manager Mr. Reda was such an accommodating host! The night before we were…",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 April 2017,5,A place like no other,"We have just spent a night here with our three young children and I couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay. The manager, Reda, is such a welcoming, happy and gracious host and spent time explaining things, looking after us and playing with our children - even though his hotel had been taken over by a 600 strong film crew and he had a thousand other things on his plate. Our dinner was genuinely home made and the stuff of kings. The breakfast was magnificent. We loved this hotel and I hope we'll come back one day. Thank you Reda!",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 October 2016,5,Highly recommended,"We stayed three nights at Kasbah Amridil and we loved every minute of it. Here's why: The kasbah is absolutely beautiful. It has an old and a newer part, both built the traditional way. The guest rooms are in the newer part and you can take a tour trough the old part and see how people have lived there in the 17th century. The kasbah situated in an oasis, with lots of palmtrees, fruittrees and olive trees. The landscape is quite picturesque. Every morning stepping out of my room I was amazed by the stunning landscape I was seeing. The food was very good as well. The breakfast was great and the dinners Réda's wife Amina cooked us were even greater. Réda was the best host you could wish for. Réda welcomed us warmly with Moroccan tea and salted peanuts when we arrived. He helped…",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 September 2016,4,Good service,We arrived in Skoura late at night however the staff were still happy to organise dinner for us. The room was clean and a fire was lit to heat up the water for the shower which was very authentic. Breakfast was good too. Note there is only wifi in the main areas and we were the only people staying there! Also a little difficult to communicate with the staff if you don't speak French.,Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 May 2016,5,"Not just a stay, a great Moroccan experience","Yes, this Kasbah-style hotel really does abut the 17th century Kasbah Amridil. We stayed in terrace room #9. Our queen-size mattress was a little hard for us, while the pillows were perfect. The ensuite was small but clean. The courtyard was delightful and the views from the hotel were lovely. Mr Reda was our gracious host and spoke good English. He and his wife are very friendly and the dinner and breakfast (included in the price) were both plentiful and delicious. I thoroughly recommend a stay at this hotel.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 May 2016,5,Wonderful experience!,"We stayed with Reda and his wonderful family on the way to Merzouga... It was a long drive from imlil and we arrived late but Reda waited for us and prepared a lovely meal! The auberge is amazing it felt like we had finally arrived in the ancient morocco! The noise of the birds, the call to prayer and the view of the dried river bed and oasis in the distance. We stayed for one night, walked around the old kasbah the next day which is joined and part of the B&B then made our way to the desert. Thanks for a warm welcome and a great stay!",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 May 2016,5,Unique experience!,"My wife and I had a wonderful 1 night stay at Espace Kasbah Amridil. We decided on staying at this unique hotel as we were making our way from Marrakech to the desert. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. The manager, Mr. Reda, is a wonderful man who really made us feel at home. He even gave us a highly entertaining personal tour of the Kasbah which is attached to the hotel. The home cooked meal that Mr Reda's wife prepared for dinner one evening was absolutely delicious. It was great to learn about the historical significance of Kasbah Amridil and its structure is easily identifiable on old 50 Dirham bills!",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 May 2016,5,Beautiful Kasbah in the Palmeraie,"We accidentally found this beautiful Kasbah located at the edge of the Skoura Palmeraie, right next to 17th century Kasbah Amridil. It has nicely decorated rooms and a great rooftop terrace amidst palm trees and Kasbahs. Owner and staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We felt very welcome and would definitely come back!",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 May 2016,5,Short stay and lots of emotions,"Our visit was short but very intensive. In our stay we were only visitors in kasbah so we could fully appreciate hospitality and friendliness of our owner: he is not only kind and complaisant, also he is an interesting guide enthusiastic in his work and interesting to talk and to listen. For a reasonable price he showed a historical part of his hotel which is so nice to see and learn. Rooms were clean and authentic in a very sweet way. The food was VERY nice (the best breakfast and soup I've ever had in Morocco). The place Skoura is silent and good for a bike trip. Totally recomend you to visit this pace.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 March 2016,4,"A unique, memorable kasbah experience!","How often does one get to experience a real kasbah in the middle of an oasis! There were so many wonderful things about our stay here. - Early morning walk through the oasis - A tour of the famous and beautifully preserved Kasbah Amridil - Spectacular views of the sunset from the ramparts of the kasbah - Our charming, entertaining host Reda and long conversation with him about Moroccan culture, how he met his wife, his marriage, his dreams and aspirations - YUM dinner (especially the turkey kebabs were mouth watering) cooked by his lovely wife - fun playing with his cute daughter Note: The rooms are simple and small but the ambience is so genuine and unique and warm that one is willing to forgo some of the comforts that one can expect in a standard hotel.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 December 2015,5,A stand out property,"It is a rare combination of simplicity and elegance and one of the 2 very nice kasbahs where you can stay that we encountered on our recent tour - the other is Kasbah des Caids at Tamnougalt. Reda has a sense of charm and humour and looks after his quests well. The Kasbah tour is more than recommended and combines the attributes of the Kasbah and Reda's infectious enthusiasm rather well. Food is very good. You can have it in the hall or courtyard downstairs or in the terrace upstairs. I took two walks in the oasis. One early, crispy winter morning walk into the village and oasis behind the kasbah to listen to the village waking up. And a late morning walk across the dry river bed onto the oasis on the opposite bank. Both are recommended - you probably don't need a guide if…",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 October 2015,5,Great and Unique place in the middle of a peaceful Oasis !,"This place was recommended by a friend of mind who visited Morocco three years ago. I truly enjoyed this peaceful place in a beautiful Oasis. The owner is a young Moroccan, Reda, who is the very proud owner of this historical hotel. The 16th century Kasbah is still owned by the same family, Reda's family. Reda is a courteous host, who surprisingly speaks Spanish as well. I was surprised when he addressed me in well spoken Spanish. He is speaks fluent English as well. When I arrived at the Kasbah, mid afternoon, I was asked if I was going to eat dinner and to chose from the menu. I found this a bit strange, but later on I realized that dinner is cooked from scratch by Reda's wife. I would advise to eat an early lunch, because the servings are plentiful. My dinner included…",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 June 2015,5,Wonderful Kasbah hotel and manager,"This was hotel was a random find for us- and how lucky we were. The host, Reda, was so nice and pleasant. The food cooked for us in the evening was one of our best meals in Morocco. The room was clean and had good AC. It was so quiet and peaceful.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 May 2015,5,Perfect and simple place for the tired traveller,"We stayed here for one night coming from the desert and on our way to the Dadés area. The place is very easy to find, a sign will direct you left off the main road before Skoura. The atmosphere is relaxed, safe parking in front of the hotel, and basically you sleep almost inside of the kashab itself, so it is a special experience. The room was simple and clean. The bathroom is extremely small, as others before me have already mentioned and warm water is only available in the evening. Other than this, we had a friendly welcome and a quiet night here. Breakfast was one of the bests we had in Morocco: everything fresh, plenty for two, served with a smile on the face, accompanied by funny (and positive) remarks. Wi-fi is available, it works both in the room and on the terrace, but…",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 April 2015,5,"Once upon a time in a land far, far away...","By now you’ve probably read all the awesome reviews of Kasbah Ameridil, and its charismatic host Reda – all of which are true. And if you’re reading this then you’re thinking of staying here – which is something I can wholeheartedly recommend. I won’t go into details of the Kasbah tour – it is great, and you can’t really do anything like it elsewhere, so you should definitely come here and do that with Reda (just email or call him the day before to arrange it). And, unless you're enroute to somewhere else, you should really consider staying here to just decompress, soak up the atmosphere, and enjoy the environment. The Kasbah is located inside the Skoura Oasis across a wide dry riverbed, and is completely isolated from Skoura town proper. The only other people you’re likely to…",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 April 2015,3,Pluses and minuses,"The staff is very friendly, the room was clean but spartan, and the bathroom small and cramped. The proximity to the Kasbah is great, but be aware that there are two separate charges to tour the whole facility. We went for a nice walk around the oasis. The food was just adequate (and may--or may not--have been the source of a bacterial illness). We would explore other options before recommending.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 March 2015,5,lovley place,"nice place. funny friendly owner, speaks 4 languages, propper food und silence. loudest noise was the birds in the morning. a rack in the room would be a possible improvment. even werth to mention is the view from the terasse over the snow covered mountains. we had 4 nice days here and can recommend it.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
 November 2014,5,Best stay in Morocco,"We stayed in this Kasbah on our way to Sahara Desert. It was an amazing stay. The fact we staying in a 300 year old kasbah was an amazing experience, the couple who owns the place were friendly and helpful. The wife cooks amazing Moroccan meal and even showed us around the kitchen area and explain to us what the concept of tagine is like. We were the only couple that night at the kasbah, it felt amazing. We loved our stay there and will definitely recommend people to stay here!",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate

Walking around the roads in nearby you get such a sense of what this place has been for hundreds of years. Really, it is quite untouched. The new guest house part of the kasbah is literally attached to the ancient kasbah, and you can walk the grounds - a guided tour is recommended, very entertaining! If you've ever seen the movie ""Hanna"" many scenes are filmed in this old kasbah. This was one of the highlights of our trip!

 May 2014,5,One of the highlights of our trip!!,"My husband, two children, mother and father in law toured the historic Kasbah and stayed overnight in the attached modernized section of the Kasbah. It is truly magical. We stayed in a room up in one of the turrets of the Kasbah and ate dinner in the main courtyard. The dinner was delicious and was delightfully and humorously serviced by Reda. Reda who manages the property, hosted during our stay. It was such a pleasure to talk with Reda and meet his beautiful family. We had a tour of the historical section of the Kasbah that was informative and engaging. Our family would highly recommend this place to all travellers.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate

As we were dryving through the region, we were frustrated by the lack of information on how to find an appropriate place to spend the night and where to have supper.

We were tired and frustrated but the warm reception we received by the inn keaper changed our moods instantly. after receiving a wonderful Moroccan homemade meal we chnaged oue travel plans for the next day to explore the historic Kasbah, a building tha figures in many well known movies.

 March 2014,5,"Stay here, and for more than one night!","What a remarkable place! I echo the other reviewers who wished they had stayed longer than one night. It truly has the feel of being in an ancient place, with the enclosed garden, the semi-ruin of the great kasbah with which the riad shares a wall and the garden of the old kasbah, with cats lounging in the sun under a trellis of grape vines, and outside the high walls the palmeraie with its olive groves and date palms and dozens of old kasbahs and village lanes to the west, and to the east the desert... food is excellent, you can sit at separate tables but we joined with another couple from Italy at our table and had a blast telling stories.

 March 2014,5,A really special Kasbah,"Kasbah Amridil is an incredible place, built in the traditional mud and straw style (in keeping with the old Kasbah next door) it is also comfortable and modern where it matters. Reda was extremely welcoming, and gave us local dates with Moroccan tea when we arrived, and a delicious evening tagine. Located down a side road just outside Skoura, Kasbah Amridil is well signposted and easy to find even though we arrived as it was going dark (just head for the massive old Kasbah). Reda gave us a fascinating tour of the old Kasbah the next day, full of enthusiasm and knowledge of the old ways of life. The surrounding oasis is worth exploring too.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate

We stooped here for one night when traveling across the mountains from the desert to Marrakesh and wished we had stayed for several more nights. It is a traditional mud and straw building with all mod cons in the hotel part, There is an archway to the older Kasbah that has been partly restored and guided tours are provided by the local family its well worth the stay just for this! The hotel is nestled within a large palm oasis (25Km) of which you can spend days exploring, the hotel can provide guides, maps, bikes, whatever you need.

Rada was the perfect host and always took time to show us round the Old Kasbah,( An amazing place to visit) tell us stories about his ancestors and make maps for us to go biking.

 March 2013,5,Friendliest stay in Morocco,"I spent two nights at Kasbah Amridil with my parent. We were welcomed by Reda and from then until the end of our stay we thoroughly enjoyed his friendliness and hospitality. The meals that were included in the half board were delicious and served at our leisure. Our rooms had both heat and air conditioning with a remote and hot showers and there were really great common areas to hang out in. Reda gave us a map for a 2-3 hour hike through the palmeries and past crumbling kasbahs that we split up with a lunch break in the middle. The hotel was a good base for us to do a day trip to the Dades Gorge (we had a rental vehicle). Our stay at Amridil was one of the highlights of our trip,",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate

The number one attraction are the beautiful palm groves that surround it for miles around. Reda was as friendly and helpful as any hotel manager we've met - giving us information on the area, describing a hike and arranging transportation. The rooms are small but nice and have individual heaters, there is wifi on the bottom level and the food was great. It is about 2 kilometres outside of Skoura - easy by car, or a 30dr ride in a tri-moto. Highly recommended.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate

 October 2012,5,Friendly welcome,"I stayed here a couple of weeks ago. I arrived late in Skoura without having booked a hotel, but a local shopkeeper knew the owner of Espace Kasbah Amridil, who sent a guy on a moped to pick me up. The manager, Reda, gave a very friendly welcome and supplied good home-cooked food. You can hire bikes to visit the palmeraie or simply take a walk; the manager can supply a simple map with a good 2 hour route, recommended. The palmeraie is beautiful, particularly if you walk or bike to a place with a good view. Overall, I highly recommend this place: very friendly welcome, calm and quiet, right next door to the historic monument, good food and good value.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate

This means you are more or less spending the night in a monument of national importance. The rooms are not very exceptional (and a bit dusty - but this is unavoidable with mud brick architecture, I suppose), but this is overshadowed by the fact that your sleeping in an impressive fortified house, with a view over the oasis. The Maison d'Hotes is run by a very friendly and helpful young manager, who also acts as a guide to the historic parts of the kasbah, and serves lovely home cooked food.",Espace_Kasbah_Amridil,Skoura_Ouarzazate
