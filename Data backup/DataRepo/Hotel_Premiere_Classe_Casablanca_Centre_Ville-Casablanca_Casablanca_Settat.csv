 September 2022,4,Nice short business trip,I stayed this hotel as paid by a conference organizer. I did not pay myself and so my review might be biased. This hotel is one of the three hotels owned by the company running Companile Hotel which is located around the corner. The room I stayed is small but clean. There is a small desk and well air conditioned. What was missing to me was some coffee / tea with an electric kettle. But they were not needed this time because I was out of the room for almost all days during my 2-day stay. The shower’s water pressure and temperature could have been better but I guess some people don’t mind. The breakfast was decent and I wouldn’t mind staying again if it’s a day or two.,Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,hotelName,city
 June 2022,5,Good stay,"Good and clean. Staff friendly, the room a little small but it’s sooo clean. I recommend it. I stayed there only for 1 night. I had breakfast included but i didn’t wake up on time to get the chance to try it. So i have no idea about the breakfast but it looks nice.",Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 February 2020,1,Where do I even start....,So we stayed here for a week during half term we wanted to see Casablanca.... One and biggest minus in my opinion is Reception. They did 0 to assist with any of the queries. For example I asked how does Tramway line works his answer was I dont know... I was like u live here and he was like and?... I asked wnother receptionist when and guess what was his answer? I DONT KNOW. ok fair enough I asked about taxi and when again their answer was I dont know how to get taxi!!! Imagine... So the last straw was when I asked to get some assistance with rebooking my transfer as they got my time wrong. The receptionist said I cannot help you I don't know and I dont know how to use the phone.... Lets get it clear he doesnt know how to use the phone?! I just smiled and wawed what a poor…,Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,4,Clean and simple,"Everything is clean, nice and simple, i just had a problem with the bathroom sink that was blocked but they call a guy to fix it real quick, The toilet is clean but it needs a little bit more cleaning as they were some minors marks still not totally cleaned. And with the affordable price i think i will return to this hotel next time :)",Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,5,All what we expected and even more,"Not expensive, clean, comfy room. Staff was nice and friendly. Hotel is in walking distance from train station. Very satisfied.

 August 2019,5,Very helpful staff,"I always stay at Kyriad with family. This time was by myself so wanted to give it a try, honesty it was way more than what I expected. VERY CLEAN, QUIT, LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. On top of all that the Receptionist “Zineb” is always there to make my stay a magical experience she’s wonderful, excellent customer service, always smile on her face and ready to answer my questions. Was lucky that she was working at premier class that day.

 June 2019,4,"Simple hotel, but very good for what it is","Fairly new, basic and clean hotel not far from Casa Port station, around the corner from the huge Mogador/Grand Mogador hotel. Very close to a tramway station as well. It shares the building (though not the entrance or the common rooms) with the Kyriad and Campanile which belong to the same hotel company. The area immediately around the hotel is not the prettiest, but nicer areas are within walking distance. We stayed here for one night and did not regret our choice. Both check-in and check-out were efficient and professional (even though there were some language issues during check-in). We were able to use the free underground car park where a friendly attendant took care of our luggage and delivered it to our room. The room itself was not on the big side, but clean and…",Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,4,Nice and Clean,"The hotel is very charming, nice and clean with a great shower - Hard to find when you have been travelling in morocco... it's a very central hotel and they have us late checkout which was nice. Although the hotel didn't have a hair dryer.... I asked reception and the man said if I went outside my hair would be dry. A new hotel in the citycentre without a hair dryer was surprising to me... Anyways we liked our stay and would return here. Note: Picture is the view from our room.

 November 2018,5,Best value for budget hotel in Casablanca,"Only been open a few months so everything is brand new - modern style city centre budget hotel which is exactly what Casablanca needed. I paid €30 for a room which is great value in Casablanca where there are lots of terrible hotels in this price range. Rooms are small and dont expect a minibar or even telephone in the room! But there is a TV with a few English channels, the wifi and heating works well and those are the most important factors to me. They serve a continental style self service breakfast which is ok but a bit expensive if not included in your rate, apart from that there is no bar or cafe service at all. However its shares a building with the Campanille Hotel which has a nice bar restaurant and there are a few corner shops nearby for snacks, water etc. The only…",Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Hotel_Premiere_Classe_Casablanca_Centre_Ville,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
