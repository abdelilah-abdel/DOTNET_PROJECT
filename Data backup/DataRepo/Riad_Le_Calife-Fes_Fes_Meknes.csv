Right from the moment Mamoun arrived in a stylish black Moroccan uniform with a smart Fes cap and took our luggage into the Medina ahead of us, we knew we were in for something special. Situated inside one of the oldest parts of the Medina (the oldest Andalucian part as I understand it), Riad Le Calife is well, just simply stunning - everything we hoped for in staying in a Moroccan Riad and more. The decor is traditional Moroccan mixed with an eclectic mix of art, books and sculptures that reward you for taking the time to peruse through them or simply relax and luxuriate in the atmosphere of a bygone era.

The guest house is beautifully decorated with little vignettes set up everywhere you look. The styling is beautiful. I kept taking pictures to show my interior designer as I knew she would love everything about it and it would just make her happy to see. The location was also perfect. We loved being in the old medina, but loved that we were tucked away from fray. Then there is the unbelievable hospitality of Alex and Jasmine. They take you in and take care of everything.

Throughout our stay, Jasmine and her staff were very friendly and helpful. They arranged days trips for us, taxi rides, dinner reservations and graciously accommodated special needs such as early breakfasts and custom, late dinners at the riad.

I can’t say enough about this beautiful Riad, lovely hostess, Yasmine, and wonderful and attentive staff. We were warmly welcomed, sitting in the beautiful interior courtyard, with trees, birds, fountain, drinking delicious mint tea; indeed an oasis in the sprawl of the medina. The rooms were spacious, spotlessly clean, and very well appointed. Breakfast was delicious - coffee, tea, yogurt, breads/rolls/crepes, jams, honey, olives, and eggs.

The whole building seeks to recreate a Riad as was many years ago with beautiful rooms and spaces furnished with high quality antiques and careful lighting. The outcome is not Kitch in the slightest, it is simply a lovely calm place to be and relax. The large bedrooms and bathrooms reflect the names of jewels, ours was Rubis (ruby) and furnished with rich reds.

Our family of four had a wonderful time in Fes, but being able to relax and let our guards down in the peace and comfort of Riad Le Calife after time in the medina was invaluable. The medina is exhilarating and we never experienced any moments of real concern there, but one will experience there the moderate stresses of haggling, sometimes getting lost in the ""maze"", and shooing off would be ""guides"", etc. Having a first-class and professional establishment like Riad Le Calife to return home to is very refreshing.

We were lucky enough to meet his wife Yasmine as well, who is equally as hospitable. The room was one of the nicest we've stayed in. I have traveled around the world and I can not think of anything that would have made it better. The staff is amazing, there is a great little bar, and the breakfasts and dinners were impeccable.

The attention to detail and the visual aesthetic reflect a very personal eye. Everywhere that you looked had something special. And any riad that has a bar (not just a bar but one with so much mood), wins me over. All the rooms have windows opening onto the courtyard and what we loved was just the sound of the water fountain. Dinner and breakfast are served in the restaurant on the roof (at least while we were there) keeping the sounds in the courtyard at a minimum. In itself, the riad seems to be positioned well without a lot of outside noise.

I am a huge world history buff and this suite reminded me of when the Mughals ruled over India; the details in the architecture and design were stunning. It was a beautiful piece of art and I knew I had to stay here. Upon arriving, my friends and I were offered Moroccan tea and biscuits.

The location is close enough to walk to the souks, but removed enough to have a bit of peace. The best and most meaningful part are the staff and owners.

We could have done without the rock hard mattresses and 2 lousy dinner recommendations(make your own choices for dinner-and reserve before arrival) but all and all this place is a winner and our highlight stay in Morocco. Its safe to go with the owners guide recommendations and listen to their advice regarding the Medina itself. If we ever returned we would stay here again and suggest it to anyone enroute to Fes.

 December 2019,5,A magical stay in a gorgeous riad with fantastic hosts and staff,"It's been nearly 2 weeks since we checked out of Riad Le Calife and I am still dreaming about this gorgeous place. We had an unforgettable time in Morocco and this riad was one of the highlights. The entire experience was wonderful - from the fascinating approach to it, guided by the riad's staff through the dark, narrow alleys of the medina in Fes to the wonderful, warm welcome by Yasmine who opened the door to us and immediately made us feel at home, to the beautifully decorated rooms and spaces. Your first impression of Riad Le Calife, especially if you arrive after dark, will be almost cinematic in quality if you like atmospheric experiences. :-) The surprising thing is that it doesn't ever go downhill from that wonderful first impression.

We booked the Diamont suite, because we loved the red color, and omg--the most stunning room i've ever spent a night in. The breakfasts are amazing, and so was the dinner that we enjoyed at the hotel. The riad is well located in the Medina, and the hotel arranged a guide for us the first day, which is an absolute necessity (unless you have a very large ball of string!), and gave us a cell phone to use in case we got lost (which we did on the second day.

The location was perfect - a stone’s throw from the main Médina/souks and attractions (although you’ll still get lost trying to find them!) but in a nice quiet location that felt safe with no hassle. The Riad itself is a haven - a thoroughly relaxing place to be and they have thought of every detail and got it SPOT ON!

But most importantly, this gem elevates service and hospitality to a sublime level. Jasmine, Alexandre and their delightful staff seem to guess your every need from restaurant recommendations to an evening beer on the rooftop terrace. Their recommendations for restaurants and local guides are excellent and they even arrange for the restaurants to walk you over/walk you home so that you don’t get lost in the maze of the Medina.

From the moment we spotted the driver at the train station that our hosts had sent to bring us to their riad to our departure five days later, we received nothing but genuine warmth, hospitality, care and assistance that was totally off-the-charts. The initial orientation they gave us about Fes was helpful. We had made a reservation to eat at the Riad our first night and our meal was spectacular.

Our room at their Riad was beautiful and very large. Fresh fruit greeted us daily with their special cookies. This Riad is small and quaint and you actually feel like you’re part of their family.

Alex always went out of his way to suggest places to visit and even what to eat at resturants and how to navigate. The raid is right in the medina. I loved the way the raid was so beautifully decorated. Yasmine has personally taken care of intricate details at the raid. The breakfast was as expected with Fresh orange juice. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The only drawback: the water drained very slow in the shower area. But Yasmine has explained it is because of the plumbing in the medina.

It has one uncovered terrace ideal for sunning and another glass-covered one where you can take your dinner and it's a very romantic atmosphere. The location is fantastic for exploring the medina and it is also reasonably close to a major road, so it's not too difficult to get your luggage over to the riad. Yasmine and Alex run the riad and are amazingly hospitable. We saw Alex a bit more often - he has such an interesting life story of how he ended up in Fes so we encourage any guests to chat with the two. The two have big plans to expand the riad and include a pool and I'm sure they will do it in their same excellent taste.

The decoration is unique and authentic. The Diamond room is gorgeous. The room is like a palace with the wooden ceiling. Emerald room is lovely. Amber is nice on the ground floor but the room size is not as big as Emerald and Diamond. Amethyst is bit dark though. The location of the riad is also great, only a short walk to the nearby square. Alex is really a great host. He makes sure everything is well taken care of and gives us recommendation of restaurants, not only in Fes but also for our next stop in Casablanca.

 January 2019,5,We keep going back and we never want to leave!,"This was our third time back to the Riad Le Calife and as every time before, leaving has been very sad. This is with no doubts the best place that I have stayed in 20 years of travelling around the world and the only place I keep wanting to go back. It’s not only the impressive beauty of the building and the rooms, but the warmth and caring attitude of the owners and the staff, the attention to every detail. A fantastic experience, one of those places that will linger in your memory long after. The deco of the Riad is stunning, every room is beautiful and personalised with interesting antique pieces.

The Riad is like a small museum with beautiful pieces of art and items everywhere and the rooms equally nice. It is perfectly located and the roof terrace has fantastic views over the medina. We would also argue that the price is very good, as you get so much back. Thanks a lot to Yasmine and Alex for making our stay in Fez unforgettable. You are truly fantastic hosts.

Tucked away on a quiet hidden street in the Medina, this Riad is run by a lovely couple, Yasmin and Alex. The minute you walk into the Riad, you’re completely enchanted by the garden and fountain. The terrace has an incredible view of the old city at any time of the day, and you can enjoy a space outside or covered inside. The rooms are exquisitely decorated with a mix of French and Moroccan touches, and mix modern with antique perfectly.

It really makes me feel like home, and I wish I could stay for more time. The design of the Riad is a mixed design with traditional Moroccan style with a French flavor. The owners, a Moroccan-French couple, are very nice and humorous. They took very good care of us and everyone in the house. (They can even make your wife disappear if you find she is too noisy/talkative. Haha this is a joke.) They have the best view of Fes old town on their rooftop. Oh by the way, the lounge next to the rooftop looks like a Chateau, which reminds me of my days in Fontainebleau.

Yasmine and Alexandre really are the perfect hosts, and made us feel so welcome. Before our stay they were quick to respond to emails, and throughout our visit they were always on hand to answer questions. Our room, the Rubis Suite, was large, quiet, comfortable and warm. Breakfasts were simple but delicious, and we had one evening meal at the riad which featured a chicken rfissa, one of the best Moroccan dishes I’ve ever had.

They have really put their hearts into this place and it shows. It is beautifully decorated throughout, making a peaceful retreat from the craziness of the medina. They are also very good ambassadors and have a lot of knowledge and pride for their city and had endless recommendations for walks, sightseeing, eating, shopping. The entire staff was endlessly helpful and courteous. We had wanted to experience different restaurants in the 3 nights we were in Fes, and Alex had many great recommendations, but we had a hard time going outside of the Riad since meals at the Riad were so excellent.

From the moment we stepped foot into the Riad, we were welcomed like family. Of course, our stay started with delicious Moroccan tea and cakes. The owner Alex then took the time to give us a little history of Fes and the Riad itself. He also gave us tips on what to see, and what to expect from the Medina. It was a great overview! Since it was my wife's birthday, Alex and Yasmine were kind enough to give us a complimentary upgrade to the Emerald Suite, and what a beautiful room it is! Alex kept reiterating that he wanted to feel like this was our home, and we felt that it was for the short time we had there! Breakfasts were delicious, with the typical Moroccan fare.

We had fun sipping cocktails and wandering the Riad to admire and browse the collection of books, art work, antiques, and machines from times past. The location is so convenient, because it's in the Medina, yet on the edge. So you can walk to everything in the Medina, and easily get out to explore other parts of Fes.

Although it was Friday and many shops were closed or closed at noon, we had a full 6-hour tour of and a good sense of the Medina. It was a real pleasure to meet Alex and Yasmine, the owners.

There is a roof terrace with a bar which, unfortunately, the cool weather prevented us from using much. The rooms are gorgeous. We stayed in both Topaz and Emerald.

All our bags were hauled up the hill for us, which would have been exhausting without their help. Alex is a wonderful host, and has a passion that is hard to match.

As many have written before, this Riad Le Calife is a true gem. Luxury isn't so much about the number of stars stamped on a place but rather the given attention to details and needs of your hosts when you stay at one's place. And to that effect, Le Calife offers true luxury to their guests, us included. The owner Alex was our main point of contact and his assistant Khaoula which both were exemplary in helping us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay in Fes.

 May 2018,5,An oasis in an ancient city,My wife and I stayed at the Riad for 4 nights and we wished we could have stayed longer. Yasmine and her team made us feel so at home. Yasmine contacted us a week before our arrival and was quick to respond to all our questions. No request was too difficult. The service provided by every team member exceeded our expectations. The owners have maintained and decorated the Riad so well it is truly an oasis in what is a chaotic but lovely city. We had the emerald room and loved it. The Wifi in the room was a little patchy but I guess that is to be expected when you have such thick walls! The only thing I would warn is that the stairs can be a little difficult for those with reduced mobility. Overall we loved it and recommend it to anyone who wants an authentic Riad experience but…,Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes

We stayed in the Rubis room which was very spacious, comfortable and beautiful - we really appreciated all the extra details such as fruit and water popped into our room every day. To be inside the Riad is such a breathtaking contrast from the hustle and bustle of the winding Medina streets outside - it is truly gorgeous with a peaceful courtyard and a great spot on the roof to appreciate the views of the city and relax. The breakfast is very generous and the dinners are very sumptuous and tasty, and my allergy to gluten was accommodated with no problems and some extra special treats!

Bed really nice, soft pillows and luxury linens. We loved : being able to get dinner at the Riad. The food was delicious. The view from the roof terrace.....amazing.

From the very start of your arrival, the riad, provides customer service which is beyond expectations. The difference between checking into our riad in Marrakech and Le Calife were like day and night. First, our driver contacted the riad as we approached Fes. When we arrived, the riad sent someone to meet us outside the medina wall to help us with our luggage and direct us to the riad. Upon entering the riad, you are immediately met with a level of detail that surpasses anything I have ever experienced. The riad is decorated with well appointed antiques arranged meticulously.

They also helped give us a good orientation of Fes and made sure we knew where we were going for dinner each night. I was lucky to celebrate my birthday in Fes and Alex and Yasmine made sure it was special. Their Riad is so close to the medina, it is easy to walk everywhere.

Our room is very comfy and colourful. We just did a cooking class with Fatima and it was fun, I can’t wait to try it out tonight. Fez is a very challenging place to get around, I would recommend having a guide show you around the first time, then try it in your own.

Breakfast was very enjoyable, with omelettes as the cooked option, and we also had two very pleasant evening meals during our stay. The roof terrace was a great place to spend the early evening winding down after the busy day. The location proved very convenient, though typically tucked away on a narrow alley, being just a short walk down to a busy square which was on a main road leading to Bab R'Cif, the main entrance to the medina at its top end.

We spent 2 nights in the emerald suite and two in the amethyst room - both were wonderful. The location is peaceful and very convenient.

Words are wasted on the attention to detail which Yasmine has put into her little treasure. Just look at the photos.

We did the cooking class with Fatima and had the best time learning to make traditional Moroccan dishes, which we enjoyed for dinner that night. Yasmine took time to give us recommendations for each day, and arranged dinner reservations and transportation. The location was perfect for exploring the city and the views from the roof are unbeatable.

Owned and operated by a couple (Yasmin and Alex) who know what efficient and professional western customer service and logistical coordination look like, so they offer world-class service in a small personal boutique hotel. Beatiful old riad is a serene oasis, shielding you from the hustle and bustle of the old Medina. It’s evident from the many antique decorative and functional objects throughout the riad that the place is a labor of love, not just a business for the owner/operators.

 November 2017,5,Highlight of our trip!,"Nothing bad can be said about this Riad. We traveled in Spain and Morocco for 3 weeks and this hotel was the highlight of our trip. It wasn't just the amazingly beautiful Riad and the room itself, but the friendship and care we felt from Yasmin and Alex, the owners. We arrived to the most enthusiastic ""orientation"" ever, given by Alex who so clearly loves Fes and was anxious to share this with us. His recommendations for activities and restaurants were spot on. We did hire a guide thru the hotel for a whole day for all of the equivalent of $40.

Our room was spectacular! Breakfast was fabulous, and we had drinks and dinner there on our only night. Dining with fabulous food and drink outside, seeing the lights of Fez, and hearing the call to prayer was a memory we’ll never forget.

We should have booked more nights and stayed longer in fes. I like how they did the moroccan bread at breakfast, which made it more tasty than the normal ones. Eggs and hot water were served with no hesitation or long wait. That was much appreciated after we been to some other riads. Also when we left, they sent us a waiter to use the trolley to carry our luggage to where our driver parked, thats really nice.

There are many beautiful riad across the country, we have been staying in quiet a lot of them during this trip, but after so many month after visiting Marocco, only one we can clearly remember is this one. Simple reason is, of course the tasteful and very detailed decoration of the Riad, each room seems to be unique, and the atmosphere makes you feel instantly relaxed and far away of the busy Medina of Fes, while its located in the middle of it.

Our trip to Fes started off on the wrong foot when our incoming bus dropped us off at the incorrect station. Our arranged driver set by the riad was supposed to meet us at a different station. Thankfully I was able to get in contact with Yasmine who was able to inform the driver to go to our location and then proceed to take us to the hotel.

Me and my partner loved all the small and very attentive details, where you can feel that the owners put their heart into their home.

 May 2017,5,true hospitality in a stunning environment,"We found "" le Calife "" through tripadvisor and indeed all the nice reviews you read are true. The Riad is beautifully redecorated and honors the Fes cultural heritage. It sits as a small oasis of 5*luxury and tranquillity in the old médina, yet is still easy to reach by car. The warm and very personal hospitality of Alexandre and Yasmine, and their team further enhance the uniqueness of the experience of staying here. We also greatly enjoyed the cooking of Fatima. Alexandre knows his wines and we tasted some impressive Moroccan wine ( but then again he is French of course). Highly recommended!",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2017,4,In the heart of the medina,"We spent 3 nights here on our first visit to Fes and loved it. You approach up a narrow winding alley in the old city medina, but once inside, you are in a light-filled central courtyard with trees and a fountain. Jasmine and Alex, the owners, were perfectly lovely, very present, and very helpful. 7 rooms with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms face the courtyard. Rooms are small which is why 4 stars, not 5. Breakfast on the rooftop is included. Dinner there is also very good. Highly recommended.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes

Their attention to detail is superb, with every part of the Riad decorated with precision and thought. We stayed in Emerald Room which is spacious and light with the stained glass windows opening out onto the central courtyard. The details of the room made for the luxury experience, with thick weave towels, hooded bath robes, double sinks and comfy super king bed. The owners, Yasmine and Alex were both extremely welcoming, helpful, and went beyond expectations to personally ensure their guests are provided for. They have renovated the property themselves and their experience in delivery of quality shows in comparison to other Riads who have done the same.

From beginning to end, our stay at Riad Le Calife has been nothing short of exceptional thanks to Yasmine and her staff. When we arrived, exhausted from a long day of travel, we were warmly greeted by Yasmine and her staff with refreshing beverages and a lovely selection of sweets to revive us. Yasmine showed us a thoughtfully marked map of Fes and offered tips on ""must see"" places and other travel advice. She then showed us our room--something out of a palace--that left us speechless. Yasmine and her staff have clearly thought of their guests every step of the way-from a large bottle of water, treats, and fruit in the room, to amazing soaps, shampoos, fresh towels and robes, etc. The rooms look like…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes

They helped us book a spa day and told us about key places to visit in Fes. The riad was stunning and it was easy to tell that the place was being taken care of! We had dinner at the riad the first night and it was amazing!! We wish we had been able to do the cooking class with Fatima as she is an amazing chef! My wife felt sick the last few days of our stay and Alex and Yasmine went above and beyond to give her food and special tea to help her heal! We felt like we were staying with family.

My husband and I travel often and have been all over the world. The service and attention to detail at this hotel is unparalleled. Alex and Yasmin have gone above and beyond to provide excellent service. This hotel even provides a cell phone with the hotel's phone number preprogrammed in case anything goes awry (Fes seemed extremely safe--the only risk is getting lost). The staff are beyond good at their jobs. They strive for excellence here and they surpass it. If you are planning a trip to Fez this is the place to stay. I could not have been more impressed.

 March 2017,3,Lovely Riad - rough greeting,"Riad Le Calife is a lovely Riad in heart of the Medina. Nice rooms and and friendly staff. 3 star for one major reason and a few others: My mom and I were aggressively reprimanded upon our arrival by Alex the manager so we have a bad taste in our mouths. He kind've shamed my mom for a few minutes and ran about the Riad flailing his arms because we paid for a taxi instead of using hotel taxi (we had no phone service). The other reasons 3 star: we used a guide named Rachid from the hotel and were taken to a lot of places to buy a lot of stuff we didn't ask for - be wary of guides throughout Morocco (higher prices/pressure to buy)! Finally, food could be improved but in their defense Fez does not have as high of quality food in general as Marrakech.

 March 2017,5,#1 in Fes for a Reason,"Just an amazing overall experience. Stayed for 2 weekend nights in March. Room (we were in the Amethyst Room) was clean, lovely and comfortable; location was very good, just about a 5 minute walk from the Medina, and easy car/cab access. But this all pales beside the service. First of all, we mistakenly reserved the wrong days, and did not realize the problem until the night before. The reservation was changed, free of change, despite the fact that we could have been charged a cancellation fee. The basic service was also excellent. Door-to-door transit was provided for our arrival; the cab was met by a porter who took our luggage to the Riad. Everything was ready even though we arrived early in the day.

If you do have trouble with directions, the hosts will be happy to send someone to meet you and guide you there. The riad itself has tons of lovely details - a vintage victrola in the lounge, framed antique postcards, carpets upon carpets covering the original tiled floors! Yasmine and Alex are excellent hosts!

The art in the Riad invites you to stop and review it. But, it's all very calm and comfortable. I love postcards and pictures of what it was like long ago. These are all over as you go up and down stairs, and in your own suite. They have done a masterful job of making an elegant place comfortable and homelike.

Then I would enjoy an absolutely outstanding meal prepared by the cook, Fatima. I am bit picky and over the four days she learned my tastes and created outstanding custom meals for me.

My friend and I went on a 5d/4n desert tour (which was also awesome!) and we were only able to stay in Fes one night. Everyone at Riad Le Calife treated us like family and made us truly welcome. From the initial email conversations and their ability to accommodate our 1 night stay, it was a great experience. We had emailed everything in advance, and then the Riad even got in touch with our desert tour driver to confirm day-of logistics for drop off at the nearest parking to the Riad. We stayed in the Ruby Room at the top of the Riad. This is the same level where you can enjoy rooftop relaxation and dining.

The hotel itself is absolutely stunning, and intimate. The staff is extraordinarily friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to help their guests in every aspect of their stay. Before we even arrived, Fatima-Zahra was extremely helpful with coordinating our stay via email. I was able to work with her to modify the dates of our stay and arrange ahead of time a pick up from the train station.

They all do a very good job taking care of logistics for the guests and explaining where to visit and where to eat. The tour guide they hired for us was also excellent.

No fault of the Riad - just traveler's fatigue probably and the change of weather. So the staff at the riad went out to the pharmacist and bought me medicine. They were at my beck and call the whole day and served me tea in the terrace. They brought me blankets just in case I'd want it. And they regularly check in on me without intruding on my privacy.

Stayed three nights in the lovely Topaz room and enjoyed fine dining on the rooftop terrace with its incredible view - some of the best food I ate in Morocco. The owners and their staff were gracious, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful - from trying to solve my cell phone problem to arming me with maps and information to successfully explore the medina on my own.

Breakfast each morning on the roof top was fantastic, with a great view to go with it (possibly my favorite view of all the cities we visited on our trip to Morocco). We also had dinner there two of the nights, and the food was outstanding. Great location within the Medina, and easy walking distance to a majority of the sites/things to do in the Medina. The rooms are very comfortable and nicely decorated with local Moroccan goods (intricate metal lamps/lights, Moroccan rugs, orange blossom scent in the air, etc.). The owners told us to feel at home when we arrived, and it wasnt more than an hour later that we truly did feel at home.

They, and their staff truly made us feel welcome and their love and passion for their riad, for fes and morocco really shine through in every interaction. Advice: - we took a smaller room, which was fine as we spent most of the time out of the riad or relaxing in the common area - eat dinner there one night.

Yasmine, Alexandre, Fatima and Frouke went out of their way to make us feel at home; we got a tour of the Riad on arrival and sat down over a map of Fez while Frouke pointed out the highlights of the city. The decor in the Riad is straight out of 1001 Arabian nights, very fitting for an old city like Fez. Each room is decorated differently, coloured windows to the courtyard add a lovely touch. The rooms are somewhat dark, but that is normal in many riads, as the windows generally face a courtyard which limits the light.

Fortunately we had our money and valuables with us. When we alerted the management to this incident, they did admit that Alex, the manager went into the room to turn off lights that were left on and were told that he would never have touched our belongings.

The Riad facilities and rooms are beautifully decorated and very comfortable, but the main reason to stay here is the kindness of Alex and Jasmine and their staff. Our stay was memorable in so many ways. Every time we would thank either Alex or Jasmine they would say""my home is your home"" and they meant it! We stayed for four nights in the Rubis suite which I believe now is called the Jewel Suite. it is up several flights of narrow stairs but has a private veranda and is adjacent to the roof deck. We ate one dinner on our arrival night which was very good. The breakfasts were so good and they serve eggs on request. Please do yourself a favor and stay here!

The rest of the Riad was beautifully decorated with well kept gardens and a lovely terrace for both enjoying a drink watching the sun set or having something to eat.

We later realised that a riad is a completely different experience from a typical B&B / hotel and in many ways much better! LOCATION: The location of Riad Le Calife is great – it is easy to navigate.

Extremely helpful, they just want you to love your stay not only at their Riad but in Morocco as a whole. They were VERY good at reading their guests. That takes effort certainly. We always felt attended to and comfortable. They also have a nice way of ensuring their guest's security by making you leave your room key with them when you leave.

 December 2014,5,Beautiful Riad in the Heart of Fes,"We spent 3 fabulous nights staying in the Jewel room of the Riad Le Calife, a quiet, elegant and very tastefully decorated boutique hotel in the Fes medina. The room was large and comfortable - a luxurious place to retreat from the frenetic city outside. Yasmine and Alex were incredibly hospitable, thoughtful and helpful - providing us with a lot of information and guidance about the best places to visit and helping us with restaurant bookings. As a gay couple we couldn't have felt more at home. We thoroughly recommend this as memorable place to stay in this beautiful city.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes

The large bath and bubble bath is very much recommended after a day expoloring Fez. Our hosts Yasmine and Alex were the best - nothing was too much trouble, they advised us on the restauarants, shopping and arranged guides to collect us - and walk us to the restuarants ( saves many hours trying to find it on your own), they advised us on where to buy lanterns - these were quality items - with no hassle from the seller and they were then delivered to the riad packed, for us to carry home. The food in the riad is also second to none - the lamb tagine being the best we have ever tasted.

The rooms are lovely with comfortable beds and huge soft towels. If you prefer to not climb steps, ask for a room on the courtyard. The view from the roof is outstanding and having fresh, hot mint tea at sunset while hearing the call to prayer will stay in my mind for years to come. Tonight we ate in the dining room and had a tasty meal of soup, chicken tangine (we prefer to not eat red meat) and a beautiful poached pear with toasted sesame seeds and other traditional sweets. The dining room is warm and cozy with music of the early days of jazz. You feel like you are whisked back to a simpler time.

We stayed in the Amethyste room and the Emeraude suite - both gorgeous. Loved waking up to the light coming through the stained glass windows. The breakfasts on the terrace were delicious. A set menu for dinner is available by pre-arrangement and we had this twice - on the first occasion we felt we had too much food, and the owners were more than happy to suggest we only ordered for one person and shared.

It is a wonderfully decorated riad - there is an amazing air of tranquility the moment you step inside. The room was immaculately clean and the aircon was sufficient. The bedding was comfortable and the bathroom more than adequate. At 100€/night it was great value. The hosts Alex and Yasmine were so friendly and helpful. On check-in it was great to have all the local hotspots marked out on a map, so as not to miss out on the ultimate Fes experience. Would definitely recommend this riad to anyone travelling to Fes.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes

She explained that working at Le Calife is like being a member of a family, all of whom are dedicated to helping their guests have a memorable stay. We loved the peace of the courtyard and the ambiance of all the little areas like the bar, the library and the magnificent views from the roof terrace.

 November 2014,5,Nicest people in a gorgeous setting,"In Fes, on a business trip, I chose Ryad Le Calife as it seemed to be both charming and practical. I wasn't disappointed. The building is beautiful with very spacious rooms and an amazing courtyard and terrace. The food is delicious: at breakfast everything is home made (bread, pastries, jams etc...), every night, when I came back to my room, there was a plate of fruits and Moroccan pastries. The location is brilliant: you are in the Medina, but very close to one of the gates, so getting picked up by someone with a car is very easy. They are linked to the Palais Farage, so if you want a posh dinner or a spa treatment (amazing hamam and massage), they'll organise it for you (good discount on treatments as well ) and will even get the chauffeur to pick you up/bring you back. …",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes

We enjoyed two evenings at Riad le Calife and would recommend it to anyone. Alex and Yasmin's arranged for us to be picked up at the train station - which we recommend to help find the Riad. While it is not hidden, it does take some orienting to remember its location. Upon our arrival, we were told to make the Riad our home away from home - and we were not disappointed. The room (Ambre) was cozy but well appointed. The breakfasts were just perfect each morning. The Riad is quiet but be prepared to enjoy the cacophonous call to prayer from the dozens of mosques in the city.

Nothing is too much trouble and we receive great help for restaurants, shopping, sending packages back home, taxis, transfers etc. We ate at the Riad one night and it was the best meal of the 4 nights in Fes. The views from the terrace and restaurant would rival any view in Fes. We had to leave at 3.30 am on the last morning and they even packed us a small breakfast to take with us.

There we were met by Alexandre who was a perfect host (As was Yasmine) and shown to our suite which was perfect, leading out to the terrace. We ate at the Riad on our first night and the food was flawless and a perfect example of Moroccan cuisine.

The riad is worth spending some time in to appreciate the attention to detail as you notice the thoughtful decorating and precious antiques adorning every area.

The Riad reveals itself slowly as you enter the nondescript front door through low ceiling spaces to arrive at the central courtyard open to the sky. The courtyard is the perfect spot to relax with a mint tea or a cold beer served from the ground floor lounge and bar. Meals are served on the open roof terrace with magnificent views over the bowl of the Fes Medina. The interior design, decoration and attention to detail is first class.

To be recommended is a cooking class with the very lovely Fatima. Fes medina can be a handful to find your way round so we were helped by the very kindly Yousef. A hamman and massage can also be arranged in a near by spa to revive tired muscles. Many thanks to Yasmin and Fatima for the lovely birthday meal and cake arranged for my husband.

Our beautiful room had complimentary fruit, pastries, water and soda. The owners were most helpful with suggestions for restaurants, a guide and onward travel. Fatimah's breakfast and our one dinner on the lovely rooftop terrace were the best in our eight days in Morocco.

Not only were we met at the train station but when we arrived at the closest place to the Riad where a car could go - not the front door of the Riad - there was someone with a luggage cart to transport our bags to the Riad. Otherwise I am not sure we would have found the Riad from where cabs can drop you off. Everyone at the Riad is very helpful: Yasmine, Alex, Chaimae.

It is also rated the number one hotel (not B&B) in Trip Advisor, which is a significant achievement, since Fes has a larger pool of rated hotels, B&Bs and inns than everywhere except Marrakech.

A bit overpriced so I would suggest staying at the riad for dinner (based on other reviews) and perhaps visiting Palais for a drink. If traveling with kids note that there is no pool which the kids found disappointing. For us, it was by far our favourite riad in morocco and I would highly recommend staying here.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2014,5,Our favourite Riad of our trip,"We spent 2 nights of our 8 day travels through Morocco at Riad Le Calife, 6 different Riads and this one was our favourite. Fantastic views from the rooftop terrace, do book a dinner here, it is fantastic. Plus I am still dreaming of those amazing dates at breakfast.... Great location for exploring Fes. You will not find friendlier people, from the owners to the staff. Lots of nice personal touches that we did not experience anywhere else.

 April 2014,5,fantastic place fantastic people,"The Riad Le Calife is its own world - one of beauty and calm - in the midst of another world, the bustling, labyrinthine, challenging but fascinating old medina of Fez. The entire team at the Riad engage in a cheerful and helpful way to make your stay special from the moment you arrive to the time when you sadly must depart. We stayed in the Ruby suite and could not fault the room for size, decor or comfort. The attention to detail in furnishing the room is amazing.The room and indeed the entire Riad display the best of local artisans, antiquity and craft whilst still being comfortable and practical.

It was therefore pot luck that I picked Le Calife in Fes on the booking.com site once I completed my High Atlas and Erg Chebi desert adventure. I travelled to many other locations in Morocco over my four weeks there but Riad Le Calife remains my favourite place for sleeping, eating, day tripping and taking in the medina views from the rooftop terrace. The location is wonderful- close to the medina yet peaceful and easily accessible. I so enjoyed hearing the background story of the riad from Alex and Yasmine, its owners, and spent quite some time looking at the beautiful interiors and decorative pieces collected by them over the years in Paris and Morocco.

Their entire staff follows up on every minute detail or possible concern. The riad is beautifully appointed and you can tell how much thought went in to making it special with all the beautiful antiques. After 11 days of all Moroccan food we expressed our need for something different. Their other family owned hotel/restaurant, Palais Faraj, is outside the medina situated on a hill overlooking the town and medina. Spectacular view and spot on customer service!

Sadly we were at Riad Le Calife for just two nights but with help from Alexandre and Yazmine, we made the most of our short time in this intriguing city. After staying in a couple of other lovely but more basic riads in Marrakech and Boumalne, we appreciated the more luxurious feel of Riad le Calife. Service was also a notch above our other experiences with a gracious staff happy to help in planning two perfect dinners and a walking tour that maximized our exposure to the many lovely parts of the medina. Our only regret is that we ran out of time at the end of our trip and did not have another night to spend in Fes.

There is a lovely sitting area with almost floor to ceiling windows with stained glass. The bathroom has a huge tub, shower room, double sinks and a separate toilet room. We have two entrances. I could go on and on. Breakfast was lovely with too much food with lots of variety. If you want to splurge in Morocco, this is the place to do it. (I think it's my favorite hotel room.)

On one of the days, we had dinner at the Riad & the food was exquisite . I had the lamb tagine & it was outstanding. I had lamb tagine at another restaurant but it was no where as good as what Fatima prepared for us.

Always making sure you have everything you need or want. Breakfast was very good with an assortment of breads, fruits, hard boiled eggs, olives, cheese and meats, fresh juice, coffee and tea.

The terrace was wonderful with great views. We watched the gold-medal Olympic game here with olives and beer - spectacular. Similarly, any questions/concerns were addressed right away.

I should mention, as another reviewer also noted, that the Wi-Fi internet is indeed spotty and intermittent. Also, their internet has significant limits as to the size of e-mail attachments.

Yasmine and Alexandre were very helpful both before and during our stay. Originally 9 nights were booked, but the my partner was concerned this may be a bit long in one place. Even though they missed out on a couple of nights of occupancy Yasmine recommended a trip to Chefchauhen (a definite addition to our trip) and it was lovely to return on my birthday to the Riad.

It was as beautiful as the pictures show and our room was enormous and luxurious. We were very impressed with all the staff who were, without exception, warm, helpful and very accommodating. The owners who were, unfortunately, tied up with a family emergency still made the effort to come by and greet us and welcome us to their small hotel. The breakfasts were plentiful and served with a smile. I was fortunate to spend several hours in the kitchen with Fatima learning how to make couscous and several other dishes which were served up for dinner that evening.

There is a reason why Riad le Calife is number one and that is because everything is flawless. The location - is very good, very close to the main road in the medina, close to a parking place (if you arrive by car) and very easy to remember how to get there (unlike in Europe or USA, it is better not to be in the center of the medina). If you want to go out after it gets dark, they will ask someone to accompany you to the main road which is roughly 2 minutes walking distance.

They greeted us every morning to make sure everything was perfect for our stay of three days. They were helpful in recommending restaurants. In fact, we took the cooking class with the wonderful Fatima, the chef, on our last day and ate dinner that evening in the small, romantic dining room tasting the fruits of our labor!

We adored all the shared spaces (like the courtyard, terrace, the bar and the breakfast room) which were elegant and relaxing. The Riad is small with only 7 rooms. We stayed in the Opaline Room and it was spacious and gorgeous. The bed was comfortable, there is a small couch in the room, stunning stained glass windows and the bathroom was enormous. We ended up eating dinner at the Riad on both nights and would definitely recommend you have at least one evening meal there - the food was delicious and they were probably the best meals we had while in Morocco.

This riad was right in the middle of it all, but the fact it was next to the Cinema Amal made it very easy to negotiate from the point of view of cabs, getting people to help in terms of directions etc. The riad was really something else – a real jewel in the middle of this wonderful chaos that was the medina outside. The place was wonderfully decked out in antiques and paintings, the top of the riad had a wonderful view towards the whole Fes medina, breakfast was excellent and the rooms were incredibly lush and comfortable.

The meal was delicious, and very generous, with nine starters just for the two of us. The Riad is well located, right in the Medina.

Before we arrived, during our stay, even after our departure the service was outstanding. Our room felt like we were in a Sultan's palace. Dining was intimate, if not exotic.

 September 2013,5,A great stay,"Based on the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor, we stayed several nights at Riad le Calife -- and it completely lives up to the hype. A large and beautiful riad built around a garden-like central courtyard, with a beautiful roof deck and a fantastic view overlooking Fes. We were told that riads in Fes tend to be larger than those in Marrakech (often 3 stories in Fes, and were once the homes of nobles; riads in Marrakech tend to be 2 stories and would have been owned by merchants). We stayed in one of the smaller rooms on the ground floor, which was more than large enough for a couple.

A sumptuous breakfast was served on the roof terrace with incredible views over the Medina to the surrounding hills.

This elevates even the most ordinary abodes into a princely home. The couple were very helpful and attentive. It also helped that Yasmine's father owns a spa nearby (part of a hotel) so one can enjoy a hammam in a friendly establishment. It is called Palais Faraj. It is located in the southern part of the medina of Fes and close to Avenue Recif. So it's a short convenient walk to any motorised transport.

We arrived to Fes by car and they sent someone to wait for us at the closest parking to the riad, so he could not only help us with the luggage but also get us to the riad, which is not an easy task. Our room (Amathyste) was big, beautiful decorated, comfortable and quite. The ground floor patio, cool and nice, was a lovely place to share a tea after a busy day in the medina, and in the terrace, with its impressive view of the Medina, we had 3 very good breakfast and 2 even better dinners.

Perfect welcoming service prior to arrival? - Yes, of course. Charming Management? - Absolutely and even more than you've expected.) Rich and colourful traditional interior? - You'll be surprised even more!) Nice dining experince is there as well. Not to forget spacious, cozy rooms and very realistic room photos on all sites.

 August 2013,5,A delightful place in the heart of Fes,"We arrived at this oasis after a 5-hour stifling journey on a train from Tangier to Fes. The taxi driver who drove us from the train station called the Riad who sent us one of their men to meet us in the main square where the taxi dropped us off. This gentleman then took our luggage and led us up the alleyways to the Riad door – an imposing door set a little apart of the walkway up to it. Like most Riads, (or for that matter, medressas and other well-constructed buildings) in Morocco - you cannot tell what beauty, tranquility and comfort awaits you from the exterior of a building. Whatever the reason for such construction, the contrast certainly serves to heighten the impact on your senses upon entry.

 September 2013,5,Enchanting and superb,The common areas of the hotel were beautifully decorated and extremely peaceful. We particularly enjoyed sitting in the lovely courtyard sipping mint tea and munching on moroccan pastries while listening to the fountain and the birds. The rooms were finished to perfection and very cosy. The attention to detail was remarkable. We highly recommend the diamond suite...your palace away from home! The service was impeccable with Yasmin and Alex being the most attentive hosts we encountered on our vacation. The in-house restaurant is excellent and highly recommended. They were extremely considerate of specific dietary restrictions. The hotel has an excellent location within the medina. A couple of notes about Fez in general: 1.

 August 2013,5,"Elegant, authentic, and fabulous location","This is a wonderful Riad in the heart of old Fez. It is a beautiful Moroccan home that has been renovated into a guesthouse with only 7 rooms but feels spacious and private. The owners, Alexandre and Yasmine, have done a wonderful job making sure that the rooms and the property are authentically Moroccan, incredibly comfortable, spotless, and that you feel as if you are staying at a wonderfully wealthy friend's house. We ate one dinner there and it was absolutely scrumptious. For our second night we wanted to try a new place and Alex recommended a wonderful restaurant overlooking all of Fez, called Palais Faraj.

 February 2013,5,would come back to Fes just to stay here,"I entirely agree with all of the glowing reviews of Riad Le Calife...it really is that good. We stayed here in February 2013 for 3 days. We reserved another room, but were kindly upgraded by the owners to the Amythest room. This was one far and away the nicest place we stayed in Morocco. First, I would certainly agree with having transport arranged by the Riad. We arrived via train from Casablanca, and after numerous annoying taxi encounters it was a relief just to not have to worry, even if the price was a little more than could be bargained. The Riad is near the movie theater and near the Medina, and the hotel staff met our ride and walked us and bags up the relatively short path.

The riad is owned and managed by a maroccan-french couple who is putting its deep passion to this property and project of life. The result of their efforts is a wonderful riad, very well managed, with both a friendly and professional attitude. Starting from the moment of resevation and throughout the stay, we felt discretely cared (attentive info and real time assistance for getting there, useful suggestions for the city's visit, etc).

At our destination, in a hidden corner of a little unassuming alley, there was a big wooden door. When we entered, there was a small corridor, which led to a vast court yard with trees lit by candle lights. There was no street noise, no music, only the sound of a little fountain. My wife and I were immediately and enthusiastically welcomed by the owner Alex, who gave us lots of information about his little palace and its history. Our room overlooking the court yard was tastefully furnished and decorated. We fell immediately in love with this place.

Le Calife is a three-storey building, beautifully and tastefully restored, designed around an inner courtyard and 2 terraces overlooking the medina (old city). All rooms are nicely appointed, exquisitely decorated, spotlessly clean , and open towards the patio with the relaxing sound of a water fountain and chirping birds.

We had booked the Amethyst Room for our four-night stay and ended up only spending the first two nights there as Alex and Yasmine upgraded us to the Diamond Suite as a birthday treat for our final two nights. The Amethyst Room was stunning already, with a huge bedroom, lovely bathroom with a shower, and a separate dressing/storage room to keep clothes and bags in.

 April 2013,5,Best Riad in Morocco,"We were hesitant to book a trip to Morocco as it was a bit intimidating. Fez was a great introduction, mostly due to the amazing stay at Alex and Yasmin's place. Hospitable hosts, attentive staff, gourmet meals cooked by Chef Fatima (you don't have to eat anywhere else), and what a beautiful place - any piece of decor could fit in my house perfectly! The rest of our trip to Marrackeh, Essaouria and Casablanca didn't measure up on all counts. Our guide Houssine, referred by Yasmin was the absolute icing on the cake. A true gentleman, no pressure imposed whatsoever when he took us to the various shops in the medina. We bought brass lamps, leather goods and ceramics, all hand crafted and not to be found in the other cities.

 April 2013,5,It's all true,We stayed for four nights from 21st April in the Emerald Suite. When one arrives the impression is - this will be fine. But then Le Calife wraps itself around the visitor and by the end one realises that this is a very special place. The facilities are incredibly welcoming and tasteful but it is Alexandre and Yasmin (and Darwin!) that make the place so great but then so do all the staff who are universally lovely. We ate Fatima's cooking on night one and there was no point thinking about eating out thereafter. My wife spent a very enjoyable afternoon cooking and learning from her. We got tips and help about how to enjoy Fes and thoroughly recommend a guide for the first day tackling the Medina.

They welcomed us, explained about the city, matched us with excellent external tour guide and gave answer to everything we needed. The Riad is located in the Medina, a little before the market and small maze streets, so you can reach it by Taxi and be in the market by few steps.

We had such a great time that we're already planning our return trip! Not only is Fez a fantastic city, but Riad Le Calife was the perfect place to stay. It's such a part of the city that local knowledge is needed to get you to the front door the first time - but don't worry, the owners will send their bellboy to come and meet you as soon as you're in the area. Alex and Yasmine were very warm, friendly and helpful during our stay, giving us advice about routes to follow, places to eat and millions of other helpful tips about Fez. We stayed in the Ruby room, which was beautiful, and of a quality that would cost you at least twice as much in Europe.

Everything has been thought out down to the smallest detail, and the feeling you have while you're there is one of being a welcome guest in a luxurious home. When you enter the building you find yourself in a beautifully tiled courtyard with a bubbling fountain and birds singing among the trees and plants. I stayed one night in the Opaline Room, a beautifully appointed room with tall windows opening onto the courtyard.

You get delicious mint tea on arrival to sip while they give you a run down of the riad and the surrounding areas. The rooms were spectacular! We were in a pink one to begin with then swapped to the Emerald Suite. Upon departure my partner had to prise me out of the room, I didn't want to leave :-) The food was delicious, we ate there both nights.

It is extremely well decorated in traditional Moroccan style, the terrace and the bar are really nice. The owners are extremely friendly and very helpful. The breakfast is traditional Moroccan and is quite good - one of the best we had in our 10 day Morocco trip. We stayed in room Ambre, which is one of the 'basic' rooms and even though it was small we did not miss anything and felt comfortable. The location is also good - just on the edge of the Medina even if it was hard to find the first time we were there.

The attention to detail in this Riad reflects the enthusiasm of the owners. You could tell that everything was designed and showed the love the two owners have lavished on this hotel. It has a real 'soul' to the place, one that is immediately felt on entering. Alexandre's and Yasmine's taste and discretion shine through in every little corner and in every perfectly placed object.

It is centrally located for the madina, the owners go out of their way to be helpful and friendly. We found their enthusiasm infectious. Our room (Amethyste) was traditionally furnished and the windows were stained glass. A rain-bath shower (rather than the traditional spray) would have made the experience 110%.

We stayed in one of the suites, but each room is special and unique -- you really can't go wrong with any choice. The courtyard, bar and dining room are equally as charming. The rooftop terrace looks out upon the whole medina. We ate dinner at the riad all three nights of our visit, and the food, as others have said, was phenomenal (a different meal each night).

Beautiful space, lovely common areas (a terrace, lounge, courtyard), and the owners and staff really made you feel welcome (always smiling to welcome you back, and willing to chat but never being overbearing).

The riad has a terrace on the roof, and it has a great view of the city. We recommend going up there just after sunset, when the sky is dark blue, for a stunning view.

Of course, as mentioned in so many of the reviews, the hosts were always there to help and guide, yet a very subtle presence. We are not super ""bed-and-breakfast"" types, but this was just the right balance of being in a hotel and being in a property that the owners had put their heart and souls into.

 November 2012,5,Outstanding!!!,"Words cannot express the experience of staying at Riad Le Calife. Beautifully restored. Best breakfast. Alexandre, Jasmine and the staff cannot do enough to make your stay memorable. Had two dinners here - absolutely the best! Close to all of the action. They make this your home! And there is Darwin if you would like a most gracious pet. They also arranged tour guides for us - definitely recommended. We stayed in the emerald suite. Large, comfortable, private. Wonderful views from the two terraces. A must place to stay in Fez.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,Beautiful retreat in Fes,"We arrived later than anticipated to Riad Le Calife our first night in Fes. Sumiya, the hostess that evening, was incredibly accommodating and arranged for a ""light"" supper since we did not reserve dinner in time. It turned out to be an amazing meal and just what we needed to ease into our stay in Fes. The next morning we were greeted by Alex and Yasmine, the owners, and their Jack Russell terrier, Darwin. On Fridays the Medina closes midday for prayer. It was the perfect time to wander about and get lost since our tour guide was scheduled for Saturday. We also got the opportunity to take a cooking class at our Riad with Fatima. It is tradition to cook couscous on Fridays since it is such a lengthy process. I can't explain how great and patient she was with us. If you…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,An absolute jewel,"From our reading of previous reviews we had high expectations of Le Calife and we were certainly not disappointed in any respect. In fact it exceeded even our most optimistic hopes. The building is superb, beautifully Moroccan but with obvious added French flair in design, the breakfast easily the best we have had in Morocco, but it is the people that really set Le Calife apart. Unfortunately we did not meet Alexandre, who was in Paris during our stay, but Yasmine was special, as were her staff. Thank you so much from both Gaye and myself. We will always remember Le Calife and will recommend it everyone we know without hesitation.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,friendly and central with beautiful rooms,"My wife and I traveled with her mother, so we had a room upstairs, Emerald, which was a delightfully large room with well appointed ensuite. The Riad is well located, at one end of the 'blue' medina walk, close to the main road, about 200m into the medina. Of course they meet you at the airport, and carry your luggage etc, so you feel like royalty. Breakfast is substantial and delicious. We ate one night in the Riad, couscous of course, and it was the best we had in Fes.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,A diamond in the rough,"The medina in Fes although amazing with it's history can be exhausting and bustling during the day. We always looked forward to arriving back at Riad Le Calife after roaming the medina. It truly is a diamond. Walking into the Riad, I felt like I was surrounded by luxurious Morocco. Yasmine, Alexandre and the rest of the staff make you feel apart of the family. This is something I do not experience at any american accommodations. Our room was comfortable, luxurious, and clean. The food was beyond amazing and till this day I miss it! I have no hesitation in recommending this Riad to anyone.

 October 2012,5,An absolute delight,"This wonderful Riad scores full points on every aspect. The room is beautiful, with great attention to detail. The building is stunning, with a lovely courtyard and rooftop terrace. Mint tea is free and always available. The views from the rooftop terrace are wonderful. Dinner is fantastic, though there is too much of it!!! The owners and staff could not be more helpful, and it is in a convenient but quiet location. It doesn't get any better than this. Lots of nice places to relax when you need a break from the souks. We also like Fez very much - less hassle and fewer tourists than Marrakech. Very good for photography. This Riad is very convenient for the souks. Thoroughly recommend and will return.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2012,5,A perfect Riad in Fez,"The riad is owned by a lovely couple who were very helpful with places not to miss in Fes as we were only in the city for 1 night. The room was the best of all the places we stayed in whilst in morocco. The raid is a wonderful mix of Moroccan decor and modern touches like wifi & cable TV. We were welcomed with sweets & fruit in the room and departed with pastries! Not only was the room great there is also a bar and roof terrace to relax in. They recommended to us a restaurant called Cafe Clock which was a great evening of food and music with a mixed crowd. The breakfast was also fantastic, all I can say is you won't be disappointed with anything if you stay here. I would advise to call ahead as the riad is a little hard to find the first time.

Fes is a marvellous city, and the hospitality offered by owners Jasmine and Alex and Soumia, the assistant manager, is exceptional, as is chef Fatima's exquisite cuisine ( don't pass up the nugat glace!). The decor and personal style of this riad are exemplary. Service overall was impeccable and the special warmth and extra efforts Jasmine, Alex and Soumia made to make us feel at home and to enjoy the very best that Fes has to offer made this an absolutely memorable trip.

From the moment we arrived it was a truly wonderfully serene and beautiful experience - it thoroughly enhanced our journey. Yasmine and Alex were very hospitable and offered as little or as much help as we required. The riad itself is bliss - it is very tempting not to leave the compound at all! The terrace is an explosion of lemon and berry trees with intricate mosaic and wooden work. The rooms are tastefully authentically decorated, with all the mod cons and lovely little perks (sweets and fruit).

 September 2012,5,Outstanding riad,"We stayed in the Diamond Suite for two nights and only wished we had stayed for longer! It was magnificent. The suite was so comfortable and beautiful that it was tempting to retreat from the wonderful Medina into the suite but we were determined to enjoy Fes itself so we tore ourselves away and promised ourselves to return for longer another day. Breakfast on the roof terrace was lovely and relaxed. Dinner on the terrace was served beautifully and it is a lovely and romantic place to eat; the food was nice enough but very bland by Moroccan standards and lacked the finesse of sophisticated spicing we enjoyed elsewhere. That however did not detract from the over all pleasure of the visit, although next time we will explore the other restaurants of Fes.

 September 2012,5,"Exquisite, elegant and warmly welcoming","Really, what can I say about this riad that hasn't been said already? I LOVED my (3 night) stay at Le Calife and simply cannot recommend it highly enough. It's a breathtakingly beautiful building with wonderful attention to detail in terms of design. However, that would be pretty meaningless if it were not matched by the warmth, friendliness and good-humoured attentiveness of the owners and staff. You really are treated like royalty, but with genuine warmth, care and consideration. The finest food in Fez (in my humble opinion!) is courtesy of Fatima (wish I'd had the time to attend one of the in-house cooking lessons ... next time for sure!).

Its location is simply perfect to explore the Medina and it is also easy to take taxis when needed. The entire space is decorated with extreme good taste. Rooms are very comfortable and offer you everything you might need. Breakfast is served at a terrace overlooking the Medina, a magnificent view. Service is faultless: every single staff member is incredibly helpful and kind and would respond to your requests with a big smile.

 April 2012,5,World Class Comfort in an Old World Riad,"After spending four days in a wonderful riad in Marrakech (Riad Azoulay), our expectations were high for Riad Le Calife and we were not disappointed. Le Calife retains much of its antique charm (woodwork, floor mosaics, architectural details) while offering guests modern comfort (high-quality king-size beds/bedding, spa-like bathrooms, internet). My husband and I stayed in the charming Emerald Suite while our traveling companions (two parents and one adult son) stayed in the palatial Diamond Suite. Both rooms were even more beautiful than the pictures/descriptions, very comfortable, spotlessly clean and quiet (for those sensitive sleepers, you could hear the call to prayer, but it was quite muted).

The food was wonderful at both breakfast and dinner, the staff was terrific and the owners delightful. Riad renovations were done with great attention to detail. We had the Amber room that was conveniently located off of the courtyard and beautifully renovated with a lovely bathroom. While the trek to the rooftop terrace for breakfast was challenging some mornings, the view was worth it.

The stairs were a little narrow and steep for my parents, but the riad itself is beautiful and located near one of the major entrances to the medina making it easy to find. My wife and I were in the Ruby Suite which was absolutely amazing. We had dinner at the riad the first night, a traditional Moroccan meal with salads and tagine. It was very good although way more than the five of us could have ever finished. Alex and his wife were incredibly gracious hosts and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and take care of every little issue, sometimes before we even thought of them.

The staff is very welcoming, the environment is very quiet and comfortable. The rooftop lounging area was an extra special treat. Breakfast on the rooftop was a really nice way to start the day. Breakfast is, as expected, Moroccan, with plenty of selections at your tabletop. The staff were very helpful in making arrangements for us, even going to the trouble to write down directions to and from restaurants we were going to so that a taxi driver would know what we wanted.

As I am an architect, I was thrilled by the stunning, old building, lovingly renovated with colorful Moroccan tiles, wood carvings, metal screens, etc. The rooms are tastefully decorated. And the courtyard is a cool oasis even when the Medina outside is sweltering. We enjoyed the meals (we had two Tajine dinners during our three night stay), the air conditioned rooms, the quick access to the historic center of the city. The only downside that comes to mind is climbing the steep stairs.

The room was delightful and spacious albeit up some seriously steep stairs - this is definitely not a hotel for physically disabled.

We were met by a very friendly porter who carted our luggage to the Riad. The hotel is elegant and tasteful with a wonderful terrace with a great view of the Fez medina.

Good classic food dishes, breakfasts were nice, with some delicious items. The hosts, Alexander and Yasmine, were kind and helpful. We stayed in the Emerald room, which was beautiful and comfortable. For 20 Euros more (at the time we booked), the Diamond room is twice as big and is spectacular. Even though this riad is on the pricey side, if that price structure remains in place, consider splurging for the Diamond Room - it is truly palatial.

Our welcome was genuinely warm and our dinner that night was lovely and substantial. We tackled the medina on our own the next day and returned frazzled and in need of some quiet. Upon the recommendation of Souma (thank you!) we headed up to the roof terrace and some mint tea was brought up.

Extremely polite and caring staff, who will guide you since before your arrival, lots of leisure opportunities offered by the riad. The interiors and the meals are worth mentioning separately. Image yourself a king in your own castle - this is exactly the feeling you will have during your stay. Everything - from ornate ceilings to gentle scents to the soft fabrics is absolutely fascinating. The dinners are served either on the upstairs terrace, or at the dining hall on the ground floor, and the meals are the best examples of Moroccan cuisine in Fes.

 December 2011,5,Highly recommended 10/10,We stayed for three nights and it was a wonderful experience. Fes is much more interesting than Marrakesh from every point of view including the fact that no motorcycles are allowed in the medina. This means that there is none of the danger and pollution that spoil Marrakesh for tourists and the local inhabitants.

 November 2011,5,An Amazing Hotel!,"From the moment one enters the front door of Riad Le Calife it is magical! The air is scented with orange blossom oil, which smells exotic and fresh. Upon entering the courtyard garden of the riad one is struck by the tile work (zellige) on the floor, walls, and columns and the intricately restored plasterwork and enormous carved and polychromed wooden doors. One's eye simply doesn't know where to look first! The plantings are lush and the attention to detail is really astonishing. Inside the public rooms antiques are placed everywhere, gorgeous rugs are underfoot, and Moroccan artwork hangs on the walls. Up on the rooftop is a cozy terrace where one can read a book, have some mint tea (just ask), or take photos of the incredible bowl that is the medina of Fes.

The service was amazing. They set us up with an excellent tour guide, they found us a driver when we needed to get to Erg Chebbi the next day (on short notice!), they had great restaurant recommendations.

We ate dinner in the riad one evening, and Fatima, the award-winning chef, served an exquisite meal.

I was oftentimes teary-eyed at how beautiful the Riad was and how exceptional the level of hospitality was during my 3-night stay. Special mention must go to the lady at the Riad's reception, Mlle. Soumia, for she was always warm and gracious to all the guests. I stayed at the Opaline room which was fabulous for a solo-traveler like myself.

There are little kids everywhere; full of fun and cheekiness. The staff and owners at Le Calife are very helpful and knowledgeable, and will take time to talk with you. My computer wasn't working properly and Alex, the owner, spent hours trying to fix it for me - he eventually succeeded! Our room was spacious and pretty, and the breakfast was good and plentiful.

Soumia was nothing short of outstanding in everything she did. We stayed in the Rubis room (Jewel Suite) which was a home away from home. This was a wonderful room on the top floor next to the breakfast/dining room. There is no need to ever eat out in Fes because you cannot find a better chef than Fatima.

We had booked the Rubis Room which was stunning - large room and large bathroom on the top floor. Breakfast and dinner were served on the patio overlooking the Medina and across to the mountains.

Yasmine and Alexandre, our hosts, are very friendly persons, they gave us lots of advices to visit very interesting places in FES, good adresses for spa, handcraft, etc. They're very nice persons, they make the most to welcome their customers and make them feel at home. The Riad itself is a lovely place, high standard quality for a cheap price, the staff is very kind and helpfull.

Our room was immaculate and we especially loved the tiny fez hats with sweets inside! All staff were extremely welcoming, helpful and gracious.

The rooms are spacious, cosy and decorated with much attention to detail while offering everything a modern upmarket hotel has. We particularly liked the bathroom with its traditional tiles. Breakfast is excellent. There's plenty of opportunity to hang out: After a great meal in the dining room you can go into the patio, take a seat on one of the terraces with their amazing view over the city or let yourself fall into one of the sofas in the bar.

 March 2011,5,Wonderful stay in a wonderful city,"Someone said - If you can only go to a city in Morocco, go to Fes. And although I love Marrakech, this weekend I perfectly understood the meaning of this sentence. No city like Fez embodies so well the spirit of Morocco. And if you are going to FEZ you have to stay in a Riad. Stay at Le Calife. Excellent location, within walking distance of one of the main gates of the Medina. An elegant space, with Arabian decor, but with touches of African and other cultures. We stayed in the suite Rubi, large but cozy, with a diffused light very conducive to romance, but with all the comforts we are used to - air conditioning, heating in the bathroom (large and very well equipped), a huge plasma.

The rooms had all the little extra things that you want when you are traveling, bottled water, nice soaps, shampoos, body wash.

Having been to Morocco before, I was keen to return, but in a more luxurious fashion than backpacking exploits of many years ago. Fes is fascinating, but it was lovely to have somewhere tranquil and friendly in the midst of the medina after a busy day sightseeing; or it might all have got a bit overwhelming. Our hosts were so helpful, and the food was great - after our first night, we agreed there was no point eating elsewhere in the evening. Service wonderful throughout - we were particularly grateful that we were still able to dine after we arrived later than anticipated.

We stayed at the amethyst-room which was very lovely decorated, spacious and clean. Although the hotel was right next to the medina the room was silent and we could have a good night sleep. The hotel itself has a very good restaurant with great maroccan food and a nice bar with internet. If you want to try the maroccan-cuisine you should definately eat at the hotel's restaurant.

Our stay in this Riad was an absolute highlight of our two weeks roundtrip in Morocco in September 2010. Our lovely room and the calm garden was the perfect place for a relaxing break when returning from the fuzz and chaos that characterizes the Fes medina. Further, it was an amazing experience to sit in the roof terrace the evening; listening to the imans calling for prayer and watching the sun set over the roof tops of the medina.

The Riad itself is a feast for the senses, a treasure trove full of objects and antiques and a delight to explore. I still recall waking up to the luxury of the Emerald Suite which was perfect in decor and style and the attention to detail and small luxuries was singularly impressive right down to the chocolates on our pillow hiding in the specially made baby Fes.

Candles are burning, a Jack Russel (Darwin) leaps up to greet you and so does Alexander and his wife Yasmine. Well, they don't leap, but they are glad to see you and then start of tour of the riad.

We stayed in the Opaline room...beautiful and so comfortable. The entire Riad has been lovingly restored. We were exhaused from a long day of driving from Marrakech and even though we hadn't arranged for dinner at the Riad, we arrived hungry. They apologetically presented us with the most beautiful and authentic meal that was so wonderful! They arranged a private guide for us, Hussein, who made Fes come to life for us.

Make sure to take the cooking class wiith Fatima which is a really cool experience and for FREE -unlike other places in Fez where they charge you 600 Dirhams.

Alex is very passionate about the decorations and the selections e.g. small Fez hats with some sweet inside on the pillows, a touch screen alarm clock and a natural soap. The Riad owners Yasmine and Alex were very helpful, so as all staff. What I like about the service is that they are attentive but fully aware to give guests some space and privacy. They have an adorable dog called Darwin – very well behaved. If you are going to stay at this Riad, or any Riad in Fez/ Marrakech, it’s recommended to let a Riad arranges the transfer from airport/ train station.

At the time of booking this was ranked #1 and having stayed in other Riad's in Fez, we would not agree with this ranking. I think most over rated was the service. We would call it average at best and we are pretty simple people so we don't expect over the top service. The few brief interactions that we had with the owners made us feel that we were almost a bother, that they really were not into making guests have a great experience.

The place was spectacular, beautifully decorated by the young husband-wife owners from the upper terraces to the inviting bar. Every bit of it was a delight for the eyes. We booked the ""Rubuis"" (Ruby) room and would recommend everyone do so.

Nice details, like a radio-alarm clock with a good selection of music that comes from a pen drive, a mini bar (not common in most of the riads), or the colorful bathroom, everything made the difference. Another reason for staying there is the hospitality from the owners, Alex and Yasmina, who from the very first moment helped us in every detail.

The view from the roof terrace across the medina will stay with you forever both during the day and at nighttime.

The breakfast that is included was great, especially with the view from the terrace.

Our room overlooked the courtyard and was very tastefully decorated. We liked all the personal touches, books, and of course - Darwin the little dog. Jasmine and Alex were among the best hosts we came across in our 5 weeks of travel through Spain and Morocco - always there to assist and to ensure that all our needs were met.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2010,5,"A wonderful, serene, and beautifully restored riad.","This was one of our favorite places during our 2 wk. visit to Morocco. The charming owners, Alex and Yasmine, did everything they could to ensure we enjoyed our stay in Fez. They have done an excellent job restoring and decorating this riad, with many thoughtful details to comfort while remaining authentic in feel. The roof deck has a wonderful view of the medina which is positively magical at night. We always looked forward to the cool garden and soothing sounds of the fountain after returning from the hot and hectic medina. Breakfasts were generous and served what seems to be traditional Moroccan fare - lots of breads, jams, crepes, juice, dried fruits and eggs. We also had dinner there the first night which was delicious. Pace yourself, they give you way too much food.…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2010,5,The stay of a lifetime,"I wonder if there is any place to stay on the planet as perfect as this small, sumptuous, and charming riad. It is replete with every amenity and charming detail imaginable. The Diamond Room (one of seven gems) was absolutely exquisite and even more spacious than its picture on the riad website. My sister and I could not quit talking about the wonderful hosts and staff. The staff was unfailingly friendly and attentive, yet careful to give us our privacy. If they were in America, I would want them all as friends. The hosts, Alex and Yasmine, gave us a warm reception and helped us with absolutely anything we needed. They even asked one of their staff to accompany us to our medina destination one day because we seemed hopelessly confused with directions!

As you round the corner of the narrow Fes street, knock at a beautiful door, your anticipation mounts and then you are ushered into an amazing environment that has been created to speak to all of your senses. The courtyard is an oasis of fresh air, and charming furniture, appointed with examples of the famous craftsmen of Fes in the mosaic tiles and carved wood. The attention to detail in the interiors is glorious. It is old Fes, mixed with modern conveniences, with a sprinkling of a Parisienne antique store to set the mood. The food is lovely, some of the best meals we had in all of Morocco! The hosts Alexander and Yasmin were gracious and helpful, ready to answer any quesiton.

We were on our honeymoon; so, we splurged for the Diamond Room. As my wife said, it is probably the nicest room we will ever stay in. You feel like you are staying in a palace. They ever arranged hearts with flower pedals on the bed for our arrival. The only thing better than the Riad are the hosts, Yasmine and Alex. They are extremely helpful, and very charming. I also highly recommend having at the Riad at least one night. The food is delicious, but you may want to skip lunch as the portions are generous.

They were phenomenal hosts and it was such a pleasure to be guests in their home. Our plane to Morocco was an hour late; this caused us to miss our train. We missed the high speed train and ended up in Fes two hours late. We emailed Alex and Yasmine to let them know but we were worried that someone would not be at the train station to meet us. We were extremely relieved the find the driver waiting for us at the station. He waited for two hours after Alex and Yasmine informed him that we were still coming on a later train. What a relief! The riad porter then loaded our bags in a cart and lead us to the riad. When we arrived at the riad we were graciously greeted by Alex and Yasmine.

We cannot imagine how you could improve upon the service provided by Alex and Yasmine Lecomte, who I believe are also the proprietors in addition to running the riad themselves. The phrase that comes to mind is that they made us feel like we were guests in their home, but actually it was better than that. They are always ready to help, but have a light touch. It would be more accurate to say we felt like house guests in all of the best ways.

 August 2010,5,The Riad Calife is an absolute gem,"The Riad Calife is an absolute gem (pardon the pun - the rooms are all named after precious stones) in the old old town of Fes. Arriving after a long and very hot train journey from Tanger, we were met at the station by a driver with a carefully printed sign, and driven to a small taxi rank by the Cinema Amar, which became an important landmark for our travels in and around the city. Met there by a member of the Riad's staff, our bags were put into the trolley and we were led off into the Medina, through narrow streets lined with small stalls selling an array of edible goods and general supplies. Cars are not allowed into the Medina, so everything is transported by trolleys pulled by men, or on the backs of donkeys and mules.

We were very pleased with the room which was extremely spacious, light filled, pleasantly airconditioned and relaxing in colour. We very much enjoyed our stay - and special features included the home made jams at breakfast, goat's milk yoghurt, excellent and well priced dinners served with a smile. After long hot days in the medina, the bathtub was much looked forward to and enjoyed. Yasmine and Alexandre were gracious hosts and provided an introduction to the city with map and recommendations.

After walking through few narrows streets (typical in Fes) from the main square next to Cinema Amal, Jasmine introduced us to this stunning place. At a first glance you are simply impressed and only little by little you can appreciate every single detail of the riad. It is very beautiful and elegant, but also a very familiar place. The room was very clean and delightfully furnished (like all the riad). And you cannot miss the magic atmosphere from the terrace (colors and view of Fes) with the muezzin who lead the call to the daily prayers.

But the terrace (in fact there are two, one where meals are served and one for chill out) is simply a wonderful place and the views are stunning. Beyond that, what fascinated us the most is the hospitality and the attention to detail. A library, a small bar, the music - everything is done in style.

The common areas (bar/gameroom, terrace, dining room) are no less, though we didn't use them as much. Both of the hosts were gracious and kind, and made us feel very at home.

The owners are lovely and truly treat you like you are guests of their home, not their hotel. For the add ons, dinner was excellent, I wouldn't miss it. We did a full day tour with the guide they suggested, his name is Hussein - it was worth the money and the next day we felt totally comfortable getting lost in the Medina for a few hours, which may be one of the most fun things we've ever done. Hussein is also very well versed on the history of Fes, politics, etc. You end up going to some shops, but they are all coops, some with great demos, so we didn't mind buying some small things and he didn't care…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes

After researching the reviews on trip advisor the Riad Le Calife had an almost perfect record so we decided to try it. We loved it. Far more personal than a hotel, but you can go to your room and you still have your private time. They gave us directions, they did our laundry and had a breakfast that can only be described as fit for a king. Don't be hesitant to use a Riad in Morocco. The experience far exceeded our expectations. Down side? To get to the Riad Le Calife you have to leave the taxi in a very crowded area and the bellman meets you with a cart.

Yasmine and Alexandre are exceptional hosts, and we miss the warm atmosphere they've created in this place... Riad le Calife is simply, and far away, the best place we've been in Marroco after 6 trips during the past 10 years.

It is situated in the dusty, twisting streets of the crowded medina. (Make sure you get exact directions before you leave home -- we failed to do so, and this contributed to my stressful day).

It´s located right outside of the wall of the old city and all cab drivers know the Cinema el Amal which is nearby landmark. There staff is also very nice.

 September 2009,5,Absolutely Flawless!,"There is little anyone can add to the unanimous praise from other travelers. We stayed 4 nights, including our wedding anniversary, in the Diamond Suite. The riad itself and out room in particular were stunning. Further, the food was wonderful, very important in a city with few dining options. I would, however, appreciate more options for breakfast. This riad is incomparable.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2009,5,"A+ Location, Ammenities, & Caring Ownership","We spent four nights here and were very impressed with the owners, Alex and Yasmine, who run an excellent riad. As hosts, they insure that every expectation is met or exceeded. The property is beautiful and very clean - exceeding what we typically experience in the USA. The location is ideal for exploring the medina, do not be put off trying to find Calife which will be an adventure your first time! The food was very good, and well priced. I think they should try to change their breakfast menu every few days to create some variety. When there, the weather permitted service on their beautiful terrace.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2009,5,a wounderfull place,"We had a wounderfull stay in this charming riad. The rooms are lovely, confortable and clean, the personal is very friendly. We enjoied the deelicious dinner on the roof-top restaurant with a splendid view over the town and last but not least, the very friendly and helpfull young moroccan-french owners of the riad. Dont hesitate in choosing this riad - it's just perfect!",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2009,5,Absolutely perfect Riad,"I would agree with previous reviewees and say that this is one of the best Riads we have stayed in, in Morocco. Yasmin and Alex were fantastic hosts and are always willing to help you or answer questions. The room we stayed in was beautiful and they have renovated it with alot of attention to detail. The food was gorgeous too - its worth trying the evening meal there. I would thoroughly recommend staying at this riad if you are visiting Fes",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2009,5,Surely the nicest Riad in Morocco!,"I was expecting a nice riad from the reviews and pictures that we read/saw before our stay but neither can really do Riad Le Calife justice as it's just beautiful. The rooms are spacious, very well decorated and the attention to detail in the rooms and throughout the riad is just stunning. Yasmine and Alexander are the perfect hosts they have great recommendations for things to do and see, and cannot do enough to accomodate all your needs. We ate in the restaurant the first night, intending to try out other local restaurants for the other nights of our stay, but the food was so good that we ended up eating in the restaurant every night! I cannot recommend this Riad highly enough.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2009,5,just a fantastic stay !!!!,"it was such a wonderful place to stay that when you are leaving you are already thinking about coming again.... The building, the furniture,the terrace, the view....and the best of all the wonderful couple whose pourpouse is just to meke you feel really nice... You can go walking just everywhere from this riad and then, tired of walking .... you will enjoy a tea mint or a beer with one of the best views of Fez! Rooms are spectacular and please .... dont forget to have a dinner here...is really the best!",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2009,5,Breathtaking...Made Fes a Lifechanging Place,"Five stars does not adequately convey how wonderful and magical this riad was. This was my first trip to Morocco and I booked this hotel given other five star reviews. We were met at the square by their friendly porter who whisked our bags away. Once we wound our way hrough the beautiful and vibrant alleys a hidden door opened to the riad. We were led to the check in, where Alex welcomed us right away. Instead of just going over the basics, he made us feel like house guests. We chatted about Paris, Fes, and everything in between. While seated we had mint tea and hot towels offered. After about an hour, (we could have chatted forever) Alex led us to the rooftop terrace. It kills any other view we were able to enjoy in Fes. Alex and Jasmine have picked the perfect…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2009,5,Amazing stay,"We could not have imagined a better stay. Very hospitable, great room, and the service was wonderful. It was our first time in Morocco and we had no idea what to expect, they helped us with everything, including getting picked up at the airport, getting a guide for the Medina, where to eat, and getting a taxi. We stayed at other Riads later in the trip that were nice but this was by far the best. I would recommend this for anyone, but especially if it is your first time the owners are so helpful and full of great recommendations.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2009,5,Pitch perfect in crazy Fes,"Of four stays in riads throughout Morocco, the best was this, our last. It does all the right things--genuinely kind and welcoming service, great facilities including two separate bars, great rooms and a fantastic rooftop terrace with a view of old Fes. Alex and Yasmine were by far the most gracious and genuinely kind hosts we met. Location is outstanding--being outside the maze of the medina but within walking distance to a nearby entrance is highly recommended. The Fes medina is not for the meek, making Marrakech seem like Disneyland. Like our other riad stays, the room had a nice decor of traditional and modern North African themes. What made the difference was both high tech and low tech. The low tech came from collected antiques from Europe. The high tech came from a…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2009,5,Go before it hits the guidebooks,"Simply – this place is great – Since last October (2008) Yasmine and Alexandre (a young Moroccan/French couple who own the place) are creating their own little patch of heaven in a great location, not far from the Bab R'cif. Located up a quiet side alley, Riad Le Calife is a tranquil retreat from the madness of the Fez Medina. The Riad elegantly and effortlessly houses the beautiful and colorful décor of Morocco, with a simple European touch, reflecting the harmony of its owners. The attention to detail, level of thoughtful service and overall quality make Riad Le Calife a place to return to again and again. Make your reservation soon though, because as soon as word gets around, it's going to be tough to get a reservation.",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2009,5,Cannot imagine a more perfect riad,"My husband and I just returned from our Moroccan vacation, where we spent 3 lovely nights at Riad Le Calife. Although we did not want to leave, we were glad to have ended our trip at this riad because, as a previous poster pointed out, Le Calife will definitely spoil you for any other riad or hotel in Morocco. Situated in a more quiet residential area, Le Calife offers a peaceful and luxurious break from the chaos of the medina. Yasmine and Alex could not be more gracious and welcoming hosts, and their hard work in preserving and restoring this beautiful building is apparant everywhere you look. The hotel is relatively easy to find (at least the closest square where vehicles are allowed is) and a phone call to the riad will ensure someone is at the square to show you to…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2009,5,"Beautiful, Relaxing, Great Towels!!!","I had made no hotel plans coming to Fes, and was just hoping to find any place when I got there. Luckily for me, I decided to check tripadvisor for a place, and stumbled upon one of your ""best values."" I read the reviews and was impressed, so based on the reviews I decided to go ahead and book. I was not disappointed, as La Calife was everything I expected and more. After a 7 hour train ride, and finding a petite cab that would take me to R'sif square, this place felt like heaven. In fact, I did not even bother going out to explore Fes that evening and opted to stay in and have dinner on the rooftop terrace. Dinner was great, but the portions were a bit too much for me (I know, I know, nothing to complain about there - but I was suffering from some slight food problems…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2009,5,INCREDIBLE!!!,"I've just come back from Fez, I love the city and I love Riad Le Calife... Their owners are very very nice and they make you feel like in home... If you go to Fez dont hesitate to go to this Riad because I'm sure you will love it... and also have dinner in the terrace because the views are incredible... The rooms are beautiful, all of them, and everything is very clean...Thank you for everything, I'm sure I will come back...

 March 2009,5,Le Riad Le Calife deserves 6 stars,"We just returned from 3 months travelling in Africa. Morocco was our final country destination with a rough plan of spending some time in Fes & Marrakech as well as a week's walking in the Atlas mountains. We stayed for 3 nights at Le Calife & had a wonderful time there. The riad itself is well situated in the old medina; it's at the end of one of the numerous narrow alleys in Fes but don't worry about finding it - just call when you're nearly there & a friendly porter with a trolley will take care of everything. As we came through the front door it became obvious that we'd found something really special. We've since called it a 'palace' or 'something out of a fairy tale'. We learned from Yasmine & Alex, the owners & hosts, that renovation was completed mid 2008 & it's clear…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2009,5,Got it perfect!,"My wife and I live in Marrakech...so staying in a Riad was no longer a novelty...but my in laws were here to visit so we thought we'd give them a taste of Moroccan culture. After 3 years of living in Marrakech and working in the tourism industry, I have seen plenty of Riads and 'botique' hotels. I've stayed in some of the most exclusive boutique riads and in no frills ones too... I must say that Riad Le Calife has just got it perfect! Location wise, it's easy to get to. The owners Yasmine & Alex were just wonderful and very helpful. The staff were all friendly. The rooms were exceptionally clean. The showers great. The rooms spacious. the Internet worked all the time! The food was really delicious...the pastilla was one of the nicest we’ve had...

 February 2009,5,Jewel of the Medina,"This was such an amazing Riad. It was more than I could have expected! Yasmine was such a wonderful host. There was no end to the warmth and hospitality. We traveled with 2 young children and even that was easy at the Riad Le Calife. The food was exquisite, rooms were beautiful, bar and dining area warm and inviting and courtyard a medina oasis.

 February 2009,5,Sumptuous Oasis!,"Le Calife sets the standard for riads! We did not know whether to believe the Trip Advisor reviewer who said that this riad would spoil us for all others but YOU WERE RIGHT! Our stay was top of the line in every way. Breathtakingly beautiful riad, fitted out to the highest standard with great attention to detail while still retaining the warmth, comfort and intimacy of a ""small"" establishment. We had the Diamond Suite, which was huge and stunning. Our married kids were equally thrilled with the Emerald Suite, slightly smaller but still very large and elegant. Nothing was too much trouble for Yasmine, the owner. She made sure the dinner and breakfasts were very plentiful and varied and absolutely to our liking, and she and Alexandre, her husband, have assembled a…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2008,5,Treated like royalty in the heart of the Medina,"Fes was the first major stop on our road trip through Morocco and our stay at Riad Le Calife in the ancient medina was probably our single biggest mistake (PLEASE READ ON! -->). Purely because this was our first experience with staying in a Moroccan Riad and thus the benchmark for the remainder of our Moroccan tour AND nothing came close to being as good as the experience we had at Riad Le Calife. While the prospect of finding them (we drove our own car from London to Morocco!) in the heart of an 'ancient medina' in a city we had never travelled to was a little daunting, this was made as simple as possible with clear directions and we were also greeted on the road side by our host Yasmine and their bellboy with trolley in tow ready to receive the burden of our (family of…",Riad_Le_Calife-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Le_Calife,Fes_Fes_Meknes
