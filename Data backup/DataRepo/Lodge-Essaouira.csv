 April 2022,4,Peaceful retreat near Essaouira,"All Staff were incredibly helpful. The outdoor space was amazing with lots to keep a family entertained - pool, ping pong, yoga. Breakfast was excellent. The apartment was good and clean (though slightly tired) with a small patio. Very peaceful retreat.",Lodge,Essaouira
 December 2022,4,Lovely pool area. Fantastic staff. Rooms differ so pick carefully,"The pool area is very attractive and all the staff are very friendly and helful. The free shuttle is great! Our first room, a standard terrace room was very dark with tiny windows. We also had to move the bed because there was a concrete shelf above the bed at head height which made sittig up in bed impossible and my husband hit his head twice. There was nowhere to plug in the kettle because the router was plugged in to the only socket so we had to use it in the bathroom. The terrace is fine but the walls are so high so there's no view atall and the chairs are uncomfortable so we didn't use the terrace much unfortunately. We moved to a 2 bedroom apartment and this was much nicer, although cost considerably more. It had a little garden terrace and kitchen and was lots more‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira
 October 2022,4,A little bit of Zen!,"Just returned from a yoga retreat with my daughter and friends. What an amazing place. The Shala was beautiful - to practice as the sun was setting is truly magical. The food was delicious, abundant and lovingly prepared by Zakaria. Our vegan/veggie friends were more than happy with what was offered. Staff were great. Had an amazing massage with Hajab. A fabulous experience!",Lodge,Essaouira
 August 2022,2,Pleasant stay but not without issues,"Stayed at Essaouira Lodge in August 2022 having booked it 2 years prior but postponed due to COVID. At the time of original booking we were impressed by the other reviews all saying how flexible the resort was, especially the shuttle service to and from Essaouira. Unfortunately this was not the experience we had - shuttle spots were limited and timetable was inflexible and we very much felt like times were engineered to keep you at the lodge for meal times, alternative being that you would be stuck in Essaouira for minimum of 4 hours. And that was if the shuttle ran on time which it did not. Local taxis are ""not allowed"" to go to the resort so the only alternative are expensive tourist taxis. Food and drinks at Essaouira Lodge was nice but quite expensive, a family of 4 evening‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira
 April 2022,2,SUBSTANDARD!!,"Original concept wonderful. Good location, beautiful buildings, nice outside decor, etc but.... Very dirty rooms. Cockroaches in very high high numbers (more than 30 in our first room and 3 in the next). Poor Hygiene in rooms. Would be careful to eat from the kitchen as well although we enjoied breakfast. Stayed 3 nights. Pool poorly maintained. There are many bugs in the water and you have to ask the staff to clean it. Overall, reminded me of my hay days as a backpacker in Chinese hotels. Not what you expect when on family vacation.",Lodge,Essaouira
 November 2021,5,Day visit with lunch,Had a lovely day here with lunch which was for us only as we seemed to be the only day visitors - food was great and was far too much and great quality They picked us up and dropped us back later we stopped around 6 hours Staff lovely A wellcome bit of pampering Thankyou,Lodge,Essaouira
 November 2021,5,Hidden Gem,"We were so happy to stumble upon the location! We thought we have an adventure and head towards the coast from Marrakech not really planning on staying, but when we found Essaourai, we knew we wanted to spend some time here. We are blessed to pick this beautiful lodge tucked away from the city, with is well manicured gardens and friendly staff. This peaceful retreat was a wonderful escape from the busy city. Clean, comfortable, romantic and serene. Just a word of caution, the driveway in is very long and rough in spots, but be assured, your trip is worth it!",Lodge,Essaouira
 August 2021,4,Stay with family,"The stay was really very nice. We have appreciated the quality of the service either from the front desk team or the restaurant team. At the end of the stay, we have spent 1 hour in the Hammam that was extremely clean and relaxing. Will come back again for sure.",Lodge,Essaouira
 August 2020,5,Romantique,We stayed for 5 days in this beautiful complex. The rooms are very cosy and very clean. There is a big terras and every room has a lot of privecy. The pool is great.

 March 2020,5,Beautiful and peaceful retreat and excellent value for money!,"We loved our stay at the Essaouira Lodge. The location meant it was so peaceful and relaxing, however the free shuttle bus meant we could also enjoy the vibrant and exciting city of Essaouira every day as well. We really enjoyed the buffet lunches with a fresh variety of salads every day which meant it was really easy to still eat healthy. Our suite was lovely and very spacious with a comfortable bed which wasn‚Äôt too hard as I‚Äôve experienced in other places in Morocco. We loved our stay as we also thought it was excellent value for money. The gardens are so beautiful kept and you can tell a lot of time and care is taken to maintain them. We hope to return to Essaouira lodge in the future as it surpassed our expectations.",Lodge,Essaouira
 March 2020,5,"Perfect place to stay near Essaouira, and brilliant value!","This was our third visit to fabulous Essaouira, but the first time we had booked to stay at Essaouira Lodge. The website had looked amazing, the peaceful location outside the town with a free shuttle service sounded ideal, but the prices seemed so very reasonable that we booked for just 5 nights in case we were going to be disappointed. As it turned out we fell in love with this delightful hotel, and stayed another 5 nights! We loved our comfortable, secluded apartment with it`s panoramic view from the terrace, the delightful flower filled gardens and beautiful warm pool, and the buffet style food at every meal was simply delicious and very reasonably priced. The icing on the cake was the exceptional service, especially the excellent Pool House staff and in particular delightful‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira
 January 2020,5,nice place outside Essaouira,"We booked two nights at Essaouira Lodge and really liked this place although you cannot expect the typical Morrocan Riad-style. The lodge is built in a way that you have a lot of separate houses which are connected through lovely gardens and small walkways. You have a main building with a restaurant, a pool-area and a chillout-zone. Also, you have a separate reception area where e. g. you can book a shuttle-bus-service to downtown Essaouira etc. The Lodge is lovely, very clean, very well looked after, with beautiful gardens, excellent traditional food and very friendly staff. It is located a bit outside Essaouira, which is not a problem at all as the Lodge offers a free shuttle-service. All in all we highly recommend this place.",Lodge,Essaouira
 January 2020,5,Divine Oasis,Essaouira lodge is a lovely little gem just outside of Essaouira. The staff were professional and friendly and constantly checked in to make sure our family was enjoying our time. From the yoga to the hammam to the lovely New Years celebration that the staff worked so hard on. The massage from Boucha was also lovely. Thank you for making our stay perfect.,Lodge,Essaouira
 January 2020,5,Just what we wanted,"We travelled as a group of 5 and rented a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house with an independent suite and ensuite for 2 on the floor above. Spacious, simple accomodation with a lovely shaded courtyard and gardens front and back. There is a large public room/lounge and dining kitchen. The Pool House is even prettier than in the photographs and there were always sun loungers and towels to hand. But the highlight of this venue is the courteous, friendly and attentive staff. Jamel, the concierge, provided us a good orientation and was on hand and very ready to help and enquire that we were satisfied.

Jamal also was very helpful! we arrived with a stomachache at the Lodge so we asked him if he could serve us something out of the menu and he took it over! Great spaces, very relaxing and quite place.. I recommend it for more than one night !!

 October 2019,5,5* service,"We have just returned from a 4 night break at Essaouira Lodge, which was very enjoyable. The hotel is located around 30mins from the airport (25euros on way transfer available via hotel) off a well beaten track, it is pretty isolated and around 20 mins drive from the medina. We went for the B&B option, with the breakfast being basic but decent. The staff around the reception are very helpful and make you extras such as omelettes or mint tea at request. We had dinner at the hotel a few times which was again nice and cost around ¬£18 each. The shuttle bus as mentioned before was useful to travel into the medina to get lunch or dinner.

 September 2019,5,Brilliant,"My partner, myself and our 21month old stayed here for 7 nights and I cannot fault it. We stayed in an apartment which was great as we had the freedom to do our own meals and we had plenty of space. But we could also have meals in the main part if we wanted to. The heated pool was so nice and we spent a lot of time hanging around there, most of the time without many others around. It was so relaxing and peaceful. The staff were all super friendly and helpful at all times. My partner and I both had massages which were lovely. And we used the free shuttle bus too which was so smooth and worked well. I really cannot fault this place and would recommend it to anyone at any stage of life, visiting with friends or family.",Lodge,Essaouira
 October 2019,5,Amazing,Beautiful clean apartment with a lovely clean swimming pool and delicious food. Super helpful staff. The free shuttle into town every hour was brilliant. Great location. Really quiet. Could not recommend more.,Lodge,Essaouira
 September 2019,5,8 Days of Bliss,"We were here for a 7-day dance workshop, and stayed an extra day afterwards. I did not want to leave! Our workshop was held in a beautiful tented room during the day and evenings. Jamal and the entire staff were so helpful and accommodating for our group of 32 people from all over the world. He always checked in with us to make sure we were happy and had what we needed. On the property and accommodations: This property is a nice mix of modern minimalism with Moroccan styling. The air conditioning worked great in our villa and had everything we needed to stay comfortable during 90+ degree days, including a private pool at our villa. We moved to a single room for the last night, which had a lovely terrace and seating area. The food was excellently prepared for our group‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira
 August 2019,1,Unrelaxing and rude,"DO NOT STAY HERE if you are expecting a romantic couples retreat. We made the mistake of booking into Essaouira Lodge for 2 nights with the hope of a peaceful, tranquil and relaxing break. We were greeted with the complete opposite, with hundreds of uncontrollable screaming kids splashing in the pool non stop. It was more like a playground than a luxury hotel. Furthermore, management were extremely rude and unwilling to do anything to make our stay more comfortable. Essaouira Lodge is ok for young families, but if you‚Äôre expecting any kind of ‚Äòswitch off‚Äô then your money is better spent elsewhere.",Lodge,Essaouira

 August 2019,5,A lovely quiet haven with superb facilities.,"We stayed in villa 5 as a family of 6. The villa was much bigger than we expected, lots of room for parents and 4 young adults to have their own space. Good facilities. The pool was cold but lovely once you got used to it and it was so quiet. You had no indication you were part of a small complex but you then had the advantage of a 5 minute walk to the large pool, bar and restaurant. Very friendly attentive staff. Food quality really good. Lots of choice and reasonably priced. Hourly shuttle bus to and from the town is a must as you are away from town but I think you get best of both worlds. Beach in town family friendly and also worth a visit. Would definitely return.",Lodge,Essaouira
 July 2019,5,We booked for 8 nights and stayed for 16!!!,"Myself and my wife booked this hotel for 8 nights and ended up extending our booking to 16 nights! The individual villas are built to a really high standard and the whole atmosphere of the place and the gardens and the flowers and plants mean it's incredibly peaceful and relaxing. The swimming pool is a really good size and we spent a lot of time hanging out around the swimming pool and relaxing. The shuttle bus service was excellent, meaning that we could be outside of central Essaouira and going in andIf returning pretty much whenever we wanted. We were extremely happy to be out of the hustle and bustle of the main city. The staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly. It was just a pleasure to stay there! Staying here is the true meaning of affordable luxury!",Lodge,Essaouira
 June 2019,5,Fantastic stay,"This place is wonderful!! So peaceful and with lovely flowers everywhere. I spent a lot of time listening to the wind through the trees.

 June 2019,4,Incredible Value for the price,"When I paid 120‚Ç¨ for two nights with breakfast included, I did not expect such quality. Perfect place to disconnect and refocus on yourself, the staff is friendly and the rooms take you to another era. Could use some little touches in the rooms (equipment, Shower and bath product ) but for the price, it is hard to complain.",Lodge,Essaouira
 May 2019,5,Peace and quiet,"A beautiful place to stay, so relaxing with just the tweet tweet of the birds, surrounded by colorful flowers everywhere.

We love the accommodation. Lovely big rooms. We love being by the pool. The wonderful team are always on hand to make sure you have everything you need. I particularly recommend the freshly squeezed orange juice. All the staff are lovely, genuine people. It is great to be slightly inland at Essaouira lodge and escape the wind by the sea sometimes.

Though located 15 minutes outside of the medina, there is a free shuttle that operates frequently and reliably. This is a lovely small resort with heated (necessary in April) pool, full service restaurant and excellent masseuse on call. Our ‚Äúroom‚Äù was a 3 bedroom, 3 bath villa with kitchen and private pool, also fully serviced each day...for the price of a small hotel room in the US!

Take the stars off for the not so clean interior, under carpets, behind beds or in the shower/bathroom. Lunch / desert was tasty! Friendly staff.",Lodge,Essaouira
 February 2019,5,An oasis of calm and luxury,In all honesty we were so surprised to find accommodation this good in the middle of nowhere - although obviously a posh area judging by the villas round about. It is just out of Essaouira itself (which is a really nice city on the coast) and runs a courtesy bus all day and evenings. The accommodation was spacious and well equipped with lovely sun terraces and cleaned every day. Massive bed. The pool was heated so was warm despite it being early February. The food and drink were excellent and not expensive. Finally the staff were all very pleasant and very helpful. We look forward to another winter break there.,Lodge,Essaouira

We have always loved to take a chance and get lost in the Medina and lottery pick a place to stay but decided something a bit more quiet. We Googled and found Essaouira Lodge; the pictures looked impressive and the resort seemed to lend itself to something a little more authentic than the average jet setter hotel. From the time we arrived to the moment we left we felt catered to by staff and management. The room had attention to detail and was very clean. The hammam was very relaxing and the yoga instructor led us both into a mindful vinyasa session.

Staff is just great and superfriendly, food is good and it is a very respectful environment. If you want to live an experience of Moroccan hospitality and charm, it's the right place. As the lodge is situated on the countryside, it is close to nature and really calm. For me the perfect fit to relax and explore the region.",Lodge,Essaouira
 December 2018,1,Not a great place for families,We stayed one night but did not feel good there. There are two main problems: one is that it is not clean. The toilet leaked and it stank but they came to repair it. The kitchen is not clean and the bed smells. The other problem is keeping a healthy distance between your children and the advances of some of the make staff. It feels quite uncomfortable. The pool area is nice and the breakfast is OK. Food and drinks are reasonably priced but the apartments have seen better days and are too expensive,Lodge,Essaouira
 December 2018,1,Don't stay there with children,"One male member of staff tried to kiss our daughter on the mouth. We managed to intervene just in time. Baffling, however, was the manager's response: ""this is normal in Morocco"". Well, it has not been in the past 30 years that we have been coming here. Other than that the place is well-designed but it isn't clean. This can be an issue when travelling with kids.",Lodge,Essaouira

Even the small varanda outside had tall walls that obliterated any outside view ! Coffee served at breakfast was so bad and cold that I ordered an expresso .

The evening meal (which we had once) was also very good. The reception are super helpful and will make phone calls and bookings for you whenever you need.

 April 2018,3,Not Chic,Good value for 3 star. If you don't want to change your clothes every day this is for you.Kids look miserable and bored stiff. Food is a good value buffet. 20 .euros each. Breakfast good value 5 euros. Free shuttle to town. Iron and hairdryer on request. 1 bottle of water on day one.Coffee machine and kettle but no shop to buy anything. Bed rock hard and I mean HARD. Towels just as hard.Water in shower is hot. You could be in Spain rooms very basic Staff very helpful and pleasant. Surroundings are very pleasant and well looked after.,Lodge,Essaouira
 April 2018,5,Tranquil day trips to the lodge,"My two friends and I were staying in Essaouira but found the Essaouira Lodge offered day trips to their pool with a buffet for 150Dh. It was a fantastic experience and brilliant food for such a small price. We emailed before to confirm and they provided on time and reliable transport from Essaouira to the lodge, free of charge. We enjoyed the day so much that we rebooked it for two days later with treatments. We all booked the hammam package which included a full body massage for 600Dh pp. Money definitely well spent! We all left feeling like new women! Would highly recommend for a day trip and we are contemplating returning to stay at the lodge on our next Essaouira visit! A great way to get away from the hustle and bustle of the town.",Lodge,Essaouira

 April 2018,5,Fantastic place - would highly recommend,"I loved Essaouira Lodge, the staff were friendly, efficient, helpful and generally lovely to the children. The apartment was huge and beautifully set within the forest, meaning we could see thousands of stars. We didn't have a car but the minibus took us down to the town whenever we wanted and always picked us up again. I would definitely recommend staying here and we will be back!",Lodge,Essaouira
 March 2018,3,Not so amazing,"The lodge is very lovely on pictures and in real. However once we got there, it was 20/25 mins to the center by shuttle. Hardly much for children to do other than the pools. Not ideal with children. The walk on the pebble pathway could do with more pebbles as it was long and painful at times wearing sandles. One of the rooms smelled a lot of damp and mould. We did report and they sent someone to clean the room. The villa came with a kitchen that was well equipped for cooking, how ever the kettle was not usable, we did swap it but still very scaled up. There was alot of ants around the house on outside which we did report and some thing was put around to kill them, but unfortunately on our 3rd night in one of the bedrooms and the bed itself had a lot of ants in it.

We had a lovely room with a large terrace. The food was excellent, ended up having the salad bar every night as there was so much to choose from. The free shuttle bus is great for getting into Essaouria, takes 20 mins and you just book it at the reception for when you‚Äôd like to be taken into town. Would definitely recommend this place to stay as a calm oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Essaouria",Lodge,Essaouira
 February 2018,4,Lovely location,"We had a fantastic holiday here as a young family of 4. The hotel is 20 minutes ride away from the colourful and chaotic medina with free shuttle bus rides running several times a day. The hotel is simple but stylish in a peaceful and beautiful country environment. Food buffets were mainly vegetarian and very good choices. It felt authentic too. My youngest daughter was excited to have a new soup every evening as her starter. Heated pool was greatly enjoyed by children. Small splash pool for babies is handy too. We thoroughly enjoyed the Hamam experience as a family. Staff were extremely polite and welcoming, they offered to light a fire for us each evening.

 November 2017,2,Not what we expected,"This is set quite a way out of town they provide transport to the town and back which is a bonus. The rooms were really basic concidering it was a mindful and wellbeing center, we could have been in any hotel room. The pool and bar area was nice and relaxing probably the best bit. We ordered lunch when we arrived and it was a stale buffet not enjoyable just wrapped up and left they do yoga but think you would need to ask",Lodge,Essaouira
 November 2017,5,Beautiful spot to stay,"Such a great and affordable place to stay in Essaouira! The grounds are beautiful, the pool is perfect and the rooms are huge!

Thanks to Jamal, Mekhles, Amine, Abderrahim and the 2 Leila‚Äôs who really looked after me, service is always with a smile. The Lodge is very spacious, the grounds are beautiful and so well looked after. Set in a great location with tortoises wandering around the garden. The free shuttle to Essaouira is an excellent idea although I was always glad to return to the peaceful Lodge, especially for the traditional Moroccan dinner of the day. I stayed in a superior suite and would recommend either SA3 or SA5 as quiet and fab views. The hammam is a must as I had one of the best massages in years from Bushra.

 December 2017,4,Definitely off the beaten track!,"We spent a pleasant, restful week in this calm, quiet resort over the Christmas period. It met the needs of three generations which is quite a feat. Our villa was very spacious and clean. Unfortunately the heating was not adequate as these villas are constructed for much higher temperatures than those of December. We did have a fire lit every night in the lounge and extra heaters were brought in so we warm enough after the first night. Some refurbishment is needed particularly in the showers. Not one of our three showers had fixtures to hold the shower heads. The restaurant was good and catered for all tastes with plenty of gluten free foods.

We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely return back. We made several trips to Medina from the Lodge and driver took us there and back whenever required free of charge. Beautiful resort, would highly recommend. They even allowed us late check out due to delay with return flight.",Lodge,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Fabulous setting,"We stayed in a beautiful private villa ideal for a party of 8 people, with large rooms, kitchen, a lovely shaded courtyard, our own swimming pool and we all had spacious bedrooms each with ensuites showers and toilets. It was lovely and peaceful here a few miles outside the main town of Essaouira. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had breakfast in the main restaurant every day. They do evening meals too. Beautifully cooked. There is a shuttle bus (free) that takes you to the main town every hour.",Lodge,Essaouira
 October 2017,5,Laid back retreat,"Spent a lovely week here with the wife in early October 2017. The vibe is laid back with lazy days spent around the pool and bar area. There were plenty of sunbeds and shade for those who needed it. Bar prices were reasonable (a bottle of local wine was 170dhs) and the service at the outdoor dining area was attentive but not overly so. Breakfast was a relaxed affair, taken every morning in the warm sunshine (buffet style), dinner was available at 100 dhms (buffet) and the evening meal was either 100 dhms for 2 courses or 200 dhms for 3. The 100 dhm option was good value. The rooms were a short walk from the main pool/bar area (maybe up to 200m for some at most).

The only downside is the pool was so crowded that sometimes you couldn't get a bed round the pool.. big shame. The restaurant is very nice and serves a lovely cheap breakfast. The salad bar is great with plenty of veggie options, however its such a shame they do not provide a veggie option in the set menu as you feel you are always missing out and we had to eat out all but one night. However they did do us a veggie tagjne on request. Drinks are expensive at the hotel, but nothing more than you'd pay in a hotel in england. The ground of the hotel are so lovely, utterly beautiful.

 September 2017,5,A Fantastic Find,"We booked for 4 nights, and wished we had stayed for longer, testament to a great holiday. From the minute we arrived we instantly relaxed, it's such a quiet and peaceful location. I truly switched off from the outside world. No TV in the room - perfect, only wifi around the pool - perfect. We had a basic double bedroom, with a terrace, with garden furniture. It was more than adequate for what we paid for it and for what we needed it for. A lovely large bed, lots of storage space, and a huge wardrobe with plenty of hangers! Great walk in shower and his and hers wash basin - a godsend.

I contacted Essaouira Lodge directly, who reiterated that the two-bedroom apartment was most suitable, and the manager kindly gave us a discount as we would only be using the double bed and cot bed.

 September 2017,4,Lovely staff and relaxed atmosphere,"Stayed here for two weeks in September 2017. The hotel is a few miles outside of Essaouira but they do have a courtesy vehicle which you can book for anytime and will drop you off and pick you up at three different locations which is very handy. I found the location not to be a problem as its nice to get away from the hustle and bustle and relax around the lovely pool area. The rooms were cleaned everyday by the very polite maids and the bar staff were also lovely, chatty and very helpful. All in all this is a great place to stay, my only gripe is that there is no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms and the food and drinks are quite expensive compared to down in Essaouira.",Lodge,Essaouira
 August 2017,5,Visit to Essouira August 2017,I visited the Lodge for a week with my 2 adult sons and one of their friends. We were learning to kitesurf and needed a comfortable base.We chose the Lodge because it had a decent pool and more outside space than the hotels in town. It is a short drive inland from the town which means that you are reliant on the shuttle/minibus which is very reliable. We would take the shuttle in twice a day. The fact that the Lodge is several miles in land means that when it was windy by the coast the weather was hotter and calmer at the Lodge for sitting by the pool. I would recommend this place for a longer stay. We had our evening meals in town.,Lodge,Essaouira
 July 2017,4,Extra sun but I worry about peak season,"The staff were really nice and there is a shuttle that runs about every hour into town, but not on the hour or anything like that, it's actually quite random. I feel if it ran on the hour you wouldn't be limited in having to guess the time you will come back. it's definitely worth staying further out because by the coast it is actually very cold, so chilling by the pool you get some of that beautiful Moroccan sun, it is only half an hour out, tops but makes such a difference. If you book any excursions they will come get you and definitely do book some. Surfing was fantastic and quad biking was so much fun. If you don't have kids go with Diana quad, you just hop on and go and get an instagram bestie. We went just before the summer holidays so it wasn't peak season. I worry‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira

 August 2017,4,Fantastic Stay at lovely hotel,"We are a family of four and stayed here for 4 nights in August. The hotel itself is situated about 15kms from Essaouira down an offroad track. There is an excellent shuttle service provided free of charge by the hotel to and from the town. This really is a very good service as without this you would be a bit stuck if you didn't have your own transport. It's also worth knowing that although only 15kms inland from Essaouira it is much hotter at the hotel. Essaouira was high 20's with a cooling see breeze whereas it was high 30's at the hotel with a hot wind.

The kitchen area could be better equipped and we had to borrow a couple of things from the lodge kitchen when we cooked in the apartment. The air conditioning was brilliant and kept us nice and cool. The pool was also very relaxing and the hammam was lovely. It was great having the mini bus which took us to the shopping centre and the medina as and when we needed to go.

 August 2017,5,Great place for relaxing,"As we travelled with children(5,7 years) we looked for a place where we can rest and relax and start exploring the surrounding. And this is the perfect place. It is some 14 km away from Essaouira and located in the ""wilderness"". So use the free taxi to the city or get an rental car. The more than friendly stuff (really, everyone was so gentle that it just felt good being there) arranged a new Dacia for 35 Euros per day. Perfect fit. If you want to do horse riding or whatever they help you to arrange. The pool is great for relaxing and playing with the kids.

Overall we had a wonderful stay and an experience clearly shared by many other visitors having stayed here. The staff are very helpful and do answer queries online in advance of your stay. A. Practical Points: 1. If you have mobility issues, this might not be the best place for you. The loose pebble paving made it very hard for my Mum to get up to the villa. The minibus had no step so we had to lift her in and out. The Pool House & Restaurant was also hard to get around. We have suggested that they look into this, so perhaps worth checking with the hotel if they have made any changes before looking to book. 2. It is quite literally‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira
 July 2017,4,Nice lodge,"We stayed three nights at the lodge in a suite, which is basically a two bedroom apartment. The hotel and pool area are nicely designed and decorated. The staff is friendly and beyond. A few remarks which keep me from giving 5*: - the free towels around the pool are a bit worn down. New towels would be nice and give it some more cachet. - a watercooker would be nice in the apartments - decent and newer cooking wear would also be nice. Pans were deformed so cooking on electric stove takes a long time - two unit Airco's would be more esthetic but the single unit also got the job fairly done. All in all I would certainly recommend this place.",Lodge,Essaouira

I am giving four stars because the staff are so nice but if it was based on the accommodation alone it would be three stars We did have problems with our accommodation when we arrived with a leaking toilet and a shower that did not work properly but when we asked to be moved we were moved to much better accommodation Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend it to others and is very good value. Not sure though why they do not offer small food items from a menu for people who like to stay pool-side instead you have to pay for large meals (which are good) but are not good value when compared to eating out.

 June 2017,5,A beautiful retreat outside Essaouira,"We chose the Essaouira Lodge quite by chance for our four night stay. We weren't certain whether to stay in the town or outside, and are very glad we chose such a beautiful location situated in the middle of argan trees a few miles from the town in the middle of the countryside. We were upgraded when we arrived, and had a lovely apartment with its own private, large roof terrace and sitting room as well as a kitchenette (had we wanted to use it) and bedroom and bathroom. The staff were delightful (it seems unkind to mention only several by name, as they were ALL so helpful and kind!), and could not do enough for us.

It was kept immaculately whilst we were there. The pool area was luxury, beds, towels provided and was never over crowded. Pool is heated to the necessary temperature not to suffer the initial jump in! The staff there are just so lovely.

The place is very well maintained with beautiful gardens, we ended up having dinner at the restaurant every 3 evenings of our stay as the food was really good (though a bit pricey compared to other options in Essaouira). Service was also very friendly and responsive. We stayed in a 3-bedroom villa with our 2 kids, and although you have everything you need, this is closer to a self catering place than a real hotel feeling (only shower gel and shampoo, no other amenities, no extra towels for the private swimming pool).

We expected more for the price and the impression on arrival/online. The food in the restaurant was also very average/bit rubbish and we chose only to eat there once as a result...same menu every day. On the up side, the shuttle into town is brilliant and the staff were pleasant.the kids loved the pool and we found it very relaxing few days.

On arrival the Essaouira Lodge shuttle bus picked us up from the bus station and took us up into a wilderness about 20 minutes from central. What can I say? It was lovely, our one bedroom villa was kept immaculately clean and we had a balcony with a dining table. We wished we had more time to sit out there, but we stayed 3 nights only, and found ourselves mostly poolside or central.

 December 2016,4,"Essaouira Lodge, Essaouira, Morocco","We spent a very nice 10 days in one of the apartments. The staff was always very helpful and charming. Breakfast was superb. The pool was lovely. I think that a regular hourly shuttle into the town would be an asset, as would some updating to the plumbing.",Lodge,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,A place to go back to,"Although quite a distance from town, this place is worth dropping the typical town hotels for. Spacious villas located in a beautiful garden. Tastefully designed to allow a maximum relaxing experience. Delicious food, cooked with pride and served in a splendid scenery. It feels like visiting a family after being away. True home away from home. Very convenient shuttle service will take you to town and back. Free wi-fi may need waiting for a day or so but works perfectly. Be prepared to pay in cash as the card terminal happens to be temperamental.",Lodge,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Relaxing,I was travelling with three friends and we stayed in a two bedroom apartment for three nights. We arrived mid-afternoon and were picked up at the Supratours bus stop following an arrangement I'd made the day before. The lodge was particularly quiet even for low season but this allowed the stay to be very relaxing and peaceful following a busy three nights in the middle of Marrakech's medina. We were also able to use the shuttle bus almost as a private taxi service as there were few other guests. The kitchen facilities were very useful for making our own breakfast using ingredients we'd bought in Essaouira the night before and all the staff that we met were very friendly. The only negative was the slow wifi.,Lodge,Essaouira
 December 2016,5,Escape,"Away from the hustle and bustle of the medina, the lodge is a welcome break for those of us who prefer a bit of peace and quiet and a chance to de-stress after a day in the medina. Set in large, well kept grounds off the road to Essaouira, bird song and sparrows chattering is the most common disruption! In low season it was very quiet at the lodge, with hardly any other guests around to use the main pool. The lodge arranged my transfer from the airport to the hotel, which was welcome after the journey and waiting to get through customs. The friendly, jolly driver Saeed also took me into town and back many times in the week using the freely-provided shuttle service. On check-in Meryam informed me that I had been upgraded to a 'superior' apartment, which was nice. A small‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira

 November 2016,4,Great value stay!,"We booked a 4 night stay in a super suite with terrance and view for some relaxation in the sun after spending 3 days in Marrakech. Due to our own fault we arrived after dark. The check-in was quick and we were shown to our suite with assistance to carry luggage. We were also issued with a small wifi box when I requested the wifi password. The wifi in resort is patchy hence the provision of the wifi booster box. I later found out that this wifi box also works when off site. The suite was quite spacious for two guests with a very comfortable double bed and two comfortable arm chairs for watching television. There were two cupboards in the bedroom, only one being open for guests to use. This had only shelving so no where to hang anything. The other cupboard with hanging‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira

 October 2016,5,Its like Tuscany in Africa...Exquisite!,"I decided to celebrate my birthday in Morocco with a few friends. Essaouira was the second stop on the list. We took a bus over from Marrakech. Once we arrived,we were greeted promptly by the shuttle and taken for a scenic short ride to the lodge. There Miriam greeted us with a warm smile and information on what to do for the next few days. Our last night, we got in a little late and the restaurant was closing, but Thanks to Jamal, they made special arrangements and feed us one of the best meals we have had in Morocco and they surprised me with a delicious cake. I would recommend this place to everyone I know visiting.",Lodge,Essaouira
 September 2016,4,Beautiful and peaceful place to stay,Situated 20 minutes outside Essaouira in the countryside down a bumpy track is this oasis of calm and peace amid beautiful grounds. We stayed in an apartment with kitchen/sitting area/bedroom/bathroom/separate toilet and terrace. I could not fault the accommodation that was comfortable and cleaned daily. Air con would have been a bonus but we finally left the terrace door open to stay cool at night! Noisy neighbours below us one night that chose to have a blazing row was not not the Lodge's fault! Breakfast on the pool terrace daily was lovely and relaxing and the buffet lunch very tasty. Staff were very helpful and accommodating with any request made. Especially helpful were the bar/restaurant staff (yes alcohol is served here!) and the young lady on reception was great‚Ä¶,Lodge,Essaouira

 July 2016,3,"A nice clean, quiet hotel but with a few problems","We stayed in this hotel July 21-29, 2016. We booked a 2BDR home on the suggestion of a staff via email and a second bed to be added to the living room. The second bed never arrived after numerous requests to the staff at the reception and we ended up finally booking the suite above the house instead but had to incur significant additional cost. Had I been aware of the layout of the home and that an additional bed was not available I would have booked a different option at the outset. The booking.com website says that the hotel is air conditioned it is NOT. I asked repeatedly at the front desk reception for a fan but did not receive one until I arrived in my sweaty pyjamas at 10:30 at night. The breakfast area is a den of wasps.

 July 2016,4,Peaceful location,I spent my last day here before the flight home at 7pm. I got a free lift from just outside the Medina to take me to the hotel. I then spent a hours hours by the pool and had a really excellent buffet lunch and a lift back to the Medina later in the afternoon. All for just 150 dirham. An absolute bargain. After the hustle and bustle of downtown it was so nice to have some quite time at this hotel with a lovely pool and pretty gardens. The staff were extremely attentive. The food was excellent. It was all freshly made. I was the only one there!! Every dish was good. I can't comment on the rooms but from what I experienced I recommend this place.,Lodge,Essaouira
 July 2016,5,Exactly what we wanted,"Visited here at the beginning of July. Booked direct on line without problems. Taxi (booked via Lodge) was waiting at the airport and took us directly there. Our room was lovely and as described on website. The pool area was so relaxing and staff were very attentive. The courtesy transport took us into Essaouira virtually anytime we requested and we either arranged our return pick up time there and then or called the hotel when we were ready to return. We were so pleased to be away from the sea front as it was very windy and cool. Breakfast was lovely especially the first few days when it was waiter service, the last few days it changed to a buffet and although it was the same selection personally we prefer waiter service. We ate lunch once and dinner once also, it was lovely‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira

 May 2016,4,comfortable and quiet,"The Lodge is a 15/20 minutes drive from Essaouira, in the countryside, away from the wind... It is very comfortable and quiet. We had booked a huge 3BR villa with its own pool and we loved it. Everybody at the Lodge is super friendly and is trying hard to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We were greeted by Karl who made us feel at home in a fraction of a second and took great care of us! We even had dinner together at Beach and Friends ( super cool beach restaurant in Essaouira) and had a wonderful time. The Lodge is a nice ""oasis"" with friendly and relaxed people.

 March 2016,5,Amazing Lodge @ Essaouira,"Essaouira Lodge is situated About 15 min from Essaouira Medina. You find the Lodge driving by a unpaved Road. It has to be said : it's a very quiet relaxing environment, in the nature and no stress. The staff is very friendly and are open for al your questions ( breakfast , diner, activities) The houses are clean and have a lot of space. The swimming pool is heated and the bar is attractive. We have been here several times , and it's only getting better .... Looking forward to next year !",Lodge,Essaouira
 March 2016,5,Very chilled time at the Lodge with superb service,"Having spent 5 days staying just outside the Medina opposite the beach, we thought we'd retreat to The Lodge with our kids for 2 days and it was a great success. The service was impeccable - they couldn't do enough for us and the food was great. We opted for dinner one evening which was brought to our room - and it was the best food we'd had in Essaouira - apart from the fresh fish by the port. We would definitely go back there and would wholeheartedly recommend. The gardens are also amazing.",Lodge,Essaouira

We only had lunch twice and it was delicious!! We would definitely recommend this place.",Lodge,Essaouira
 February 2016,4,Luxurious and Quiet,"Let me start with the way this lodge has been designed. There are individual buildings that resemble bungalows (except that they're solid concrete), laid out across the hotel grounds. You get the upper floor of the building, which combines a small living room area, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and terrace. It has its degree of luxury and Moroccan charm, without making you feel uncomfortable. The only downside of the room was the lack of heating. Having stayed at the Essaouira Lodge in February, it was freezing cold and the mobile radiator they provide you with, doesn't really manage to warm up the small flat. But as a general rule, I advise you to visit Morocco in the summer months, anyways. Moving on to the staff: all of the employees are very friendly and helpful. Especially a‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira

 December 2015,5,lay back and relax!,"This place is just great! A 1 km dirt road brings you to the lodge and it feels very remote! We booked a villa with a private pool. A big clean house and very well maintained. The breakfast and lunch was good, we didn't have dinner there because there wasn't anything going on. A bit of a shame since the restaurant serves good food. They could have done more with the ambience of the restaurant (prepare the fireplace, light some candles, turn on some music etc). The fact that you have to go out for dinner was (for us) the only disadvantage.",Lodge,Essaouira

 December 2015,2,Poor organisation in the middle of nowhere,"We stayed at the Essaouira Lodge with my family after reading reviews on trip advisor. We were disappointed with the location and the service. We continually had to ask for things to be done, given no information about the lodge and also our room was not cleaned on some days. To add to being in the middle of nowhere we had no wifi access in rooms and also free wifi near bar did not work. The only exception on our stay was the local bar and restraunt staff who tried to make our stay comfortable but were let down by their management by being understaffed. Rooms were good size and decent fit out but we had many spiders in our room and my so complained of stained sheets. There is nothing in the area and no information about activities at the hotel.

Only thing was that the swimming pool is not heated. A thing that needs to be changed. Otherwise service was at level expected for the region. Don't hope for high luxury service... it is a B%B and not an hotel.

Regarding the property, they are individually owned units of a variety of sizes, so we, as a family of four, were able to stay in a two bedroom unit. It was very quiet in late December, and there may have been one other guest. The apartment was relatively well equipped, although cooking a meal in the kitchen would be a challenge, due to a fairly limited assortment of kitchen equipment. We did use the kitchen for coffee and a simple dinner one night.

The big advantage of this place is that the weather stays nice all day and night, no big winds like in essaouira center. The pool is nice and very fresh, tasty food and delicious moroccan breakfast .

The staff is extremely helpful and do their best in making a good experience for their customers. The staff bought bus-tickets for us so we did not have to leave the resort, and on the day of check out we spent the entire afternoon at the pool even though we did not stay the night (we did have a big lunch, though). Overall a very nice escape - and if you are looking for some relaxing days, I would recommend this place instead of a place in Essouira, because this place has not got so much wind. And it's only a 15 minutes drive from Essouira (they have shuttlebusses). Go to Essaouira a day or two, and then go to this place to relax instead of doing it in Essouira. Best recommendations.

The kitchen has all the necessary equipment including the dishwasher and washing machines. The terrace's great for enjoying the sunset and drinking mint tea. Bedrooms provide cozy beds. No complaints about the room service. We used to dine almost every night in the hotel's restaurant. I would recommend to try the Couscous Royal and Tajine with lamb.

We didn't travel with children but there were a large number of children at the resort perhaps as it was the summer holidays but the resort was extremely child friendly. We had a two person apartment which was lovely and clean and had a great big Balcony to sit out on. Two slight problems were that the cooker short circuited the whole apartment so you could only use one small hob and not the larger one and there is no air conditioning which, when the temperature reached 47 degrees during our stay made it uncomfortable to sleep. The hotel owner did however, instantly buy all rooms a fan but that didn't make much difference. The hotel is‚Ä¶",Lodge,Essaouira

 April 2013,5,VIP treatment from the start,"Myself and 3 girlfriends had the most amazing stay in Douar Souiri. We were greeted by Radaoune and his staff when we arrived and we felt so welcome from the very beginning of our stay. We were shown to our beautiful two bedroom apartment and then we came down to the bar for a welcome drink. Our accommodation was spotless and spacious. The decor was beautiful and the beds were large and really comfy. Breakfast was more than we could eat every morning and the staff couldn't have been more attentive. We relaxed by the pool during the day. It was a very peaceful place to hang out. Radaoune introduced us to his wife and children.

We could relax, spend time at the pool and eat nice meals. The manager helped us a great deal, with good tips for dinners and excursions. We rented an appartment with terrace. In general all appartments are new, beautiful and with nice furniture. Only few pitfalls, that for us have not been a problem at all: the distance from the Medina, it's about 10 minutes driving and the last 500 meters of the road are on a offroad route. The SPA was not working during our stay. Overall, we really loved being there and would have loved to stay longer. Maybe next year we will be able to go back",Lodge,Essaouira
 April 2013,5,Essaouira hidden jem,"A beautiful hotel. Fantastically welcoming and friendly staff.....we were upgraded upon arrival free of charge.

It would be perfect for a group of friends.Although it is quite far from the town of Essaouira, on a couple of occasions we got the free transfer down to the town from the hotel on request and the owner went out of his way to fulfill our needs.

Breakfast by the pool is special, delicious, memorable. We will return. You MUST be aware that you're 15km's out of town. But for us, that was the best part.

 December 2012,5,Gorgeous Retreat with wonderful service,"Completely agree with Rachel1372. Our Riad was large and comfortable. Breakfast was freshly made every morning and we LOVED the Moroccan crepes. We did not have a car, but we used the hotel shuttle into the city. When the shuttle was not available, Radouane was very helpful to arrange transportation. He also recommended and arranged nice activities for us like surfing and horseback riding, The entire staff was friendly. One of our favorite employees was Soufiene, our waiter for breakfast and dinner. He even translated the recipe of two of our favorites dishes from the hotel so we can make them at home! I truly believe Essaouira and this hotel are hidden gems. A great value for the money compared to Marrakech!",Lodge,Essaouira

I couldn't find another review on the internet for which to rationalise my choice! Having driven past the residence a few times, we finally found the remote entrance on a dirt path, leading to what seemed to be.... no where. My doubts were building even quicker at this point. 800 meters off of the main highway from Marrakesh to Essaouria, and approximately 15km from the town centre of Essaouira, the Douar Souiri is a true Oasis.
