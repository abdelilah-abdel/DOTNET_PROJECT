 October 2022,4,Nice riad in a nice locality,"The riad is located in a nice locality, very close to the beach and kasbah of the udayas. Riad is nice, room is also nice, the breakfast is also nice. The bathroom is clean and has a electric water heater which is always on, so there is hot water all the time(24 hours)The staff are friendly and hospitable. The stay was comfortable. Overall, nice experience. I recommend this riad.",hotelName,city
 August 2021,5,The Top,I tried many hotel in Rabat unfortunately I didn't feel comfortable but finally i was lucky to find Riad Dar Alzouhor really it was exactly 💯 what I am looking for .. coz early curfew in Corona and stay most of time in the hotel so I need to spend amazing time there.. the staff were very kind and flexible to listen to our suggestions .. Its like you live with your family as well. This review is the least thing I can express my gratitude. لقد جربت العديد من الفنادق في الرباط ، للأسف ، لم أشعر بالراحة ولكن أخيرًا كنت محظوظًا لأنني وجدت دار الزهور حقًا كان ذلك بالضبط 💯 ما أبحث عنه .. حظر التجول المبكر في كورونا والبقاء معظم الوقت في الفندق لذلك أنا بحاجة لقضاء وقت رائع هناك .. كان الموظفون لطفاء للغاية ومرنين لسماع اقتراحاتنا كما لو كنت تعيش مع عائلتك أيضًا. هذه…,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 July 2022,5,BEAUTIFUL PEACEFUL RETREAT IN QUIET MEDINA AREA,"This riad is set in a quiet part of Rabat's medina with white-washed walls and very clean streets. Inside is a traditional riad with a courtyard garden surrounded by rooms for seating and sleeping. The rooms were elegantly furnished, clean with good beds and linen. The shower was excellent and air-con functioned well. Breakfast was a mix of pastries and local dishes with orange juice and coffee all served in the courtyard. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Easy walking distance to the medina, sea front and places to eat.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2022,5,Wonderful lodging in the Medina,"Spent a lovely night in this wonderful spot. The owner/hostess is absolutely delightful, and worked to make sure everything was perfect. She greeted us with mint tea and served a lovely breakfast. If you can, get one if the beautiful tiled rooms just off the central garden.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 April 2022,5,Charming and Restful,"A lovely Riad that is located in a very accessible/central location. It is a welcoming oasis of warmth and hospitality. The courtyard at breakfast is a wonderful way to begin the day with sunshine, plantings and excellently prepared food! It was also our first overnight in Morocco. A lovely beginning to our travels. And after three weeks of travel, it remains very high on the list.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2022,5,Charming Riad,"Dar Zouhour is where we spent our first night in Morocco. It was magical to enter this calm and beautiful space after a long flight and then drive through Casablanca to Rabat. Our room was right off the main ""riad"", which is similar to an atrium, yet it was quiet and very comfortable. The rich decor was authentic Moroccan and absolutely lovely. The breakfast was very tasty. The host was welcoming, kind and helpful. Location was picturesque and convenient. I wish we could have stayed longer.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2022,5,Charming hidden gem in Rabat,"Beautiful decor, clean and very charming Hidden off a central well lit alley in the Medina. Walking distance to the Kasba,beach, market, shops and restaurants Delicious and plentiful breakfast. Owner is friendly, accommodating, and gave us a great supper suggestion!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2021,4,Quiet & calm find,"Very welcoming 8 room riad in midst of Rabat Medina. Very friendly host actually went out to shop for our evening meal which she prepared. Nice meal & wine & beer available (not always possible in Morocco riads). Nice, clean accommodations at fair price. Only slight downside: like many stays in Morocco they try to insist on cash payment at check-out. The card machine is ""not working"" etc...A ploy to not report the transaction or pay the card fee. An ongoing issue all over Morocco. Make sure to clear up this issue when checking in.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2021,5,Amazing calm And Clean Riad in Rabat Medina,"I left a 5 star super fancy hotel in Rabat for this Riad!! If that doesn’t say it all, well this Riad manager by super kind Nora, Imane and Fatima is a super clean piece of calm in the Medina. Very practical to get there as a main road is nearby 2min. Definitely recommend it! And next time in Rabat I know where to book already",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2020,5,Tucked away in the quiet part of the medina,"Ideally located - in the old medina but just far enough away from the hussle of the busier streets. Smart furnishings, pleasant roof terrace, excellent wi-fi, comfortable bed and a good breakfast of bread, pastries, honey, jam and fruit. I'd be happy to stay here again.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2018,4,Friendly warm welcome,Service here was second to none! Friendly family business that went out of their way to ensure we had a pleasant stay.

 December 2018,5,"Cute, simple, great value in the old Medina - would stay again!","This Riad was really cute, simple, great value in the old Medina - would stay again! A short walk to the Kasbah, as well as all of the souks in the Medina. had a basic but tasty breakfast In the lovely lobby too! :)",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat

 April 2018,3,All good until we were told we had to move to another Riad,"We were on a tour with 16 people and after being given refreshments and shown to our rooms which were exactly what you expect from a Riad (very Moroccan, colourful, great mosaics and quite roomy), ourselves an another couple who had also been put upstairs in the really double rooms were told we would have to move to another Riad as other people were coming and had booked our rooms. Hard to understand how this could happen after being shown to the rooms and dragging our bags up the stairs. Eventually we were taken to another Riad at the other end of the laneway and told that we would however have to go back to the original Riad for Dinner and Breakfast. The strange thing was that at Dinner and Breakfast there were only the 16 guests that were on our tour. Neither we nor the…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2018,5,Dar Zouhour,This simple but beautiful and well located riad excels in service. The women who run the riad are warm and consider no question or need unnecessary. Plus they know their city and gave my niece and me excellent advice about must sees in Rabat. They can also call upon a small stable of excellent taxi drivers with fair prices.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2018,5,Perfect place to stay,"This was a great place for a couple of nights in Rabat. It was our first experience of Morocco. The location just inside the medina makes it easy to find amd then to navigate the rest of the medina. It is quiet and very clean with lovely roof terraces and traditional courtyard. The staff, particularly, Asia, were extremely helpful and charming. We would recommend this Riad.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2018,4,Well located in the Medina,"We travelled with a group of 16 and stayed here one night. We also had an evening meal here as a group. Drinks were quite expensive. We were the only occupants of the Dar. Breakfast was a basic Moroccan fare, but there was ample food for the group, which was replenished as required. As with most Dars and Riads, the rooms vary in size and arrangements. We had a room up one flight of stairs. It was a large double room and was well furnished with a reverse cycle air conditioner. The bathroom was large with shower etc., but we only managed to get a trickle of hot water in the morning. Others in the group had no problems with hot water. The room was clean. The staff were friendly and pleased to provide mint tea for a group of 6 after our walk through the souks. There were restaurants…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2018,4,Great Riad,"This was our first stop in Morocco and when we arrived it was a pleasant surprise, we were a bit annoyed that we had to climb many stairs with our suitcases, however when we reached the top our room was amazing, it had it's own sitting room and was beautifully decorated, we went downstairs to meet our group and after approx 20 min's we were told we had to move to another Riad as the room we were shown was already booked, so we went up stairs and brought our bags down and then the staff wheeled them down to the other Riad, this was very annoying as we were not with our tour group and we had to walk back to Dar Zouhour Riad for our Dinner and Breakfast, fair enough it wasn't a long walk but it should never have happened, the staff were very appologetic and nice about the mix up,…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2018,3,nothing stands out,"Our tour company booked us one night at this place. After stayed at two outstanding Riads in Marrakesh and Fez, we were a little disappointed. it feels a budget hotel. Honestly it was a very average riad though nothing went wrong. Diner and breakfast are ok.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2018,5,highly recommend!,"It is a hotel that managed pretty well. All rooms are decorated with charming details. It is located in a quite neighborhood in the Medina of Rabat, just few minutes walking distance to local market. The staff is nice and hospitality, upgrade our room upon our request at their convenience.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2018,5,Excellent Riad,"Cute and charming Riad. My fiance and I spent 3 nights at Dar Zouhour. We found it to be well kept and in close proximity to the Kasbah (5-7 minute walk). Located in the medina, we thought it was going to be noisy however, it turned out to be a quiet getaway from the hustle and bustle on the main strip. The staff was excellent especially Nora who went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and memorable. We would highly recommend this Riad!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2017,4,Nice and quiet getaway,"Rooms downstairs are beautiful, with amazing Moroccan details, rooms upstairs have a more basic design but are more quiet because of breakfast downstairs. The breakfast was really nice with fresh eggs, juice, coffee, tea, local delights, yoghurt etc. Nice atmospheric terrace inside and upstairs if you like. The staff is really helpfull, friendly and we could easily store our luggage during our last day. We slept very well, it is a quiet place at the edge of the medina!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2017,3,Charming and Nice Riad,"Dar Zouhour is a very good standard riad. It is well restored and the rooms have very good bathrooms and comfortable facilities, During my visit the light above the small desk did not work and was not fixed which made doing any work difficult. The breakfasts in the courtyard were good. It is located at the coast side of the medina of Rabat.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2017,4,"Beautiful, a bit hard to find","Really nice quant riad hidden away in a quiet neighborhood. It’s a bit hard to find so be sure to call ahead and have someone meet you out on the main road to avid lugging your luggage up and down the alleyways. Service is friendly and helpful and breakfast was good. TV, AC, and free WIFI.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Typical Riad in the Medina of Rabat,Wounderful Riad with closly indoor place and terrace on the top with view over the medina; historically and well equiped rooms for tourists on 3 floors; perfect morrocan breakfast; Close to the historical places of the town,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2017,4,Lovely and perfectly located,"A lovely clean Riad perfectly located, in the medina. Like a lot of Riads, when you get to the door you're not sure what to expect. This little Riad was lovely inside and the owners were very helpful whenever we needed anything. It's a short walk to the kasbah, and near some lovely little restaurants. The restaurants can be hard to find... but they're there! Sleep quality was great. It was lovely and quiet.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2017,5,Highly recommended,"This is a very nice and clean Riad in the Medina of Rabat. Each room is named by a flower and the entrance door has this flower painted on it. The room has a nice size and, like every corner of the Riad, is clean. The staff is very friendly, helpful and speaks pretty good english",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 July 2017,5,Perfect place to stay in Rabat,"I stayed in this lovely riad for my 3-week business trip, and it was absolutely a relief to come home here from the hectic working days. The place is beautifully Morocco-authentic, always clean, with a cosy terrace to chill out in the evening or during the day. Suites are the most comfortable with a lot of space. Staff is very kind and friendly, the ladies are there for you anytime. Very good breakfast. Excellent choice!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2017,4,An authentic stay in a traditional Moroccan hotel,"The support staff made the difference in every way. From checking in at 2:00 AM to check out a week later, the staff went above and beyond in accomodating our requests. The hotel location was at first disconcerting however finding our way around made that concern go away real quick. The room was clean and very comfy. Breakfast was delightful. Steps leading up to the second floor are steep and challenging however we got used to them. All in all a very good experience at Dar Zouhour.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 April 2017,4,A pleasant surprise.,"We arrived at the Riad after a long flight from Australia. We were made welcome and given a cup of mint tea. The room we had was large and the aminities great. Local maps were provided for us. Dinner was genourous and the breakfast fresh, nutrous and satisfying.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2017,4,Centrally located,We recently spent 3 nights in this Riad and the staff and location suited our needs. 5 mins from the markets and close to restaurants this was a good choice organised by our tour company. My only criticism is the hard mattresses and the omelette for breakfast just wasn't quite up there. Good value and central location.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2017,4,A wonderful surprise,"Located in the medina, this Riad was a wonderful surprise. This is not the place to stay of you want modern, pristine accommodation. This is where you come to stay so that you will feel you are in Morocco. The staff were helpful and focussed, our room was spacious and delightfully furnished, the bed was comfortable and the en-suite , while a little tight, offered all that was necessary. The ambience of Riad Dar Zouhour with its beautiful tiling and colours got us away to a great start on our tour of Morocco. I would highly recommend the place.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2017,4,Friendly Staff and Nice Decoration,"The Riad is located in the medina, at walking distance from the Kasbah and the Hassan Tower. The staff was very friendly. The room was nicely decorated and calm, a bit cold (visited in February). The breakfast was good.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2016,5,Lovely riad,"Hidden away in the old city, this is a very comfortable place to stay. We stayed here for 3 nights. The riad is in a quiet area, and less than a 5 minute walk from a number of attractions and markets. The staff are excellent and accommodating. Our stay had breakfast included.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2016,3,Pleasant stay in a good road,On arrival as usual in a road you have no idea from the outside what the inside will be like. This was attractive but our stay was slightly let down by the bedding which could have been off better quality. The pillows were not great. However the show was excellent and breakfast was OK,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2016,5,Lovely Riad,"Delightful and charming Riad in Rabat. Welcomed by Noura and the friendly staff. Very warm and homely place. We stayed in Ibiscus room which was clean and inviting, but a bit small especially with baggage. Walking distance to shopping area. Would highly recommend Dar Zouhour.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2016,4,Friendly and helpful staff,"Very comfortable riad near the ocean and kasbah. The staff were very accommodating and helpful. Note, though: If you wish to have dinner, order it at breakfast the day of (we got our wires crossed thinking we had done so the night we arrived for the following night, but evidently we needed to do so at breakfast). They do have beer and wine -- a nice touch for us westerners.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2016,4,Quaint Nice Raid,Very pretty and great staff. The food was good but the portions were not as large as the other raids I have stayed in. My room was beautifully appointed and clean. The only issue I had is that my room was steps from the garden area where the meals were served and people gathered and it was very noisy if you are trying to sleep. Recommended but ask for a second floor room.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2016,5,Dar Zouhour is amazing!,"Nora was very communicative with me prior to the trip there, and answered all of my questions immediately. Our room was large, comfortable, with plenty of space for walking about, stowing clothes and suitcases. The bathroom was large, with faucet, shower and toilet all operating perfectly. The atrium was a sheer delight in which to eat breakfasts and drink tea/coffee throughout the day. The provided breakfasts were bountiful and tasty, providing us with much needed energy in the mornings to be able to negotiate the souks and explore the palaces. Nora and her staff were always present to provide wonderful service - the best - and were always friendly. I would stay here again next time in Rabat!!!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 April 2016,3,"Simple, but nice riad","We stayed two nights in this riad. The location is excellent (in the medina), which also means that a car cannot park in front of the door. The rooms are OK, a bit weary, but sufficient. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast is typical Moroccan: Moroccan pancakes, fruit, but enough. The inner yard is surrounded by rooms on the ground (and first) floor, which means that people in the rooms rightfully presume that people in the inner yard can hear what they say/do and vice versa. The hotel does not serve lunch or dinner, but is fortunately about 100-200 meter away from one of the best restaurants in Rabat (Dinarjat), so ask the hotel staff to point you in the right direction (even with google maps it is daunting to find).",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Return to Dar Zouhour,"I recently made another trip to Rabat and chose to stay at Dar Zouhour again. I was not disappointed. It was wonderful to return to the peaceful, welcoming environment of this Riyad. The staff does its best to make guests feel at home. The breakfast is filling and excellent and dinner is available on request. Nora and her staff can also help arrange transportation to other cities or to/from the hotel. The location is excellent.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2016,4,A lovely surprise behind the walls!,"As a first-time visitor to Morocco wanting to avoid American-style hotels and get a cozier and more informal feel for the place, I was delighted to discover the lovely interior of this riad inside the medina. The location is perfect - easy walking to the beach, the Kasbah, the souq in the old medina and a bank. Nora was very friendly and helpful - she even bought a small box of coffee for my friend who asked about it at breakfast (which was delicious and served on time). The rooftop terrace was pleasant and quiet - a nice spot to relax after a trans-Atlantic flight. A word of advice - sound travels via the central courtyard inside most riads, so bring along some good earplugs if you're a light sleeper. I would be happy to stay here again!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 April 2016,5,Beautiful riad in the old town,"Beautiful hotel in the old town of Rabat. All rooms (8 in total) are furnished in a typical moroccan style and the employeers are very friendly and always helpful. I prefer a room to the back side of the hotel, because in front of the hotel kids sometimes play football during the day which may a little loud if the windows should be opened. Alltogether a real nice place far away from the noisy downtown.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2016,5,Very friendly relexing environment,"We had a very good time. Wonderful food (breakfast and dinner), very clean rooms with comfortable bed, so you can get a good night sleep. Although in the Medina the rooms are very quite and the top roof tarrace a nice place to relax during the day. The staff is the most friendly of all. Coming back from a day exploring Rabat and it's environment it is the perfect place. We had one of the suites at the ground floor. Very nice Marrocan style rooms. The breakfast area is just in front of the room. Was not a problem at all for us, but at high season it may become noice. Would not hold be back from going back !!!!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2016,5,Lovely Riad in the Old Medina with Superb Service,"Dar Zouhour is an unpretentious, lovely little Riad in the old medina of Rabat. It is in a prime location; just a short walk to the Kasbah, the beach, and to the souq in the old medina. The staff was very accommodating, especially considering we booked very last minute. Each room is colorful, comfortable and unique, and there is also a pleasant rooftop terrace. There was a small plumbing issue in the first room we stayed in, but this was quickly seen to and we were moved to a different room immediately. A nice breakfast is served in the central dining area in the mornings as well. The best part of this place, however, is the service. Shayma and Nora were both extremely helpful, accommodating and pleasures to talk to, and made us feel very welcome!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2015,3,"Comfortable, Clean & Colorful","This little riad in the medina of Rabat was our first stop on a 14 day tour of Morocco. We landed in Casablanca and drove to Rabat. We were ready for sleep and didn't explore the city at all that day. We did find the staff friendly and were able to communicate enough to find our way to breakfast on time. The rooms were pretty, though we found much prettier later on the trip. None of us were unhappy with anything so that merits a strong three star rating. If I had reviewed it directly after the stay I may have leaned toward a 4 star rating as I found it colorful and very pretty -- but then I saw the rest of our accommodations in the country.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 January 2016,1,Tried to extort us,"I found this place on a booking website for a great price, 3 people on a suit for 102$ the 2 nights we were planing to stay. Then I called them to confirm with the hotel, but they said that couldn't be right, the price is 97€ per night. After some negotiation they agreed to offer the room for 500 something dirham per night. But then, when we finally arrived past midnight after a long road-trip, they informed us that it wasn't possible to have that price anymore! we needed to pay 300Dh extra for a suppletory bed (if this is not extortion, then you tell me). Fortunately I knew a great affordable hotel a couple blocks away (Hotel Darna) that was happy to receive us and had a roo for 3 people with breakfast included for 650Dh/night. Shame on youDar Zouhour, this is the real spirit…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 January 2016,2,Dar Zouhour,"I met one member of staff only on my stay. She was helpful but didn't speak a word of English. I complained on the first night about the smell in my room and asked for another room the second night. The second room had exactly the same smell. I couldn't find what was causing the chemical smell which affected my nose and throat and, I think, gave me a terrible cough. I seemed like the room had been soaked in some sort of fresh air 'Airwick' and everything including bedclothes reeked of this smell. The price was absolutely outrageous for this property. Way overpriced. I travelled to six places in Morocco and this was the worst I experienced.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2015,5,Comfortable stay in the Rabat Medina,"Lovely riad in the medina of Rabat. Its located close to boulevard Mohammed V, which runs right through the medina and the center of town. Its also an easy walk to the ocean and the kasbah. Breakfast is good. The room was very comfortable with a good bed and bathroom facilities. The staff were also very nice. I would definitely stay here again.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2015,3,The price is not right,"The staff is friendly however the owner is not up to par. The architecture is interesting but the added cheap features, such as craft material or terribly cheap paintings hanging on the walls should be given away. Breakfast is good but coffee should be served not stored in a thermos bottle. Rooms are small but convenient, bathrooms are clean. If the price was reduced by at least 25% I would rate it 4 stars, but at that price I expect more.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2015,4,brilliant breakfast,"lovely quiet riad in the medina, helpful staff, comfortable clean room and an excellent breakfast with freshly squeezed juice and pancakes, honey , fig jam and fruit etc.reasonably priced . My only minor criticism would be that when I asked for a restaurant recommendation I was guided to a place with a fixed price menu- although quality was excellent it was more than I wanted or needed...",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2015,5,Small pleasant hotel right in the middle of the medina,"This is a very nice small local hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff (they speak English). The hotel is an old riad and is right in middle of the medina, close to the buzzling Ave Mohammad and to the many small colorful streets in the medina. There are many good kebab-type of places in the medina. The hotel is also close to the beach, the kasbah, the closeby city Sale (by rowing boat) and the modern neighbourhoods of Rabat. One can easily walk to most places. Our room was quite and clean, and very dark at night. The breakfast was varied and included several traditional things - a nice treat.

The staff was very helpful and assisted us to a nearby restaurant with…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2015,5,"Excellent, peaceful, welcoming. This is a perfect place to stay in the Medina.","I stayed for just over a week and loved every minute of it. The riad is well situated Though you do have to walk from main street to the riad which takes about 3 minutes. This is what you'll have to do with any riad in the medina, so this one is no exception. The reception and service are excellent. The rooms are clean, spacious, and very well taken care of. Noura and Shama and the other staff did everything possible to make sure my stay would be a comfortable one. The breakfast is excellent. You do have to notify them in advance if you want to have dinner there, and they will make it fresh for you. I prefer this experience to staying in any of the large hotels in Morocco. I would definitely return to stay here.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2015,5,All you want from a Riad,"Our room on the 1st floor is clean, functional and spacious enough for our 3 night stay. Staff are friendly and helpful and breakfast is more than sufficient to set us up for the day. Great location for exploring the medina and Kasbah.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2015,4,"Well situated, but difficult to find","A beautiful riad, within the medina. Therefore not easy to find, but once you are inside: beautiful. Correct reception, fine breakfast, nice soacy room. The royal palace is around the corner, as is the market. If you drive your own car: drive the Avenue Mohamed V to its end (there starts the sauare of the palace); call one of the oarking guys, pay him and ask if he can arrange somebody to bring your luggage and you in the medina and to the hotel. No hassle, and it will coast you next to nothing.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2015,5,Nice riad close to Rabat Medina,"Close to the Medina, not far from the main road, clean, beautiful decor, good food and hospitable and helpful owner. We like the code door system allowing us to get in/out freely without disturbing the owner.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 July 2015,5,"Best Place In Old Town, But... !!","I've been there for one day visit ,staff really helpful.

 July 2015,5,Great escape,"Beautifully decorated riad with incredible attention to detail in every aspect. The hostess was really friendly and made us feel at home. She was available at all times, day or night. She gave us the information and guidance needed about Rabat such as places to visit and restaurants. She was a person that really cared about our satisfaction. The riad is very well situated and everything is in a walking distance, the medina, Oudaia, Kasbah, the beach. The riad has everything you may need, food, drinks, Hammam, Wifi… The room was nicely decorated with air-conditioning and a really comfortable bed. My room's name was ""Warda""!!!!!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2015,5,"Charming property in a lovely, walkable, quiet, neighborhood","I absolutely loved my time at Dar Zouhour. Check-in was incredibly easy--staff speak French, English, and Arabic. After check in, I sat up on the rooftop terrace and the staff brought me mint tea and pastries--a great way to de-tense after arrival. The space was incredibly peaceful after a hectic day exploring the souqs and I really appreciated the staff's attentiveness. Room was comfortable--big bed, AC, lovely wardrobe and light fixtures. Huge shower, which was a nice plus, as were the swanky local shampoos. Was very pleased with the breakfast options the next morning--crepes, pastries, omlettes, honey, jam, cereal, fruit, etc..

The staff was very helpful and assisted us to a nearby restaurant with…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2015,5,"Excellent, peaceful, welcoming. This is a perfect place to stay in the Medina.","I stayed for just over a week and loved every minute of it. The riad is well situated Though you do have to walk from main street to the riad which takes about 3 minutes. This is what you'll have to do with any riad in the medina, so this one is no exception. The reception and service are excellent. The rooms are clean, spacious, and very well taken care of. Noura and Shama and the other staff did everything possible to make sure my stay would be a comfortable one. The breakfast is excellent. You do have to notify them in advance if you want to have dinner there, and they will make it fresh for you. I prefer this experience to staying in any of the large hotels in Morocco. I would definitely return to stay here.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2015,5,All you want from a Riad,"Our room on the 1st floor is clean, functional and spacious enough for our 3 night stay. Staff are friendly and helpful and breakfast is more than sufficient to set us up for the day. Great location for exploring the medina and Kasbah.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2015,4,"Well situated, but difficult to find","A beautiful riad, within the medina. Therefore not easy to find, but once you are inside: beautiful. Correct reception, fine breakfast, nice soacy room. The royal palace is around the corner, as is the market. If you drive your own car: drive the Avenue Mohamed V to its end (there starts the sauare of the palace); call one of the oarking guys, pay him and ask if he can arrange somebody to bring your luggage and you in the medina and to the hotel. No hassle, and it will coast you next to nothing.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2015,5,Nice riad close to Rabat Medina,"Close to the Medina, not far from the main road, clean, beautiful decor, good food and hospitable and helpful owner. We like the code door system allowing us to get in/out freely without disturbing the owner.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 July 2015,5,"Best Place In Old Town, But... !!","I've been there for one day visit ,staff really helpful. Clean place, organized ,you feel like in your own house ,quiet, everything is awesome, except the prices for the bigger rooms, hope the owner will understand that .If the prices were a little bit lower we would then extend our stay .",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 July 2015,5,Great escape,"Beautifully decorated riad with incredible attention to detail in every aspect. The hostess was really friendly and made us feel at home. She was available at all times, day or night. She gave us the information and guidance needed about Rabat such as places to visit and restaurants. She was a person that really cared about our satisfaction. The riad is very well situated and everything is in a walking distance, the medina, Oudaia, Kasbah, the beach. The riad has everything you may need, food, drinks, Hammam, Wifi… The room was nicely decorated with air-conditioning and a really comfortable bed. My room's name was ""Warda""!!!!!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2015,5,"Charming property in a lovely, walkable, quiet, neighborhood","I absolutely loved my time at Dar Zouhour. Check-in was incredibly easy--staff speak French, English, and Arabic. After check in, I sat up on the rooftop terrace and the staff brought me mint tea and pastries--a great way to de-tense after arrival. The space was incredibly peaceful after a hectic day exploring the souqs and I really appreciated the staff's attentiveness. Room was comfortable--big bed, AC, lovely wardrobe and light fixtures. Huge shower, which was a nice plus, as were the swanky local shampoos. Was very pleased with the breakfast options the next morning--crepes, pastries, omlettes, honey, jam, cereal, fruit, etc.. Wifi was good enough for Skype. As a single, female traveler, I felt perfectly safe in the neighborhood, even walking back alone at night from where…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 April 2015,1,Moroccan wedding next door - very effective at keeping you up till midnight,"I don't know how often this happens. I don't see any other reviewers mentioning it, but it was like we were at the wedding. Blasting, I mean blasting, music till almost midnight. No chance of getting a good night's sleep before 12 hours of travel the next day. No refund, no attempt to help find other accommodations. Just sit there with your 4 year old till midnight and enjoy the traditional blasting Moroccan music. Also, the help speaks very little English, further complicating matters. Congratulations on your 1 star Dar Zouhour, you earned it.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2015,5,Experiencing authentic Moroccan hospitality in Rabat,"My first visit to Riad Dar Zouhour was booked because in February 2015, I needed one night’s accommodation before moving to one of the big Rabat hotels to meet a group embarking on a tour of the entire country. I’ve been to Morocco many times, stayed in many hotels, and dined in many restaurants located in riads. But this was my first night in a small, intimate, riad boutique hotel, and within minutes of arriving at Dar Zouhour I began having regrets: I regretted not having allowed for more than one night there, and I regretted not having my wife with me for such a wonderful experience. The approach to the entrance of Riad Dar Zouhour is exactly as it should be for an authentic Moroccan experience. One leaves the streets and traffic for a short walk through quiet, narrow…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 January 2015,4,Very nice and central place,"We spent tow nights there and except for smell of cigarettes a very good place to stay. Especially if you want to be located near the center of the tourist attractions (Suq, Kasbah, Beach....). Important maybe to mention if you travel with a car that you can't access the hotel directly, but only by foot as it is in the old part of the city. Although parking (guarded) is close by and not expesive. The only thing as a family we really did not like is that you are allowed to smoke in the hotel.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2014,3,lack of security,"We stayed there with a group of ten people between the 24 and 31 december, the riad is well located and very clean unfortunatly we realised that a lots of our clothes were stolen during our holidays. We had to send several E-mail and threat them to call to cops to receive an E-mail to inform us that our clothes were miraculously found in a closet. We never received a coherent explanation by the owner....",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2014,3,Pure Moroccoan,"This charming Riad is in the old Medina. It is about 100 plus years old and has some historic detail. The tiles and wood carved doors are wonderful. I""ve never stayed in a Riad in Morocco so this was new. The doors don""t have keys. The bathroom and bedroom were clean and they rearranged our room to suit us. Free Wifi and breakfast which is more European in flavor than American. Staff is very friendly and helpful.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2014,5,Set a high standard,"This was my first trip to Morocco and I arrived in Rabat with my friend, completely unaware of what to expect. Our stay at Dar Zohour was absolutely wonderful. The room was small but tastefully decorated and well-maintained. The building is beautiful, with a large central courtyard.The wifi always seemed to work well, and breakfast was good. The staff was very kind and helped us find places to explore in Rabat. The location is excellent and relatively easy to find once you know where it is, although at first we found ourselves lost in the medina. We were close to many tourist attractions and restaurants as well as shopping; Rabat in general is a very walkable city!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2014,3,Just ok,"Firstly the riad has an excellent location and beautiful architecture. The service was nice but I would not stay here again or recommend this riad to anyone I know. We stayed 4 days in this riad. While breakfast was normally acceptable we were served old stale bread a number of times and cold deep-fried bread with processed american cheese one day. Additionally, for the price of the hotel (fairly expensive by Moroccan standards) they chose to charge us for the bottled water in our room. The water wasn't expensive but it felt a little cheap. Lastly, the room we had (on the second floor) was VERY small and we had to keep out suitcases in the bathroom. I think you can probably get better value for money elsewhere with friendlier service.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2014,5,Cozy riad in the heart of the residental medina,"Riad Dar Zouhour is a cozy riad in the back streets of the residential medina in Rabat. More lively commercial parts of the medina are 5 - 10 minutes walk, although in the residential area there are still children playing in the alleys and parents drinking tea in their doorways. Arriving in the evening after the sun went down, a friendly local resident showed me where the riad was located, saying the media is ""one big family"". I definitely go the same impression watching the locals interact in the well-lit medina streets. Dar Zouhour itself is a beautiful oasis inside the medina. Typical Moroccan architecture, a nice seating area, as well as a roof terrace make it a special place. Rooms were clean, wifi was good, and breakfast was wonderful. I'd stay again without a second…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2014,4,A delightful experience,"Here completely by accident, and it set a high standard for the rest of the trip, great bed, the best breakfast and really friendly staff, many thanks. The decorations are tasteful without being overwhelming, and the roof terrace is charming. The wifi worked really well, also setting a high standard.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 July 2014,4,"Friendly, efficient staff","We drove to Rabat during Ramadan. We use our GPS to find the street but beware of parking attendants. Park at the end of the street furthest from the kasbah, (after the pharmacie) it's cheaper. Alan's staff made us feel very welcome. The room we were upgraded to was very spacious and had a great shower and comfortable bed. English speaking TV channels too. Breakfast was very good, with plenty of food to sustain us during our day out. Food could be bought at some stalls in the medina and taken back to the riad. We found some restaurants around the medina to eat at after 7.45pm prayer. Thanks Soufiane and Noura for looking after us.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2014,5,Set the Bar for Our Trip,"This was our first Riad after a long long day of traveling from the states, to Amsterdam, then to Casablanca, back to the airport to fetch a friend who'd missed her flight, then to a long ride to Rabat. We arrived much later than scheduled, and we were greeted by the handsome Soffion (sp). It was a beautifully decorated in authentic Moroccan motifs. He showed us our rooms, and as we were discussing an angry woman started banging on the window of a room off the courtyard. We then went to our rooms, which were cozy and comfortable. After traveling for almost 24 hours, a shower was in order. This was our first introduction to Moroccan hot water. That is one of the perks. Now it was close to midnight, and we went down for dinner. I wasn't really hungry, but out of respect for what…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2014,4,Reasonable lodging in Rabat with excellent shower,"The rooms and service were fairly average based on our experience in Morocco, with special commendation for the décor and the best bathroom facility we experienced during our visit. The breakfast was standard mix of breads, beverages and an egg omelet. The location was excellent for exploring Rabat with easy access to main avenues and the beachfront was only a few blocks away. While not the most elaborately decorated place we stayed during the visit, it was a fine place to rest the head during the visit to Rabat, and recommend this as an option for you to consider when planning your visit.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 April 2014,4,A wonderful Moroccan experience!,"The setting and feel of this Riad is unlike most accommodation available to modern day travellers. It is clean, comfortable, has friendly staff and is centrally located. I loved the sun-roof and roof top terrace. It was a fantastic introduction to Morocco and I would definitely recommend to others. The only thing is that it can get a little noisy, as most of the rooms are adjacent to the dining and communal area - so take ear plugs! Also I would advise you print off a map before you get there as the riad can be tricky to find. Other than that, this place was great!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2014,4,Helpful staff,"Not really a luxury riad, but comfortable, well situated, with most helpful staff. Out of all the different hotels that we stayed in, this was the only one to provide good photocopied maps of both the medina and the whole city, as well as sugesting the best places to visit. Rooms were fine, with modern rather than traditional furnishing.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2014,5,Feels like home,"We arrived late and the staff welcomed us very warmly with a moroccan tea and some cookies. I ultimately felt like home and was happy to be there after a long travel day. They gave us a map of the medina, explained us how to get to the touristic places and recommended us a beautiful and cheap restaurant for dinner (Dar Naji). The room on the second floor was not very spacious but very clean and comfortable. The bath room was very big though. The breakfast was very moroccan which I appreciated a lot, it was very good (and also a lot). Staff is very helpful and nice! I loved it there and would definitely recommend it!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2013,5,Gem in the Rabat Medina,"This was a great find in the heart of the Rabat Medina. The Ryad is a little difficult to find as there is no car access to the door. The staff that greeted us upon our arrival was friendly. The room was a little small. The bed took up most of the space and there was not much room to move about. That said, we were only in the room to sleep so the lack of extra room was okay. The room had an individual heater which was nice since the evenings tended to get a little chilly. The bathroom was also extremely clean and surprisingly spacious. Breakfast was nice and simple. Overall a good find and a good value in Rabat.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2014,4,Enjoyable,"We found the staff friendly and polite. We were allocated a light, spacious room on the roof, which we thought was very nice. The breakfast was good - real orange juice and strong coffee! The riad is well located for the kasbah and for a walk beside the sea.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2013,3,Disappointing given the Trip Advisor rating,We arrived very late due to problems at the airport but telephoned ahead. It was very cold and no heating was offered. The room was okay but it was very tight on both sides of the bed as there was little room between the bed and walls. We had arranged for a snack on arrival which was okay but very expensive. We would not have ordered this if we had realised the price - nearly 4 time what a meal cost in a good local restaurant. No one offered to help with the bags on departure. Overall it was disappointing. It seemed to depend on who was on duty how welcome you were made to feel.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2013,2,Not good!,"I have just written 5 reviews on hotels we stayed at on a trip around Morocco, all good or very good. Not this one! What a disappointment. All Medina Ryads can be off putting from the approach then the door opens to a warm welcome and at least good accommodation in this price bracket. Well we got the warm welcome because Nora was on duty, she is lovely and completely wasted here. She showed us to our suite, we payed the ""parking guardian"" to carry our bags up the stairs, not ideal! he then went back to his life on the street. We couldn't eat that evening because we hadn't booked at breakfast, difficult because we had not arrived! The cheaper room we had been shown was better than our suite, we should have moved, I don't think anyone else was staying. The bathroom was OK in…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2013,2,Disappointed,"How this hotel/riad came to be 4th place in Rabat is a mistery to my husband and I. Is the hotel staff attentive and nice? Yes. Do they make every effort to accomodate you? Yes. All a hotel needs to be a nice one is an attentive staff? No. The towels and bed sheets are really worn out from use and washing, aside from being very small. The double bed is two single beds put together - this is pretty normal at hotels, but in Dar Zouhour the bottom sheet was from single beds, so the beds wouldn't stay together. Zero privacy on the bathroom, since it has no roof, just walls and a door separating it from the bedroom. And if you, like me, stay in the Hibiscous Room be prepared to hear and smell everything that's happening in the kitchen and patio - if I understood arabic I would…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2013,2,Not really worth the money,"The room smelled of damp. Really strongly. The rug by the bed was filthy. The bathroom was nice and the water was nice and hot. My traveling partner woke up covered in bites (I never get bitten, I'm lucky). The Riad was nice overall but not worth the money. Breakfast was as standard in Morocco. Beware when booking an Hammam in the Riad. For 20euro it's not actually a Hammam but is just a sauna.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2013,4,Medina oasis,"This is a really cute place to stay, the interior is beautiful furbished in a traditional moroccan style and the staff is pretty gentle... the only think for what you need to be carefull when you go to book your room is the right price to pay. For all the rest is a great place to suggest!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 August 2013,5,Beautiful oasis in central location,"Room was lovely and so very moroccan. Our room was big, with beautiful bathroom, comfortable bed and air con. The furniture was beautiful and very moroccan. Staff were amazing - so sweet and kind. We will defintely recommend to all our friends travelling to Rabat.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2013,5,Such a warm and friendly place.,"We were recently in Rabat for a wedding. The Riad is at first a bit tricky to find as it is in the Medina but very close to the street and easy to access. The room was huge and beautifully decorated. It has a roof garden and a divine little courtyard where we ate breakfast. Overall the best thing was the staff who went out of their way to help us. They couldn't have been nicer and took a special interest in everything we were doing. I would recommend this place, especially if there are a few of you going or you are travelling as a family with young kids.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 August 2013,4,Short but sweet,"Only stayed here for one night and we got in late and left early so can't write too detailed a review. Riad itself is lovely and we chose to have breakfast on the roof terrace which was very nice. We did not have much contact with the staff but they appeared helpful and friendly. Breakfast was decent. Room was a little small but I think there are bigger ones to choose from in the Riad. As I said, we were there for a very short period of time but I had no complaints.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2013,4,A lovely Riad with very friendly staff,"We spent almost two weeks in this lovely Riad at the beginning of June 2013. We had chosen one of the suites on the second floor, and found it exactly as described - it was cosy, spacious and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and we felt right at home at Dar Zouhour. Also the location was excellent (in the Medina, close to the seaside and the Oudaïa Kasbah), and it was very easy to go anywhere on foot. We would recommend this Riad to anyone wanting to have a lovely stay in Rabat!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Charming and relaxing Riad,"Dar Zouhour is a lovely place to stay , is beautiful with typical moroccan touches and absolutely comfortable,is located in the Medina just five minute walking from the Kasbah des oudais ,the lady (NORA) how welcomed us with moroccan tea very friendly and helpful(she speaks english very well) as was the staff especially the owenrs (Aline and Alain ) are very nice. The breakfast was the typical breads with fresh orange juice and good coffee and hony,cheese,egges, olive, fruits,,,,,) We had dinner at the Riad which was very good and delicious(not expensive) Had a massage and Hammam as well I would certanly stay there again",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2013,5,Awesome place,If you want something really impressive you have to try riad hotels like Dar Zouhour. I've spent 14 nights here with my colleagues and everything was perfect. The staff was verry nice and friendly. Higly recomended!,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2013,5,Suprising stay,"Visiting Rabat on business. Found the Dar Zouhour to be a small clean and friendly hotel; with a staff who took an interest in our stay, directing us to places to eat and visit. The staff were also extremely helpful when my colleague lost his wallet, assisting in tracking down the taxi and other places where he may have lost it. Would recommend the hotel to stay, and will stay here on the next visit to Rabat.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2013,5,"Andrew, Debbie and Julia's Moroccan Adventure","After covering a vast area of Morocco, it was nice to finally end up in such a beautiful hotel. We spent 5 days and 4 nights at Dar Zouhour and were made to feel most welcome by Noura and her team. They always welcomed us with a pleasant smile. Noura's English was superb. Our rooms, which were on the first floor, were beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable and the house keeping standard was excellent. The breakfast was good and what a wonderful place to enjoy it in the wonderful courtyard. It certainly made a relaxing place to unwind after our brilliant two week adventure.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2012,5,Exquisite Dar Zouhour,"My husband, son and I spent two nights at Dar Zouhour during our stay in Rabat. The dar is absolutely beautiful. Noura was a wonderful hostess. She spoke English but also helped us with our Arabic. She also recommended places in Rabat to see and eat. Our room was very comfortable and the breakfast was pleasant. In the evenings we bought a bottle of wine from Noura and drank it on the rooftop. Wonderful experience. Moroccan evening and sounds. Loved it! I would definitely recommend Dar Zouhour as well as Rabat.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2013,4,"Great location, welcoming staff","We spent our first 3 nights in Morocco here, and came back for our last night of a 2 week holiday. We speak no Arabic and very little French, but Noura and her sister speak English and filled in all the blanks. All of the staff was always very courteous and helpful. The rooms are clean, welcoming bottled water and fruit, very good breakfast (yogurt, egg, typical breads, fruits). The location is easy to find (after the first time), and within walking distance of the Kasbah, the medina, several excellent restaurants, taxis cruise the nearby street. The central courtyard in the building is lovely, and the rooms surrounding it are amazingly quiet once you shut the windows and door. (We stayed in two different rooms on the first floor; the Sharazad is especially nice.) I loved…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2013,4,Morocco holiday,place was great. very beautiful. staff very nice and friendly. breakfast was great too. the room and courtyard are awesome .. we took pics of it as a reminder of how nice it was and there's a bonus of a hammam at the place (it costs extra to use it). it's not the real deal but it's nice if you're a couple as the real deal isn't an option.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2012,5,Excellent experience,This Riad was definitely a pleasant place to stay after a long flight to Morocco. There were 11 of us and we were given 4 rooms. All the rooms were clean and spacious enough. The receptionist was very helpful and tried her best to accommodate us despite the language barrier. The next morning we were served a delicious breakfast at the central yard inside the Riad. And we were happy with the fast internet service. We joined a tour and had our tour minivan so I couldn't comment on the location but seems like it's on a busy street.Definitely recommend this Riad in Rabat.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 February 2013,3,A good place to stay in the Medina,"Very central, you can walk to all the main historic sights. The suites are right on the central courtyard where breakfast is served and immediately next to reception which makes it a little noisy at night when guests come in and out of the front door.The rooms are also very dark - you need the light on in the day to see. My only real complaint is that the managers smoke,especially the night manager - i awoke a few times with the srong smell of cigarette smoke in mt bedroom. I mentioned and on the second night it was not an issue.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 January 2013,3,Fair hotel,"The hotel is good located and very central in Rabat. It is not that difficult to reach by car: The rooms are small and our experince is that some of the rooms smells of cats pee. Don`t know why but it is certainly not nice. The breakfast was nice and the experience is that everything is ok. You absolutely need to speak French or Arabic, because English does not excist here. It could be better.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2012,5,Excellent! I loved staying here.,"I had a warm welcome and very pleasant stay in a comfortable room. The Riad is nicely situated inside the Medina, a good location to explore Rabat from. The owners are very helpful and made an effort to make my stay even more enjoyable. Perfect!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2012,5,Dar Zouhour,"The place is far easier to find than it appears on the map. The Dar should provide a better map as an assistance, as to find it you have to go down a small straight street and take the third right, as simple as that, not complicated. We stayed for two nights. The Dar is central to many sights. We walked to the Kasbah, through the medina, down to Roman Cheilah and also the river. We never used any taxis as we could walk to any sights we wished to visit.The river was a great place to watch life. The staff could not have been more helpful in what they did within the Riad and with advice about outside. The staff here were the best we encountered in our 4 centre tour. Breakfast was good with a bit of variety. The Dar itself was beautiful and a wonderful find. My wife and I would…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 October 2012,3,Excellent location but small and smelly room,"My husband and l were in Rabat for just one night on our way to Al Jadida. We arrived by car and traffic in Rabat was awful, to park is also a challenging. We asked for directions and foud the place rather easily. The lady at the reception was friendly and recommended us a very nice restaurant. However our room was really small and the smell was terrible, it was like cat pee. We left the window open but it didn't help much. The bathroom was basic but spacious. Breakfast in the morning was okay, nothing special. For one night stay is fine, the riad is very central and allows you to get to the souks and main attraction, however l would not stay here for longer.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2012,5,A great place to stay,"We stayed here on the first night of our Morocco experience. What a great way to start. The staff were so friendly, our room was comfortable and breakfast was just lovely. The staff happilly gave us an early morning cup of tea and were very friendly and helpful even though we only spoke english we managed to communicate and be understood. I would happily recommend this to others",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2012,3,Nice place for Tourists,"Its a nice place for Tourists who are planning to stay here for a day or two. May not be ideal for someone in Rabat for Business Trip or staying for longer duration. People who manage this hotel are nice and friendly with the exception of: - You will have communication problem if you don't know French or Arabic - Expect to pay 3.5% tax if paying by CC which is not included in the nightly rate - The hotel arranged for a taxi in the early morning, but the taxi didn't show up. No one picked up my call at the hotel when I called to check about the taxi. Finally, I had to walk with my luggage about 1/2 a mile to pick a Grand Taxi that goes to Airport.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 August 2012,3,"Just average, a bit overpriced","This riad was in a good location, just inside the medina. The atrium and roof deck were lovely, but the room was quite small (it was hard to walk around the bed) and the air conditioning did not work particularly well. However, the bathroom was quite nice and very large. The biggest problem was with checking out and paying: we had an early train out of Rabat, so we asked to have breakfast a bit on the early side the day before. Breakfast was late, and the proprietress would not interrupt her breakfast to let us pay and leave to catch our train. This made our morning a lot more stressful than it needed to be, and considering that we were paying 80 euro per night, I hoped for a little more.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2012,5,A perfect little spot in the medina,"I stayed here on my first night in Morocco, having arrived in Casablanca and made my way on the train to Rabat it was the perfect riad. Its in the old medina but easy to find. The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful! The riad is also perfectly situated as a base to explore Rabat and all the major sights are within walking distance. I arrived quite late and there wasn't anyone there who spoke particularly good English, having said that, I didn't speak particularly good French and the girl still went out of her way to help me even though it involved sign language and pictionary and a lot of patience. I cannot thank her enough, by the end of it I knew where to eat, where to visit, how to top up my phone, what time breakfast was and both of us were in fits of giggles. It…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 July 2012,5,Excellent! We loved it!,Staff extremely helpful. Served tea at our arrival. Gave us a map with directions for getting around the Medina. Good location but a bit of a challenge to find. Helpful Moroccan walked us to the front door. Room was a real treat and a great overall experience. We stayed on the bottom floor in a suite with a/c. Breakfast in the courtyard was delightful.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2012,4,Quiet spot in the Medina,"A lovely spot to stay in Rabat. The riad was clean, well kept and the staff was very friendly and spoke both english and french. The terrace upstairs is a great spot to have a quiet break from the city. Agree with the suggestions to ask for a map as it can be a bit tricky to navigate the medina. I would also suggest getting the ladies at the front desk to write the address down in both French and Arabic in order to be able to show cab drivers if you need to get there by car.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2012,3,"Good location, pretty riad","Good location in the medina, about a 10 minute walk to the Kasbah, and easy to find. Very nice Moroccan staff, one of whom spoke a good amount of English (and I would assume all spoke French). I stayed in the Iris room, which was nice, but my parents stayed in one of the suites, which was more expensive but also more lavishly decorated. Rooms on the ground floor open up onto the courtyard/main eating area, so potential for noise if one is looking to sleep in although this was not an issue for us. The riad has a hammam on the terrace which we did not use as it was pretty small and basically a steam room and shower. The owners were not as involved in the operations as in the other two riads in which we stayed on this trip. We only saw them in passing one evening and they seemed…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2012,5,Perfect Place,"It s a lovely small riad in the heart of the medina. Well located in a quiet area of the medina. Clean, good breakfast and a perfect shampoo and shower gel flavor orange.... I love that. Ask for a map before go there because the Medina is a confused area of Rabat.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2011,4,arabic welcome and sedate surroundings,this is a perfect place to stay if you're visiting rabat. i arranged friends to stay here when they were visiting me but i already had visitors staying... it's very peaceful inside. the courtyard and terrace are lovely to sit in and have breakfast. the rooms are of moroccan decor. everything in this riad seems to have been thought about in its restoration. it's convenient for the station and it's well lit although down a small lane. the staff couldn't be more welcoming or helpful. thoroughly recommended.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2012,5,"beautiful, convenient, comfortable, friendly -- you cannot lose with this one!","Riads are the way to go in Morocco, and Riad Dar Zouhour in Rabat is a perfect example of why. I loved everything about Riad Dar Zouhour: the beautiful, comfortable room (La Shahrazad - 1 night, Mimosa - 2 nights); great location for visiting Rabat; the immaculate facilities; the tray of tea and pastries brought to our room to welcome us; the attractive, peaceful ambience; the sumptuous breakfast (petit dejeuner on the terrace was a very special treat!), and above all the helpful, friendly staff. We left for a 2-day trip out of town and felt completely safe leaving bags with them. I would be very happy to stay here on my next trip to Rabat!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2012,3,Great location but a mixed review,"We stayed here one night at the end of March. It is a beautifully restored traditional building. It is ideally located for all the sites and only about a 15-20 minute walk from the station, which was how we arrived. Our room was attractive and comfortable the only downsides was that the bathroom is not completely separate from bedroom, separated by partition but with no ceiling. Breakfast was very good. They had stated that they took credit cards but didn’t so we had to go out and get cash from a nearby ATM. On return we immediately paid the receptionist who didn’t give a receipt and then forgot we had paid when we left later and asked us to pay again!",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2012,4,"Charming, comfortable Riad","Lovely old restored Riad. The courtyard is peaceful and beautiful. The rooms are just off the courtyard so that with the enormous doors fully open (we're talking camel sized double doors here) the room becomes a part of the open air courtyard. The staff was wonderful and the included breakfast quite nice. Location is a bit tricky as it is off a pedestrian- only street in the old medina. The taxi drops you off about 50 meters or so from the Riad, outside one of the gates to the medina.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 January 2012,4,Good property for a short stay,"We spent 1 night here in the Mimosa room in January 2012. Locationwise, it is pretty central and close in walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The Dar is down a small street but the street is pretty well lit. There is also a keypad for entry so you don't have to worry about coming back after dinner and being let in. There are motion sensor lights throughout the Dar which keep it well lit. All the suites are downstairs and the smaller rooms are on the 2nd floor. Mimosa was one of the smaller rooms. It was fine for a 1 night stay but anything longer, you should consider a larger suite. We had breakfast in the courtyard as it was too cold to eat on the terrace. The disadvantage is that you cannot talk very loud as you may disturb the people staying in the…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 January 2012,4,Good Location and Clean,"Location (north side of the Medina) is great. It is quite but yet it is a short walk from main streets of Medina and short walk to Kasaba and other attractions. Also, very safe and clean area. Service is also good, especially Nouran, who gave me a Xerox copy of Medina map, and showed me all places of interest, best way to get to them, and how far they are, and she was very friendly, polite, and nice. Checked me in quickly, offered me mint tea, gave me code to entry door, and WiFi. The Riad look good, especially the yard, but compare to other Riads in Morocco, not as Charming. Breakfast was good and freshly made, including freshly squeezed OJ. Here are the stuff I didn't like, 1) No Hair dryer, and in room safe box. 2) Very Weak WiFi signal in the room 3)No help with…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 January 2012,5,Little gem in Rabat !,"Fabulous ryad in the medina of Rabat, close to the kasbah. Charming interior, well-equiped luxuruous room, a warm welcome and great service ! Nice terrace. Delicious breakfast. What more could one wish for ? A bit expensive compared to ryads in other cities, but that seems to be the case for all ryads in Rabat...",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 January 2012,4,Dar Zouhour,Lovely Riad close to the old fort and medina. The rooms are beautifully appointed and probably have the best bathrooms of any of the Riads we visited on our Moroccan trip. Nora was helpful in terms of showing us the local attractions on the map provided. The only mission was finding a reasonably priced restaurant for dinner.,Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 December 2011,5,Calm oasis after turbid travels,"After having a fairly relentlessly hassled time in Marrakech and Essaouira, we arrived at Rabat station to find nobody touting to take us to our riad. Quite refreshing to not have to fight our way through the bidding throng, but ultimately difficult to convince any taxis to take us into the medina, so we hoofed it ourself. The walk to Dar Zouhour took us through the new town and into the old through bustling streets full of Rabatis who were going about their own thing and not trailing us telling us the way ahead was closed. Brilliant! 1st impression of Rabat was one of a real functioning city, not reliant on the tourist dollar and as a result a great place to visit. Dar Zouhour is towards the north edge of the very clean medina and near the Kasbah. The staff were splendid and…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2011,5,Lovely Riad,"Really nice Riad in a small ""street"" in the middle of the old Medina. Looks nothing from the outside, but once inside, it is charming! The area can seem quite dark & scary feeling at night, although we were assured that walking home late was quite safe. The owner was very helpful and friendly and gave us a good recommendation for dinner; a bit hard to find, but we asked locals for directions. Our room was beautiful (on the ground floor), and had an authentic Moroccan feel with lovely colourful tiled walls, gorgeous lamps, rugs, etc. Breakfast was very nice, served in the courtyard with lush plants, fountain, tiles, etc. We only stayed one night in Rabat, but enjoyed our brief stay there. Dar Zouhour is recommended.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2011,4,Small morocco,"this hotel is typical Moroccan house, decor is awesome, rooms are clean, stuff is so friendly and helpful, the hotel in old city in morocco and the place is safe",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2011,3,Rabat in September,"location is okay although there are not really any restaurants nearby. accomadations are more than acceptable. if you want privacy, don't book a room on the main floor as the windows only have draps which means that other peoples conversations will carry into the room and vice versa Riad was helpful in providing instructions on how to find it in the Medina The only complaint we have is that the lady running the place was not very helpful providing us directions to the restaurant that we were trying to find. all she did was give us the street name.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2011,5,Peaceful and inviting Moroccan riad,"Wonderful location. Excellent, friendly and welcoming staff and owner. Breakfast was very good and dinner (if you order in advance) was excellent. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2011,5,A home away from home,"My wife and I just completed a 3-week driving trip in Morocco, and we began and ended the journey at the Riad Dar Zouhour. We were delighted upon our late-afternoon arrival there to find such a beautiful, quiet, secluded place to stay, and such a pleasant host in Noura, who was really the only staff person with whom we had contact during either visit. The first two-night stay was in one of the upstairs rooms--a bit of a climb up steep stairs with luggage, and after an overnight flight--which we found to be small, but comfortable. We couldn't leave our two suitcases open when we were using the room, but we were able to put needed clothing in the wardrobe, and toiletries on the counter in the nice bath. The unpleasant odor from the shower that other reviewers have described…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 November 2010,5,Authentic Moroccan guesthouse in the old city,"I really enjoyed my stay here, beautiful typical Moroccan style house, friendly service, comfortable, clean and quiet.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 September 2010,5,A palace of beauty. Really,"I write now here the recommendations about the places we stayed in our trip to Morocco and no doubt this was the most beautiful of all, no exaggerations! The Dar itself is a peace of art with attention to each tiny part. The room was extraordinary, and the service was excellent. It really made our stay in Rabat.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2010,3,A bit expensive...,"We only spent 1 night in Rabat and this was our first experience ever in a Riad. I was quite happy with it, but after having stayed in other Riads, I realized this one was just OK. The staff was really nice and always ready to help. In fact, I think that's the major strength of this Riad: the friendliness and sympathy of the staff. The Riad itself was very charming and quiet. And despite the fact that the bathroom had a musty smell, our room was nice and comfortable. However, I found the breakfast to be rather limited given the price we paid.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 June 2010,3,Fair value for the money,"This place is really more a B&B than a hotel; it has only 6 rooms and suites. It is a fair value for the money – I would say to definitely pay the little extra as we did and get a suite, which was spacious and clean. I visited one of their less expensive rooms which I found very small and cramped. The bathroom of our suite had a sewer-like smell which was unfortunate. The breakfast was a bit bland, but here again, we felt it was in line with what we were paying, so didn’t make an issue about this either.",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 May 2010,3,Overpriced but beautiful,"This riad houses 6 rooms, of which 3 on the ground floor and 3 on the first floor. The ground floor is used as breakfast hall, which can be annoying if you are still in your bed/romm, because it's really noisy. In our room there was a strong oudour of a not properly working plumming system in the shower. The Breakfast was poor, no fresh jus d'orange and bread for example, not enough for 100 euro. We booked online via booking.com because all other riads we already fully booked. We just didn't feel welcome as we did in other riads in Morocco. We paid 105 euro per night, because they charged 5 % for using a credit card",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 April 2010,4,Hidden Gem in the Medina,"It was not easy to find this Ríad in the middle of the night, as it is located in the Medina, but we were lucky enough to be picked up by one of the employees in the entrance of the Medina, after a quick conversation with our taxi driver. Our room was the ""Mimosa"", located in the first floor: it was not very big, but had space enough to us, a big wardrobe and a comfortable bed (although if you are tall you can have problems fitting in it, as in many Morocco hotels!) The bathroom was very big and clean, with a good spacious bath cabin. The breakfast, included in the price, is good with traditional products (juice, pastries, pancake, yoghurt...), but they only gave us a pancake, despite we were two...It is served in the courtyard, and is very pleasant and quiet. The staff was…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
 March 2010,4,An overall good experience,"Our stay in Riad Dar Zouhour in general was really good. We were very well received by the welcoming staff and the owners. Location of the riad is very good and we received great assistance upon arrival when parking our car in the chaotic streets of Rabat. We stayed in the standard rooms, which were pretty small and the beds a bit hard (not so comfy). However, when you book one of the amazing suites, you will be doing fine! Those are really beautiful, and really riad style. The French owners are beautiful people and really welcoming. One negative aspect was the bill at the end of our stay. As we had to eat in the riad due to the late arrival on the first day, and a sore foot at the second day, we were surprised to be charged Euro 15 per salad per person for a salad that I can…",Dar_Zouhour,Rabat
