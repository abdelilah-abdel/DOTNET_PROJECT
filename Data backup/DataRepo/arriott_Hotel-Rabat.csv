 August 2022,5,Lovely New Marriott Five Star,"The new Marriott in downtown Rabat is a delight. Opened for only 3 months or so, it’s an amazingly comfortable oasis in the middle of the city. The hotel amenities and attention to detail are exactly what one would expect from a Marriott five star. From the breakfast to the gym/spa, all 5 star quality and service. A special shout out to Mr. Amin from Meknes. Mr. Amin exemplified the Marriot five star standard, going out of his way to give us extremely good recommendations for our short stay in Rabat.

 December 2022,5,Awesome staff,"We spent 2 nights here near the end of a family vacation. If I return to Rabat, I will stay here again. The hotel is fairly new, and our rooms were incredible. One suite has a balcony which was a nice feature. Meal options in the hotel are quite good with the choice of French or Spanish food in addition to room service which has additional options. We had warm, friendly interactions with all of the staff. They went out of their way to treat us well.

The good: - Very modern hotel and rooms, and elegantly decorated common areas - Convenient location, close to a shopping mall and to the train station, not too far from main touristic sights by taxi - Excellent breakfast and food in the executive lounge What went less well (at first): - We had paid the stay with points.

 November 2022,5,Outstanding stay at new Rabat Marriott,"Our family of 3 adults and one teen had the pleasure of spending a night at Rabat Marriott on our arrival in Morocco for a 10-day tour - this hotel stay made for a terrific start to the trip! The hotel is brand new, having opened only a few months ago. That said, it is the incredible service throughout that really shines, in particular the warm welcome we received from Nabil. We also used the spa for a traditional hamam, which ended up being the best one of our entire trip. Our only regret is that we were only there for one night!",arriott_Hotel,Rabat
 November 2022,5,Excellent experience.,"I had an excellent experience at the Mariott in Rabat. The staff were very professional and accommodating. Nabil, the director helped me book my last minute reservation, and had the pleasure of meeting him in person as well. He went above and beyond to accommodate me and made sure I had an enjoyable stay. The hotel is ideally located in the center of Rabat and within walking distance to shops and restaurants. The outdoor pool, the rooms and the spa are all breathtaking. The hotel is fairly new and I was astonished at the very small details throughout the property. I highly recommend this place. I will most definitely stay here again next time I come back to Morocco.",arriott_Hotel,Rabat

We would like to thank and appreciate the lady from the reception Ms Samia took really good care of us, she is an incredible host full of energy and kindness, she gave us a list of places to visit in Rabat and also where to eat nice Moroccan dishes that we really loved, whenever we leave the hotel for a visit or when we comeback she is there to greet us and makes us feel home.

 October 2022,5,A fabulous new hotel option in Rabat!,"A great hotel in a high-end district of Rabat, opened in summer 2022 (around 3 months ago at the time of this review). The staff here are absolutely outstanding. From the reception, bars, restaurants, M club, spa - everyone blew us away with their warm smiles and attention to detail. Staff frequently remembered and used our names, which is a touch usually reserved for higher end brands than Marriott. Marriott Platinum benefits were honoured including an upgrade from a basic room to a beautiful full sized suite with 1.5 bathrooms and a huge L shape leather sofa. Access to the M Club was provided and we were attended to beautifully by the lovely lady that runs it.

 September 2022,5,"THE place to stay in Rabat, where you will be treated like royalty!","I had the fortune of staying here during a long stay, and I had an amazing experience. The hotel and the accommodations are excellent, given that the hotel is fairly new and just opened a few months ago. While you can find similar or maybe even better accommodations in Rabat, the thing that sets the Marriott apart is the quality of the service. Every single member of the staff will treat you like you are the most important guest in the hotel, and they will make you feel like royalty. The breakfast buffet is one of the best buffets I have seen, with a great variety of food, and very friendly staff. Hats off and kudos to Reda, one of the waiters there, who always greets you with a smile, is very attentive, and makes the best cappuccinos! He really goes above and beyond to…",arriott_Hotel,Rabat

 September 2022,5,Good Stay with Nice Pool,"We recently stayed here on a quick trip to Morocco. The hotel was nice. We had a king bed that was large and comfortable. We were upgraded to a suite room which was roomy. The only concern here was there no safety door lock I could find. I am used to having the second lock from the inside to lock the door. This actually keep me up a little bit as the doors on the rooms close hard and it sounds like someone was knocking on your door. The peace of mind with the additional lock would have helped, but once I got used to the noise, I slept great. The shower was large and water pressure was good. The towels were large and seemed fairly new. The pool area was large, and we were able to use it briefly after our day of touring Rabat, the pool was refreshing. We also had dinner…",arriott_Hotel,Rabat

 August 2022,5,Best Hotel in Rabat,"We were one week in this amazing Hotel, which is in a good location next to the new Arribat Center. Everything was well organized, the staff was very friendly and professional. Especially Front Desk Staff Med. Amine and Hajar. Breakfast and Service were also very good. Housekeeping made a great Job, everyone was helpful and very friendly. We loved the Pool and 24/7 Gym. The Spa Hamam Treatment and Massage by Ms.Meryam was incredible, it was one of the best Spa experience I ever had. It was the best Marriott and one of the best Hotels I have ever been.

 July 2022,4,Staff require more training,"It's a brand-new hotel, nice and clean. Breakfast has a good variety of food and drinks, only the egg station service was slow. One thing which the staff must learn is not to knock on the door of a guest if the 'Do Not Disturb' tag is displayed. I experienced the housekeeping staff kept knocking my door at 12.30am midnight to return my laundry when I was already fast asleep, with the 'Do Not Disturb' tag hung on the handle of my door. This is totally unacceptable. Also, there were tons of staff standing at the entrance to greet us when we arrived, but none of them offered help with our luggage. I hope the management would look into this matter seriously.",arriott_Hotel,Rabat
 July 2022,5,Stunning hotel. Amazing service,"This is probably one of the best hotels in Rabat, if not the best. It is evidently very new so it is well maintained and in top notch condition. The rooms are spacious, the shower pressure is strong, the breakfast is really good and I tried the Spanish tapas by the pool which were good too. The pool is nice, quiet and the lounge chairs are thick and well padded so they literally feel like a bed mattress. The hotel also has a small but sufficient gym with brand new high quality equipment. The spa was amazing as well. I tried an hour of the Moroccan hammam, followed by an hour of oil massage, and a hair blow dry at the salon. They are expensive services but you pay for a superb new facility and great service from the staff. I recommend Mariam who was my spa specialist - she…",arriott_Hotel,Rabat

The hotel is well located in the center, many restaurants within walking distance, the room is super confortable (i will miss my morning routine drinking coffee and reading on the terrace). It has a beautiful pool side as well for relaxing after long working days. I think the best asset the hotel has is its personnel. Amazing people, with a frank smile, helpful, welcoming and warm. Khadija Nadzi, Med. Amine, Samia at the front desk and the rest. Safae, Soukaina, and all the staff in the restaurant. Moussa and all the staff at the entrance. The housekeeping staff.

Our reservation was handled directly by the sales team (Kenza, Zineb and Anass) and we were offered an unbeatable group booking rate. The first impression was indeed very pleasant, the sales team was accommodating, proactive and very prompt with their responses. Check in was handled smoothly by the front desk staff who were all smiles and welcoming. They were aware that we had to check out early the very next day, so they reassured us that the breakfast team will be ready for us by 6.30am the next day.
