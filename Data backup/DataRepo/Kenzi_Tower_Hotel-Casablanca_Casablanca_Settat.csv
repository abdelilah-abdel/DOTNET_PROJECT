 December 2022,2,Disappointing,Disappointing. The hotel feels a little tired. I was amazed to see smokers in the lobby bar - allowing the smoke to drift into the reception area. Really - in 2022?! The lifts are possibly the worst I've ever experienced. Even the porters/conciergere acknowledged how slow they were. Another guest I'd met said he's spent 12 mins waiting for a lift and then stopping at several floors before he got to his floor. I'd also flag that although the hotel's location is good you can still hear all the beeping from the traffic below so It's not a quiet location. The room I was given on 18th floor was very spacious with a great view (fi you like heights) but the bathroom felt old and the shower holder didn't work - I had to just hold it.

Despite multiple requests we never received an extra pillow. The bar manager is rude and unprofessional. We ordered two drinks and after 20 minutes with no drink appearing or any evidence it was being assembled, we canceled our order to attend a scheduled dinner. Forty five minutes later the manager attempted to deliver the now unwanted cocktails. He accused us of lying that we canceled our order despite several others affirming our cancellation.

Nothing ‚ÄúMoroccan‚Äù about it other than the lovely views of the city from some rooms on the higher floors - but I don‚Äôt mean anything bad with that. Rooms were clean and tasteful with brand new fancy bathrooms and all necessary amenities. Food was sort of OK but most indifferent. Its Sky 28 bar provided easily accessible good fun with amazing views. Its other bar located on the ground floor was cuter and more elegant with its live soft jazz piano playing - but no views there!
