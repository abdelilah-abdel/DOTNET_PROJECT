 January 2023,5,Best decision of 2023,"We went on a chilling holiday trip for 3-night. It is an all-inclusive hotel and is 20 minutes from the city centre which we wanted, the hotel has a shuttle you can book by letting reception know. The hotel is clean, and friendly and has a warm welcoming atmosphere as soon as you enter. The staff is AMAZING and very accommodating, they go out of their way to help. The rooms are clean and roomy clean lines with tiled floors. I had to move as I did want to be near the entertainment which the hotel changed for me, so if want the same do not get rooms in front of the pool area. Every day the food has a theme of Italian, French, Morocco, etc. The only thing is if do not drink dairy then you need to make them aware of this as other types of milk will need to be arranged by them with…",hotelName,city
 November 2022,5,Sol Oasis paradise!,"Well we have just had a most wonderful 2 weeks at the Sol Oasis. The reviews we read were unanimously positive, and we must agree. Being our first foreign holiday since Covid, we only got our passports renewed this July, we were rather apprehensive of even travelling anywhere, let alone flying again to North Africa. But everything went well. The hotel was refurbished last year, and I can honestly say that we had no issues at all with anything at the hotel. The room was excellent, everything functioned perfectly including the lighting, door entry, bathroom and shower, fridge, and an ace foolproof safe. The cleaner was lovely, almost every day you could set your clock by the regularity of her visits, plus her cheery smile. Reception staff, often a letdown, were efficient and…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

Fatima sat with my girlfriend for 20 minutes while I was getting ready - they go above and beyond the line of duty - Impressive shows that included traditional Morrocan dancing, and fire juggling. - Morrocan Tea - it's revolutionary Cons: - Difficult to relax and read a good book by the pool when R&B music is blasting all day. A bit of variety and less volume would be best for this type of audience. - Entertainment staff were energetic, great to the kids and helpful. I admire their daily…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 December 2022,3,Disappointing service,"Over experience was disappointing. Service was generally poor. Rooms were not ready at checkin. Information and orientation at checkin was rushed. No information about the facilities, pool, towels etc. Had to request a cot bed several times that did not arrive until the evening. Laundry was not collected even after 3 days. No answer at reception despite calling several times. Not enough childrens high chairs at meal times and were not cleaned in between. Meal selection was generally good and decent quality however the breakfast egg station needs improvement. Eggs were made very haphazardly. All broken and half raw. Kids club was good and entertainers were very energetic and caring. Main pool temperature was okay but kiddy pool was freezing and not suitable for kids. The…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 December 2022,2,Beware of cats!,"We stayed in Dec 2022. Temperature was 20 degrees average. Its cold in the mornings before midday so you will need warm clothes. Our main issue and the reason why I've rated this hotel 2 stars is because of the cats. Stray cats are constantly in the buffet restaurant. The doors are left open and guests also bring them in. The French guests in particular liked them. But they should not be in the dining room, so unhygienic. They were climbing on the tables and sofas. We kept jumping out of our seats as they ran under our feet. The staff did not care. I complained many times and nobody seemed to care. What if someone was allergic to cats? Well if you are, this is not the place for you. I also complained to the general manager and he promised it would be fixed the next day, still…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 December 2022,4,Nice place we had a great stay,"Quality hotel out of the hustle and bustle. Room was fine, facilities great and all the staff were welcoming and friendly.

 December 2022,5,The perfect break,"We had the best few days at Sol Oasis. The food is amazing and there is a huge variety to enjoy each day. All of the staff are friendly, helpful and lots of fun.

Myself along with my wife and our elderly mother booked up for a 7 night stay and we were enjoying ourselves that much we ended up booking new flights and staying another 3 nights. Everything was just perfect ! Sam and all the animation team are the best. Also a big shout out to the rest of the Sol Oasis Team, from Housekeeping right up to the GM. It's the whole team that make Sol Oasis what it actually is and the reasons for having a 5 Star Trip Advisor rating. I've read a couple of reviews mention the lack of variety with the food and saying it wasn't all that good , Seriously ? If you were paying 5 Star prices for your ""All Inclusive Holiday"" then you might have something to complain about. The food was great with plenty variety and hats off to the…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 November 2022,4,Great Hotel & Great Entertainment Team,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Sol Oasis. We checked in late and it was quick and a plate of food waiting for us in our room. As per other reviews the entertainment team are their biggest asset. Mike is a top man amd brilliant dancer and along with Sam, Fati, Russ, Sousu and Nikao they are all so friendly and so much fun. The grounds and pool are nice and well kept. I have only given it 4 stars for 3 small reasons; 1. The food was very nice, however it was repetitive and not much variety compared to other AI holidays I've been on 2. The rooms are nice but our bathroom had lots of flies in it all the time and splat marks where other guests have killed them. There was also plaster coming off the walls at the shower 3. The bar staff are brilliant and kept us well refreshed,…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

The pool area is huge and plenty of beds always available. Evening entertainment is one of the best weve experienced and we had such a fun time. Sadly though a star was docked for the food im afraid. Whilst they have different theme nights every night, the food isnt great quality or variety and I actually barely ate anything due to this! Sad really as the rest of the hotel is fabulous. They also dont mention on the website that you have to pay for the use of the tapas restaurant, which i wish i would have known before as may well have chosen elsewhere as we like to have lots of food choice! Nevertheless we still had a great…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

Beautiful gardens although a lot of planting still being done, the seating areas etc were lovely and we particularly liked the huge firepits on the terrace in the evening. Everywhere kept lovely and clean. Entertainment was excellent, animation team very friendly and hardworking. We enjoyed the 2 guitarists that played most evenings too. Some of the music in the daytime got a bit noisy for us as we prefer to read and enjoy the peace. All the food we ate was excellent, very impressed with the buffet restaurant one of the nicest, we are not usually fans of them but plenty of seating inside and out and relaxed atmosphere.

The hotel is about 20 mins outside of Marrakech - the hotel provide a free shuttle throughout the day. The hotel has a lovely relaxed atmosphere - all the staff (bar, dining room, reception, entertainments) are super helpful and friendly.

 November 2022,5,Birthday,"Went with 3 of my friends to celebrate my birthday at the end of November, staff were extremely friendly and helpful with anything we needed. The main reason for such a great time has to go to Sam and his entertainment team, the vibes and energy given off by all of them throughout our stay was really good and positive, whether it was during activities or just socialising with different guests they were all exceptional.

The food is very good also the entertainment team are doing a very gooodd job without forgetting sousou at the kids club ,she is so lovely as well as the rest of the team ,I recommend it so much",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Beautiful hotel 5 star in my opinion.,"No high rise buildings here, ground and one floor above. Rooms fine, bedding comfy, bathroom large with good shower power. Food is fabulous, something for everyone and plenty to choose from. Outside area is big, room for plenty of sunbeds round the pool. Lovely gardens, ideal for a cool off in a deck chair amongst the palm trees for shade. So picturesque. Shuttle bus into Marrakesh is provided free, a few times a day, & incls return. This is ideal as there is nowhere to walk to, outside the hotel, as it's in the desert about 5 miles from city centre. But you will find after the hot and hectic city, that it's a godsend to return to the calm of this beautiful hotel. All staff helpful and smiling. So glad we stayed here. Thank you to everyone who works at this hotel for making…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 November 2022,5,Sol Oasis Review,"After spending four days in Marrakech in a Raid (Nasreen, which was excellent) itself and exeriencing the hustle of bustle of this lively city it was great to carry on the experience at the Sol Oasis. When I first got there I did initially think, what am I going to do for ten days! I was so wrong....it was a great base to do other things..Atlas Mountains and an unforgettable balloon ride as an example. The real key that made it was the absolutely amazing entertainment team...the enthusiasm and energy so real ...led by my new friend Aniko. So hilarious, professional and talented... Yeeess..I would go back.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,amazing staff,"staff were amazing and welcoming. EVERYONE in the Entertainment team were genuinely nice..

 November 2022,5,Amazing. Just perfect!,Wow! My wife and I have stayed in a few all inclusive hotels but this one is certainly up there as one of the best and certainly the best value for money. I cannot fault anything. The staff were amazing. Sam runs the entertainment team and they were all superb. The food was great. Loads to choose from. The drinks were perfect and the place was spotless. You can relax here or take a free hotel shuttle bus into Marrakesh for a completely different experience. I would definitely rate this as a five star hotel. Thank you to all the management and staff for making this Hotel amazing! Keep up the high standards with tremendous staff! We will be back!,Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Highly recommended,"This hotel is great! Everyone mentions the animation team, who are fun and attentive, but so are the rest of the staff there. All very helpful and with a smile on their faces. The food was very tasty and plentiful. Some reviews mentioned flies on the food served outdoors in the snack bar. The hotel must be reacting quickly to these reviews because when I was there the outside food was covered by clingfilm. Everywhere is kept spotlessly clean. The shuttle into Marrakech is frequent throughout the day/evening but make sure you book it at reception a day or 2 in advance if you want a specific time. I’m glad I stayed in this hotel rather than a Riad in Marrakech. The city is crazy, noisy and polluted so it’s good to be able to visit for half a day and retreat back to the calm of the…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 November 2022,5,Exceptional hotel with great staff,My husband and I visited this resort for one week. It was a fusion of authentic Moroccan hospitality combined with modern high standards and it should have a 5 star rating. All the positive comments are true. The staff cannot do enough to enhance guests' experience. We arrived late at night and the reception arranged for some food to be delivered to our room. I feel that this resort review all the feedback and then implement changes to keep evolving their service. The room was clean and pleasant. The restaurant was fantastic with a wide diversity of fresh food. The salads were very exciting and totally safe so obviously washed in bottled water. Mohammed and all the waiting team were friendly and helpful. Mohcine and all the bar staff provided exemplary service at the pool and…,Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Perfect hotel for Marrakech,"Had a lovely week in the Sol Oasis Marrakech. The hotel is clean, staff are friendly & efficient and the food was great. Our room was small but perfect for what we needed. We arrived late on our first night but with plenty of reception staff on duty check in was efficient and painless. There are plenty of activities to participate in during the day if you want to get involved in them (coordinated by the animation team) but if not the pool and loungers are immaculate so perfect for relaxing in the sun. You can also use the activities equipment at any time yourself. The pool staff were always quick to help with loungers or umbrellas, nothing was too much trouble. There is free shuttle bus into the city which needs booked in advance at reception but runs regularly and takes…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Excellent week of winter sun and smiles.,"Comfortable room, good shower, toiletries provided, room tidied every day. Beautiful hotel. Excellent food. Engaging and friendly entertainment team. Friendly staff all round. Few tips and specific mentions. There is a shuttle to and from centre of Marrakesh, you must book ahead, as it’s well utilised. Food is varied and great quality, always different tagines to try. Entertainment team are excellent. Reda (coach)for yoga and aqua aerobics, and humour. Russ, we first noticed Russ at bingo night with his infectious smile and giggle, we soon learned that Russ was an excellent dancer and front man in the Bollywood show. Abdul is a ray of sunlight, constantly smiling and so full of energy, just watching him be so happy made us smile every day. Miko we noticed half way through the…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Amazing 5 day break,"Absolutely loved out stay at Sol Oasis. Absolutely stunning hotel, room was Morden and decent size. Food was very good but not great, pasta station was 10/10 however we found the food very reparative but me and my partner are foodies so that might have a factor init, omelette station was 10/10 in the morning. The pol area was stunning, very relaxing. Free shuttle bus that takes you right into the centre was very handy, the road are mad out there 😂 but the Medina is an expensive you have to do at least once if not more. The thing that made the hotel for us were the staff, every single member went above and beyond. The whole animation team were the loviest bunch, they all spent time and spoke with everyone. Great team. Mike, what a legend. The bar staff working the 5 days we were…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,A great holiday experience,"5/5 experience. Sol oasis was perfect mix of city experience (regular bus shuttles run by hotel to Marrakesh city) and relaxing by the pool or at the bar. Exceptionally clean hotel. Good, modern rooms with a great shower. Staff were all excellent, could not do more to help you. Food was superb, good selection and also good chance to experience moroccan cuisine, as well as food to please picky eaters. Big thanks to the animation team who made our experience extra special. Great options to join in a wide variety of activities - water polo, water Zumba, table tennis and volley ball. Extra big thanks to Fati, Sam and Abdul who were always full of energy, charisma and made our holiday experience special.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,A great experience!,"We would highly recommend staying in Sol oasis. Good food, good cocktails. Very clean hotel and very friendly staff. Close to Marrakesh city with shuttle buses running regularly during the day, a good mix between city experience and relaxing by the pool. A particular thank you to the animation team who made our holiday an extra special experience - getting us involved in table tennis, darts, volleyball, water polo…. In particular a big thanks to Fati, Sam and Abdul who always had a smile and full of energy. They made our holiday extra fun, thank you!",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,5,Sam is the best entertainer,What a lovely time we had at sol oasis. Beautiful resort with equally beautiful people. Made to feel special from start to finish. The whole staff are a credit to the hotel. Special mention to Sam and mehdi ❤️,Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,2,Noisy and not a luxury hotel,"While Sol Oasis has kind staff, it is a shame that I am giving a negative review because of one staff and company who made our trip horrible. On our last night, a company (willing.fr) had checked in for a corporate trip. A group of unruly, barbaric men were yelling, shouting and banging on doors and walls drunk at 2am. It was loud enough that the entire hotel heard it. We heard a neighbouring guest ask them to be quiet, but the men ran to their room, started banging on their door and challenged them “you dare ask us to shush?”. We felt unsafe and called the staff twice- once immediately and once again in 45 minutes when no one came to stop them. No one came that night to stop them- we suspect the drunks eventually fell asleep on their own accord. I understand the hotel cannot do…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 October 2022,5,"Brilliant, brilliant place","Can't speak highly enough of this hotel. The grounds and rooms are beautiful, the food is gorgeous and varied and the staff genuinely can't do enough for you. I would go back in a heartbeat and if you are reading reviews considering whether to book, do it - you won't regret it!",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,3,Don’t let the 5 star reviews mislead you!,"After reading all of the 5 star amazing reviews, I thought this place was too good to be true! IT IS, all the 5 star reviews mention the animation team and not much else. Don’t get me wrong the animation team are great if you want to join in, but if that’s not your thing then they can be quite full on! However they work very hard, start early in the morning and finish late at night and everyone always had a smile on their face! So I take my hats off to them. The hotel itself is very clean, however the rooms are small, ours didn’t have anywhere to dry our wet clothes which was annoying! The food at the hotel was the worst food I’ve ever eaten in my life. Bland, cold and boring. Some nights we didn’t even eat as the buffet was awful. The only saving grace is, they have…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,3,Not for us,The positives: The hotel is spotlessly clean and is well furnished in the communal areas. Our room was well set up with a very comfortable bed and nice bedding. The bathroom had a hairdryer that was powerful and the shower was excellent. The two acoustic singers by the bar in the evenings were very good. The free shuttle service into Marrakech was great. The negatives: The bathroom door is a swing type so has a gap where they meet so not quite as private as a bathroom should be. Food was at best average. You get one night (without a surcharge) at the restaurant and the rest of the time you have to eat in the buffet restaurant where the food is ok but flies are flying around the food and the hot food wasn’t very hot . The one night we had at the restaurant my meal was pleasant…,Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 October 2022,5,Magnificent hotel,Just returned from a 2 week stay at Sol Oasis Marrakech with my partner and family. We were there end of October to the start of November and the weather was so hot. On arrival you walk through a beautiful archway with a stunning walkway to reception. Reception staff were friendly and helpful and got us checked in quickly. We were taken to our rooms and luggage arrived by trolley so we didn’t have to carry them to our room ourselves which was good and not like some other resorts. The rooms were beautiful and colourful and always kept clean. We were in room 1706 and our house keeping lady was outstanding (sorry forgot her name). For all inclusive the food selection was impressive and very fresh and had a lot of various cuisine. There is a pasta station inside the…,Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 November 2022,4,Just shy of Excellent an amazing experience x,This review does deserve excellent but a few minor points meant I had to give this very good instead of excellent .. we arrived on the 31st October for a 7 Nights Stay . A hotel with class and some of the best staff that can be found I have ever come across absolutely an amazing hotel. The room was beautiful but because we had our son staying with us the sofa could have been better quality we had to ask a few times to get the adjustments correct but we got there in the end we were staying all inclusive so it can be a hit and miss . Restaurant times were breakfast 7till 10.30. Breakfast was 12 pm till 3pm And dinner 7.30 till 10pm if I remember correctly with afternoon snacks between 4 and 6 pm .

Lovely weather in the 30s in November. Pool is the perfect temperature! A/C in the rooms are brilliant and are quick to cool your room down. Rooms are cleaned daily with fresh towels given. The presentation and care by the cleaning staff is beautiful. The entertainment team are absolutely fantastic. They put on impressive dance shows indoors, then outdoors most nights games and songs all evening. Sam does a brilliant job at keeping the audience engaged. Everyone can join in with games and activities but if you don't want to, you won't be forced. Staff were coming round all day to chat and keep you company.

 November 2022,5,Fantastic holiday at the Sol Oasis,"We booked a weeks holiday at the Sol Oasis, visiting at the start of November. Overall we have had an excellent time at the hotel, especially with quality of entertainment provided by the staff. The level of customer interaction and engagement was exemplary. I've never stayed at a hotel, where I've genuinely become good friends with many of the staff. We found that we were thoroughly entertained every single day. We would have liked to have seen a clearer schedule of events though, as at times we were suddenly getting involved in activities at very short notice. But otherwise I can't fault the teams efforts to keep everyone in good spirits. The hotel itself is well maintained. The gardens are immaculate, with neat and tidy rooms. We only had one minor issue with the toilet…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 October 2022,4,"An honest, balanced review","Just returned from a five night holiday at the Sol Oasis Marrakech and we were, overall, impressed with our stay. Room Our room contained a large double bed and an armchair that converted into a single bed. Space was a little tight when the single bed was out, but it was fine for a short stay. Great air-con, decent shower, comfortable beds, a safe and a good sized fridge for keeping water cold. Wardrobe space is a little limited, especially if three people are sharing. We also asked, repeatedly for a third towel and water glass, but never got them. Food Buffet breakfasts, lunches and evening meals were outstanding. A really great selection of dishes to choose from - genuinely something for everyone. Hot food piping hot and cold food well-chilled. Very, very well run part of…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 October 2022,3,"Lacking finesse, quantity over quality","On arrival at the Sol Oasis you are greeted by a beautiful picturesque building. Check in was short and sweet (with no real information about what was what!) and we presume as we arrived at midnight all the welcome cocktails had been cleared away. The key cards didn't arrive when we got to the room. The porter let us in and said he would return quickly with new cards. You will find not a lot happens quickly! The staff are very helpful but seem to always have more than 1 conversation on the go so you don't know if they are dealing with you or not? We were tired and Hungry so ordered room service.

Had a great stay, 1st time in Morocco.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Amazing holiday and an amazing team!,"There is no surprise as to why the reviews for this hotel are glowing; the hotel is well maintained and spotlessly clean, the photos on here really don’t do it enough justice! As well as serving Moroccan dishes in the main restaurant, every evening there is a themed menu which you can find out about in reception. There also a snack bar that doubles up as a fresh pizza station of an evening and an authentic a la carte on site (I’d recommend booking at the beginning of you holiday to ensure a space). Although it’s not all year round, the whole team made such an occasion out of Halloween with fantastic cocktails and themed menu. The thing that really sells this hotel though is the incredible team, who all made our holiday so special. Everything is done at 110% and they really do…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Fabulous,"Just a few words about this little gem of a hotel The reviews say it all - number 9 out of over 700 hotels .............. not to be found on many UK package hotel sites, its charm lies in its typically European flavour (anyone that knows the Sol brand will know this!), mixed with the feel of staying in a typical Moroccan Riad. The place is spotless! And the staff are amazingly friendly and encouraging tou to join in as little or as much as you want Also super talented. Best evening shows we have seen anywhere! Food is fab - family of 4 Inc 2 teens and not one complaint in 7 days. The whe place is Simply perfect...................... Thank you Sol Oasis for having us - we are having a blast! Free shuttle bus to marrakech is a.must but need to pre book as very popular .…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Best hotel,"So I never write reviews but it’s been one of the best trips I’ve ever had. Sam is amazing at organising the shows. Mike is amazing with his dancing and dealing with us! All staff is amazing and couldn’t compare to anywhere we’ve stayed before. Also, I want the best hotels we’ve stay at. One thing I said, make sure you buy fly repellent because the flies are bad. However that’s everywhere in Marrakesh! It’s amazing you must stay!",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Incredible Hotel,"Sol Oasis was incredible. The all inclusive was great, hotel, food, great drink choices the lot. The only thing to bear in mind, which is no slight to the hotel is the flys. Please bring insect repellent. The best thing about the hotel is the entertainment staff, mainly Sam and Mike. They are the best hosts in the world.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

You wonder how they have the energy to do all the activities all day. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to book.,Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 October 2022,1,Terrible start!!!,"We have arrived this evening and had a terrible start to our stay here at Sol Oasis!! Travelling with 5 adults and 3 children. We arrived around 11.15 this evening and by the time we checked in and were shown to our rooms it was almost 12pm. We went to the bar area to see if there was something to eat and drink. We were greeted with the announcement that we would need to pay for anything we had because the all-inclusive we had already paid for ended at 11pm!!! I went to reception expecting to be told there had been a mistake as we didn't arrive until after this time, to be told that if we wanted food we should have ordered before arriving!!!! If the minibar in our room was filled I would not have been so upset but in our minibar was a few pieces of fruit that had passed its…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

Food was good if your meat eater, hotel it self is far from the main city of Marrakesh, there is a shuttle bus check the times and book early as they are always fully booked. Rooms are clean and spacious, staff are always smiling. There is no spa at the moment, staff were accommodating and recommended one in town Les Bains Du Lotus, staff arranged drop off and pick up it was relaxing experience. Would definitely recommend to families and I would visit again.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

The range of activities exceeded my expectations. Free Shuttle bus to Marrakesh was great. Would definitely come back.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 October 2022,4,"Oasis outside of Marrakech, but quite a trek outside of the city","Good clean hotel, an oasis outside of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The rooms are spacious and well decorated. Food is buffet-style with the exception of a couple of restaurants. The bar area overlooks the pool and there is live music every night. The downside is that it is really in the middle of nowhere, you can't go out of the resort for a walk, it's all desert. There is a free shuttle into Marrakech but it only holds 15 to 20 people, has to be pre- booked and is not that frequent (eg just 3 buses in the morning). And the return bus either comes back at 4pm which is too early or 9pm which is too late. The alternative is taxi at EUR20 each way. Other not so good aspects: the food is fairly average, more canteen-style. We ate better everywhere outside of the hotel. And…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,A fantastic winter sun holiday ♥️,"What a week we have had. The food, the hotel grounds, the STAFF!!!

 October 2022,5,Just AMAZING !!!,"An honest review, we arrived around mid day and was greeted by a smiling bus boy who took all our luggage straight away. The hotel allowed us to check in early which was a pleasant surprise which meant we could unpack and hit the pool straight away. As soon as we hit the pool we was greeted by the animation team the names to look out for is Sam and Russ but to be honest those are the names I could remember but the whole team are amazing! on a few occasions one of them would join us us for dinner lunch or breakfast and we would exchange stories from each others lives which was nice they made you feel like friends and not just guests, Sam even gave us two paintings from his house for us to bring back to the uk for my kids to have they thought they was amazing! thank you again Sam…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 October 2022,4,Four Old Men In Search Of An Oasis?,"We, four brothers, all well over into our seventies, have been looking for a suitable hotel to celebrate our second holiday together. Fussy, choosey, and hard to please, it was not easy to select our"" Perfect Shangri-La""! After some diligent search by the two of us, we zeroed in on a rather appropriately named 'Sol Oases' hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco. Located at the outer rim of Marrakesh, it took about 20 minutes to reach the hotel. from the Menara airport. Although dark by the time we reached our chosen 'Shangri-La' One unmistakable impression we were given was the startling resemblance to the world-famous Court Of The Lions building in Granada, Spain. It is beautiful and oh, so very tranquil! A quality that is unmissable even in the gathering darkness. The rooms were…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 October 2022,5,Amazing,"My wife and I booked this trip on a whim, and after 10 days we have had the best time. Where do I start?! The place is always clean and tidy, the rooms are clean, the food is always different and they do a different theme every night and it tastes sooo good. The staff there are amazing. The bar staff are amazing and work so hard. And last but by no means least, the entertainment team have made this holiday for us. We read reviews before and everyone mentioned this team, but until you experience it for yourself, you realise why. During the day, if you want to, (and they're not pushy if you don't), there's loads to do and it's just really good fun. We've done darts, archery, table tennis, belly dancing, Cha Cha Cha and loads more. The evenings have been so much fun, the shows…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 October 2022,5,Had to Write!,"Don't always write reviews and I can be cynical reading some. However, I have to agree with my fellow reviewers about the Sol Oasis. It's got a certain something that other hotels/AI resorts just don't have, a magical joie de vivre I got to practice my French). It's not the biggest resort, it doesn't necessarily have the best facilities, it's a few miles from town, the bars close at 11pm etc yet somehow it conquers all these disadvantages to deliver the perfect holiday experience whether you're 6 or 61 (me). The animation team throughout the day turn into your entertainment team for the evening giving you a different show every night. Big shout out to MC Sam, ZouZou, Mike, Russ and the entire team. I'm generally not a big fan of buffet style eating and the associated faff…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

There was never a dull moment and the animation team would spend their days chatting to us, encouraging us to do activities and evenings putting on amazing shows.

The energetic entertainment crew were the life and soul. Big shout outs to Ross,Sam, Niako, Mike and all the gang. If you like being involved then this is the place for you.

The rooms themselves were very nice and clean, with a Moroccan feel with the decor yet still felt quite modern. The bar staff were all very friendly and the Mojitos were especially tasty. We absolutely loved the food, especially all the French desserts however, I think to improve it would be great to have the allergen information written next to the names of the dishes.

They're exceptionally great at what they do and always full of energy and smiles. Our room was gorgeous, and cleaned regularly, if we needed. We were looked after daily by the bar staff.

 August 2022,5,Amazing Entertainment Team,"We visited as a couple, having been to Marrakech on multiple occasions before but never to Sol Oasis. Hotel was very nice, as expected from photos. Plenty beds, good wifi and gym facilities. We loved the variety of food and looked forward to every meal, and found the waiters in the restaurant to be very attentive. I also must give a special shout out to the Entertainment team, they were friendly from day one and made sure we could join in with anything we wanted to, and even encouraged us to do things we usually wouldn't have! Niako made me laugh every day and even convinced me to try my hand at archery by the end of the holiday, and Sam did a great job of teaching me basis arabic.

 August 2022,5,An Amazing family holiday that we will not forget,"We visited Sol Oasis Marrakesh at the end of August 2022. It had been our first family sun holiday since pre Covid and our first time to Marrakesh. We booked a Family Extra Suite and it was perfect, King bed in main bedroom, and a pull out Sofa Bed in living area which was very comfortable, with a nice big bathroom, terrace and balcony area, also wardrobe, safe, coffee making facilities and 2 x air con units which keep the room at the perfect temperature. House keeping called daily and changed bed linen and towels, and room was cleaned to a very high standard. The hotel and grounds are kept in immaculate condition, there are a couple of different bar areas, but we mainly used bar area by pool as that was where all the entertainment was. The All inclusive food selection was to a…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 September 2022,4,"Great break, looking forward to coming back","We travelled to Sol Oasis on a 7-day getaway with the aim to have a relaxing holiday and explore Marrakesh; which we did - sort of. The hotel itself is very “Instagrammable” with lovely architecture and lighting throughout, but the real life of the hotel comes from the entertainment team - especially Mousse, SouSou and Sam. With games throughout the day, we found ourselves leaving the hotel less than we intended to so we could stick around for water-sports, the odd pool game and some of the activities on site. We met some amazing people out there too who we plan to keep in touch with and come back to Sol Oasis for a reunion but until then, here’s what we loved and we’d recommend… WHAT WE LOVED… - The people, super friendly guests and hotel staff - Water polo in the pool…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 September 2022,4,Nice relaxing holiday,"Just returned from a week at Sol Oasis. Had a lovely relaxing time. The grounds are spotless and great ambiance, especially the live music at night. The food choice was extensive, some of the desserts were amazing, it was clear a lot of work and planning goes into the food preparation, appearance and choice. The only thing we would of changed is that it was not always hot, more warm, however we did notice a microwave towards the end of the week which we probably could of used. Special shout out to the entertainment staff who are really friendly and engaging, however, I think the unsung hero's are the waiting and the cleaning staff who work quietly behind the scenes making sure everything runs smoothly. Thanks to the bartender in the inside bar, she is a lovely friendly person.…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

It’s not really fair of me to mention names as all the staff work super hard but I’ve got to give a shout out to “Ross”. The hotel is lovely in how it’s set out and looks especially nice at night when it’s all lit up. We had a day out to the “Souk” in Marrakech with some others couples from the hotel. Had a great day and would recommend it as an experience. Keep up the good work Sol Oasis.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

Very nice modern hotel. clean and tidy rooms with good shower and comfortable bed. Swimming pool is good and had no problem getting a sun lounger during the 2 week stay. Animation team are the best thing about this hotel. They are the most energetic exciting welcoming and fun that we’ve seen at any hotel they deserve a pay rise as they are the thing that separates this hotel from any others before. Personally I can’t see any other hotel beating it. There is good variety of shows activities and games during the day and always happy to sit down and talk for hours and even eat dinner with you and really do go the extra mile in helping you with everything you need in regards to any problems or queries in hotel (even more so than the reception team.)…,Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 August 2022,4,A lovely holiday,"What a beautiful hotel and fantastic animation staff with such talent. My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our 10 day stay at Sol Oasis, particularly down to Sam, who I will mention a bit later. My partner and I arrived at Sol Oasis at around 11:30am and were told that our room was delayed due to people checking out late… after reading another review that has said the same thing, I am unsure now if this is true or if it’s just something the hotel says when they / the cleaners are running behind. Anyway - We were told the wait would be around an hour or two, and this was fine - it gave us the chance to get some lunch from the buffet, to look around the grounds and to have a little nap as we were tired from travelling. My partner asked reception again after around 2 hours and…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,Number One is Sam,"This was our second trip back to Sol Oasis in 3 months! What a brilliant experience we have had both times. Our first trip was as a family of 4 with a Family Suite, beautiful spacious room which was perfectly maintained on a daily basis. The hotel itself was lovely and clean, the food was incredible. We had a day trip out to the traditional souks which was a great experience. We met some interesting people and fell in love with Marrakech. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and incredibly nice. On arriving at the hotel we had our first encounter with the animation team Russ and Dounia , this was the beginning of our adventure. We were soon to meet the rest of the team, what an amazing bunch of young people ..... excellent all round entertainment. Truly cannot fault these…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 August 2022,4,Summer of happiness!,"Where do I begin with this hotel? I will begin like any good story, at the beginning. We arrived at the beautiful ‘sol oasis’ at approximately 11.30 am on the 21st of august 2022, we climbed out of the taxi and was greeted by a very smiley and approachable security guard at the front gate who asked for me details and checked them off on his sheet, quickly after this we was approached by a young fellow who took our suitcases from us so we didn’t have to walk with them which was a nice touch. We entered the beautifully decorated and clean and lovely smelling reception and made our way to the front desk where we spoke with a very stern and serious receptionist. He stated that as we was having a special room our room wasn’t quite ready yet, we was fine with this and went for a…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,Sam is the best,Sam is a excellent host and would say the best I’ve ever came across in years of trips away.

Perfect host of both the kids and adults with a great mixture of ability’s too singing and magic tricks. Had the best time away!

 August 2022,3,Good but busy,"The hotel itself is very nice, lovely grounds which are well kept. A small room but it had everything you needed - the balcony was very small and backed onto a muddy area which was odd. The food was great a lovely choice and really tasty, there was an issue with wasps however so that does need looking into. The drinks were great but the que for the bar not so great, there is no waiter service as such as everyone was so busy. No water in your room which can be a problem if you forget to grab some from the bar before it closes. You need to be up at 7.30 to get a sun bed, it was crazy how people were allowed to put towels out and then go off out for the day. The sun shades were broken so I felt sorry for the staff struggling to put them up! The evening entertainment was great…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,Immaculate hotel with amazing staff and rooms,"Lovely mid range hotel. Immaculate grounds, super friendly staff. Literally support staff around all the time cleaning up, tending to the gardens, cooing over the toddler! Reception super friendly and organised a taxi to the airport for 250dhs. Food is lovely, large choice of Moroccan foods at the buffet, lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, they also have a bbq on in the afternoon with burgers, chips, local food, grilled chicken, sardines etc. I note the previous review commenting on the lack of ice cream…..true the ice cream is only with dinner but the kids can get strawberry slushies any time of day which was even better! Special mention to sousou and zisou (sorry if not spelt right!) in the kids club. They are awesome with the kids and so kind and friendly, with incredible…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 August 2022,5,Outstanding Hotel and staff,"Not too sure where to start but what a week myself and my partner had at the sol oasis Marrakech! Upon arrival we were met by friendly staff in reception who greeted us with a welcome drink whilst checking in. We were then shown to our room which was average size but more than enough space for two of us - it had a shower bathroom and a balcony. One tip would be there is a small window in the bathroom without a curtain/blind so cover this with a towel for privacy. The food and drink we couldn't complain...there was a pool bar which serves snacks (burgers etc) during the day and a frequent BBQ cooking fish and chicken which was perfect. Drinks wise, there are plentiful, ranging from local spirits and the beer is San Miguel in bottles (330ml). We took our own thermal cups which…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 August 2022,3,Expected better,"The hotel itself is nice. The staff are really friendly and helpful and the animation team are brilliant and work very hard. The hotel has a lot of potential but the service was not quite what we expected and we felt it was advertised in the wrong way. We came here with high expectations and we were disappointed when we arrived. It really needs to state it only has one restaurant as this leaves guests disappointed. We were told, other than the main buffet restaurant, one was open but you have to pay for it (which is fine) but it was never open to serve food. I am not even sure why it says there are 3 as another isn’t even an option. We stayed for 10 nights and it was pretty cheap overall, so I guess you get what you pay for. Pros Very clean Spacious and modern rooms Nice…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

The room was a perfect size and it was always clean.

 July 2022,5,Amazing Holiday,"We stayed at the Sol Oasis July 22 for seven nights. Our flight was delayed so we didn’t arrive until after midnight, normally you are greeted at reception upon arrival with a glass of sparkling to get your holiday started. The hotel rooms are a reasonable size, quaint and clean with traditional Moroccan style decor. Towels are replaced each day when the rooms are cleaned. The on-site facilities are very good. The pool is a good size and surrounded by gardens, the bar isn’t far from the pool. The hotel also has a football pitch, tennis, volleyball courts and archery area. All areas are well kept and cleaned regularly. Sol Oasis has everything that you could possibly hope for but the best thing is definitely the staff.

Pool area was lovely, never struggled to get a sun bed! The entertainment team were always friendly and encouraged you to get involved! I enjoyed my daily water aerobics! The one downfall for us was the noise when trying to sleep! The rooms are not sound proof at all, so if anyone walks past your window it is super loud! We were also in a ground floor room so the noise of the people in the room above us kept us awake sometimes. Would still recommend and return if we were to visits Marrakesh again, however next time we would ask for an upstairs room! We would also visit outside June - august as we soon realised July was…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

Plenty of activities in the day and cool chilled out live guitar music every night before the entertainment. Staff are amazing.

 June 2022,5,A lovely hotel with great staff!,"A very nice hotel on the outskirts of Marrekesh with lovely grounds. The room was spacious and clean with a Berber twist. Food was excellent quality and varied throughout the week. We agree with previous reviews that the staff make this hotel. The animation team were great and the evening entertainment was very professional. The shows in the theatre were a highlight. A particular mention goes to Hicham in the restaurant who was there with a smile every night and magically appeared to top up our glasses. Wi-fi was the best we've experienced in a hotel, being able to stream movies in HD without issue. The courtesy bus into the city centre was invaluable. We did have a couple of minor issues with the room on arrival, mainly low water pressure in the shower and a wobbly toilet.…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

The reason for picking this hotel was because of all the good reviews especially about the animation team especially sousou she was outstanding (she made a big impression on myself my husband Alan and my friends Claire and Dave).

 June 2022,5,Wonderful family holiday,"The hotel decor and surroundings are beautiful and spotlessly clean. All the staff made everything perfect for our stay. The food was fresh and delicious with a good amount of choice. The pool area was always clean and tidy, and the lifeguards can’t do enough to help. The only criticism is, we would have liked more background music during the day. Even though it’s a very relaxing environment, at times we could just hear children crying. The kids club was brilliant - Sou sou & Zizou are most definitely the 2nd mums of all the kids, and the kids pool area was alot of fun. The animation team made our holiday, such wonderful & incredibly hardworking people. We loved their continuous interaction with us and all of the evening entertainment.

The entertainment crew are fantastic, special mentions to Sam, Sousou, Russ and of course Michael and his moonwalk. The food and beverage team are great, special mention to Morshine and his amazing cocktails at the pool bar. All the F&B team make you feel welcome, Abdelilah in the restaurant made us such a difference. The rooms are great, the pool is fantastic and you don’t have leave the resort if you don’t need to. Highly recommend booking this resort, we certainly will when we return to Marrakesh.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 May 2022,5,Perfect half term get away,"Oasis perfectly describes this hotel. The surrounding area is dry and dusty, but the moment you walk through the huge doors you are greeted by a calm, tropical oasis. Our room was just right for a family of 4 (room 2621). The pool and the amount of activities on offer from tennis, archery, pickle ball, aqua aerobics - there is enough to keep everyone or all ages entertained. The gym is state of the art, free weights, running machines and even a TRX room and yoga classes. The food was amazing, the salads to die for, it was very easy to eat really healthily on this holiday. The highlight for us though was the staff, whether it was the bar staff with their friendly greetings, the waiters and waitresses with their attention to detail, they kept topping up our wine, or the…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

The entertainment team are so talented and lovely especially Niako! He is 1 in a million the kindest most sweetest soul. We would also like to thank Abelilah for the best service. Khalid was also the best pool guy ever! The reception team helped us book tours and excursions and the service was incredible. We have made memories that we will treasure forever.

 May 2022,5,Relaxing and great fun at the same time...,"The resort is just a 25 minute ride from the airport and the hotel and grounds are welcoming and very well kept. Our initial experience was good with a smooth check-in and our room was clean and well located although the balcony is small and not somewhere that you would spend much time. The food is very good although the resort would benefit from having an alternative location / menu on-site to mix things up. Best thing for us though are the people, bar staff Morcene and Rida but the animation team really made our stay very special..... Sousou, Zisou, Russ-E-Boy and the undeniably talented Sam. Big up to Arthur for making it all work. One point of note was that the hotel was much busier over the weekend. Would I go back - most definitely.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

In terms of the wait staff Soufane and Mehdi were so great too. I hope the management will speak to them to thank them for their work! The animation team had so much energy and made you feel like you were at home. I enjoyed archery with Niako, bellydancing with Nani and I loved the bollywood night in the theatre.

 May 2022,5,A perfect place for a great holiday,"Me&my friend stayed at Sol Oasis 29/04-03/05 (all inclusive). Everything was amazing about this hotel. We were checked in early and served some refreshing beverages upon arrival. It is not located centrally and it can be quite costly to get to the town centre to visit, but the staff will always help with travel recommendations and they also have a free shuttle service to the town centre twice a day. The food is nice, we always found something to our taste and we got to try the local cuisine too. It is true we did not make it a must for us to have exquisite food, so it was easy for us to be pleased by the menu. The room was really nice and so was the room service.

 April 2022,5,Excellent - friendly - clean,"I will start with just a couple of negatives. I booked a family xtra room and emailed reservations asking for a twin room with an additional single bed, I received confirmation from Mohamed that my request had been noted. On arrival we had a double bed with a sofa bed, I don’t like to complain so we had to deal with this, it didn’t feel like a good start. The food was amazing but there were lots of flies on everything, I feel that they should have more protection over the food especially in the warmer months, it did affect our choice of pastries as the stickiest were covered worse.

The entertainment team (Zizou, Sousou, Russ, Michael, Sam, Nani and Niako, Dounia the best choreography) always go the extra mile to make us smile every single day. Both Zizou and Sousou looked after our children as if they were their own. It's meant me and Jim could relax and enjoy being together which is rare on a family holiday!

Nothing is too much trouble in all departments. If you want to be entertained the animation team are fantastic but equally if you would rather be left in peace, that is respected too.

It is clear everyone who works at the resort takes pride in their job- whether it is to entertain in the children’s club, cook or keep it well maintained and clean. A free transfer to the souks, made going with small children easy. Thoroughly recommend to who anyone who wants to retreat with children yet have a bit of culture and relaxation as well. A hidden gem! Thank you, Sol Oasis.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 March 2022,5,Best holiday ever,"Honestly best holiday ever! We only caught a glimpse of the good weather but the best part of the holiday was definitely the staff and the hotel. They were all super welcoming and cheerful. However the best staff by far would’ve been the Animation team who were super interactive and always made sure everyone is having a good time, wether it was during the day with activities like games, such as archery or football , to evening entertainment such as themes shows that were amazing to watch every time. By the end of our stay we were sad to go as we really bonded with the people there. I would definitely recommend to destination to anyone and everyone.",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 March 2022,5,10/10. Would definitely come back!,I visited Sol Oasis last week with my mum and brother and we had the best time!

We will definitely be coming back to this hotel.,Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 March 2022,5,The best choice.,"Had the most amazing holiday at the Sol Oasis. It's a really well run hotel in truly beautiful and impressive grounds. The rooms are all totally renovated and immaculate.. What we particularly liked was the fact the buildings are only two storey so it's more like living in a small village with lots of stunning courtyards and fountains. We were lucky to stay for 4 weeks(basically chosen by the high trip advisor rating) Absolutely no complaints and the weather was perfect, most days around 25 degrees. The food was always varied, lots of opportunities to try Morrocan dishes as well as international.. Have to mention the cakes and pastries.. They were unbelievable.. The best thing about the hotel are the staff. The kindest, most helpful and genuine people we have ever met. The…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
 March 2022,5,Sol Oasis Marrakech,"A fantastic hotel. Very modern, stylish and immaculately clean! We spent 5 nights here on a family break and absolutely loved it. The hotel is a 25 min drive from the airport, and from the minute we arrived we were very impressed! Facilities within the hotel are superb; a huge outdoor pool and another indoor heated pool, gym facilities, tennis courts, basketball and volleyball courts all available to guests all day long. The restaurant and food served were excellent, with plenty of choices which varied every day! Whilst the facilities in the hotel were very impressive, special mention has to go to the staff.

 February 2022,5,Best Holiday Experience,"We had a 7 day all inclusive stay at the hotel and it was one of the best holiday experiences we’ve ever had. Marrakech in general was quiet due to covid restrictions so the hotel understandably wasn’t that busy, but that didn’t stop the team from making sure we had the most memorable experience. The food was amazing, afternoon lunch was a selection of fresh bbq dishes and mouth watering tagines, and evening dinner was again a mix of both traditional Moroccan dishes and other cuisines, we were spoilt for choice and often couldn’t decide what to eat. A special mention goes to Zuzu and Sisou from the kids club, both of whom gave so much love and attention to our young daughters that we found it hard to stay away from the hotel lol. It truly felt like we were all a big family…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech

 October 2021,5,The best holiday - highly recommend,"Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations. The hotel itself and the rooms are beautifully decorated, very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The hotel is situated outside the centre which we preferred as it was very peaceful, but there is also a shuttle that the hotel provides to travel into the city centre (although there was some confusion with organising this on one of the days). Our stay was all-inclusive and there was a wide range of tasty food options for each meal and the chefs and waiters/waitresses are very attentive and friendly - especially the Head Chef, as well as Ismail, Hachim behind the bar, and Noureddine who made us some amazing cocktails. Aside from the stunning setting and the facilities of the hotel, the main thing that made our…",Sol_Oasis,Marrakech
