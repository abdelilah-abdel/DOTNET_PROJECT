 December 2022,5,"Comfortable Central Accommodation...staffed with helpful, kind & friendly people","Maybe the hotel is 3-star but the 5-star rating from me is for Mohammed from breakfast as I promised! Also a big Thank-You & 5* to Ahmed my big man at reception and ichrak & karima who turned over cleaned my room. The bed was extremely comfortable.

 November 2022,3,Typical Ibis hotel in walking distance from station.,Walking distance from the station but a short taxi ride to other attractions. Perfectly fine - clean room - professional staff - breakfast a bit lacklustre. In short - a pretty typical Ibis hotel. I should add that we struggled to identify a good value hotel (with character) when planning our trip to Tangier so went with the safe Ibis option. It ticked the necessary boxes for us.,Ibis_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2022,3,Convenient for rail station - otherwise very unremarkable. Staff training needed.,"The room was OK. A bit less than most Ibis hotels, no soap at all, no bottled water, bedside table slightly broken. Bed comfortable. Great asset is that hotel is very close to rail station - just across the square. Staff are borderline unfriendly (great contrast with most Ibis where staff are jolly and welcoming). They were so sour that I did not take up the free drink but went across square to the Royal Tulip to have drink and dinner, They were Very professional. I did ask if they had a local map and was told to photo one on the wall!!! But I got one from the Royal Tulip Hotel next door.",Ibis_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2022,1,"Hard to find much good, I’m afraid","We decided to take the high speed train from Casablanca to Tangier with the intention of visiting Chefchaouen. We arrived at around 2:00 pm, checked in and spent the remainder of this first day seeing Tangier. It’s a lovely city! Then we woke up early the next day to meet our transfer to the Blue City. We returned to the Ibis and spent a second night. Basically, we were only there to sleep. This hotel was very small and bare boned. There were only two threadbare towels in our room and when we asked at 9 PM to get another towel, we were advised that housekeeping had gone home. We like to sleep with the window open and did so, but there is no screen on the huge window. (Very dangerous!). Did anyone know that mosquitoes can fly seven floors up? Lol. The bed had a 3-inch…",Ibis_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2022,4,Lots of value for the money !,"Great location, value for the money ! These Ibis hotels are located near so many central train stations, making it easier to get to and let’s you avoid the hassle of taking a taxi. The rooms are not luxury, but they are also very well priced, especially if you are travelling on vacation.

 September 2022,3,Okay value,"The good: -Hotel has a free underground parking (need to ask this at reception) -Friendly staff -Clean bed and room -Great location -Price The bad: -Horrible filthy pool (they don't even bother cleaning the pool area as its filled with bricks, sand, dirt and leafs inside and around the pool, nothing like in the photo) -Infrastructure is decaying and needs renovation (shower door didn't close well, light switches are loose,...) -Parking guys at the entrance of the hotel, why is this even allowed? And why is the reception not saying there is a free underground parking ?

 September 2022,4,very much enjoyed my stay,"Stayed here twice, one night before catching the train to Casablanca, then two nights when I returned a week later after my trip. I have absolutely no complaints. Staff was wonderful, the room was an Ibis room, simple and clean and with a good bed and good shower. Location is fantastic for taking trains, walking along the shore into town, shopping at the mall, and breakfast was fantastic (if you complain about the selection I really would like to come to your house for breakfast because it must be spectaculair).

 July 2022,1,avoid at any cost,I had an awful experience in this hotel. dirty and badly maintained. staff is not helpful. they sent the security guard to my room asking for the payment to be settled - never seen such thing and manners in any other hotels around the globe. I have been a long-time loyal customer of Ibis but due to this bad experience in this particular hotel I will never stay again with them in any part of the planet.

 April 2022,3,A standard 3 star hotel offering,"It was just OK in all fairness, pretty much what you expect from Ibis! The room was basic and could have been a bit cleaner but it was decent. The location for us was ideal as we just had a day in Tangier before getting the train so it was close and was good for the mall too and some western comforts. The room could have been cleaner and it would be nice to have a safe. Plug sockets were in awkward locations too which was annoying.

 February 2022,1,Bad,"Other than the cheap price and decent breakfast, this hotel is really bad. Rooms, elevators, and everything in the rooms are not cleaned, floors are sticky meaning that you can’t walk barefoot or with socks on, the view and the bed sucks, and none of the basic items were found in the room (no hand soap, no slippers, no safe, nothing).

 December 2019,3,Standard IBIS offering,"Went here on business. Generally it is OK but nothing out of the ordinary. As is also typical of an IBIS, the staff are generally unhelpful (it must be part of their training to be miserable and unhelpful). Rooms are ""ok"" but in need of some maintenance as they are looking a little tired. There is some building work in the area but thankfully the double glazing deadened the noise.

 August 2019,2,Don’t waste your money,"This is the worst Intl Branded hotel I have ever stayed in. The Front Desk is rude, lazy and incompetent, and the quality of the food and beverage is terrible. The staff spend a lot of time talking to each other, this includes when they are serving you. The physical hotel itself is fine for a select service hotel, clean and reasonably maintained (except one of the lifts was out of service 4 times during our 10 day stay). The room setup is so cheap, only a soap and a shampoo, nothing else. No glasses, cups, kettle, fridge, tea & coffee, pen & notepad, bottled water, nothing. And the towels and sheets have been used for so long they have gone a light grey colour and were thread bare. The housekeeping staff do work very hard and are happy to assist your requests.

To keep the room cool, I had no alternative but to put my Priority Pass membership card in the power slot when I went out. When I returned, the card was gone. I asked the front desk to check for me who made up my room that particular day and it must be her who took away my card. They were unable to identify who cleaned my room before I checked out on Monday morning. I have heard nothing from the hotel up until now.

The only problem being one of the beds which had a few wooden slats missing/broken and this wasn't fixed even after reporting it. Breakfast was pretty good.

 February 2019,2,"Location good, but hotel bad","The location is very good. It is just a few minutes' walk from the train station. The lobby is also quite pleasant looking and in line with when I have stayed at Hotel Ibis in various European cities. However, the rooms bear no resemblance to the European Hotel Ibis rooms, which are quite nice. The room was very rundown and the bed was rock hard.

 September 2018,1,Smell of Sewage,"Even though our previous experience was dire, we thought we will try again. We asked for a nice room as per poor experience last time. We didn’t sleep till 5am because of sewage and burning smell. It was vile. We went for breakfast, no staff to be seen in the restaurant at 8.15 am but guests having their breakfast. We went to reception to ask if anybody was working in the restaurant. Eventually this woman came out to make Moroccan bread and looked at us as if she was doing us a favour. Waste of money ! As a silver card holder of Accorhotels we got no previledges. Reception manager not bothered and general manager non existent. I wouldn’t stay here again even if it was free.

 June 2018,2,"Poor, unprofessional desk staff","Been several times in different IBIS hotels worldwide. This was a first - experienced a very uncomfortable situation, showing the lack of tact, discretion and professionalism of the desk clerk. Went with 3 female friends who checked-in prior to my arrival. While returning with one of my female friends who had checked-in earlier in her own room, I was asked /doube-checked about her name, her room number etc. I find it appauling that they dont know which guests are checked in, and when not knowing, - ask other guests for their information!

 November 2017,4,"Nice, clean Hotel","I stayed here for a week and would do it again. It is a basic hotel, clean, good location, close to the train station and mall, one block to the Boulevard with plenty of restaurants and fast foos stores and 2 blocks to the beautiful beach. The Rooms are sufficient, not the biggest around, but you basically only stay here to sleep, so it is fine. A fridge was missing, maybe that is something management should be considering adding. A highlight here is for sure breakfast that is complimentary and avail until 10.30am. It was really good, especially the baguette, fresh and tasty! After 10.30am, there is still a snack buffet avail until noon. A special thanks to the barstaff that were incredible, friendly and funny. I loved to end my evening with the beautiful staff here.

When you get off the boat you will be approached by several guides. We used a guide called Achmed they don't talk about money you just tip them what you think. We found him invaluable and he keeps all the street traders off of you as well and he takes you to what you want to see. Back to the Ibis. Standard rooms as over in the uk.

I hang the towel so that the hotel does not have to change the towel as it is written there to save the trees but stiil they change the towel with the new one, everyday. I am ok with the breakfast.

It is also just as close to the Tanger City Mall that has a supermarket as well as shops and restaurants for all tastes. You can also find buses and taxis nearby. I asked for a calm room and I was disturbed by intense noise in the evening coming from cars in the boulevard, it lasts for hours (not the hotel's fault but I wish I was warned). The room was approximately clean but small. Cleaning ladies are easily distracted by each other, and the result is: dirty elements are forgotten in the room, and used hygiene items are not even replaced.

Pleasant staff who spoke English, Spanish & French. Rooms were basic, nothing fancy. This hotel's location is key, being only a 5-10min walk away from the station. And only a 5min walk to the nearest shopping mall (to buy SIM cards, supermarkets, etc) and a 15min walk to the beachside promenade where you can see camels on the beaches and restaurants to dine at.

We had to reset it 4 times in one day because it stopped working. Breakfast wasn't great. There is no iron. If you want to iron your clothes you need to pay. They don't give you enough towels. The bed is high and difficult to get onto if you have any disability or pregnant. Bad lighting in the rooms (makeup issues).

The hotel isolates from the old city area which means you can have an peaceful night. No beggars in front of your hotel entrance or surrounding area. Since the entrance of the hotel is protected by G4S . In addition, the area is protected by military forces and you could hardly found any dangerous from this area where it's a huge difference compare to the old city area.

 December 2015,1,Bug infested rooms - best to avoid!,Stayed for a couple of nights. Was unable to sleep and kept awake due to bug bites. Called reception and they said there was nothing they could do. Came down finally at 3am and after having to shout at reception staff they found another room for me to complete the night. Really poor customer service - they simply couldn't care less. No compensation or reduction in rate.

No answer when calling reception.

 December 2015,5,Great nights sleep and fantastic value for money.,"We found all the staff (without exception) to be courteous, friendly, professional and approachable at all times. Breakfast was both plentiful and enjoyable. We spent 8 marvelous days in Tangier at this hotel, we slept exceptionally well each night. I would definitely not hesitate to return to this hotel again in the future. If I had to find any fault regarding this hotel, it would be regarding location alone, it is located a short petit taxi ride (approx 15 drms) to a greater selection of restaurants.",Ibis_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Tanger_City_Center_Hotel,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 October 2015,3,Unexpected Expenses!,"My friend booked this hotel for a twin room in advance for our trip to Tangier, Morocco. When we arrived at the hotel, we were informed that there are no more twin rooms available. What the hotel staff suggested is to put an extra mattress on the floor for the other person to sleep on. This did not go down well. It was not nice to be treated like one of you is a slave and the other is the master. The thing is, a guest does not expect this kind of insensitivity especially after figuring out in a vehicular accident that delayed the trip by five hours, both with headaches and has no strength to argue our rights at that point. The hotel's own policy is to ensure guests satisfaction and if not achieved, they will go out of their way to achieve customr satisfaction.

 September 2015,3,Not good,"눉I stayed here because I thought I would be able to easily walk to the train station the next morning. WRONG. No footpaths, no light controlled crossings and just far too dangerous to consider. Do far better to stay near the old Medina. The wifi was truly terrible. Hours on end it did not work and when it did very slow. The bathroom was not clean and the basin plug could not be easily removed as the control was bent and useless. The towels were small, thin and grey. The food in the restaurant was appalling. I ordered an entrecote cooked medium rare, turned up done like boot leather so back it went. No easy choices for food close by. The breakfast was poor value and only Earl Grey tea bags available.

 January 2015,4,A good place in an amazing city,I'm a Moroccan and I live in a city near Tanger so I didn't expect anything special in my period of staying in Tanger. but I was wrong because staying at that Hotel is definitely a good thing to do. The hotel has a great service in the Bar and the staff is kind of nice too. The breakfast is served early but it's really amazing. And even the look from outside is amazing.

 January 2015,4,Nice hotel in a nice city,"The hotel is good, typical new Ibis. It has pleasant and big reception area, wi-fi, clean rooms. The breakfast was good, the personnel were nice and helpful. The hotel is situated close to the railway station (you can walk there), it was convenient for us, as we arrived in Tangier from Rabat by train. The hotel is also not far from the bus station (we took a taxi there, as we were going to Chefchaouen by bus). To the beach you can walk for about 10 min; if you're going to the old city, it takes 25-30 minutes on foot. We had a very nice impression of the city and the hotel.

 April 2015,4,Typical IBIS Hotel,"If you have stayed at a Ibis Hotel, it looks very similar. The room are clean and tidy but they need thicker wall. You can heard the rooms next door and what ever is going in the hall. If you are a light sleeper ask to be in the most quiet room possible. Breakfast is a buffet, aka English breakfast with French pastries. The food is fresh and nice, the service is great.

 April 2015,4,No complaints,Nice room nice staff hospitality was good and had a good night sleep here. Only thing which stopped me from giving it a 5 was the amount of women who were clearly not staying at the hotel were entering and it seemed like they were escorts.

 April 2015,1,Very bad service,"I really dont know what to start with. Very noisy room 405 facing west even in the fourth floor. The WiFi code was expired. We had to call again to get another code. I tried to take a shower and guess what, only three towels, medium size and so not soft. The big discovery was hair everywhere on the shower walls. I dont think they bother themselves to clean the shower walls. Water is not hot. It is only warm. At the bed headboard there is multiple oily spots. The white bed comforter has a black shoe print.

 December 2014,1,Scam artists and crooks,"The hotel is overall nice and fairly new, with small European style rooms and cheaply built. The staff though are all crooks and scam artists. The Ibis is very close to the train station which is really convenient, however there are much better hotels that are only a cheap grand taxi away. When asking about transport to Tangier Med the front desk staff (we asked three separate ones) said the only way possible to get there was by a grand taxi 400 MAD and since we were six we would need to grande taxis so 800MAD, When we asked about the train (which is why we stayed at this hotel) they said there was nor, and when we questioned it they stated that they were sure that there is no train or bus and a grand taxi was the only way.

 February 2015,2,Just ok,"Stayed one night. Checkin was fairly fast. The lobby was nice. The room not so nice. There were streaks of some type of liquid on the wall, it was cold in the room due to Acorr's commitment to reduce energy at the expense of its guests. Free wifi and breakfast.

 December 2014,4,Good choice to escape the city bustle,This is your standard IBIS hotel which can be a relief after too many Riads. This hotel is near to the train station and about 40 minutes walk from the town centre (or 8 Dihrams in a taxi). There is a strip of restaurants on the beach nearby so lots of food choices. Avoid the expensive breakfast and go out for better choice and cheaper prices.

It's a while since I have been to Morocco and I am always a little dubious when in developing countries. I must admit though the standards of good and drink were top quality.

Also, if you look closely at the parquet floor, you will see that it is a bit dirty (the wood comes in a dark color so it's convenient not to clean it!!!).

Overall good stay, the room could have been cleaner but would go back again. Positives: Price (that's why I stayed there and not in more expensive place!), location (quiet area yet close to beach area and longish walk to Medina and Kasba but taxis are cheap and I like walking. It is true, there are a lot of construction sites around them but never heard noise or felt unsafe, maybe a lot of dust but you can keep the windows closed). Bed was great and staff overall very friendly and helpful.

 August 2013,1,Terrible experience from the staffs' side!!!,"Starting on a good note, average hotel with good location. To add, few of the staffs indeed were polite and helpful. But what ruined my stay was the other few staffs who totally do not know what service basically means. My friends who are African American were turned back saying there is no room available. And less then 10 mins we got a room without any trouble. The display sign says one price and what they charged us was way too much than what we were told in the phone. I asked to talk to the manager who ""was not there"". I asked if they have room service and the guy after realising its my first time in Morocco was like, well there is no room service but m willing to give you one. One of my friends was even invited to go to the beach.

The rooms and bathrooms were small and everything had a ""budget"" feel to it. The breakfast was average. The service from the hotel staff was atrocious. We had booked a bed and breakfast rate for our family of 4 but the staff argued with us that we did not have breakfast included in our rate. We had to show them our email confirmation before they believed us. We also asked for 2 connecting rooms because we have 2 kids.

 April 2013,3,Disappointing.,"The Ibis city centre is convenient in that it is near the train station in Tangier. However, the environs of the hotel resemble a business park and it is a fair walk to the seafront and restaurants. The hotel is a relatively modern Ibis. The rooms are typical Ibis. They are small and comfortable. We were surprised that the man on reception was very rude to us. The room he gave us was badly prepared. There was a wet towel lying beside the bed and no clean towels in the bathroom. The bed appeared to have been made in a rush. When we asked for another room, the man on the desk told us that we could not have one as we had not complained within seven minutes of arriving in the room. Incredible!

I would not recommend Tangier for more than 1 night and the medina is no where as good as what you find in Marrakesh or Fez. If you are travelling by ferry to Algerceris make sure it is from the port located in the old city centre otherwise you will have to pay US$20-$30 for a taxi to the other port.

Thus, if you shower at night, expect to use the same damp towel next morning. In fact, if you ask for 2 more towels, they will only bring you 1 more, even if there are two guests in the room because is their policy.
