 January 2023,5,Allegro hotel Agadir. Good location with friendly stuff.,"Hotel is really great. People at the hotel are amazing and really helpful, ready to solve all the problems. Animations during my stay were really great. The most amazing guys from animators are Tito and Medi. Fun all the time. Food is good, only one remark is that more salt and pepper should be added to the food. Rooms are clean and checked every day. If you want to spend a good time and relax, it's a really good place to stay."
 August 2021,5,Amazing stay,"Our stay at hotel allegro was amazing. The staff is really nice, respectful, and welcoming. They bring a fresh and new perspective of animation to the hotel and at night it’s so funny and amazing how they make every person comfortable it’s just wow. I have never felt this comfortable at a hotel. The food is really good and there is something for everyone. Mohamed is part of the staff and helped us with anything that we needed throughout our stay. He has been really helpful and comprehensive with anything that my family and I needed. The hotel is next to the beach, they also have a private beach that is clean and there is not anybody that disturbs you there. It’s located in a perfect location.

 January 2023,5,Fantastic - Highly Recommend :),"The hotel was fantastic, staff were very nice, attentive and welcoming! Food was incredible with a huge cooked buffet featuring different food everyday, with very diverse and authentic options. Drinks were available the whole day and you were supplied with a full bottle of water at each meal. The beach with security and was only a 2 minute walk across the street and fantastic for relaxing. All staff were English speaking and never stopped smiling. The room was lovely and shower was great Overall 10/10 and would recommend to anyone especially at the all-inclusive price."

 December 2022,5,Highly recommend this hotel,Modern rooms - beds made every day along with clean towels. Fantastic food & drink - lots of variety and very tasty. Served all variety of wine which wasn't bad at all and the variety of drinks at the bar was very good. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. We will be coming back!

I was looking forward to taking my family here but overall disappointed will definitely book elsewhere next time
 October 2022,5,Amazing experience,"I stayed here in recently and had the best experience I could ask for. The food was amazing, there was a big variety for everyone to chose from. The staff was so friendly, helpful and funny and made our trip even better. The management were always seen around the hotel, keeping an eye on things. We felt completely safe and had no worries, and could enjoy our trip to the fullest. I definitely plan to come back, thank you to Mohamed and the rest of the staff for giving us an amazing experience."

This particular incident soured our experience but didn’t stop us from enjoying ourselves. We really did have an amazing time and probably will come back. Hotel had a Loveholidays representative, Fouad, who was there daily. Presenting and organising excursions activities for us.

 January 2023,1,Great Rooms / Terrible Food,"Wonderful clean modern rooms, with huge comfortable beds. Very attentive happy staff however the food is terrible. There are plenty of great restaurants nearby so that’s not an issue unless you are on a budget. As a room only hotel it would have been great however all went very sour when we tried to leave, despite paying our bill for the taxes on check out the security literally held my wife hostage and would not allow us to walk out the hotel. The manager was great and sorted the situation but it ruined our experience and we will never return. For £5 a night extra there are much better hotels and you won’t have to eat out on all inclusive. I hate having to leave a negative review but it is deserved in this instance. Avoid!"
 December 2022,4,Allegro is All Good,"Spent a quick 4 days and was impressed by both Agadir and Allegro. It had been 27 years since our last stay in Agadir. While the hotel has changed hands. The Barcelo chain has done a great job of preserving and updating the charm. Can't say enough nice things about the stay. Staff was attentive, food was good and varied room was updated and comfortable. It's location is great for beach and center souks. Wifi was strong. Will come back, not wait 27 years this time."
 December 2022,4,Excellent Holiday,"We visited for one week in December and had such a great time. I had read a few poor reviews but honestly can’t understand them now having been. The room was huge, spotlessly clean with a beautiful private terrace. The cleaners were lovely and changed towels daily and cleaned. The entertainment staff were so friendly! All of the staff were fantastic. Great food on offer too. The snack bar was a little bit too much of the same every day, but not a big problem. We really did have such a great holiday, we did several tours/ activities and they were all worth it. We are actually returning in February. 6 weeks to go!"
 December 2022,4,Good hotel for families with young children,Good hotel in a very good location with all good restaurants and shops nearby. Recently refurbished bedrooms are very nice and comfortable though on the small side. Honest taxi drivers who don't try to rip you off like in Marrakech
 December 2022,5,Lovely chill at Allegro,"Agree with the people who praise the enthusiastic and caring hotel staff. Forgive the slow check in and the corridors. Rooms are great and the food is very high quality and tasty. Thanks for giving us Christmas. Foad at Bravo organises some great trips and cares but do ask for exact itinerary and expect to tip widely. Soukina is the loveliest waitress and Rahammed the lifeguard will jump in fully clothed. Beach is semi private but pool is more hassle free. Surrounding area is safe but just be aware that you look like a tourist! High police presence. Hotel staff high integrity, so don't worry if you forget to lock up.Will definitely repeat."
 December 2022,5,Highly recommend,"Came here for my birthday and didn’t disappoint. Most friendly staff out of hotels I’ve been to, making sure we was having a good time and very helpful. From the bedrooms to the reception and pool area everything was kept very clean constantly. Plenty of food to choose from at breakfast, lunch and dinner to cater for everyone. Activities throughout the day which you are able to take part in and entertainment was a good laugh in the evening. Booking excursions we wanted to do was simple and we was able to book trips through the hotel to ensure you that it’s safe, professional (not a scam) and was also a great price for them. Would strongly recommend and would certainly go back!"
 December 2022,5,First Trip to Morocco!,"For the price we payed, this hotel was outstanding and far exceeded our expectations. When we arrived, we were met by the hotel rep Fouad, who I must say was kind and helpful throughout our trip. Although we arrived at 9:30pm, we were taken down to dinner where there was a full buffet of local and western delights. Soft drinks, beers, wine and water is available at lunch and dinner and this is when you can access your free bottled water. Fresh juices and hot drinks are available at breakfast, although you are able to go to the bar and have hot drinks whenever you want. Oh also the famous Moroccan mint tea is available at breakfast which is to die for! We found lunch times to be fairly repetitive but there was still a wide variety of food, including freshly baked pizzas. These…"

 December 2022,4,"Great stay, great holiday!",Fouad was the real highlight of the trip! He helped organise our holiday and we were really looked after! The hotel was nice and the private balcony was a lovely touch! When we had issues the staff was on hand to help.
 December 2022,5,My experience from Allegro Agadir,"I recommend hotel Allegro Agadir. The beach is really near, you need to go out from the hotel and you are:) Staff is friendly, location is perfect, swimming pool is heated, food is okey, a lot of shops around. I really recommend! If I go to Agadir again, I choose this hotel."
 December 2022,2,Didn’t meet my expectations,"I came here with my family looking for a very fun and relaxing holiday. Firstly the hotel states online that it has gym and spa facilities, and we were very disappointed to find out that there were none on site, especially as a 4 star hotel. Secondly, the food was really not up to standard. Food was bland, and very similar every single day. Not much variation, dessert options were also terrible. Breakfast was exactly the same every day and no options for fresh juices, despite being in a 4 star hotel in a tropical country like morocco. The worst things that occurred at this hotel is that the hygiene was not up to standard. We noticed that bed sheets were not being changed every day, my mother developed an eye infection and a rash on her face, and we had to ASK reception to…"
 December 2022,5,Excellent Family Holiday,"3 adults and 2 children enjoyed a 4 night all inclusive stay from Saturday 10/12/22 to Wednesday 14/12/22. The resort is huge and spotlessly clean. The staff are all very welcoming and helpful. Could find nothing to complain about whatsoever so not sure about some of the bad reviews on here. Food is varied and more than good enough. For the price we paid, £200 per head for flights, transfers and all inclusive hotel it was an absolute bargain. Rooms are spacious, with hairdryer, mini fridge and safe as standard. Cleaners are always cleaning. Swimming pool area is spacious and clean with plenty of activities for everyone and the entertainment team make a real effort to make everyone feel included. Ignore the bad reviews and try for yourself. Im fair with my reviews and have…"
 November 2022,5,Fantastic Birthday Holiday.,The best holiday ever. The hotel was amazing. The food fabulous and the staff absolutely outstanding. The entertainment team were brilliant. Rooms were lovely and clean and nothing was too much trouble. It was my birthday and was made so special by everyone. I cannot thank everyone for such an amazing stay. I cannot wait to come back in 2023. Loved Loved Loved our stay.
 December 2022,5,First Family Holiday,"We visited Allegro end of November to beginning of December and we had an amazing time. Everyone was extremely friendly, the food was good and the service was great. Our Holiday Rep, Fouad, was great at sorting all our activities and took care of us throughout"
 December 2022,5,Excellent stay. Good value,Excellent stay. Can only mirror image Suzanne H review would recommend this hotel. The only fault was the outside lighting early mornings and late night from 2200 block. Food and drink and great staff makes it good as you will get
 December 2022,5,Just Heavenly,"Just had 5 days at this hotel. It is perfect. Spotlessly clean! Food is amazing and I am a Very fussy eater but always had something different and the cakes are amazing. My bed was 8” 10 wide and the most comfortable bed ever! Room was cleaned with fresh towels everyday. Staff are lovely. Wi fi is free and the best I have ever had, and I travel a lot. Not much to do in the area but plenty of cheap excursions available. The only fault I could find is that the area coming out of accommodation has no lighting in morning and night when it was dark so stairs were a bit precarious. Would def return ……Thank you!"
 December 2022,5,Fun and relaxing,"Just back from our 2nd Visit to the Allegro. We enjoyed it that much we are planning to return for our next winter holiday. Since our 1st visit the hotel has been modernised it’s clean fresh and very modern. The rooms are lovely cleaned with fresh towels daily. The restaurant has a great selection of mouthwatering dishes and there’s always a great selection to choose from, we never failed to find something, the restaurant staff are quick and efficient placing water and wine down and clearing plates away. The pool is well tended with a fresh water pool, a children’s pool also a round heated pool. Entertainment staff are around day and night talking to guests, putting on activities throughout the day and evening ether around the pool the sports bar/night club where there…"
 November 2022,4,An excellent holiday,"This is a nice hotel, with (2 exceptions) wonderfully friendly staff. Special mention to Mohammad the manager - ever smiling and helpful. In The Lobby Bar, special mention to Ali - a real gentleman and full of fun, El Torro (he'll know) also really pleasant and full of fun, the young lady who worked there, she seemed to overcome her shyness as the week progressed. Also, the little guy who mopped the floor in the bar, shy, kind and always smiling. I gave 4 stars, I'd have given 5 had the food been served at an acceptable temperature. Food, which should be served hot, was consistently cold. I complained to Teresa, who seemed to take my complaint personally, not clever when working with people. The guy who we spoke to about excursions was NOT helpful when I asked him not to put his…"

 November 2022,5,Fantastic place with amazing people,"Amazing place with amazing atmosphere! We spent a wonderful week there! We felt very comfortable in the hotel. Two steps to the beach, with an exotic view. Every day we got fresh and delicious food, everything was prepared cleanly and with great care. Mr. Mohamed - the hotel manager was the most helpful person. He was really everywhere to help with anything we needed. He and Mrs. Teresa were there every day with a sunny smile, open minds to help with any problems or questions. Thanks to people like them, every day was amazing! Bravo Team with Ayoub DJ did a very professional and really nice job with different animations, every day all day long and every night, near the swimming pool to keep us happy. All hotel staff were respectful, helpful and accommodating. We even made…"

 November 2022,5,Great memories of a great hotel.,"I can’t praise this hotel enough. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome. The staff is so friendly and attentive. The rooms are wonderful, exceptionally clean and comfortable. The bed linen and towels always lovely and fresh. The standard of food at every meal was top notch, delicious and varied. The bar service is excellent. The wine and beer is very good and although the spirits are local, the mixers are top brands. Cocktails are very good too. The entertainment was great. The animation team are wonderful. We’re not ones for joining in everything but it was very entertaining. The team are so friendly and dedicated. They really enjoy their work and make a great team. The pool is beautiful, although a bit chilly, we did visit in November, it is clean and safe. Everywhere…"
 November 2022,5,Fantastic - can't recommend this amazing little gem enough (and can't understand any bad reviews),"Firstly - i dont normally write reviews and am not someone who enthuses about much, but wanted to make sure that this Hotel got the praise it deserves. After reading a couple of poor reviews from November (when we went) - I honestly cannot understand how our experiences were so different, my friend and I (& everyone we spoke to at the hotel) had a fabulous break and genuinely would recommend Allegro, Agadir to anyone. I booked onto this All-inclusive holiday with Love Holidays last minute, joining my friend for her 40th. I was going mainly to enjoy the sun (i'd been unwell for over a year and was just beginning to recover) and as the holiday cost so little I didn;t have many expectations. I couldn't have been more surprised with the fantastic week I ended up having. We…"
 November 2022,5,Allegro Agadir,The experience was ok and we had fun with different activities the city can provide it’s chilling and the weather is cool because the hotel is close to the sea They have a rep Holliday Fouad and he was helpful with planning all my activities and he personally drove me to a restaurant where I can try international food
 November 2022,5,Agadir Experience,"Would highly recommend this hotel. It is in a good location, near the beach front promenade, where there is a private beach area for the exclusive use of hotel guests. The hotel was kept very clean. All the staff were very friendly. We very much enjoyed the morrocan style food which may not be to everyone's taste. We were very happy with our stay and intend to go again to this hotel next year."
 November 2022,5,A lovely relaxing vacation,"Just a few words to say that we had a lovely time staying at the Allegro for four weeks. The room was very clean and comfortable and the cleaner ladies did a good job every day to clean and freshen it up. In the restaurant every day there was a good selection of delicious food, beverages and fresh fruit and vegetables for all three meals. All the waiters in the restaurant were very polite and courteous, but sorry to say We can not mention any by name, as we were served by many different waiters. The bar staff on the 3rd floor were very good and helpful, especially Abder, Kaoutar and Mohamed. All your managers do a great job to make each and every guest feel relaxed and have great time. Ali, Fouad and Mohammed were in regular touch almost every day to find out if everything was…"
 November 2022,5,Cracking 4 Star all inclusive offering 5 Star Experience,"Got this all inclusive holiday to Agadir, Morocco as it was in mid November and at a bargain price. Never been to Morocco before but the reviews for Agadir were gene positive so I too a gamble. It was an EasyJet Holiday and from the outset until our airport minibus transfer dropped us at the foyer of the Allegro Hotel everything went like clockwork. From the beginning to the end of our outstanding holiday the staff - waiters, bar staff, entertainments, cleaning and reception couldn't do enough to ensure we had a amazing holiday. Agadir is a beautiful coastal seaside town with 5 star beaches and a beautiful esplanade with bars, cafes, restaurants and shops. We essentially wanted a relaxing holiday but managed to include a camel ride, visit to Crocopark, cable car to the Kasabah…"
 November 2022,5,Great relaxing break,"I was not expecting much as only paid £268 pp via love holidays for all inclusive with flights and private transfers. I was pleasantly surprised . Rooms are large and cleaned every day , food although as not as much selection as you get in turkey etc was always very tasty and of a good quality tagines , salads , pasta ,fresh bread , vegetables etc they even cater for beige eaters with pizza , chips and plain pasta available every night. Pools were nice in mid November and the small middle one was heated . Wi-Fi was excellent all over the hotel. Late check out was only £23 per room which I thought was good. Good location and we walked everywhere as marina was only a 35 min walk. Found the drinks to be good and stronger than other all inclusive hotels I’ve stayed in. …"
 November 2022,2,Awful. Rude. Don’t bother.,"This hotel is a 3 star at best. I definitely won’t be returning. It’s put me off Agadir altogether. Positives : the bed was comfy. Negatives : the cleaning of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired. The hotel staff on reception are rude. So is the management. The hotel rep took attitude when I didn’t want to attend the welcome meeting and said he couldn’t protect me? Whatever that means. The food is awful, Luke warm at best. We were served raw burgers?! The food at the snack bar is horrendous. Some kind of ‘meat’ nugget, Fries and pizza but it’s all tasteless. You can’t have fun by the pool - no jumping in, diving, messing about, no ball games, no drinks anywhere near the pool. Management film people ‘misbehaving’ then refuse to delete the footage. Also considering it should…"
 November 2022,3,Not a bad hotel.,"The hotel rep (Faud) is very helpful. The reception messed up our check in and we had to wait extra 2 hours. Given a stupid explanation and no apology. Upon check out we asked for the 2 hours back so we could check out later, they didn't attempt to compromise and told us that we will make others late and that its people like us who cause this. Makes no sense as if they fixed this issue in the first place we wouldn't have been late to check in, blamed us for their incompetence. Still no apology after all this. Other than that, hotel is clean, breakfast is okay, cleaners are good. The pool is nice, daytime entertainment is good, drinks are nice. Room is a nice modern design, nice shower water pressure etc. Bed is comfy and just a nice overall room for the price. Hotel is in a…"
 November 2022,5,Lovely hotel,We have just come back from this lovely hotel after a weeks stay. The staff were so friendly and helpful they couldn't do enough for you. The room was really nice so clean it was cleaned every day with clean towels .the food was really nice plenty of choice .the pool area was lovely always plenty of sun beds .The location was excellent 2 mins to the hotels private beach and a short walk to all the shops and restaurants. Would definitely recommend to family and friends what a lovely holiday.
 November 2022,5,Allegro Agadir - family of 5,"staff are so lovely and attentive ive come with my family of 5 including a 6 year old and theres a childrens club and feels very safe. Great hospitality and service and also great food. The excursions are planned with the hotel and it is very safe and at a very good price too. The staff are very humble and incredibly active and want you to join in with all their activities which include pool aerobics, darts, archery, ping pong etc Plenty of snack and drinks too."
 November 2022,3,Disappointed,Hotel is very clean.room nice massive bed no iron. No tea coffee available in the room empty mini bar . The bar staff entertainment staff and restaurant staff all very friendly and go out of their way to please you. The food is awful the meat fatty and boney. I found it hard to find anything I liked and lived off cheese ( rubbery ) and salad . Not a lot of choices food wise and for an all inclusive we found it very poor. We had better in Cuba witch is a great achievement. Reception staff were curt and didn’t give us any information what so ever. We found the private section of the beach ourselves by accident .. bars close at 11 but there is a nightclub you can go to I don’t know what it’s like as we didn’t try it. Snack bar closes at 6 pm pizza nuggets or chips all wilted.…
 November 2022,5,Great Service,"Had a good service from Fouad, very friendly and helpful, make sure to ask for him. He booked our activities and was at hand for any issues or questions at all times.

 November 2022,5,Fabulous week of winter sun,"We stayed here for a week in November. The weather was amazing. The hotel is in a great location, with great access to a private section of the beach. The hotel is spotless, the staff and continually cleaning. The All-inclusive was great, plenty of choice of food and drinks. The staff work so hard at this hotel and are an absolute credit. Our first visit and we really enjoyed it and will definitely return. They say you get what you pay for in life, well you get what you pay for and a little bit more here."
 November 2022,5,Amazing holiday,"We have just returned after a weeks stay. Hotel very clean and modern. Great location with bars and restaurants nearby, food was great and there was so much! The staff were so friendly especially the entertainment team! By far the best in any hotel I have visited"
 November 2022,2,A totally honest review,"I have read a lot of these reviews and peoples take on this hotel , what I will give is a totally honest review of the place which is complete fact . Positives Snack bar DRINKS staff are absolutely lovely , super friendly and always happy to help - cannot fault . Animation team - shout out to Fouzi - truly wonderful people , they word tirelessly and are always smiling . Weather - faultless - however this isn’t a pro for the hotel but about the only other positive I can put on the list . CONS Reception staff - rude , unhelpful , disinterested and don’t care to explain in a nice manner ( when you’ve never been before to Morroco) what the tax means that all tourists have to pay the hotel . Food - in all honesty the smallest selection/choice of food for a pretty full…"
 November 2022,5,Best hotel in agadir 100%,"Very good service in the allegro hotel. Very good food and good activities in the hotel. Fouad and Mohmaed manager very helpful. Rooms are very clean and nice and hotel is close to the beach. See you next time allegro, we coming back again!"
 November 2022,4,Short break in the sun,This hotel was fine for what we needed as a short stay for much needed sunshine. The 2 small bars that facilitate the whole hotel are definitely not large enough and although the hotel wasn’t extremely busy they struggled so would hate to be here when it’s busy. I booked because of the heated pools but they definitely were not heated although cold they were lovely and just what we needed to cool down. Saying that I would think the busier times would be a nightmare with lack of space for large numbers. The music at the pool was ok for us but extremely loud. We only stayed at the pool on our last day as we preferred the private beach section to totally unwind. Our room was large and had the biggest bed I’ve ever slept in and was very comfortable. The shower was good and the room…
 November 2022,3,Wouldn’t recommend,"Before I say anything, every bad review I have read have the same issues and you will see that we have experienced the same - it is clear that the hotel have made no attempt to resolve these issues. On arrival at the hotel (around 3:30pm), the lobby was nice however it was chaotic trying to check in - staff on desk were slow and kept my passport. It wasn’t until we got to the room and had unpacked, that I realised-which was when I went to reception, to be told they have it without any reasoning behind it - it caused me a lot of anxiety in those moments. The room was hard to find - staff just sent us in a lift which didn’t lead to where our room was.. it turned out we were in a different block- how were we meant to know this? We asked a gardener outside to help us which I felt…"
 November 2022,5,Agadir Allegro,"Absolutely fabulous staff, so helpful especially Fouad and honestly he could not do enough for us, my partner had a bad incident with a camel from a uninsured guy who claimed it was very good however the camel fell on us and injured my partners leg. When we mentioned it to the staff they took us to hospital and made sure we was sorted. They honestly went above and beyond. Could not recommend enough!!!"

 November 2022,5,"Great hotel, Good food, Friendly, helpful staff, by the beach, and great value for money.","Great location, a 2 minute walk from an excellent beach. Staff at the hotel, from the guy at the beach, to the bar staff, catering staff, animation team, reception, and Mohamad were outstanding. Friendly and helpful, made our stay a very enjoyable experience. Nothing was too much trouble. Room was cleaned every day, the all inclusive option was excellent, lots of choice, catering for anyones requirements, and drinks were as per most AI, local included, and pay extra for imported. Staff were always cleaning or tending gardens etc around the hotel. Booking excursions with Fouad was easy, not overpriced, and he was always on hand if anyone had any questions. Mohamad was excellent, always a smile on his face, and always enquired if everything was ok, and seemed to be everywhere…"

 November 2022,5,Jumbo Tours,It was a great experience in Agadir especially with Fouad who gave us the best tour experience. I will rate his tours 5 star. If you want to feel safe and have the best time of your holiday Fouad is the man. I definitely come back to Allegro Agadir with the rest of my family.
 October 2022,1,MISOGYNIST STAFF!!!!,"IF YOU ARE A MIX RACE MOROCCAN WOMAN COMING FROM ABROAD, YOU WILL FEEL LIKE GOING BACK TO THE 50s! AVOID AT ALL COST! MISOGYNIST STAFF MEMBER!!!! My partner arrived from London a couple of days before me and the day before my arrival he went to reception and informed a receptionist of my arrival for the next day. The Receptionist gave him the bracelet and that was it. The day of my arrival my partner forgot to bring the bracelet so once we arrived at the hotel someone, that I assume was a security, asked me for it but we explained that my partner left it in the room and he was going quickly to grab it. Security said it was okay so my partner left. While I was standing there waiting for my partner, I started speaking in Arabic with the ‘porter’ and I told him that my mom…"
 November 2022,5,Anna,Stayed at the Allegro must say first time abroad and fouad has made our stay amazing. Everything we have needed he has helped with. Even when I ran out of vapes he went above and beyond to make sure I got another one. Highly recommend the hotel nice rooms comfy bed. Food is good food variety for every diet. Entertainment ok more better towards the end of our stay. It's nice to see managers of hotel walking around the resort. All the staff are very friendly. And the excrusions are highly recommended and a very good price. Don't want to come home but unfortunately our week has ended. Big up Allegro hotel
 November 2022,4,Had a nice time!,"x2 Adults and x1 baby Room: 1238 Flights, travel and all inclusive for 1 week: £900 As you do, I read some of the reviews on here prior to visiting paying particular attention to the negative ones written within the last couple of months. I have to say, there must be some really fussy people out there who wrote those reviews. It’s not as bad as they make out. Room Has two singles beds pushed together creating a king. Has been modernised with a decent size TV, a fridge, a free safe, decent Wi-Fi, USB charge points, blackout blinds and a balcony. The air con took a while to get going but once it did room was cool for the full week. Our view was OK, we looked across some of the grounds/gardens, kids club and perimeter road. As we had the baby they accommodated us by supplying a…"

 November 2022,5,An enjoyable stay at Allegro with Foud from Jumbo tours,"Allegro Agadir (all inclusive) was a brilliant stay and every penny was absolutely worth it. I ended up extending my stay because I loved how great my holiday was! The staff were lovely, had good banter and made me feel comfortable during my solo stay. The rooms were a good size, the variety of food and drinks was amazing. Additionally, if you would like to come to Agadir for an enjoyable & fun stay - Fouad from Jumbo tour group is your guy. He made our experience super lovely, he went above and beyond to make sure we had a good experience and were well looked after. My friends who stayed in Riu Tikida palace were also taken care of by Fouad from Jumbo tour group. We did a city tour with Said who was a fantastic photographer & well historically informed, a market shop where…"
 November 2022,4,Arnar & Jon Arnar,"We had a great stay at this Hotel for 8 nights. The Hotel was quite clean, the food was amazing...a there were a lot of funny and exiting acticvities by the pool every day. Also at the bar during evenings ! The staff at the Hotel was all through super friendly and welcoming...very nice, and always smiling - from people at the reception, the houskeeping ladies, gartners, guards at the gates, and waiters at the bars and resturants. We loved the private Hotelspace at the beach :) Special thanks and greetings to Naima, who cleaned our room so well, and was so nice - and Yassine, the amazingly nice waiter at the restaurant, who runned faster then the wind to serve people, always smiling and doing his best for everybody :) I still miss all the great desserts :)"
 November 2022,1,Definitely not 4 stars,Arrived on 8th November..an issue and confusion with the room allocation. Yes it was down to the agent but paperwork clearly stated that pool or sea view was asked for. First room got stuck in front of a wall I could nearly touch. Room was so tiny. We are here to celebrate our 30th Wedding anniversary which they knew family had rang to inform them.They did not acknowledge it at all. All we wanted from this break was to relax . Firstly there is no filter for noise you can even hear when next door or above flush the toilets. We have been here 3 days and are already to go home. The rooms have very basic facilities no tea coffee making facilities even with all inclusive if your not a morning or breakfast person you should be able to make a tea or coffee in the morning.

 November 2022,3,Honest review from regular family travellers,Honest review from regular travellers My review is based on a family of 3 with a 15month old child On arrival first impressions not a great deal to do with in walking distance of hotel very little shops but a few restaurants check in simple rooms a fair distance from the main reception Rooms clean and modern looking with decent bathrooms and comfortable beds no coffee facilities in the rooms kettles available on request hallways outside rooms look tired and in need of attention. Food is pretty poor we have travelled around the world and this food is tasteless with a poor selection for younger children the same bland pasta with a splash of tomato sauce every day / dry paella only plus with food was the varied selection of salads not good for western youngsters In my opinion…
 October 2022,5,Fawad and Ali,The hotel over all was amazing the staff were very helpful and language was never an issue at the hotel. The bedrooms were spacious and clean. The family were very happy. Specially the Moroccan tea at breakfast was amazing. Ali the operation manager was very helpful and always there willing to help. Fawad was another gem he helped us do our local tours at good prices and my nephew forgot his Wallet in Agadir Fawad made arrangements to get that back to us.
 October 2022,5,Experience at the hotel.,The staff were amazing and the hotel was always kept clean. The staff at the hotel such as the animation team were great and always strive to help everyone. Fouad our tour guide was great as well and never hesitated to help us at any time of the hour. He often made sure we were happy with any excursions we had done and tried his best to make sure we enjoyed this as much as possible. Definitely a hotel that I will come back to again. The manager Ali also made sure that anything we needed such as vegetarian meals that everything was adhered to and made the stay extra special always taking care of us.
 October 2022,5,GREAT EXPERIENCE.,I would like to thank all the staff of the hotel from the general manager to waiters and waiteresses also the chefs and the people working in the buffet area especially the girl who makes nice omlettes in the morning. We had a great time during our 5 days stay I also would like to thank the entertainment guys and the life guard without forgetting the reception guys who were so helpfull . If we decide to go back it would be definetly allegro hotel. We thank you for making our stay pleasurable and great. OUZBARA FAMILY.
 October 2022,2,Poor,"I can't even believe that I am writing a review after only 2 nights. I am still here for 3 days more. Problems since the very beginning, at the check-in, the security officer offered me to park outside the main door to drop my 3 suitcases. He also informed me that no parking was available in the main parking areas. So he asked to check in and then move car to another car park a bit further. This was not a problem at all until another driver ""hotel guest"" wanted to pass through to park where the security officer initially said there were no space available. When I asked him, he said there is a space reserved for him because he had stayed with them for about 10 days. Another that really strike me is the non/provision of water. Believe it or not, you have to wait till lunch time to…"
 October 2022,3,Average,"Positives: Lovely, friendly staff, who worked extremely hard to please everyone. Always with a smile on their face. The hotels in a great location and very close to the beach and the little shops. Negatives: The hotel was dated and is in need of TLC. The food was pretty average and quite often you would see people walk around with empty plates looking for food, which I found quite funny. The rooms were quite dirty. I am not sure how the cleaners clean the place as on two occasions we walked into the room just after the room had been cleaned but the floor was filthy as our feet went black within few minutes of being in the room. Shoes on the floor had not moved. The bedding was meant to be changed every day ( so was advised by the reception) but on day 4 our bedding had not…"
 October 2022,4,Mrs Noor,Quick check-in & the room was a good size & had TV & Also the bathroom had bath & shower facilities. The room was clean and had clean linen and towels in the room. The view from the window was overlooking the city and the entrance to the hotel. The bed was not comfortable
 October 2022,5,My second time at Allegro Hotel.,It's my second time to Allegro Hotel. Excellent service. Staff rep Fouad was very nice and a good organiser. Always on time for excursions. Would definitely return again for the third time. I will definitely come back in December.
 October 2022,5,Ask for Faoud!,"Before coming to Agadir, I had preplanned a lot of excursions to possibly do however once here, we were met by Faoud at the hotel who took over and instead booked everything for us. He sat us down and went through all the excursions that were available and booked our full week to ensure it was jam packed. We were picked up from our hotel promptly in air conditioned vehicles and driven to where we needed to go. Faoud even went above and beyond and took us for our evening meals when we didn't fancy the all inclusive at the hotel. He picked us back up promptly too and drove us to the marina for ice cream. Any time we needed to go anywhere, we dropped Faoud a quick message and he responded within seconds to let us know our vehicles would be with us shortly and they were. The…"
 October 2022,5,Excellent management and staff,"From the security man on arrival through to the concierge, reception, restaurant, bar and cleaning staff we were extremely happy with the service and friendliness. The animation team were superb and everybody made our stay perfect, we will definitely return."
 October 2022,5,truthful and honest review,"this is a truthful review so please read . Hotel- we were greeted by really friendly reception staff who were anxious to get us down to eat first before check in as we were delayed. We were taken down in person and shown the dining room and then told to return to reception after we had eaten to complete check in. After checked in a lovely man took our cases to our room ( bit of a walk). Hotel is lovely and clean but i feel needs a little TLC ie painting the corridors etc, but work was being done whilst we were there. Food- I am one of the fussiest people ever and i absolutely loved the food so much choice and the taste was amazing something for everyone to enjoy. Rooms- lovely and clean and spacious, next time i will book a sea view or pool view as the view was of a wall and…"
 October 2022,5,Allegro Agadir - October 2022 - fab holiday 🤩,"Fab holiday - Fouad, Abdullah and the team treated us like family - nothing was too much to ask! The hotel is great - clean, friendly staff, great facilities. Fouad went above and beyond, taking us out in his own car for additional visits even after the excursions we had booked were done. We had a lovely time and will definitely be back."
 October 2022,2,Not brilliant,"Couldn’t get into our room for 3.5 hours after we arrived. We were eventually shown to our room, which was already occupied by another couple and we were left sat on the stairs for 15 minutes whilst another room was found (not the garden room we had booked and paid for) but one over looking the side road. The key cards didn’t work and we were shut out of our room until eventually we were given a key. I asked three times for the safe to be opened and by the time it was the holiday was pretty much over. The food was fantastic and the dining staff worked very hard to look after all the staff however."
 October 2022,3,not great!,"Got locked in room day 1, the electrics on the door broke it took 2 hours for us to get out of the room, wasn't until after they fixed the door they asked to move us rooms. After being stuck inside for 2 hours!! NOT OKAY! The balcony door didnt lock, there were ants in the room, the hairdryer didnt work. Day4 i get locked outside the room, with the room being so far from reception i had to walk back and forth many times to get someone to fix the door AGAIN. when i told reception the door had broke again and i was not happy. ...his first response was 'we did ask you if you wanted to move rooms' yes you did after you had fixed the door. why would i waste more holiday moving room when you fixed it? it got fixed again. this was a very rude response from reception. i was very…"
 October 2022,5,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel. Staff and security are so friendly and welcoming. Very clean and well maintained. Food all fresh and very good. The only thing we would have liked is better choice for children in the restaurant. Pool and sunbeds were great! Definitely will come back next year!
 October 2022,5,Timo & Aziz !,"Really good location, amazing food, beautiful beach and the heart of the hotel - animation team - Timo and Aziz - very talented boys doing amazingly job. Without them it will be really boring at the hotel. Aqua aerobic one of the best we ever had, and their smiling faces all they long makes you feel better!"
 October 2022,5,Great place to visit,The service was outstanding the trip adviser was very helpful always on stand by helping us and providing safe trips organising even birthday surprise . Recommending to visit to his place Shirley coming back again .
 October 2022,4,"Lovely Staff, Lovely Complex. Use the Beach if Bravo Club isn't for you","It's a standard large hotel complex very near the beach in central location in Agadir. We were a couple after quiet and to a certain degree we got it. Hotel staff exceptionally friendly and helpful, good food. Yes, a lot of it is the same but you make your variety from the wide range of sameness. Hotel is scrupulously clean and tidy. Room staff very friendly. Safe is good - Wonderful bathroom & shower. Hotel is generally quiet room to room due to the thick concrete walls. The two main relaxation areas are the pool and their private beach area. Our advice (couple) - use the beach...secured...clean...quiet..comfortable & plenty of beds....near to WCs (2 dhms) and supermarket etc...Pool is very modern, clean, Good lifeguard cover, drinks and food bar - and they have Club Bravo -…"
 August 2022,5,VERY VERY GOOD HOTEL & AMAZING STAFF!,"We have been to Allegro for the last week of Aug 22 and was very pleased that we have made the choice to stay at Allegro given that we have had our 4 years old child with us.. Honestly, we were a bit worried when we were booking it, given that there were some negative reviews about the hotel and the restaurants/food as we were travelling with a young child. STAFF I am an avid traveller and have been in many lovely hotels, but I have never seen a hotel with more really amazing staff than Allegro.. They try their best to make your stay enjoyable... we would like to thank all the staff for making our stay in Allegro so wonderful.. In particular, 'Mohamed' the manager, who enabled us to stay in our room well beyond our checking out time, as we have young child with us.. Fuad - The…"
 October 2022,3,Pleasant hotel experience in fabulous location,"Staff are great, room and swimming facilities were pretty good. Food was just OK.....pretty much similar choices for all meals. Lots of people smoking around the pool area and gardens. When we visited it was pretty rowdy at times, and it's definitely a place for groups or younger couples. Some of the trips able to be booked through the hotel we're much more expensive than we found elsewhere, so look around before booking anything. Location is brilliant, two mins walk from the beach. Overall a pleasant holiday. Would definitely go back to Agadir, but we'd probably try a different hotel."
 October 2022,5,Perfect Anniversary Getaway,"Amazing stay at Allegro Agadir hotel. Honestly our plan was to stay the week in Barcelona, but we made a last minute change to a warmer vacation. I can’t say enough great things about Agadir. It all starts and ends with our helpful guide and new friend Fouad who was EXTREMELY accommodating to my wife and I (it was both our birthdays and our anniversary month). I wouldn’t have spent it any other way. 10/10 we would definitely come back for another vacation here. Fouad really took the time to make sure we were looked after the whole time. It didn’t just end with doing the excursions (with amazing and knowledgeable tour guides) but anything we needed from change (we weren’t entirely prepared for Moroccan money we were prepared for Barcelona) to food suggestions and everything in…"
 October 2022,4,Break away,"First time in Morocco lovely weather is always a bonus, close to everything we needed for the few days we were there. Mohammed on security and the rest of the guys on security super friendly always saying hello on passing."
 October 2022,5,A great family holiday!,"We paid very little for this holiday and I was very nervous about what to expect but it was fantastic! The food was healthy, delicious and safe- none of us got tummy bugs. The pool is plenty big enough and the staff worked so hard to keep the place clean and the people happy. It is quite loud and a little cheesy but with 2 young children that went down well. The only negative it we had to pay £80 worth of dirhams for the towels which was refunded on the last day and we were not able to spend it so we are stuck with it."
 October 2022,3,Morocco 2022,Hotel staff are friendly and helpful Rooms are of a good size (if you have mobility issues you should ask for a low level room) Rooms get cleaned everyday (if needed) Food is good basic Entertainment is ??

 October 2022,5,Relaxing Moroccan break with friends,"Fabulous break away with friends. Staff are so welcoming from reception to the evening. Fouad, Said, Aziz & Timo - so friendly and take their time to get to know you. Food was excellent. So much choice and brilliant selection of meats and salads. Big bottles of water always available at meal times too.Daytime entertainment was not pressured but available if you feel energetic! Aqua aerobics with Aziz was a lot of fun! Darts and archery too is a must! Let your guard down and enjoy. Varied evening entertainment suitable for all. Don’t bother bringing heels! Thank you to all the team"
 October 2022,5,Phenomenal,"Absolutely fabulous stay. All staff members were fantastic, Mohammed on security, Nour, Timo, Aziz- amazing. Hotel itself, exactly as it shows. Gorgeous room, very modern. Bed is huge and comfy. Breakfast, lunch and dinner I have no complaints. I have no complaints about the stay at all. Would recommend all inclusive more than anything because it was so worth the money. You’ll definitely meet great company around the pool, whether it’s the staff or people from your home. Entertainment was unreal ! Moroccan band, disco’s, karaoke. Suitable for all ages. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to come to Agadir. Hopefully we will be back next year."
 October 2022,5,Fabulous hotel,"Lovely hotel , entertaining staff were so so good. life guards and staff were brilliant. Food was lovely if I was their manager I would be very very proud of them all well done to you all and you all work so well . Great atmosphere"
 October 2022,5,Good experience in Allegro,"Fouad was an excellent help when planning excursions, and took us to a shisha bar, he was extremely professional and reliable. The hotel itself is clean, and there are many fun activities to join in with by the pool. The employees here are wonderful and welcoming."
 August 2022,1,"Hotel not the best . Food not that good . Staff were ok , but some had attitude. Wouldn’t visit again ever.","Food not that Good . No sunshine till 2.00pm Every day. Manager was very arrogant. Only 2 plastic cups per each person , small cups at that . Not a nice place to go really. Smell of drains all day every day. Hotel was not the cleanest, damp in Bathroom. Patio was over grown."
 October 2022,5,Wonderful stay,"This hotel is brilliant, the rooms are clean, modernly decorated and spacious. The bathroom and shower in particular are great. Fresh bedding and towels daily too. The food at the hotel is basic but varied, we found lunch to be lukewarm a couple of times but overall there was a lot of choice. The barbecue fish and morroccan night were particular highlights. The snack bar is also great if you just want a little bite too. The lobby bar is modern and also they serve popcorn and peanuts but this is not advertised but you do just have to ask. Also you can get large bottles of water here too as well as from the restaurant at lunch and dinner. We spent most of our time by the pool which was clean, a bit cold but refreshing once you were in. There are 3 pools and one is s paddle…"
 October 2022,5,Had a very comfortable stay with great experiences with excursions. Hotel staff very friendly,"Very nice, family-friendly and cosy hotel. Solid 4 star hotel and all excursions done through Fouad at jumbo tours who was very helpful and sorted out everything for us. We did activities each day and he promised a good experience each time, and offered to put any complaints with him should we have any and he would help."
 October 2022,5,Allegro Agadir,"Nice Holliday , you can get your excursions and escapes in the first day with the hotel Guid his name is Fouad everything you will need he will connect with the right people. The hotel is more than I expected, everyone is there to help and the food is different every day . Real nice experience all around, we will be back in next season. Thank you Allegro thank you Marocco!!"
 October 2022,5,Best experience in Allegro Morroco,Very beautiful experience. Worth coming. Will come back with pleasure. No fancy vibes just a lot of fun and open mind people. Recommended experience for all countries without sun. ❤️❤️Fouad rep Holliday recommended us a lot of good things and all the time present for any questions. 😍
 October 2022,5,"Relaxing, Organised and Safe",The hotel's interior and spacious lounge area is very nice. The pool area and the view likewise very pleasing to the eye. Mr Fouad sorted out our activities and made sure they were safe and enjoyable. I can say we were truly well looked after. 👍
 October 2022,5,Brilliant hotel,"Excellent hotel, very helpful guide Fouad who was very accommodating and had a brilliant time at Allegro hotel. He was recommended by a friend in London. 10/10 would come back for holiday. All the staff were courteous and friendly. Fouad went out of his way to make our trip a truly memorable experience."
 October 2022,5,"Great hotel in Agadir, would recommend!",Stayed 7 days all inclusive at Allegro Agadir. Lovely establishment with very friendly and courteous staff from the waiters to the housekeepers. Every was helpful and provided service with a smile. Our point of contact at the hotel was Fouad. He was recommended by a friend from London. Very helpful and hospitable guy who treated us like family and went out of his way to make our trip memorable. See you again Allegro!
 October 2022,5,Relaxing holiday,"We booked this holiday/hotel as a last minute decision, we arrived around 8.30pm check in was quick & easy, they let us have something to eat & drink before showing us to our room which was appreciated after a very long day travelling. our room was on the top floor right at the back of the hotel ( not ideal for us) and the view was of a wall covered in graffiti and part of the tennis court, which wasn’t great! but the room itself was great, beds are big, shower worked well, hair dryer was hit & miss if it worked, seemed like a loose wire! Housekeeping do a great job keeping rooms clean & tidy Food everything was labelled which is a bonus only downfall was the food is barely warm, and if the restaurant is busy you have to walk round to find a table, even then as we experienced…"
 September 2022,5,BEST HOTEL AND HOLDIAY EVER!,"I came here at the end of september with my boyfriend for out first ever holiday and it was just perfect! Everything from the transfer from airport to checking in and food ,the staff and the checking out! I cant say one bad thing about the hotel except the fact we was there for longer! Location was perfect! Such a quick walk to the beach where you have a private area and then to the marina! I love how modern and updated the rooms are! It was so not what i expected! the only thing in the room that was a bit annoying was the hair dryer as it didnt work! we did ask reception and they got someone to take a look but it still didnt work so i would deffo recommend taking your own if you can! The beds are so comfy and there is defiantly more then enough space! We didnt have the best…"
 October 2022,5,Fantastic value hotel,"Please don't be put off by your first impressions. The hotel foyet is a bit dated and in need of a lick of paint. Apart from this however the hotel in brilliant. Lovely friendly receptionists, bar staff and restaurant staff. The Animation team work tirelesly to provide everyone with something to do daily and evening (managed to get the hotel dance by the last day!) The hotel rooms are very modern and spotlesly clean, as is the whole hotel. The food albeit a buffet, is really fresh with plenty of choice to cater for every type of person. My girlfriend is vegetarian and there were plenty of options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We booked 2 trips through Fouad the hotel rep, the Hammam and massage, and the fishing boat trip and both were exceptional and great value for money…"
 September 2022,5,Excellent stay and will recommend,"Good hotel, 1 minute walk to the beach, attentive staff, clean and safe. Good choice of trips too via Jumbo group. Multiple pools for the kids and adults to use. Staff are amazing, Mohammed Amound, Aziz, Sukrina etc were all amazing. Plenty of options for drinks (alcoholic and non alcholic), good sunbathing beds."
 September 2022,4,2 week holiday,"Had a great time at Allegro. The entertainment team always try to get you involved with the activities. I honestly dont know where they get there energy from. Special hello to Nejeet the entertainment rep, prettiest woman in Morrocco"
 September 2022,4,Great entertainment team,Arrived with bad weather but when the sun came out facilities were good. Room good with the most superb bed we've ever had (superior room) even if the bed did fill the space still room to move around. Entertainment team (timo in particular) could not do enough to make the stay enjoyable. Food was plentiful even if not all of it to our liking. All incusive drinks were just what we needed to relax. Location perfect for beach. All other staff pleasant but at times rather busy with lots to do.
 September 2022,5,"Best experience, Highly recommend","This was my second visit, this time with family. I had an all inclusive package, food was excellent and quite a varied selection for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Staff were very helpful and accommodating. Fouad was exceptional, he helped organise many activities for the family. My mum and aunty were very pleased when Fouad took them for free to the Souks, a guide was waiting for them and took them to the best shops, he also paid for a few items as they hadn’t exchanged all their money yet. Please do come to Allegro and ask for Fouad and say you’re a friend of Adam haha, he will make sure you have the best time in Agadir. You can contact him on the following number on WhatsApp: +212 610-404141"
 October 2022,5,Second time in Allegro Agadir,"Very good experience, I would recommend everyone to go and visit this place. People are very friendly and always willing to help. Fouad rep Holliday is a very good and genuine person, always willing to help. See you next time In Sha Allah."
 September 2022,4,Nice play to stay in Agadir,Clean rooms and freshly renovated. Hotel staff were very welcoming. 2 mins walk from the beach….hotel has a private area for guests with security guard to keep local vendors at distance. Food catered to all but did have to pay extra for premium alcohol brands. Tour guide Fouad based at the hotel is very friendly and helpful. We booked several excursions and prices were similar to online. Hotel brings local vendors including Henna lady who was very good at designs and reasonably priced. We really enjoyed the holiday and would consider booking again if in Agadir.
 October 2022,1,"Standard Hotel, not a class of stars","Recently stayed here, so called 4 star hotel. Room service was very poor, no drinking water, tea or coffee. No slippers and gowns. No toothpaste or toothbrush provided by hotel. Sliding WC door, bit embarrassing 😳 For the swimming pool you pay 200 Dirhams deposit for each towel for pool. Food: Average. EXCURSION: Avoid at all costs. Hotel provides a tour guide/ sales agent Fuad . Firstly he will scared you not to use others’ services so you only can rely upon him. Went to Marrakech which was £65pp. They took us in a old market place where there were blacksmith, leathers market etc, lots of potholes, no walkways for pedestrian. People riding bikes and donkeys cart droves over your feet. Met two students outside the Bhahia Palace museum, who asked us if it was worth it…"
 September 2022,5,Amazing Experience,"Stayed at allegro for 7 nights and had an absolutely amazing time there, I highly recommend staying at this hotel. Hotel and rooms are very clean and the pools are cleaned every night and every morning very thoroughly. The food was amazing and there was something for everyone from international to local dishes. We felt extremely safe in the hotel and outside the hotel as there was security everywhere, at every entrance and even at the hotels private section of the beach. The staff In this hotel go out of their way to Make your experience amazing. From the entertainment team who were amazing and always made you feel included, to the amazing tour rep Fouad who we booked all of our excursions through (only recommend booking through him) he is a very honest and good man. We wanted…"
 September 2022,5,Amazing!!!!!!,"Just got back from a week at Allegro Agadir! Staff are amazing location is perfect and would definitely go back in the future! Shout out to Yassine the photographer! He made such an effort to speak to us everyday! Definitely made us feel like we could go to him about anything, not just for photos. Although we did buy photos and they are stunning! Thank you Allegro!"
 September 2022,4,September Chill,"Myself and my wife stayed for 7 days in September, apart from a couple of overcast, rainy days the weather was 26-28C. The booking in process is quite chaotic, and you have to fill in forms upon arrival, a £23 visitor tax is also paid. Our room was excellent, bed huge and comfy, and courtyard garden well maintained and peaceful. Food is abundant and tasty, we were on half-board basis, so wine was extra, served in a covert way and tips expected as the staff bring you an extra carafe on them. Pool area is tad tired, and would expect this will be refurbished in the near future, could do with a better cleaning regime, better chemical cleanse of the pools. Staff work extremely hard and are very courteous to all guests. City tour is great value and our driver Said very…"
 September 2022,5,Honest review,"Been here for 3 days in Allegro Hotel. It’s such a crazy experience especially with the entertainment team ( Timo, Aziz, Nour, Ayoub and Nina ). The entertainment during the day and the night is great and enjoyable. We loved it. The music also is great and crazy. Big up entertainment team. You’re the best.!"
 September 2022,4,Lovely week,"Honestly, I didn’t know what to expect when I was reading the reviews before we flew out. However I was pleasantly surprised! On arrival the check in team were quick and got us sorted as quickly as possible to ensure we got an evening meal on arrival. After a day of travelling usual you’d expect to have missed the evening meal and in other places I’ve had to venture out for tea when checked in so this was a brilliant service for me! Food - We were all inclusive. Yes the food is repetitive… but there is plenty of choice. If you decide to pick the same thing everyday that’s your own doing!! There’s fresh salad for all meals, a variety of breads. Breakfast consists of boiled or scrambled eggs, fruits, cereal, salami, cheese, omelettes made to order, Lunch at tea there’s…"
 September 2022,5,Good experience in Agadir,"Agadir Allegro Hotel is it one best hotel to stay , spent 1 week with good service , nice buffet food and good service from hotel's manager MOHAMED HARKOUCH and staff ,very helpful! And i suggest to contact Fouad for holiday and activities."
 September 2022,5,Great stay,"Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel and could not find anything to back up some of the bad reviews on here. Medium sized hotel in a great location close to the beach on one side and some shops, restaurants and exchange bureau on the other side. The staff really are great, very helpful,friendly and good fun The food was excellent with plenty of choice to suit all tastes. You will not go hungry or thirsty here! We had a superior room on the first floor overlooking the pool. A good size and modern in design, the air conditioning was excellent and the room contained a safe, small fridge,tv with some English channels,usb charge points, a good sized balcony, a hairdryer in the bathroom along with a good strong shower and plenty of hot water. The only slight niggle we…"
 September 2022,5,Allegro,"Had a lovely stay. The hotel was well situated, right next to the beach and all the shops/restaurants. They had great night time entertainment. Staff, security and cleaners were very friendly. Special Thanks to waiter Amoune Mohamed he made sure we had everything in our table, always was very friendly and always could cheer us up"
 September 2022,5,Lovely hotel,"Great friendly hotel, lovely rooms had nice ground floor with terrace with view of pool. Nothing to much trouble for the staff,gardeners worked hard every day to keep place looking fresh and presentable.Food was excellent with good choice and changed daily,maids cleaned room every day with fresh towels also. Booked city tour through hotel which was very good and well worth £24,went to the port,kasbah,local argan oil shop,large local mosque and very large souk with 5000 stalls.loved the surprise package for my partner which hotel had set up for our arrival chocolates,cake fruit and a bottle of champagne and some lovely towel sculptures on the bed, overall could not fault our stay here will be sorry to leave on Thursday night."
 September 2022,5,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel, amazing location. I want to give a massive applaud to all the staff, bar staff, reception staff and massive applaud to all the entertainers everyone was so friendly and welcoming. The rep at the hotel i believe his name was faroud he was very very helpful and very friendly anything you need you see him. There is also a little shop in the hotel grounds and the man ibrahim i believe is a very friendly man and very reasonable prices. Will definitely be visiting this hotel again next year! A must go hotel if you ever go to agadir"
 September 2022,5,"Perfects for friends, couples or solo. Highly recommend","Staff, food, cleanliness, weather, location all 5* The gardens are well tended. Plenty sunbeds. Five mins from private beach. Camels on the beach, hawkers too but not allowed to enter private area. Large food choice, wait staff friendly. All around great time. Will book again"
 September 2022,5,Allegro very good experience,We had a very good experience at allegro the room was lovely and very clean like the rest of the hotel. All the staff are very friendly especially the tour guide Fouad he made sure we had everything we needed for all our trips. I would definitely visit again and recommend it to others!
 September 2022,2,Bring ear plugs,"Location and staff are good but there is no gym and every night music played by the pool is so loud you can’t sleep before 1am. I had to buy ear plugs and even with it, I could sleep. People are waking up to book the transat at the pool by leaving their towels from 9am which is really annoying."
 September 2022,5,Great hotel to stay at when visiting Morocco,"Just got back from an amazing 7 night stay as part of a group of 13 . The hotel is very clean and you are made to feel safe with security a priority. The room was big enough for 3 and the bed was super comfy. You have a free safe and fridge to use and the a/c worked great and was needed . The food was very fresh with a good selection of both local and international dishes . We went all inclusive and enjoyed the drinks available , there was the option to pay for premium drinks but never felt the need to . There are plenty of sun loungers and there are 3 pools to enjoy with activities you can get involved with if you wish , the pool area was regularly cleaned throughout the day and cleaned thoroughly at night . The staff were extremely friendly and enthusiastic , we were made to…"
 September 2022,5,A week at the Allegro Hotel,Just returned from a week at the Allegro . Had a really enjoyable time . I can’t fault either the Restaurant or Bar staff who all worked tirelessly to make are and everyone else’s time there both relaxing and enjoyable. The Hotel was very clean and the Restaurant covers all dietary needs I.E vegetarian. No problem with sun-beds as there were plenty so no early morning rush. There was a good mixture of English and French and very drinkable Beer and Spirits. The beach is just across the road which is impressive to see . Unfortunately we were unable to see the Atlas Mountains owing to there being a drought meaning there were no waterfalls . We would like to have tipped the restaurant staff but found no place to leave it . Overall fantastic time and we will return next September…
 September 2022,5,Can’t wait to come back next year!,Stayed at allegro for 9nights amazing time staff was so friendly and couldn’t do enough. If you love heights I would recommend you doing the cable cars they go right to the top of the mountains I have never seen such a beautiful view it was lovely if it wasn’t for fouhad (tour guide) we would not of managed to go also we did quad bikes which was brilliant booked with fouhad (tour guide) this lovely man goes up and beyond to help u have the best experience in agadir his English is perfect also Mohammed the manager is so lovely he will go out of his way to assist you Can’t wait to come back next year!!
 September 2022,5,Mr K James,"The hotel was very pleasant, clean . The staff were very helpful and f Our experience was made even better by tourist Guid Fouad his advice was very good ,helped to make my time in Agdir even better will come back."
 September 2022,4,"Good hotel, improvements would make it great.","My wife and I came to the Allegro Agadir for a week to celebrate our wedding anniversary in September. We had read the reviews and had great expectations for our holiday. The previous reviews pretty much cover most of the good points of the hotel and staff, but we didn’t put on the rose tinted spectacles as we entered the hotel like 99% of the previous reviewers must have done. The hotel itself is very nice, well maintained and cleaned non-stop. The check in is fairly quick, although we arrived after 10pm so it was quiet in the reception area, when checking in during the day it looked a little hectic and unorganised. The grounds and gardens are lush and well tended with lots of grassed areas and some amazing flowers. The rooms are modern and very clean, the staff that…"
 September 2022,5,Allegro Agadir,"The hotel was very pleasant, clean and staff were very friendly and fun. Our experience was very nice and wouldn’t have been the same if Mr Fouad wasn’t here to help us organise our trips from the hotel to each excursion, he was a great help with advising us on places to visit organising all trips drop off and pick ups just excellent we shall see you next time. Hotel is amazing location next to beach and amazing steak house."
 September 2022,5,Amazing holiday review!!,"Came to allegro with my girlfriend & 9month old daughter. we are both in our early 20s. after reading the mix of reviews we can safely say that you can trust all the good, ignore all the bad !! we have had a great time. it’s very chill, the food is great and have a good variety. the staff are more then helpful, the entertainment staff are so good at there job and put 100% into everything. there are activity’s throughout the day. the beach is 2mins from the hotel including a private part for the hotel.

 September 2022,5,"Great holiday, 100% recommend","We visited last week for 10 nights and had the best time. Hotel facilities are great and clean. The rooms were modern, towels changed daily and rooms always cleaned and spotless. The staff always made the most effort and made our holiday one to remember, super friendly and always wanting to help. Some evenings the entertainment staff would join us for lunch/dinner and would go out their way to talk to you around the pool. Fouad helped us to arrange some great trips and a meal out on our last night. Make sure to book through him to get the best price and everything organised. The manager Mohammed was always helpful and around if you needed anything. Food was always a good choice and something different each day for lunch and dinner. Breakfast they cooked fresh pancakes and…"
 September 2022,4,Lovely hotel,"I visited here last week with a friend. The hotel is kept beautifully clean, grounds and rooms. Towel change daily. The food was plentiful with good variation. I'm not a fussy eater but sure everyone could find something. The beach is a short walk over the road, again the area cordoned off for Allegro users was kept immaculate. The sea can be rough so take care. Drinks are strong, again take care 😉 If, like me you like a cup of coffee/tea before leaving your room and take a kettle, take a mug too as you are not allowed to take the China to your room, and if fussy on toilet roll, take your own. Big shout out to Ash and the entertainment team, they work really hard to keep guests happy I'll be back one day!"
 August 2022,5,Great stay at allegro,Strongly recommend this hotel it was an amazing experience and Foad made the trip worthwhile. Offered very good services and always room care of everything. He is very good man and stays true to his word. He made the stay worthwhile.
 September 2022,5,Great stay at Allegro Agadir,"Excellent experience at Allegro, extremely friendly staff, nice place. Fouad looked after us extremely well, very honest and kept to his principles.

 September 2022,3,"Great hotel, location & good staff","We stayed at Allegro from 06th September to 12th September in a deluxe family room. Room We stayed in a family room as 3 adults (family). Initially, the room was clean and appeared good value for money. However, after the first night you realise quite how noisy it becomes from 9.00pm until early hours. The entertainment is on until 11 but did exceed this most nights. People coming back to rooms up until 3am very noisy, I had to make a make-shift bed in the walk-in wardrobe & pillows to ensure I could sleep, the noise was atrocious. The bed and sofa bed were very hard and uncomfortable. The room wasn’t as clean as we thought, the beds aren’t pulled out, very dusty behind. The fridge didn’t work well, took ages for water to get cool. The aircon worked well. The safe also worked…"
 September 2022,5,Agadir Allegro,Our first time visiting Morocco in general and we were very pleased with the service we received . Hotel is in a great location as it’s close to the beach. Almost everyone has good English and all the staff especially at the bars and restaurant are friendly and like to joke around. ( Red One best barman) Also Ash is really good DJ and organizer of evening attractions. The room was comfortable and a large bed. We also had a balcony with 2 seats and a table with a good view of the pool.
 September 2022,5,Great hotel and amazing staff,"Our first time visiting Agadir and Morocco in general and we were very pleased with the service we received . First of all, The hotel is in a great location as it’s close to the beach, nightclubs/bars and other restaurants and shops. The day we arrived we were welcomed by a friendly receptionist and we were soon shown our room (which was in a perfect location on the second floor with pool view). Almost everyone has good English and all the staff especially at the bars and restaurant are super friendly and like to joke around. They also make very good drinks:D Also the security guard at the beach is the sweetest man ever. His name is Yassine, We visited him almost every night as he’s doing night shifts at the beach and he often welcomed us with some fresh fruits. He is a…"

 September 2022,5,Allegro amazing hotel,"Would definitely recommend to come to allegro hotel, staff are really helpful and all activities can be booked at a great price when you have a welcome meeting. Mohamed harkouch is the hotel supervisor, he is very helpful with everything we needed within the stay, recommend highly, see you next time!"
 September 2022,5,Good stay,"Lovely clean hotel, lovely staff, especially Fouad and Mohamed barkouch for the trips and management. Food is a good variety, and caters for everyone. We had no issues at all and would definitely come back. Don’t let comments about stomach problems put you off, you will get that anywhere because of the ice, just avoid the ice and you’ll be fine! Animation staff are brilliant and the entertainment is great round the pool during the day and the evening entertainment too!"
 September 2022,4,Great Allegro Agadir,"Our time at the hotel has been lovely, members of staff have been amazing, especially at the lobby bar. Fouad - the tour guide - arranged some amazing trips for us and was very helpful. Shame the weather in the last few days hasn’t been great but all in all been a fantastic holiday."
 September 2022,5,Allegro Agadir,"We had a lovely week stay here in early September. All the staff were really kind and helpful. The food was amazing every day, lots of choice and traditional Moroccan food. Special thanks to Fouad for organising our excursions and giving us all the key information for our trip here in Agadir. Would definitely recommend Allegro hotel :)"
 September 2022,5,Fantasia dinner,"An amazing evening lots of entertainment,great food,trip was well worth the price,faoud was a really great help,don’t book outside of your hotel,always go with your hotel rep,as there are lots of touts outside waiting to take your money"
 September 2022,4,"Relaxing, clean, tidy, happy staff","Here now enjoying a relaxing holiday, we paid a little extra for the room and it was well worth it ! Food is fine a little repetitive but that tends to be what you get when AI for this price. The staff have all been extremely polite, whilst not pestering you to join in. Manager is seen daily (not seen anyone complaining to him) just walks round being seen and mucking in where needed. We have been out for some Meals that have all been delicious, see my other reviews and I have been running on the front in the mornings there is a police and army presence but this didn’t concern me at all. All in all a lovely holiday."
 August 2022,4,Family Holiday - UK,"We had a amazing family holiday couldn't fault the hotel and staff very friendly. First time to Morocco and would happily go again, food was repetitive however there was something for someone at all times plus ,entertainment was good and enjoyable during the day time. Security was excellent felt safe at all times."
 September 2022,1,Are we at the same hotel?,"We are currently on day 9 of our 10 day stay, I would have come home on day 2, had I been able to make contact with our holiday provider. First room was overlooking a public walkway, that in itself not a problem, however the SS Runes graffiti plastered along it was, I didn’t want to look at that whilst drinking my morning coffee! Had a word with the manager, Muhammed, who did move us after pointing out, you get what you pay for! Really! The “Rep”who invited us to a welcome meeting, wasn’t actually a rep provided by our holiday, he just wanted to sell his trips, very convincing though with a welcome letter. On arrival the pool was cloudy with black bits on the bottom. This however changed the following day, after a visit from environmental health, a change to the pool filter,…"
 September 2022,5,Amazing hospitality!,"This was the first holiday i have booked and was quite nervous. Me and my family unanimously agree this was by far the best hospitality we have recieved anywhere! They have such attentive and kind staff that are always on the go to help. During our stay a staff member named fuad helped us with whatever we needed eg if we needed to travel somewhere he organised and booked all our excursions! We could go to him with any issues and he would sort us out! I highly recommend him to book anything, he is a very kind person and will go above and beyond to help. The hotel itself was beautiful from the room to the views and restaurants along the beach side which is across the road. Would definitely go there again if i was to book a trip."
 September 2022,5,7 night break,Just back from seven days in this resort absolutely loved it one of the best places to stay. If you want a proper foreign holiday where everybody is local this is the place to go. It’s not obvious from the other reviews I read that this actually has a private section on the beach with their own sunbeds which are free to use and a security guard. At no stage on this holiday and we walked everywhere every day did I feel not safe. You will be inundated regularly by Street sellers just get used to it and politely say no thank you and I will leave you alone. We ate out every evening and tried all of the local restaurants its fantastic value for money.
 September 2022,5,Hotel was AMAZING!,"The best holiday I have been to! Amazing staff, so friendly. Lovely rooms with beautiful scenery. The rooms even have smart TVs. So many things to do which we booked with our incredible tour guide Fouad. Don’t book online excursions, they are much better with the rep holiday as we had problems with get your guide. Fouad fixed this for us and was so helpful. Couldn’t recommend this enough!"
 September 2022,5,Good recommendation,The room service is as good as it comes as well how the rooms are kept. Style is very modern and easy to get along with staff. Rep holiday make it easy to plan all of your activities while staying safe at all times. It was very enjoyable. See you soon in sha Allah.
 September 2022,4,Great place with very nice staff!,"Everyone is very helpful and very nice! Especially the tour guide Fouad is understanding and great! Highly recommend this place. The beach is not far, the pool is suitable for all ages. The rooms are okay and are suitable for a family."
 September 2022,5,Great Holiday at Allegro Agadir,"Lovely hotel, perfect size all the staff are so lovely and friendly. Our tour guide Fouad was wonderful, was always friendly and saying hello. Gave us advice and information on everything we needed to know! Couldn’t have asked for a more lovely rep! Thank you for making our holiday so wonderful."
 August 2022,5,Brilliant Holiday at Allegro,"We have just arrived back from our first holiday in Morocco, staying for 10 days at the Allegro Hotel in Agadir. First impressions were not great. Hotel looked a bit tired, long drawn out check in process, chaos in reception and a rather unhelpful manager who didnt seem to be able to smile. Despite the poor start, we had one of the best budget holidays ever. Rooms were clean and bright. The food was of good quality, plentiful, varied and hot, but without a doubt, the best part were the staff. From the bar staff, restaurant staff to the entertainment staff, all were, despite getting paid very little, and in the case of the entertainment staff, nothing at all, were always friendly, smiling, diligent and unbelievably hard working. We just want to give a special thanks to Timo,…"
 September 2022,4,Lovely family holiday,"Just got back from a lovely family holiday. Nice food, clean, always sun beds available, lots of activities available everyday, great animation team - particularly Driss who made a real effort to include us all. Family friendly beach with lots of space for playing in the sand and shallow water quite a way out for lots of space to paddle etc."
 August 2022,1,Disappointed,"The staff were not very friendly or helpful. We did not feel welcome. The GM of the hotel barely cracked a genuine smile at us. I always initiated the greetings. The service staff were obscenely flirtatious with select guests. The men would totally ignore me, or look busy the other way, to avoid me asking them for anything. On the other hand, they were way too friendly and helpful to my wife and other women. The ""mini-club"" for kids is a great concept, and has the potential to be a successful service. Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience with them. The monitor of the mini-cub, Nina, didn't make an effort to bond with our 4-yr old son. She kept her distance from him, never really felt comfortable leaving him with her. One day we ran into her at the hotel's restaurant,…"
 September 2022,5,Allegro is great!,"I enjoyed a 10 night stay in allegro with my girlfriend and it was beautiful. The hotel was perfect from the staff, the food and the location. The staff were very helpful, especially fouad and Mohmaed harkouch when planning a trip out of the hotel. The hotel was very safe and offered 24 hour security. I would 100% recommend allegro as a hotel when staying in agadir😊"
 September 2022,5,Excellent stay,"We had excellent 7days all inclusive stay. The manager as well as the whole staff was accomodative and friendly. First night we had a room that was next to evening entertainment area but we were able to change it as travelling with a young child. We were pleased with food, plenty of vegetarian option as well as meat and fresh pizza. The hotel is not ""moroccan "" style but if you are looking for modern and clean hotel, this is the place to go!!!"
 September 2022,5,Lovely friendly hotel Allegro,"Excellent service. Friendly staff. Catered for lots of vegetarian food. Faud our friendly agent so helpful, arranged and explained all the excursions. Supported in all taxi service. Thank you great all inclusive service. Great for all, lots to keep you entertained in the hotel service. Highly recommended. 👍👏👍"

 August 2022,5,Mr Abdul Jolil,"I and my family had a wonderful time at our stay in allegro hotel. It was my daughter's 21st birthday, found our tour guide, not only did he arrange all our daily activities, he also arranged my daughter's 21st birthday surprise with the whole room decorated and a birthday cake, we wasn't charged a single penny! This place I can't express how good this place is, from the early morning room service to dining hall, lobby and reception the staff are 10/10 especially Anuwar and his bar crew, Mr Abdul Karim, mohammed to the security man standing outside with a beautiful smile. I can recommend everyone to come and experience yourself and see how good this place is. Thank you to everyone who took care of us during this visit. Will come back again!"

 August 2022,5,100%,Really I loved this hotel it was a very nice experience I really recommend this hotel to people who want to visit Agadir because it is very quiet the staff are very nice and friendly especially the manger Mohammed was very helpful. Thank you allegro team
 August 2022,4,Great visit,"Great visit to Agadir, hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Tour guide Fouad was great in arranging for excursions which were very fun - our favourite was the jetski. Hotel room could have been better located as was quite far from reception area but was close to cafeteria and pool. Cleaning staff were friendly but struggled to understand English and didn’t always clean the room how we wanted it. Manager Mohammed was very friendly and helpful."
 August 2022,1,Staff steal and the managers cover for them!!!!,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! Untrustworthy cleaning staff who steal belongings with the hotel taking no responsibility and saying it’s a police issue. The incident occurred on the second day of our holiday and the entire trip was ruined trying to prove to management that the cleaner stole AirPods. We have the tracking app and they clearly saw the AirPods were in a location only staff can enter. The time they were stolen mirrors when we left the hotel room. It’s a disgrace the whole system as we have to wait around just to be told they can’t do anything or reimburse our money. I STRONGLY urge no one to book this hotel and to let others know. The management and staff ruined our whole holiday, we had 3 rooms and we weren’t even offered any compensation. The cleaner was allowed to carry…"
 August 2022,3,The only review you need from a honest person staying 2 weeks!,"This hotel can host hundreds of people so if your interested in booking and staying in Allegro Agadir please listen up I will rate everything out of /5. 𝗣𝗼𝗼𝗹-2/5- Starting this off with a poor start, the pool advertised in the reception above the exchange rate table is another hotel being shown don't get me wrong the pool features a U shape main pool and a circle right next to it and then a small baby pool. There is an issue with this though. The pool is good enough for a paddle its not big enough, and its freezing and Agadir isn't exactly boiling like Marrakesh. The hotel has many issues but the lifeguards don't even have uniform the hotel doesn't provide them so they wear there own uniform. 𝗙𝗼𝗼𝗱/𝗗𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗸-3/5 If your coming to Allegro for a feast don't get your…"
 August 2022,5,Words of gratitude.,"A big thank you to all the Allegro Agadir team (management, staff of all departments) for making my stay with my family one of the most enjoyable holidays. I also would like to thank Mr mohamed for making our time so easy and delightful. He was there for everyone who needed help or assistance all day long with his cheerful face and smile. I will be very happy to come back again with my family to stay at your hotel and enjoy the services of your whole team. Your sincerely Zahira Rouchadi Kamal."
 August 2022,3,Itsok,The restaurant and bar staff work tirelessly they are the heart and soul of this hotel...cleaning staff..not so good!.. Food is very good..

 August 2022,5,Amazing family holiday at Allegro in Agadir,"We stayed at the Allegro for 7 days,a family holiday with 2 teenagers. The hotel was lovely,clean,rooms cleaned every day,beautiful gardens maintained by gardeners. There were security guards around the hotel grounds & in the hotel,we felt safe. The guards were friendly and pleasant. The food was vast,plenty of choice,the staff were lovely . The location of the hotel is excellent with the beach just a few mins walk over the road,the beach also had a private area just for guests staying at the hotel,this was looked after by one of the hotels security guard,lots of sun loungers available and very peaceful. Muhammed the manager was always visible & always said hello. The animation team were fantastic in keeping everyone entertained and engaged with activities, Raf & Mehdi and all…"
 August 2022,1,VERY BASIC HOTEL,"I have booked this hotel knowing that Barcelo has taken over I'm really disappointed as I was expecting more. Let's start by the good things : The waiters ,the pool guys and the entertainment team were all excellent so is the food with a plenty of variety along with the traditional Moroccan tagine. Now the disappointing things : 1) Ignorant and incompetent management and reception staff. 2) Cheap flat drinks and when you want the proper drinks they ask you to pay although it's all paid on all inclusive basis 3) Very small pool, all sunbeds jammed next to each other not even tables by the sunbeds. 4) the hotel cannot even afford to give uniform to the lifeguards as they were all wearing Casuals and you will not know who is the lifeguard or not unless you can spot the…"
 August 2022,5,Family trip to Morocco hotel Allegro Agadir,Our heartfelt thanks to the management team at the hotel who made sure that our trip was enjoyable and smooth. Food was lovely with a lot of variety. Rooms cleaned every day with new towels and sanitary products. Our particular thanks to Fouad who is the person anyone should go to to book excursions and activities. On the first night we arrived late but Fouad made sure we had our dinner before checking in (we were very hungry by then). Fouad also explained the activities available in Agadir and also went through the exchange rates. Mohammed another person also very active and always trouble shooting any queries we had. Anwar another individual made sure the children had access to water on the first night (literally midnight). Kids loved everything in particular the swimming pool…
 August 2022,5,Our recent stay....,"The hotel itself is very good. The rooms are spacious and clean and the public areas are well looked after. Generally the food is nice, with plenty of choice. We did four excursions while we were here, Fouad the tour rep was fantastic in arranging everything, really would recommend. Thank you so much"
 August 2022,4,Summer holiday,"We stayed here recently… hotel was good.. Fouad the hotel rep, was excellent. The excursions we selected through him were brilliant. Worth the money. Fouad was at tentative to our needs, he made sure we were well looked after. He was always to hand for any help. Mohammed the hotel supervisor was also good. Always to hand to help. Definitely recommend. If you stay here, make sure to liaise with Fouad!"
 August 2022,5,Review,"Great hotel! The animation team went above and beyond to include us in activities during the day and in the evening, always making sure we have everything we need! Loads of activities during the day with a variety of music for everyone! Big thanks to Timo who was amazing during our stay making it an even better experience! Also special thanks to Said, who helped us out on our first day when we arrived late with food and our rooms. Definitely recommend this hotel and would revisit!"
 August 2022,5,Review,The animation team and Timo are brilliant. They keep everyone entertained and are very energetic . The music they play daily is of mixed variety. The food is delicious Even my 14 year old daughter ate lambs foot.

 August 2022,5,Allegro Agadir,"We just spent 10 nights in the Allegro Agadir and it has been one of our best holidays. Fouad the holiday rep is an absolute gem. We booked our trips and he was a mine of information could not have been more helpful helped to make our holiday hassle free, thank you for all your help. The entertainment team are probably the best we have come across in over 40 yrs of holidays ( Raf and Timo tremendous). If you prefer English food stay in England . Some of the Moroccan food is among the best you will get. There is plenty of variety and always a varied choice. The rooms have recently been renovated , were cleaned meticulously everyday and your towels changed daily too. Thanks to all the staff for contributing to our wonderful holiday."
 August 2022,5,Review,"I would like to thank the animation team for my making my holidays amazing and enjoyable. Speracial thanks to Timo, Mehdi, Sousou and Nour. You’re the best guys.! You are always Trying to bring the sunshine. Gracias amigos.!"
 August 2022,3,Allegro Agadir….mostly a good experience,"We stayed at the Allegro Agadir for 10 nights. Generally it was a good stay - lots of good points, but a few negatives to be aware of (hence 3/5 rating). See sections below: Hotel general areas: This is rated as a 4 star hotel. I’ll be honest in saying it definitely is not - probably more like a modest 3 star on European standards. The general areas are a bit tired and could do with some modernisation. However the staff work hard to keep things clean, and hygiene standards are good. Pool area: We were staying mid August and the hotel was at max capacity. This meant the pool was packed. Unfortunately there is a daily sun bed / towel issue which requires you to place towels early in the morning if you wanted to be assured of a bed. The hotel do place laminate cards on the…"
 August 2022,5,Lovely hotel with the best animation team and welcoming feel!,"Just spent a week here with 2 adults and an 8 year old, had the best time! The animation team couldn’t be friendlier always asking for everyone to join in with family friendly activities for kids and adults together which was so nice. Special shout-out to Raf and Soufiane on the animation team who kept taking our little one to activities which he loved and kept him entertained in the mini disco, will be coming back in a few months just to see them! Definitely keep an eye out for Raf if you go as he makes a special effort with the kids and whole family together. Only recommendation is that they don’t have soya milk and food isn’t labelled with ingredients (if you have any allergies). Highly recommend this hotel!"
 August 2022,5,Amazing hotel with great service and Excursion advisor Fouad,"Overall our stay at Allegro was very pleasant and enjoyable so I would highly recommend to anyone. Pros Tour guide Fouad was very helpful and I would highly recommend booking all your activities through him. He saved us alot of haggling and very knowledgeable about the local area. Fouad has great relationships with most of the local businesses so he was able to book us activities and excursions at very reasonable prices without us having to book travel and other extras separately. Upon checking-in, Fouad will provide you a leaflet with all the activities/excursions they provide and book a consultation time for him to explain it all. Most of the excursions and activities have a fixed price per person and show how long the duration of each activity is. This made it a…"
 August 2022,4,Lovely Hotel,"We really enjoyed our visit at Allegro Agadir, what a beautiful place with lovely staff members, our room was also cleaned everyday… there are only a few faults that i would like to mention the wifi in our room was quite poor but in our friends’ room it was fab and also we seemed to miss a lot of clothes once our rooms had been cleaned. but over all what a great experience and we would truly 100% do it again! the meals were great and we loved the swimming also, we highly recommend! Also our rep fouad was a great host that helped us organise all our trips out and helped us feel very very welcome! he also organised a lovely table for us to celebrate my birthday which was so very nice of him. there was also another staff member that made us feel very welcome also and his name is…"
 August 2022,4,Brilliant family holiday in Agadir,"We are a family of 4 and have spent a fantastic 10 nights at Allegro Agadir. Lovely and clean hotel, close to the beach, and lovely separate section of beach cordoned off for u. Food very same'ish and struggled some days as I have a restricted diet,even after speaking with the chef. Staff are fantastic, very friendly and always on hand to help. A big thanku to Fouad who is always around, his meetings are a must on your first day here. We booked all our trips with him and were not disappointed.We did the City tour, the 4x4 day trip and exploring, the camel ride to flamingo reserve, and the day trip to Marrakech. Also went up to the kasbah in the cable car. All were absolutely brilliant , especially with having 2 teenagers to keep occupied. Weather was very hit and miss. 3 full…"
 August 2022,4,Review,"I've been staying here for over a week and this was probably the best time I've spent in a while. The members of the animation crew are amazing, wonderful and exceptionally nice and energetic, especially Timo,Muss, Mehdi, sousou,Nour and Soufian. As a teenager, they made me feel so safe, secure and included. The activities were also top notch. Thank you guys for making my holidays enjoyable."
 August 2022,5,Review,"Great animation team, big thanks to Timo, Mehdi, Mouss, sousou and Nour. They are always trying so hard to put smile on our faces and to push us to join their activities such as aqua volleyball, aqua gym, waterpolo…etc. To be honest, they are always trying so hard to spread good vibes. If i want to come next year, i will do it just for this great animation team. Thanks everyone. Much love.🥰"
 August 2022,5,My stay in Allegro.,"Best hotel i've ever been to. Good food, nice service, clean rooms, ( getting cleaned everyday) Had a great time with my family in this hotel. There is a Kid's club for the kids so that parents can go out. Recommended 100%."

 August 2022,2,Mixed feelings,"The catalog pictures and reviews makes you expect something more but the hotel is really average. Pros: - very friendly staff - quite good food with proper variety, especially breakfasts are really not bad - huge supply of snacks at the pool bar (fries, nuggets and pizza are decent quality and it’s always there fresh) Cons: - outside areas of the hotel are really outdated and looks old and dirty, rooms are renovated and they all look the same, doesn’t matter which one you choose - all the rooms has the same air conditioning which works only for 1 hour around 5 o’clock at night, the rest of the day it only makes noise but no cooling at all, and it’s not the problem of any particular room because I did change it during my stay and it was the same in every room- it’s the…"
 August 2022,5,Fouad - Jumbo tour group,"Fouad, was an amazing tour rep, he ensured that all our bookings for excursions were booked on a timely basis and all went smoothly with very pleasant taxi drivers. He was always available to answer any of our questions about Agadir. Thanks Fouad."
 August 2022,5,Loved our stay in Allegro!,"My friends and I recently stayed in Allegro and we can't recommend this place enough! The rooms were spotless and comfortable, the pool area and beach area were great, the food was delicious with plenty of choice and the staff were so friendly and attentive. We'd especially like to thank Ali and Simone for being so Amazing at the lobby bar each night. We booked a few excursions with Fouad, who was so friendly and organised. He went above and beyond to make sure we were getting the most out of our trips. Thanks so much to everyone at Allegro for a great trip - We would definitely return 😊"

 August 2022,5,Thank you Fouad (tour rep),"Had a Fantastic break at the Alegro, made particularly special by our Jumbo tour rep Fouad. He explained all the trips at our welcome meeting as you would expect but also gave us advice about how the seasonal weather affected specific trips. ( Can highly recommend the camel sunset ride by the way). Fouad was really accommodating and easily changed one of our trips at short notice when our daughter got Ill. He made a point of coming over to see us to check our holiday was going well and provided a WhatsApp contact number in case we needed him when he wasn’t around. Really went over and above. I also witnessed his professionalism when a guest wanted to book a trip for the following day that was fully booked and the guest was really nasty to him expecting him to magic places up…"
 August 2022,1,Horrible stay,"Arrived at 9.30pm on the 9th august. would not let us check in as they were rushing us for food as the food area was going to close. The staff were not friendly at all. Only people that were was simohammed at the bar, cleaning lady and the security guards outside. Other than that everyone was awful and misreble. The didn't like people that spoke English only French. The food was awful 😖 my grandson got a tummy bug and so did I. One of our rooms smelt like dirty gutter smell went to reception he was not helpful and said we cannot move u rooms to come back in morning we did that and they still did not move us. Spoke to manager he was hopeless too. Sent someone up to spray the room which didn't make any difference at all. The pool area wasn't very clean. Rooms were OK. Never…"
 August 2022,1,Never again,Not what we expected at all seems like a lot of people's comments have been deleted who have had stomach bugs due to eating at this hotel my son being 1 of them.food is mediocre not the best. The guy who deals with the excursions at the hotel horrible unfriendly person as we refused to book our excursions with him so for the 10 days we were there he never spoke 2 us or greeted us very bad customer service .the bar staff are lovely and the animation team are brilliant.the pool area could do with some maintenance overall would not be coming back to this hotel again.

There was an amazing welcoming atmosphere in the hotel with the entertainment team going over and above to make your stay special. The evening activities were varied and over a ten night stay we didn’t see a repeat of any evening activities. The entertainment team always made a special effort to make sure they spoke to you each day and always asked how you were. So thank you Mouss, Sousou, Timo, Nour, Souf, Medhi and Raf for making it the holiday.

I will start by saying though the staff here do work very hard, the bar staff, the bravo team, cleaners, kitchen staff never ever stop! However after two days here myself and my family fell extremely poorly! Obviously first reaction was I had eaten something that didn’t agree with me! But after 7 days of being very unwell I ended up with antibiotics from the chemist and it cleared up the bacterial infection that was making me extremely poorly! Was not just my family! Everyone I spoke to had the exact same problem! When I spoke to management they said I must have picked it up…"

 August 2022,2,Never again,Nice hotel good room some areas are looking tired and run down like the swimming pools. staff are nice and polite lack of entertainment on the evening though .both my partner and I have been suffering from a tummy bug and have had to go to the chemist and buy drugs to combat it .we have only eaten the food at the hotel we are also aware of many other guests who are also ill or have been ill I'm reluctant to try anymore food and certainly won't be returning though we still have a few more days left to endure
 August 2022,5,Agadir,"Fabulous holiday, entertainment team fantastic especially Mouss, Raf, Sousou, Mehdi and Timo.

They take you dirty towels in the morning and put them back after they clean your room. Could be in 2 hours but could be in 9 hours like yesterday. Really? Not everyone is at the beach from 7am till 6 pm and shower first thing in the morning. Smoking is allowed everywhere. Beach area, pool area, scack bar at the tables. Horrible. On the first night we didn't even have a remote control in our room looked like our room wasn't properly prepared and stinks of mould which is all over the ceiling in the bathroom. Air con also blows…"
 August 2022,5,Maia's family experience,Super cool. GREAT ANIMATION TEAM!! we loved you it and we will come back for sure. The family rooms are ok for 3 adults. Restaurant should have more healthy food. A lot of fried things even on breakfast. Not much options in terms of fruit and people should pay a fee for wasted food!!
 August 2022,5,Our experience at Allegro Agadir Hotel.,"Since my arrival at Alegro agadir on the 5th of August.

The food was excellent and plentiful different from day to day. The bar service was excellent. The restaurant staff were friendly,cheerful. I had a very good stay and I did enjoy every moment. I would like and welcoming every time I I would like to thank Mr mohamed for his support ,help and assistance. He was present every time I or any of the customers needed any help or information. I will not hesitate to come back next year as my self and lot of other people from the UK share the same feeling like me.once again I thank the whole team for all their efforts and hard work.…"
 August 2022,5,Sad to leave,"Thanks to all the staff without exception. From the reception, whom I thank for his help and availability on a daily basis, the entertainment team, the serious and kind ladies of the households, the gentleman who provides security at the entrance, the vigilant lifeguard, the waitresses, waiters , cooks. without forgetting the beating heart of the hôtel Mr Mohamed . The hotel is clean, very clean swimming pools, perfect deckchair. There is no lack of comfort, we eat good grilled or cooked fresh fish every day! ...How not to return to this hotel where the staff (many) do everything possible to satisfy the customers See you soon"

 August 2022,3,"Allegro Hotel, AGADIR","I am here right not and I have to say this is a Very average hotel and I was underwhelmed on arrival unfortunately, certainly not a 4 star but a low 3 star hotel. Rooms are ok, pool could do with a face lift as looking a bit tired out! Doesn’t seem to be enough bins which is odd. Staff are friendly enough. Food is again average and often cold when served which worries me. What do children want on holiday? Easy answer Ice Cream, why are you NOT having ice cream at meal times that children like! Vanilla, Chocolate or Strawberry would do nicely, not Lemon sorbet and pistachio ice cream, come on its supposed to be a family resort! Also could do with a snack shop on site for the snacks you do not provide like Ice Cream, Crisps and sweets. It a lot need to be put in place to make…"

 August 2022,2,Sunbed mayhem & preferential treatment!,We are halfway through our holiday and are not happy! My granddaughter loves the pool so I get up early to get a front row sunbed so she can swim with her armbands and I can see her. The pool was being cleaned until late this morning so we took her to the beach for an hour. When we got back pool was STILL being cleaned but our towels had been moved to the back row and someone else was in our place. Note on bed saying we had been away too long. All well and good if no OTHER beds available but there obviously were! When we arrived and no beds available NOONE would remove towels of empty sunbeds for us. Seems like ‘local’ visitors take priority over British ones - beware!!!!! Other than that it’s ok here.

The food was very nice and there was always something to choose from the all inclusive buffet. The pool was amazing and having the beach close by a bonus , I actually couldn’t fault the hotel . All that said by far the best thing that the Allegro has going for it is the staff , I’ve never come across a bunch of people that are so motivated in making your stay enjoyable, the entertainment staff are some of the nicest people you could meet , Raf and SouSou went out of their way to spend time with us and deserve a huge pat on the back for making our holiday extra special ❤️ , Ash the…"

Our stay was lovely, the staff all welcoming and friendly. The food was outstanding which catered for everybody's taste (we were spoilt for choice) The house keeping was daily which I couldn't fault. This hotel was very comfortable and I would definitely cone and stay here again. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were met by our holiday rep (Fouad) he was a lovely guy. He explained everything, answered all our questions and we booked all our excursions through him which I am glad I did as I felt safe and assured. Overall this has been a great holiday experience and we have all loved our time here. Thank you to all the staff who have gone above and beyond with everything but a special thanks…"
 August 2022,1,This hotel plays music constantly in all areas!,"Nice looking hotel, good food, clean, nice staff, lovely gardens, good pool. BUT why do they play music very loudly all the time. We were desperate to get out of there- because of the constant very loud music. They play music from 10am to 1130pm. NOT the place for a relaxing holiday."
 August 2022,4,"Extraordinary staff , and exceptional service from arrival to leaving.","A very very good 4 star hotel although there where things that could be done to make life a little better. Kettles aren't standard you have to ask for them. The proper coffee isn't available until 10am . The pool closes too soon at 1900 . I can't eat a stew (tagine) every day especially when it's hot on average expect at least 3 on show. Staff are over streched there needs to be something dome with the way that drinks are served such as tea and non alcoholic drinks are handed out. Advise is taken on board when I gave it but I'll reiterate here also. Only fish , merguase sausages and burgers where served . Could do kebabs varied meat on there also little more often. Family Rooms could be looked at to have 2 bedrooms separate as the bathrooms are huge in comparison. And the…"
 August 2022,5,Holiday,"Amazing holiday in a truely superb hotel. Everything was perfect. Our travel rep from Jumbo Tours, Fouad was excellent. Very knowledgable and helpful. If you are thinking about coming to beautiful Agadir, I highly recommed this resort and Jumbo Tours."
 August 2022,3,A mixture of good and bad!,"We visited Allegro Agadir as a family of 4 (2 kids ages 10 & 11) at the start of the summer holidays. Upon arrival, we were placed in a room with a non- existent balcony area which was far from ideal considering the layout of the room meant we all shared the same space (the idea was to sit on the balcony whilst the kids were in bed). When we went back to reception to rectify the problem, the manager was less than helpful stating “we class this as a garden view balcony” and if we didn’t like the room “we could book into another hotel” because they were full and nothing could be done about it. I will give him his due- he was nothing but polite and helpful from the next day when he did actually move us rooms to a room with a balcony and was extremely friendly (maybe it had been a…"
 August 2022,4,Great hotel,"We returned 5 days ago. The hotel was lovely and clean, staff friendly and couldn’t do enough to help you, nothing was too much trouble and they always had a smile for you. Unfortunately the weather wasn’t brilliant but this did mean we did a few trip booked through the tour rep at the hotel. He was great and always there morning and night for the trips. A particular favourite for my 9 year old was surfing, we also did the crocodile park, city tour and the Moroccan night. All enjoyable and the transport good. Was also lucky to have balloons, flowers, cake and the room dressed for my birthday which was a lovely surprise. All in all a great place to visit."
 July 2022,5,Great 10 day family break - Hotel and trips!!,"I don't normally review but I must say what a fantastic holiday! Hotel staff are lovely, friendly and made our stay really enjoyable! It was my first trip to Morocco and all I can say is that the Moroccan people know how to make you feel welcome! Lovely pool, drinks and food was fantastic! great location for long walks along the beach front almost every evening with so much to see and do! some lovely trips we had, camel rides, mini Sahara and city break were all fantastic. Highly recommend this hotel...."
 August 2022,5,"Great family holiday, hotel and trips.",Superb Family holiday. Hotel was nice and close to the beach. We did 6 trips in our 10 days and they were all great. The mini Sahara was the best. We enjoyed the relaxing pool and the animation team were great. It was great to see the Morrocan culture and the area is not overly touristy. Found tour guide work in jumbo tours group All our trips were through them.

We booked a double room and had a single put in for my child and there was still plenty of room only downside to the room is there was a few occasions the door was left open after being cleaned and as we rarely was in the room during the day the door could of been left open for hours also half way threw the week the spare…"
 July 2022,5,You won't regret it ❤️ The best team,"⚠️ Long review⚠️ 5⭐️ I don't normally do reviews as I always leave holiday generally very satisfied that I've not been at home, had some sun, no housework, no cooking and a pool as a bonus, and then I have holiday blues, so this is rare for me as I get busy being back at home again. I wouldn't believe any negative reviews from this hotel. If you haven't communicated your concerns while you're there then that's on you in my opinion (without being rude), because these guys go above and beyond & no good comes from moaning once you've got home. 1. We are a well travelled family and this is the friendliest place we've ever been too and so cultured within the hotel that you don't have to go far if you don't want to for the Moroccan experience (we enjoyed the complex all 7 days…"

Big congratulations to Ash for having the best team next to him ( Mouss , Souka , Timo , Raf , Nina and Mehdi ) for making our holidays amazing. We miss everyone! They chose us for being part of the Moroccan Wedding Show (best experience ever) so we got ""married"" again but in moroccan style. We have got moroccan names wich everyone was calling us Aisha and Jinery (I don't know if I spell it well). Many thanks to Yassine for being the best and the most…"
 February 2022,4,Good hotel in central location,"Stayed for two nights whilst in Agadir on business. This large hotel is well located towards the centre of, and slightly back from, the beach. Secure parking on site was available. From the outside the hotel has a very 1970’s concrete look, but on the inside the hotel has been renovated to a good standard. Check in was a little slow but the staff were friendly. The room was a reasonable size with a good comfortable bed and shower, WIFI worked. The room had a balcony overlooking the pool area. I felt the breakfast options were a little limited, but this may have been because the hotel was still quiet after flights to Morocco has just resumed. A solid hotel in a good location."
 July 2022,5,"Crazy, Amazing Holiday 😲.
I loved it 😍","We stayed at Allegro Agadir for 10 nights. All hotel staff are very friendly, happy, interactive and helpful in the same time. All pools are very clean, the restaurant has a very high standard and the food was very tasty and good, with lots of diversity food. The bar's have great people too, fast on their job and very happy at the same time. They even have a professional photographer. We did a lot of pictures with Yassine. Lots of memories But, from all this amazing place ,the most unbelievably amazing, was the entertainment team. We felt like we become a family . They are the most craziest, full of energy, friendly and caring people I've ever made. (We keep in touch with them too) They even invented some Moroccan names for us! I really miss them.( Muss , Souk , Raf , Ash…"
 August 2022,5,Memories for life ☀️🇲🇦❤️,We had the most amazing time here with our family. The service was 10/10 and the staff very friendly. They went out of their way to make the stay comfortable and relaxed accommodating all our needs and requests. The hotel was clean and lots of activities for the kids. There was lots of choices of food to suit all tastes. Our hotel tour rep Fouad made our stay even more special by organising amazing trips and birthday celebrations in our hotel rooms. We will definitely be back in 2023 inshaAllah xxx
 May 2022,5,Great Holiday,could not have asked for a better Holiday...room was standard but very clean and cozy....the food is unbelievable for an all inclusive holiday...The staff are very friendly and happy to help with anything..would like to say that Suk (bravo club) Raf (bravo club) & Ali (Lobby bar) all made sure we enjoyed our holiday to the fullest..I never met Mohammed the manager but I saw him daily making sure everything was running to high standards. Even picking rubbish up himself instead of calling a cleaner. we had one issue that was the hair dryer in the room didnt work and was fixed within 1 hour. All I can say is what a fantastic 2 weeks I had And would happily return..would like a better view next time but am not gonna moan about that..thanks Allegro and all the team
 August 2022,5,Ash and the entertainment staff,Hi ash and the rest of the entertainment team it's Jason Bourne. You know who I am ash . The staff at hotel where fantastic and kept us laughing and made us extremely comfortable. A credit to the hotel . See you soon ash and team . Jason Bourne
 July 2022,4,Great for the price,Alot of the problem had nothing to do with the hotel more about the surrounding area and smells. The hotel was perfect and I think I would have happily paid a little more for the stay if needed but overall a good stay. Just bring your own alcohol

 August 2022,4,Lovely holiday,"We just got back from a lovely week in Allegro Agadir. The hotel staff are fantastic and are always friendly and helpful. The hotel has lots to do during the day such as volley ball, tennis, Aqua aerobics etc. The rooms are lovely however I think it is worth maybe paying more for the views as we over looked a graffiti’d public walkway haha and didn’t get much sun on our balcony. However, we wasn’t too bothered as we spent barely any time in the room except for getting ready. The hotel does not provide late checkout for guests who fly home late however after a conversation with the manager, Mohammed, he managed to sort us a few extra hours in the room. So make sure you speak to him if you need anything, he is super helpful and really goes out of his way to help guests. …"

The rear of the hotel leads directly on to the beach where the Allegro have there own allocated area. Fouad our rep at the Allegro made it so easy for us. Helped us settle in, checked up on us throughout the stay & organised all of our excursions with minimum fuss & delivered on everything he promised.

On the day of arrival, we had to wait till 8pm for towels & a child bed, as a family we needed to shower so we could visit buffet as we had a really hungry & tired from travelling young daughter. No bed for our child, repeated visits to reception to be told different information, my Husband on the 5th time insisted towels & a bed were bought to us. We finally received these essentials. Superior pool view room was not big enough to put a fold up bed in , we asked the house keeping to push the very large bed across to put in the children’s bed, which was not really…"

Next we were met by Fouhad who honestly went to great efforts to ensure we enjoyed our holiday safely. He advised where he wouldn't recommend, how to deal with people outside of the hotel safely and we partook in a lot of the excursions (city tour, camels, quads/buggies, mini sahara jet skis and boat ride).

We had a garden view room which was so convenient for the children as they were able to be outside 24/7. It was also near the poolside which was another convenience. Special shout out to Foaud our tour guide who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. He booked all our excursions and on top was always there to book taxis for any places we needed to go. He also gave us recommendations for places we could go to eat which we really appreciated.

 July 2022,3,Allegro hotel,"Got back one week ago , have to say the staff were very friendly, Tito and Ash part of the bravo club were always happy chatty and polite , as were the rest of the team , just can’t remember their names , the bar staff were incredible so busy and only being 2 of them kept it all smooth , the restaurant staff were also very polite helpful and friendly, wouldn’t say it was a 4 star , the food was ok the rooms could of been cleaned daily rather than on the 3rd day and the towels were not replaced so had to go chasing towels atleast 4 times which is not good because we had to go to reception each time which is a good distance from our room , the management did get it sorted each time , but it did keep happening!!!"
 July 2022,5,Great Family Holiday!,"It was our first time visiting Agadir and Allegro Agadir was a great place to stay at.

The hotel was clean, modern and the scenery outside by the pool is beautiful. It’s also in a convenient location as the beach is 5 mins away and there are lots of places to eat and explore around. Breakfast was great too as there were lots of variety to choose from. I really enjoyed my stay here and would be looking to come again."

Our first experience at breakfast left a lot to be desired,undercooked omelette(shell included)people handling food with no gloves on,quite a few people not using tongs provided,people barging past,very little hand sanitisor available. The choice of food was pretty standard for all inclusive,very repetative,lot of recycled dishes. Lunch and evening meals pretty much of a muchness,same old same old.

 July 2022,5,Fouad Tour Guide (Jumbo Tours),Fouad is the man you need to meet he is helpful from day 1 arranges everything even arranges transfers to and from the nicest restaurants. He know Agadir well and has packages to cater for families and couples and singletons The Hotel is not as good as him.. He is always visible daily and communicates well
 July 2022,5,Fantastic holiday,"We had such a superb time here. The food was lovely, apart from one night, just all tagjnes, no other choice, apart from that there was a great choice. We went all inclusive. The beds were super comfy like premier inn beds. Rooms were airy with aircon. The entertainment team and music around the pool was awesome. Mousse and Tito were fab, organising aquafit, yoga, water polo, volleyball, salsa dancing every day. They were the fun factor and made our day. The snack for the kids was chicken nuggets, chips or pizza, and good pool bar. The beach is wonderful, and the hotel own a section on the beach with beds, which was a lovely touch. The beach is 5mins walk across the road. This is part of the Barcelo group, which I wasn't aware of.. Cleaning was going on all day. A camel…"
 July 2022,4,Overall good stay,"We have just returned from 2 weeks at allegro. We had two rooms booked the superior family room and a superior double or twin, both rooms where spotless, the family room had plenty of room, could do with more storage though for 4 people. Plenty of fresh towels. Soaps, body wash and shampoo, it could have done with another bin as there was only a really small one in the bathroom. Rooms where cleaned with clean towels everyday (on two occasions our room was not cleaned but Mohammad the manager ensured that someone brought us fresh towels and toilet paper straight away the first thing and then the female manager (I forget her name) made sure we got them straight away the second time, there had been miscommunication the second time which was quickly resolved. Both managers where…"
 June 2022,5,Great relaxing summer holiday,"Went on 2 week relaxing break with my boyfriend and his family. Rooms were nice and up to date, cleaned every day. Food was okay just not well seasoned but always something to choose from. Pool area was always full but the hotel has private beach and there was hardly anybody there. Also, On the first day with booked trips and activities with Fouad (Tour guide) who was very helpful. We would definitely recommend this hotel and we will be coming back"
 July 2022,4,Fab holiday,"One of the best holidays we have been on, for several reasons. FOOD - my partner is super fussy and worried about the food before we got there. But every single night the food was fresh and lovely. It was different every day which was great. You get given a 1.5L of water EVERY meal, it was such a nice gesture. Breakfast has fresh omelettes/fried eggs to order, fruit, yoghurts, pancakes etc. Lunch in the restaurant was always different with a bbq Snack bar had pizza, chips, nuggets and fruit every day (this didn’t change but it weren’t a problem) Dinner was amazing, with so many different options. Different meat every night and different potatoes, pasta etc. ROOM - very clean room and we got fresh towels every day and the beds were made. There’s a safe to use in the room free…"
 July 2022,5,Great comfortable hotel,"Friendly staff and good safe and comfortable hotel. Management were on the lookout all the time making sure everything was ok. Great food every day. There was tennis, basketball, football and table tennis available for guests. The hotel was guarded from every side therefore very safe."
 July 2022,5,Best week in the hotel,The hotel is great the workers are amazing its fun for the whole family. The food is excellent and there is endless entertainment and all the thanks to mohamed the manager the rooms are so clean .....
 July 2022,5,Everything we wanted and more,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel for a week all inclusive visiting from scotland. The food was great, fantastic fresh selection that caters for all. The food was also different each night which was great to see. Fresh coffee, drinks including cocktails were excellent. The room itself was just as great was clean with air con, great shower, large comfy bed and balcony. The sheets and towels were changed daily. However rooms shouldn't really be advertised as sea view. The hotel is a very short walk from the beach. We also didn't have use of the safe in the room as it was locked on arrival (we did not mention this to reception). The pool was very lovely, standard battle for sunbeds with people reserving with towels but we found the hotel's private beach was often free for use…"
 July 2022,5,Best hotel,"This is the best hotel that we have ever stayed in. We meet the tour guide on arrival & helped us settle in. We had a meeting the next morning at 10 the tour guide FOUAD which he went through everything with us about the hotel, trips & the local area. He was very helpful. The staff are so friendly & would go over & above for you. The pool is very big & our two boys loved it. The entertainment during the the day & evening were very good. Nina was very good with the boys in the mini club. The room was great. Would highly recommend this hotel."
 July 2022,4,Family holiday,Went to Allegro Agadir end of June. The reviews I read about the staff are spot on. They’re very helpful and efficient. The rooms are a decent size and clean only thing I would recommend is have two single beds instead of a sofa bed as the older kids don’t want to share and the hotel could do more to accommodate that. The staff work hard to maintain the cleanliness of the hotel. It’s a comfortable environment to be around we have no complaints about the hotel and staff at all. The food however could improve. We went all inclusive and everyday the breakfast was the same and we felt everything tasted the same at lunch and dinner. Besides Pizza and chips there was nothing for the kids to eat we had to take them out to eat as they were starving. The snack bar only has Pizza…
 July 2022,5,Great family hotel,"Very friendly staff, rooms are great and spacious with a smart TV. Foad was very helpful and gave us great deals for excursions. Taxis were all included which was great! Private beach was very nice and close by."
 May 2022,5,Unbelievable Stay,"Without Mr Mohamed Harkouch (the Hotel Manager), my review would be different! Such an unbelievable energy, happiness and kindness. He might be the biggest reason why people stay longer / go back to Allegro hotel!"
 July 2022,5,Mariela and Angel,"The hotel was nice, the food very from different type, therefore we can try the different cusinese. As a regarding for the staff, there where very friendly and always try to help as much they can. A very special thanks we would like to said to Ash and his team from Bravo club for their professional entertainment all the time. We really enjoyed our time there and we would like to go back again. Thank you Allegro Agadir 👍😊🎉"
 July 2022,5,The best holyday ever,"Great hotel, great location, great staff, great food. For the price we paid, we felt great. Beach and center near the hotel. A large selection of food, everyone will choose. The staff is smiling and helpful. Special thanks to Fouad Ioub, who always willingly helped us with trips and experiences. He will recommend surfing in a great place and other experiences. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back. There was another gay named Mohamed helpping people next to swimmimg pools. He was such a nice person!!! We have never been treated so nicely. Thanks so much Jana & Marian"
 July 2022,3,Not as advertised,"We returned from Allegro last night after having a lovely break. Staff are fantastic, very helpful and friendly. Manager is on the ball always checking everything and on hand. Food was OK. Bit too many Tangines and spicy food. Room was large and comfy but needed bedside cabinets and more draw space. The only let down was the facilities. The hotel advertises the following, Tan Tan nightclub, Panoramic bar , Spa, tanning studio/solarium, coffee shop, golf course, jacuzzi, pedalos and gym. None of these were available ! As I said, lovely hotel fantastic staff but non existent facilities"
 May 2022,4,Adorable Agadir,"First time to this hotel , rooms lovely , hotel spotlessly clean and food really good . Not much evening entertainment when we were there but still really enjoyed our stay . The reps are very friendly and not pushy , and first time ever on holiday where the trips are cheaper to book through hotel rather than outside . The most impressive thing about this hotel is the manager , he’s always walking around over seeing everyone and everything. He’s extremely good at his job from making sure all hotel guests are happy, we then seen him plumping up the cushions . His attention to detail is Wow !!"
 July 2022,5,Excellent hotel with great food in great location near the beach,"I was choosing between 8 hotels in Agadir and decided to go with Allegro as it seemed to have the best reviews for what we were looking for, and we were very pleased to have chosen this hotel. The hotel is in a great location 3 minute walk from the beach. We booked a room with a sea view and had a beautiful view from our balcony overlooking the whole hotel area with lovely green scenery, the pool, and indeed the sea in a distance. The hotel room was clean and modern, the bathroom was great too. We booked an all-inclusive rate and as we hired a car and planned a busy program during our 4-day stay, we thought we wouldn't use it much and end up eating out, but in fact we didn't even eat out once, the timing of the breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel was so convenient that we…"
 May 2022,3,"Allegro, Agadir","Children’s entertainment was shoddy and lacking. We found the child care workers to slack especially when they were booked for childcare we were told by them they are closed and it took us going through different members of management literally back and forth for only to discover they were open! They also need to facilitate for family entertainment at night not just a half hour slot for children’s disco which lacked any structure and organisation which in return hardly had any children. Tour operator Fohad, on the other hand, was superb with his hospitality and professionalism. He dealt with our complaints about the children’s workers satisfactorily."
 June 2022,5,Fantastic hotel,"I have a good time with allegro hotel, I enjoy in my trip and I liked activities in the hotel in swimming pools, also the room was nice, and l like the food in hotel was very delicious. Allegro team are very friendly and helpfully specially the manger of hotel MR. Mohammed, I think back soon to allegro hotel."
 August 2021,5,Unforgettable!,Allegro was such a great time. The lovely people (the staff) right there were always working to make us feel comfortable. I want to thank especially Mr Mohamed Harkouch for all the efforts. A team player definitely!
 July 2022,5,Good hotel,The hotel is comfortable and has more activity’s also the food in hotel is Deliciou. the staff are friendl. finally I would say thanks to manger of the hotel MR. Mohammed and all allegro team I has nice experience. I’ll back to the hotel.
 June 2022,2,Not good,We had to ask for a change of room 2 times. First time because of the noise and the second time because the room hasn't been cleaned. The cleaning of the rooms in general is very poor. They tried to give the rooms a modern look but the qualities are too bad. The building is very old. Good internet. The buffet is not bad but I missed vegan options and to have typical maroquin cuisine. The snack bar doesn't have much.
 July 2022,5,Wonderful holiday,I spend a wonderful holiday in allegro agadir. All the staff are kind I appreciate the rooms the service the food everything was perfect. I will surely come for next holidays. I would give a special to the manager Mohamed harkouch for his services

 May 2022,5,best place I ever been,Staff are super friendly. Always helpful and with smile answering all questions. That was My 3rd time in the hotel. After the renovation 1st and I really love it. Mohamed always super helpful and always there for every guest. Food very well. Really recommend this place for stay. I will be back for sure :)
 June 2022,4,"Great place, bad food.","Fouad was our holiday rep during our holiday in Allegro, Agadir. Fouad was amazing and really took the time to make sure we were looked after, he went above above and beyond for my son when he wasnt feeling well. Fouad organised our excursions, and were not disappointed with his recommendations. I really recommend Fouad as he warm, friendly and put us at ease. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel itself is lovely, rooms are spotless, cleaned every day and fresh towels. Wifi is good, and location is excellent beside the beach. The staff were very friendly, and are eager to help. Unfortunately, the food really lets this place down. Breakfast was the only meal that we enjoyed in the hotel. Every other meal was inedible. Everything tastes like Argan oil. Its really not good. …"
 June 2022,2,"Good room and location, hostile service mainly","Pros -Room is newly refurbished, comfy bed, towels every day, hairdryer, good tv, like usb charge points. Location excellent. Faoud, the excursion rep, took us to carrefour so I could buy a bottle of wine for the week and my boyfriend the same as we don’t go to bars or do poolside night activities, wanting quiet evenings after long excursions. Mixed reviews on the tours, some awesome, some not so good but treating as separate as don’t know how much that’s the hotel or not. Cons - on Tuesday one of our room keys stopped working. The same day a skirt went missing, very distinctive and had been laid over my case. Told reception and someone did come up to read the lock and we did get the key fixed. It’s a small item, it had small sentimental but not financial value, so we just asked…"
 June 2022,1,Do yourself a favour and book a different hotel especially if your not from Morocco.,"First of all I’d like to point out I’m British and I’ve worked in the hotel industry in the uk for years. 1. The housekeeping steal from your room and when you report it they just say, you tourists always saying something is missing check again, don’t even take the problem seriously, I also question what it is they clean when they enter as the floor/bathroom does not get cleaned they went inside our fridge and also move our belongings around everyday… 2. The food was not only just bad it was disgusting! Flys on the food and gave us both diarrhoea! we had to eat out all week and I heard the same comments from other guests when we spoke so its not just my opinion. 3. They charge everything including water x3 what the cost is anywhere outside of the hotel. 4. The pool closes at…"
 July 2022,5,Review,The staff here are extremely friendly. From the moment we arrived they made us feel very welcome. I would definitely recommend anyone coming to Agadir to stay at Allegro. If I ever decide to come back I know where I'm staying.
 July 2022,5,Wonderful stay!,"Everything at allegro agadir was fantastic, from the start we felt comfortable and well tended to. The manager Mohammed provided exceptional service along with the rest of the staff. Would definitely stay here again!"
 July 2022,5,Best sleep in Agadir,"Best place to go in Agadir if you want to stay in for a welcoming experience Exceptional service, very friendly and always hand on deck for you when you need anything Big up Muhammad the big boss who looked after us"
 June 2022,4,Lovely hotel,Hotel is lovely and clean staff friendly. WiFi best we ever had connecting all over the hotel. Plenty of sun beds. Beds are high and comfy I am 5ft 3 and had to climb to get in the air conditioning was great. The food was cold it was mostly fish pasa and pizza or meat on the bone.Lovely big ring doughnuts from the snack bar around 4pm. The only thing I say a Downside is the steps to our room there was 50 odd from pool to room. 36 from start of block to our room. And it look like a prison just needed the nets!!! Would stay again...... They have there own beach roped off but no bar there just sunbeds
 June 2022,5,Amazing,"This was my first time in Africa and it was unbelievable. The staff and service at the Allegro Hotel went above and beyond for us when asked and always up for a friendly chat. Never stayed at an all inclusive but the food and drink was always excellent. The manager Mohammed was very kind and helpful with any queries we had. The trip wouldn’t have been the same without our rep Fouad, who organised our trips to the souk and other activities With safe transport every time."
 June 2022,5,Amazing holiday in Morocco,"What an incredible week in Allegro Hotel - All inclusive. The rooms are beautiful, the hotel has lovely decor and most of all the staff are just so wonderful. They are so friendly and kind. The manager Mohamed Harkouch was very kind. We were looked after by Fouad, the hotel rep who kindly booked us great excursions and took care of us so much, ordering taxis to the beautiful Souk, and nearby areas. The all inclusive food and drinks was great and thoroughly enjoyed trying all the different foods. The reception were very helpful for any thing we needed! I highly recommend Allegro Hotel and would even return. They have a private walk way to the beach and section, offering towels and entertainment! Beautiful place with beautiful people. Thank you Fouad and all at Allergo!"
 April 2022,5,outstanding,"We are from Galway, Ireland, We got special offer from Ryanair in April 2022, We booked hotel for all inclusive, We loved the hotel for the following: 1. Lovely clean , spacious room 2, Lovely breakfast, lunch , dinner, I loved the fish , lamb, beef, and the selection of vegetables , salad , fruit 3. Staff was very friendly, especially the manager, he was always on hand to help you 4. walk on prom. We went for walk after breakfast every morning 5. Snack bar , I loved sitting around pool and having coffee from snack bar We will come back again"
 June 2022,5,My best holiday ever,"Mohammed is the number 1 manager, he looks after all his people. Last but not least Brother Fouhad is the best perosn for excursions , you can find him in the hotel at all times. He’ll sort out your excursions and taxis to the markets."
 June 2022,5,Best holiday I’ve been on,"Very good service and staff. Clean rooms with smart tv. Number #1 tour guide in agadir, sorts out all excursions and transport for a very good price. Mohammed best manager who sorts out any problems with very good service. No problem at all."
 June 2022,5,Amazing Place,"Firstly - Ignore any reviews predating 2021 as place has been completely overhauled and done out. This is THE friendliest place weve ever been. Relaxed vibe, very European feel in nature, all brand new, fresh and clean. Good food. One of the best trips weve had. (Id say its the best place weve stayed, my other half disagrees but this would be in his top 3). Pool: Cold! But is refreshing and once you get in once then the rest of the day in and out is fine even if you dry off. Towels - Are €20 / 200 Dirham to borrow as you cant use ones for the room but just keep them for your holiday and return them on the last day is fine or just bring your own. If you want to pay/return each day then they do get washed so personal choice. We brought our own save any of that hassell! Kids…"
 June 2022,2,general complaint,"We arrived to Agadir airport where we were approached by a gentleman who took our suitcases without our permission to the transfer car, then proceeded to harass us for money. This was the first issue which we found very intimidating. We boarded our car, we sat waiting to leave to be told we were waiting for two other couples - we paid for private transfer that we didn't get, it should of just been us 2. We arrived to the hotel and was told to leave our suitcases are entrance, we where not allowed to take them, we where told to go away to the restaurant to have dinner and come back later to check in, which wasn't a friendly welcome. We checked in eventually and was given our room number, no enjoy your stay nothing. We asked if we could be shown to our room, several minutes later…"
 June 2022,5,Friends Allegro trip June 2022,"The hotel is clean, great service, full of activities and the pool has been brilliant.

 May 2022,5,"Excellent, family friendly hotel","First holiday since Covid at the end of May, and couldn't ask for more. Great location, really friendly staff especially the entertainment staff. Day trips and local reps are recomended and well worth it. All round excellent, kids loved it."
 June 2022,5,"5* review! Amazing staff, amazing hotel.","I'm unsure where to start with this 5* review. From the moment we got to the hotel we felt so welcome! The staff that greeted us were very friendly and happy to help with anything which was an amazing start. Our rooms wasn't ready but we arrived at the hotel at 12pm so that was fine. We were given our all inclusive bands and off we went. When we checked into our rooms we were very surprised, the rooms were lovely and clean. The balcony is a good size and the beds are so big and comfy!! The rooms have lots of lights, a very nice sized bathroom, lots of mirrors and a good sized bathroom.

Room was spacious and had a huge double bed. Wifi is very good which allowed me to work. I will definitely be returning.
 June 2022,3,It is OKAY,"They gave us the crappiest room despite paying for a Superior One. The beach is amazing and has good restaurants close by. Reception is so and so, they speak French mostly so dont blame them. Cockroaches are everywhere. This is more of 3 star not 4."

It was such a lovely thing for them to do and so last minute. Thank you again Muhammad!"
 June 2022,4,Lovely relaxing break,"Just returned from 10 nights at the Allegro Agadir. We arrived early to a lovely welcome from friendly faces. Our rooms weren’t ready but we were given our bands to make use of the facilities. Couldn’t complain at all about the food or drinks, although the continual running out of ice could get annoying. Taken to our rooms which on the ground floor with joint terraces with our friends. Great spotless rooms with lovely views over the garden. Housekeeping service was outstanding. Pool area was lovely, plenty sun beds, snack bar and bar all in close proximity. There seemed to be quite an issue with the plastic edging around the pool breaking when it was trodden on….. my husband being one of them. We then saw 4 others fall through it throughout the 10 days. This obviously needs…"

 June 2022,1,Not worth it.,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Rooms were nice and clean, but rest of the hotel looked bad. Staff was incompetent, receptionist didnt provide us with any informations. Key cards stopped working 3times. We found our room door open two times."

 June 2022,5,Perfect short break ❤️,"We booked this hotel for a 4 day break. Before we left I sent an email letting them know it was my husband’s birthday and our anniversary whilst away . We couldn’t believe how lovely our welcome was and how special they made us feel when we went to our room. just perfect! We had such a lovely stay , with all staff especially Mohammed being so kind and going out of their way to make sure we had the best time . We had a lovely room with a sea view, around the pool there was lots of fun if you wanted to join in and we really enjoyed the food . The position of Hotel Allegro is perfect and we enjoyed nightly walks along the promenade and to the marina. Lots of improvements are being made to Agadir in general but this did not affect our holiday and we would definitely return .👏"
 June 2022,5,Amaizing time 🤗🤗,"great time spent, the staff is very nice and helpful they provided entertainment at the pool every day.

Especially Fouad, he helped me with booking all excursions and anything else I needed. The customer service from Fouad was above and beyond, always making sure everything is good and I am happy with my stay. He made my holiday very enjoyable and easy going. As I was travelling solo I was worried at times but Fouad was very helpful and reassuring. The breakfast has a wide variety of foods and very fulfilling.

All the staff are helpful and always willing to help with a smile! Foud the tour guide is exceptionally good, we booked 3 excursions with him all were Brill! He even helped with a surprise birthday cake and flowers which was a really lively touch. The food was varied and always something for the kids too. There were some maintenance issues such as the air con not working properly but this was dealt with very quickly! We will be visiting Allegro again!"

 June 2022,5,Best hotel!,"Just had a week here, i am well and truly sad that we only stopped for 7 days, the hotel was clean and amazing it was great, Mohammed goes above and beyond for you if you have a problem he sorts it straight away, if the bins need emptying they’re emptied in minutes if the food is low it’s soon restocked, he is the best hotel manager i have seen, the entertainment was amazing, we meet some amazing people on the holiday, this hotel should be a 5 star not a 4 the food is really good, from the manger to the cleaners everyone is soo friendly and they’re just always go out there way to make you smile, we have just booked to go back in February because we enjoyed it that much 😊 Once again thank you Allegro Agadir, you are amazing."
 March 2022,5,Amazing staff,"The rooms and hotel overall were very clean, we went for half board and the food was also nice. The pool area was nice and clean with three different pools. We did not spend much time in the pools as the time we had gone the weather was warm rather than hot and the pool did feel a bit chilly. The staff were absolutely amazing, going above and beyond for us to ensure we were comfortable and having a good stay. I've been to a few hotels but this one was by far the best regarding customer service and looking after guests."
 June 2022,4,Great choice for family with children,"Spent few days with my lovely family in Allegro Agadir, very clean rooms, nice green areas and great stuff. Although it's a beautiful hotel and a great location, I wouldnt recommend it for couples looking for relaxation."
 June 2022,1,Baad experience!,Reception night shift was very unprofessional and rude! I already booked a baby cot and upon arrival he told us that they were all given to other customers since we arrived late!! Next day he did not even bother to resolve some issues that we had and instead he offered to help us to find another accommodation which we did!
 June 2022,5,Excellent service and comfortable rooms,Excellent service and very comfortable and clean rooms. Staff is very helpful. Hotel manager Muhammad is very friendly and helpful. Location of hotel is very convenient close to beach and restaurants. Will definitely stay again.
 June 2022,4,Nice hotel,"The hotel itself is on lovely grounds, its very well kept, clean and the grass is always looked after etc, we booked family room which we found a bit unfortunate that they were placed in the basement with dark hallways and motion sensors that barely work, so the children were a bit scared, but the room itself was lovely and very spacious ( we also loved the body wash provided!) The breakfast was good, nothing amazing but the sort of food youd find at breakfast ; ommeletes, cheese, pastries, pancakes etc, the pool was never overwhelmingly busy but the water was cold, the staff were lovely and helped as much as they could ,the location is great, super close to the beach and has a designated section for the beach but mind that the back gate closes at 11 and you will have to walk…"
 May 2022,5,Great experience,"Just stayed at this hotel with my husband and it's simply amazing! * Cleaning - every corner of the hotel is spotless (including outside) * Staff - don't know there you found this people, but they are amazing! 10 years traveling and we never met anyone who do their job at hotel with so much passion! Soukaina, Yoyo, Jimmy, Eduard and others are superstars who made all the experience absolutely unforgettable. * Food would be great, but 90% of meat and fish was very overcooked and unfortunately was not tasty only because of this. * Pool is supper cold, but don't miss a chance to take a part in water aerobics - so much fun :) * In regards of the trips you will get Farou attention only if you buy more when one trip..."
 June 2022,5,Amazing!,"Wonderful hotel very modern, lots of friendly staff and the food is great. Hotel is nice and clean, good security and pool and lots to do. We dealt with Fouad who was our tour guide, he was extremely helpful and kind, organised lots of excursions and taxis for us."
 May 2022,5,fantastic and memorable holiday to agadir,"My wife children and myself had a wonderful week staying at the allegro agadir hotel, the rooms were super clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful especially Fouad the tour guide he was very helpful especially with arranging the excursion transport. The hotel food was excellent i would recommend the all inclusive package especially if you are traveling with family even though there are plenty of places to eat near by. The whole family loved the wonderful agadir experience and the hotel experience, this has to be the best hotel i have stayed in and i loved the people of agadir they were all very friendly and if all the moroccon people were like this then a big respect to them they represent their country very well."
 May 2022,5,"Value for money, clean, friendly and relazing","Booked a cheap trip via booking.com for 5 nights and we would definitely go back. Food was ample, not the most amazing but still good and something for everyone. Just be aware all inclusive stops at 11pm and water bottles arent available in the rooms so you need to request them. The check in was slow and we had to re do all the forms we had originally done online, The reception staff were a bit slow and distracted, although Said was really helpful! Entertainment staff were great fun and the manager is up for a dance too :) Fab break away and I would definitely go back."
 May 2022,5,Memorable first trip to agadir!,"Me and my wife had an amazing week at Allegro Agadir... the team couldn't be more helpful and welcoming, especially the manager mohamed who went above and beyond to help us out with anything we needed and to make us as comfortable as possible and enjoy our stay there. You will always find him with a welcoming smile and happy to listen and meet any requests to the best of his ability. Also a special mention to fouad the hotels tour guide who was also always ready to help with anything that we needed be it from arranging excursions and restaurant recommendations to tips and advice on how to navigate your way around agadir, he was always a text or phone call away and never refused to offer his assistance. The hospitality we received will forever be cherished and has left us with…"
 June 2022,5,Family holiday June 2022,"We visited Allegro Agadir in June 2022, must say the stay was amazing. The mini club is excellent if you have young children, Nina (lady that runs the club) is so lovely, wonderful with children. All the staff were always on hand to attend to our needs. Definitely recommend it, the food is really good too. Thank you Nina for making my little ones stay extra special"
 June 2022,5,best holiday,Really good hotel for family. They have activities for kids. My son loved it. I recommend to everyone to go there. The guys that does activities makes your holiday even better. We had a nice time . Definitely coming back
 June 2022,5,Amazing experience with wonderful people,"We went for a week long family trip and we honestly can’t recommend this hotel enough! It is a beautiful and clean hotel. The staff go above and beyond to help you out with everything you need. The food is absolutely incredible and so tasty. Everyone who works there is so nice and lovely and they create such an amazing atmosphere. A special mention for the Animation Team. Mouss, Jimy, Ali, Yoyo, Soukaina and others really make the stay amazing. They really take the time to talk with you and get to know you for the duration of your stay. They create so many activities throughout the day to entertain everyone. They are a wonderful, full of energy, funny, very delightful group of people. A very special thanks to you guys! We would 100%, with a clear conscience, recommend this…"
 June 2022,5,Excellent stay,"This was our first trip away in over 2 years due to covid so I must admit I was a little nervous. The hotel is lovely and simple perfect for our 4 nights away. It’s about 30minutes away from the airport so not far. We are use to going to huge resorts so It was quite refreshing how compact the hotel was which was perfect as I was travelling with 3 kids. I was happily able to relax by the pool and watch the kids play in one place. POOL- was lovely although very cold at first, once ur in it’s refreshing. Plenty of sun beds so no need to rush down at the crack of dawn to save a bed. Beach towels are provided for a refundable fee at the end of your trip. FOOD- was lovely, I especially enjoyed breakfast with fresh orange juice and croissants, they make fresh omelettes to your…"
 May 2022,4,Very good value for the price,"Location was good. A mini souk 10 minutes walk away. Beach 2 minutes walk. Definitely reccomend Farou who offers trips. Very reliable and all trips were very good. Room was nice. Pool attendants excellent- they put a stop to any rowdy behaviour in the pool immediately. They also stopped anyone playing their own style of music very loudly. We enjoyed the show cooking of a spectacular fish one night; grilled prawns 3/4 times, paella twice over 2 weeks and roast beef, rabbit and duck once. French night had lovely brie and cured hams too! Manager Mohammad is excellent - always around watching/overseeing. He wants the hotel to reach high standards. As with all All Inclusives, food is repetitive and generally uses cheaper ingredients.. We went out to eat a few times when we needed a…"
 May 2022,5,Loved it too much to go home!,"Wow what an amazing hotel. We only booked for 4 nights and so wished we’d had longer. The hotel was spotless, beds the comfiest ever, food delicious and plentiful with lots of choice, staff were warm, polite and courteous. We were ‘all inclusive’ and the drinks were fabulous at any time of day or night and snacks between meal such as hot fresh doughnuts which were to die for. We had the best time ever with the team of entertainers or ‘Animators’. They made our holiday by their friendliness and inclusion of us in all activities in and around the poolside, yoga (stretches), aqua aerobics, water polo, salsa and even Arabic lessons in the beach bar. The wrong side of 55 we thought the club, or disco, could have been an uncomfortable experience, but oh my word how wrong we were!…"
 May 2022,5,The best vacation I've ever taken.,"The best vacation I've ever taken. The hotel is clean, well equipped, the restaurant is perfect. Everything is just awesome. The best thing for me: was the attitude of the animators. They are all the nicest people I have ever met. I specifically mention the girls and the Mini Club, which was the best. The girls are adorable. I recommend the hotel to everyone, here are the best animators!"
 May 2022,5,Absolutely superb!,"Allegro hotel and all of its staff are absolutely fantastic. We stayed 10 nights at the end of May and can not praise the hotel and all its staff highly enough. The hotel is spotlessly clean and staff take great care of everything. The animation team have been wonderful, so friendly with everyone and making sure everyone has a great time. The hotel manager is also fantastic and really goes the extra mile to help you. The food is very good with lots to choose from. Facilities at the hotel are also very good with a nice big pool, snack bar, football pitch and easy access to private beach which is just across the road. Overall we have had a fantastic holiday and experience at Allegro Agadir and would 100% recommend to anyone."
 May 2022,5,Allegro agadir hotel,"I would recommend this to everyone.. well situated near the beach, well spaced out and very green, exchange shops just then round the corner, mcdonalds 5 minutes away on the each, good out door activities todo"
 May 2022,5,Great entertainment team!!,"The entertainment team is great, all of them: Mouss, Yoyo, Sukima, Nina, Ash and others. They are really trying their best to entertain us and our kids. You can seriously feel first class hospitality here. Also, Mohamed, the manager is a very helpful and decent man. We have a really great fun and spending good time here!! Highly recommended!!"
 May 2022,5,Familly stay in May. ♥️,"Stayed in Allegro for a week on Familly holiday and we were imprest. Hotel very well located within few minutes walk to the beach. Room was very big, very comfortable and very clean. Delicious food. Great selection of dishes always tasty and fresh. Soukaina a restaurant assistant is na absolute GEM. Always smily and very helpful with great approach towards kids. My sons loves her. If you are looking for a relaxing Familly time that's place to go. We definitely will be comming back!"
 May 2022,5,Amazing Allegro,"Last day of an amazing stay. Hotel very clean and staff welcoming. Rooms very modern and well maintained. Maid service daily! The restaurant is well stocked and we were spoiled for choice ! Food looks fresh and inviting. The entertainment staff are something else… they are friendly and helpful and have a full itinerary of enjoyable activities which you can either watch or join in… there is no pressure! We didn’t plan to join in as came away for a relaxing break however we’ve done aqua aerobics, yoga, salsa lesson, Arabic lesson and thoroughly enjoyed all of it! Thankyou entertainment team you are a credit to the hotel . We are TT 2019 and will certainly be recommending this hotel to our friends."
 May 2022,5,Best hotel,The best hotel with the best staff. The hotel is modern and clean. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. Food was also very nice and lots of option. Fuad was very helpful and gave us really good deals for our excursions. He organised everything really well including transport and went above and beyond for us. Would 100% recommend
 May 2022,5,Recommend this hotel to everyone,"I could truly recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to visit Agadir. Me and my boyfriend visited the hotel at the end of May 2022 and we had an amazing stay. All staff members are super friendly, reception,entertainment, etc. We love to go on different excursions during holidays and it was so simple with FOUAD. He welcomed us right at the entrance, gave us welcoming meeting the following morning and showed us all excursions available. He was very helpful with anything we needed, informations, transfers etc. He made our stay so much better. Food was really good, great selection at the buffet restaurant, snack bar and the bar. The hotel itself is really big and beautiful, really good pool, great modern rooms, exit to the beach with private sun beds and umbrellas at no extra…"
 May 2022,4,Jawad and Henna,Overall s great experience considering this was our first holiday with our child. Thank you to Fouad for organising family fun excursions. Great hospitality and everyone was very kind and friendly. Thank you.
 May 2022,5,Amazing staff,First of all I have to say that the people working in this hotel were amazing! The place was cool and tidy but the staff working there (especially one of the managers) were fantastic :) I would totally recommend this place.
 May 2022,5,Fantastic holiday,"Having spent 10 days at the Allegro I can honestly say this has been one of my favourite holiday. The staff are friendly and focused on making your stay a happy one. The manager Mohamed can be seen everywhere ensuring the guests are getting a top service. The hotel is spotless , getting fresh towels daily and rooms cleaned. Staff can be seen maintaining the lovely gardens to a high standard. There is a good choice of foods and plenty throughout the meal times. High on my list is the animation team Beka Zak, Mido Souka Namur Nassira Mounir Mouss. They are friendly encouraging but not pushy to all ages, such fun and always with a smile. I got chance to revisit my salsa and batchata. There is a private area on the beach, the only thing I felt was missing was a beach bar, however…"
 May 2022,4,Recent stay at Allegro,"Myself and a friend stayed here last week for 7 nights. The hotel is in a great position a couple of minutes from the beach which in itself is absolutely beautiful. The hotel is very clean and the staff work very hard to keep everything running smoothly. The first night we were put in a room that was facing the road which was quite noisy so the next day we upgraded to a pool view room for about £30 but was well worth it so I would definitely recommend it. I would highly recommend the excursions which were booked through a lovely man called Fouad who works at the hotel as a sort of rep. He is a absolute credit to the hotel and we booked some fantastic trips through him and anything we wanted to know or needed he was always there to help , can’t recommend him enough! Overall we…"
 May 2022,5,The Best Hotel,"We have been to the hotel several times.The staff is very kind and helpful.The food was very delicious and plentiful.Our room was clean and tidy. Special thanks to the manager, Mohamed Harkouch, he was very guest oriented, kind and helped us in everything during our stay. We will come back! :)"

 May 2022,5,hotel etc.,"came to allegro in 2019 and really enjoyed the stay so we came back in 2022 and its improved a lot more which made this holiday even better. hotel was very clean and the food was different everyday, was nice to try new things and explore our taste buds. our excursions were organised by fouad, he gave us VIP treatment in 2019 and even better treatment this year too. prices for excursions were very cheap thanks to him, would be paying a fortune otherwise😅"
 May 2022,5,Super holiday,"We spent the last 10 days here at the hotel. for the second time. We really like this hotel. the staff is very nice, clean rooms and comfortable, the menu options are very varied and plentiful. I would like to mention the manager Mohammed very kindly and helpfully, we can never ask for something he cannot do. We will be back soon"

This Hotel is clean, safe , modern , and the food and entertainment amazing. This a 4 star hotel with 5 Star standards Credit to all the Staff.. Richard and Mummy.xx"

 May 2022,5,Lovely holiday Amazing value,"Room excellent with a massive ned..bigger than superking! Clean, good size with balcony and walk in shower. If important to you bring your own kettle! Food was excellent for price paid. Plenty of choice and O could always find something different. Good salad bar, main courses and puddings....why no icecream!!? Staff really friendy and helpful. Overall a good value break in the sun. Watch the kiosk oposite the back gate to the beach ( not owned by hotel) the lady there was charging "" rip off prices"" for drinks, sweets etc compared to else where. Very denfensive when questioned....just not acceptable to tourists. Jumbo Tours based in hotel were excellent...some lovely trips out. You may get a bit cheaper else where vut this is a reputable compamy with proper insurance and back…"
 May 2022,5,Mrs Joanna Richardson,Fantastic holiday I’ve never felt so relaxed.lovely staff amazing food.plenty of sun loungers and activities for all ages.Beach across the road with promenade with lots of joggers.I felt completely safe and no one hassles you
 May 2022,5,We Came Bake After COVID and didn't disappoint,"After COVID putting a stop to holidays abroad we were looking forward to getting back to our happy place (Allegro Agadir). The hotel has now completed the modernisation and is now even better! Some new staff and some past staff make for a wonderful stay. They can't do enough for you, always ensuring you have a great time. Mohamed is watching everything and will assist your every need. Food was delicious as before but they have completely had a kitchen/dining area renovation. Fouad, the tour rep from Jumbo Tours is always on hand to help with excursions, general Moroccan info, taxis. Nothing is too much trouble for him, I don't know if he ever sleeps! All in all we were glad to be back and have embraced the new look. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
 May 2022,4,Hotel Allegro,"The only reason why I knocked off a star is because the air conditioner. I didn’t like the initial room I was allocated and the staff were kind enough to swap me into another room with poolside view. Once in the new room the air conditioning wasn’t cool enough, this didn’t get fixed even after 2 reports. Apart from this, the staff were very friendly and very helpful. Found the tour rep is EXTREMELY knowledgeable and helpful, he goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. You can’t go wrong with his suggestions and advice, thank you Brother for your kindness, also to the driver I accompanied on the mini safari, thank you. I will definitely be starting at this hotel in the future."
 May 2022,5,Very Friendly,"Extremely friendly staff, keep everybody safe when out in excursions and very good price. Fouad helped us get the best prices and made sure we stayed safe when outside the hotel. Recommend highly. Hotel service is spot on and no complaints from me."
 May 2022,5,What a beautiful vacation at allegro,Just back from a lovely vacation on hotel allegro.. the food was nice and drinks also was beautiful from the lobby bar simohamed and ali baba they arę a super. The pool was niice also.. my room was always cleen . We definitely recommend IT and we will coming back very soon
 May 2022,5,Fab stay at Allegro,"We booked this holiday after the pandemic and was soo in need of a relaxing break. Allegro did not disappoint. check in was smooth. paid city tax as soon as we checked in. staff very friendly and approachable. Breakfast was very varied and fresh pancakes and omelettes made to your choice. very clean and modern hotel. pool and entertainment team were amazing we just sat by the poolside and watched the boys energy as they entertained the guests. Booked couple of excursions through Fouad who tirelessly works at the hotel making sure you are ok. We asked him for a good tagine restaurant and he drove us there himself and came back to pickup aswell. Hes a credit to the hotel. He also arranged a taxi back to the airport and because he wasn’t there when we left, he rang the driver to…"
 May 2022,2,Disappointed!!,"On arrival, The hotel building is old needs painting, but that's ok.. the check in was painful. We booked our room through Hotels.com. the price included all the taxes and fees imposed by the hotel (Allegro). Have email from hotels.com proving this. However, we were forced to pay the local taxes again, we paid and are taking it up with hotels.com. We requested if we can get the higher floors instead of ground floor. Karim the staff was quite rude and said your room is standard, pay more money and you get upper floor. I tried to explain we booked superior room but was not listening and was just interested in making us pay the local taxes again. We got our room on the 1st floor. The room was pleasant, the bathroom also was OK, but toilet seat was broken. when we lifted the…"
 May 2022,5,One of the best holiday,"Just returned from this beautiful place, we had a absolutely amazing stay here with the best weeks weather, the food was great with plenty of options, the hotel itself was clean and welcoming, the gardens are beautifully maintained and the animations team are the best, keeping everyone entertained day or night. Agadir itself has lots of construction work going on atm but if you look past this, it’s very beautiful place and the Moroccans are very welcoming and friendly, we will definitely be returning!!"
 May 2022,4,Great Entertainment,"This was my first holiday since before the pandemic and i felt it was safe and comfortable with their covid measures. The check-in was easy even though we were very early. The rooms were nicely decorated although the bathroom door did not slide closed. The bars, pool, snack bar, resturant and evening club were all well managed and maintained well. The best part of this hotel is the friendly entertainment staff who work around the pool in the day and the club in the evening. They are very sociable with you and always offering for you to take part in their games. The resturant food always provided good options and was well cooked. The waiting service is swift and the bars serve you in good time. Our balcony was facing the roadside which wasnt the best. However, it didnt dampen our…"
 May 2022,5,Our first holiday abroad since the Pandemic started,"My wife and I stayed in room 1109 at the hotel, for our first ever trip to Morocco. We had a lovely view of the keenly kept green garden, surrounding the swimming pool(s). The hotel is cosy and very clean, following Covid protocols as necessary. It is in a good location, not very far at all from the beach (with an area allocated to Allegro hotel residents). All the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful - especially Mustapha & Manager Mohamed. Staff in the buffet restaurant were also very kind and considerate, as we are vegetarians, so plenty of fries & fresh pizzas were consumed daily, along with some lovely salads and desserts! Thanks to everyone at the hotel for making ours a lovely holiday."
 May 2022,5,Fantastic!!!!,"Just back from a lovely relaxing stay at this hotel, the staff were amazing from the second we arrived to the minute we left. The whole hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms are lovely. Food was good, drinks are quite limited but hey there free lol!! Mini Sahara excursion is worth it as well as the city tour which is only £12 each! Met some amazing people & will definitely return one day! Oh and the marina is a lovely walk down the beach with lots of restaurants and bars."
 April 2022,3,Not bad not great,"There is a big construction in the streets so when you want to walk around it is hard. Also Agadir does not offer much actually. The worst part was our air conditioning was not working, our room was cold at night and we got sick because of that. We told the reception, they said they will call the technicians but nobody showed up really. Whenever we called they answered the same and nothing happened."
 April 2022,5,Fab place to stay at!,"I stayed here for 4 days with my family. As soon as we entered the hotel, the staff were so friendly and welcoming. On the day of the arrival, the hotel allowed us to relax in the lobby while they got our room ready for early check in, which was amazing! The hotel provided entertainment and games every day such as, zumba, table tenis and belly dancing performance so there was always something to do. It was nice to experience the Moroccan culture within the hotel! The Buffet in the restaurant offered different foods everyday, with a good variety. The rooms were spacious, always clean, beautiful view from our room as well. Pool is nice to swim in and the beach is so close as well! Nothing bad to say about Allegro, 10/10 recommend. Allegro Agadir made our first trip to Morocco…"
 May 2022,5,We fell in love with Morocco,"My friend Lydia and I stayed at Hotel Allegro and our hotel representative was Fouad from Jumbo Tours. Fouad was incredible. He was waiting for us on arrival and gave us a lovely welcome. At the meeting he gave us lots of advice. Fouad looked after us every day. He made sure we had everything we need. He organised several trips for us. Nothing was too much trouble for him. We had a private car to a wonderful restaurant in the Habour, we went horse riding and had a city tour. If you visit Morocco then I recommend Fouad with Jumbo tours. We felt like family, such wonderful hospitality. As two women we were very safe and looked after."
 April 2022,4,Treated like royalty,"Me and my wife stayed here for 7 days and the staff could not do enough for us. We requested a change of room early on due to noise from outside, this was arranged very quickly with no bother, thanks to Mohamed. We booked 3 trips through Fouad which were all good especially the camel sunset barbecue. Fouad was very personable and could not do enough for us. My wife forgot her hairbrush so Faoud took her to the shops and even went in himself to get her one. I recommend booking Pure Passion restaurant which was top class but they also provided a shuttle bus there and back from the hotel (booked though Fouad). Even on the last day Mohamed arranged for us to have our room a little bit longer with no extra cost. These rooms were amazing and cleaned everyday with fresh towels.…"
 April 2022,4,The entertainment team are exceptional,So we left the allegro yesterday and I will make my review as honest as I possibly can the check in wasn’t to smooth due to a mix up and a second room I had booked being booked in a totally different name and how early we arrived at the hotel (10am) but the manager Mohammad was fantastic for this he contacted everyone gave us our all inclusive bands and told us to go enjoy the pools etc and would find us as soon as rooms etc were sorted and ready he did this within an hour and as many reviews have previously said he is always everwhere in the hotel chatting and making sure everyone is ok. The rooms for us were great comfortable and for how much time we actually used them they were more then adequate. The food was ok we always ate well and even if people in our group (fussy…
 April 2022,5,The staff is brilliant! They made our trip so much better. Completely recommend it!,"The hotel has very nice amenities. All the staff are extremely nice and they made our stay exceptional! The animation team and Mounir were so much fun and did a great job on getting people to do several different activities, from quizz night, stretching by the pool to learning how to make Moroccon tea. In the bar upstairs Simohamed gave us excellent service, always very friendly. The manager, Mohammed was 5 stars, always ensuring we were ok and having a good time. The food was good and varied at the meals. We definitely recommend it and are coming back! Marlene and Susana, Portugal"
 April 2022,5,Amazing,"don't even know where to start We loved our experience at this hotel! starting with the reception in less than 5 minutes we were in our room ready for dinner! As soon as we arrived we met Fouad who helped us to book our activities, we did a little bit of everything hammam bath, city tour, camel ride, buggy boat trip etc! he was always ready to go the extra mile to see us smile, our new friend in Agadir thank you Fouad for treating us like family! the rooms have giant beds and very comfortable and the cleaning lady cleaned the room every day and changed the towels! reception restaurant swimming pool any corner of the hotel was super clean! the restaurant had a buffet with a variety of food! Now I also really want to thank the manager Mohammed for his fantastic work, he was…"
 April 2022,4,"It was okay, not bad for the price","The reception people were the worst part because most of them they didn’t speak good english and it when we tried to upgrade from breakfast and dinner to All inclusive they asked almost as much as we paid for the reserve. Alcohol and cocktails are very expensive and not that good. The animation staff was very nice as well as the food service. The pool was okay but a bit cold, the beach is windly and also cold but it was great to get to know the culture. Beware of pricing for EVERYTHING, always try to negotiate, even with the hotel rides, they are always overcharging you. Note: of you need to exchange dirams to your money do it in the hotel and not in the airport."
 April 2022,5,Wonderful entertainment staff,"Me and my sister are about to leave after a lovely 4 days in the sun. The hotel is recently refurbished and very modern, clean and tidy. The food was OK. Catered to the masses but tasty. The entertainment staff are the stars of the show so to speak. Always friendly and happy and stopping by to chat. Activities by the pool throughout the day. The calligraphy class learning to write your name in Arabic was good as was learning how to make authentic tagine. The night time entertainment was very good also. Moroccan night and Karaoke was very fun. Thank you Mounir, Beka, Zak, Mahmoud and everyone else for a fab time. The cleaning, waiters and all staff were also very good, nice and friendly and keeping the hotel running. We will back InshAllah"
 April 2022,5,Julie & Charlotte - Fab place to stay,"My daughter and I have just got back from staying at the hotel and what a fab time we have had! We arrived Sunday 24th April mid morning and left about 3 on 27th and during that time we wanted for nothing. The staff are sooo friendly, attentive and really take the time to get to know you. Zac from the entertainment team took an interest in my daughter and I playing Crazy 8’s card game, to the extent he sat with us and played too My daughter then tried teaching him chess.

 April 2022,5,Allegro Agadir,"It's our last day at the Allegro and I can't say I was disappointed. We were greeted by friendly staff at reception and check in was quick, within a few minutes, we were off to our room. The hotel grounds are very well maintained and very pretty to walk around. The pool is clean and tidy with nice lifeguards who were always polite and friendly to the kids. The room is nicely decorated and has been well kept throughout our stay.

 April 2022,5,Amazing stay at Allegro Agadir,"My family have just enjoyed an amazing 9 days at Allegro Agadir. We haven’t stayed at an all-inclusive hotel before but it is the perfect option with teenagers. There are 3 set mealtimes a day, all buffet style with some food cooked in front of you, like omelettes every morning and pizzas every lunch and evening, plus things like kebabs or mussels. Every meal had so much variety and it was all delicious, well cooked and beautifully presented. The tagines and fresh fish were particularly good but don’t think we found anything we didn’t like! The snack bar by the pool has food all day, like chicken nuggets and pizzas. We had two rooms, a double and a family. They were very comfortable and our double bed was vast! They were cleaned every day and a small issue with our shower was…"
 April 2022,5,Holiday in agadir,The entertainment team made our holiday very fun and entertaining. They were very friendly and nice to us making our trip very pleasant for us. We will definitely come again. The food and room was of great standard and we were very pleased with it
 April 2022,5,Great animation team made a great holiday,"We have just stayed at the Allegro for 11 days. My wife, myself and 2 Children (aged 10 & 11) really enjoyed our stay. The weather was lovely, the food was nice and lots of choices but the thing that made this holiday so special was the entertainment staff. From first thing in the morning until last thing at night the Bravo Club team couldn’t possibly do anymore for us all. Whether it was activities around the pool, mini club, just a general chat or providing entertainment in the evenings. The team were non stop. I have to give a special shout-out to Mounir, Namira, Mido and Beka. Their enthusiasm, energy and fun that they gave everyday was incredible. This was made more incredible that they were able to provide all of this during Ramadan. Even though as a British family we…"
 April 2022,5,Morocco 2020,Came here on Tuesday and met the amazing team. Very polite and informative. They gave good advise on the area. The food was exceptional. The snack bar had good food and drinks. The location was very good. The entertainment team made our stay very fun and enjoyable.
 April 2022,5,Ellen,"Very good weather, good team, very informative and active. Very good location. Highly recommended. Amazing food in the morning, lunch and dinner. There is also a snack bar that makes excellent drinks."
 April 2022,5,Amazing hotel and activity team!,First time in Morocco didn’t disappoint! All staff in the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful same with the activity team. Faud organised 4 amazing trips for me and my boyfriend at great prices and we truly made the most of our stay. We will definitely be back :)
 April 2022,5,Very nice and clean hotel to stay ✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️,"This was amazing holiday deal with all family packet. Amazing reception, friendly people and also was a specific guy name Mr. Fouad recommended by my old daughter Sandra, and this guy was and still very much friendly, he took care of me and my family all the time. He's star on this hotel...I recomend any person who comes to Agadir, Morocco to go to hotel Allegro. The Manager Mr. Mohammed very helpful and care about your stay and keep all the time checking if you need extra attention"
 April 2022,5,Lovely hotel,"We stayed at Allegro for a week and the staff were fantastic. Fouhad the manager helped us book trips while we were there and constantly checked in on us. Beka was fantastic with entertainment around the pool and again chatting to us to ensure we had the best holiday. The breakfast is amazing! They fresh cook eggs and omelettes and pancakes every morning and they are very good! The rest of the food is catered to French and Moroccan dishes, it is ok when you get used to it. The rooms are very modern and very clean. However we did have a few issues with the aircon not always working. This could be improved. The hotel is right next the the beach which is lovely apart from sometimes being harassed by people wanting you to buy things, we had to keep our heads down walking passed…"
 April 2022,5,5 star hotel in my eyes,"Lovely hotel very friendly and welcoming staff, can not fault the service here. Mohamed the manger is very helpful and the tour guide fouad jumbo tours group is the reason I enjoyed my stay here and has made sure my holiday was to the best standard. This is my second time here and I have another booked in July."
 April 2022,3,Alright..,"I was here with my couple to enjoy a few days of relaxation. Breakfast is great, we loved the idea of being able to customise your eggs and not have the usual pre-made type. They even had English tea which was a nice little surprise. Dinner is veryyyy average, most evenings were repetitive with options being very restricted. Pasta each night which covered 3 or four of the tuppers available, which was honestly terrible. Little flavour or taste. Loved the homemade pizzas and some of the meats though. Room is very modern, we were given a “nice” downstairs room. Air conditioning does NOT work, we mentioned this to staff member at the desk and his response was that it was “ because it rained last week “. A little bit disappointing for those who suffer in hot degree weather and like…"
 April 2022,4,Great location,"We arrived just before the restaurant closed, they wizzed us down so we didn’t miss tea which was really thoughtful. The rooms are lovely and cleaned daily, they even put our shoes all straight ( we are two messy women😂) Initially we had a room really close to a road which kept me awake , Mohammed was great and gave us a new room. The hotel was half ( or more empty) so I don’t know why they wouldn’t put you in their better rooms. We booked 2excursions at home and 3 through the Sun Holiday rep, his friendly attitude to us totally changed when he saw us waiting for one of our bookings! Not good at all as we were only there a week and paid £120 each to him! ( this wasn’t the hotels fault but gives a bad impression). The food was ok, I’m veggie but there was enough choice.…"
 April 2022,5,Absolutely amazing hotel,"Having the most amazing holiday here at allegro agadir The food is amazing., staff are absolutely fantastic, kids club is fantastic for the little ones. Rooms are lovely and clean. Dont want to go home. will definitely be back very soon. Thankyou to all the staff at the hotel for making our holiday amazing"
 April 2022,5,A great week!!,"We had a great time at Allegro. It's a lovely hotel in a great location - close to restaurants and the sea. The pool is lovely. There is fun entering in the evenings which is great if you want to get involved. The rooms are always clean and have clean towels. The animation staff were friendly and got us involved in games. A special thank you to Zak, Sooki and Namira. They were always happy to help and we had fun in the evenings dancing with them. We found staff on reception very helpful. The manager, Muhammad, we found a little aggressive in his tone when we spoke to him. For example breakfast when we arrived - we were told by reception that we could go for some food but the manager told us we were not allowed. That was fine but we were not being rude so a level of respect…"
 March 2022,5,Great hotel with amazing staff,"Our stay at Allegro was great. It was our first time staying and we are plnning to book again in Oct. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. Reception and security staff said hello every morning and the manager Mohamed Harkouch was always present, we saw him every day helping staff and hotel guests, great manager! The rooms were clean and the food was great. The pool was lovely and the hotel is well maintained. The only issue we found was there are not many options at breakfast if you are gluten or dairy intolerant."
 March 2022,4,a well deserved break - relax,"a perfect place to relax and unwind. after all the restriction this is the place to visit. we had previously stayed at this hotel, so knew the location was ideal. unfortunately a lot of shops and restaurants are still not open, but we were still able to go for a stroll along the promenade and a few excursions."
 April 2022,5,Lovely Week,"Had a wonderful week. Our room was clean, spacious & had a lovely view. If you are looking for a relaxing week 3 minutes away from the beach, then look no further! Staff were amazing! So friendly & helpful, especially Said in reception & Fouad our tour guide. Fouad helped us to arrange our excursions/day trips. We visited during the month of Ramadan & he gave also gave us some sweet treats that his wife had made as a gift! Just to add that on our day trip to Marrakesh we had an amazing, knowledgable & humorous guide called Mohammed who really made the trip special!"
 April 2022,5,Moroccan getaway,"We had a warm welcome. Fouad provided useful information about Agadir, as well as organised our trips and transport to make sure everything was effortless!! Fouad went above and beyond to help us enjoy our stay and really help us experience Moroccan culture. We enjoyed a Hammam + Massage, also getting to do a buggy excursion through the mini Sahara. The animation crew from the hotel were super friendly, nice to chat to and the food incredibly delicious. Every lunch and dinner was different! Allegro is a great destination for people who are looking for an all inclusive stay to relax by the pool, but also a great place for those who would like to go and explore Agadir and further. A twenty minute walk from the hotel is the local Souk(market), transportation can be organised,…"
 April 2022,5,1 week great holiday,"We had a great stay at the Allegro. The room was spacious and had a good sized terrace with a lovely view of the green garden and the pool area. We really enjoyed the food - buffets 3 times a day plus drinks and snacks at the bars in between. The staff was fantastic, always smiling and wanting to please. A particular thanks to Fouad, the coordinator of the excursions that you can book extra. We had such a wonderful time riding camels followed by a sunset dinner, visiting Tiznit and Taroudant as well as the local sights in Agadir. The locals were all very friendly and welcoming. A great holiday, highly recommended."
 April 2022,2,Adequate- no frills week in the sun but we won't ever be back,"Finding a decent hotel (short haul) at this time of year for guaranteed sunshine to escape the British spring can be tricky - the canaries seemed v expensive so we took a punt on Agadir. The Allegro seemed to be the best location wise and on reflection I think it is. It's a 2 minute walk back from the beach (over a road) and about a 30 minute walk to the marina area - along a very good promenade. The opposite way along the beach out of the hotel has other hotels we had considered but were all a lot more expensive. We arrived fairly early on our first day - some miscommunication at the reception desk meant we thought we could get some breakfast having been up for about 8 or 9 hours - as I grabbed a couple of pastries and a coffee, I was approached by (I assume the manager) and…"
 April 2022,3,You get what you pay for,"This a genuine you get what you pay for experience Having done high-end inclusive holiday, this was a last minute cheap 5 days in the pre-season sun jolly. I honestly could not imagine this place at full capacity, it would be my hell on earth. The pool area would not cope with a full hotel, neither could the 'restaurant' in my opinion. The size of the pool area looks too small to cope with a full house; obviously depending heavily on the nearby beach to take a lot of the punters. The food in the restaurant was not great, we ate out every night, which should tell you something. Management staff shouting at workers in front of paying guests was not good to see. The bar area was also the performance area, which is a problem when you go up to the very small and badly positioned bar.…"
 April 2022,5,Early bird,We came to Agadir for an early break. Weather was good plenty of sun. The hotel is excellent with friendly staff and very clean. Food was also excellent but variety is needed to cater for differing nationalities. The holiday rep Fauad was very friendly and helpful. Advised us of things to be weary of and to avoid.
 March 2022,5,Amazing Service,"Hi, I throughly enjoyed my recent visit and the service was wonderful . Upon arrival i was met by Fouad who was very nice and welcoming and ensured we had something to eat and drink . Fouad was excellent through the our trip and was helpful at all times . All excursions and taxi rides were booked through him . I would advice to speak to him first as there are many people trying to scam you on the beach . The hotel was nice and food was great . Staff at the hotel were very accommodating. Great place to visit and right next to the beach. I would rate it 8.5/10 Thanks Ajaz"
 March 2022,3,A nice hotel with friendly staff but maintenance needs improving,AC not working during my stay and there was no telephone in the room to call the reception desk. Although I got changed to another room but same problem the weather was really hot and the AC wasn't working. They offered a late check out and afternoon lunch on the last day of Checkout. They oalso offered free city tour
 March 2022,5,MY FIRST TRIP TO MOROCCO,"Allegro Hotel was the best time,so lovely people and friendly plus the management Mohamed and the tour guide Fuad very nice guys !the best service very clean room ,sheets etc. The most loving and respectfu people .

 March 2022,5,Loved it at Allegro Hotel!,"Amazing service, we got all inclusive, so restaurant in the morning and evening was amazing. Workers are very friendly and very helpful. Fouad (Tour Guide) Showed us great high-quality time at excursion services. Hotel was extremely clean as well as rooms as they were cleaned on a daily basis. Lots of stuff to do like sun bathe and swim in the big pool, play basketball / table tennis / darts / karaoke / disco , etc with other people and workers. The best service, respectful and most loving people at this hotel. Safety and cleaning is top at this hotel."
 March 2022,5,FIRST EVER TRIP IN MOROCCO,"BEST HOTEL EVER ! The best service , respectful and most loving people at this hotel. I have been staying with my family at this hotel for 6 days and i have been treated like royalty at this hotel. Safety and Cleaning is top at this hotel , every morning - room cleaned + bedsheets and fresh towels. The manager at this hotel is named Mohammed and the best Travel Guide is Fouad who has helped us with the best experience here in Morroco , guided us to different places and adventures here in Agadir. The hotel has the best food cuisine and amazing swimming pools to tan !! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
 March 2022,5,Excellent service,"We stayed in Agadir for a week at Allegro Hotel, did a bit of research before we came on what activities we might fancy doing but Faoud found us on our first day and took care of all the hassle of booking excursions. He defiantly made this trip amazing for us, really looked after us. Recommended lovely restaurants to try, really went above and beyond for us. If you are thinking about visiting Agadir this is the place to stay!"
 March 2022,4,"Fresh, clean and modern hotel!","The hotel is nice, fresh and modern and in a good location. Very clean rooms and facilities, a credit to the housekeeping team and gardeners who we saw working hard. We had a problem with the electric tripping in our room several times and had to move rooms the second to last day, bit frustrating, but the reception team helped and we were given a late checkout as a gesture of good will from Mr Mohammad. The food was always fresh and offered key staples each meal time. We personally didn’t like to eat in all the time but that was our choice. The restaurant team are efficient and ensure the area is spotless at all times. The pool area again was always spotless, a lifeguard was in attendance each day. Slight downside in that the pool bar was also meant to double up as a…"

All the staff are happy and friendly. The animation team were especially bubbly. Must mention ,Mustapha on reception. Nothing was too much trouble. Thanking you all. Jack and Brenda. Williamson"
 February 2022,4,Escape to the Sun,"We were immediately impressed by the large area of the hotel, the brilliant flowers on our pathway to the restaurant, well-maintained gardens, our room size and balcony, the proximity to the beach and the peace and quiet of our room (see below). We were late arrivals (Ryanair) : the night-time receptionist was extremely understanding and gave us excellent service. Our telephone did not work, and despite many reminders to the Duty Manager and daytime Reception, it never worked throughout our stay. Avoid the breakfast coffee machine ... stay with the local mint tea. There are 3 important negatives here: 1. We were never informed that the price we were quoted on the Hotel website avoided any mention of additional payments to be made onsite at the hotel itself. We paid this demand…"
 March 2022,5,Best vacation ever,"Amazing staff and hotel. I will comeback again in summer for sure. Special thanks to Mohamed the duty manager, who was there for us from the check in to the check out. He always made sure that our experience is unforgettable."

We'll definitely come back to Allegro and we'll advise our friends and relatives to do so. Last but not least, we'd like to thank all the staff for their kindness, above all M. Mohamed."
 August 2021,5,Family stay at Allegro,"Returned last week from a fantastic holiday at the Allegro with my 2 Sisters and Niece. This was for my Sisters 60th and a re-boot for the rest of us after the challenging year we have all had. I think that we were the only British family there, mostly French and Moroccon but we were made to feel special and welcome. I think the hotel was mostly a British hotel prior to Covid and I hope that everyone returns when travel is less complicated although we found that as long as you knew what you were doing with the test before you leave and when you get home it was plain sailing. The hotel printed out everything we needed in order to have everything ready at check-in. The biggest of thanks from myself and my family go to Sonia and Bea the two hotel Managers, no question or (small)…"

A whole new animation team who made our stay relaxing as they were fantastic with our son. We were greeted by Mohamed Harkouch - everyday on multiple occasions he would ask us how our stay was going. He was more than happy to assist us in anything that we needed. The swimming pool was kept spotless. Just ate the back door and a cross the promenade you're on the beach. Agadir marina is just a 10-minute walk There were daily activities around the pool plus mini club for the children In the evenings -…

 February 2020,5,"Myself, my husband and our three year old loved it!","Myself, my husband and our three year old visited the Allegro Agadir hotel in February for seven nights and loved it! The staff are very friendly, and they are constantly cleaning! There is one non-heated swimming pool, one smaller heated one and a non-heated paddling pool for kids. There were always sun loungers available. The beach front is a couple of minutes away across one road with a separate exit towards the back of the hotel complex. There is a sectioned-off part of the beach for the hotel customers. There was a good selection of yummy food available for every meal. The food was only repeated once, I think. There were always freshly cooked options available such as a BBQ or fried eggs/omelettes. The only negative thing about the food was that the fish usually had…"
 February 2020,5,incredible hotel,"visited this hotel in February for a week and had a great time. all the staff are brilliant but the animation team are absolutly fantastic. extremely friendly. make time to come and sit and chat with the families and great with the kids. the kids dancing at night is great but could do with being abit longer. hotel and grounds are very clean and well looked after. food was good, all made freshly. we have just booked to return in February again and cannot wait. iv seen the restaurant has all been refurbished as this was underway while we was there. so can only guess it will be even better. see you next year. :-)"
 February 2020,5,Kirsty Smith,Had a fantastic 2 week holiday here in February. Lovely hotel with gorgeous food and really lovely staff especially Mohamed Harkouch who went out of his way to help us. The entertainment team were brilliant with so much energy and always smiling. Location was perfect for us as so close to beach and shops and restaurants. We have already booked to come back next February again as we loved it so much. Thanks to the staff for making our holiday so great 😀
 February 2020,3,good,"nice hotel. greatest thing is the staff who are amazing. the drink selection small but nice. the rooms are ok, beds are so comfortable, even if the the rooms a little dated. food is average. if your a fussy eater isnt the best but there is plenty to eat and the food is good quality. the pool is ok the smailer one is heated but the larger one is freezing. the entertainment is good. over all i liked the hotel and i would def book again as it is mega cheap. we went in februay so the best thing was the weather."
 January 2020,1,Would not return,"Where do I even start, I was so looking forward to this holiday and it was well and truly ruined! We had to move rooms and both rooms we were in only 1 socket that worked! The first room we were in the fridge didn’t work and was jammed into the cupboard which you could barely get into. We were initially put in room 221 which is below the main bar. If you get put in this room request to move ASAP! The noise of chairs moving is absolutely horrendous all day and all night you literally can’t sleep and the corridor outside is so noisy! The bar closes at 11pm and on our first night the lights were turned off and we were on the balcony drinking and were told to drink and leave how rude! Not a very good first impression at all! We paid for all inclusive and it was the worst thing we…"
 February 2020,5,Great to be back,"Our 3rd visit to this gem of a hotel. After a trouble free flight and transfer it was lovely to be welcomed back by Mr Mohamed and other familiar faces. Check in was swift and easy, given the same room that we had in November, a welcome bowl of fruit and bottle of sparkling wine was a nice gesture and much appreciated. The dining room was closed for renovation but the staff did a brilliant job serving meals in marquees attached to the disco area. A good varied choice of food, hot, cold or BBQ. Management were much in evidence checking the guests were happy. The animation team often sit with guests at dinner, a friendly gesture that gives you the chance to learn more of their culture and them as individuals. Waiting staff were as usual cheerful, friendly, helpful and do their…"
 March 2020,4,Cut short visit,Arrived 14th March had to pay £40 so called tax which we were unaware of.. The hotel overall was nice but with alot of construction work going on alot of banging drilling etc not very relaxing by the pool then with the Corona virus getting into full swing and our flight been cancelled we had to visit the local man who worked for the consulate trying to get back to the UK. So the entertainment was cancelled you couldn't use the pool and food and bar's were restricted so not alot of choice but the rooms were large clean and very comfortable with a fridge bathroom was clean and plenty of hot water.. The food was OK but don't think we really got to see this hotel at its best the staff were very friendly and helpful and would probably like to go back to see it when everything gets…
 March 2020,5,"Great hotel, great holiday","First inclusive holiday we've been on and what a fabulous experience. Food wise tremendous and lots of vegetarian options. We asked to swap our room for a pool view which was no problem. The room change did make all the difference. Cannot fault the staff. They were all great. A special thank you to Mohammed, we think he was part of the Management team. I don't know when he slept as he was constantly on hand for any queries/problems (immaculately dressed), that was Mohammed. Once again, thank you Allegro Hotel for the most fabulous time and hope to see you in November with more of our family members, hopefully, after this awful coronovirus."
 March 2020,4,Girls Trip,"11 ladies on a ladies holiday stayed at the Allegro Agadir hotel March 2020. An amazing time was had by all. Manager, Mohammed and his staff worked very hard to ensure concerns were addressed to the best of their ability to ensure our satisfaction. One of our ladies celebrated her birthday while we at the hotel and staff pulled out all the stops to ensure her birthday was celebrated in style. We want to thank management and staff for their efforts and wish the hotel the very best with their future plans. Thank you all very much."
 March 2020,5,Amazing Holiday,"Came back last week, after a fantastic holiday with friends. the hotel was spotless, the food was lovely everything was just great. The staff cant do enough for you brilliant, any problems sorted out straight away by the manager who is so professional and always puts guests first. Rooms abit dated but they are redecorating this year but very clean, pool, resturant all the facilities just perfect. Our whole experience of the Allegro and Agadir was fantastic. To all the staff including the enterainment crew you are doing a fantastic job loved every minute of our stay, and as soon as we are able we will be coming back definately"
 March 2020,5,Extremely brilliant in such a chaotic time,Firstly I want to thank Sonia mohammed an the other gentleman in his office We were booked here for a week and was enjoying our holiday when this virus thing exploded through out the world not just Morocco Sonia Mohammed and there team should be proud of how they conducted themselves during this manic time Firstly they were calm and professional throughout explaining what was going on at all times Yes they had protocol to follow pools closing bar restrictions it wasn’t there doing it was there government telling them so our family group totally understand there position but when speaking to Sonia an mo on a daily basis they reassured us if we left for the airport and didn’t get a flight we would be welcome back. Now on to the hotel yes their is work going on but it didn’t…
 March 2020,1,The Coronavirus is not our concern! Seriously?,"The property is ok but unlike advertised it is not beachfront like resorts are in Mexico or cuba! You have to 'leave' the resort, cross a street and plaza to get to the public beach where they have a ringed section . Secondly, without even asking us we were given an appointment of a tour guide the following morning.. to sell tours. I understand the model for hotels is to have extra revenue through tours but the customer should get a choice before a forced appointment. But that was not the reason why we were really annoyed at the resort and manager. When we were there the corovirus crisis hit and the countries started shutting borders. We had to leave while we could and every from the airlines to the car rental companies were supportive but not this hotel! We mentioned that have…"
 March 2020,4,Great value holiday,Stayed at the Allegro in March. This hotel is great value for money . The restaurant was undergoing refurbishment but we loved the quirky set up. The food was good the staff were excellent and the room was good with a huge balcony. We will definately go again. Dont bother taking towels rent for your stay for £20 and get a full refund when you leave . The main pool was cold but there is a smaller heated pool. Got home just in time to beat the airline shutdown. I would have given this hotel full marks however it took from Saturday till Tuesday to get a safe. Reception should have sorted out sooner. Other than that perfect.
 March 2020,5,Wonderful holiday and just got out of Morocco in time March 2020,"We have just stayed here for 10 nights. Although the hotel is a little dated it is very clean and tidy, as you come to expect in Morocco. We stayed whilst the restaurant was being renovated and the food was served in tents, yes tents. We had a very varied selection of food over our holiday and most of it was piping hot. The team did a fantastic job given the position they were in. The pool area is bigger than the impression you get from the pictures and is very hot due to the lack of a breeze most of the time. All alcohol is ‘local’ but we found it to be very good but limited to vodka, gin, rum and whiskey with some cocktails. The biggest disappointment was the snack bar but this was more about the queue rather than the service, just the layout of the bar. We did enjoy the…"
 February 2020,5,Great experience,Great holiday excellent staff and entertainment team. Would definitely return again. Amazing weather for March. Very clean. Excellent food and lots of choice even though they were doing renovation to the restaurant.
 March 2020,4,"Good hotel, good food, good staff.","Had a thoroughly enjoyable week at the Allegro Agadir hotel in Agadir. Rooms are standard but comfortable and kept spotless by the cleaners. There is a big renovation project going on which will finish at the end of the year. This does not affect anyone staying there. The entertainment team work hard with something going on all day. Staff are polite and friendly and ensure service is quick and efficient. All areas are kept clean with staff regularly sweeping up. My husband was in a wheelchair after suffering from a stroke but everyone on the staff helped him when they could, even the security guards. Both the Manager, Duty Manager and Jumbo rep were quick to help us with a couple of incidents that occurred. The Love Holiday Rep was a waste of space. He took our money…"
 March 2020,5,A fantastic stay,"What a great little hotel, price very good, all Inclusive food and drinks were good, 2 minute walk to private beach, staff were so friendly, a perfect couples holiday, no hen or stag parties there - highly recommended for families and couples."
 February 2020,5,Great hotel,"I have just come back from a very enjoyable 2 week stay at this hotel. The location of the hotel is excellant, Less than a five minute walk to a private beach. A few restaurants and bars nearby. The hotel and room were spotless. All the staff were very friendly. Good choice of menus at meal times. I am looking forward to going back later in the year."
 March 2020,5,What a brilliant holiday!,"We arrived on an all inclusive break and were treatred wonderfully from the moment we arrived at the Allegro. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly and were on hand 24/7. The facilities at the hotel were excellent even during a major refurb and update everything was well organised. The food was great with a good and varied selection everyday. One of the great things about the hotel is its location, literally across the road from the fabulous beach where there is a nice sectioned off area for hotel guests. You can stroll right donw the promenade and to the marina. On the other side of the hotel you are just 50 yards from some very nice bars. We will definitely be back! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone"
 March 2020,5,Fantastic 10 days! Highly recommend!,"Currently sat waiting for our transfer to the airport, reflecting on an amazing 10 days!! Before we came, I did what we all do and read the reviews, there were  some questionable ones which did concern me slightly, I really do not know where these reviews came from 🤷 From arriving late on a Saturday night to leaving today we have had the best time! The rooms are clean, and bright, great shower! The pool area is fab, plenty of lounges & brollies, clean pools, 1 heated which was great. The weather has been incredible, sun sets past 7pm 👌 Food fabulous, a great choice, alot of traditional dishes, which is what you would expect coming abroad but also plenty of other options. Drinks great, plenty of choice, the bar staff at the snack bar we're fantastic and get to know what you…"
 February 2020,5,Amazing!!,Spent 10 days and this resort and they were great! To start with rooms they were spotless every day and all amenities provided. Hotel also has a little spot on a beach which is 4mins walk from the hotel Food was incredible! A massive selection of food for anyone’s taste every day 3 times a day. Different specials and soups every day. A special thanks to waiter Hamza iks who took care of us most of our dinners. He made sure our glasses were never empty and was smiling even though sometimes we stayed after hours. There are two adult and one kids pool so at least in late February all the guests had enough space to play in the water. Pool bar has snack area too where you can grab some freshly made pizza or doughnuts. Also pool bar has it’s star bartender Lhabib who is always…
 February 2020,5,10 Amazing days,"The resort is one of the best I've ever been. The room was spot clean and we found some fresh fruit waiting for us after a long trip! The staff is amazing. The bartender of the Snak Bar at the pool,Lhabib, make me and my friend have amazing time with his delicious cocktails:) The animation team where so much fun with their dance and music. The buffet always spot on and fully refilled with fresh and tasty food. The fish is delicious. But our hero is been the Manager of the hotel MoHamed Harkouch since our friend lost his passport the last day, he couldn't help enoug. He personally sort this out, helping us with phone calls, runs to the police station and eventually be able to find my friend's missing passport. One of the best holiday. Thanx Allegro"
 February 2020,5,Beyond our expectations,"We stayed at the allegro agidir and it was the most wonderful hotel. The entertainment/animation team where so much fun and made the holiday. The manager of the hotel Mohamed Harkouch was very helpful and couldn’t do enough for us! Especially since my friend had no suitcase for 2 days! He personally sorted this out for us arranging airport runs. The love holidays rep was rubbish and very rude telling my friend it’s not his problem and to get herself a taxi to go to the airport daily to collect her case. The hotel is currently having renovations completed with no disturbances to us. The food was immense and the hotel was spotless, with maids changing our rooms and bedding,towels daily. We have booked to go back in December!"
 March 2020,4,Better than some would make out.,"I booked this hotel for a cheap winter break for me and my dad. The hotel was excellent for its overall service and quality in relation to what we paid. Firstly the food, if you want bacon sausage egg. And beans every day Agadir isn’t for you. However if you want quality local food with a broad selection of Tangines seafood served with couscous potatoes rice and vermicelli noodles. You won’t go wrong. The rooms are a tad dated with refurbs taking place in the block adjacent to the pool. They were cleaned everyday with fresh towels and no other problems. The entertainment guys do a good job with clearly a restricted budget there was no “professional” shows while we was there ( I say this a little tongue in cheek as even in top hotels these can be naff) However the guys do the…"
 February 2020,4,"Nice Hotel, Hardworking staff","We have just returned from the Allegro Hotel, our room was very clean with a good view of the gardens .The Hotel is having some refurbishment including the dining room which was closed whilst we was there .At times it felt as thought you were on top of each other i think it will be better once the dining room is finished . The food was ok you could always find something you liked. The pool bar you can get Pizza & Chips during the day and it was always freshly cooked. There are plenty of sunbeds around the pool area and the staff work very hard to make you feel welcome, Mohammad the manager is always on hand to talk to and deal with any complaints you may have and resolves them ASAP .I would certainly return to this Hotel."
 February 2020,4,Allegro hotel stay in February 20,"The staff and management in this medium sized hotel are Exceptional in their friendly manner and positive approach. However, the building itself is extremely dated but is undergoing a major refurbishment. It could do with a few more things onsite such as a proper spar/gym and bars. At the moment it’s definitely a 3 star Establishment but I’d be interested to see what it is like next year when I return."
 February 2020,4,Amazing for the price we paid,"Hotel was clean, dated yes but when it's gorgeous weather outside who is inside! (beds were super comfy) Food was delicious. Drinks was limited on selection but good enough. Cocktails were poor :( Many people saying that they cater more to the French, not true! You get what you give, a smile and manners go a long way ( and the odd tip definitley helps) All the staff work hard and were very accomodating, the entertainment staff work really hard BUT would like to be left alone a little more and not have swimming pool noodles slammed so hard on the ground next to us, made us jumped every time and not that funny! (The evening entertainment wasn't fantastic, but we were with friends and you make of it what you want, we had a blast!) Over all I would reccomend this hotel and will…"
 February 2020,3,Good Holiday at Allegro hotel in Agadir,"We ran away the Finnish winter with friends, and chose this hotel based on the location, reviews and all-inclusive rates. The location of the hotel is good, close the beach and town centre, very convenient to golfers hence free golf buses to most of the Agadir Golf Clubs stop just behind the fence of the hotel. Allegro Agadir hotel has its own beach site along the nice Beach Promenade. The service at the hotel is good. Staff does their best for the guests. Only in the busiest days there was some hassle in the restaurant, but understandable. Duty Mgr Mohamed was everywhere throughout our 4 weeks holiday, ready to assist us guests and got things moving with the least of noticing by anybody. Animation team does great work throughout the day. The evening shows were mainly…"
 February 2020,2,Don't expect a lot from this hotel,"Rude and argumentative staff. Not all, but be warned. The hotel seem to generally cater for the French . Some staff members complained about the rudeness of their colleagues. Some staff were good but most do not bother with the guests, not even a smile"
 February 2020,5,Allegro hotel best holiday accommodation,Muhammad was very helpful and friendly hayyat was friendly and helped us enjoy the full holiday experienced the waiter jalila was kind and helpful live music and the theatre shows were also a very good addition as it made the holiday surreal and I am impressed with how good the cleaner najat were at cleaning the room and was always smiling and welcoming. Would 100% recommend 😁
 March 2020,5,Boys holiday,I enjoyed my time in allegro hotel agadir very good animation staff especially hayat she was amazing and also very delightful duty manager mohamed harkouch he was amazing security was great i wasnt much breakfast pretty much the same food but everything cant be perfect still but i enjoyed my self and special the best out of all the people was the cleaner najat she was awesome
 February 2020,5,"Amazing place, Amazing people","We had a fantastic family holiday at this hotel! All the staff go out of their way to make sure you're okay...nothing is too much trouble. To name a few, Ziko, Walid, Nores, Youseff & Abir are always lively and smiling, the daily activities were fun and inclusive. Hyatt was great in the kids club! The customer service in the restaurant doesn't go a miss either, especially the smiles from Simohammed and his colleagues. Will definitely be visiting this place again! Shania"
 December 2019,4,New Years,"Had a few issues on my first night staying in the hotel, but was very quickly resolved. The food was brilliant and the entertainment staff were fantastic with my daughter. Would highly recommend for new year!"
 February 2020,4,Fantastic week in the sun,"We have just returned after a week in Agadir with 2 kids aged 2 and 13. Transfer was about 30 mins from the airport. On arrival, at around 8.30pm we were immediately given our all inclusive bands then ushered away from reception, which we did find abit confusing, but in fact we were taken to the restaurant. A cold beer and some food for the kids were very much appreciated. We headed back up to check in properly and pay the tax. We paid 375dirham. The family room was huge,a king sized bed, 2 single and a small seating area. Wardrobe space is a bit limited for 4 people,could benefit from a few more hangers. The room we had hadn't been updated yet, the bathroom was a little dated but clean and spacious. The pool area is clean, spacious and heated pool was great for the little…"
 February 2020,5,All round great place,"We’ve just got back and I had to write a review as it seems that the hotel gets a bit of bad press. The rooms are perfect size and are cleaned everyday. With how the weather is I doubt that anyone would be spending much time in the rooms. The bed was probably the best one I’ve ever slept in. Perfect location. Every single one of the staff go out of their way to help and are always smiling. Yes, there are refurbishments going on at the moment but that was never a problem. Walk out of the bottom gate and you are on the seafront and the hotel has its own bit of beach that is cordoned off. Food is always different each day and is lovely. And the waiters are always there in the evening for all your requirements. All in all a great place and we are looking at going back."
 February 2020,4,Nice place to stay for a family,"Very pleasant stay,fab staff,great bravo club team,hotel wuiet outdated and tired and thats the only downside of this place(doesnt look anything like 4 star hotel) but service is 5 star or more,so overall Im satisfied.Thank Uou"
 February 2020,4,Great holiday,"We visited Allegro 12-19th Feb. There was us as a family of 4 with 2 children and we were with another family of 5 with 3 children. Hotel was nice. In a little state of transition as lots of building work. Rooms were basic but clean. Food was on the whole very nice although a couple of meals weren’t great. But plenty of choice and all fresh and tasty. Pool are was nice and no problems getting sun beds. Heated pool was nice too. Location is good. Few bars and shops nearby and only a short few mins walk to more stuff. Drinks on the all inclusive weren’t great and all served in crappy plastic glasses. Entertainment team were great. Made lots of effort and well liked. Youssef, Ziko and Nores were amazing. Only issue we had and stopped 5 stars was the evening…"
 February 2020,5,Half term family break,"To be honest, I dont know where to begin. It was such a great hoilday many due to excellent staff and high level of customer services. I especially want to thank, Mohamed harkouch ( duty manager) as I lost my mobile and credit card etc, he was so help (he went the extra mile) and also the reception staff were great also. The room were clean and the food was great also. Location of hotel is prefect. Only constructive feedback I can say is that deco is dated, but I didnt mind as hotel was clean.thank again for making this one of the best family hoilday we had. Hopeful we plan to return next year"
 February 2020,5,Fantastic Place!,"This hotel is fabulous. Our room was cleaned every day & the whole place is very well maintained. The staff work super hard to ensure everything is as it should be. Thank you to Mohammed (manager)- he deserves a medal. Nothing was too much trouble from the moment we arrived until we left. Special thanks to the animation team-Whalid,Yousef,Nores,Abir,Najwa, Riko & Karim for keeping the whole family entertained. Take the time to look at any photos taken by Yassine (photographer)as they're really good value. The pool bar is lovely-thanks to the hardworking staff;Sana, Lhabib & Labi The restaurant has a very good selection of food & runs smoothly even when busy. Allegro Agadir is definitely a hotel we will return to. Shukran!!"
 November 2019,5,Amazing stay,"Words can’t describe our wonderful stay at Allegro Hotel. From the first day we arrived, we were introduced to great hospitality, service and kindness from the staff. We wouldnt have had the same joy of experience in Agadir without staying at Allegro Hotel. The All-inclusive deal is great, as the food is delicious at every meal, with all kinds of fresh vegetables, fruits, couscous, meat and great side dishes. You will also get the opportunity to enjoy coffe, soft drinks as well as fresh cocktails and snacks/small meals during the day by the pool. The rooms are amazing and clean, the wonderful garden forms around the pool as a beautiful oasis, and the architecture of the hotel has a royal and cultural touch. Very elegant! Dance and creative cultural events are being arranged in…"
 February 2020,4,Anne,Very nice hotel near city and the beach. Tasty drinks and food! Staff were really friendly.The room needed an upgrade but still cosy and functional. Pool area is clean and nice. Safety box was difficult to use.
 February 2020,4,Sunny getaway in Agadir,"Arrived at the hotel very friendly reception and shown to our room. Can't say we were overly impressed with the room. Though large enough all a bit tired and in need of an update. Having said that everywhere was kept clean by the hard working staff. Couldn't fault the staff in everything they did. Restaurant food was exceptional, different types of meals each night. Our return flight to the UK was cancelled due to bad weather but the management tried everything to get us sorted with another hotel and flight. They went out of their way to assist Would recommend this resort hotel for a lively break"
 February 2020,5,Hotel Allegro,"I stayed here with my family for 1 week and we had such a blast of a holiday. Not only the atmosphere but also the food is way to delicious with lots of variation day by day. The service is top as well, if you got any problem they will solve it directly. Mohammed, the manager of this hotel is very friendly and takes care of everything. During dinner he passes by every table to ask if everything is ok, this ‘little thing’ makes me feel like home. Thanks a lot for everything Mohammed, you will see me back VERY soon 😊 Sofie"
 February 2020,4,Great value for money,"Just about to leave after a week's start. There's been some renovations going on this week so it's not fully open, but not very disruptive. We paid rock bottom prices, so I'm basing it on that. The food was very good we thought, and we're very much into eating and cooking international cuisine. We only eat out twice the whole week, though there are plenty of cheap restaurants nearby. The staff are almost entirely very friendly, the animation crew particularly. Though we aren't really interested in joining in things, but they didn't hassle us too much. The drinks are what you'd expect - weak spirits, local beer and wine, but the wine was actually really good, the rosé in particular. The pool area is great too, lots of sunbeds, no issues finding one, but only half the rooms…"
 February 2020,5,Would definitely return to this hotel,We stayed in this hotel 1st Feb to 8th & had a fantastic time. All the staff are really nice. The animation team work so hard & are all so lovely they fussed over the children & made us feel really welcome they were fantastic with my mother in law who is in a wheelchair & they involved her in everything making her holiday very special. We enjoyed the shows every evening & it was great that drinks were even provided in the arena. The beach is beautiful & just across the road from the back of the hotel. We especially liked the pool area the middle pool was heated & was very pleasant to swim in. The weather was fabulous late 20s everyday. The free WIFI was available across the full hotel with great reception even in our room. If you experience any problems the manager is always…
 January 2020,5,Beyond our expectations to be honest,"We had read some iffy reviews but then again there are always negative people out there! We like to go with an open mind and are very prepared to make allowance for less than good things if there are excellent services to compensate. Staff were superb, food was unbelievably good, better than anticipated. My brother had spent the first 2 weeks in January in room 440 and a week or so after he left we arrived and were allocated room 437! The room was fine, really needs an overhaul but one of the hotel blocks is currently being refurbished so bit by bit the whole place will be sorted. The bathroom was excellent, even had a bidet! Water pressure and temperature were super, the shower was simple and effective. Shampoo and soap were provided. Staff were the highlight and I would…"
 February 2020,5,5* excellent hotel,"Had a great time in Agadir first time going but was really nice place. Staff are really nice, food was really nice loads to choose from drinks had all cocktails and slush puppies heated pool and would definitely recommend any 1 to visit this hotel 👍🐫☀️🍺🏖"
 February 2020,5,Amazing Hotel!!!,"This was our second time visiting Allegro Agadir and this visit was just as amazing!! we visited in December 2019 and liked it so much we rebooked the trip for February 2020. The whole team at the hotel all are incredibly friendly, including manager, cleaning staff, entertainment team and all the staff in the restaurant. In addition to this, all the rooms were cleaned regularly and were up to a high standard of cleaning. if we needed anything, all staff would go above and beyond to make sure we received it. I also lost my phone briefly on this holiday and staff at the pool bar and maintenance team were more than helpful with helping me find it. Rooms were very spacious but were not in the best location overlooking the main road but this did not matter as we were never in the…"
 September 2019,1,Mid advertising,I went to this hotel last year and if anything it was the worst hotel stay clear.. the pictures are deceiving not what it looks on the pics. Small pools advertise there is a sauna but not seen one room was out dated and tv did not work. Food was bland and not very appealing never going there again.
 February 2020,5,So far so good 🥰,"Third day here and I’m very impressed. Very good WiFi connectivity, all staff are very friendly and polite and my room has been cleaned daily to a good standard. Hotel is very clean and the beach is situated 2 minutes away from the back of the hotel😊 Good food that caters to all( relieved as my son is a very fussy eater). There is a snack bar by the pool that serves pizza and chips(lovely and fresh). All staff are very friendly, especially the animation team. Really enjoying my stay so far and would return."
 February 2020,3,Good Value for Money,My husband and I stayed at the Allegro Agadir in February 2020 on an all inclusive basis. Overall it is great value for money and the food was quite varied and tasty with a good choice although we were disappointed with the breakfast choices. It would have been better if breakfast finished at 10.30 as opposed to 10am. The indoor restaurant was so depressing and really dark but luckily we managed to sit outside for most meals. The staff are attentive and helpful. Bottles of water are only available at lunch and dinner so bare this in mind if you have got a morning trip out. The hotel had activities by the pool throughout the day which we didnt take part in and it did mean it was quite noisy at times. You can hire beach towels for 200DHM each (around £16) which you get back when…
 February 2020,4,It's a yes from us!,"Can't quite get my head around some of the harsh reviews people have given this place. I am currently sitting on my patio outside this hotel, halfway through our weeks holiday. For what we paid for this holiday, I have nothing but praise for this hotel and all the staff who have been so kind and helpful to my family and I. The food has been fabulous every single day, so many beautiful tagines - meat, fish, vegetables, pulses as well as salads, bread etc.The quality of food they manage to provide on such a large scale has really impressed me. Although our room is perhaps a little dated, everything is spotlessly clean and our beds are comfortable. The grounds are beautifully kept and the atmosphere here is very chilled. I am aware that there is a great deal of renovation work…"
 January 2020,5,"Great hotel, amazing staff","It’s very hard to fault this hotel! My husband along with our 18 month old were visiting for the first time, all inclusive, for a week. We weren’t too happy with the room they’d given us after the first night (no sun when we were sitting on the balcony). However, when we asked if it was possible to move; the manager gave us an option of three other rooms straight away! We were delighted. The rooms are probably a little dated (but for the amount of time spent in them I’m not sure whether this is a huge problem for some?) Rooms are tidied and cleaned everyday (not for us however, as our LO was always napping!!) But that was at our request. The only negative; there was a huge screw just inside the fridge which could’ve done serious injury to out inquisitive toddler so we were…"
 February 2020,1,Not 4* - Disappointing!,"Not 4* at all, would rate it as 2*! Our room was nothing like the advertised pictures! Pictures on ad may have been taken years ago when the hotel was still new! So misleading! Beds are old, tatty single beds joined together to convert to double! See photos! Bathroom very dated, definitely needs complete renovation! See bath tub cracks and broken door photos. Toilet too close to the sink. Bidet should have been placed where the toilet is. Safe is chargeable at MAD25 per day! Unbelievable! See photos. Beach towels deposit is MAD200 each! So have your Dirhams ready. Taxes paid at check-in MAD140 for 2 people, roughly £11-12, for 4 nights! No net curtains in room so make sure you are covered up when dressing/undressing or close the curtains or else, other guests may see your…"
 February 2020,5,Vacation,I regularly visit this place really nothing to complain about. Mohammed the manager and Mehdi are so friendly and will always go out of their way to assist you m will definitely visit again insha'Allah
 February 2020,5,Excellent!,"I visited this hotel back in 2018 and was very happy then so decided to come back this year and this time bring my son due to the place being great. The place has changed in 2 years, definitely for the better(even though I was more than happy last time) the food is much more varied especially for children now. The Bravo entertainment team as ever were amazing!! My little boy absolutely loved Mustapha, Mourad & Karim. He’s still calling them his best friends now and we’ve been home a week haha. Mohammed the manager is lovely as well always says hello! Weather was great as well for January it was 24/25 so perfect with a young child. Really impressed and already planning our next stay with you guys Thank you for a lovely holiday! X"
 February 2020,4,After Christmas break,"Firstly I’d like to thank all animation staff couldn’t do enough to make stay pleasurable. Cannot find fault with bar staff or waiting staff. Food good and varied through out the week well cooked although a little on cool side but a microwave was provided the targines were yummy The hotel is really close to beach without beach prices. My only complaint was the Alcohol There is whisky, Gin, Bacardi and vodka but no Brandy so being a brandy drinker was disappointed but that’s not too bad to only find fault on one Alcoholic drink not being provided it wasn’t a deal breaker. really would book again Thank you for our stay maybe next time (Brandy)"
 January 2020,5,Fantastic Holiday,What an amazing hotel and friendly staff! Food was fantastic and freshly cooked. Will be back again! Thoroughly enjoyed every minute! Special shout out to Karim in Animation! Polite young man! 10/10!!
 January 2020,4,Great break away,"Me and my husband have had a good much needed post Christmas break. Room cleaned daily. Staff were lovely and friendly and the animation team tried to involve everyone. Rooms as previously pointed out are a little tired but the hotel is starting to refurbish. We knew this as read it on the website before we booked so wasn’t upset like some off the quests who say they didn’t know. Night club opens till 2am. Pool bar and snacks available throughout the day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner there was plenty to eat, albeit not to everyone’s taste but always something there. Plenty of drinks (alcohol and non-alcohol) available. Plenty off sunbeds to be found as not too busy. Still get the odd ones putting a towel down before the sun rises yet don’t turn up to the beds till after lunch,…"
 January 2020,5,Best winter sun,Went for a post Christmas break with my partner we wernt expecting much because of the price we paid but we're pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong the place is tired but they are refurbing some rooms much to some guests disgust but it's gotta be done and nows the best time. We were happy with our room again tired but all we did was shower nd sleep what else do you need. The beach and restaurants are fantastic definately recommend El torro spannish best steak ever and we'll priced. Take a trip on the land train takes ya for 45 minutes for 1.60 well worth it. Its been a pleasure we will hopefully see you next year
 January 2020,5,bit late was there in January but,"I am not in the habit of writing reviews but the Allegro in Agadir deserves one. The first and most important factor was the restaurant. The staff were not only extremely friendly and helpful but also delivered 5 star service especially the cheeky Soukaine and Ahmed. A special mention to the Manager Yassin who overlooked the restaurant, nothing was too much trouble when dealing with the guests. His standards were on par with any Michelin restaurant. He never seemed to take a break working from start of day to end of shift at night. For an All Inclusive the food was exceptional, never was one day the same with so much choice especially the Tagines. One night, we were offered prime rib of beef, by far the best beef we have ever eaten. The room was a bit tired but…"
 January 2020,5,Perfect winter break,"We went here for a break from the colin weather & asolutely loved it, the staff are so nice friendly & helpful, the rooms were clean & spacious the hotel is under a revamp & the new rooms are fantastic. We loved the food & the choices to be had the drinks were plentiful which had a good selection. We couldn't have wished for a better start of the year, the animation team were great in particular Adil, Mourrad & Walid they made us feel welcome & gave us a better idea of Morocco in general & made the break special."
 January 2020,5,Lovely Sunshine Break,"Visited Morrocco on 18th Jan 2020 with my daughter who choose the Allegro Hotel. Staff all polite and helpful. Rooms comfortable and beds comfy. Food really excelled my expectations ,lovely fresh veg,meat, fish,salads,pasta,breads, local fare and of course sweets,pastries,cakes. Entertainment very good, the Bravo team work hard and are welcoming and friendly without being too pushy, good set of young talented people, This was my first visit to Morrocco and would definitely return to this hotel as I can't find any fault, superb relaxing comfortable contained place, felt very safe and happy."
 January 2020,5,My favourite Holiday.,"Best holiday ever. We will be coming back again in 2021. I can definitely say the best holiday I've ever had. The staff the facilities I could not fault. Tasty food every day, and lots to choose from. The animation team were wonderful and always eager to help and always there for a chat."
 January 2020,4,Great place to stay,"Now it's been hard for me to decide whether or not to give this hotel a 5star rating. It's close but minor niggles leave it at 4 /5 for me . I will give ratings then an explanation after... Location 5/5 Cleanliness 5/5 Staff 5/5 Entertainment 3/5 Food 4/5 Room 4/5 First off location... very close to the beach and promenade so no complaints there Cleanliness... hotel staff are always buzzing around cleaning . The room was changed every day so again no complaints there. Staff.. very friendly and always trying their best, not all speak good English but that's only to be expected in a mainly French destination. Entertainment... now the staff try but the entertainment hasnt been good at all. Maybe it's because we are here in the quieter season, who knows..but distinctly lacking in…"
 January 2020,5,"Lovely hotel, lovely Staff 😍","I stayed at your hotel for roughly 10 days, and within that time everything was on point. Everyone worked hard and went above to assist and willing to help in anyway possible. Our house keeper Malaka made sure every morning all was well with our room and any concerns/questions asked were answered. At breakfast Souki took care of us at breakfast and lunch, she was very informative with questions we asked about Agadir and places to visit. Security always greeted us, and all staff without fail had a smile on their face and made us feel welcome and comfortable. Bravo entertainment were great and kept us entertained from as little as a joke to theatre. The duty manager Mohammed was always well kept with an approachable manner, a listen ear to any concerns, friendly and made us feel…"
 January 2020,5,"Lovely hotel, well planned pool area",Loved the outdoor dining for all your meals If you like. If anything I would say the pool bar was a little bit od a let down because of the limited snack choice other than that it had a great location nice manicured surroundings
 January 2020,5,Holiday friends,"First time I visited was last year in January 2019. This year we came again in January for 10 days all inclusive. On our arrival We entered the hotel and instantly the manager Mohamed recognised us and greeted us with a big smile, he asked us to leave our bags to one side and go to the restaurant and eat, the rooms will be sorted out for you. This is the way all hotel staff are. They are always willing to help, and have a smile. Most speak atleast 3 languages, English french and Arabic. Both times I visited, i was highly impressed with the entertainment team energetic, keen to get to know you, get you involved. Plenty of activities to get involved I rate the facilities, which were further improved this year by installing pool water heater and aqua classes introduced. I…"
 January 2020,5,Allegro,"A great stay once again at a top facility, brilliantly welcomed by the staff apart from the receptionist Mrs raja miserable and not very helpful. But have to give credit to Mohamed Harkouch a grey guy always helpful smiling asking everything ok, been a pleasure, people like him want people like us to come back and that’s why we come back because of the grey hospitality. Only one down fall no gym in the facility a hotel of such nature must have a gym facility. Thank you allegro and Mohamed Harkouch"
 January 2020,5,Perfection,"Our ages ranged from 10 up to 62 and we all loved our 2 weeks here.The facilities are great,clean rooms,good variety of food and great pools.But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff,from waiters to security they are all wonderful The animationext team in particular really made our holiday.What a great group of people who kept us entertained morning until night.In particular Karim,so funny and always brightened our day!We are already counting down to our next holiday here,hoping to see all the same staff members again."
 January 2020,5,My favorite hotel in Agadir.,"Our sincerely thanks and best wishes to everybody from the staff form the Bulgarian families in room 224 and room 225, January 13-17, 2020. Continue to be perfect in your job to make your guests feeling satisfied like us. See you soon!"
 January 2020,4,Was a nice hotel (visited July 2018),"Overall the holiday was a great holiday. We went as a family and had a great time and was very enjoyable. - The rooms were great we had a family room and it was a good size. We stopped at a garden room with an outside patio and it was situated next to the restaurant. They were very clean and bedding/towels changed all the time. - The food was really nice and they did spicy flavoursome food. There isn’t many options for food which was disappointing. They had a snack bar which was at the side of the pool for the day time. They served chips, pizza, nuggets and sometimes hotdogs. They also did slushes. - The pool area isn’t huge but it’s big enough. When we went it was majorly busy but I think if the hotel was full the poo area wouldn’t be big enough. We never really had…"
 January 2020,5,Excellent,"That was not first stay in this hotel for me. I love the rooms are ready and clean. The staff remember You when u camming back. Beautiful service from the reception. Excellent and the best staff for me is Mohamed harkouch as he is very helpful., patient and informative. I will be back there for sure again and I will recomend."
 January 2020,5,"Great value, fabulous staff","Just returned from a 7 night stay here in mid Jan 2020. This was my third trip to Agadir, and this was as good as my previously much more expensive deals I booked with the hotel direct for the best price possible, having already bagged early bird easyjet flights from Gatwick. Whilst some of the fixtures and fittings are looking a bit tired, everywhere was spotlessly clean at all times. Without fail the wonderful staff are friendly and helpful, from the check in team, maids, bar staff to the great animation team. Visiting in January meant the hotel was quiet but we still got the wonderful sunshine Agadir has year round with pool side temperatures from around 11am until 6pm more than sufficient to relax in swimwear. One of the pools is heated in the winter, so a dip is lovely.…"
 January 2020,5,Lovely Hotel,"I have just come back from Allegro. I did not find any fault anywhere. All the staff from the reception, to the management and to the kitchen all were very helpful. I would highly recommend this place. Thank you to all from me, my mum and daughter."
 January 2020,5,Great Service,Allegro Agadir is a great place to stay. The Manager of Allegro Agadir Mohammed is great guy and very friendly with everyone. Overall all staff was good And I recommend to everyone to stay in Allegro Agadir
 January 2020,4,Photographer of activity team spoiled our holiday,Don't let the guy to take ugly surprise photographs of you. They are really awfull and then they expect that you buy them. So ugly photos make anyone depressed. Perhaps he takes good pictures only of younger women. We had all inclusive and the food was excellent and different each day. Our room was fine and clean. I paid for normal two person room but we got bigger family room. The location of the hotel is excellent.
 January 2020,5,Brilliant,Well we had a fantastic time here our room was lovely in the main building ground floor it was perfect I can't fault it Evan the night club thay have there we meet lots of new friends and we will deffinatly return. Food was lovely hotel was very clean the bed was the most comfortable ever and our room was cleaned to high standards the staff there work so hard thay are amazing LHABIB at the bar outside worked hard to please us all along with the other hard working bar staff and chef at snack bar honestly you have to go it's great can't wait till we return thank you for a fabulous stay oh and I got to ride on the lovely capachino his gorgeous 😁
 November 2019,2,No kettle,Facilities poor for room. Wasnt allowed a kettle was told unavailable. On return to uk told allegro offer bed and breakfast and self catering options. Now cannot answer how supposed to be self catering without any equipment/utensils to cater a meal or a drink. Disgusting service whilst there and since returned. During the week heard many people complain and room cleanliness and conditions
 January 2020,5,Amazing break,"Upon arrival we were greeted quickly and efficiently, paid our tourism tax and were shown to our room. The room was a tad small as it was two adults and a toddler with a pram but no means unmanageable. The room was well laid out, plenty of sockets and mirrors. The bathroom was large and smelt a little but it really didn't bother us. It was a little worn but served its function. The pool area was lovely and clean, fairly sparse in Januay and I imagine Summer it would be overcrowded. They have proper sunbeds too not the cheap bend and break ones! Plenty of parasols. The pool was 'heated' so you could be in it for a little while but it was a bit too cold for comfort. My little boy didn't mind and spent a few hours jumping in. There is a snack bar by the pool serving drinks,…"
 December 2019,1,Never go to this hotel !!,"This hotel was the worst experience I’ve ever had! We always to Morocco every Christmas n’ new year, and have never stayed at this hotel before . It is 100 percent false advertisement as the rooms are not anything like the pictures on the hotel website. The animation team were as friendly as they could be, but could not speak English very well so the communication was difficult. Two nights in a row, the night time Intertainers was unavailable due to them supposably decorating the Xmas tree n’ lobby!! The pool side was very retired and boring, as the children wasn’t allowed to jump in the pool or have any fun. (Our music wasn’t allowed to be played either) The food menus was also the same buffet every night. My personal opinion On the hotel manger is that her doesn’t have much…"
 December 2019,5,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great location - especially for kids","I booked a weeks holiday at this hotel for me and my 2 young daughters 8 and 6 after reading reviews. We arrived on NYE. We were unhappy with our room the 1st night we arrived and asked Reception if we could change room. We were told to come back the next day as many people would be checking out so we did. We were met by the hotel Manager Mohamed Harkouch who was so lovely and showed us to another room which was much better. Mohamed, all the Animation Team, and Staff were all so friendly and welcoming towards me and my children. My kids and a few other kids had scratched their fingers around the circle pool which I reported to Mohamed and the he said he would sort it out. The very next day I saw Mohamed actively check on this. Nothing was too much for him and he was always…"
 December 2019,5,"Top Rate, Everything, Staff so friendly.","We did 10 days over Christmas and just didn't want to leave! Everyone was so friendly with the exception of 1 or 2 trainee bar staff. Rooms are basic but good, spacious and daily cleaning service is very good. Food was quite good, reasonable amount of choice, chips on for kids every days, daily pasta, very good salad range as well as the normal hot choices of meat dishes and vegetables plus the pool snack bar does pizza and chips daily. Pool area was lovely and middle pool heated. Wheelchair slopes were a bit steep to get down to pool and one a tight 'S' brnd a bit scary but one of animation team would always help you up and down them. The Animation team were Brill, working tirelessly to offer activities day and evening, which on the whole were pretty good, they do work hard.…"
 November 2019,1,Saved by the sun!!!!,"This hotel was very poor on every level. The cleaners only arrived at 5.30 pm when we were back in our room after being out for the entire day. Hence our room was only cleaned by them twice in the 2 weeks we stayed. The food was very poor. Often cold, same menu repeated frequently. The 'entertainment' staff were a nightmare. Constantly bothering you and interrupting you. Even coming and sitting down next to you at your table when you were trying to eat your meal!!!! They were a cross between the 'kids from fame' and some strange cult. Seriously !!!!! We had to get away, and found it best on the beach, were we could enjoy the sun and some peace and quiet. However, be warned, as soon as you leave the hotel grounds you are constantly bothered by people asking you for money,…"
 December 2019,5,Back again for Christmas and New Year's Eve at the Allegro!,"As you can tell we love to come to this hotel in Agadir. Last year we tried a stay for Christmas and had a fantastic time, so booked again for 2019. From all the management, reception, bar staff, restaurant, waiters, pool attendants, animation team, cleaners, gardeners, maintenance tour guides and security they are there to ensure you have the best time! The hotel is going through a refurbish upgrade with lots of improvements. Heated pool, spa centre, all rooms to be updated, wifi throughout. All I ask is that your treat everyone like you would wish to be treated (manners go a long way) and I assure you will have a brilliant time here. We are looking forward to our next visit soon."
 November 2019,4,still warm,"at first sight we thought what have we done when the coach was not allowed through the main gate, that turned out to be normal,after leaving the coach and walking to the hotel in the dark we entered the hotel to the bright lights of the interior,booking in was ok but I must have missed the notice of having to pay local taxes at the hotel,going to morocco yearly this must be a new thing.as soon as we were booked in we were directed to the restaurant for a meal even though it was fairly late which was nice,as soon as we were sat down we were asked what to drink beer for me coke light for the wife, no sooner had I filled my smallish glass up another bottle of beer arrived,in the end I had to tell the waiter no more so that we could go to our room to unpack.the next morning I booked…"
 January 2020,5,Ticked all the boxes,"Really excellent wide range of restaurant quality food, never short of sunbeds at the pool, the promenade onto the beach is just across the road from the back entrance. Fast wifi everywhere I tried including the room."
 December 2019,4,Good value,"We booked a last minute bookingwith east jet. it was very reasonable price hotel very tired but manager told us it’s getting a complete refurb and showed us a room that has been done . We had a wonderful time here dispitet this , this staff were so nice friendly and helpful. Great position for walking along beach bars and restaurants not that you need them the food was very good ,limited but every sitting was a different choice. . Once done up it will be great and we are thinking of going again next new year providing they dont put their prices up to much ."
 December 2019,5,Our best Christmas ever,"The Allegro Agadir hotel is a wonderful place. Every single member of staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The room was clean and tidy, and tidied every day. The food was delicious and varied greatly. The entertainment staff had loads of actives for all and made the effort to come round and greet everyone every single day. The hotel had a large variety of excersion available at very good prices, which we enjoyed greatly. I can highly recommend this hotel. In fact I can't recommend it enough xxxx"
 December 2019,3,Value for money,"Positive: staff friendliness, location,chef efforts to prepare food according to our need.night shows were really good.entertainment team was full of enthusiasm. Lack of evening activities.language was a problem sometimes."

The manager mohamed is a great peoples person who always helps out and mixes in well with people by speaking to them and making sure they are happy with their experience... it is very nice to see a manager that walks around the hotel and interacts with people so frequently and comfortably. The rooms are very nice, spacious and modern with lots of room for the family so everyone is comfortable, i was also delighted about the number of mirrors they have in the rooms as it is good for multiple people to get ready in front of a mirror at the same time. The variety of food at the hotel is extremely good as they provide different styles of food that is suitable for everyone. Also the entertainment…"

 December 2019,5,Christmas family holiday,Excellent week’s holiday with husband and adult son and daughter. Lovely hotel in central location. Rooms needed a bit of an update but cleaned every day to a good standard. Food was a high standard at every meal with a large choice for every course. Waiters were very efficient and helpful. One minute walk to a lovely private beach area
 November 2019,5,We love it,"We were there end of November for 2 weeks, our second visit. We had a private transfer from the airport, fast and efficient. On arriving the hotel reception was hectic as the staff were processing guests from 2 planes. The dining room had stayed open to feed us which was much appreciated. Plenty of returning guests which speaks for itself. Mohammed Harkouch, the Duty Manager, seems to have unlimited energy, constantly checking that his staff are doing their best, frequently asking customers if everything is to their liking. The best asset the Allegro could have . Staff in all areas of the hotel are polite, courteous and helpful. Bedrooms, reception and bars, dining areas, pool and gardens, are all kept beautifully clean. The animation team are respectful, not pestering you to…"

Hotel rooms are a good size, very clean and are made up each day. Pool area is large with plenty of sun beds. All inclusive drinks - good variety - wine, beers, spirits, and selected cocktails served until 11.00pm. Food was excellent , A bottle of water was always on the table as standard.

 November 2019,4,Welcome to Africa!,After returning from Jamaica we needed something to look forward to. I had never been to the continent so when we saw a great deal on Agadir I was really looking forward to it. On arrival our room was not ready so after sorting out paperwork we were told we could go to the restaurant and grab lunch. Food was plenty and staff were friendly and made an effort to make us feel welcome. The room was basic and in need of some maintenance work. There was a balcony with chairs and a table but it had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. There was a English speaking movie channel and your regular BBC news station. There were activities around the clock but we had a little trouble figuring out where they were located as activities took place in various places from the theatre to bravo…
 December 2019,4,Winter getaway,"The hotel was walking distance from the beach, literally across the road. In fact, the hotel was situated in an ideal place halfway between the marina and the other end of the beach. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, even with the language barrier at times. The Bravo staff were full of energy, they made guests feel welcome and part of all the activities. I enjoyed watching them intermingle and engage with guests of different age groups, ethnicity, traveling solo or in groups, the Bravo staff interacted with everyone, which was really nice to see. They created a great vibe. There were activities and entertainment morning, noon and late into the evening. There was plenty to do throughout the day and even in the night until 1 am when Brava…"

 December 2019,5,Fantastic Hotel Amazing staff,"We came here for 10 days. We had a small problem with our room at the start. However Mohamed the Manager was excellent and sorted this out immediately. Mohamed is always to be seen in all areas he works very hard even serving drinks when the bar is busy. We enjoyed our stay so much we cancelled our flight home and booked another week in the Allegro. The Entertainment staff are amazing they work so hard and sit down with everyone at meal times or play games with the guest encouraging everyone to join in the activities etc. especially Nares, Youseff, karim. Just to name a few. They even demonstrate Moroccan cooking lessons several times a week. The food is Excellent plenty of choice with Pizza and chips etc all day at the pool bar. The hotel is a 2 minute walk to the beach."
 December 2019,5,"Best holiday i have ever been on, already looking to come back","Rooms were clean and maids came in daily, had hairdryer and tv. There was no fridge as advertised but did not matter to us as we were all inclusive. Nice clean beach across the road from back of hotel, were informed to be wary of those selling excursions on beach. Toilet, changing and shower facilities near pool area and inside hotel. Amazing wifi connectivity. Food catered towards all tastes, got repetitive after a few days but this always happens with all inclusive. Was also a snack bar near pool serving pizza and chips. Servers very polite, management helpful and entertainment team amazing! They made our trip, especially nores ziko and hamza and we are already looking to come back!

 December 2019,4,"Good hotel, great price","The hotel is in a great location, a short walk to the beach, promenade, shops, bars and restaurants. The marine is only small, but a good walk to it. The food was really nice and there was great choice, something for everyone and the tagines were lovely. Good choice of drinks too, soft and alcoholic, the beer was in bottles, and the spirits were good quality too. The rooms were clean and large enough, contained hairdryer, fridge, hangers for clothes, they also supplied us with shampoo, body wash and soap. On arrival we were given a bottle of fizz and fresh fruit in our room. The only let down in the room was the mattress, it was way too soft. Would recommend to visit the hotel and also Agadir."
 December 2019,5,Nice hotel,"The hotel staff are great, helpful, friendly, they would get as many stars as I could give and our special thankies to the duty manager Mohammed Harkouch takes from his personal time to make you feel comfy with everything.

 December 2019,5,Great hotel,"We spent a week here - overlooking the gorgeous beach. We had a tiny problem at first ( no need to mention ) we spoke to the manager Mohammed about it, he sorted it out immediatly, he is always around talking to all the guests with a happy face. The room was a bit old but the view is fantastic. Only 2 elevators in the center of the hotel - a long way from the room. Nice lobby but the rest of the hotel is in need of a makeover. The Piano in the bar along with the animation team during the evening was nice. Restaurant was GOOD - Loved the private section on the beach, the staff were helpful and nice, thank you mohamed for the great holiday and all allegro team , i will def go back to this hotel."
 December 2019,5,Winter getaway,My wife was in a wheelchair and the hotel was spot on with ramps etc the stand out point was the disabled toilet in the swimming pool area I would say to anyone in a wheelchair you Will be fine at this hotel the room we were allocated was brilliant no complaints whatever everything perfect I have never come across a hotel where the staff have been as friendly and cheerful and I mean every single person who works at the hotel and last I have to mention the animation team they were so entertaining it was unreal they all crowded round my wife's wheelchair one night and lifted her up the stairs at the theatre what a great gesture thank you everyone for making our week so enjoyable and all the guests who found time to stop and chat to us when we were at the sunbed area round the…
 December 2019,5,GREAT HOTEL,"Just had a 2 weeks holiday at the Allegro.Great hotel, Rooms spacious clean hairdryer toiletries towels replenished daily.large balcony and cleaned to a high standard daily. Restaurant. excellent variety of food at all meal times {something for all tastes} service also excellent. Plenty of entertainment for everyone. Every member of staff that we met were friendly and would go out of their way to be helpful. {far to many to mention} Good all round hotel for families and couples and for anyone wanting a more laid back holiday, the beach which is only a 5 min walk away,where the hotel have their own private part is great. also keeps the sellers at bay. No negatives about this hotel as the management are very hands on, they do not sit in a office all day. We will be back."
 December 2019,4,Family holiday in the Winter sun,"I was a little worried when I read some of the poor reviews just before we flew to Agadir but I need not have worried as the hotel was fine! We arrived early and went to have a bite for lunch as the rooms were not quite ready, but I had already emailed asking for 3 rooms together and that is exactly what we got. They are a little tired and probably need a coast of paint but they were clean and comfortable and were serviced by the maids every day. (please note all of our rooms had a shower in the bath if you need a walk in shower there are only 3 rooms available) Also the slopes can be a tad steep for wheelchairs and those with mobility issues Its isn't a 5 star hotel and the decor needs a bit of thought but for what you pay its excellent value The food was plentiful, there…"
 December 2019,5,A short four day three night break,"Our stay at this hotel turned out to be better than expected, especially for the price that was paid. The room that we had was spacious and clean. Daily cleaning services. We went all inclusive and was happy with the services provided. Food was good. The excursions that are offered by the hotel are reasonably priced and well organised. We went on two, would highly recommend the camel and horse riding with the bbq, Pool areas clean not over crowded, a short walk of approximately 2 minutes to the private beach. The only downside that I would say was the fact that they do not have a kettle in the room so was unable to make a hot drink whilst in the room. This was mentioned to one of the managers and we were informed that this would be something that they would and…"
 December 2019,5,Good Hotel,"I love the hotel, the food the service especially Mr Mohamed HARKOUCH he solved all our problems, very good manager, we will back again because he promised that the hotel will have some changes; i recommend the hotel, and if you are there Mr Mohammed help you in everything you need"
 November 2019,5,Winter sun,"Rooms very basic but cleaned every day , good and friendly staff at restaurant ,location is very central and beach just across the road . Just beware of when to change for fresh towel ,and the unhelpful towel person NAJWA , just avoid her ."
 November 2019,4,Wyn Purcell,"Had a fantastic holiday hotel was fantastic good food. Staff was amazing nothing was to much trouble. Weather fantastic this time of year, bit chilly at night. Agadir was spotless. Beach's were amazing. Would recommend Agadir for adults, not much for children."
 December 2019,5,Beautiful,"I love this plase the people the food the service,everything beautiful plase wonderful room,everyday different program with the people from Bravo club,and special greetings for the duty manager Mohamed harcouch."
 November 2019,4,Nice holiday with the family.,We stayed at Allegro from 2nd - 9th November. Check-in took 3 hours but thankfully the restaurant was still open so we were sent there to get some food before queuing up. Not a pleasant experience when you've been travelling most of the day and you just want to get in your room and go to bed. The hotel and grounds are kept clean and tidy. The room was a reasonable size and was cleaned daily. It's located just across the road from the beach and bear bars and restaurants. The food was nice and varied. Lots of tagines! The drinks menu was lacking slightly. No Irish Cream or Amaretto. The entertainment staff are lovely. They worked hard and were really friendly. The restaurant and bar staff were friendly too. Sometimes you had to queue up for a while in the Lobby bar but they let…
 October 2019,5,A Wonderful human experience,"In the middle of my stay at the Allegro Agadir, my husband was hospitalized and I was left alone living at the hotel. The employees were so warm, generous and helpful. What could have been traumatizing was turned into a wonderful human experience. I want to thank Mohamed the manager and Mohamed the waiter, Abdullah the barman , Aisha the maid and the security agents. I’d go back there anytime. It’s a beautiful, well run hotel with great food and great service."
 November 2019,4,Had a great hoilday,When I arrived at the allegro I was a bit disapointed with checking in and the room needed updateing.but food was amazing and staff very friendly had a great hoilday and defanley would return .if you go take kettle and a towel..had great time Carol stayed in November .
 December 2019,4,Good in parts,"There is much to recommend this hotel. It is in a prime location close to the beach and the wide promenade. The staff in the hotel were, without exception, welcoming, friendly and very efficient. The food is exceptional with enough variety to suit everyone. Although the building is architecturally fabulous with beautiful surrounding gardens, the rooms have seen better days. If our room was anything to go by, the hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade. The bathroom was scruffy with missing tiles and cracks in the bath. The air conditioning didn’t work, though the beds were comfortable. It would have been nice to have had a hotel information file in the room. But despite the criticisms. We had a good holiday."
 November 2019,4,amazing,first time in Agadir so we really enjoyed nice hotel very good staff specially hotel food really nice lot of variety there is man name Muhammad very helpful beach just cross the road i am going again next year booking same hotel
 December 2019,5,Holiday,"Clean and spacious hotel, great staff and animations team, limited food but otherwise ok, great on site entertainment all day every day, we would recommend for a great family get away. Beach only 2 minute walk from back entrance of the hotel, the only thing you need to learn is to say no to the locals as they hound you."
 November 2019,3,Honest review/ the good and the bad.,"OK reviews were pretty mixed before booking so it was a chance I took. Trying to contact/email hotel is a no no and this is consistant with guests so that's not a great start. Check-in was fairly straightforward and we were taken to our room. Room tired and dated but to be fair it was clean so it was OK. Hotel is a 4* which I strongly dispute unless it's out of 10, more of a 2 *. Animation tream good and tried to get everyone involved but didn't take a no wen you meant no so I got fed up with this. Big shout to Abir as she is the life and soul of the hotel and so friendly and will do very well in the business. The bar staff at both bars were something else, pool bar staff abd rude,did not smile, they appeared to be doing you a favour serviing you so that was a massive …"
 November 2019,5,"Great stay at the Allegro, Agadir","Have just returned from a week relaxing at the Hotel Allegro, Agadir. We were - initially concerned due to some bad reviews but really couldn't fault it. If you want burger and chips then you need to pick a different hotel, although pizza and chips was available from the snack bar if you felt the need. The menu options were varied and included fish, vegetarian and meat dishes, including traditional Moroccan Tangines. The wine flowed freely, special mention to Hassan who looked after us, keeping our drinks topped up. Although check-in was a little chaotic once this was done, we found the staff were very welcoming and friendly, and the entertainment team worked tirelessly to provide entertainment for all of the guests. A useful tip, take lots of coins for tips. They accept…"
 December 2019,5,Holiday sun Nov/Dec 2019,Really good hotel for the price paid...hotel needs updating but this is starting in January 2020...room cleaned and fresh towels daily. Some guests did have problems with their rooms ..staff very helpful and friendly entertainment team try their best to entertain guests ....food is pretty good and varied.....traveled with Love Holidays their hotel rep Imad Mansour from Jumbo Tours was very helpful and efficient...will be returning again
 November 2019,5,Over my expectations,"The hotel is quite large, in a C shape, with the swimming pool in the middle. It has its own restaurant, discoteque, theatre and private beach at the Atlantic Ocean. I stayed in a large room, which was cleaned dayly. Wifi signal was good in any area of the hotel. There is a team of animateurs which involve turists in different types of activities during day and night (ping-pong, volleyball, dance, fitness etc). There are two tennis courts on clay, very well mantained. A snack bar near the swimming pool. Once you paid for your staying, you do not need to spend any penny. I like to experiment local food, so I did it in the restaurant and I liked it. If you expect to find the same food as at home you may be dissapointed. They provide a large variety of food, in a buffet style, but…"
 December 2019,1,Oh hell no!! Disgusting Hotel Alert,"Currently staying at this hotel. Checked in today and am appalled this is classed as a 4 star!! It is currently 1.30am and I’m desperately trying to find another hotel to move to. Yes. It’s that bad. We booked 2 rooms, one for myself and husband and one for my parents to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. We arrived a few hours before them and couldn’t believe the state this hotel was in. Nothing like the pictures, room smells very strongly like wee and the smell of sewage wafts throughout the hotel and grounds. Everything is broken dirty or very very old. And the bathroom is the worst Iv ever seen in a hotel. My parents are both almost 70 and we had to fight for a room with a walk in shower for them rather than a bath they would have to climb in to as we had been…"
 November 2019,4,WOW,"what can we say .... stayed here at the start of November and had a fantastic holiday. rooms are good, food is good , always something that you like and the staff are fantastic .... from the guys working at the pool bar ,the restaurant staff, to the management......special mention to Mohamed who will do anything for you. all you do is ask and it is done instantly. would we go back again ....? Absolutely...... will be going back same time 2020 with my daughter , her husband and three . grandchildren Well done guys , keep up the good work. Roll on 2020 ."
 November 2019,3,Don’t book the excursions,"Hotel. Cheap and cheerful. Rooms are ok, air con works well, clean sheets and towels every day. Strong smell of ammonia for the last few days though. Food. We had a few bad days but overall it was very good. We had a wine waiter for dinner and he was very good. Looked out for us and had a table ready every night. Just a little tip every night was more than worth it and we even gave him a big tip at the end of the holiday because he deserved it. Excursion. Quads and buggies are a must. Well worth the money. Paradise Valley was poor. Looks nothing like the pictures. No water, just rubbish all over. City tour was interesting. Taken to his mates shop to buy some argon oil then to the souk. This is where he left us. He was supposed to pick us up at 1600. We waited until 1630 then…"
 November 2019,3,0 (zero) Star for Room and housekeeping BUT 5 STAR for everything else.,"We just came back from staying a week in this hotel. As the title says, the room quality is just 0. The room quality is definitely not a star quality. Very old room with very small bath room. The tv provided was the smallest size I have ever seen in a hotel and the couch was dirty, torn, the full of marks. You can check the images attached. To make things worse, the door and balcony windows is not sound proof. So, whenever any neighbouring guests open or close their doors there is terrible sounds in the middle of the night which was awful for a light sleeper like me. The shower curtain was missing as well. I ordered a large room with double bed but I got a small room with 2 single beds putting together. I asked in the reception for a newer room with double bed and the guy…"
 November 2019,4,Hotel ALLEGRO,"Bit of a tired feel to the hotel and would benefit from some TLC.Some of the facilities listed in the brochures such as gym and spa don't exist, it still represents good value for money on an all inclusive basis outside the high season.Good location and accessible to shops, bars and the beach.Choice of food exceptional for the money.Some of the hotel reception staff were more friendly and helpful than others."
 November 2019,3,You get what you pay for,It wasnt the best and not the worst holiday i have had. Room was dated could do with an upgrade but was told its due to start the work early next tear. The duty manager mohamed harkouch was very hands on with everything and always asked if everything is ok with a smile and went out if his way to make your holiday better.
 November 2019,5,Amazing family holiday 🥰,"We went as a family on last minute break to get some winter sun and was completely blown away for what we paid!!! From the moment we arrived we was met by this lovely smiley charming manager “Mohamed” who may I add came up to us daily with this huge smile, he was always checking on us that everything was good and that we were enjoying our holiday, he is an outstanding asset to the hotel!!! Keep smiling Mohamed 😁 The hotel was lovely and clean, rooms spacious and catered to our needs. There was so much beautiful food to choose from which was always piping hot with lots of variety. The entertainment was fantastic from in the day to the evening. This was a 10/10 holiday and we will definitely be returning!! We love Agadir 🥰"
 November 2019,1,waste of a holiday break... but great weather,"Hotel was big let down, not as stated We had to return to reception at 12 next day to change rooms, after heated debate we were moved. at least this one didn't over look crappy rubbish filled bin area, smelt slightly better, no broken furniture, shower worked, but was still dirty. The smell of sewerage around this site was dire, worse with air con on, so we left it off. The food was not too bad if you got there early, fresh baked pizza by the pool snack bar was great, drinks were as to be expected on all inclusive, the staff work dam hard at the bars, then theirs the animation team, these youngsters don't get paid, so keep that in mind if you get sick of them hassling you every 5 mins, its like work experience, so they try very very hard...you only get an hour peace and quiet by…"
 September 2019,1,very bad hotel who dosent respond to guests,"26/9/19 we arrived room not as we thought. tried to change room no one would help.wrist bands given, but french and moroccans had a different wrist band, was so that french and moroccans got asked to join in the entertainment leaving the english out. got fleeced in the streets not good place to go, very bad run hotel whom dosent care about their guests. this hotel is not a 4* more like 1 or 2*. I Got ill on the 2nd night no help ill all through holiday. Arrived back at gatwick after 7 days of hell 2 days later still ill. ambulance called hospital food poising.Kidneys damaged and severe dehydration."
 November 2019,3,Winter sun,"We are here now 23/11/19,yes the hotel is dated and needs a few quid spending on it but at the end of the day is clean foods ok and beds very comfy at the end of the day it’s only your base for what we paid not an issue The staff are fab and if Ziko is still about he’s the life and soul of Morrocco"
 September 2019,3,Not 5 star,"We visited this hotel for 10 days in September. On arrival booked in quickly and taken to our room. In our room we had to ask for a fridge for my wife's insulin, which was provided the next day. We asked for the room safe and was told someone would come to get it working the next day by 10am. We finally managed to get into the safe 3 days after arrival after complaining to one of the managers. I must say that the food and drinks at this hotel were good, although it could take a while to get served at the bar sometimes. My main issue with this hotel was the fact that being english seemed to cause some problems. Staff were unhelpful and the animation team did not even try to get us involved in any activities, they were only interested in the French. Would I visit again, no."
 November 2019,4,Relaxing holiday,"I am writing this review whilst sunbathing by the pool. Lots of sunbeds to go round but they could do with a clean. The round pool is heated apparently but I haven't been in. The snack bar is OK but could do with more than one staff to serve drinks. The pizza and chips are good. Spirits include whisky, vodka, bacardi, gin, pastisse, wine. Tea and coffee, beer, and soft drinks too. Not sure how long you would have to wait for a table in the restaurant in the summer as it could get quite busy in November. I wouldn't exactly enthuse about the food but there's enough choice not= to starve. A big bottle of water at lunch and evening meal which you can take away with you. Also wine or beer or soft drinks. I wasn't keen on the bar upstairs. It felt like an airport waiting room. Again,…"
 November 2019,5,The best vacation ever!,"Good location! Excellent great foodd! The Staff off the hotel are very great. They always want the people to enjoye their stay, You are on All inclusive but this is not does it mean you only drink and eat how much you can. There were streching in the morning. After that darts and Petang. You can play ping-pong if you want. There were water zumba as well. Volleyball on the beach. Night entertaiment etc. We were doing lots of things. All the member of the group were always friendly helpfull and dressed up always differently. Absolute make the maximum of their work. Excellent Job!!!!! Well Done!!! :-) Everyone worked for the Guests! You can not ask anything what thes peolple not do for you! If you not believe it go and stay in Allegro Agadir! You will see it!"
 November 2019,5,Taz Sparky,"What an amazing hotel the staff of Allegro hotel truly showed the hospitality of the Moroccan people. I cant complain a single bit about the hotel or the activities or the food. It was my first time visiting this hotel and the first time visiting Morocco. Large variety of food for all background of people, Deserts were lovely and the staff were so friendly always gave a smile, Beds and room were cleaned everyday, nice view from the balcony regardless of which room you are in. I met so many wonderful people in Allegro i just wish the holiday didnt end. I am so sad to have come back to the UK but i know that i will recommend Allegro hotel to all friends and family! Thank you very much for the hospitality you showed us."
 November 2019,5,November allegro agadir,"Had a very enjoyable stay at allegro agadir. Nothing was too much trouble.Entertainment team work really hard to ensure you have a good stay,they involve you in a lot if activities.Mohammed duty manager very helpful"
 November 2019,3,ok but,Transfer went well. Receiption went well.Then it went down hill. The room was down a tiny corridor and it smelt damp and was very small. 4 doors along from the theatre so no peaceful early nights. Told reception but there was no alternative. All meals were buffet style with plenty to choose from. Although not always that hot. The beach was a 10 minute walk away and had no beach bar so no food or drink on the beach. We were not allowed to take food from the restaurant or drinks to the beach. We were all inclusive so would have expected at least to be able to get a drink. Plenty to do during the day. The animation team worked relentlessly and were polite and enthusiastic. The pool was clean and ample sunbeds.
 November 2019,5,Visiting Agadir,We had a wonderful trip. Thanks to the very friendly and professional staff. The service was excellent and the food very tasty and versatile. The price vs quality relation was excellent. We would very gladly return to this hotel.
 November 2019,3,Noisy guests dated rooms,People in hotel were lovely and work very hard.Rooms definitely need refurb. Wasn't happy we had 2 single beds pushed together (not romantic) but room was very clean. Food in restaurant was lovely lots of choices and staff work very hard. Heated pool was brill and private section on beach was lovely and peaceful. The only reason I wouldn't stay here again is because we were next to theater room that was very noisy and guests on one night were fighting. Man on reception didn't show any concern when my husband told him chair on our balcony collapsed and he hurt his back. The location of hotel is very good and all other staff were lovely but we just wanted a quiet break. Will go again but to a quieter hotel.
 November 2019,4,Enjoyable stay at Allegro Agadir,My wife and I stayed here for a week with our 14 month old daughter and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel complex is huge and and the rooms are all spacious. That being said the building has seen better days and some of the rooms are in need of renovation which I understand will happen at some point before summer 2020. For me that was the only area that needed improvement and for which the positive points more than made up for. The beach is a 3 minute walk and is absolutely amazing (would definitely recommend watching the sunsets from there... Magical). The food was absolutely amazing with plenty of variety. The staff were brilliant and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and at home. I would like to thank Mohammad the duty manager in particular for all his help and…
 November 2019,1,If you want quiet dont come here,"Morocco is amazing, lovely people, humbling scenery but this hotel is awful. It is very rare i am so down on something but this place needs to change, there are cheaper nicer places to stay in Agadir. No tea or coffee or kettle in the room, if you want tea from the bar, it comes in paper takeaway cups to take to your room, constant noise from activities at the pool, the ""theatre"" where entertainment noise is off the scale, brits being their best worst, fighting at night and drinking games at the pool with kids around. The allocated beach area was quieter, no euro pop thumping but no drinks or other refreshments, you have to tromp back to the hotel across the road. Dont bother asking for quieter room as reception are extremely unhelpful and unwilling to offer exchange. They didnt…"
 November 2019,3,Good Hotel,A very nice hotel and a good location. Rooms are clean and spacious. The service at the reception is wonderful. Not a large choice of food. Old drunk people are dominating this club. Noisy music can be heard from rooms and suites.
 November 2019,4,Lovely stay,"OK booked this hotel very cheaply then read all the reviews and thought oh well you get what you pay for, but seriously this hotel is very well run and I had a great stay. The rooms: A bit knackered and could do with a good refurb, or a good scrub! we had to change rooms which was organised by the manager Mohammed who was very calm and well coming to everyone, he was always walking around asking you if you were OK he is a really nice manager :) The food: Lovely - there was always something to eat and all very tasty I loved it. All together I had a lovely time - the hotel is central to everything, the beach is a five minute walk away. Would definitely go back as they have now started to renovate the whole complex which I think would be amazing as the only let down was…"
 November 2019,4,Good hotel,Stayed for a week with my family. Had a room problem to start with but it was swiftly sorted out by the manager. It took a couple of hours for them to get us checked in when we arrived which wasn’t too great especially with a baby. The staff are nice bar staff are helpful and polite. The manager is very nice always sorts out any problem you may have. The food was very good. The best thing about the hotel was the heated pool. I’m lead to believe they heat one of the outdoor pools in the winter. Overall a good stay.
 November 2019,4,Had a great stay and will return.,"We were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed our stay here as after reading some of the reviews ahead of our trip I was expecting the worst. Yes the hotel rooms are basic and in need of updating but our beds were comfortable, there was a flat screen tv that had some English channels. The room was clean and we had daily maid service. The food was very good for buffet and there was always a good selection to cater to everyone. The hotel is in a good location and has their own private section on the beach. The staff go above and beyond for you. We had a problem with not having hot water for 2 nights. The first night we thought it was just because everyone was showering about the same time after leaving the pool so didn’t say anything but on the second night we called…"
 November 2019,5,Very well run hotel right where you want it.,"Just returned from a 9 night stay at the Allegro Agadir,this is our 2nd time here and have really enjoyed it both times,Last year as well as this year too we stayed in November,lovely weather,some occasional whispey clouds lurking around from time to time but generally sun tanning weather...a decent 25 +/- 3 degrees c.night time temp around 15 deg’c. On to the room,well,we understand the rooms are undergoing an upgrade but as I have not stayed in one as yet I can only comment on what we stayed in,and yes, whilst basic it remained functional throughout our stay,beds were comfy,hot water ,clean bedding/towels etc,box type tv,hairdryer,couple of sockets,debatable functioning fridge,but hey ho,turned it off and didn’t bother using in. Let’s get on to the food.......Breakfast,for…"
 November 2019,5,Fantastic hotel,"I will be going again to Allegro hotel as we didn't have any problems over the service from the hotel and staff.. Yes the hotel is dated and yes needs updating but the rooms, bedding, towels all clean/changed every other day.. The staff went out of the way to make sure your holiday was great.. I do recommend booking the trips through the reps as we seen two while on our visit and both we're fantastic.. Great choice of trips to go on and very well priced.. The manager was fantastic he help us with the rep to find a dentist for my husband as he woken up with very bad tooth.. Turned out he had a root infection, fantastic help where the rep found the dentist took us too and stayed with us till the end.. He also wouldn't let us pay the taxi's to and from. We paid cash DM money…"
 November 2019,4,Very pleasant hotel,"Nice familyhotel with very friendly staff, good animation and lovely variety in the food. Specially Manager Mr. Mohammed will do everything within his power to make your stay most pleasant, comfortable and safe, most friendly guy ever! Wheelchair accessible except the entrance of the restaurant. Place we would come back to !"
 November 2019,4,Caution,"After a 2 hour wait at the airport for the shuttle bus to leave we eventually arrived at the hotel at 11pm at night. The room we were allocated was not acceptable and we asked to be moved. We had to sleep in the room and we were allocated a better room the following morning. After this glitch everything went smoothly. Beware of con men in the valley of the birds, this was the only time we fell for it. The pictures you see on the hotel adverts are very misleading and don’t show the correct state of the place. Would we go back to this hotel ? It’s due to be refurbished over the next year and Mohammed the manager has promised us better accommodation and service if we return next year."
 November 2019,5,Very welcoming.,"Allegro hotel is the best place to stay in Agadir. All of the staff go out of their way to help and assist you, nothing is too much trouble,they are kind and considerate. The hotel is dated yes, but look past that. Cleanliness is excellent, staff are cleaning from early morning until the last person is in bed and any problems are dealt with immediately . My hairdryer wasn’t working but in 2 minutes I got a brand new one. All areas are spotless. The pools and surrounding areas, including gardens are constantly being attended to. The food is of the very best quality, the choices and variety are good enough, I should think for the most discerning of palates and travelers. There is wine, the red is very good, not tried the white, beer is bottled, very good, and water by the…"
 November 2019,5,Great staff - No French bias,"Before arrival I was concerned about the so called French guest bias. Upon arrival it was clear to see that british guests were being catered for equally. The few physical issues I had with my room were promptly fixed. The food was actually ok, as a fussy eater I still managed to eat something sizable each night. The lobby bar service in the evenings was good, the queue always seemed to move fast however the 11pm close seemed early. I was tipping the bar staff 20dhms every other night and my drinks seemed to be ready before I got to the front of the queue. Look out for Mouad as he was professional but also a funny guy, we always looked forward to him coming round to collect our glasses! If 11pm bar close is too early for you, the small nightclub will be a welcome extension…"
 November 2019,5,Wonderful holiday,"Just got home from a great holiday. Food excellent. Room clean. All the staff so helpful and Mohammed the manager is excellent at his job, very hands on and constantly checking from morning till night that there are no problems. If there are he deals with immediately. Would recommend this hotel."
 November 2019,1,0 START MORE LIKE,"Stay away from this hotel, On Arrival we were given the wrong room and furthermore no access to lifts. The stairs are lengthy which was unacceptable since we have a 10 month old baby. How are we expected to navigate with a pram and we were put at the back of the hotel, which takes 5 min walk to back to reception. When speaking to reception about this, they said there is nothing they can do and abruptly advised I return tomorrow morning. How dare they not even try to help especially when we have a child. My wife voices her concerns to management and oh would you look at that, a room is now available. P.S when checking online the hotel said they had 324 rooms, so why would the staff of Allegro lie????? Cleanliness of hotel room is sickening, dead insects with colony of ants eating…"

 November 2019,5,Great holiday,We arrived to a great reception and lovely people explained our stay. Room was clean. Hotel tidy. Pool area was kept well and the entertainment was very good. Restaurant staff were superb and food was brilliant all week. The duty manager Mohamed harkouch was friendly and made time for us whenever he could. To be honest all staff were brilliant with us. Will be back again
 November 2019,5,Wonderful & Memorable Stay,"Great Hotel and staff. My Family and I enjoyed our stay.. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who want to spend memorable moment in Agadir.. Service, Staff, food, facilities & weather, everything were simply perfect. Special thanks to 2 great managers: Mohamed Harkouch & Yassin Cherif that are making the stay of all guest a real pleasure. You rock it guys and deserve a big applaud.. This is my second time in this hotel and I will not hesitate to come back again. PS: Only thing missing in this hotel is a fitness center.. it will be great to have one."
 November 2019,5,Miss,"The service was amazing the food, hotel and the staff were really helpful and always filled with entertainment. Also the manager Mohamed harkuch was very helpfull and he’s always smiling and willing to help with anything. Overall everyone and everything was amazing me and my friend had a pleasant stay."
 November 2019,5,Lovely location and staff,"Had a lovely time. M Harkouch the manager was lovely. Would come everyday to ask us if everything is okay and if he had any issues he was happy to help. Really friendly, helpful and welcoming. All the other staff, the entertainment team and restaurant staff were lovely. Will definitely return. The internet connection was also good too and even had internet on the beach."
 November 2019,4,Good choice,"Just returned from this hotel. As stated by everyone it’s a little tired in the rooms. Food was very good different themes each day. If you want a quiet holiday maybe not for you, animation team was good but music around pool very loud. Not enough tables outside on a night and long queues for bar on an evening. Small selection of spirits. Having said all that we had a very enjoyable holiday. Staff very friendly food very good and rooms comfortable. Would go back again this time of year as weather was just right. Not too hot"
 November 2019,4,Our holiday,"Well was a little bothered before we went,but had a good time so here we go Sonia assistant manager great helpful lady keeped our room open for a further three hours before we went so we could shower etc,nice happy place food there’s always something so look and ye shall fine. Drinks where great with happy bar staff all the way. Rooms we are clean people so cleaning would not be much effort needed by there cleaners beds where a little stained but soft and comfortable, I do this there should be stickers on all patio doors to show there closed etc found that one out by myself with a sore head!! Quite nice shops over the road and the trips are priced accordingly. Look out for Sonia she will go above and beyond nice lady with a passion for quality. Thanks the the entertainment team…"
 November 2019,2,Not the best,Not the best hotel however its ok if you want somewhere cheap and want to eat out. The reception staff are not very helpful and are very slow. We asked 4 times for shampoo and no one came up with it meaning we had to go down and get it. We had to move rooms 3 times due to them being dirty The burgers they were serving were raw inside - they were also serving them to children The transfer home didnt turn up as it should have done as the receptionist told us the transfer was 3 hours before when infact it was 3 and a half The food was bland and some days there was nothing i liked. They didnt even have baked beans on offer for breakfast Good location quite close to the english bar Best off paying the £100 to go somewhere cleaner and nicer with better food. We had 3 rooms in…
 October 2019,5,HOLIDAY,"My family we spent an amazing time in hotel allegro. We can't complain cos we didn't find anything to complain at. The food was excellent so hats off to the chef for the first time tradition one very tasty and lots of choices for everyone and not the english one... Big thank U to Menager Mohamed who looked after us ,helped and never ignored. Entertainment: I think the BEST ONE we had!Music, games, etc 100% they r goodcwith everyone especially with kids!!! Room was ok but every day clean, towels change so we were happy We had great time 200% we r recommend and definitely we will come bk"
 November 2019,4,Good value for money,"Room was clean and apart from not having a kettle had everything we needed. Really needed a coffee after travelling all day and a check in that took over an hour and the bar closing at 11 so we couldn't get a drink at all, not even water. Bed was so comfy and had a good night's sleep but the curtains could do with sorting as was a big gap which I tried to fix with a clip. Food was good and good choices. Had a few good trips out arranged by the team at the hotel and had a great time"
 November 2019,5,A fantastic stay at allegro,"A lovely, clean hotel. All the staff work extremely hard to make the stay perfect for their guests. In particular Mohammed the line manager who always made time for the guests. He was polite and took time to listen. The hotel is situated right opposite the beach. If you are lucky you can get room with a view of the pool and the sea. The beach is literally a 5 minutes walk from the hotel through the back entrance. There is security at both gates. There is plenty of choice of food. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so special."
 November 2019,5,Family journey,"I spent one week with my family in this hotel . The rooms , food and animation were agreeable . Also , the service was extremely good , especially Mr.Mohamed Harkouch who welcomed and helped us in our journey . So a big thanks to mr.Mohamed Harkouch for his efforts and good reception . I can't wait to come back next holiday inshallah . Ahmed mikhod"
 October 2019,4,Good hotel,Grest hotel with lovely staff Location is excellent Short walk to the beach Food was excellent. Lots of choice at each meal Helpful staff and great Customer Relations Manager and Deputy Manager Hotel was very clean but our room was not as clean
 November 2019,5,Allegro hotel and entertainment team.,"Excellent bravo club team special thanks to Mustapha entertainer for his enthusiasm, professionalism and friendliness. We will return. The hotel rooms were basic and ours didn’t have a shower curtain and broken toilet roll holder but in the great scheme of things hardly a disaster. Beds good, air con, toilet and shower also good. Plenty of working power points and no problem with WiFi. Can’t believe how some people whinge about unimportant faults in a low cost hotel. Food excellent, plenty of choice as were the two bars. Beautiful gardens, pool area clean and plenty of sun beds. Staff the most friendly and helpful people you could possibly wish for. All in all good value for money and would definitely return."
 November 2019,3,Good location,"On arrival it took over an hour to check in and then we got to the room, it was extremely tired looking and the fridge had mould around the seal and inside of the door, the bathroom had white paint splashed everywhere where had painted over the mould on the ceiling , The food got repetitive but was edible but I have to say the animation team were brilliant, they got everyone to join in with the activities and they all work extremely hard, The hotel is in a great location within easy reach of the beach , This hotel is rated a 4 star but in my opinion it is only just a 3 star, needs updating and renovating"
 October 2019,5,Nicely Surprised,"We visited in late October as the hotel was the best value all inclusive we could find in Agadir for some winter sun. After a shocking flight delay and being held up at the Airport, we were greeted by very friendly staff and a drink while we filled in the paperwork for the stay. I was very wary of walking into the room after reading some of the reviews on here but was pleasantly surprised, yes the room was a little dated but the room was clean and tidy and it was definitely worth paying the small extra for a pool/garden view. The food was plentiful and varied with different themes every evening and a good variety for breakfast and lunch with different dishes each day which were always kept topped up. At then end of the day with a resort like this we hardly spent any awake…"
 October 2019,1,Allegro agadir,"I visited agadir late October 2019 and decided to book this hotel after looking through the pictures. The rooms look spacious and modern. When we arrived at our room we was disgusted, the rooms looked nothing like the pictures. We had 3 single beds cramped into a small box room with little room to walk around, the TV was a flat screen on pictures however in the room it was a box tv with no signal, in other words it didn't work. The fridge did not work either. The toilet had poo and stains in it and the bath was dirty, the chrome in the bathroom had not been cleaned for years. The shower curtain would constantly fall down and some of the tiles were broken in bathroom. The toilet moved every time you would sit on it, and would noise throughout the night. The shower pressure was…"
 October 2019,5,Winter Sun - Third visit and will be coming back,"Arrived for our third visit to the hotel, on arrival we were greeted by a friendly porter who took our bags and directed to reception. After filling in the mandatory guest information (we were brought drinks whilst we did this) and paying the local tourist tax we were shown to our room. Yes the rooms are dated (we found out by talking to the management there is a refurbishment programme starting next year) but ours was clean and very comfortable and the maid did a very good job of keeping it clean, she even washed our travel kettle cups every day :-). We noticed some nice changes since last time (Feb 2019) - The hotel is slowly becoming more of an Allegro branded resort, the pool towels (free, but 200DH refunded deposit) were much better than the old blue ones and allow you…"
 October 2019,2,Average : some good bits and some need attention,"We arrived Saturday 26th slightly late due to Easy Jet cancelling our slot once we were on the plane!, On arrival at the hotel we were given our all inclusive bands and despatched to the restaurant before it closed, then returned to complete the paperwork for the stay, then pay a £20 fee that really wasn’t made clear by the reception staff what it was for? Before I go into the negative things, let me say the entertainment staff are excellent and work really hard every day and all day right up everyone goes to bed, plenty to do from pool activities to dry land ones if that is what you want. Good job team! Catering staff and Bar staff also very good with plenty of food and drink through the day. Some better tasting deserts/ cakes would be appreciated as by day 3 they get a bit…"
 October 2019,4,Good Hotel mostly good but some bad points.,"On a late arrival (due to late aircraft departure) we were greeted very well. Initially fitted with our All-Inc wristbands we were whisked off to the restaurant for drinks and food after that we went back to the reception to fill the visa forms and pay the taxes of £22:00 not sure if it was for the room or for 2 people. Our room was 363 not good at all, miles from reception, no view and no rail/coat hangers, slept well but next morning asked to be moved citing my wife needs to hang her dresses! We were well looked after and showed room 224 which was slightly better but far closer to reception/restaurant/pool so decided we'll stay. This room was comfy only the plumbing wasn't good all week we could smell sewage coming from the bidet that I tried to mask with a toilet block and…"
 November 2019,5,Mrs jacob,Very friendly team wide variety of choice of food. Whole entertainment team was fantastic. Loved to be there and we miss it now! Totally a good atmosphere. Loved playing with FATI and ABIR😘 Dancers were great! Even they played two Bollywood dances it was mind blowing👏🏽👏🏽 The staff works so hard with great smile on their face. Amazing. Missed the pool side Zumba! BRAVO. TI AMO💋
 October 2019,5,Fantastic value for noney,"Myself and my husband booked for 1 week . We were enjoying our stay so much we extended to 10 days. This was no problem. We got the same rate and room hassle free at short notice. The hotel is not all bright, shiny and new. But it is cleaned to a high standard, has beautiful gardens,sea views,decent pool, good size bedroom and we were lucky to have a very decent sized terrace to watch the sun go down on from in the evening. This hotel has everything you need for a nice relaxing holiday in the sun- and the people who work there certainly make up for the lack in modern decor or gadgets as they are all super friendly and professional. A massive thank you to Fatima who is a beautiful person inside and out who went out of her way every day to make sure our holiday was going well ,…"
 November 2019,4,Writing this at 00:19am whilst at hotel,"Ok, so I had a sleep this afternoon on the beach, so I am wide awake writing this review, whilst the rest of my family as fast asleep. Ok so firstly, we arrived around 7pm and were checked in by reception... no welcome drink... and very poor English spoken by the reception team. They are very slow and not what I call professional. When I was being given my room key, I had the luck to read that I was allocated a standard room, when in fact I had just paid for a family room. I queried this with the reception team but was told to be optimistic and see my room before making any remarks. I thought fair enough. I should give them the benefit of the doubt. I went to the room, 148 I think it was. The smallest room ever, and if we have 4 beds put in there we wouldn’t have any…"
 October 2019,5,Good Holiday,My husband and I stayed here from the 15th to 29th Oct and were well impressed. From the lovely friendly booking in service to booking out. We were given cocktails on our arrival and shown to our room which had a lovely view of the sea and pools. All the staff were very polite and helpful and some even went the extra mile to make our stay perfect. The food was spot on and very tasty. Everything you can imagine for breakfast is available. Beef chicken and fish dishes were available everyday for lunch and evening meal .There was everything you could think of . I don't think the menus could be improved in anyway. Travellers who are wanting to have English type foods are going to be disappointed as after all it is Morocco with authentic Moroccan food. They have an array of beautiful…
 October 2019,4,"Good location, friendly staff","It was our first time in Agadir and I was a bit worried after reading some of the bad reviews about this hotel. But it was cheap and I thought ""hey, how bad could that be?"". And it wasn't bad at all. We did enjoy our stay (4 adults and 2 children). We've arrived around 11a.m. and were greeted with a drink. Had to wait for the rooms to be ready, so had a walk around and lunch. We've paid 22£ tax/room for a week and took beach towels (with £20 deposit each). The location was perfect, just across the road from the promenade and a huge sandy beach. We've spent most of the time on the beach, the hotel has free sunbeds in the closed area that the sellers don't enter (which was great). The pool area was also good, cleaned daily and not too busy at the end of October. The water was a…"
 October 2019,1,Awful. Avoid at all costs.,"The only way we can describe this place is disappointing. There are many other words I could choose but they are not appropriate. Upon our arrival we went to the front desk to speak to someone about checking in and were ignored. The check in system was strange and we were asked to move from one lane to another for no obvious reason. When we finally received our keys, we were told that someone would show us out room but no such person appeared. We had to find out room (normally this wouldn't be an issue) but we couldn't as it was very poorly sign posted. Our room did not improve our outlook as it was missing many things. We were a group of four and booked two rooms. Neither room had a double bed but instead two singles pushed together. Out of the 7 plug sockets around the…"
 October 2019,5,Allegro hotel Morocco,"We stayed at the allegro, what an amazing place Morocco is so beautiful. We stayed here for a week, the food was amazing, different varieties every day, the snack bar was brilliant for our 10 year old to keep snacking on all through the day. The rooms were a little dated but they are all being upgraded for next year. We did 3 tours if you buy 2 they give you the city tour free, ask your rep as they dont tell you this :) The enetaintment team were the best I've ever seen, they are so happy and helpful and always getting adults and children doing activities. We went on a camel ride, enjoyed the city and will definitely be returning next summer to the same hotel."
 October 2019,4,good location and food,"The location is very good - next to the seaside and the promenade. The variety of food is very wide. Every meal is different. Feeling that for every dinner they have different chief. But in general I didn't like the stay in Agadir, because the hotel is old and need for repair. I felt bad smell from smokers."
 October 2019,4,Super relaxed stay,We had the privalage to stay in Allegro with a super service and a range of food that where super. Although the hotel is a bit dated..but they are upgrading it. We are surely going to visit this hotel in the near future again
 October 2019,5,Amazing,"Can’t fault the hotel, food or service. Friendly helpful staff. Good entertainment. Anyone who has left bad reviews are just fussy. This was my first holiday with my boyfriend and it was perfect. The surrounding area is okay , good restaurants etc, not as dodgey as people make out"
 October 2019,4,First Time To Morocco,"Upon arrival at the hotel it didn't impress us due to the issues we had identified but after 48hrs from arriving and all the issues had kindly been resolved, we had a very enjoyable experience and would consider returning. Food, staff and animation team were great as well as the location of the hotel. Issues were that the rooms are very tired as well as some of the outside / pool areas and the bed mattress was way too soft! The holiday was good value for money."
 October 2019,5,"Great Hotel, great staff",Nice Hotel and professional staff. I loved my room view (pool) and the entertainement was great too. DM Mr. Mohamed harkouch was great to us. Always trying to help and make our stay lovely. For sure will recommend Allegro Hotel and for sur will come back next summer. Thanks Allegro
 October 2019,3,Allegro agadir,"On arrival we were already un optomistic on what were were going to be faced with and to be very frank all our worst fears became real , the first room 156 was dirty ,smelt of damp and waste the porter made a very hasty exit after dropping our luggage , the fridge didn't work and no view apart from a hedge ,it was bleak So we called down to reception who told us to come down ,once there we were told they would move us in the morning at which point I refused to move until something was done that night , I spotted the manager ""Mohamed "" from pics I saw in trip advisor and immediately spoke to him .....he was to say the very least a lovely man who indeed cares about his guests he really does ....it's now 9.40pm and 7 rooms later we finally arrive at room 281 which became our…"
 October 2019,4,Wonderful staff and great location!,"The staff at Allegro have been nothing less than accommodating! Unfortunately, my friend and I experienced the worst possible service at a nearby hotel so we made our way to Allegro upon word of mouth from a friend. They offered us a room straight away, and that too at a very reasonable price! Though we did not require, but all meals were included and full use of the facilities. The bedroom was clean, hotel in general had a high standard of cleanliness. Mohamed Harkouch, duty manager, is always on site to make sure that visitors are happy and pleased with the services on board. We are now left with wonderful memories of Agadir, and it's all down to Allegro! Thank-you so much!"
 October 2019,5,Good all round service.,"Just returned from a 14nights holiday at hotel allegro, my wife and I would like to thank every member of staff for their service from the guard on the door to the manager of the hotel, a special mention to the manager of the restaurant Yassin who dealt with my food allergies personally along with the chef, also a special mention to Soukaina Naomi the waitress who greeted us every day with a smile a mile wide plus a mention to Asma, and the while of the animation team.made a good holiday into a great holiday. Thank you from George and Christine (room146)"
 October 2019,5,Allegro Agadir,"Myself and my hubby had some time away from the kids . We were a little sceptical about the hotel before we came as it had some mixed reviews. Since being here we have had an amazing time , the food is amazing (buffet style) and there is lots of it. Staff are so pleasant and easy to talk to , there was a member of staff that would always come and talk to us as we wait for out drinks , very friendly and always smiling . Will certainly be bringing my children here next year for our family holiday ."
 October 2019,4,holiday,This hotel is well situated for the beach and town. is very popular with the French so gets a lot of children when French schools are on holiday. parts of the hotel are looking a bit tired now but I understand that it is having a full refurbishment soon.overall a good experience.
 October 2019,4,fun in the sun,"overall was a nice break had good weather rooms a bit small, food okay but the staff in and around the complex were great the duty manager Mohamed Harkouch is a great asset to the hotel we would stay here again"
 October 2019,4,Allegro Hotel - Agadir,"All in all really pleased Staff , Service , Food , Drinks , Pool & General cleanliness all excellent. Public areas & gardens all spotless and well maintained at all times. Bedrooms & particularly the bathrooms desperately need refurbishing"
 October 2019,4,Great holiday,"We had read some bad reviews and this hotel is not perfect but we had a fantastic holiday .our first room was not great on stairway and was very noisy but mohamed the manager changed it with no problems and our next room was fine comfortable ,still basic but totally fit for purpose . The hotel is friendly and clean pool area is great and entertainment team were fantastic worked so hard day and night. Food was good plenty to eat with good choice . All staff we found were friendly and pleasant and the location of hotel is perfect . We had a great holiday for not a lot of money .thank you allegro xxxx hotel is simple with good food and atmosphere ,we may return one day ."
 October 2019,3,Our family holiday to agadir morroco,"Having stayed at the hotel allegro in agadir morroco for a week starting 12th October to the 19th October 2019 in room 241. I can honestly say that the rooms a very tired, the drains are very slow to take water away, and the bath had little or no enamel left, the taps were disgusting in very bad need of cleaning, the best are well past there best and require new mattresses the rooms are cleaned every day and new towels placed in every day but I really think the cleaners could be doing with some basic cleaning skills. On the positive side the pool area sells the hotel the pool area and gardens are well kept with plenty of loungers, the restaurant food is OK not brilliant 90% of the food is morracan and to be expected to be morrocan however there is only so many times you can eat…"
 October 2019,5,October Get-away!,"Excellent value for money - had an amazing week in the Allegro Hotel. Without exception, all staff are a credit to the hotel with a special mention to the manager - Mohammed. Although the room was basic, it was equipped with the necessities to have an enjoyable weeks stay. Food was good & plentiful and service effortless. As an ‘all-inclusive’ guest, we were never thirsty or hungry. Hotel is nicely located to all Agadir has to offer. Highly recommended"
 October 2019,4,Fine for an all inclusive,"Having read some of the reviews I was hesitant about our stay, although I also try to take reviews with a pinch of salt, especially when it is so mixed. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the hotel is a bit dated, especially the bedrooms but then I wasn't expecting anything boujee. I'll address some of the most common concerns: Food - It was standard all-inclusive, nothing spectacular, nothing horrendous. Decent opening times for each of the meals - especially when we got back at 9:15pm from a day trip and could still get dinner! I would say a bit more labelling is needed, its inconsistent with some having labels and others not, especially around the salads and desserts. One lunch I managed to put a seafood salad on my plate, the seafood wasn't visible at the top of the…"
 October 2019,5,No regrets!!! A beautiful hotel with lovely staff.,"Wow, what can I say...From the minute you step inside, you are met with smiles and laughter. The staff (from reception to cleaners, gardeners, waiters, waitresses, cooks, managers, excursion organisers, bar staff, Club Bravo staff) were all great. The food was amazing and there was always something tasty to eat (even my non-meat eating daughter loved the food). The grounds were absolutely immaculate and a please to walk through each day. My only slightly negative point was that the WiFi was awful (unless in the reception area or restaurant). Our room was in the adjoining building so that may have been the reason. But to be fair it was manageable. Also the curtains at the balcony door need a little attention as they did not pull together, so I had to use the old hanger trick and…"
 September 2019,5,Amazing,"I know that there would be a lot of better looking place, but stuff, and restaurant - just amazing! They do best job i ever saw in simillar places! And the manager Mohamed Harkouch - best man ever! Really face of that hotel! He made atmosphere in Allegro Agadir to feel like home!"
 October 2019,4,well worth a visit - honest review,"on arrival at the hotel (aprox 9pm) we we greeted by smiles and laughter at reception they took our cases and showed us to the restaurant. the food was lovely the waiting staff were all pleasant, after eating we returned to reception to check in. at this point it was mad busy and a little hectic, we were asked to complete the visa form, pay local tax and then queue to check in which all went seamlessly. we were allocated room 255 a concierge man assisted with our cases to our room. on arrival at our room we found it to be old and in need of a refurb (this is happening at end of oct for the whole hotel) the fridge didn’t work (requested a fix but didn’t happen realised with all inclusive didn’t need it anyway) but seemed clean enough all be it everything was old so only so much…"
 October 2019,5,The warmest welcome to a wonderfully interesting country.,"From the point that we were picked up at the airport, the people that we met were keen to make sure we had a good time. They were pleased to be able to share information about their country and history. The hotel dealt with an early glitch with huge courtesy and warmth. All of the staff were welcoming, friendly and good fun. The food was as good as it gets with an array and choice I'd defy anyone not to be able to find something to savour. All freshly prepared, sometimes cooked as you wait, wonderful variety and way too many delicious deserts for those wishing not to be tempted!! I could not find fault with this hotel nor the attitude and service provided by it's staff. People on the trips we took were also hugely friendly, although I would strongly advise learning how to…"
 October 2019,5,Wonderful,"This holiday was absolutely fantastic. I am with my twin sister for a week away for 40th birthday. The hotel is central and everyone is incredibly helpful. The duty manager, Mohamed really can't do enough for you. He fixed an issue in our room immediately and let us look round other rooms as my sister and I are so impressed we are bringing the children back next year. The only slight niggle is you have to go to a bar/ restaurant for a brew! Coffee machines dotted around the complex, or facilities in the room would be most welcome. Everyone works really hard here. Look, I'm coming back with the kids! How bad can it have been 😁"
 October 2019,3,OK,"A little disappointing but I will start with the positives. The hotel is nice and close to the beach and shops. The staff were very attentive and friendly most of the time, especially the Animation team who were always upbeat and friendly, trying to get all Involved in activities. The pool snack and bar staff too, work tirelessly all day, much credit to them, always a variety of drinks and snacks available. The pool area is clean and plenty of sunbeds. The hotel itself is nice and the surrounding gardens are picturesque. The restaurant is OK and plenty to eat, good variety at all meal times. However if you arrive late in the evening for dinner the staff are not so keen to help you find a table, we were a party of 8 and naturally wanted to sit together, one evening the…"
 October 2019,4,Friendly Staff and Decent hotel,"Visited in October, 2 double rooms on level 3, which is the reception ground. The staff were very helpful and friendly always smiling. The room was a decent size with a huge double balcony for the two rooms. Housekeeping was spot on daily. Beds were very comfortable. Plenty of power outlets. Bath and shower combination. Pool and sea view. The food was good we didn't have any stomach problems at all. Decent variety of foods but needed more hot meats. Nice pool area with snack bar. Wifi was very good mostly even in the rooms. Had a problem with the door lock a few times which the staff dealt with swiftly. Would definitely recommend and stay here again."
 October 2019,4,Rooms need updating,Good hotel for families . Staff always available and cooperative. Could do with certain things updated. Bar area rather small for the amount of people. Waiting time to get drinks. Good value for the money .
 October 2019,4,"Had a great time, tired rooms though","Stayed first week in October 2019. Told there was a meeting at 6pm that was very important to attend but we never did, turns out it was basically trying to sell tours etc. First impression on the rooms were that they were tired. We had 2 singles beds ( married couple ) pushed together despite asking for double bed. Matresses were a bit soft in the middle. TV only had 2 english channels, one was BBC news 24 and the other a movie channel, but lots more in french or german. Bath had a crack in it and looked dirty, we tried to clean it but realised it was just old and stained. Double sliding door needed attention as was a pain to close and lock. Food was ok, had som themed nights when there, the BBQ night being the best. Couple of times we didnt fancy anything they had on offer…"
 September 2019,3,"Fantastic staff,fantastic pool and good,but we changed our room as was dirty and crawling with ants,Also got locked in,","As above ,rooms not very clean ,broken tiles,crawling with ants,bedding smelt of cats wee,just felt dirty,staff amazing,very helpful and polite,food fab,pool and other areas very clean,just our room and my daughters room shoddy,"
 September 2019,5,Wonderful holiday!!,"At the end of September, I've been lucky enough to visit one of the dream countries - Morocco. My resort town of choice was Agadir, because I wanted to see the ocean. The weather turned out to be quite unusual: for the first 5 days the town was foggy and hazy, the temperature was all right, there was no heat, the evenings were even rather cool. In the remaining 5 days, the sky became clearer, the sun came out, and we even had a chance to get some tan. The heat felt real, when we were out in the sun. Before the trip I had some concerns about the differences in mentality, but those concerns and prejudice vanished as quickly as the fog over Agadir. Of all the hotels, we chose the oldest in the city and the most reliable, judging by the reviews: AllegroAgadir. We were really…"
 October 2019,5,Lovely hotel,"I just came back from this hotel yesterday with My family. We all had a lovely time, everything was excellent the service was great the waiters were very friendly especially soukaina naimi. She was very polite always smiling and made us feel very welcomed. We definetely want to come back because of staff like that. Abdul"
 September 2019,5,Very good place,Friendly service welcoming us every day with a smile. Delicious and varied food. Restaurant service is very helpful. Very interesting animation classes that last all day and night. All this allowed us to spend a wonderful vacation!
 September 2019,5,Wonderful place,"Allegro Agadir hotel is a friendly place for everyone. Food- very delicious, various, fresh fishes and fruits every day. Restaurant service excellent. Staff- helpful and positive. They will help you in every problem or answer any question that you have. They also have a great contact with every visitors. Moroccan oriental dinners and shows of oriental dances are great option for tourists to know better the culture and climat of Morocco. I will definitely go back to this place becouse of great, friendly atmosphere, delicious food, great location and very comfortable beds."
 October 2019,4,Allegro,Really pleased with our stay overall. Only issue was a very rude lady on reception. Good value for money. Made good friends there. Most staff were lovely. Nice food & beach great & very close. Recommended here
 August 2019,5,Holiday of a lifetime,My favourite holiday i have ever been on. The bravo club are the friendliest people i have ever met and many of them have now become some of my friends. They speak a variety of different languages and never leave anyone out.Even now i still talk to the animation team on instagram and snapchat (2-3 months after i stayed) It was such a pleasure to be welcomed by everyone.
 October 2019,5,Amazing!,"Stayed for 7nights. We are so happy we decided for this hotel. Hotel was very nice and clean. Our room was spacious, very comfy mattress, love the the big pillows and duvet! Bathroom clean and fresh, provided shampoo/conditioner/soap/shower gel :). Water pressure was also great! All the rooms are with balcony, we had a view to the main road( no noise). There was also TV in the room, safe for little charge and the fridge. The resort itself is huge. Reception and bar on 3rd floor, restaurant, swimming pool and snack bar on ground floor. You can not get bored in this hotel. Many activities to do such as pingpong, darts, pétanque, etc. Great entertainment. All the staff is really attentive, happy to help, they work really hard but always with smile. They make sure you enjoy the…"

At last ,i thank Alegro for this opportunities ."
 September 2019,3,Not bad,"Had 7 days at Allegro, last minute deal so was good value for money. Our room (176) was very tired looking, bathroom desperate for a refurb, but it was clean. Restaurant was good, varied food, excellent service especially from Simohammed, such a hard working young man with a constant smile. The bar staff were not so good don't think I got a single smile all week! To be fair it is very small bar for the amount of customers, always long queues to get a drink, so the bar staff had to work hard. The entertainment crew were very good but mostly spoke French. We a couple of trips with the man selling just outside the back entrance, really good, no problems and reasonably priced but I forget the name, his board is right by the zebra crossing heading to the beach. The beach is lovely,…"
 October 2019,4,Enjoying our stay,"We are staying in Allegro Agadir hotel 5 days and having a very good time.the swimming pool is amazing and the rooms are not bad. We are lucky with the weather , it is sunny but not too hot. The food is nice and diverse, and it was delicious on Friday night. The staff is friendly and ready to assist. Special thanks to Fatima who gave a lot of her time to help us to accommodate and fix our schedule. She is great and a good professional and a charming person ! We are also grateful to our waitress Saukina, who has good communicative skills and did her best to make us enjoy our meals. However, the WIFI access was far from perfect and it sometimes it took time to connect. Also, we would prefer to have a mini disco and special entertainment for the kids who lacked it and had to join…"
 September 2019,5,Another Amazing Hotel Allegro Agadir Adventure!!,"This was our 7th(+??) time at this hotel (we wouldn't keep coming back if it was no good!). Improvements are being made such as Wi-Fi in rooms but as this is a all year round hotel things can take a bit of time, We were there for my husband's birthday where they decorated our table at lunch and dinner. Even coming out with a cake delivered by the management, waiters and annimation team singing happy birthday!! The hotel has all your comforts - traditional shop, henna artist, piano player in the evening in the bar, trips & excursions from Bravo Tours or Fouad at Jumbo Tours. The Bravo Animation Team throughout the day and evening (always something for everyone!) Always smiling and genuinely happy to be with you, they never seem to stop. Bar staff are another group who don't…"
 October 2019,5,7 day getaway,Fouad from Jumbo excellent rep. We had a very good break. Fouad assisted us to tailor our short break. Very good trips espacially the massage. Must have at start of holiday. Very friendly people ib hotel. Amazing fast service in restaurant
 September 2019,5,Love it,"The stay at allegro was enjoyable, relaxing and inviting, it is well situated next to the beach , nice food lovely pool and clean rooms excellent staff very kind and friendly, big thumbs up to fatima she’s lovely definitely coming back"
 September 2019,4,Impressed,Firstly this isn't a 4star hotel. But what it is incredible value for money. Our room 63 needs updating but it was ok. The bathroom needs a refurbishment. The food was very good. The drinks good. The staff are busy but always effecient. Yes there are Hotels within the resort that are no doubt better but that comes at a cost. Ignore the reviews who give this hotel press. I'm picky I work in the industry and I'd happily return if the world wasn't such a big place.
 September 2019,2,Oh dear,"Hotel is a 2 star no way is it 4 .Entertainment garbage same crappy music everyday on a loop ,awful .Snack bar crap same every day pizza and chips pizza was bland.Was ill on 2nd day probably food poisoning, I wasn’t the only one quite a few people sick the week we were there. Don’t eat the food unless you want to spend the week on the bog like my partner and I .Food was absolute crap My partner asked for water they said we had to wait for lobby bar to open this was at 10 am opens at 11 needed water so I didn’t dehydrate.Never again will I visit this flea pit was happy to get home"
 May 2019,5,love this place,"Wow, Im so shocked about the amount of bad reviews I have seen on here about this hotel!! I visit Agadir 2-3 times a year,for past 3 years and always stay here! Why? Because its clean, stuff is brilliant, they cant do enough for you!! Especially Mohamed!! He always have looked after me,my friends,family, this person here goes out of his way to provide the best experience You could have in Agadir! thank you so much for that darling! Food choice is good, never ever had any issues with it! Even my fussy 3 year old always have had something to eat! My 2 daughters absolutely love this place! I love it there! Its so peaceful, the wibe is just sooo nice! Bravo team always comes to talk to you, they speak in different languages, not just French so im not sure why these accusations…"
 September 2019,5,Verry good holliday,"I loved hotel allegro so mutch, it is verry good place to relax. The service of the restaurant and coffee and also disco tantan is verry good ,, iwant thank specially mohamed harkouch for the service given by him to me , he is realy competent in his work and he is so nice and jovial with tourists. he has encouraged me to coming again"
 September 2019,3,So far ... ok,"The hotel is very clean. The staff work hard to keep it that way but it is in dire need of a facelift. The rooms are ok but no tea/coffee making facilities. 4*?? Maybe not. Drinks can only be got from 2 bars during the day and 1 in the evening. You're lucky if you don't have to queue ... and I mean queue! Usually only 1 man behind the bar while others are standing around having a chat. And they have no sense of humour!The managers wander around asking if everyone is good but no help to anyone really, a trained monkey can do that! Maybe I've been here too long and gotten fed up with it. Holiday ends in 2 days. Will be glad to get home. The only bright spark is the service that we got in the restaurant. Simohammed is excellent. His Customer Service skills are a shining light…"
 September 2019,5,amazing,stopped at allegro for two weeks in september.it was faultless food was excellent. rooms were spotless. entertainment team were great. morroco was the best holiday we have ever had. but stopping at the allegro made it even better. from the time we arrived the staff and management worked tirelessly at making our holiday great. will definitely be going back to this hotel. thank you allegro.

 August 2019,5,Holiday,"Very friendly and kind staff, perfect hotel and also helpful and kind manager Mohamed. The food was very good and all was perfect. Rooms are nice and clear. I recommended it to everyone who want to relax and spent pleasing time in nice surroundings."
 June 2019,5,3rd time at this hotel,After reading some of the reviews on here I thought I'd leave my review. I've stayed in this hotel 3 times now. My last visit was in May-June I have never had a problem with staff being rude or feeling left out due to there being a lot of french people. I can understand why the English would say they feel treated differently but I think it's just a case of being able to understand the french better given it being the second language spoken in the country. Staff - Mohamed will go out of his way to help anyone that has a problem we managed to lock 2 room cards in our room the first night and he got us another one straight away. He's always about listening to anyone that needs help or has a problem with their rooms. Food - In terms of food there is a section in the restaurant…
 September 2019,2,Not a 4 star,This is a hotel for the French NOT English. This hotel is not a 4☆ hotel. I have travelled alot and would say 2-3 star On arrival we was showen to our room all look ok. Then the bed side light didnt work there was no fridge in the room. We was on the ground floor room 66 people was just walking passed the window. No privacy the room was very dated and run down nothing like the picture The following day we was moved to a better room still fridges didnt work but room felt a lot cleaner. Pool was lovely just needed the floor to be clean i went in pool me feet was black. The food wasnt good at all we eaten a few time out like kfc and we went to the English over the road for a b/fast. Be careful using the English bar we went over with a couple we had met and was offered drugs on…
 September 2019,1,AVOID!! WOULD NOT RETURN IF I WAS PAID TO!,"On arrival, we did not have a room for 3 hours as the staff had not finished “cleaning” them yet. And was made to hang around and wait with no welcome drinks or food, ever for the children. Eventually, we received a room key where we was met with 3 single beds for a family of 4?? When questioning the staff about this we was told there is nothing they can do and it’s not their problem. A friend dragged a bed out of their room and placed it in ours. This still did not work as we could not place our suitcases and pushchair in the room. We went back to reception to tell them it’s not acceptable where to the staff became rude and aggressive which Upset my 3 and 6 year old. The managers are nasty and do not want to help you. We was told that no family rooms are available for us (after…"
 September 2019,1,Lamentable,"Following the Thomas Cook debacle and subsequent cancellation of our holiday to Marmaris, The young lady in the Tui shop suggested Agadir and specifically the Allegro Hotel. Upon arrival I had that sinking feeling as the mini bus meandered past the tired signage, dust driveway and humdrum exterior. The check in staff were reasonably polite. After we were shown to our room the full gravity of my decision became apparent. To call the room tired would be a compliment. I'd forget about the four stars and suggest the room is hostel standard. The food fair is stew in the morning, stew at night and stew in the afternoon,alright. The Brits are catered for with lank french fries. The food & crockery isn't covered and is an adventure playground for flies. Other hotels I have stayed…"
 September 2019,2,Not for the English,Avoid if British Booked this hotel was not expensive but wasn’t expecting a 5* but at least a nice holiday. Check in was a farce took forever and not very welcoming I had read reviews about this. We arrived late no welcome drink nothing! However watching the French check in they all got drinks and was treated very well this angered me... However after we went out we did have a plate of food and a bottle of water waiting in the room this was a nice touch! The room Dated and not the best we did not ask to move however every other English couple did and rightly so after hearing some of the horror story’s. we was at the back of the hotel it was quiet so made the most of it. The pool area The pools were lovely however around the pool area was NEVER cleaned! I had chewing…
 September 2019,2,Not the best,"So on arrival, got to the reception area and had to queue for the longest time and it was completely chaos to check in. Never experienced anything like it. Anyway, taken to our room. Tiles hanging off the walls, cockroaches in the bathroom and a view of a graffiti wall. Fantastic. After a few days a toxic chemical smell was surrounding our room. We thought it may have been the air conditioning leaking. Rang the receptionist, may I add, the lady who dealt with the money on the reception, RUDE. Attitude. Horrible..... receptionist told us that the room needed a clean and said there was no smell... a man turned up and sprayed fabric conditioner into the air conditioner unit... so they clearly knew there was something wrong with it in that room. Within two hours the smell was…"
 September 2019,1,Honest Review!!,"Firstly I have been to Agadir many times both 5* & 4*, this has got to be the worst! Arrived to our room which looked on to graffitied walls, the TV was older than me 🤷🏽‍♀️ The bath was orange! Food was always cold and the same, entertainment team, waiters and bar staff favoured the french we barely got asked what drink we would like, never got shown to our table. Our last night here was ruined by the lobby bar waiter who was very rude to myself and when I asked why he was rude he pointed his finger in my face and said I was rude, then I got served by his colleague but yet again came back to shout in my face again with his finger, this ended with me speaking to a mananger who was apologetic but after myself working within the travel industry nobody should be spoken to like…"
 September 2019,1,AVOID AVOID IF YOUR BRITISH!!,"This is a genuine and honest review. Just got back from staying in this hotel, we went with friends. Arrived at hotel around 12.30 checkin is 3pm, husband explained that I have limited walking ability so needed a room close too the main part of the hotel. Eventually after waiting 4 hours got allocated a room to find it was furthest away from main part up steps round corners long corridors etc, room was very small and had a view of graffiti and main road, complained about this room finally got a different room after 7.30 pm, after complaining to Mohammed,2nd room needed upgrading very tired looking bath was well I'll let you see the pictures. Entertainment staff were only bothered with the French that were staying there & hardly spoke too any Brits, senior managers were the same…"
 September 2019,1,silver wedding treat ruined,"We had stayed at this hotel about 15 years ago when it was a nice 4 star hotel we booked this for our silver wedding and it ruined it food awefull, staff ignorant,. beer out of bottles so if you went to get one it could of been stood there for ages. rooms need a make over they are tired ."
 September 2019,1,Terrible,"After visiting this hotel 2 years ago and having a fantastic time we decided to go back and take friends. Worst decision we ever made after waiting 3 hours to check in (this is after 3pm) our rooms faced a patch of dirt and a wall covered in graffiti. They kindly moved us to a better room. The hotel is geared up for the French guests 80% of the animation team spoke in French including all the games around the pool. Food was very repetitive but luckily there are decent restaurants in area. Evening internment was french karaoke by the pool, family fun around the pool wasn't aloud ( jumping into the pool) they were not interested in entertaining young children confusing on who is the managers of Mohammed tells you he's the manager he is not they promise one thing and then another…"
 September 2019,4,Basic but don’t be scared by reviews!! Definitely worth the price!,"I’ve just got a back from a week all inclusive here and for the money it was great. Room is very basic- fridge didn’t work, tv looks like it’s from the 90s and bathroom door didn’t close properly. Tried to report the fridge 3 times before giving up but at that point we knew we could live without! Pool is great we never struggled for a sun lounger, food was great we couldn’t believe how nice it was for the price. Only thing I would advise people on is the weather! We probably had around 2-3 sunny days whilst we were here, the Agadir mist which I only found out about on my first day definitely was apparent and it was very cloudy most days! Wouldn’t recommend if you are a sun-seeker. This was our first time to Agadir though and we was told that it was quite unusual for the cloud…"
 September 2019,1,Avoid at all costs if you're British!!,"Agadir is a beautiful place and would certainly come back. As for the Allegro, I wouldnt wish it on my enemies! As a British tourist, in this hotel you are treated as a 2nd class citizen! All the hotel staff with the exception of a few are rude, arrogant and not customer focused at all, unless you're French!! The rooms are old, worn and need a lick of paint. The pool area is far too small for the size of the hotel and the restaurant and food is diabolical to say the least. Food is very bland and repetitive, by far the worst all inclusive hotel food I have ever had, or tried, spent more time eating out to avoid it if I'm being completely honest! The room was never cleaned properly, we had to complain to get the towels changed in the bathroom a few times, just distinct lack of…"
 September 2019,5,Amazing holiday at Allegro ❤️,"It was my first time in Morocco but certainly not the least. It’s such a amazing country with pleasant and helpfull people. The hotel Allegro is very nice and comfortable for guests. There is a lot of green area and flowers. It’s located close to the shops, wonderful and clean beach with private sunbeds. In my opinion the hotel should be renovated little bit but it isn’t big problem. Rooms are clean and neat and this is the most important for me. Linen and towels are changed daily. The best thing in hotel is definitely food. It’s absolutely amazing and tasty. You can find there typicial Moroccan cusine but also Spanish, Italian and others. There is huge selection so everybody will find something for himself. And the second best thing about Allegro is staff. All workers…"
 September 2019,4,Good budget hotel,"Stopped here for 2 weeks early September. Is it the best hotel I’ve ever stopped in no, is it the worst nowhere near it! There are things that could easily be improved and cheaply enough... worst issues we found were for 3 days we had to complain about having no towels put in our room despite our others having been taken this was eventually sorted and we had some towels each day but shouldn’t have to put up with it. Secondly it’s down to housekeepers again the cleaning in the rooms is particularly poor, when we arrived a razor protector was on the floor in the bathroom at the corner of the bath it was still there when we left... also on the balcony were some smoked roll up ends and again they remained there throughout the 2 weeks and were still there when we left, despite…"
 September 2019,4,Agadir Trip in Hotel Allegro,"One of the best hotel as 4 star in agadir. Staff and manager Mohammed were so friendly, polite and helpful. If you have short budget I would recommend you to stay in this hotel. Shopping centre and market very near by. I really enjoyed"
 March 2019,5,Early Summer break for 8 people,"We arrive late in the evening as flight delayed did not expect any food as of the time factor but we were given a packed meal in the room very good of the staff.Rooms are big with terrace or balcony and en suite with nice views of the well kept gardens,The food in this hotel is fantastic we had 8 people to please and they all said it was very fresh and interesting the floor manager was on the ball and staff very helpful .Most of our company have been many places and different hotels and for what you pay this is by far the best value. the staff work so hard all day keep fit and games ect.The private beach is only a short walk away and very clean there are plenty of off site restaurants ect if you fancy a change of scenery fantastic all inclusive hotel so good we are all going…"
 September 2019,4,Great holidays at great place!!!,"We went for family holidays, as we arrived late we were wondering if we will be able to get any food, but as soon as we came in, we’ve been send to restaurant were hot dinner was waiting for us. We had a little issue with room cleanliness, but it has been sorted out very quick. All areas are very clean, good selection of food and drinks, beautiful, well maintained garden, great pool, plenty of loungers, just 5 minutes away from the beach with private sector. Entertaining team fabulous with great programs. Everyone at hotel were so nice and friendly, anything you need you could ask and they are there for you. I need to mention two names 1st is Fatima the best guests relation experience person I ever met, nothing was to much for her 😘. The 2nd one is Fouad who goes extra miles to…"

 September 2019,4,good value for money with excellent animation team and staff,"stayed 7 nights here,booked budget room got room 147,had everything we needed if a little tired,only downside was as theatre ends about 11pm everyone going past your room so noisy for about 10 mins.had modern tv with a few english channels,air-con was not cold enough for my liking,i reported it but was the same all week.plenty of hot water and fresh towels every day,only downside if you want to rent a safe it is an offsite company and you have to wait in your room at 6pm to get it activated.The public ares of the hotel are kept clean as is the pool.plenty of loungers never a problem to get one.food was great plenty of choice in restaurant and snack bar by pool from 10am to 5pm.Bar selection was good and staff were fabulous always smiling.The animation team do a great job…"

 August 2019,5,Fantastic,"We came to allegro for 10 days as a family of 4 - myself, my husband, my mum and my 8year old daughter. We had such a brilliant time. There was a few issues from the start with the room that we had been given but it was soon resolved. The issue was the balcony door wouldn’t lock in our room and the fridge didn’t work. The only other problem we had was - being in the annexe Part of the hotel the water pressure on the shower is very poor at certain times of the day.. My daughter had her birthday here and in her words ‘it was the best birthday ever!’ The bar staff and restaurant staff were all really lovely and upon request arranged a birthday cake for my daughter at lunch time and even sung happy birthday to her. The entertainment staff were amazing! They made the holiday the…"
 September 2019,4,Don’t be put off by the reviews,"We booked this holiday for 8 people ranging from ages 65 to 15. Having read the reviews I was really worried and thought it was going to be a disaster, but I was pleasantly surprised. Right I’m going to get straight to it Rooms ... ok so they’re old and tired and look dirty, however I can assure you that I went round with anti bacterial wipes and cleaned all the surfaces no dirt what so ever on the wipe they’re all just very old and need some serious tlc.. tbh I feel the rooms needs a serious renovation. The beds are ok not brilliant but manageable. We booked three rooms and fridges in all three rooms weren’t working, however a very kind gentlemen tried fixing it and when he couldn’t he arranged for a new fridge. Light wasn’t working in one room again very prompt got it…"
 September 2019,5,The best hotel in agadir,"Second time I've been here. Top hotel and very funny and helpful staff and the food is amazing.The rooms are clean and are cleaned daily.2 swimming pools,3 bars and private section right on the beach.Will definitely come again."
 September 2019,4,Very animated hotel,"It's a very nice hotel in the heart of Agadir. Agadir itself doesn't have that much to offer, but all places of interest (Souk El Had, Marina, Birds Valley,...) are within walking distance. Along with that, the hotel is very much alive all day long. You can either enjoy a day of sunbathing at the pool or private beach, or take part in some of the many activities (water volley, water polo, football, basketball, table tennis, zumba, aqua gym, dancing lessons, cooking classes,...) offered by the animation team of the hotel. In the evening, there are often shows and activities brought by the animation team. The food is also very good and divers (Morrocan + international), with enough choice at every meal for everyone to find something they like. A little downside are the kind of…"
 September 2019,5,Great holiday :).,Great location and service. Very good food with various offers. Manager Mohamed was very friendly and had very professional attitude and communication. All the time when I turned to him was very helpful.
 September 2019,5,Perfect and Relaxing holiday :),"Nice and friendly services. Food was very good and lots of options for eating. Surrounding was Beautiful and private beach was very closed. Manager Mohamed was very kind, polite, friendly and all the time helpful. He has got very proffesional attitude and was nice to speak and meet with him - good luck to your future :)."
 August 2019,2,Mrs Ahmed,We have booked two family rooms when we arrived around 11 pm we were given a standard room really cramped with some removable beds and one family room in floor 1 spoke to reception immediately that we booked two family rooms for 5 adults and 2 children as the class my 16 and 14 years old as adults but they were given children’s beds? Anyhow we didn’t mind the beds as we wanted to enjoy the holiday and not kick a big fuss. In the morning they changed the standard room from 1st floor to 4th floors when I clearly said I want my family close to me .I spoke to managers but non could help me. My family room no fridge No shower curtain ( this was put in after one week after several request for it to be put in and only when I complained to my rep who has been very helpful and kind ) …
 September 2019,5,Vacation,Best holiday in the most luxurious hotels. I am very happy to stay at the allegro hotel .The days were memorable. Thanks to the workers who stay up for our comfort and offer their best. I would like to give thanks to Mr. Mohamed Harkouch was very nice. I am proud to know you. I will come back next time. See you next holiday and you are the best

 August 2019,5,"You wont regret your stay here. A beautiful hotel, location and staff are awesome.",This was our first 4☆ hotel and it didnt disappoint. The staff are truly amazing. The food was lovely and was always something new to try. We even got a guided tour. Make sure you see as much of the entertainment as possible.
 September 2019,5,Excellent service,Very good service and excellent customer experience allegro hotel well done 👍 special service from the jumbo guy named Fouad well organised professional service great service 👍 And I would like any one from you gays to visit this hotel
 September 2019,1,So many things gone wrong,"We (2 adults, 1 child) have stayed here for 2 weeks ( left a few hours ago) all inclusive. For first time ever, we are so glad that our holidays came to an end and we are heading back home which is such a shame, we found it torturous to be in that hotel. Unfortunately I've got to say that this was the worst all inclusive holidays ever we had. Of course there was some positives points which I will mention about 6st of staff were nice and helpful. Particularly I would like to name some of them who were perfect: Abdellah in main bar, Al Arabi the pizza chef, Ismail and Lhabibi in swimming pool's bar, Mohamad Younes and Jamal (he really was a gem) in restaurant. 2- good location 3- upon our arrival about 9pm, they gave us a very small, damped and smelly room (No 80), when I asked…"
 August 2019,5,Great hotel and staff,"I went with my wife and son and another couple with their daughter. We had a wonderful time. The food was good and the animation team was amazing. Big up to the animator Said, we had so much fun together. He even helped us organize a birthday party for my friend. He made us feel welcome and became a family friend. My son was always looking for him. I would recommend this hotel."
 August 2019,5,Mr Hashim,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The receptionists were willing to help with any troubles we had and the assistance was great. A special thanks to Mohamed H who was especially helpful. The food was great, however quite repetitive and not enough variety for small kids. The location was amazing, with the hotel being minutes away from the beach and various restaurants. The rooms were clean, but they were a bit outdated. The wifi was very poor and only worked in the lobby. This is understandable in regards to the size of the hotel. Lots of activities for kids, ranging from sports to a kids club. Overall, we had a great stay and would be willing to visit again."
 August 2019,5,Mlle,"We spent an amazing time, it was very relaxing. We loved the beach and the food was excellent. The staff is great, there was good animation and the duty manager Mohamed is always present to help around."
 August 2019,5,Very nice time,We had a great time with my family will go back food is great services is very good and the good Entertainment We appreciate allegro staffs they are work very hard also they have a great manager who’s call Mohamed
 August 2019,3,Hotel in need of a update.,"Straight to the point: room we had was shabby. The bathroom needed a lot of attention. There was a safe in the room but we had to pay 25 Dirhams per day! The pool area was good. We had to something we thought we would never do, put towels on the sun loungers. If you can’t beat them, join them. The snack bar by the pool served soft drinks as well as local alcohol. The pizza and chips there were actually very good. Lots of activities available from the animation team(all of whom were very friendly and no pressure to join in any activities) Pool area staff friendly enough. Pool appeared clean, we were in the pool most days. This is definitely a hotel for families. As a couple we didn’t mind but we are now coming to point of having adult only holidays! The drinks choice was very…"
 August 2019,5,A week in Allegro Agadir,"We absolutely loved the place. Friendly and polite staff, great food and two minutes walk to the beach. The excursions were amazing and we all came back with feeling refreshed. We'll definitely be coming back again."
 August 2019,2,It’s a shame,"Having stayed in this hotel for times previously in the last 15 years, I think this will be my last time. We had arguments at the check-in which lasted two hours, after having been travelling for many hours beforehand, on a hot day, the booking.com prices versus the hotel prices show the disparity, resulting in us paying a lot more money. At the checkout, we were frightened that we will not be allowed to leave unless a payment had to be cleared, which did not appear the night before the checkout in the hope to avoid this situation, eventually the big manager on the telephone line on the other end very find that all payments were okayed. The rooms were mediocre compare to before, although clean, need repair in many areas including the bathrooms and the lighting and the door…"
 August 2019,1,Awful,"Arrived 16th August and was made to wait 2 hours as they were charging us £60 extra pp for our rooms (there were 12 of us, including 2 children and a 70 yr old) after a lengthy discussion we were not getting anywhere and all paid as we were tired. We had to make our own way to the rooms carrying our cases, we had no idea where our rooms were, the hotel is like a maze! Helpful guests showed us the way as the hotel staff that were walking around just shrugged their shoulders when asked. We were totally amazed (in shock) when we saw our rooms. This hotel is classed 4star the rooms were basic and in total need of updating and repair. My family room consisted of 2 single beds, and a fold away guest bed. We could just about manoeuvre around the room it was so crammed. There was a…"
 August 2019,2,food from hell,"on arrival all seemed well, room was clean staff where helpful, then it all comes to an end. You are shown to your room with a sheet of paper with dining times, that is it your then left to find everything yourself. Rooms were clean on arrival but after this room was just given a simple wipe, bedding never changed in the 2 weeks we were there. Food in hotel was very poor every other night seemed to have a moroccan theme which did no look edible for the most part. On one occasion a child was sick all over the table behind mine and the staff just left it all over the floor until we told them to clean it up. Food was very limited in quality causing us to eat out most nights. The staff was hit or miss, you would get 30% staff are very good, the other 60% would be rude and …"
 August 2019,3,Nice but not 4 star,"My family of 5 stayed on 10 Aug 19 for 7 nights. Overall we had a great time. I've summed up the good/bad bits below. I've given it a 3 rating as the bad bits are significant and drag my scoring down. Good bits; big hotel and nice gardens, lovely pool with spacious lounge area, great staff including animation/entertainment team, nice variety of food, lots of activities to do all day and great entertainment in the evening, 5 minutes to the beach, private beach area, all-inclusive so food and drink available all day. Bad bits; rooms are horrible with dated decor and in need of a professional clean, old boxy TVs with poor reception. High speed wifi? What a joke... in reality there little or none which is a massive disappointment. Hotel Tour rep will sell you excursions at…"
 July 2019,3,So near but so far away from 4 star,"Lets start with we had a great holiday. The food is excellent. The drinks are all inclusive fair ( rough spirits and gassy bear) The one let down is the cleanliness. The place neads a good clean. We arrived pre check in time so had lunch, bbq'd sardines were amazing. We then when to check in and got room 215.. wow what a craphole that was, the sheets hadn't been changed long black hairs in the bed and all over the floor, dirty pillows with fag burns in them and no bed for my daughter, they wheeled a z bed in that looked like it had been kicked round a field for a months first, it was haggid. So we moved / upgraded to room 1 £200 lighter, much better room Loads bigger but still not the cleanest. Maid came faily to make the bed but didnt clean we had a full bin for 5 days. Only…"
 July 2019,5,Mr Mat Hussain,"Hi All Amazing stay at Allegro and had a fantastic welcome from the manager Fatima who was so helpful. The food, the entertainment and resort was amazing !!! Wish I could have stayed there longer. The price was good too for the time of year well done Allegro x Check my Vlog on You Tube for this hotel. Matty247 Many thanks x Matty"
 May 2019,5,Fab hotel,"Went here with my 3 kids aged between 7 & 12 and we all loved it. If you’re after a boring holiday then book somewhere else. The entertainment team where fantastic. There was something going on everyday round the pool for kids and adults. People who complained that the music was to loud should have sat away from the speakers then you wouldn’t have been able to hear the music 🤷🏽‍♀️. The hotel was clean. Yes there was cockroaches (which I hate) but it wasn’t because the hotel was unclean as they seem to be everywhere outside the hotel. The food was very nice. My youngest is a fussy eater and enjoyed the food. It’s in a great location and being on my own with kids it felt safe too. There’s a security guard at the back gate, so if kids do wander away they are stopped at the…"
 August 2019,5,Great hotel,"Great hotel, good food especially for my fussy 13 year old. Entertainment team looked after kids day and night. Manager is always around if there are any problems or concerns. Lifeguards around pool are in the ball and dont just sit there. Entertainment different most nights. Pool towels are quality so no need to take your own heavy ones. Very clean hotel. We booked a couple of tours (outside the hotel) which were a must. City tours, paradise valley, croc parc and jet skis. Mohammed the manager went out of his way when we had an issue of overcharging by a nearby shop and is always around to listen and assist if he can. Wifi was awful but that is being rectified this october I was told by the reception manager. Bottled water with your meal you can then take to your room. Safe can…"
 August 2019,3,Grand,"Upon arrival Allegro Agadir is quite underwhelming. Sparse and vacant reception area , a bar from a pitch and putt club house and not much else. Once checked in and taken to our room , we were satisfied with cleanliness and amenities. A large balcony over looking the pool, quite a comfortable double bed with clean and daily changed linen, a good shower and fine bathroom-The TV channels on offer need a bit more variation , and the picture quality was only ok , we didn’t mind we were only in our room to sleep. We checked in quite late , and were hungry so decided to check out the in house buffet, as we were on an all inclusive package. Not bad at all, everything absolutely edible , some very tasty , booze flowing and friendly staff. The pool area was closed by now - and…"
 August 2019,2,Budget hotel geared for french,"When we arrived at the hotel we’d had a delay from the uk and were all shattered. The reception was all dark and lacked that welcoming feeling. After having to fill out more paperwork, we began the marathon walk to our hotel room. 3 different lifts, up and down stairs and along corridors; 12 minutes later, well and truly lost, we arrived at our dark, dated and dingy room. There was no way we’d find our way from there in the morning but we were too tried by this point. The rooms were disappointing. Old tv that let out a high pitches ring when turned on. Black furniture that has definitely seen better days. Broken chair with no cushion so just a black wooden frame. Broken cupboard and sliding doors on the wardrobe that didn’t slide!... the bathroom door had been oiled previously…"
 August 2019,4,Allegro Hotel - Ambo Tours revie,"Just returned back from a holiday in Agadir in Morocco (Aug 19). We stayed at Allegro hotel in the heart off the city close to the main strip where you can find shops, restaurants and the beach close by which was ideal for exploring on foot. We would like to mention our hotel Ambo Tours rep Fouad who did an excellent job off organising our activity itinerary during our stay which made our holiday very enjoyable. Our taxi driver Bouabid was also another person I would like to thank for his welcoming hospitality and service. Those of you looking for a safe holiday with activities Fouad is the person to approach. All in all a very pleasant holiday and cultural experience. Johnny"
 July 2019,5,Good hotel,Very good staying in allegro. The staff people where really nice. Good food. Good rooms. And everybody is very nice and kind. Whe woud love to come back to allegro in agadir. Very very good hotel we enjoyed
 July 2019,5,Amazing holiday,"The stay at the hotel was great, we stayed a week, the animation team for the kids was great as they always had something to do and they made us feel very welcome and comfortable. The food was really nice. Our rooms were cleaned thoroughly everyday. The hotel was in a great area as it had a private beach two minutes away. We would like to thank Fatima Elkhader with the help and support to find the perfect room for our autistic children she was very helpful and extremely professional with her job. We recommend the trips that the hotel organises because they arent expensive and are worth going on and the tour guide Houcin Addouz was very helpful and made sure to tell us a lot about the town and he made sure we all had fun. We really recommend the hotel for families with children…"
 July 2019,5,Perfect holiday,"Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly. Animation team works hard to make you feel comfortable. We enjoyed most activities especially aqua gym. You get what you paid for. Food is very nice. Rooms cleaned properly every day. Private beach just across the road. Excellent location. A big thank you to duty manager MOHAMED Harkouch who makes extra effort to ensure that everyone is comfortable and happy during their stay. We stayed for 2 weeks and we enjoyed it, pleasant experience. I would highly recommend it for families. شكرا لكل العاملين في المطعم خديجه وفتيحه واكرام."
 July 2019,2,Not a 4 Star. At best a 2 star,"Just got back with my family after staying at this hotel. I share a lot of other guest's thoughts, namely the rooms are tired, the service offered by the reception staff is very poor. We stayed in 2 rooms for 2 weeks beginning 16th Jul 19. I reported an issue with our phone and requested a duvet for one of my children, However the staff at the reception desk just jotted down my request in their book but did nothing about it. I even spoke to the reception manager who was as useful as a pair of glasses on a man with one ear. The food was repetitive and would be great for someone who likes beef stew and lots of it. On a plus side I found the catering staff polite and helpful and would say this was the highlight of our stay. As usual, the hotel will respond with an apology but will…"
 July 2019,5,my stay at the hotel was good and I will come back very soon,"My stay in the context of holidays and business From 24 to 29 July, I present my thanks to all the staff of the hotel for their services and kindness, Sonia, Mohamed, Ali, Laarbi, Najat ... and I recommend this hotel for all visitors to agadir because everything is included with satisfaction"
 August 2018,3,Two/ three star hotel,"The hotel is located in the heart of Agadir. However the hotel was dated, dirty and unloved. Our room smelled of sewage, squeaky bed with dated furniture. The room and bathroom was not cleaned everyday, no clean towels and no tissues. Bossy tour guide named Fauwad from jumbo tours, very rude and arrogant. Receptionist were least helpful."
 July 2019,5,My stay at the hotel was good and I will come back very soon,"My stay in the context of holidays and business, I present my thanks to all the staff of the hotel for their services and kindness, Sonia, Mohamed, Ali, Laarbi, Najat ... and I recommend this hotel for all visitors to agadir because everything is included with satisfaction"
 July 2019,5,Family Stay,WOW I honestly wouldn’t have believed I would have got the stay I did especially with what I paid. Says 4 star but better than many 5star hotels I’ve stayed in. Staff are very friendly. Atmosphere and work ethic from the bravo team was incredible. But I want to say a BIG thank you to Mohamed the manager whose picture I’ve attached who always went up and beyond his duty and assisted anyone and everyone Where needed. No matter where you go in Agadir you’ll find french is the primary language spoken but not for this hotel the management have recognised this and have started ensuring activities and shows are also aimed for British tourists. Don’t hesitate and book this place well worth it. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.
 June 2019,3,Get what you pay for,This was our first trip to Morocco and the first thing I should mention is take a pen cause you'll need it at the airport. When we arrived at the airport we had to complete an entry form which was fine except for the fact that there was only one pen for the entire plane of passengers. It would have been so much better if these forms had been given out on the plane or at least informed us before hand. We arrive at the hotel and received a nice welcome which included a cocktail...good start. Unfortunately check-in was not so good as the male receptionist (tall man with glasses) was not pleasant or helpful. He didn't even tell us which direction our room was and seemed very put out when we asked him which way it was. The other reception staff we encountered over the next couple of…
 July 2019,1,Group holiday at the Allegro,"Hotel was dated, some of the rooms smelled of sewage, saw several cockroaches, a few of us unwell from eating food. Good location to the beach, pool was sufficient, weather is apparently cloudy a lot in Agador so not for sun worshippers Reception staff the worst I have ever come across"
 July 2019,4,Family holiday,"Together with family and friends we visited Allegro Agadir this year July.Lets start from the fact that we had two autistic children with us what might be interesting to some people. The day we arrived we didn’t like the room as it was too far from the pool. The rooms were changed for us next day . We’ve been given big rooms next to the pool and bottle of champagne. All was sorted by Fatima and her team . Just ask for her in reception. She looked after our kids and asked for them every day. Pool it’s self was very good, lots of great different stuff in snack bar. Animations and the whole team were brilliant. Lots of activity’s and dance. Everyone very welcoming and tolerant. The children never been told that they act weirdly or different. They were free to dance, swim the own…"
 July 2019,4,Overall good hotel with great location,"Good clean rooms, decent food and 2minute walk to beach from back entrance. Would definitely book this hotel again. Staff were friendly and helpful. The only bad thing was WiFi was very limited - only available in the lounge and even then in certain areas"
 July 2019,5,"Nice stay, excellent food.","Our room was clean and frequently checked on, food was outstanding and service was flawless. Private beach area was a big advantage! Rooms could be renovated soon as others wrote, but it was clean and the bed was comfortable, no major problem here. Wifi is poor though it didnt bother us at all, could enjoy the vacation totally. No signal in our room and common areas had slow speed and not everywhere / everytime."
 July 2019,5,Wonderful Stay,"Very beautiful hotel with private beach. Staff are very helpful and specially Fatima was very helpful. She helped with giving us comfortable rooms, arranged transport and also printed boarding pass for us."
 July 2019,5,Allegro,"First time in Morocco, lovely hotel and staff animation always friendly and helpful, warm hearted, if you need to ask any question or need something the animation is always there highly recommended will visit again :)"
 July 2019,4,Taste of Maroco - interesting leasure and relax,"If you need good Relax, you Will find all in this hotel. If you need WiFi in the room, stay at home. I was very glad with amazing animators - even if you do not speak English and French, for sure you Will understand all attractions. You could spend actively Time near swimming pools, playing the aqua volley, tenis, dancing or making aqua gym. Every evening was also different. During the night was disco for Young people or for people in the middle age who feel good music and do not want to sleep at 11 pm. Beach is Sandy with seperated place for quests from hotel. Equipment at the Beach is fee of charge. Ocean is an excellent. Beach is located close hotel, Just you can cross the street. Hotel is surrounded by shops, restaurants, but hotel could gain 5 stars for delishious meals and…"
 July 2019,4,Really good just wouldn’t necessarily go back,Lovely entertainment team however staff were really rude at times and it got really frustrating. However lovely place and stay and beds are comfy. Enjoyed it and was fun but definitely not going back .
 July 2019,1,Fake advertising,Not what I paid for.. Paid for a double bedroom with king size bed and was given a bedroom with 2 single beds. (could be put together.. With a gap on the middle? Fre WiFi???? Where?!not in the bedrooms... Very noisy.. Deep bath??? Where?? Spa?? Where???? 2 restaurants??? Where?!?

 June 2019,3,Has Points to improve,"For a 4Star hotel has to improve the internal communication anf staff of the reception, improve the cleaning of the rooms (towels and sheets)and pool bar (No reuse plastic cups). The hotel has a very nice animation program, has 2 nice pools and it's near to the beach and tourist spots."
 July 2019,5,Super holiday,"Simohamed Amoune and Karim commia de rang are the best waiter on the hotel!!!! 😍 They dont leave your glass empty. They are very friendly, kind and nice men at hotel.

 June 2019,5,Great Holidays,"First i want say thank you to all staff to make my stay so pleasant and wonderful. Thank you to the barmen Rachid and Abdulah, who were always friendly and goodhumored. The best from the hotel is the sport entertainment team. Big thank to the ""dreamteam"" Abdel and Momo, who are working all day long very professional and with motivation. I am sure, I come back again!"
 May 2019,5,Allegro Agadir made my daughter's birthday truly magical,"My daughter & I spent a week at Allegro Agadir in May 2019 to celebrate her 22nd birthday. It was my third visit to Agadir, but my daughter's first visit. We are so happy that we chose to stay at Allegro Agadir - the staff are fantastic. Their customer service, friendliness and attentiveness was excellent - close to any we've experienced in higher, 5*-rated hotels. I advised the hotel ahead of our stay that we were coming to celebrate my daughter's birthday and they truly gave her a magical birthday from start to finish. Things we loved: Allegro Agadir is located less than a minute's walk from the beach and promenade, which is wonderful. The hotel itself is visually appealing and spacious. The public areas are kept clean throughout the day and gardeners ensure that the hotel…"
 June 2019,5,Great stay,"Thank you to all the staff for making the stay so pleasant and relaxing. Great quality buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner, something different every day. Pool water warm. Rooms clean, any issues resolved quickly and without eyerolls (rarer than you'd think...)"
 June 2019,3,Nice week away!,"Hotel is nice and well looked after, staff are very friendly and helpful and the entertainment is good! Food was alright, always something you could eat but hard to get a table sometimes. Snack bar is great with fresh pizza. Lobby bar is small but staff work hard and always collecting classes and seating people. Nice to see the management involved with guests, disappointed to have reported an issue to the manager that we ensured would be dealt with but was not. Other than that, lovely week in the sun!"
 June 2019,3,Ok,"Stayed here beginning of June arrived 10am room not available till 3 never had that anywhere else, received our bands though went for food and chill till room ready. Room 329 very dated and tired complained was told all rooms the same and they would get back to me next day never happened ! Asked around other rooms better.only slept and showered there though but if ur looking for luxury don't book here, not a 4star. Food amazing that's why they get a 3 couldn't fault the food at all enough variety for any pallet. morrocon night out of this world. Staff work so hard in the restaurant and bar, they keep the hotel afloat. Animation team work long hours and do a fab job,well done guys. Would we return no."
 June 2019,5,"Fabulous week,","Had a fab first time in more, this hotel made it easy for us to relax, was hassle free and I'm a beautiful setting, 2 min walk from the hotel to miles of stunning beach and restaurants, locals are friendly and the the sellers understand the word no and leave you alone, the sunsets are well worth going to see, comes highly recommended, definitely coming back"
 May 2019,5,Lovely hotel,"Me and my family stayed here for a week in may....the weather was glorious 32-36°...the food was nice and I loved all of the traditional Moroccan food and the theme night too was lovely....there is so much culture in morocoo I absolutely loved it. Our room was a little small but for how long we were in the room it really didn't matter....it was clean and comfortable!....The pool area was fab as were the entertainments team....my daughter made loads of friends and said she had the best holiday....it is just across a road from the beach and the hotel has it's own private section....the beach is beautiful and sandy!! we enjoyed the excursions and there was definitely something for everyone to enjoy, we would love to reccomend this hotel to everyone :) ...thanks for a lovely holiday"
 June 2019,4,Brilliant,"Great value for money! Fantastic food Very helpful and friendly bar and entertainment staff. Clean and comfortable rooms Lovely swimming pool. Only negative thing- the entertainment was only in French and Arabic even though the staff could talk English ( even the quiz). Furthermore, no English music played in the disco even on the 1980’s night."
 June 2019,1,Would not go back!,"The rooms are very dated but do the job however pretty sure the sheets were not changed apparently if you tipped the cleaner they would be! The animation team are absolutely lovely and really do go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The reception staff are not quite as helpful, our transfer did not pick us up on the way home and they did not let us use the phone because it was a UK number and also check out is supposed to be 12pm but they locked us out of our room at 11.15! When we went to reception we was told we had 10 minutes to get out as they needed to clean the room! The food was actually pretty good so no issues there, variation everyday and the pool bar staff are also really nice. The lobby bar staff we found very sarcastic and slow, we asked for 4 drinks due…"
 June 2019,1,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ALEGRO,"Our first time to to Agadir, me and my Mrs booked allegro, we booked A double bed with TV, Fridge, when we arrived the room looked very poor from the pictures, X2 single beds, a 1990s Box TV, No fridge and light bulbs not working, I called the reception numerous times they kept cutting me off and, kept making excuses, it was like a back street Blackpool hotel! I would not come here again for sure!!"
 March 2019,5,Very good hotel. Ignore the bad reviews.,"Stayed in this hotel twice now. Last year June and this year March. The hotel could do with a bit of renovation but it’s good for what you pay. Food - excellent! Couldn’t fault. Heavily recommended. Animation team - very good If you do excursions book with faoud, very good guy and will give you the best prices. If you are picky with food, there is a KFC, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and loads of top places to eat within a 5-10 minute walk. Eat at Toros steakhouse 😍 Overall, very good hotel."
 May 2019,1,RUINED Family Holiday !!!! Worse hotel I ever been to .,"Dirty rooms cockroaches in bathroom . Everyone just see money nothing else. We pay for three rooms one was 2 adults one Child with only two beds ,guy at the reception said they doesn’t have any other ones . My parents room was dirty and bathroom wasn’t clean at all. My granma room has No cold water So she couldn’t take shower . Once again there is many other places you Can choose . But avoid this one . Rude managment shautong at people in the restaurant If they ask for table for more then 2 people . They mainly speaking french."
 May 2019,4,Very nice stay,"Very nice hotel,pleasant experience. On arrival while waiting for room got coctails and we were taken care of immidiately. Rooms clean but in family rooms no separation from kids beds so me and partner didn’t have any privacy...lots of nice gardens and surrounding especially look beautiful at night...good food with big choice, a lot of Moroccan food as well...a bit boring breakfast same every day but over all nice... Friendly bar staff making strong drinks :-) very friendly staff always helpful...animation team is getting more friendly when they get to know you after few days and some of them don’t speak good English but lots of sports going on and they are great with kids especially evening activities they always give kids lots of attention...close to private beach which is…"
 May 2019,5,Birthday,We came here for a week in the sun with fun and this is what we had A 50th birthday was very enjoyable and a great time The pool activities was good and the food was nice and plenty to eat we had a pool view which was really nice
 May 2019,5,Great hotel,"It was in a nice location and the services were brilliant. The entertainment was for all ages and was really fun. The swimming pool was fantastic and the baby pool was a great idea. Overall, i would recommend this amazing hotel to anyone."
 May 2019,5,Best holiday,"What a fabulous week x the staff were non stop. The hotel may need a lick of paint here and there, but beds clean, food good, the location and entertainment were great. There,is the Tantan club that rounded off the night. Few tips, if going to the souk, we paid £12 each in the hotel, we could have got a taxi straight there for 20-30 dirham approx 2.50 each way, camel rides and henna are cheaper on the beach, haggle. The great people we met, the willingness of the staff was content. Would definitely return xx loved it xxx"
 May 2019,5,Another Great Allegro Holiday,"This was our 7th time at this hotel and it met expectations yet again! Staff, from the Hotel Manager down to cleaners and security ensure you have a wonderful time. Don't take our word for it, book it soon!!"
 May 2019,5,Brilliant hotel,"Once again, Allegro did not let us down.From management to cleaners. Over and above hospitality. Fantastic hotel, not 5 star by far, but you feel like you are in a 5 star plus. Highly recommend this little haven."
 May 2019,3,True opinion about Allegro Agadir,"The hotel in the pictures made a huge impression. Unfortunately, the photos were nilter to the state of the rooms. Bathrooms on a terrible level. The towels did not look good. Bed sheets and curtains with permanent large stains. Several times in the corridor we met with cockroaches. Drinks mugs for dirty drinks, as if they were only overfilled. As for the kitchen, very monotonous and unfortunately caused indigestion. Instead of juices from the machine, only water was often used. A very specific, disgusting smell in the dining area. A big plus of the hotel was its location, very nice service and swimming pool."
 May 2019,4,Nice time,Very pleasant stay - I would return but factor in eating out . And also would like some drinks on the beach. WiFi is not good so be prepared The drinks are ok all local brands And you cannot purchase branded drinks
 May 2019,4,Pleasant stay,"Reception. Greeted by Karim, very polite gentleman. Arrived at approx midday was informed that room not ready but to go for lunch First. Room 418 Room always cleaned, very quite with lovely view. Had everything needed for a weeks stay. 2 pillows per bed with continental quilt. Bed extremely comfortable. Restaurant Always something edible but sometimes the choice would be odd. Freshly made omelets and fried eggs made to order at breakfast. 2 choices of yogurt plain/vanilla. Food variation could be improved. Pool area/snack bar. Only used snack bar for soft drinks. Area always clean and plenty of sun beds as hotel only 50% booked. Not enough parasols. Lounge bar Pleasant area. Animation Always tried to get guests involved day and evening but not too invasive. Special…"
 May 2019,2,Needs a lot a money spent on it,2/3* hotel. Location good close to shops and restaurants. Beautiful beach which hotel has private area. Not enough sun beds though. Hotel it’s self very run down. Needs updating in all areas. Meals times need to be longer especially dinner. Restaurant needs redesigning (food was cold most of the time) Bar closes far to early (11pm) entertainment team need training as really didn’t know what to do. Honestly felt like we were in an old fashion holiday camp at times. (Musical chairs in the evening ! really ). Overall didn’t live up to what it was advertised as. Unless completely refurbished and under new management we would not stay here again
 May 2019,5,Perfect holiday,Overall this was a decent hotel. Can’t complain at the price we paid. Food was good. Friendly staff. Very close to the beach. Drinks available from 10am-1am. Rooms cleaned properly everyday. Lots of activities to do
 November 2018,4,Repeat visit,"We spent 2 weeks at the Allegro in November. After a not very pleasant transfer ( not the hotel's fault ) we arrived too late to eat in the restaurant but were pleased to find a plate of meat and salad in our room. My husband is disabled and uses a mobility scooter, this had been damaged in the transfer making it unuseable. Reception sent an engineer to repair it so we were set to enjoy our holiday. We were on the ground floor, the fridge was not working but Zora, our lovely maid sorted that problem, she was great, the room was cleaned regularly, always replaced any towels we had used. Food; good selection and choice available at breakfast, lunch and dinner, always helpful staff serving and waiting. The waiters were sometimes a little too eager to remove your plate. The tea…"
 September 2018,5,Excellent stay,"Stayed there with my husband last year, and ..... we are going there again!!! It is a very friendly hotel, particularly the lady at the reception named Sukineh (sorry if the spelling is wrong), who sorted everything what was not perfect at the beginning and was always nice and helpful and very professional. The animation team - fantastic!!! I would like to also thank to all the waiters and the kitchen stuff, who were rushing and working very hard to make every visitor satisfied. Rooms nice, clean, due to lovely and hardworking cleaning ladies. The pool area nice and clean, maybe the only thing was the choice of music...? When we travel to Morocco, we would love listen to some lovely Arabic music!!! Food - more than satisfying! As I said - we loved it, felt last year our stay…"
 May 2019,3,Could have been better,"Very basic hotel and you get what you pay for, if going out of the hotel for a drink it’s more expensive than the uk, food was ok never hungry but some very strange choices not to everyone’s taste, you have to use a proper bank to withdraw cash, the ordinary cash machines not connected to the internet, we had to rely on other holiday makers to tell us this, overall a nice break but basic"
 May 2019,4,Sun filled holiday with my partner!,"Stayed here with my partner between 7th-14th May. Generally had a good stay, lovely pool area which was never too crowded, could usually grab an umbrella for my sun fearing boyfriend! The food could sometimes be a bit bland and lacking in choice, found by the end of the week we were seeing repetitive dishes, but as not fussy eaters we always found something to eat! Would happily come back again for a week away in the sun to get away and forget work and life stresses!"
 May 2019,1,Holiday,"It was awful the reception staff rude, the pool and pool area was filthy I had to wipe the sun loungers down with baby wipes the wipe was black also the floor was extremely dusty and fag ends. Would of been some nice gardens with water features a few years ago but sadly it’s now not well kept and rubble. with a little tlc and some better manners could of been so much better!"
 May 2019,1,Very very very poor,We arrived at this hotel at 11am this morning given that we booked this with a travel agent you would have thought they would have accommodated an early check in or at least be shown to you room or a guided tour to kill some time but no No NO! You are left to walk around and find something to do while you wait for you room!!! Which you can only check in at 15pm - the lady on reception needs little work in manners understand of the guest too! We have travel with 2 kids and my wife and have been up since 12.00pm midnight to arrive to the really poor service Just wanted to share this with you all Cheers
 May 2019,1,"Definitely not a 4 star, 2star at best","Well first impressions when we arrived at Lunchtime was not to bad, we then went for drink, drinks served in Tumblers your Grandmother used to put her false teeth in at nightime. Food - Breakfast not too bad, fresh fruit on offer plus freshly cooked Omlettes. Lunch was overcooked fish and Chicken. At one lunch sitting I left nearly a complete plate of food it looked and tasted disgusting. I went to get Pizza from the Snack bar, in my absence a Waiter picked up the plate of food and angrily thrust the plate of food into my Fiance's face and accused her of wasting food. The whole restaurant stopped and turned round. My partner then proceeded to ask for the Manager, who pleaded with us not to place a review on Trip advisor (too late). On our return to the room there was a basket of…"
 May 2019,5,Best holiday! Had such a wonderful experience here.,Just came back from Allegro hotel with six friends and we all had a Wonderful experience. The food was just amazing- a good variety of tasty food. Very impressed. The snack bars freshly made pizzas were also amazing. Beach was beautiful and I enjoyed relaxing around the pool. The pool side entertainment was good fun. The staff were ever so friendly and really went out of there way to Make it a fun experience. Evening entertainment was great- Moroccan night was amazing. Wonderful trip- would definitely recommend this hotel. Got no complaints- everything was perfect. Had such a great time.
 April 2019,4,Great hotel for a bargain holiday in Agadir! We loved it!,"It was our 1st time in Morocco, so wasn't too sure of what to expect. We had a very happy stay at the Allegro Agadir. We arrived a little early for check in at 3pm, but were given our A/I wristbands by lovely, helpful staff at the reception and allowed to go grab some lunch and use the facilities while we waited for our room. Room was more than big enough for 2, with powerful shower and bath, WC and bidet. Large wardrobe, TV with mainly french channels (there is an English channel showing movies) and small fridge. Balcony with table and chairs. Very comfy beds and beds made when required (just leave your sign hanging on your door handle!) Could have done with more than one towel each - but the hotel hires towels at a small charge, so I guess that's why. Food choice small…"
 May 2019,4,You Get What You Pay For!,"My wife and I booked this for a spot of sun and to visit a new country. True, after reading previous reviews we were slightly concerned about what we might have let ourselves in for. However, we were pleasantly surprised at what we met. 1 Airport Arrival Get ready for long queues and have a pen ready to fill in the arrival form. 2 Jumbo Taxis We had pre booked a taxi but there was no obvious person to meet us at arrival with the usual named board. No problem on the way back 3 The Hotel As everyone notes the rooms are tired and in need.of a bit of TLC. However our room was cleaned daily to a high standard. 4 Food We thought that the food was excellent and varied. You might struggle with kids unless you want them to eat pizza and chips at the snack bar every day. 5 Entertainment …"
 May 2019,4,"Value for money, great location","My husband & I have just returned from the Allegro. Having been to Morocco before I was aware of what to expect in relation to a 4* hotel there, I’d say it’s a good 3*. The hotel itself appears to of recently changed names and the new? Management are keen to make sure everything is going ok, you can constantly see them around the pool / meal times. So, where to begin.. Pool; the area is nicely laid out, good pool for the kids, although a chilly pool it was nice once in & a relief from the Moroccan sun. The loungers (plenty of them & no crazies up at 6am putting towels out) in my opinion, should be hosed down and the surrounding areas cleaned a little more frequently (the pool was) the bar staff are constantly collecting rubbish and cups meaning we saw very few wasps around…"
 May 2019,3,Value for money,"Official pictures are deceiving. We had to change rooms 3 times on the first day when we checked in. But the staff were really nice Not really a 4 star, if u have traveled the world. More like 3 star. Food is excellent. Hats off to the animation team. They were actively involved with every part of your stay in welcoming and dining and nightly entertainment. Overall it was a safe place for kids and very secure property."
 January 2019,4,Nice stay.,"My friend and I stayed here for 4 nights in January. Hotel itself is somewhat average, food was reasonably good. The animation team made our stay, very friendly and always providing entertainment. Night club generally empty but good fun after a few drinks! We paid very little and were pleasantly surprised."
 April 2019,4,Pleasant stay,"We had pleasant stay. My daughter loved animation team. Every day program for guests, you can choose what you prefer. Food was delicious, hotel´s staff was really friendly. Hotel is situated near the beach close to promenade. Wifi didn´t work in the room only by the pool or in restaurant."
 April 2019,5,"loved the hotel, loved the holiday!","we loved staying at Allegro Agadir. There was nothing we could fault. the entertainment crew were brilliant in engaging the everyone and getting everyone involved in activities, etc. the food, the entertainment, the amenities and the activities all were excellent. we didn't have to go out for anything because there was so much to do within the complex. the Bravo Club staff were very friendly and welcoming, keep it up. will definitely come back and have already recommended to friends and family. the only downfall was the Wifi which only worked in the reception area and was temperamental."
 May 2019,1,Noisy ! Cockroaches! Rude reception!,Food was ok only a little repetitive. Two out of the many bar staff were polite the rest were pretending they hadnt seen you till they could be bothered . Pools cold but ok once you get in. When you arrive make sure you get a receipt for your local tax payment as reception will try to charge you again when you leave! Very intimidating but there was no way i was going to pay twice . Music is loud all day by the pool so no peace and quiet If you do choose to go here dont have any rooms lower than reception below that is cockroache infested . Over the week we counted about 10 a day. Twice we had one in our room . Put a towel on the floor near the door will stop them getting in but really you shouldnt have to . If you get given room 144 dont take it ask for a different one…
 April 2019,5,"Beautiful Holiday I've enjoyed ""Peace and quiet""","Allegro hotel is an excellent pace for family, easy access to the beach and local amenities I enjoyed every single day of my stay with them. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is excellent and Allegro hotel is one of the best place you can enjoy a variety of foods. I have read a lot of negative comments before I traveled but I can tell you that I haven't come across any bad experience. I will definitely go back again with my family. My kids love it and they were nearly in tears when it comes to an end of the holiday."
 April 2019,3,Upgrade,🙁 Food options needs to be more kids friendly. Rooms need upgrading. Some staff at reception were helpful and some of them no help at all. Location is not too bad at all using back door you can get to beach in two mins.
 April 2019,5,The best hotel I’ve stayed in.,"I’ve just come back from a 1 week holiday with my partner. On our first day we arrived at the hotel at about 10 o’clock so the restaurant was closed. Without asking, the hotel staff said they would bring food into our room. This took over an hour and half to arrive!! My partner carried on calling them and each time they said 10 minutes. When it did arrive, it was just piece of bread, two slices of cheese and some fruit. If we knew that was all we would get and how it long it would have took, we would have eaten out. So if you are due to arrive late hours be prepared. Also on arrival the hotel rep took our holiday information off us which was given to us on our transfer and had all the information about our transfer back. As we didnt attend the rep meeting the next day (we…"
 November 2018,1,Stay away! horrible rude staff and horrible atmosphere,"this had made me never to return to morocco! management was very horrible there was alot of ignoring and not being looked after compared to the others. this was my first time in morocco and i can say unless yourenglish, french.german you will be looked after-any other shade of skin colour your ignored! the food was bland and even going inclusive i ate out to the few restaurants along the beach. also the animation please be wary, they come across nice but i had one steal money from me and not give it back to me when she promised she would return it. over 300 dirhams! first night i was there i was ignored at the bar and was told in an agressive manner to not talk to the bar staff, when i was not being served! also you do get ripped off in thisplace and bombard you with offers…"
 March 2019,4,Fun in the sun,"We had a lovely time at the Allegro hotel, wonderful super friendly and attentive staff, a lovely pool and the food was incredible. The entertainment team worked very hard and were all very friendly and fun. Although I will say it’s perhaps a little too much sometimes trying to get people involved in activities and games when you just want to relax. Great facilities though, table tennis, basketball and tennis courts, darts board, chess, nightclub, karaoke, theatre, morrocan tea room, you name it they had it! Room wise, we booked a double standard room, just a heads up, although it says 4 star, think premier inn when it comes to a standard room. Quite small and very basic, but clean and a comfortable bed and good shower. Also bear in mind it says wi fi on the website but wi fi is…"
 March 2019,5,"Great value for money, better than expected","Stayed in Mar/April 2019 so not peak-season and weather was great. The hotel is very nice, the food was plenty full with good choice of buffet meals. The pool area was great, plenty of sunbeds, shade areas, snacks included. The location was great, not right on beach but very short walk. Good value for money, only gripe is lack of wifi and the pool was bit cold"
 March 2019,5,Excellent hotel,"Hi everyone I would like to share my experience holiday in this occasion Hotel stuff very friendly and helpful Restaurant amazing food Also customer service astonishing Tour guide was very friendly professional, very kind and very good attitude always on time the best ever holiday I have experienced with the tour guide (Fouad) See you in August again Fouad thanks 🙏 for everything you done for us."
 March 2019,4,Nice staff and food,"We had ordered a prebooked taxi which took us to the hotel in half an hour. We got our plastic green band and everything inside the hotel was free. We got our room. It was clean but not anything extra. The view from our room was nothing but it was situated very good. Not too long to walk. We arrived rather late. Got our dinner and could sit outside (this was medio March) which we can't in Sweden. Then we sat in the bar. we were invited to take part in the dancing. e didn't at the time known that the was the staff sowing around. The food was good and varied and the staff took care of everyone. Dancing, gym, entertainment. They were very friendly. A place you can go to on your one without feeling lonely."
 March 2019,3,Dont use service from Abdul-excursion guy!!!,"Hotel was ok,nice food and servise for that value,nice location! But I was really disaponted with guy Abdul-exursion guy-he take from us 150€,and just bring us to Paradise Valley,but should be more...."
 March 2019,4,Good But So Easily Could Be Better,"I rated as very good but would have preferred the option of just good as it's better than average. I will focus on positives first as there are more of those than negatives. I found the food to be excellent in terms of both quality & choice, the food refreshed & replenished regularly at all meals. The staff were friendly & eager to please in all areas, the animation team are a lovely enthusiastic group of young people, I do not usually like to single any one person out but in this case I have to Momo is a really super young man and worthy of praise. The hotel is very clean and the staff work tirelessly to ensure that. The negatives are that whilst I have no problem with music being played all of the time the volume was just too much and meant it was difficult to escape it and…"
 March 2019,4,Value for money,"Just returned home and had a lovely 7 nights. The hotel is a bit dated but the staff worked tirelessly every day to ensure everyone could be involved in activities if they desired. The food was ok, some days better than others but again the staff worked hard every day servicing the restaurant. The location was excellent, 2 minutes walk to the private beach and only 30 minutes taxi from the airport. The weather was great, averaging in the mid 20’s every day. In summary for a budget all inclusive holiday we couldn’t ask for more. For people expecting 5* quality and service they should consider paying 5* prices if their expectations aren’t met."
 March 2019,5,Best all inclusive in Agadir,"One of the best price-oriented hotel in Agadir. You receive a lot for the rate you pay. Excellent service, employees and cleaning personnel. I have nothing bad to say about whole experience. We all felt wonderful"
 March 2019,4,Value hotel,Alegro hotel agadir . A clean and friendly hotel which could benifit with a coat of paint here and there just returned from a week there plenty to do close to the beach with own area. The food was good mainly tagine dishes but always a daily fish dish salad bar and something cooked on the barbeque plenty of salads and deserts. If you do fancy wondring out accross the road there are many very good restaurants and bars including an English bar and also an Irish bar I went all inclusive and the drinks where pretty good.The snack bar in the afternoon offers pizza and chips and a selection of cakes in the afternoon with bar attached to snack bar. Nice pool area and childrens club . And for the disco divas there is a disco open untill 1am .All in all a pleasant experience.
 February 2019,3,ismail,it was a average hotel but the staff were brilliant ibrahim and fahad the reception wer all brilliant but i think the rooms need improving and the bathrooms but great location right on the beach.......
 March 2019,2,March Holiday,"The room we were allocated was overlooking a large concrete roof. Balcony had sun for 1 hour of the day. We asked for a move on three consecutive days to be told sorry you have to wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow never arrives and no room change Issues with room: Black mould in the bathroom ceiling, black mould on surfaces, all due to lack of ventilation in the bathroom. Curtains do not shut fully as to short for the track. Large gap under room door and large amount of light coming through makes sleeping difficult. General appearance of the room is it should have been refreshed / updated at least 5 years ago. Public areas much better looked after. Food: Very small selection with mostly low cost meat being used. Example tonight's meal meat options were fish, cows hoof or neck of…"
 February 2019,5,A very pleasant surprise!,"This hotel will be refurbished in the not too distant future but it is still a wonderful place to stay within a few metres of a huge sandy beach and wide promenade with cafes and restaurants. The relaxed atmosphere, friendly and courteous staff throughout and superb cuisine - definitely a cut above most all-inclusive hotel food - combined with the lovely Moroccan weather made for a relaxing stay."
 March 2019,1,Do my go please,I travelled to the hotel on my own on business I got this hotel st the last moment when I arrived I was told my room was not ready ok I told the reception I will have a drink at the bar I was told the bar was closed as it was 1.am ok can i order some room device and put it on my bill I was told no I asked is the any way I could get a drink thay told me across the road to the hotel in a bar I then asked how long for my room thay told me 1 hour I was not happy but I went to the main gate to look were the bar was I was met by a taxi driver who offers to take me to the bar for 200 Dar I told him no thanks then a girl asked me she would show me for 100 Dar so I went back to recpion and waited till 2 45 and I got my room I complained to the manager but no feed back was given the…
 March 2019,5,GREAT HOTEL! GREAT STAFF! GREAT WEATHER!,We stayed 1 week in allegro hotel agadir. Staff was amazing! Fouhad the jumbo tour rep was absolutely great! Anything we needed help with he was there for us whatever time of day! We booked with rep fouhad the buggy riding it was the best! We booked paradise valley with the rep was beautiful and such a great experience! Also booked a 2hour hamen massage was lovely! Abdel I think his name is 1 of the bravo club reps he was great! He made us feel involved in activities everyday! Hotel was that good we are coming back next month!
 March 2019,5,Winter ☀,"Staff very welcoming, hotel very clean. Food excellent, so tasty fab choice and waiters very attentive. Room size okay, nice and clean. The pool was freezing, but it was March. Lots of sports and entertainment. Private beach was a bonus. We would visit again."
 February 2019,1,UPDATE - POOR RESPONSE FROM HOTEL REGARDING MONEY STOLEN FROM ROOM,"This review is an update from my last review which was written whilst in resort. We had a great holiday but sadly had money stolen from our room (we were three floors up and no access to room via balcony) in a similar circumstance to a previous guests review, this was reported. On our last day we also had money that was left for our maid taken, I luckily went back to the room after being suspicious of a member of staff and found it had been taken before we left (not by the maid). The hotel reception staff acted on my suspicions and the money was returned by the member of staff. On my return home I emailed management 2 times and followed it up with a fax, explaining what had happened and asking them to look into the member of staff who was a supervisor and had free access to…"
 February 2019,4,Winter sunshine break,"We arrived at 9pm to be told by reception that dinner was served until 9.30, drop your bags and go and eat. This done we came back to a queue to check in - lots of forms and paying city tax followed. Taken to our room which was clean and on ground floor. We found the food at all meals to be very tasty, varied and nicely presented, the tagines were our favourites and gluten free so hubby could enjoy them too. Desserts were lovely for me but a struggle for anything gluten free, though one chef wised up and cut bases off some so the topping could be eaten with fruit. The pool area was kept very clean (as were public areas) but the water was so cold we didn't attempt a swim. Nice snack bar near pool which served pizza and chips and a bar for drink. The beach was just across road…"
 March 2019,3,Winter holiday,After reading the reviews on trip advisor we decided to find out for ourselves. Upon arrival we were charged tourist tax which I didn't expect as we only had hand luggage we never took beach towels with us as we knew that u could hire them. They charged us £20 each and said u get it back at the end of the week we were shocked it was so expensive but paid it. We went to get a towel but it was around 3 in the afternoon they said they had run out and come back tomorrow we got there early the next morning to be told they had run out again. My husband went to reception and complained they didn't try to sort it so he got our money back. The room we had was nice very clean and the cleaner came every day the whole hotel was clean and tidy and well kept. The pool was absolutely freezing…
 March 2019,1,Disastrous stay,Completely mis sold room. Did not provide a single benefit that was advertised. Nothing was done or improved after complaining numerous times.there are no friends allowed in the hotel even at day time to spend some time to rest.
 March 2019,3,Led Almohades agadir,"We arrived at 12pm to be told the rooms were being cleaned and would be available at 3pm, we were told to go for lunch and come back, once we had checked in we were informed there was a tax of £21 to stay in the hotel and £20 deposit for each pool towel. At no point we were told where the bar the pool or the restaurant was it was a case of find it yourself. Normally hotels give you some.sort of map to help you. We got into the room at 3pm and I have to say I was shocked it was covered in dust and very dated the bath enamel was peeling off and it was rusty underneath also hairs in the bath so not a good start the room to be honest was.disgusting. The only positive thing in there was the tv. The bathroom was in a bad state of repair and to find hairs on a floor that had supposedly…"
 March 2019,5,Vacation,Amazing staff who are very friendly and helpful can't really complain about anything.The food was perfect and there was a different choice daily.Is not far from the marina and shops/restaurant.Will definitely come here again.
 February 2019,5,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here for a week and we were really impressed with everything from the quality of food, staff engagement, cleanliness of rooms, the pool area and the overall relaxing atmosphere. The private beach is a bonus and 5 minutes walk from the hotel. I would definitely return and recommend. The only improvement area is the check in process which is quite lengthy."
 March 2019,4,Nice hotel in a great location,"In a nutshell, this place is very good. I had a great week staying at the Allegro Agadir last week. The staff are very friendly and the entertainers work extremely hard in trying to get people involved. From day one the entertainers would come around for a talk and a classic 'high five' and nothing was ever too much. The room was nice and modern but my room didn't have a shower curtain and being placed on the ground floor near the theatre I could hear the staff as early as 6 am, but this wasnt a huge issue or I would have complained. The concierge staff were great and made sure my bags were taken care of the moment I arrived and when I was leaving. The food was great with variety every night. Yes, there wasn't an awful lot to pick from but there was more than enough foods…"
 February 2019,4,winter sun,This is our first visit to Agadir We stayed at the allegro for three nights on all inclusive in February 2019 We arrived at 9pm it took us about 30 minutes to check in and pay for the tourist taxes etc they overcharged us for this so it is worth double checking as no receipt was given for this We requested a room safe code but were unable get this for twenty four hours so we had to carry our passports and valuable items with us not great service We were allocated room 151 given a room card there was no offer of any directions it was at the furthest end of the complex in another building with a very strange numbering system this took us twenty minutes to find in the dark When found the room was a little bit dated but everything worked The food in the buffet…
 February 2019,4,"Wonderful week in the sun, great value hotel","We have just returned from a great week at the Allegro, we were a bit worried prior to going, due to some of the negative comments from previous reviews. The staff couldn't do enough for us, the food was really good, tasty and varied - although if you want to eat Michelin star food or English food, stay somewhere else! The drinks were served in small plastic cups around the pool but you could order as many drinks as you could carry. The beer is bottled and decent, the wine & spirits are also good. The drinks in the bar were also served in small glasses but again you can order as much as you can carry. We never had a problem getting a drink, a table in the restaurant or a sunbed. The room was clean, and spacious, the beds were comfortable and we were lucky enough to be…"
 February 2019,5,Service,"The time I spent at allegro was absolutely amazing. The service was the best. Especially from an intern named Abdullah oudiouane. Faster than lightning he would offer us drinks or clean our table. Next to that he always wears a big smile on his face! Great food, friendly staff and a beautiful pool and private beach. I would recommend this hotel 100%."
 February 2019,5,Excellent Hotel,Me and my family stayed here for a week absolutley amazing staff the food was excellent and was cooked to a high standard really good variety. Yassine mohamed service towards us was brilliant he always made us feel welcome the canteen manager was brilliant did everything to make us feel at home. The rooms are a good size and are kept clean. Generally its a nice place close to the beach. The swimming pools are nice too. I was pleased i cant really complain its good hotel for the price we paid durings kids school holiday. Hotel is good and has kids activities staff are kind and helpful.
 January 2019,1,Worst hotel ever,"As soon as I saw the room allocated to us I had serious concerns, dirty unusable bath, lumpy pillows and mattress. Horrible food, I'm vegan literally all I could eat was vegetables and salad, culmination was that on day 4 became unwell which as I had head neck and shoulder pain was related to the bed turns out I had contracted meningitis; streptococcus and Hepatitis A, if you appreciate your health steer clear, after managing to get back to the UK I've been in hospital for nearly 2 weeks . I almost died and am not out of the woods yet"
 February 2019,1,"Clean, But Dated","We Finally arrived at Allegro even though we was taken to a different hotel, checked in Hand band on etc to find that wasn't our hotel. Apparently some hotels change there name quite frequent. So first impressions were ok apart from the Staff on reception, they were very ignorant and rude. We was given our room card and taken there. Although the rooms are dated they are clean. We stayed 7 nights and never had our sheets changed at all. The room always smelt damp. Bath towels we had 2 on the first day, then every day they only left us 1, I rang up and had to wait 2 hours before it came. Food was very nice although not a lot of variety but always something nice to eat. The pool was freezing but nice to sit around as it was a sun spot. The staff around the pool and pool bar were…"
 December 2018,1,Nice hotel.. horrible staff and owner.. worst customer service experience,Me and 5 friends went to visit agadir as we thought we owed ourselfes to some winter sun.. as soon as we got to the reception they told us to fill out some forms.. we were waiting a while to get seen as there was only one chap on the desk..there were 6 forms to fill but only one pen which took us a good 40 minutes to fill in total.. the staff are absolutely horrible and treat you like garbage.. when ordering drinks they just made any mix and gave it to us even though we asked for no alcohol and didn't even listen to us but demanded that we say please to them which was fair but their attitude stank!.. at the pizza bar we ordered a few pizzas and they gave the pizza to other guests and when we asked that this was for us they just said I don't know and made us wait another 20…
 February 2019,4,Pleasantly surprised,"Just returned from a glorious week in Morocco, weather lovely. Hotel was a lot better than we were expecting, after reading reviews. Staff all friendly and pleasant. Rooms basic ours needed Abit of TLC, but clean. beds really comfortable, maids daily. Food was typical all inclusive, breakfast was Abit odd some days ( turkey stir-fry) Pizzas around pool bar was lovely. Drinks were small but very good. Animation team friendly and as the time of year ( more older guests) worked hard to please everyone. Handy location for beachfront lovely walk. Would we stay again YES We would"
 February 2019,5,Lovely Hotel,"We are now on day four of our stay at The Hotel Allegro. So far it’s been brilliant, we have been made very welcome by all staff, the reception staff were very helpful upgrading us to a family room from a double (there are three of us) an error on our English agents part, they did this willingly and promptly. The food is delicious lots of tagines and local veg etc at the dining area or pizza and chips at the snack bar so all tastes are catered for. The standard of hygiene is very good and we have had beautifully laid tables at every meal with not a crumb in site! The drinks are certainly not watered down in my experience and they use real tonic water which is a bonus. There is lots to do and the animation team are fantastic. So far we’ve learnt to dance, cook have attended…"
 February 2019,1,MONEY STOLEN!!!,"There are a list of reasons as to why I would not recommend this hotel. Allegro Hotel is hands down the worst hotel I have stayed at. I’m not the type of person to leave reviews, whether it’s a good or bad review.. but this time I just had to. We were the last to get out of the transfer van at the hotel. The driver took our luggage out of the van except our baby bag that was with our luggage. I didn’t notice at that time until all the bags were brought into the hotel. When I realised the driver had gone. I asked the hotel rep to call the driver to check he has the bag and to drop it off, at this point my baby needed a nappy change and I was told by the driver in a rude way that I would have to wait a minimum 2 hours for my bag to be dropped off. The hotel rep sorted this for…"
 January 2019,5,Amazing week away,"Just come back after a weeks stay in this hotel with a friend of mine . All i can stay is it we had a amazing time, the food was great, lovely staff, very clean. 5 mins walk to the beach . we did a few tours, one around Agadir and we also did a massage, we enjoyed both tours. All in all it was a really nice hotel . 10 out of 10 thank you for a lovely holiday"
 January 2019,5,Great location,"I am a regular guests at this hotel. It’s situated in a perfect location and is within good walking distance to restaurants, bars, shops etc This hotel also has a brilliant animation team “Bravo” who work extremely hard with both adults and children. They provide entertainment every night including shows and do their best to get everyone involved."
 February 2019,4,Great hotel and staff,"Paid very little for this break and didn't expect to much. Was surprised at how nice the hotel was and how attentive the staff were. Rooms are small and dated and definitely not 4* quality however didn't bother us after grabbing a bargain. The food was very good, possibly not for fussy eaters but we enjoyed every meal and the pizza around the pool was quality. We fit back last night and we have already booked to go back."
 January 2019,5,Great vacation in a great hotel,"Good location, not far to the beach . Rooms were clean with very comfy beds. the food was well made and delicious - lunch and dinner had different meat , fish and vegetables. the pool area was clean and the sun beds were in very good condition,"
 January 2019,5,Best location ever! Value for money!!,"Good time with lads caused a lot of noise bless the staff for putting up with us. Location is perfect beach, bars, clubs and restuarant stone throw away. No point complaining about anything I stayed at a 5* for 2 days and joined the rest of the group at allegro have to say had way more fun at allegro"
 January 2019,5,LOVED IT,We came sat 12th January for 3 night's. We absolutely loved it. All staff were so polite couldnt fault any of them. There wasnt lots of choice of food but wow we were never disappointed it was delicious we definitely prefer quality over quantity. We are definitely coming back next year and bringing more people with us.
 January 2019,1,Mr,"The worst hotel I've ever stayed in . Restaurant table and chairs were never wiped once it's been used. Always grains and crumbs of food on chairs and table. The bedsheets don't get changed regularly. The rooms don't get cleaned property. The reception staff were not familiar with customer service. I informed the reception that I experienced lots of noise as I had the room directly below the lobby bar and was also having problem opening the safe after resetting it on the first day. I had to see a manger to change our room as the lady in reception informed me, first , that the hotel was fully occupied and then I had to pay to move rooms. A"" technician "" came round in the evening after I had moved to another floor. I escorted him when he opened the safe as I had passports…"
 November 2018,3,nice stay,"the hotel is situated in a nice location not far to the beach,shops and restaurants. This hotel could be a little gem with a bit of an update as it does look very tired, however it was clean. Staff here was great, friendly and welcoming. for us personally the biggest let down was the choice of food, what was there was nice though just not enough options. would we stay here again? yes"
 December 2018,4,From Winter To the Perfect Summer,"Now it became a habit of us (me and my partner) to go to a nice and warm country from the cold and grey winter of England. This time we choose Morocco, and the Les Almohades Beach Resort in Agadir. The trip was special, since apparently this was our last ""just me and you"" excursion with my partner, since we are expecting a little boy, a baby in March. It was planned as a relaxing, mostly chilling out trip, and a major vitamin D cure. Just very briefly, I, we got exactly what we wanted, and it became one of my best stay ever. Perfect timing (no high season), not too overcrowded hotel, excellent location (hotel is very close to the stunning beach of Agadir), very friendly staff at the pool bar and the restaurant, and outstanding kitchen, high variety of foods. Hotel is very…"
 November 2018,5,Pleasantly surprised,"Was nervous due to the other reviews however was a lovely place to stay. The food was delicious- don’t be scared to try things. Lots of choice (I don’t eat a lot of meat) but all the vegetable dishes were great. The staff were friendly. The rooms could do with an update but everything worked as it should. Fresh towels daily and bedding was clean. Animation team were excellent and nightly entertainment in the bar. I went all inclusive and there was snacks all the time - mainly fresh cooked pizza and chips, and pastries. The people who moan on here obviously expect English crap food for lunch and dinner, well it’s all Moroccan food, sometimes cooked in tagines. Just remember the star ratings are not the same as European ratings however I would love to stay here again. I…"
 December 2018,5,Amazing Hotel and Staff,"This hotel is the best we have had such an amazing time from start to finish. The staff are so professional and friendly. Entertainment team are fantastic. Abdel and Yas are so talented and great around the pool and in the evening. Bnacre the lad on the lobby bar and disco is the best bar man. Super friendly and very professional. He makes you feel welcome and made the experience a 10 out of 10. Food - massive variety throughout the week from Tagines, fresh seafood, chicken, steak, salads and amazing soups. Drinks - plenty of choice and great quality with a choice of freshly made mojitos, beers and spirits. Will definitely be coming back. Rooms are all to a great standard with a poweful hot shower."
 October 2018,5,50th birthday,"I travelled here in October to celebrate my 50th birthday for 2 weeks with friends. I was not disappointed! I was apprehensive due to other reviews. From checking in to checking out I cannot fault any member of staff. I was treated the way I treat people, friendly and with respect. My room was fantastic, cleaned daily, great air con. Food was fabulous, plenty to choose from, fresh and tasty. Drinks were great and plentiful, according to my hangovers. No problem with cups or glasses. Animation team were ok if that’s your thing, they are friendly enough and polite enough if they like you or your group. I have read they flirt with customers but from what I saw it was customers who were doing the flirting, practically throwing themselves at the boys. Made some great friends with…"
 November 2018,5,Ignore Disgruntled Reviews,"Not long returned from a 10 night all inclusive stay at this Hotel and can honestly say it was worth every penny payed.We found all staff to be friendly and generally hard working. Rooms-stayed in room 232,plenty big enough for two,maid service daily that did the basics and no fussing,flat screen t.v bbc world news ,mini fridge,nice hot shower and has hair dryer too,nice bacony over looking a well maintained secluded garden,with views towards the sea,found the bed to be comfortable although my partner felt her matress a bit soft but not a problem. Meals-Generally speaking we found all meal times offered plenty of choice for everyone,If you are prepared to try something new and different to chips then you are on to a winner,Absolutely loved the tagines on offer,well cooked and…"
 November 2018,1,Shambles.,"There is no wifi which is a bugger especially ground floor. The young woman at reception was rude and also she charged me too much for city tax and didnt give me a receipt and when i refused too pay the security guard decided to lock the doors, it was very very scary plus agadir is very lawless. Food was good but after few days u end up wanting to eat out ad it gets boring being at hotel all time. Rooms are ok try to get pool view as i had no wi fi and it spoiled my trip as well as the rest.i wouldnt return to this hotel especially after the behaviour of the staff. They are desperate for money."
 November 2018,1,Animation team excellent,I have just been to this hotel I would just like to make on thing clear the animation team is excellent and the bar staff is excellent but the rest of the hotel stag are poor at best the room we had was damp and to children bed for two men thay say they change them never did the reception was just not bothered about the guests I fell sorry for the animation team
 November 2018,1,AWFUL HOTEL!,"We arrived just before dinner in the evening and found our balcony door wouldn’t lock, after attempting to phone reception on the crackly phone we went up and tried to find a maintenance man, he arrived 40 minutes later so we had to rush our tea. We went on the “paradise valley” excursion which wasn’t explained well enough and we was mislead, we had to walk roughly 5 miles to get to the pool which was not covered by the sun and was difficult to assess for small children and elderly due to the rock climbing etc. My partner basically eats anything and he said the food had a poor choice, a lot of fish. I eat very little meat and I had to eat out most days as the food was very limited. The staff don’t want to be there, one of them admitted this too us, waiters are lazy,…"
 October 2018,3,A nice place but needs improving,"I stayed here with my Husband, 3 children and my Mother. The hotel is lovely in itself. Helpful staff, lovely pools. The rooms are basic but suitable for everyone. However our fridge hadn’t been cleaned out and neither had my Mums in her room. The cleaning staff came round any time from 8am. Be aware that they knock and just walk in so please pop your do not disturb sign on the door if you’re not ready. They only cleaned the floors. Our bed sheets weren’t changed all week. The bin was emptied in the bathroom and the sink given a quick wipe but we had to clean the bath etc. Towels are minimal. We had 4 people in our room and were only given 2 hand and 2 bath towels. They were often changed around tea time or merely folded up and placed on the shelf above the bath dirty. The…"
 August 2018,4,Family Holiday,"Me, my partner and our two kids stayed at Les Almohades/Allegro Agadir in August for our first stay in Morocco. Overall, the hotel was pretty good. Friendly helpful staff, good service. Rooms were nice and clean with very comfy beds, and the maids came around every day to clean the room and change bedding. Me and my partner enjoyed the hot buffet-style food at meal times. Lunch and evening meals had mostly different meat, fish and vegetables. The kids weren't very keen on that, but luckily the snack bar by the pool served pizza and chips during the day. The desserts were amazing and always a lot of different cakes on offer. Breakfast was a bit disappointing some days, but other days they had a chef making omelettes or pancakes to order. Alcoholic drinks: Beer was quite nice, but…"
 October 2018,5,Ignore bad reviews!! 5* service in a 4* quality hotel,"As this was our first visit to Morocco and also after reading some of the reviews about this hotel, we were weary about our stay but could not have been more surprised. The hotel is spacious and modern with a resort layout. 1 restaurant with a wide variety of continental food (we never went hungry!!) and friendly staff who are always helpful and bring drinks to your table. The hotel also has 2 large pools and a kids pool. There is music of a day and plenty of activities to keep you entertained. We played table tennis and French boules with other hotel guests, most of which were French but apart from the language barrier everybody was friendly and in holiday spirits! Our hotel room was very clean, we didn't have any issues other than the bathroom was slightly dated but the…"
 November 2018,4,Wrong name,"Now called les Almohades beach resort. Liked the pictures before the redecorating. Our thoughts were every where s bit tired the upholstery in the main reception in grey to hide the dirt. Light fitting in our bed broken. Only one chair on the balcony despite many promises of another one. Spent two hours on arrival trying to get into a room that the engineer couldn’t get into either as the electronic door wouldn’t work. Glad not there at height of season otherwise getting to sit down would have been a problem. Food was good. Sometimes a bit strange. Shepherds pie , mash tomatoe cheese!! Drinks not bad got two each time as small. Good gin and tonic. Shower over bath difficult to use as the head could only be hand held as didn’t fit the wall properly. On the positive lost my…"
 November 2018,3,This hotel seems to have had some updating but not necessarily in the right area s,"We quite enjoyed the hotel, it had some problems but not enough to spoil the holiday. Positives are the food was great, it was a good position to walk the promenade, the staff were friendly, the drinks were good. Negatives are that although the hotel has been updated by the pictures shown above maybe some of the money could have been spent on the rooms, the music at the pool was quite noisy, the drinks small (just order two), the WiFi basic and available only in a couple of places and then patchy. Thought the holiday was going to be one of those from hell when at midnight the door key wouldn't work first night, the hotel solved it fairly quickly by giving us another room. The animation team worked hard but not really our bag but lots of people enjoyed it. Enjoyed the…"
 October 2018,3,October 2018 - Interesting stay!,"This was our first visit to Morocco but we have visited Tunisia and Egypt previously. For those having visited those locations the climate, local areas and standards are similar. We chose this holiday because of the great deal Travelzoo offered and although trip advisor had very mixed ratings we decided to take the plunge. The hotel itself is dated as are most of the hotels we saw. The reception area is open and disorganized with you queuing to book in and after getting your all inclusive band, you then leave Reception to complete a more in-depth form ( like at the airport). Then you queue again to hand that in and given a room key (electronic). You then have the pleasure of queuing in another line at the reception desk to pay the tourist tax. Once this challenge is completed…"
 September 2018,5,Les almohades Agadir,"Our family had a lovely 10 nights in this hotel.Good location,excellent Moroccan food, lovely and helpful staff. We used On the Beach to book our holiday. In the hotel we met FOUAD. He is absolutely amazing very helpful knows his stuff and brilliant host. We’ve never felt so welcome. This guy merits 10 stars."
 October 2018,4,Good for a relaxing stay,We really Enjoyed it here. Food ok not really much choice never too busy which was good. Always a sun bed too. Room basic but ok. Shower curtain kept falling down. Beds comfortable. We were only here a week the beds were not changed. Also towels would be taken in the morning and often would not be replaced til 5/6 pm which was a bit annoying. Opposite the hotel is a nice restaurant and if you walk around there a a few shops. Weather was pretty good although did have one day of torrential rain !! All in all this is a nice basic all inclusive hotel and we enjoyed it.
 June 2018,4,It was good for the price cant complain too much.,Nice food nice hotel and nice location but not wow. Same food all the time got bored after few days even though it was tasty nice staff but the animation team are a bit too much and do not understand their boundaries and very pervey always trying to sleep with the guests that is the only down fall. If you dont want to pay much but still go there but if you are single females do not go there you will be disgusted by these little animations boys behaviours. Defiantly book lots of excursions to keep you busy but not through the hotel book it through little travel agents you have near the hotel. Take a walk look arou d before you book anything with anyone so you dont get charged too much. Just to let you know I did enjoy agadir it was great fun and relaxing. Me and my friend had a…
 September 2018,4,good hotel cant fault it,"arrived late in the evening by the time we checked in we had missed dinner which was fine as i always enjoy a first night walk to get my bearings . we got fruit, cold meat and bread delivery to the room by the hotel which was a nice touch. i didnt eat it but it was still a nice touch hotel-- the hotel was clean and tidy and the animation team worked long and hard to keep the guests occupied. everything from aqua dances to ballroom dancing.. the hotel is also right on the beach front so you are less than 2mins from resturants and bars rooms again clean and tidy beds were comfy also had 1 english speaking channel on the tv which showed 24/7 food not too my taste but the food was well made and looked clean but sadly not for me which is more my fault than the hotels, i do…"
 September 2018,2,Hotel poor. Food good,Just got back from a week here with my husband. We arrived at the hotel around noon queued at reception to sign in .... then was told to queue to get the bands where we also had to pay the taxes fee.... we stood waiting for the key but was told we wasn't allowed it until 3pm. Went back at 3pm only for everyone to be queuing again So spent the 1st 3.5 hours sitting waiting to get in the room the room was ok no shower curtain.... 3 times asking then finally got one. The toilet seat was not attached to the toilet .... wasnt fixed. The beds where on 2 levels . Had to go to reception twice to request towels. You will notice that the hotel collect towels from your room in the morning and you don’t get clean ones till around 6 which I find ridiculous . The maids where not great…
 September 2018,5,Fantastic holiday,"Please do not believe the bad reviews, I’m not sure they even stayed at the same hotel. From the minute we got there we were made to feel welcome. It’s a lively lovely clean hotel , delicious food and and snacks and you eat and drink all incisive from 7 am tilll 1am . The location is fantastic everything is on the door step beach , less than 5 minuets away, with fabulous restaurants on the way . We all loved it so much , we have booked to go back in September."
 October 2018,5,Rubbish bad previous Reviews,"We arrived as a family group late in the evening due to flight issues. The meals had finished in the restaurant and bar service about to close however, after checking in and taken to our rooms we found there was fresh food plated in the room consisting of sandwiches 🥪 fruit 🍇 etc, and the disco 💃 bar is open until 1am for a drink 🥃. I didn’t see any previous mentions of the city Tax’s you have to pay 💰 at a cost of around £8 per person! We all had a great time here. With good food served 🥘 throughout, drinks are the typical all inclusive type. Yes you get plastic cups at the pool area, which is common, but inside the lobby area it’s glass. I don’t understand the bad comments about the staff, as we found them all very polite and helpful. The pools are quite warm with lots…"
 September 2018,4,Really nice hotel,"Cannot fault this hotel, spotlessly clean, friendly staff, great animation team, caters for all European nationals, good mix of British, French, Polish, Russian guests. Food is very good, mixture of various meats/fish/vegetables each day and if you want chips and sausages then stay in England for your holiday or go to Benidorm. Agadir is a holiday resort which accepts and embraces multi cultures and you feel safe and welcome. Room is pretty basic but all you need (you don't spend all your holiday in your room do you?), we had a nice room overlooking the spotless gardens and pool with a massive balcony. Overall a very enjoyable and relaxing holiday. Ignore the rude comments, if you are kind and polite then you tend to find people are kind and polite back to you! If you…"
 September 2018,4,Don’t believe the bad reviews,"We just returned from a one week holiday, not one complaint about the hotel, our room was meant to be ready at 3pm but was ready by 1pm, nice room very big beds comfortable, food is hit and miss but depends if you’re picky or not, we never went hungry, I’d say the worst night for food is “Moroccan night” because it’s chick peas and veg but we just had chicken and this nice bread. Breakfast was lovely I had pancakes, omelette which is cooked right infront of you, lovely breakfast pastries and yogurt. Drinks can be frustrating because the cups are really small so two gulps and it’s gone, don’t read the reviews about water I have no idea why people say they struggled to get water there’s water everywhere - jugs at the bar to help yourself, machines in the kitchen and bottles…"
 September 2018,4,Very good time in agadir,Was a good hotel. Basic rooms but clean. Good mix of people. Very much a European friendly hotel. Always events going on. The staff do try thier best. Can't complain. Lots to do around the town. If you like to roll out !
 September 2018,4,Great hotel but food a little disappointing,"Just got back and have to say we had a wonderful time here the hotel is in a great location and what you expect from a 4 star in Morocco ! The staff were great and friendly but our room seemed to take forever to get cleaned! In saying that there was always clean towels and sheets , so can’t complain. The beach was beautiful and lots to see with camel rides henna tattoo and scarf sellers all on the beach. The only down side was the food good a little boring as there didn’t seem to be much choice unless you like rabbit, still there is other wonderful places to eat nearby! A lovely place to stay and enjoy !"
 August 2018,4,had a great time here.,"stayed here the last week in august. arrived at 12 noon to be told our room would not be ready until 3pm ( we knew this anyway from previous reviews ) we were given our wrist bands and told to go and get some food and drink and chill out for a while so far so good. went back to reception at 3pm and sure enough the room was ready. the porter got our cases and told us to follow him, bearing in mind this lovely guy was over 60 yrs of age we had a hard job to keep up with him, he showed where the lifts were and all the shortcuts etc. now to the room, nothing like the pics on website ( but are they ever ) but perfectly clean with great views over the pool, promenade, and hills so happy with that, ( room 346 ) unpacked and strait down the the pool area, lovely pool with a separate…"
 September 2018,3,Average visit,"I spent a week here the hotel has many qualities however many falls, The food was good however was quite repetitive,They make everyone feel welcome and the staff work hard, in particular the manager tall bald headed young man works extremely hard darting about the place trying to orde His staff and what not, however the bar was understaffed closes at 23:00? What about those who arrive late ?, the wif was poor and kept cutting out you’d think a 4 star hotel would have a better service, there was lack of entertainment e.g. tv in bar in lobby or in bar, however there was a bravo team ? Which were quite talented, the guy Alex ? Main performer? Someone give the guy a chance In a west end play his talents are wasted here, the maids cleaned and did what they would normally do however…"
 September 2018,5,Jumbo Tours,"We had the pleasure of having Fouad as our holiday rep during our holiday in Agadir. Fouad was amazing and really took the time to make sure we were looked after. We bought our excersion with Fouad and were not disappointed with his recommendations. I really recommend Fouad as he put as at ease from the get go. Thank you Fouad. Though Fouad was amazing... I was disappointed with the hotel Les almohades beach resort.. they have advertised themselves as having wifi, sauna and massage rooms, however this is not true at all, the only place you have access to WiFi is in the lobby and even then the signal is rubbish. Hotel staff and management are not helpful or friendly, in fact they are rude. Whilst I don't recommend the hotel, Fouad is definitely someone you should seek out to…"
 August 2018,1,NOT WORTH A VISIT,"Stayed at this hotel in August this year my wife two daughters 13 and 15 arrived at the hotel at 10 pm at night to a very disorganised reception after an hour we finally got our rooms reception staff rude unhelpful unable to get any food as all restaurant closed promised food would be brought to the room no food arrived, had to go out of complex at 11 pm to a local restaurant at a cost of £100 not a great start room in poor decorative order no lights in room curtains hanging down no acc no fridge complained and most things sought next day However Just getting ready to go to dinner and the TV CATCHES FIRE call reception rude receptionist laughs and hangs up left to carry burning tv out on to balcony Room is full toxic smoke Move rooms New room no lights but fixed to…"
 September 2018,2,Wouldn't say it was 4 star ..,"Me and my partner stayed here and there is a good atmosphere and friendly staff, its clean and tidy but the longer you stay you start to realise its not as great as you first thought . As time went on we started to realise drinks are really watered down , everything on the menu has fish in it and wasn't very big at all but what there is of it is lovely . The french people staying in the hotel were very rude and made my stay unpleasant . On the first full day we came back to our room to find half the bottle of our vodka we had on the side had been removed from our room which isn't a big deal its the principle of being able to leave stuff in your room without it being stolen or touched . Spoke to a manager nothing else was ever said or done about this and nobody ever came back to…"
 September 2018,3,Pleasant,"It was a good hotel overall ! There was semi old man who took us to our room, he was rude and unhelpful the very first night. He was throwing the bags around to the point I had to ask him to stop and give me my bag. They speak French in the hotel so hard to communicate with them. They dont have wifi in the rooms and majority of the hotel, except in the lobby, as you can imagine everyone is in there which means very slowwwww internet! the pool is very small for the amount of people in the hotel. if you want a peaceful visti, dont pick this hotel. There is constant loud music . They dont change the bedsheets unless you ask them, they just redo it, which is nasty. However they do clean the room, as its close to the beach the room can get messy!"
 September 2018,3,Not 4 star,"Just returned from 5 day visit to Morocco at les Almohades resort , first impressions the pool area is lovely very clean , the gardens were immaculate the main building itself was very tired furnishings need updating furniture needs attention scratched and in need of a little tlc , the club reps were fantastic always had some sort of activity going on and they were very hard working and friendly, the music which is played daily around the pool was not only loud but the content was very inappropriate for the ears of little ones , the food on the whole was good always found something to eat though English people are treated very much as second class always the last to be served with wine at dinner and practically had to beg for more than one bottle of water which was unacceptable…"
 September 2018,5,Amazing holiday!,"We went to this hotel a bit apprehensive after reading some reviews but decided best to make our own judgement. We definately were not disappointed. Our check in was very quick and the reception staff very helpful. Lovely and clean hotel, bit basic but very comfortable. The morning cleaning ladies were lovely. Very helpful and polite. Then came the entertainment! These guys work so hard for you to have a fun filled holiday! Absolute stars! The food was great too. Lots of choice and lots of Moroccan dishes each day. No complaints what so ever! Hope to go next year!"
 June 2018,3,nice stay,"good hotel not brilliant but more than adequate,great restaurant with loads of choice ,great staff,more like a 5 star,.food cooked fresh in front of you,not hurried,relaxed and most enjoyable,hotel staff excellent,animation staff hard working and sometimes annoyingly so,ha,rooms clean and tidy with regular bed linen changes and towels fresh daily,smaLL Pproblems are,not enough sunbeds ,we went early season so may change as it gets into high season,certainly not enough parasols,i counted 30,way too short,weather was very hot so needed them,private beach is a bit barren with no real service,music around pool,far too loud im afraid,couldnt hold a conversation without shouting,lovely grounds,we had a pool view room which got plenty sunlight and was nice n peaceful ,bar not big…"
 September 2018,5,Best family ever,"Just got back from a fantastic week- started off with jumbo tours (booked through on the beach) taxi service from the airport being so efficient and only taking 25mins to get to the hotel, then to be greeted at reception by the friendliest of staff who then helped us to our rooms with the bags. Check in is after 3pm but there’s a place to put your bags. Rooms were clean and well maintained, a few areas could be inproved but they did not effect our stay! The food is brilliant with such a wide range being provided through each meal time and a snack bar which is open when the resturant isn’t which serves chips and homemade pizzas! Then onto the bravo animation time, they deserve all the praise for our stay here along with the bar staff they are amazing, so so friendly and always…"
 September 2018,3,Good but could have been fantastic,"Just got back today after 2 weeks at Les Almohades all inclusive. Let's start with the bad stuff - got there around midnight and were put in a room that was poor and dirty although the guy on reception said we could move the next day if we didn't like it. We moved into another room the next morning which was marginally better - still very scruffy inside though. Within an hour the electrics had failed so we had to wait in for someone to come up (who was obviously working on Moroccan time). Having had the repairs done we went out only to find later that the door mechanism had failed and we were locked out of our room, which was only resolved by one of the staff going next door, climbing over the balcony and breaking in through the patio doors! The next room they gave us was a…"
 September 2018,4,"Great place, lovely staff","After reading the reviews on here, l was dreading this holiday but it was actually really nice! The food was good, plenty of variety, always fruit, salad & bread/soup. The staff were lovely, never had a problem with ordering drinks, the hotel itself is rough round the edges but you expect that from a 321 room hotel in that country. Overall great holiday."
 September 2018,5,Fantastic holiday! Very friendly!!!,"I read some of the reviews on here running up to our trip and was very worried about all negative reviews, however ........ Myself & my partner have just returned home after 10 days, we cannot fault this hotel especially for the price paid! The rooms could have been better however, they were always kept clean, new towels every day and beds always made! All we did is sleep there so didn’t need anything more! The whole hotel and pool area was always kept clean, within minutes of any mess they were there cleaning up! The bar staff were fab - my partner loves his beer and was constantly back and forth, they were always polite and up for a laugh and never once complained about the mount he drank 😂! The staff in the restaurant work there butts off and I can imagine it’s not for…"
 September 2018,4,ENJOYABLE BREAK IN THE SUN,"Just returned from a 7 day stay at Les Almohades and after reading some reviews I was wondering what we had let ourselves in for. All I can say is that if you want 5* rooms and food then don't book a holiday in Morocco because you wont get it, no matter how much you pay!!! Both my husband and I had a really good time. We arrived at about 12:30 and were shown straight away to our room, which had twin beds so we asked if we could have a double bed room instead, which they obliged and took us straight away to a different room which was clean, tidy, good working shower/bathroom and had working aircon. Food - always something to eat no matter how fussy, some days I just had bread and jam or yoghurt, omelettes are very nice, just ask for it well done otherwise it will be a little…"
 September 2018,3,Not a 4*,"Hi just returned from a week in this hotel. It is definitely not a 4* hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location, but is very dated you don't get your room till 3pm and the queue is long, you pay your local tax on arrival and receive you all inclusive band lunch and drinks available straight away, The bedroom is dated my bed had stains on the sheets so told reception and they changed them ( in my view they needed bining!!. We didn't have a problem with towels in room. The shower is a joke you have to hold it and try and wash yourself as holder did not move. First shower I near flooded bath room and had to start mopping up as floor was wet through. Fridge was full of water and leaked all over the floor, this should have been checked and emptied by staff. The drinks…"
 January 2018,4,perfect location,"The best place to stay in terms of location. restaurants bars pubs souk market beach marina... all around! the hotel is good ...we stay for new year the issue is ,they said at on the beach web site, that they have a heated pool what is not true. heated by the sun its not heated... specially in January.the other thing is ,they have a plastic cups to serve drinks at lobby bar, what can be better in glasses. coz it is inside the hotel glass will be much appropriate.and more tables outside the terrace too will be great. wi-fi not work very well but work better in some parts of the hotel. for the new year's eve they have no enough table for all people. So, we stay without table and wait longer to get one,some food was quite finished at that point. Normally the food are good every…"
 September 2018,5,good holiday and good trips,"Hi all,we had a lovely 10 nights in this hotel.Good location,good food,lovely staff...and trips was amazing. We use JUMBO TOURS where we met FOUAD who was really helpful and very lovely with us.He is absolutely amazing very busy,but always find time for us i just recomend this group for everyone.Everybody must to go for a quad😙😎😆"
 September 2018,5,Wonderful holiday and hotel,"Now, if your reading the negative reviews and are concerned then don't worry I was aswell, but if you've paid a relatively cheap price for this hotel like we did in comparison to some prices then it's up to you to make the most of it as we did. Firstly don't worry! The hotel itself, pool and grounds were great, they are constantly cleaning and maintaining the pool and grounds, 2nd, if there is an issue then tell them and they'll do all they can to rectify it, our room didn't have a shower curtain, no biggie we just put a hand towel down, I'm not going to mark down a hotel and the work that the staff do just because of a missing shower curtain. Rooms are fine, a little bit dated in places but they were fine for us, towels etc are replenished everyday and beds made. Food was…"
 September 2018,3,Our opinion,When we arrived we was late and missed last orders at the bar. We was asked to check in and pay the city tax for the week which was around £20 for the both of us. I asked to be brought a bottle of water and the waiter did after showing us to our room in the side block (the old block) he also brought us a plate each of fruit/ cheese/ bread etc as we had missed the meal times. Ok the room had a king size bed an appeared clean. We had a poor view which looked onto what we assumed was the staff quaters and also had a ladder up a small embankment which we seen people climbing up daily into the next doors garden. Also a big foot path which people walked down could see directly into our room. (167) the bathroom had a few problems and was dated. The toilet seat was hanging off on…
 September 2018,5,Absolute perfection,"After reading some reviews, I was hesitant to go to les almohades. It is right next to agadir beach and local amenities nearby. The staff spoke good English. They were prompt with any room queries I had such as using the safe. The staff always put 110% effort in especially the entertainment staff. The food was always good with a wide variety of choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The drinks were always served fast and the waiting staff were always happy to help. ***the only criticism about food is at the snack bar all they served was pizza and chips everyday*** The room was perfect. Big bed, air conditioning, nice balcony view. The cleaners were friendly. Although I'm not in a rush to go back to agadir, I'd definitely stay there again without a shadow of doubt."
 September 2018,5,Mr kingsnym,Excellent service specially jumbo mr Fouad has been extremely excellent on time very good prices I would definitely come back again because of the best service that’s been provided by Fouad High recommended
 August 2018,4,Nice stay at hotel and some good activities,"The hotel staff were very pleasant and very accommodating. We used Jumbo tours, and met a lovely Fouad. He explained to us everything and basically was our local guide and booked us in at reasonable rates for activities. After travelling quite abit to Morocco, one thing to note is you have to be transparent and clear at what you looking and want to do. Look forward to meeting you lot again :)"
 September 2018,4,Thoroughly a great holiday!,"We were so apprehensive about staying here after the bad reviews we read but we are so glad we did!! We arrived at around 11:30am where we met Faoud from Jumbo tours who was really really nice. He showed us a list of trips to consider and we decided to go with the harmam and argan oil massage and Fantasia. I think we paid around 1600 dirham for the two of us for both. You can probably get cheaper outside of the hotel but we wanted convenience more than anything. He was a gent and the two trips were great! Fantasia was awesome and they put so much effort with their entertainment! The massage was great too, though I was slightly shocked as us ladies had our massage and scrubs naked! The gents didn’t have to bare all. Check in time is 3pm so we just walked around for a bit and…"
 September 2018,5,Great waitress and hotel,"Asma Jalal, it was a pleasure to meet you and you were a fantastic waitress, very attentive and kind. Thank you again, Roger & Claire We also enjoyed our holiday at Les Almohades that we are going to return next year"
 September 2018,1,Worst run hotel,"Just got back from a week here with my partner. Where to start.. we landed at 11.30 and arrived at the hotel an hour later to be told our rooms were not ready till 3.. so after queuing to check in first to be told this was not good as all I wanted was a shower and change my clothes. We went for something to eat and a walk about till 3 then back to reception for our room only to be told (after another queue!) that room wasn’t ready again! So spent another hour and half in the lobby till room was ready.. the room was ok but blood on the floor, no towels, no ashtray on the balcony and only bin was in the bathroom. Had to go to reception twice to request towels. You will notice that the hotel collect towels from your room in the morning and you don’t get clean ones till around 6…"
 August 2018,3,Average holiday don't expect too much,"We stayed at les almohades beach resort they advertise as a 4star hotel, I know outside of European standards there is a different rating system this is more like a 2 star hotel. You pay for everything and you have to ask for everything! This a beach resort and you have to pay to get a beach towel, it's not £2or £5 it is £20 per towel,refunded when you return the towel (I'm used to it being booked to your room) our double pool view room (225) could just about see the one main pool with off shoots of shallower pools ( there is not 3 separate located pools) and the double bed was 2twins not attached together! I would however recommend the beach (didn't see a beach bar though)! At food times if you want water ask for it, you don't get a bottle in your room and if you forget at…"
 September 2018,2,What can I say,"I know the stars are different in the UK but there is no way this is 4 stars, when we got there had to check in at 3pm but the room was not ready till 4:30pm no reason was given. I always find something to eat but was hard at times so we went out to eat. The bars hahaha well the size of the hotel only had two bars, the staff was really nice but the kept running out of glasses and when you go one they was very small so you had to keep going back out after you had a mouthful. Most of the staff didn’t speak English and was mostly French. My room was just normal what was ok till I wanted a shower in the afternoon they took the towels in the morning and didn’t return them till lat afternoon what was strange. Would not go back or recommend but I did have a good time"
 August 2018,4,3 star hotel,"Hotel was not as dated as previous reviews state. Room are ok,just pot luck as some are nicer than others. Food is only 3 star at best but edible. Have time up early to get a sunbed. Animation team gets everyone invovled. When booking any trips don't book with the reps in the hotel as I discovered i got ripped off. Use local reps that are out and about. But paradise valley is a must. Overall better than expected after reading reviews."
 August 2018,5,Loved it!,"I hadn't done a lot of research prior to our visit to Agadir or this particular hotel if I am honest, It was my friend that told me about some of the poor reviews a few weeks before we went. This made me a bit apprehensive about the place. However, we arrived at the hotel and was aware of the later check in, which was fine. We gave our details, paid the city tax and went off for lunch. When we were taken to our room at around 3pm, it was not the room we had asked for which caused a bit of a fuss and the reception staff were not very helpful. As this was not the hotels fault, after heated discussions, we accepted what they told us and changed to another room, which we was happy with and then continued our holiday. Agadir in my opinion was quite small and varied with little to do…"
 August 2018,4,Honest Review taking everything into account.,"I wont lie i had mixed feelings about staying here because of such mixed reviews, upon arriving at 12.30pm we knew check in was 3pm and we'd have to wait which was fine, we was told to go and get some dinner no-one showed us where to go so my first thoughts were negative. Found the restaurant eventually and the food being served suited us perfectly, Lamb Chops, Chips, Veg, Pork, Fish, Cous Cous along with bread and a selection of cakes, fruit and biscuits. By the time we had eaten, had a look around the beach and hotel we were shown to our room. The room the hotel provided us and what we asked for were nothing alike, there was 3 of us, all adults and when we booked through Global Hoppers we were advised the standard room to fit 3 would be a twin with a fold out bed, we asked…"
 August 2018,2,Outdated hotel,Agadir is such a beautiful place to visit but this hotel is outdated and dirty. The beddings look like something you would find in a hostel and the bathroom is just nasty. The internet is slow and only available in the lobby. The pool side is decent but small. Don’t book jumbo tours for the city tour or other activities as they over charge for services you can find cheaper if you just leave the hotel. The city tour is a waste of time and an excuse to get their friends to rip you off. Don’t buy anything from The Ali baba shop as their prices are 5 times higher than at the Souk. Definitely visit the Marina it’s beautiful. Be vigilant as every other person is probably trying to rip you off.
 July 2018,3,Nice Hotel for the French,Stayed here for a week and while the hotel is very nice and clean and the pool and food was very good it is very much catered for the French ! The entertainment team didn’t want to know you unless you were French . I enjoyed my stay here but if I were to visit Morocco again which I doubt as I did not particularly like the country I would choose a different hotel . The beach is a 5 minute walk away but beware to be hassled constantly by peddlers and quite aggressively at times. there are sun loungers on the beach for hotel guests free of charge but we didn’t really bother as we were pestered too much .
 August 2018,3,Didn't like it.,Not enough sunbeds and even less umbrellas this hotel had 321 rooms and only 48 umbrellas. Had to get up at 7am everyday to get one The tiles on floor by the pool and dining room were worn and sticking up in places. Food was hit and miss it was very limited choice and repetitive. More often than not it was luke warm at best. Beach bit was a good walk away with no bar This hotel favours the french with food and entertainment as it was always spoken in French and the veg loaded with garlic. Barman was rude my husband got me a drink and when asked for one for himself the guy kept saying youve got a drink already. He didn't want to give him another The hotel was very loud throughout day into early hours of the morning sometimes with guests rowing. On departure day reception…
 August 2018,3,Honest family review!!,we got there at 12pm check in was meant to be 3pm ended up sat about till 5 still waiting!! This is the first and only hotel I’ve ever been to where you don’t get a room straight away with 2 children this isn’t good!! As we had been up since 2am with flying and so on!! Animation team!! Fantastic people very friendly even played with kids!! All staff were spot on apart from reception staff need to work on manners!! Entertaining or lack off it! We watched one show and it was in a stuffy room with no air con or drinks bar so was sat sweating to death!! Food!!! This is by all means the worst part of this hotel!!! There was around 10 trays off food and that’s it constantly fish chicken pork and veg!! Nothing for the kids!! Do not cater for kids at all!!!!!!!! They don’t cater for…
 August 2018,2,1 week in Agadir. Thanks but I won't be returning,I went with my 2 son's. One is a baby 1.5 year old. I cannot believe how much i struggled with my son out here and had no sort of help or assistance from staff. When arriving it was gone midnight. I was stood in reception for 30 mins due to large number of people checking in. I asked if i can be shown to my room to put my kids to sleep first and then complete paperwork following day. No chance. 2 days later I asked a lady at reception to speak to manager. Very rude. I asked her name she said it wasn't my business and suddenly she didn't speak English. Everyday i had to ask for a high chair and cutlery and water. When you are on your own with 2 kids and stood there everyday hoping someone helps you its sickening to be ignored. The animation team were nice and always said hello.…
 August 2018,4,ENJOYABLE,"You do get what you pay for and maybe a bit more,Good food and the animation team are always on hand to get you off your sunbed and get involved if you want too.Rooms are very basic in the block we were in.There are a lot nicer areas and rooms in other parts of the hotel but mainly the French were in the best rooms.JUMBO TOURS are conmen and will try to get as much money out of you as soon as you get to the hotel for tours etc.We booked Fantasia with them and cost nearly £200 for 4 adults one child.I wouldn’t go again even if it was free we were herded like cattle into a tent and put on a table with a family of four which made 9 of us round a small table and each table got the same amount of food to share wether 4 on a table or 9 like we were.Hence we were all hungry after the…"
 August 2018,4,Not for me,"First visit to Morocco and get mixed feelings ,first the hotel is clean and the staff are great fresh towels and bedding every day ,the food is good with a good variety to cater for everyone,supposedly two restaurants but only one in use so very busy ,pool ok but needs to be bigger,snack bar at pool ok pizza n chips n fruit ,bar at pool ok but need more glasses got served a beer in vending machine coffee cup several times a day,if you can speak French then you'll be looked after.Animation team work very hard to try and please everyone day and night .DO NOT book any trips with the jumbo tours rep Fouad I booked 3 trips with this man and did not get picked up for any until we spoke to hotel staff and they rang around to try and find Fouad and then he tried fobbing you of on a tour…"
 August 2017,1,So dissapointed,"After looking forward to this holiday for a year we were so disappointed. The two younger ladies on reception we so rude and treated us as an inconvenience rather than welcoming us with even a smile. We were told there was no record of our booking and told to sit down while they chatted amongst themselves, completely unrelated to our booking. Absolute shambles and a horrible start to our holiday. The food was ok to start with but after a few days it got very repetitive and we went out for the last four nights. The cleaners walked in at about 8am most mornings despite us being in bed and after 10 days the bedding wasn’t changed once, the towels were only changed when we asked. Air con wasn’t as you would think, just a very gentle fan rather than air con. The hotel was far too…"
 August 2018,5,Very nice!,"Hello, I had the pleasure to spend a week holiday this hotel and I must admit that everything was fine. Rooms clean, neat, cleaned and changed towels daily. Food in the restaurant outstanding, something new every day. In the main restaurant, we had the pleasure of meeting a waiter named Abdusalam. He deserves special praise because his commitment and openness to guests was above average. Staying in this hotel was very nice for us and we will definitely be back."
 August 2018,3,average average average,"hotel is a lot smaller than the impression i was given,said 3 pools but this is one swimming area split into 3 small pools,also was told 2 restaurants but only 1 and a snack bar.Biggest dissapointment was the beach devious pics i was shown make it look like you walk out of side of hotel onto the beach this isnt the case,you walk out onto a busy main road walk about 200 yards to this little section of their own private bit where there is no beach bar or even toilet facilities,like most people there visited once never went back.very small choice of food at mealtimes,but as a family we can be fussy but tbh the food is very good we always found something decent.rooms are ancient but clean would of been better if they at least put water in fridge everyday,Agadir as a town is pretty…"
 July 2018,3,"Rooms 2star, rest OK","The staff were mostly very nice and provided good customer service. The grounds are quite nice and the food was good though a little More choice might have been good particularly at breakfast. The pool was okay but loungers were hogged by towels and not people for a lot of the day. The rooms were awful, very disappointing and basic but kept clean. Box TVs! Nothing in minibar not even some water. Tiny grubby bathroom. Given towels for two when three to a room. We were given a twin room with a camp bed in, not a double With a sofa bed like advertised, but we had good views and made the most of it. I was most disappointed that i had an expensive bikini and some make up and we also had some phone headphones go missing/stolen from our room. This would put me off returning and we…"
 August 2018,2,Not good,First of all the hotel and staff are great the food is good with plenty of variety but the entertainment is all in French the music is all in French and all the language overall is French so unless you understand or speak French keep away from this hotel because you won't have a clue what is happening
 August 2018,2,Don’t Bother | Don’t understand the good reviews.,"-Firstly..this is obviously not a 4star. Like most African countries..more like a 3. -The food here is revolting. I’m open minded and eat most things but had to eat out every night. It is disgusting and not much choice. Can’t understand how people say the food is ok. One night all they had were rabbit or this revolting fish. - WIFI only works in reception or near pool bar. NO WIFI IN ROOM. Even then it doesn’t work if more than 3 are using it. - Pool area dirty and never much availability in the form of sun-loungers. - Adequate pool entertainment if that’s your thing. - Some friendly staff and some ignorant and arrogant. - Nothing to do around surrounding areas really apart from poor, mundane trips. Avoid Agadir, save your money and go somewhere else - (P.S. AVOID ‘English…"
 July 2018,4,Great hotel,"Don't know what all the negative reviews are for. We had a great time here, food was great, animation team are great, hotel was a little tired in places but overall superb and won't hesitate to return."
 June 2018,3,Atlas almohades hotel agadir,Stayed in this hotel in June 2018 with friends. Basic small room AC didn’t work toilet/bath door wouldn’t lock. Pillows were hard mattress very soft look like not been changed for years. Complained at the reception was told ask to change the room in the morning. Which we did room was changed with a pool view I understand all the rooms in this hotel are the same small size. In the evening in the pool area loud music started which could be heard in the room and goes on till 11.30pm some nights till 12am. Music was so loud one couldn’t sleep in the room. They have music hall but prefer pool area to play music. Music could be heard in the beach area. This hotel is not on the beach as claimed you have to cross dual carriageway to get to the beach not safe if you’re with children. …
 October 2017,4,Great resort,"This is a great resort to stay with family, great location, friendly, polite and helpful staff, good selection of local and continental food. Beautiful sea view. Reasonably priced, will recommend to try"
 August 2018,2,Research before booking this hotel,"I usually research and read reviews on hotels before booking. This one had good to average. The staff are helpful and polite but I have not seen a single member of the staff smiling, it felt I was on an outpatient department. The rooms are of a good size and clean but the hotel dose not meet the 4 STAR status it was given on so many platforms. 99% of the places we visit for holidays are Muslim countries so we can enjoy the fine weather and the tastey food and as a muslim myself not having to worry about non halal food. We booked an all enclusive stay at the resort, and the shock was that pork and bacon was served on an open buffet where guests were cross contaminating other food by using the same cutleries. So be careful"
 July 2018,4,Don’t understand the bad reviews ?!,I have to wonder if we went to the same hotel as it he one some people have negatively reviewed. Or perhaps they have reviewed the wrong one. Quite bizarre really. Then again t think a lot of people have far too high expectations or are just plain miserable gits. It’s a 4 star hotel in Morocco. We aren’t in Mayfair now darling. Jeez ! Firstly the only reason I have 4 not 5 was because we didn’t get the room we booked. We should have had a double room and a twin but ended up with 4 single beds in one room. Not quite what we had in mind but oh well. Nothing else was available so we had to make do. We don’t actually go on holiday to live in our rooms. It’s only somewhere to wash change and sleep. Having said that the room although basic was clean and comfortable. Cleaned every…
 July 2018,5,"Excellent location, outstanding entertainment team","Just returned from 1 weeks holiday here. Can honestly say I did not want to come home. Hotel clean and tidy, reception staff helpful when needed. Security staff friendly. Pool clean and large. Snack bar offers chips, pizza, melon, popcorn and donuts. Pool side bar even had slushies for kids or even adults with a little gin in lol. Rooms clean, not luxury but we only slept there. Food, a very good variety at all meals. Slit of fish, salad etc Location perfect. Beach over the road from hotel. Beaches are clean, sandy beaches. Sun beds free for hotel. Short walk along the beach front for mc Donald’s, Pizza Hut, kfc. We did jet skiiing which was just amazing and excellent price too. Camel rides in the hotel and there is a owl who gets brought in for photos. Last but not…"
 July 2018,4,Not where near as bad as the reviews!,"After reading the reviews posted over the last few months we were so worried out our stay and almost moved our holiday somewhere else, we were glad we didn't. We stayed in block B, yes the rooms are basic and we did have a few minor issues but these were sorted our room was tided and cleaned everyday and fresh towels provided. The room we were allocated was facing the pool which we thought was amazing until night time came, loud music from the snack bar untill 11pm, which is not normally a problem unless you have a 7 year old to try to get to sleep. The animation team were amazing and really went out of their way to make sure everyone had a good time, I can recommend the 'Aqua gym'. We didn't find one member of staff rude, they all tried their hardest to communicate in…"
 July 2018,3,Decent family resort,"My partner and i arrived on 19.07.18 and left on the 28.07.18. (9 days) On arrival the resort appeared clean and beautiful. The reception were welcoming and told us and other groups we had to wait 3 hours before check in. After sitting in the lobby with all our luggage 3 hours later we were told to wait another hour as the rooms were not yet ready. We were outraged, after 10 mins of trying to persuade various men in suits to take oir luggage and that we had waited long enough the guy who organises the excursions helped us get our keys to our rooms. Rooms tidy and clean. We had to single beds pushed together to make one large bed. Towards the end the cleaning or lack of was more apparant. Our bed was remade but with dirty sheets. The reps of the hotel were friendly and made…"
 July 2018,4,Ok Hotel for what you pay,"We where a little worried after reading the reviews before we arrived, but I can honestly say we where pleasantly surprised. The rooms are basic but very clean we have a view of the pool and beach which was lovely they were cleaned very day with fresh towels. Food was good always hot just needed a little more choice. Pool area was good apart from the pool manager looked like Peter Stringfella he said he was a tennis coach, found him rather rude and unhelpful. Now to the best part of the holiday was the young entertainment team, they where amazing, always happy always Working hard and put on some lovely shows, they are a credit to the Hotel, they made our stay so much better. We hope the hotel management appreciates how good they are “ Bravo team “ made our holiday and stay…"
 October 2017,5,Will be going back of sure,"We were a little apprehensive when we booked the holiday, however as soon as we arrived any negatives quickly disappeared. The reception staff were very friendly and were able to fulfil a request for a private balcony room on the top floor as we were celebrating our 25th Anniversary. The views from the balcony were stunning. Service from all staff was friendly and we had a change of team half way through our stay which led to some very interesting measures in the G&T and Whisky and Coke - no complaints though :-) Food was EXCELLENT, there were theme nights every night (spanish, italian, french, moroccan etc.) so a very good variety, Lunchtimes there was always a good variety of fresh salads and fruit to accompany everything else on offer. If you ask, they will bring a…"
 July 2018,5,Excellent Holiday,"This is a lovely hotel, staff all try very hard. There is a beautiful sea breeze often which helps keep the temperatures around 30C. Rooms are very clean and comfortable, the pool is warm and there is a lifeguard on duty everyday. The week we are here there is a huge mix of nationalities - we really like that but others might not. Speaking French is definitely an advantage but even my basic school girl French was appreciated. All meals are buffet style so variation is depending on what you choose with the addition of the nightly special dishes - we’ve loved the food everyday especially for me the barbecued fish. Deserts are along the lines of French patisseries and fruit but all so far have been delicious."
 July 2018,4,Beneee,Very very kind and nice people!!! Food is great! Drinks are ok. Rooms and the hotel are not in the best shape but alright...you dont doo your vacation in your room!!! Beach is 1 min away from the hotel. The event at the evenings are a bit loud but they usually dont go over midnight.
 July 2018,4,WHERE SAGA MEETS THE INBETWEENERS,We were given a room that involved walking up 3 flights of stairs. There was talk of a fabled secret Golden Lift but we never found it so ask at reception if you have mobility issues. The Beach was accessible by crossing a road and a concourse but you needed to swerve to avoid the Looky Looky sellers. It was like an eighties video game – a cross between Sonic the Hedgehog and Zombie Killers 3. Once ensconced in the cordoned area (they do respect this) you have a stunningly beautiful beach. At the Pool there was a loud mix of Rap and Tropical House interspersed with your favourite classics being murdered by K-TEL various artists. The animation team worked tirelessly with limited resources under the excellent stewardship of Mr Ferrari (not his real name but he did wear a F1 cap).…
 June 2018,2,very very poor better go somewhere els,"only one main bar, one restrunt, food no choise. dont even have proper glasses for drink like beeae or wine. never go again. only one pool, totally disappointment. staff relay not helpfull at all. no money exchange."
 July 2018,4,"good hotel,good location","I was pleasantly disappointed in the hotel. I read a lot of bad reviews.The hotel rooms and the bathrooms need to be refurbished,but the rooms were clean, every day were cleaned, every day we got a clean towels.The air conditioner worked well.All the stuff were helpful,polite.The food was fine and varied,(Moroccan spices!) but everybody found some food that was good for him.We got alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks all day.The beach is clean, the hotel has its own beach area.Summary: good value for money"
 June 2018,5,Lovely hotel & holiday,"To start of I want to say I don’t know what the fuss on here is about, yes the rooms were just standard and weren’t the cleanest however if you ask the cleaners they will do a good job. The hotel food is good, a bit repetitive but still good. The animation team were amazing! Every night they made sure we had a fantastic night and took care of us throughout our whole stay especially maya and Fatima, lovely girls. They do tend to speak a lot of French but English is also spoken so there’s nothing to worry about. I would recommend doing all the activities there is to offer such as quad biking and jet skiing. The massage and hamman was lovely aswell. Most important Tip is to never accept the first price always haggle them (anywhere you go in Agadir). Also don’t be afraid to go out…"
 July 2018,4,Good holiday,"Just got back from a 4 night stay with my friend and we were overall happy with this hotel. We arrived late and the restaurant was closed but was left food in our room which was a good touch. Check in was fairly slow and long winded , waited a while to be shown to our room but staff were friendly. Room was ok, needed a bit of tlc but was cleaned well and beds were comfy. WIFI was very hit and miss, some days would work well and the next rubbish. We found all staff to be very friendly and welcoming , couldn’t fault anyone. The animation team were brilliant , all were so friendly and fun and to be honest made our holiday as always got us involved in activities and up dancing at night. Food was excellent , could not fault. Always lots of choice and never the same stuff. Drinks were…"
 July 2018,4,Don’t believe all you read,"After reading the reviews of this hotel I was dreading my holiday. But after spending a week there I’m not actually sure these people went to the same hotel. The hotel rooms are a bit tired and in need of a bit of tlc but for the price you pay I really couldn’t grumble. We arrived late so decided to immerse ourselves in the local culture and hit the “disco” and after downing a few drinks managed to get to our feet and have a dance ( actually we were dragged up) music in there is defiantly for the younger generation although we did pay a visit a few times. Drinks flowed all day Long with no questions, the measures were more than generous and as long as you’re happy with the normal drinks like beer, vodka, whisky etc you won’t grumble. All the staff were great, helpful, polite…"
 June 2018,1,Joke of a hotel,"I think this hotel has got to be the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at. We booked all-inclusive, and I know the food you receive is generally hit and miss, but this hotel was just constant miss. It was awful. Most nights I never found anything to eat, and would go to McDonald’s/kfc just by the beach (nice friendly staff). Only one person in our group ate the food, but that’s because she would eat anything, and towards the end she stopped eating it because unlike us, who didn’t eat the food, she got the runs. The pool bar probably had the best food, but they treat you like kids. They serve you the food and only give you 2 slices of pizza, you try and ask for me, but the chef doesn’t actually understand. As a female on holiday, it’s pretty obvious that I will be wearing bikinis,…"
 July 2018,4,Not bad at all,I am currently coming to the end of my holiday and I thought I would leave the review before I left. On arrival we were welcomed by the reception staff and we advised to go for lunch whilst our room was available. Food has been lovely throughout so far and the area is being constantly cleaned by the staff. We were taken to our room straight after lunch and ok it's not cracking but it was clean and the beds are really comfy! The animation team and bar staff around the hotel are all friendly and accommodating and they work hard and do a fantastic job!! However there is one rude...arrogant horrible man and he is at the pool all the time (blonde hair) he blows his whistle constantly and is generally rude and arrogant to everyone...horrible man!! But overall this hotel isn't as…
 May 2018,3,It was actually OK,"My partner and I stayed here for a week in May. We had booked a private transfer from the airport and because of the late flight and upon arrival at reception we were quickly ushered to the dining area for food before they closed. which was very thoughtful. Our room wasn't so great, no air conditioning and no fridge! and i think they definitely need to refurbish. We did however complain about the fridge and one was replaced within hours. The cleaning staff were brilliant, couldn't fault them. the resort is made up of a lot of french tourists and having spoke to one or two of the (handful) English guests we quickly learnt that the best rooms are reserved for the French. We didnt go as far as demanding a room change because we don't really mind as long its clean. The entertainment…"
 June 2018,4,You get out of holiday what you put in,"We stayed for two fantastic weeks at this Hotel. Yes it is a bit tired and dated but very clean , all the staff from security reception,waiters ,bar staff and animation team were amazing... big thanks to Abdul and Fati on animation team made us smile every day .... thanks to Lhabib and mehdi the bar staff at the pool they were great .... food was lovely always a meat fish and a pasta on every meal and love trying bits of different Meals from tagines... as we were in Morocco.... going out wasn’t such a big deal just a polite hello and no thank you was enough to those who wanted to sell things. We went for walks almost every morning and had a few meals out at night .... lovely holiday thank you all at this hotel ..."
 July 2018,4,Very very good holiday,"I stayed here in the 28th of June till the 5th of June and I was worried because of the reviews but the reviews are lies!!! Stayed there for 7 nights and loved every second the rooms was fine nothing was broke but it didn’t matter to me as I’m not in holiday to sit in my room, the food was 3 star some nights 5 star but I’m a fussy eater. The hotel is in a great spot close to everything also there is a reatuarnt outside the back called el toro it is amazing 🥩!!! The pool is nice bar staff are nice and the animation team are the best if you go there ask for Issam he made our holiday perfect by making sure we was happy he was happy to play good music at the pool in the day time and night time in the club please make sure you speak to him but yes I’d go back so if your going to…"
 June 2018,4,Good hotel nice location,The food was lovely i used to be a five star chef and can say its ranks in the same quality. obviously not five star so the selection is not the same but you wouldn't go hungry .the waiting on staff at restaurant and the up staurs bar staff are lovley friendly and work very hard for there money .the animation team work long hours and are good pool side entertainment and they provide evening entertainment to the hotel also hostes its own beach which is a short walk from hotel but no bar on beach. Our room was 252 and was lovely and cleaned every day with put fail. So big thumbs up.the location is fabulous i recommend croco park and zoo i loved them . I highly recommend the hotel and i noticed lots of ramps aroud the complex so would be suitable for wheelchair or buggies .
 July 2018,3,Well..,"So before coming here, I read many bad reviews so was a little bit apprehensive about the visit. On arrival, we were made to pay a tax of 247mdh which was never mentioned on booking. We were then shown to our room, which had pistachio shells on the floor between the beds.. every body we spoke to had issues with the cleanliness of the rooms. The food, well there is a variety and it was okay, but be prepared to run to the toilet after! The staff - the animation team are amazing!!! They made our holiday. However the reception staff are rude as anything, having a go at guests and just generally unhelpful and now the bar staff, we had one gentleman who was brilliant, but everyone else questioned how many drinks we were getting (all inclusive and 4 of us I must add) and the response…"
 June 2018,2,..,"Reception staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. Do not forget your translator if you are from the UK otherwise you will be stood at the reception desk for a lengthy amount of time. All inclusive, well. The bar staff will question the quantity of drinks and who they are for and put drinks in the smallest disposable plastic cups. Good selection of food, although expect to be rushing to the toilet shortly after. Maids mop the floor from the front door to the balcony and the amount of dust and dirt in and around the room and outside of the rooms are horrific (I have attached some pictures of some plates, cups and a rubbish bag that was left close to our room for 4 days with a build up of ants & wasps). If the cleaners spent as much time working as the landscape gardeners then the…"
 July 2018,1,Don’t go here!!!,Came here for a ten night holiday. Spent about an hour in the reception area waiting for our room and just being walked past as if we wasn’t there. Then got told they had given our room to someone else!! Women on reception is unbelievable rude. Second day I came down with food poisoning and was in bed for two days . The the same happened wirh my partner. The place is not clean at all. Rooms are outdated and staff just walk into your room without knocking. We paid money and came back earlier as we couldn’t stand to be there any longer. Save your money and don’t come at all
 July 2018,4,worth all inclusive for food and drink,staff are pleasant and make an effort to make guests feel welcome. Rooms are outdated but food has a good choice and is mostly fresh. Considering the cost of the hotel in comparison with what I have had else where ( though first time in Morocco ) I think it is very good value. I don't rate the city tour by jumbo tours worth it as it's more an excuse to try and get you buy things from people they know. And all this take what you want and I will give you a good price is rubbish. No I want to know the cost!
 June 2018,3,Hot and bothered in Agidir.,"A weeks family holiday in Agidir, stayed at Les Almohades Beach Resort. Despite mixed reviews we chose this hotel as it was close to the beach (3-5min walk) . The hotel lobby was clean and welcoming, we all had to fill out  a 2nd landing  card and pay local  tax of (17MAD×7days per person). The receptionist offer us to pay in GBP but i refused and pay in MAD. We had requested a family suite for a family of 4 , we were shown to a big spacious room on the ground floor with 2 twin beds and 2 make shift  beds in another end of the room. I  went back to the reception  and informed that we booked a family room. I was told to stay in the room for the night and they would sort it in the morning. The following morning we discovered that the sink was unable to open-water was settling in…"
 June 2018,2,Very cheap and dirty,Hotel was cheap and dirty and really run down need so much work done to it. We made the most of it and made some good friend with did help our holiday. Defo wouldn't be back here and don't think to Morocco as well been twice now.
 June 2018,3,Not a 4* hotel,"I can't deny we got a good deal on this hotel and as we paid cheap and got cheap I can't really complain. But I think to call this 4 star would be a bit of a oversell. Staff: They are Ok, some rude and will constantly be on the phone or talking to colleagues while serving you, some will grace you with a smile and a little chat occasionally. I certainly don't think they were working for tips like some hotels I've been to. I went to one hotel where the staff were rewarded based on their feedback on TripAdvisor which worked out great for guests :) We liked the lady who cleaned our room but she did rock up between 8.15 and 9am every day, We might have liked just one lie in. Do not disturb signs would have been an easy win there. Excursions: Fouad gets a lot of mentions on here.…"
 June 2018,2,Not impressed & not a 4* in my own opinion.,"Upon arrival all seemed pleasant, despite the fact of being rushed into reception to attend a ‘welcome meeting’ before even being handed our room keys. This welcome meeting was a meeting to sell excursions with what seemed like very little patience from the tour guide ‘Fuoad’ it was kind of book on the spot and pay now with no time to think about it, nevertheless we continued with no concerns & as the week stay went on things just got worse. I encountered rude staff serving other customers who had just joined the queue, pervy staff a night time receptionist who started a conversation about ‘jiggy jiggy’ and asked if we like? The room and hotel was clean, i had no concerns with cleanliness although our room seemed a little outdated and when speaking with other hotel guests we had…"
 June 2018,1,Worst hotel in the world!!!,"Got there late evening, queued (first of many) to book in, there were probably about 10 of us looking to book in and the receptionists could not even run that smoothly!! Got showed to our room which was down several dingy corridors (even the young guy showing us to our room got lost and that’s not a joke!!) Walked into our room which stank of must, moth balls and sewage, to find no air con, 2 single beds wrapped in fleece brown 1970s blankets and a tv which was so old the remote control was on a wire!! Went back to reception were we was met by the tall slim smarmy rep, after some discussion we were moved to a room with a double bed and clean sheets (best it was going to get). Breakfast was sparse fresh omelettes were good. Had to buy own bottles of water as could not get a…"
 June 2018,3,"Rooms ok, food gave food poisoning","We stayed at this hotel this month. We had 3 rooms, all on 1st floor overlooking grass/ pool and the rooms were absolutely fine apart from the occasional cockroach and sewage smell in bathroom. When we first arrived we were rushed to dinner which was fine then when we came back to reception for our keys this female receptionist kept moving us aside in favour of other guests. Then eventually she gave my sister her two rooms keys and we waited to pay our city taxi and to get our key and she shooed us away and ala for the next guest to come around us in the queue. The lady looked really embarrassed and said to deal with us first and the receptionist just said no they can wait!!! I then got really angry saying we had been waiting to get our key and had a young child to get to bed…"
 June 2018,4,Great value,We came home yesterday after a 2 week stay... after reading some of the reviews I was a bit worried... no need... I have no complaints what so ever!! The room. The food. 99% of staff were all good.. I think people just like to complain.. I will say the pool area and floor around the pool could do with cleaning more often and more staff on bar in lobby but this isn't a complaint.. the bravo team work hard.. and are very friendly.. people need to remember 4☆ in Morocco isn't our 4☆ but it is good value... plenty of choice in food n of a good standard...
 June 2018,2,Average and rude staff,"Just returned from a family holiday. Wouldn't say the hotel is a 4*, dated and run down. Cleaning is very poor, fresh towels each day but bed wasn't changed once. Restaurant staff are very friendly but reception staff rude and unhelpful. Be careful booking tours with the rep at jumbo as he's a con artist. Avoid the safari trip as this was not child friendly. Food generally ok. Generally a lovely country but theft high."
 June 2018,5,Best holiday again here,"No problems Our 3rd time at this hotel Fed up with people saying too cold pool !!! Get in it!! You’ve been sunbathing it’s bound to feel cold at first !! Food is fantastic You’re in Morocco so expect some spicey food but there are always alternatives The staff are always helpful if you say please and thank you like you would expect Room was ok. I don’t spend all day in it as I only want a clean and comfortable bed at the end of the day and a clean bathroom which we got every day. Met some great people here (del and Phil) but heard alot of idiots moaning about nothing one tip.. order 2 drinks at a time, there are queues at times just waiting 10 minutes for a drink seems to annoy some people like you never do in England !!!!!! I’m already looking at booking this hotel again…"
 June 2018,4,Not sure on what the fuss is all about,"We are currently staying at this hotel. And before arriving I read many reviews and was fearful on what to expect. But we have been here now for 2 days and we are very pleased with pretty much everything so far. Is this hotel a 4 star well no probably not. But it's not that far away from it . The staff are very approachable and friendly. The food is very well presented and every pallet catered for. Our rooms are we'll kept and clean . Fresh towels each day. I haven't been hounded into buying trips. We all have a mouth. Just politely say no thank you. And that's the end of it. All in all so far our stay is a very enjoyable one. Lastly if your thinking of staying here don't take any notice of the bad reviews. This hotel is, for the money you pay fantastic!!!!.... enjoy your…"
 June 2018,2,NOT SUITABLE FOR MUSLIMS!,"My partner and I chose to bring our young kids to to this predominantly Muslim country for the last few days of Ramadan and to celebrate Eid. We were aware that Agadir is a touristy area and so were expecting to be around people enjoying alcohol etc. However, what we were not expecting was for the restaurant to be serving PORK. As a Muslim country, it absolutely doesn't matter what the bulk of your clientele like, pork is haram! If a person can't go without pig for a week, don't go to a Muslim country, it's really that simple. To make matters worse, the pig was served on a Friday, the Friday that happened to be Eid! To say we were shocked and disgusted is an understatement. Even without that debacle, this hotel is not 4 star as it claims to be. Upon our arrival we were…"
 June 2018,2,Hotel,Disappointed with the room both back views with no view being able to wake up too just bushes which i wasnt happy with staff were very rude when stated i wanted to change room wouldnt recommend to go and spend money where you are not happy
 June 2018,2,"Mediocre Hotel, God awful staff","The hotel itself could do with some renovations, the rooms were okay, however the pool area and bar areas are very tired and run down. However this has nothing on the obnoxious and rude staff. We traveled as a large group of friends (13 adults and 1 child of four). On multiple occasions we were told we could not move any seats in the restaurant to ensure that we all sit together, at one point we were told that the 4 year old with us could not have a chair pulled up to the table of 2 the parents were sitting at. As for the bar staff they are very obnoxious and make you feel that any drink ordered is too much to ask. Overall myself and the friends i travelled with have all agreed that we will never return to this hotel."
 June 2018,3,Find somewhere better!!,I have a few bad things to say and some good First bad: -RECEPTION staff extremely rude do not help you at all if anything they will laugh when you are trying to explain something to them they do not understand English particularly there is one dark coloured bald man named Kareem he is very rude and shouted whilst speaking to me serveral times -REP particularly one man called Abdul I booked four excursions with him which he only took me to two they were not worth the price and did not give any money back for the two excursions he didn’t take us to for this reason he was no where to be seen he did not attend the hotel after we paid him it ruined our holidays -CLEANERS: housekeeping stole our souvenirs and when we asked for them they lied saying they didn’t see them Good…
 June 2018,4,The best review on this hotel,"After booking I read reviews and was worried and my stay.I will try to review this hotel in depth . Pros Great location near all the bars and clubs Huge complex must have been the best when built Drinks choice ,they do serve a beer (drinkable) vodka,whisky,rum ,cocktails served not sure how strong. Staff seem very busy all the time ,not understaffed but just under pressure at busy times.a little like self service. Rooms dated ,take a sink plunger 4 of our rooms were blocked you’ll wait days to get it sorted. Was told the refurbished rooms are great I think ours was just a average room.Tv had no remote so didn’t work ,never mind we just drink more of there beer . Pools were perfect Pool staff friendly Bar staff just robots,never mind we just drink more of their alcohol to…"
 June 2018,4,Cheap & Cheerful but We've had a brilliant time :),"The term you get what you pay for applies :) We paid £584 for 2 adults & 1 child all inclusive for 1 week so we're definitely not disappointed!! It's hard to rate as the hotel is probably is a Moroccan 4 star, a Spanish 3 star....but value for money was a 5 star It's absolutely fine...the rooms are dated & the entertainment is cheap/amateur & the drinks are in plastic cups sometimes when they run out but for what you pay the pros out way the cons!! The pool is cold but welcoming when the rays are beating down, the music is mainly poorly done covers but that added to the fun. The Brava team were energetic but weren't pushy, The boys in the Brava Team do seem a little more interested in the younger females & adding notches to their bed post but that didn't affect us & the…"
 July 2017,4,Great experience!,"Very nice hotel, located in 5 minutes walk distance to Atlantic Ocean. The pool is nice. Nice atmosphere and great animation team which is full of ideas. Delicious food with theme changing every night."
 June 2018,1,Disappointed,"To start with I must say that the hotel staff were very friendly and the hotel room was kept clean and tidy. The hotel itself was ok. However- the food was shocking, did not really cater for anything else apart from spicy ( and yes I know I chose to book to a country of spice!), the drink choices were very limited and only ever 1 bar staff on. There was hardly any entertainment on and the music by the pool was like elevator music all day every day. If you were French then you got treated differently than everyone else. Highly disappointed overall and won’t be going back."
 May 2018,5,Been here 4 times now.Getting better.,"Just to say that the animation team this season are superb. The rest of hotel is still as good as always. Staff are more than helpful, and the same smiling faces. Habibi at the snack bar is the best. Food still enjoyable and plentiful."
 June 2018,3,Les Almogades beach Resort,"We flew back yesterday from a lovely week away in Morocco, when I say lovely, it’s the friendships we made. Firstly we arrived at our hotel around 9pm to be told they could not find our name on there system. ( We were definitely in the right place as had all the paper work) So we were ushered down to the dining area to eat, I guess so they could find us a room. We returned back the main reception after eating, and was then informed we had a room.. We let the gentleman know who was dealing with us that we payed an extra £80 to upgrade our room so we could have a balcony area- He informed me all rooms came with a balcony.. ( Its ok I’ll be contacting Love holidays to claim my money back for this) Anyway we stayed in room 173, which looked out on to the side of a tennis court and…"
 June 2018,2,Unprofessional and Not Worth 4 Stars,"My experience of this hotel was unfortunately not what I hoped. My general experience of Morocco was lovely, I much enjoyed the pool and the sun but any hotel could provide this. The experience was poor from the start. When first arriving at the hotel after a long flight and queueing for 45 minutes to just get into the country all I wanted to do was to get to my room, change and make my way to dinner. However when arriving they made us leave our bags in reception and go straight to dinner. Now understandably we only had an hour left of food so I did get why they wanted to rush us to dinner. However on returning, waiting around and having to fill out further paper work as well as more waiting to pay council tax and then more waiting to actually be given a key and shown to the…"
 June 2018,4,Your room makes a big difference,"Very friendly and helpful staff and food was fantastic, reception staff not so friendly. we had a room facing the road so no sun all day but the ones facing the pool had sun and a good view.So its 50/50 if you get a good room. Rooms basic but cleaned every day. Most of the rooms are twin beds. we booked a double and had to speak to the manager before we got a double, even he tried to tell us all rooms were twin. All in all a good stay but would have been 5 stars if we had a pool facing room."
 June 2018,3,Definitely not a 4 star hotel,"I've just returned from a 1 week holiday in Agadir staying at this hotel which I booked after reading the reviews on here. I went with my husband and 2 children aged 2 and 4. ROOMS: no. 339. They are very dated. But a good size with spacious bathroom again very dated. The bathtub had bits of the enamel chipped off, and shower holder was broken, but just managing to hold on so didnt bother reporting it. The water however was lovely and hot. We had a double bed and 2 single beds for the children. Small balcony with 2 chairs and a table, however we didnt get much sun and was mainly shaded throughout the day. We only had 3 towels even though there were 4 of us. When we asked the housekeeping staff and reception for extra towel, they both told us its a 3 towel policy. We made do…"
 June 2018,5,Loved it,"Was a bit wary about the hotel after reading bad reviews but it wasn’t bad at all. The rooms was clean and cleaned and tidied every day by the maid the bathroom was a bit dated but u don’t go on holiday to spend all day looking at the bathroom so that didn’t bother us, we had a nice view from our room also. The food was nice at each and every meal time can get repetitive but still enjoyed it snack bar chips and pizza was lovely too. All the staff there go out there way for you and can’t do enough Fouad was really helpful not just on the first day but through out the holiday when another couple bought an excursion from some one outside the hotel and they never turned up for them Fouad helped them get there money back. I’d recommend getting any excursions of him to be safe. The…"
 June 2018,2,Queues queues and pool police,What can I say about almohades Agadir well I can be positive on a few thing but only a few. The animation staff are ok don't really interact with the guests and only have a few pool activities well two aerobics and polo. As for the pool there is one big blonde haired police like figure he looks and speaks women in a suggestible way. He shouts if your having fun and don't have fun by throwing someones clothes in the pool he will just shout it's not a washing machine. Rooms one word RUSTIC Very dated and full of old black wooden painted surfaces. Food Very basic and very very repetitive indeed break gf AST is just rubbish unless you love omelettes and pancakes. Now the important part it's all Inc yes but if you want to get a drink of anything after lunch time be prepared to queue…
 June 2018,4,Great for the price,"Reading negative reviews before going to the hotel got us worried. But honestly it is not a luxurious hotel and you did not pay a lot so lower your expectations a little ok? Our room was cleaned everyday, was quite hot even with AC working but open balcony doors done the job. Drinks were OK, not watered down. Beer could be colder tho ;). Wine was yummy. Food was OK, loads of veg and fruit and fish. Repetitive but you'd always find something to eat. Waiters were brilliant and helpful. Cakes and any sweets were delicious. Breakfasts were my favourite meals. Chips and pizza served 12-5 at snack bar. Animators were fun, I enjoyed aqua fitness and water polo games. Every staff member we talked to was polite. Pool is big enough and there is plenty of sun beds. Area of the hotel is…"
 June 2018,4,Staff Were Amazing!,"The Staff were AMAZING! Bravo team were Brillant especially Maya & Abdoul! Lots to do! Aquagym is great fun! Good Selection of food at meal times and pizza & chips from 12-5pm. Hussan Was so lovely at the restaurant, honestly couldn't fault him very clean and lovely hotel overall - also 1 min walk from the beach with own private section! Lovely market stalls within the grounds too!"
 May 2018,4,First Time In Morrocco,"We choose this hotel as it was in a good location and not far from the airport. Our private transfer got us to the hotel within 40 minutes. All the staff gave wonderful service. From the friendly security guard, reception staff, bellboys, restaurant staff and housekeeping. Along with tipping staff where you want, it’s good to tip house keeping on a daily basis, these ladies do a great job keeping the rooms clean. Food variety may have been limited, but every dish they had available was excellent. It’s a small hotel, not much happening in regards of entertainment. That’s not a big issue as the hotel is located well. A short walk to the beach area, where there’s shops and restaurants. A taxi from the hotel to the Marina is under 10 minutes. Marina is a must to see. A few…"
 June 2018,3,It’s ok,"We are currently staying at the hotel and thought I would share some of our experiences. The good bits - the hotel is clean and the staff very friendly. Pool area is large and there is enough sun beds, parasols need to be grabbed in the morning though. Typical holiday makers reserve sun beds from early morning and show up at about 4pm. Sun beds are comfortable. The bad bits - food is awful, repetitive and unable to identify or cold. Breakfast is ok, lunch is just about bearable but the evening meal I would suggest you avoid. So many people we are talking too have been poorly. There is a macdonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut within a 10 minute walk and the restaurants on the promenade are lovely. The drinks - the pool bar run out of beer and all spirits on the first day but seem to…"
 March 2018,1,terrible Hotel,"Messy and rude staff, we got very ill for 8 of our 10 day holiday. Everything is washed in to poison they call water. Someone we were with got robbed in the street and staff didnt care. food basic and re heated. Tea and coffe have scum on. drinks watered down. Room had wires hanging down, sealant missing dirty curtains and stained mattress. If your from anywhere else but the uk you get the nice side of the hotel to stay in. Not even worth a visit, stay at home.."
 May 2018,4,Value for money,"In May I visited the hotel for a second time. No problems at all and for those who criticise you need to look at what you paid for your stay. Is it the best, cleanest, best served hotel in the world? No. Is it run by a good team (Francesco the manager is always approachable, helpful and sorts issues out) and all the staff are helpful and courteous most of the time? Yes. We all have off days but overall all the staff from the cleaner to the barstaff try hard. Food is good quality but is very French and Morrocan influenced which I would expect in a Morrocan hotel. It is well situated to the beach, shopping and leisure facilities and I would not hesitate to return. You get what you pay for and in this case that is a good value holiday."
 May 2018,3,nice staff and food but false advertising of facilities,"We have just recently came back from there. The staff was friendly, animation team good, food nice, however there is no gym, no spa and we were hoping to use those facilities and that's why we chose this resort. They should not advertise facilities they don't have."
 May 2018,5,Club Tan Tan 2018,"Another great holiday. We stayed here in November 2017 and met a great bunch of people. We had such a nice time that we decided to return in May. The area is beautiful with 8 miles of beach and lovely weather - what more could you ask for. The hotel staff were very friendly and Francisco the manager is very welcoming. The entertainment team were excellent, the best I’ve ever experienced. They work very hard running aqua aerobics sessions in the day, cooking lessons in the afternoon and providing great fun entertainment in the evening."
 May 2018,1,Simply DO NOT BOOK HERE if youre English,"Ok Ive just returned back this morning from a one week stay here booked with Tui, Im seeking a full refund based on false pictures and broken contracts, Ill be as honest as I can, if you read my other reviews I always give credit where it is due as Its good to hear both sides of any argument but this hotel really does need to pull its socks up. This hotel is at BEST a 3 star, its certainly not a 4 star as it claims its very dated and tatty, theres paint peeling off all the walls, the warning paint on all the steps has warn away leaving them very dangerous at night under dimly lit paths (there are hundreds of steps) the moroccon love there steps it seems, the pathways are wobbly concrete blocks that have gaps in them big enough to lose a big toe down, be careful IF you do book…"
 May 2018,4,Review done just for the animation team,"Traveled with a friend for one week as a quick break and on arrival we were really upset. Firstly we had a guy who came up to us and made it sound like he wanted to make our holiday the best one ever but all he wanted was for us to buy his excursions. We should have been greeted by the hotel staff not an external rep. When I told the rep that I am tired and need to rest before coming to his meeting, he was annoyed and that first impression of Morocco didn’t go down well with us. The first room we got facing a wall and shops didn’t make us get in the holiday mood at all. We just wanted to get back on the plane and go back home. The hotel it self is not a 4 ⭐️. The staff were lovely but the main shout out goes to the animation team. They made our holiday a great one. I can’t…"
 September 2017,1,Worst holiday ever!,Well where do I start? Room was not ready at the check in time waited 4 hours just to go to our room No shower curtain so water from the shower went everywhere! No towels at all and when we asked we were told we had to pay even though we were all inclusive hairs and rubbish in the bathroom No hangers to put our clothes up No receipt when we paid our tax Could not change over currency because they had no money? Food was cold and basic however cakes were amazing! Reception staff were so rude it was beyond a joke especially the ladies. Asked for orange juice and was given coke? Maids and the gents who take your luggage were lovely. Would never ever return to this hotel! When we went out we were offered drugs and all sorts.
 May 2018,3,It depends what you expect.,"Food - the food is generally good. Breakfast is basically eggs and pancakes every day, you can ask the person doing it if you want them a different way (scrambled, fried) and they'll do them. Morrocan night was probably by far the best because the chef is obviously familiar with the cusine. Other than that it's meat, fish and vegatables most nights which isn't too bad, we were just ready for something else by the time we came to the end. Beach - There's a nice bit with beds set aside for guests of the hotel and this means the locals trying to sell you stuff will mostly leave you alone (they can't come inside the rope) but you must be prepared to say to no to those who keep on (say it's your last day, yes you've had that massage already etc) it was windy while we were there but…"
 April 2018,5,Good value brilliant staff,I went to Morocco recently to the Almohades hotel. The staff were absolutely fantastic. They could not do enough for you. The food was good and the whole trip was very good value for money. Yassin who is the restaurant manager is wonderful and so are his staff Like any Muslim country the entertainment was reserved but in the country s style. There is plenty to do for children and there is a mini club. The hotel has a private beach with free loungers and an attendant you could simply relax by the pool or beach which is just across the road. You can walk all the way to the Marina.
 April 2018,4,Great family holiday,"The hotel needs updating but it is clean. Food absolutely amazing, tagine best one I ever tried. The evening entertainment was late and not great but Animation Team was fab! Swimming pool was never crouded perhaps because the water was freezing but once you in it is 👌. Beautiful beach. Excursion please come out of the hotel (through beach gate) turn left and there is a guy who is selling trips much cheaper, we really enjoyed Paradise Valley trip."
 May 2018,1,Go elsewhere,"The list is endless but I'm not going to bore you. The only plus for this hotel is the mattress was comfortable, stained to high heaven but comfy. Don't go to this hotel. If you must go to agadir, find a 5 star hotel."
 May 2018,4,Ms,"Good location and friendly staff, though cleanliness and some things expected by standard (like some shampoo or a glass for toothbrushes) were missing. However, if you are ready to be open-minded about that, then the whole stay can be a pleasant experience."
 May 2018,2,"Not again - rude staff, in need of major overhaul","This hotel can not be recommended. We stayed here for 10 nights in May 2018, 9 days due to the flights arriving/departing in the night. While we had nice moments during this vacation in Morocco, we were not happy with this hotel. We arrived around 2am in the morning and had to pay the tourist tax immediately. We had only Euro and had to pay 4 Euro more than needed. The young guy at the reception insisted so. I requested a receipt and received one in local currency. Then we got a small, dirty and noisy room, room #178. This room was extremely dirty, including the bathroom and the linen. There was no chair in the room. An extra, third bed was inside making it impossible to move around. The mattresses were totally worn out. Cockroaches were in front of the room. We were really…"
 December 2017,5,lovely hotel :-),"I stayed here over a week, first time in Morocco - all inclusive with family. I found the staff was friendly, helpful, the rooms was very clean, was a great selection of food to choice from.. the pool was clean, good entertainment, couldn’t fault it.. would recommend to anyone who’s thinking of booking here, lovely hotel, would definitely come back here.."
 May 2018,1,RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF IN RECEPTION AND AT BAR,"The hotel is reasonable and food is okay. All the drinks are watered down. The whole experience is ruined by rude and aggressive staff at reception and at front of hotel - always trying to sell trips etc to you and asking for ""commission"" ... I booked a taxi for myself to go to the airport only to find 5 others there stuffed into one taxi. I had no time to argue as I was leaving for the airport. If you go here, be prepared to be harassed by unfriendly, unprofessional and rude staff."
 May 2018,1,Stay at home save your money!!!!!!!!,"Staff is not needed here, useless no point complaining to manager does not care at all. Good place to see cockroaches and ants, room conditions all i can say is there is bed. Can go on and on but hopefully ive warned you guys well enough so you dont suffer."
 April 2018,3,Ok 3 Star with good location,"We had a rather good time from 14th to 21st April 2018. Positive: -Great location with many shops and restaurants and only 3min walk to the beach. --- --Good food, a bit repetitive after 4-5 days but still good and healthy fresh cooked food. -In general very friendly staff and not asking for tips. -room 378 on the 3rd floor had a fantastic view to the ocean and surroundings Negative: -Only 2 tiny soaps in the room (better bring your own) -beach/pool towels rental very complicated (better bring your own) -our elevator didn't work the whole week (3rd floor, room 378) -our fridge didn't work -the cocktails are all horrible and out of a machine (just tell them to mix rum or vodka with coke but stay away from pina colada etc.); We had in general the impression that in Morocco…"
 April 2018,4,Good,Hi just got back last week! Reviews were mostly positive but here are my views Positives - 1. The animation team is fab! Great for kids and for adults with lots of activities all day! Very friendly and helpful and really do make the effort to help you and get you involved. Good shows they work really hard and they were so good with our little family 2. Pool area is big with three pools always for sun beds.need to pay deposit for pool towels. 3. Beach 3 mins walk across the road. Lovely clean sand. Didn't go in the sea it was miles away from the sand and didn't look to clean. Beach sun beds provided by the hotel which is good and we're included 4. Great selection of drinks and snacks at pool bar was good. 5. Drinks served in club between 11-1 am even when lobby all inc bar…
 April 2018,2,this is not for the English,"this is more like a 2.5 star hotel first hotel I have every been to that does not offer shampoo, hair conditioner etc the room was ok the bathroom stunk .outside was nice the bravo team wear really good but all the talking was done in French did not understand a word could not join in any fun this was all for the French speaking people 2 very helpful staff where MOMO and SAID from the bravo animation .first day the showed us 2 rooms with double bed for 2 guys to share we refused to even go into to the room night time staff was not bothered until I demanded my money back to go to another hotel then they found a room for us with 2 single beds the pool was not heated .If the owners spent a bit of money on the hotel it would be a real good hotel one nice views nice garden small pools"
 April 2018,3,'Meh',"Had a few issues here. Firstly, Patio door lock was not working, being on the ground floor it did not feel safe for me and my family. There were ants all over the floors on the first night. Peeling paint all over the place. Baby cot was broken on one side. They were not willing to change the room for us either. Other guests also had complaints of uncleanliness in their rooms. Other than that...lol the food was great, staff were friendly, location was good. FYI, if you usually love fresh orange juice when you visit Morocco, this hotel does not serve fresh orange juice. Quite disappointing. It's instead some cheap powder mixture or something, it's awful."
 April 2018,4,All about Club Mini & Team Entertainment,"The Club Mini & Team Entertainment were the best highlights of our stay Guests from 5th April to 12th April 2018. A functional hotel with all facilities in working order. Housekeeping which is done everyday was above average. Maintenance team were on hand to attend and fix any arising issues/faults. Food and drinks tended to run out especially during the last hour of breakfast 9am - 10am and there was no change or improvement during our stay. The best thing going for the hotel were Issam & Team Entertainment including Club Mini run by Maya, Fati & Hajar including the bar served by Momo, Rachid and Haj. Parents can drop the kids at the club at 10am and pick them up at 5pm and the service is FREE and the best assest of the hotel for guests young children. The restaurant does…"
 April 2018,5,Great Resort,"Good location, close to the beach. Rooms were reasonable and cleaned daily but we hardly spent time in the room. Animation team was excellent, kept children and adults entertained. Good choice and variety of food to suit everyone. Overall good facility and value for money."
 April 2018,5,Amazing,Everything about this hotel is fantastic... food is amazing..location fab ... The people are beautiful spirits with super energy .. Especially the amazing animation team.. My favourite little brothers Abdul and Kalid.. love you both.xxx They treated our family with respect kindness and plenty of laughter.. Amazing guys . Momo a beautiful soul with a fab smile .. These guys work super hard.. and looked after my pregnant tummy.lol 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤ Maya a sweetheart an amazing girl . xxx
 April 2018,5,Outdtanding,"The hotel is excellent! It has amazing staff that are very lively, 2 in particular from the animation team Khalid and Abdel who made the trip fun and entertaining with their friendly way throughout all days."
 March 2018,3,Felt very average really,"Upon arrival we were ushered into the restaurant as to not miss dinner. Great idea. Checked in after that... tried to. We were taken to a room which already had guests in. Bit of a shock. Then got taken to what seemed to be a much nicer room with pool views, lovely little terrace and sun all day. Kind of got a result there. Except we had to ring reception 3 times for towels. Gave up after that until the morning when we had to physically fight them from the cleaner. WHY ARE THEY SO OBSESSED WITH TAKING THE TOWELS AWAY? Then you have to wait hours upon hours for clean ones to reappear. Anyway... onto the food. I loved it, husband hated it. There was enough choice to find something to enjoy at all meal times. Moroccan tea and cakes were very good! Red wine was excellent, cocktails…"
 September 2017,2,Very honest opinion!!,"Me and my boyfriend were looking for a cheap holiday to Morocco for mid September. We chose to go to agadir due to there being beaches! First of all if you are thinking of going to agadir be careful!! We were there for 10 days and although the weather apps and online says it’s sunny it was covered in fog for 8 days and we barely had any sun. Of course this is not the hotels fault but thought it was worth a mention. The hotel itself could use a facelift. The all inclusive is very limited, not a great selection of drinks or even a snack in the night. We couldn’t even get a bottle of water for the room one night. They told my boyfriend no and when I tried they said just this once. No spas or any special features if you’re expecting any. We were greeted on arrival and had our bags…"
 March 2018,5,Fabulous holiday in every way!,"Amazing hotel with fantastic service, great staff, food and superb entertainment!The animation team were just brilliant especially Soufian and we just cannot wait to return again.A definite recommend!"
 March 2018,4,Excellent week break.,"My husband and myself have just had a week here, and thought it was great. We arrived after a very long experience at the airport to be rushed down to the dining area as they didn’t want us to miss dinner. After a lovely meal we were checked in and shown to our room, which was basic but clean. The beds are so comfortable. Our room overlooked a garden area with a tortoise ambling about! We found the meals hot and tasty on all occasions we particularly liked the omelets at breakfast , delicious, drinks were fine local beer good . We took a travel kettle as I read there isn’t one in the room there is a fridge though. Pool was nice although chilly. The entertainment team were very good , not too pushy. Snack bar was fine chips etc . A thing we loved was the man employed by the…"
 March 2018,3,Not 4 Star in my opinion,"Arrived late due to having to avoid French airspace (typical they decide to take industrial action just before Easter commences) but when we got to our hotel there was a plated salad waiting for us in our room, organised by Mohammed front of house man/porter (nice touch) in fact if you need any assistance or information he is the best man to see as he speaks good English and has a wide knowledge of the area as he has been at this hotel for 33 years. The hotel is pretty good in general but the majority of staff, although very pleasant, spoke mainly French or Arabic as they appeared to be the main clientele and everything was geared towards them. Khalid, who worked behind the entertainments room bar (amongst other roles he played) did his best to make us feel welcome as did Ahmed…"
 March 2018,2,Mr Zed,Hotel was standard nothing special.. the first night i got there room was like in a cellar we complained and the guy at reception said we will change it for u tomorrow but the next day they refused to change it as the new guy at reception was not there when i was promised room change. WARNING GUYS please be aware of Abdul the Excursion guy HE IS A RIP OFF sold my family boat cruise MADE IT SOUND LIKE A CARIBBEAN CRUISE food and drinks served he said..charged £160 but he never mentioned that its gonna be an old fishing boat.. he also was aware that my son is diabetic and promised us that food would be on boat with drinks which was a BIG lie.. all my kids got sea sick we had to beg the guys to turn back.. complained to Abdul who refused to give refund and hotel reception was just…
 March 2018,1,Not up to expectations,"On arrival, we were shown to our, to the side of hotel, terrible outlook, safe with all the wires hanging out, dirty curtains and bed linen. We refused this room. Then shown another room at front of hotel, but were then told another couple had just moved to, their 3rd move. We then got a room again at front of hotel overlooking busy main road, two single beds, broken safe, but at least clean. Although there were far better rooms across the hallway, double beds nice view, we were later informed that only the bravo guests ie non British holiday companies got those, even though I offered to pay extra! We were told if one becomes available we might be moved, that never happened! Food was ok, not great and but repetitive. After a few days we decided to eat out one evening to a lovely…"
 March 2018,4,Good hotel,"Came back a week ago after booking this as a late deal for some sun and rest. Hotel was great, no problems at all. Room cleaned every day with fresh towels and food in restaurant very good for all inclusive buffet style. Always something to chose even if a fussy eater. No push for sun beds, maybe a good time of year to go. Weather brilliant. Beach a very short stroll from back of hotel. Must agree with other reviewer that entertainment was geared to the French contingent but did not bother us as we just went for weather and a chill out. Would recommend for just that."
 March 2018,5,Best hotel we've stayed on!,"If you’re going to read any review, read this. I travelled with my father and sister to this hotel. We came back home a few days ago, and we already long back to this amazing hotel when we sat on the ride to the airport. We just didn’t want to leave. This is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed on (and I travel a lot). As an all-inclusive hotel (and Moroccan tradition), you should bring tip with you. Everyone does an amazing job to give you a perfect stay. You get taken care of already at arrival and till you leave. At our arrival we were impressed of the scenery and the buildings. It looks like a first-class hotel. The door man took our suitcases to our room. First it was difficult to orientate, but we quickly got to know our ways around the hotel. We got huge rooms, and the…"
 March 2018,2,The Real truth,"So I read all the mixed reviews before going.. We came back home yesterday after a 7 night all inclusive stay. I am goung to give the honest good and bad points about this place so you can go in with your eyes open. On arrival we were greeted with a cocktail and we were shown to our room. Paid our city tax of 24 pound for a week. We weren't told anything about the hotel or area or shown where everything was. Then got to our room, smelt like a toilet and shower, bed and lights broken. Went to ask to change rooms and they said no we will fix. Maintenance man came with us and realised it was bad so spoke to his boss and got a hard time for asking if we could he moved. He showed us 3 rooms all had things wrong with them. We settled with the one with broken lights which the guy…"
 March 2018,3,"Staff were very helpful, but hotel needs updating",The hotel was more like a 3*. There was no sauna or spa or crazy golf. The pool was not heated in March and food was not very morrocan and lacked variety but was good. It was very close to beach. City centre and marina were a stroll away. Felt really safe to wonder around on our own. Had good security on both exit/entrance of hotel. Hotel and swim towels are in need of replacing.
 February 2018,3,Not really 4*!,"Great location for the beach and corniche walks. Buffet meals were typically Moroccan and of good quality but become a little predictable after 2 weeks! Decoration is a little tired and could do with a revamp especially the spacious (but soulless!) public areas. Rooms were comfortable but lacked basic 4* amenities such as toiletries and paintings on the walls! Bathroom was shoddy with poor grouting, painting and stained taps. Most staff were excellent especially excursion organiser Abdul who went that extra mile! (Ask for him by name at reception). Overall, though, a nice stay"
 March 2018,4,Nice break,"Positive in general with few point to improve. Room was not very clean dusty and very basics. Food nice and plentiful for each meal. Best part of this hotel is the animation team that interact with everyone no matter where they from, we had few rainy days and they all made them days better big thank you to Abdel, Jo and YouYou. The beach is 2 min away and it is really nice walk. Hotel needs a bit of TLC as it’s seen better days. Took us 2,5h hours to get to the gates on airport, we had to queue for ages to show 3 time the passport."
 March 2018,4,Animation team are great. Food is not bad and they change it up each day,"When we arrived the check in was quite chaotic and disorganized but I think a lot of people arrived at the same time. We were shown to the restaurant to get something to eat which was good as we were hungry There is a tax , its £20 for the week, we were allowed to pay in the morning. We changed money there and the rate was good make sure you do this is the morning though. Location is great, however the hotel looks a little tired and outdated. Could do with some finishing touches and also the rooms need a bit of TLC. The grounds are beautifully kept and people are constantly working on them. We were there for a week and three days were poring with rain and thats where the animation team were great. They interacted with the guests and played games which was great and passed…"
 November 2017,4,Pleasan all-inclusive hotel near the beach,"The hotel is mostly frequented by package tourists from Britain, Germany and France. The facilities are excellent, 2 large pools with sufficient chairs. The pool is not heated in winter and during our stay (November) the water was rather cold. The restaurant offers a good selection of European and local dishes, with emphasis on the latter. There thematic dinners, some with entertainment. Alcoholic drinks are served; local wine is rather good. The staff is friendly. Rooms are in 2 wings and the quality differs. In the main building all rooms have the same size. but some are on the ground floor without view. The location of the hotel is excellent, close to the beach and tourist centre of Agadir. There is a section on the beach reserved for hotel guests."
 March 2018,5,Bravo club animation,"Thank you very much for the beautiful program!! Specially Maya, Souka, Alex, Foufou, Momo,youyou and another! You are THE BEST!!! Our holiday was perfect becouse of you 😘 Thank you, we will come back soon...much love"
 February 2018,4,"Amazing people, Nice Hotel, Brilliant Value!","I'll start by saying..every single member of staff here was a gem! Big Thank you going out to them! I left my phone (samsung 8) by accident in the taxi after a 2 hour camel ride and I got it back!! Only because of the combined effort of the hotel manager Abduraheem (i think i got his name right) , the taxi driver and the guy (Abdul) who had arranged my tours and excursions.. The Bravo and animation team were both amazing.. Jo, Khalid, Maya and Momo..are just ace..as are the rest of the teams! I kept an open mind having read mixed reviews on here.. and it was definitely not disappointing. The rooms were cleaned everyday of our 7 night stay and the towels changed daily also. The food varied everyday, we enjoyed it, there was just about enough variety, the waiters were all…"
 April 2017,5,nice hotel,Very Nice Hotel with friendly staff and superbly clean. rooms a good size and comfortable. very close to beach with great walks close by. Plenty of bars and restaurants close bye. high rooms with sea view give a great view of the coast
 February 2018,4,Great value for money.,"I went with a friend to this hotel for a week in mid-February. We chose the destination for the almost guaranteed winter sunshine, which we got apart from one day. However, be aware that it can be quite cold in the evening and before 10 am in the morning, so jumpers recommended !! The bedrooms are cosy and with fully adjustable heating or cooling as required. The beds are very comfortable and I slept like a log every night ! The food is tasty and varied; hot breakfasts are available (but not bacon for obvious reasons). The hotel is well designed and in a good position close to the beach and local shops. There is an excellent swimming pool complex including one for children. During our stay there were ample sunbeds available. It was lovely and hot in the direct sunshine and well…"
 February 2018,5,Excellent!!,"Weather has been amazing, entertainment is great as is the food and drink options, definitely recommend!

A big group of people working really hard from 9 am to 1 am to make sure You are taking the most of Your holidays. I’ve never met such a nice bunch of people in my life ( I travel abroad on avarage 3 times a year). Khalid, Abdul, Maya, MoMo, Souka and others. You are simply the best!!

 February 2018,1,Worst hotel I've ever stayed in,"Hi Just feel I have to warn English people about this hotel, we have stayed in hotels around the world for over 30 years and this is the worst we have ever stayed in,where do I start well first of all the hotel is supposed to be 4 stars what a joke it's 40 years old and you tell that the moment you arrive I would call it a 1 star compared to the other 4 Star hotels in the resort the rooms are so basic the bathroom is terrible enamel coming of the bath the shower is like something from the 50s, the hotel does not cater for the English not once in a week did any of the animation team speak to us, now to the best bit the food what a joke it is rubbish there is hardly any choice the hot food is nearly always cold , the entertainment is rubbish,I could go on and on in a nutshell I…"

The personal is really good, ecspecially Maya, really good dancing!"
 February 2018,5,Great holiday with Bravo Club,"I'm very satisfied with my stay here. Very nice food and drinks, close to the beach and ocean, private pool. Special ""thank you"" to the Bravo Club team, when we weren't at the trips we could count on that we will have many things to do thanks to them! Best animators we could've ever imagine- just say what you need and they will make it happen. Big thanks to Momo, Foufou, Maya, Souka, Khalid, Rania and Alex for your hard work and making so big effort to make our holidays the best we ever had! I hope I will see those guys again and that I'll come back here again :) Totally recommend it."
 February 2018,5,Holiday,"Great place to go for holidays :) We’ve been there in February for one week and it was for sure not enough time ;) Great animators team from Bravo Club (Maya, Souka, Momo, Foufou, Khalid, Rania, Alex- schokran! :D) made sure that we will not get bored here. During the day, guests have an opportunity to take part in lessons of belly dance with, arabic, zumba, play darts and ping pong. The food is very good here, the hotel is very close to the beach and has it’s own pool. I hope I’ll come back here soon :)"
 February 2018,5,Best hotel in Agadir!,"Bravo Club- best animators, really :) They take care of all guests, make a big effort to entertain everyone ;) You can take arabic lessons with Maya- best teacher EVER, dance zumba with Alex, play darts with Momo, learn the belly dance with Souka, play ping-pong with Ranya. Food is very delicious from local foods to known in whole world like pizza and fries ;) In the night you can enjoy the show in the theatre or have fun in disco. We really recommend it, we never had so much fun and never been so much relaxed like here! :)"
 February 2018,5,Bravo club,"I honestly don’t know what all these negative people have to moan about with these bad reviews, at first they really put me off! I’d advise to ignore them because I had a brilliant time. Staff work so hard to make your stay the best they possibly can! Maya & Soukal really stood out :). Food was lovely, something different to eat every night with lots of choice. Really nice beach, good shops, bars & activities to do! Thank you all for a lovely holiday 😁"
 February 2018,4,Amazing holiday....amazing Animation team,"First I need to start by saying I was a little apprehensive about going after reading all the negative reviews but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Me and a friend stayed here for 4 nights,5 days at the end of January, upon arrival we were greeted by Abdul who was a lovely man, we checked in and were told to go for lunch until our room was ready. The lunch was lovely with loads of fresh salad and things to chose from, the waiters were friendly and welcomed us. When we got to our room we were a little disappointed and had a few concerns, we raised these with hotel reception and management and we were in fact moved to a better room with an amazing view of the hotel and Agadir beach. The bar staff were a little hit and miss with some being very friendly and others not…"
 February 2018,5,Amazing Bravo Club entertainment!!,"Relaxing and enjoyable stay with something to do for everyone. Right next to the beach and lots of fun to be had with the Bravo Club team. Team rep Maya was very helpful and there was never a dull moment when she's around. Would highly recommend, ask for Maya on arrival and you'll never look back! :-)"
 May 2017,3,Dissapointment,"Hotel surrounding was nice. Grounds clean and well maintained. Standard rooms (nothing to be excited about), balcony view was dissapointing, on 1st floor you could olny see other balconies. Rooms and hotel was very clean. The food was biggest dissapointment... it was tasty but very small choice and it was nearly the same food everyday. Especially breakfast and lunch was exactly the same everyday. Dining area was too small for amount of people in hotel. Close to the beach and centre. Staff was just ok, nice but nothing else. Entertainment team was very good."
 February 2018,4,Just arrived,"Hi all we read some really off putting reviews before we arrived, we have only been here a few hours but so far the hotel and staff have been really nice just been for a meal in the restaurant and the food was very good with a great selection. I'll pop a proper review on at the end but please don't be put off by some of the negative comments on here."
 January 2018,5,Bill burroughs,"Lovely clean hotel, there is a great selection of well cooked food and the staff are were great, nothing was too much trouble, thanks to Rania Mounadel and the rest of the animation for keeping us all entertained."
 February 2018,5,Amazing holiday...amazing Animation & show,"I want to start by saying that I had massive reservations about here after reading some awful reviews! Well don’t judge a book by its cover ! We was greeted from start to finish and yes it was very full of French people, but there’s a reason for why a lot of French people go to Agadir and if people took the time to find out then they would understand. Hotel staff are polite and are always asking if your ok and if everything is ok, we did have a problem with our room and when we highlighted our issue, we were moved rooms. The holiday is amazing which we are still on at the time of writing this review and a huge mention to the Bravo Club who work extremely hard, they make a real effort with all the guest. A special mention to Alex who is head of the shows and his team…"

 January 2018,5,Amazing holiday,Was a fantastic holiday with amazing staff. Especially the entertainment staff Maya and Momo were absolutely amazing and really didn’t want to leave as they made our holiday great fun including getting on stage to act pears which we like doing xxxxx
 January 2018,5,Great week away,Maya & Momo are excellent reps. The entertainment was fantastic. Hotel is clean and fresh towels every morning. The food was nice too. Would definitely recommend to friends and family. The pool is a great place to spend the day. The beach is a short 3 minute walk from the hotel.
 January 2018,1,"Absolutely disgusting, Avoid if you can","This hotel can not be classed as a beach resort as the beach is at east half a mile walk from the room,across a busy main road! All inclusive is a joke as soon as you get there your told you have to pay city tax at 17.6dirhams a night per person. There was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, as us British like our tea. There was a small fridge that was rusty and falling apart and didn't always work, the bar staff would get annoyed when you kept going up there and all of them had an attitude. There was no kind of greeting when we got there and wasn't told when we would see the rep. When we did see him he was as useful a chocolate teapot! , The tours are more about getting your money than actually seeing anything. Our room overlooked the carpark and road. The…"
 January 2018,4,Okay hotel but great staff,"The hotel rooms were a bit dated so not a 4 star! Fairly clean however the staff were very friendly and will bend over backwards to help. Food was great too!! The animation team were great fun and really kept everyone engaged and entertained, especially Foufou, Simo, Alex, Rania, Khalid and Souka. Karim on reception desk was very helpful. We didn’t pay much so seemed like a bargain for what we paid for!!"
 January 2018,3,to much french,I have just returned from a week here with my husband and friends when we got there everything looked great but when we got to the rooms we were disappointed in the bathroom the toilet was hard for some people to use because it was half under the sink the plug in the sink couldn't be opened because there wasn't anything to pull it up with. The balcony kept getting flooded and we had to keep asking them to come and sort it out also we had to keep asking for toilet rolls and towels that didn't always get left in our room.Very few of the staff could speak English all they were interested in was getting tips.We went on a couple of trips and was disappointed in them because we didn't get to see what we were supposed to all the tour guides were interested In was taking us to friends…
 December 2017,4,Enjoyble stay at Les Almohades,We stayed at the Les Almohades resort for 2 weeks over the New Year period. It is in a great location just a couple of minutes walk from the beach. I agree with Sylvia D - I also thought that I could not have been staying at the same hotel as some other reviewers! The meals were good with plenty of choice. The New Years Eve buffet was excellent. Most people went early for the meal but we went later and there was still plenty of food. Someone said that there was only a continental breakfast which is untrue. There was a good choice of food at breakfast. I like a cocktail on holiday and I think that these could be improved and served in cocktail glasses. The cocktails all tasted similar. Staff on Reception do speak English as most of the staff did and we found everyone to be polite…
 January 2018,5,Excellent holiday,"We spent a very amazing holidays, all crew members were friendly speciely Bravo club entertainment team we stay remember you guys and Thank you KHALID you make our holiday. Bang bang. Food was beauty. Bar drinks bang, bang. Just loved it. All round bang bang"
 January 2018,5,Lovely experience!! (Sofeha),"Les Almohades Beach Resort Agadir We arrived 13th until 16th of Jan, we found the hotel very clean and staff very friendly. Rooms were nice, clean and very comfortable. Pool area was clean, and great atmosphere with soft music playing in the background. Food was nice with great variety of different dishes. The best part of the trip was the Animation team they were great entertainers very friendly, polite going around talking to everyone making sure they enjoying there trip. Foufou,khalid,simo,Alex,rania,souka,Momo,youyou, all of you made my trip memorable, excellent entertainment from you all. We met some great people who we will miss. Beach was 2 min walk away, this hotel is situated in a great place. Great staff in whole hotel!!"
 December 2017,3,Could be improved but not terrible,"We arrived at the hotel on 27th December as booked this to get away for New Year' Eve. The reception staff have very basic English and do appear to be rude. We took the key and went to find the room, we had not been told we were in another block so it took a while to find the room and the corridor we were in had no lights. The room it's self was good, it had a pool view and was clean but had a really bad smell of burn which we informed the staff on and after 1 day of investigating turns out was a dodgy light fitting and just told to keep the lights off! The food was not great, not much choice and if you wanted meat with anything you had to wait which meant your food was cold. Not enough crockery or glasses so they need to invest before the summer period. The staff in the…"
 December 2017,1,Worst experience ever – stay away if you can,"This was a big disappointment and enters as the second worst hotel experience of my life. Here is the story: I have several bonus nights on Hotels.com, and wanted to book an incredibly good room in Agadir – with extra money support – in addition to the bonus deal from booking so many rooms on hotels.com (for my family first day in 2018) When we arrive, the entrance is closed for cars. There is no one there. We try to see of the hotel is closed or whats the deal here. After 10 minutes a man come out of a box that is next to the entrance. He looks at us like we are wrong parked. He is irritated. We tell him that we have booked a room - and the man reluctantly open the gates to this hell whole. When we finally get into the area, the hotel manager can not seem to understand that…"
 January 2018,4,Nice hotel for a money,Just come back from holiday in Les Almohades Beach Hotel in Agadir. This Hotel is very good value for money .It s only 2 min walk from the beach .Rooms are specious and clean Swimming pool area is very clean and there is a lots of sunbeds with parasols.Staff is friendly but not many of them speak English altought they try hard to make you happy.Animation team work hard and they are great especialy with kids :)Only food let us down. Breakfast was continental with no much to choose and coffe machines were awfull.Lunch and dinner was pretty same every day very bland cold and tastless.We expected a bit more as is 4 star hotel. But apart from food we had a great time in this hotel.
 January 2018,5,Great visit.....just what we needed!,"Only here for a week as a post-Christmas treat but so wish we were here for longer! Had a great stay in a wonderful hotel with staff who are great. If you read the poor reviews on here you’ll wonder if they’ve really been to the same hotel!!! The hotel is very clean, tidy, staff are attentive and food, although a little limited for choice is very plentiful and tasty. We didn’t have a single poor meal or bad experience here. The top quality of the hotel though is the animation team. There are two teams here, one that are managed by the hotel itself and one that are contracted in....they are all really friendly and can’t do enough to make your holiday as enjoyable as possible....Fadwa in particular came to see us everyday by the pool and joined us for meals in the restaurant…"
 January 2018,4,Good Break,"Looking as previous reviews we arrived a little worried, but unnecessarily. We arrived at 2am and were checked in and shown to our room quickly, the room was a little on the small side for 3 adults but we paid for standard room with extra bed and that's what we got. City tax was 17.16 dirhams per person per night. The food was the usual all inclusive but the 3 of us with differing tastes had no issues with choice, everything was replenished quickly and we were more than happy. Beach was across the road and there is a private section for the hotel. Pool area good, pool a little cold but that was many braver people than us in the water. Only slight improvements we could suggest would be more glasses in the lobby bar as drinking from plastic glasses is poor and that the cakes…"
 January 2018,3,If your BRITISH avoid this hotel,"We visited this hotel for 2 weeks over Xmas and New Year i would rate this hotel a average 3 star hotel,this hotel is predominantly geared up for the French tourists with little or no English spoken by the staff. We asked to change rooms over the course of 3 days we were promised come back tomorrow and there will be no problem ,after the 3rd day i was taken to a room which was a worse room than the one we had,overall i found the management and reception staff very rude to the English people. Apparently this hotel has just been taken over by a French company. The rooms were clean and tidy with comfortable beds ,the TV has 2 English speaking channels i would recommend trying to get a 3rd or 4th floor room as they have bigger balconies and better views , try and get a room…"
 January 2018,5,Great Hotel,"We came for 10 days over new year with elderly parents The staff are very friendly. My parents were given a room on the second floir & found the walk to the restaurant difficult. On thr second day we requested a room change, which was given without any fuss & the porter was offered to help. The staff couldnt do enough to help & were more than accomodating, predicting our every need. The food was good & the entertainment team were excellent. Khalid & Hiba kept us entertained with petanque & darts by the pool, with dancing in the evening, expertly choreographed by Alex, a very talented dancer"
 January 2018,5,holiday,"Had a good holiday and everything was Very Good, Animation team Bravo Club was amazing, specially Khalid. he was a good friend to me and i would love to visit the hotel again. All the workers were also friendly."
 December 2017,5,Loved it!,"Really enjoyed staying at this hotel! The staff were fantastic and incredibly friendly with everyone, creating a really sociable atmosphere around the pool and in the bar areas! Food was lovely with a huge choice for every meal. The room and other areas of the hotel were all clean, would definitely stay here again! Location was really good, 1 minute walk from the beach where the hotel has it's own section with sun loungers etc. We stayed for New Year's eve and the party the hotel put on was great! Lovely winter break!"
 December 2017,3,good 3☆ but not 4,the people who work here are amazing mohamed best guy. we come for new years eve 1 week but its not 4 star at all food its ok room its ok but facilities no no heated pool internet wifi not working in many areas not soap in toilets simple thing to maintain. new years eve not table enough for all people so we wait little champagne just a bit then no 4☆ sorry guys you are nice but never this standard.
 December 2017,4,Fun in the sun,"My family and I had a fabulous time, stayed there for 5 days during the Christmas period. It was so lovely, especially the Bravo club animation team. They always made us feel welcome. I think the hotel itself needs to up their game a little if they want more British people to visit. The people at reception had poor English, the pool wasn’t really heated, and if I may suggest they should open a gym. All in all the resort was a nice place to relax and unwind, the food was good I particularly liked their breakfasts. We had a really good time thanks to the Bravo club team. Keep up the good work 👏👏 . I would recommend this resort but maybe not for the gym fanatics."
 December 2017,3,Short break,Just returned from a short break here and felt needed to point out a couple of problems with les almohades. They do not cater enough for the English and is mostly geared towards the French. If you understand French then all ok for the shows/ cabaret but if you don't then you won't have a clue what there talking about. It's Definitely not a 4 star hotel 3 at the most. Animation team worked hard and do a brilliant job and bar staff the same. Hotel itself is clean and tidy and food is ok but repeats a lot.the pool is not heated and hardly anyone used it. Lovely beach and promenade nearby which is a plus.
 December 2017,2,Christmas Les Almohades=Bad idea!,"My family and I stayed here for 1 week to come away from Christmas and cold. The Hotel itself is nice, has a good location to the beach and city. But the staff is so bad it is impossible to describe. The staff in the reception knows nothing about the hotel. But the worst thing, is that if you want to play ping pong, tennis, basket or any sports, you have a limited window to do it, because the staff has a 2 hour break in the middle of the day! What!"
 November 2017,4,You get what you pay for,"I'm going to keep this quick, PROS: • the Animation team were brilliant, always came and spoke to us and had a chat everyday! Especially Jo, Fadel and Abdoul. The hours these guys put in and enthusiasm was amazing! • Very close to the beach • entertainment in the evenings was perfectly fine. Varied evening events. • food was fine and what we expected CONS: • poor wifi • VERY cold pools • no where in the hotel to change money • broken lock on our door Overall I enjoyed my two weeks here! 👍🏼"
 November 2017,1,"HELL, food posioning, Ants, Dirt, do not put yourself at risk!","Firstly the hotel is wrongly described as it says it has 2 heated pools, sauna and crazy golf, all of these are falsely advertised and DOES NOT exist. The rooms are not as described and even in Morocco the rooms do not meet 4 star standards. Most websites have previous pictures of the hotel before its apparent ‘renovations’ these renovations are not improvements and have sadly made the hotel a lot less desirable. When we arrived to the hotel we had no welcome drink, unlike other guests who had arrived. Were eventually taken to our room, as soon as we entered the room there were stains on the walls, bedding, door and the room was absolutely filthy and dusty, we were also given twin beds which we wanted a double bed. We went straight back to the reception who made it very clear…"
 November 2017,4,excelent hotel,"Excellent hotel room, Moroccan food - there are always three meal dishes, many steamed darts, a bar is good with wine and beer is great, animators communicate with vacationers, very quiet staff, a very good place, great patio, good security."
 November 2017,2,Not a 4 star hotel,"Rooms are not bad but bathrooms looking old, need to be updated. the deposit should be paid to get beach towels for your entire stay if you lose your towel at the pool they would not refund your deposit, although the towels will be collected by their staff. Food not really great, very basic food, dirty plates, cups and utensils. the only good thing about this hotel is that they have very friendly staff. Animation team are very friendly and they work very hard."
 November 2017,4,Hard Working Staff,"Firstly, seeing so many bad reviews before I went away put me off. But having been there for 10days the reviews couldn't be more wrong. 1. Friendly and helpful staff helping with luggage and offering welcome drinks. 2. The waiters were helpful and would always be coming over if you needed anything food was good slightly the same some nights but defiantly good value for money. 3. The animation team went out of their way to entertain people - they were always smiling and would make you want to dance. Jo was so welcoming and came over to introduce himself, Hamza was very friendly aswell as Abdul. Fadwa was lovely always smiling and laughing with us. We loved the karaoke night was such a laugh. Jo was very organised and made sure everyone had a good time - Not a bad Dj Either…"
 December 2017,1,Worst place ever!!!,"One of the worst hotels I've ever been to! The wifi only works in the lobby area so having wifi in bedroom is a myth. The service is very poor! I had lost my phone in this hotel and told the manager to see if it was found. He told me to wait 5 minutes so he could deal with some people who were checking in, so I waited patiently. 10 minutes passed and he said wait another 5 minutes where he started dealing with more people who were checking in, in total 25 minutes later he picks up the phone and all he does was ask the head of room service to attend to me, where she was very quick and helpful. However it seems as if all they care about is to check you in after that its all Mary and gloomy faces. The all inclusive is a joke and more like eating cat foot. on the plus side there are…"
 December 2017,5,Fantastic entertainment,"Had the best winter break here, entertainment is outstanding day and night, Hassan the best DJ knows how to start the party and keep it going with everyone up dancing and joining in, the rest of the team teaching tourists party dance routines, special thanks to Hassan, Hamza, Abir and Abdullah for making our holiday so fantastic."
 November 2017,2,Very poor 4 star resort,"This is no way 4 star. all inclusive is also a joke. Not what you would call a Beach Resort. Go to the all inclusive beach, there is a lack of signs on the resort in how to get there. Walk across the road and along promenade until you come to the ""Les Almohades All inclusive Beach""...........what's included you ask......A SUN BED.if you want something to eat or drink you gave to return to the hotel or pay in one if the bars on the promenade. Never a clean table available at meals, or cutlery readily available. Stray cats jumping up at tables too. Room maid was lovely and very helpful. Can't say that about other staff. Pool is very small, nothing else on site. One night all we heard was car horns. Two sides of hotel overlook taxi ranks"
 November 2017,4,Good place for the price you pay,The room was very clean and tidy ample space not far from the main pool food was good the normal you would expect in an all inclusive but they had some Moroccan themed nights where they had the local delicacies which was mouth watering. The beer is bottled and well chilled and is quite nice the only Negative aspect of this place was the POOL it was ICE COLD i have travelled quite a lot and this was the only place where the pool was Empty all the time which needs to change as it was the Main complaint from all the people there . The entertainment needs to be upgraded a bit as it gets boring after the third day
 November 2017,3,"Average hotel, kind of get what you pay for","This hotel does not have any heated swimming pools as stated on the website. There was also no mini golf. Staff even said that this was said just to get tourists in. The water was painfully cold. This lead to not many activities happening with the animation team as no one wanted to go in the pool. Couldn’t really fault the rooms. The beds were really comfy so no complaints. The only issue we had was that the shower leaked and the fridge wasn’t working. Jumbo tours were useless, they said that we need to meet them the day before our flight back so that we could get our transfer time. They were nowhere to be seen. We ended up having to call them on a number they gave to have this confirmed. Food was ok, but not many options for kids. Also it did start to get a little…"
 November 2017,5,Winter vacation in Africa!,"The hotel is really nice,not high but wide. Nature is everywhere so accept you can find some bugs in your room :) says the woman, who fears bugs. service in the hotel was brilliant always smilling, willing to help. Pools are cold not heated. Food was magnificient even european food we got,still a lot to get. Gardens are awesome per day or per night.Possible to have animations,says hello to Jo. Lot of evening programs and disco as well. Try moroccan tea. Wif possible just in the lobby,restaurant,pools. No fridge in the room if you want to keep some food. Enough bottle water they gave us as water is not drinkable. They have own beach and takes 3 mins to get there. Surely recommend and happy to come again❤"
 November 2017,2,"Beautiful hotel gardens, very poor customer service.","On arrival the hotel room was not ready, we arrived at 12.30pm, and was told by the receptionist, to go have some lunch, while they finished the room off. I found it hard to understand them, as i thought it was bad, for a hotel meaned for tourist, not much staff spoke good english. They didn't make it clear where we we're supposed to eat, and we were told where the restaurant was , and i was not shown to the restaurant. This was not helped, by the language barrier. The food was okay, but bland, & repetitive. We eventually got our room at 2.30pm. When looking around the room, it was clear there standard was very below average, with stains on the duvet cover, and net curtains, as an example. The door didn't lock at all, and trying to get through to them was impossible, due to…"
 September 2017,2,Very Nice,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 7 days all inclusive. The hotel it's self is very nice, the rooms are big, cleaned everyday, the staff are friendly, and it's located in s very nice spot across the road from the beach and everything is very close! HOWEVER, the food is marginally lukewarm not surprising when they are trying to keep it warm with a tealight! The pool is like swimming in the artic circle, none of this typically british ""its alright once your in"" it's cold always! The animation team weren't great but they were friendly! If you want to get drunk then just go to the bar as they guess what a shot is, ends up being half the glass so just a couple till your on the floor thinking what just hit me! A basic level of French would also not go a miss as a majority of people…"
 November 2017,4,good,"we stayed for a week all-inclusive the room was of a good size and cleaned every day and clean towels provided the pool was great but the water is a bit cold we found the food was a bit repetitive not a lot of choice especially for the wife who is a vegetarian the animation team worked hard to keep all entertained of a daytime if you wanted to join in, the drinks where good the hotel is in a good location close too the beach we would recommend this hotel if your after a quite type of holiday as there are not many other bars in the area ."
 June 2017,4,Mixed,"My boyfriend and myself visited this hotel for 10nights all-inclusive June 2017. Upon arrival, we had a few issues checking in because of the language barrier. English from the reception staff was basic, however the rest of the staff were very helpful and bent over backwards to be accommodating. The food was quite good, buffet. The snack bar was also quite good but could get quite busy. Towards the end of our stay, the hotel got busier and naturally a bit nosier, which I suppose should be expected. We had a twin room, I asked them for a double bed and they simply put the bed together with a topper over the top, which was annoying to sleep with but having spoken to other couples on the holiday, this wasn't unusual. We did quite a few excursions through our rep, all were fantastic…"
 November 2017,1,Horrible,"Let's start with the first day, Monday! Was brought into a room that was absolutely filthy! The Porter kept telling us it'll be ready in half an hour but I just don't get why he bought us to that room in the first place! After complaining, I got a second room. Sheets were filthy (picture below) and the bath was disgusting! Food was poor. I've been to Morocco 3 times now and I've never had a problem with breakfast! Theirs consists of leftovers from yesterday's dinner/lunch, egg + leftover bread from the day before! Really not much choice. Entertainment was poor, music was low, just not much life! You can only get bottled water from the restaurant and there's a limit. The wines recycled from table to table and the room was ridden with ants (picture below) thankfully it's our…"
 October 2017,4,A good all rounder,"I have recently stayed at this hotel for 7 nights, having booked independently. I booked the hotel believing it to be a 3 star hotel. I would say it is a 3.5 star hotel that I really enjoyed staying at. The location is a strong point. It is around 3 minutes walk to the beach and to the roped off beach section with complimentary loungers. There are bars and restaurants near by and I felt safe walking the streets at night. We arrived at midnight and the night staff were fine. There was even some food in the room for us, which was just what we needed after a day of travelling. The restaurant is well laid out with tables inside and out and the food was of an above average standard at worst.I don't eat in 5 star places and for me the food was very good overall. 2 moroccon nights. A…"
 October 2017,2,Disappointed,"We've just returned from a weeks break at this hotel and unfortunately we were disappointed. The hotel has some great staff and a fantastic animation team, The family rooms which are on the lower ground floor are riddled with cockroaches making it stressful hoping nothing got in our clothes. The food was repetitive and very limited, ice cream only available at lunch time on the day we arrived and the bar staff in Tan Tan nightclub were miserable. The staff in reception and the dining area were wonderful and the beds the best we've slept on abroad."
 October 2017,4,Holiday,"Just got back from a week at this hotel & my husband & I had a lovely relaxing week. Loved the hotel although could do with having another bar to have a quiet drink in during the evening! Food was nice & varied each day. Hotel grounds are clean & tidy, room cleaned each day, although as a few others have commented put your do not disturb on the door as the cleaners don’t hesitate to let themselves in after knocking only the once! Beach is gorgeous!! Loved it ... One thing that I wasn’t to keen on was even when you go into a shop to buy crisps/coke someone tries to sell you a trip or a massage etc etc All in all had a nice week away but too many other places to visits so don’t think I shall return anytime soon."
 September 2017,3,"Food was very limited . The use of plastic ""glasses""For drinks in the lobby bar let it down as the bar staff were realy",Trying hard . The deposit of £20 for each beach towel left us with a lot of local currency (Durham) to use on our last night.rooms were well serviced by the cleaning crew.super central location .all in all it was good value for money
 October 2017,4,Great time here,"I was here with my boyfriends and another couple, and we had a great time in this hotel. It wasn't the beast hotel I've ever seen, but it was clean and staff was trying to respond to our request. We had our towels changed every day, the room services is good, and also the animation crew was super friendly, and make us enjoy every moment spent in the resort. Food was no really on our taste, but was diversified. Also we complained about the wifi, it was really poor in the rooms, you can access it only from the lobby bar. It seemed to be a peaceful and quiet place, perfect to chill out."
 October 2017,3,"No wifi in the rooms,unbelievable 😡","Very clean hotel😀,you don’t get wifi in the rooms that’s right you don’t get 😡very polite customer service and staff😀,beautiful and clean pool and areas😀, breakfast you get only few choices like egg,cheese some jams and some more things but not mains😔 bread not fresh😡and lunch and dinner the same but you will have quality foods,so 3 ⭐️⭐️⭐️for the hotel and 2 ⭐️⭐️ for the foods not more than that."
 October 2017,5,VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY,Very pleasant hotel! Comfy beds! Food is delicious and plenty. Really don't understand what are people complaining about! Staff was nice and friendly! Swimming pool is clean and nice size-with an easy access. Had a great week here and can't wait to come back!
 October 2017,5,Brilliant,"Ignore the bad reviews on here. Me and my friend went for 10 day’s and loved it. It is always kept clean and tidy, not just in the hotel but on the outside too. The staff couldn’t be more helpful, especially in the restaurant, they will get you whatever you need. You get a bottle of water, each after every meal which is really helpful when you can’t drink the water over there. The entertainment does start quite late at like 9.45pm, but other than that, nothing to moan about at all. I would 100% go back to this hotel."
 October 2017,4,1 week break,I have given it 4 rating & would of got 5 if the Lobby bar staff had been more friendly. 1 or 2 was ok but mist of them seemed like they could not be bothered & walked past you & went in the back & came out a couple if minutes later to serve you with no smiles. The hotel does not speak a lot if English but that a side the hotel is great everything else was great & we found something to eat every night & was really nice. Every other member of staff was really nice. The rooms were clean & you would pay s lot more for this type if room in the uk . The rest of the holiday makers were made up of French German etc & all really friendly. Plenty of sunbeds for everyone. We would stay here again & are planning to come back next year. If any if the managers are reading this just make sure…
 October 2017,4,Another great stay,"2nd stay here this year. Food was good, again no burgers or chicken nuggets, which is fine for me as i dont east them, lots of fresh veg salads a fruit. excellent tagins and themed nights, breakfast omlettes fried, boiled or scrambled eggs every day fresh pancakes, pastries & cereals. pizza at the pool bar. Rooms kept clean and tidy. Pool and beach areas kept nice. My only negative this time was the animation team.....rubbish, all they wanted to do was there own thing, play there own music and not really interested in the guests, so that is why five * last time & 4* this time. We will be back next year i hope"
 August 2017,2,Worst hotel,"Hotel staff are rude, when we complained they say speak with your holiday provider, they did not give us enough beds for the number of people, then they got folded beds at the end. food wasn't nice, not enough choices for children, Pancake was served one day in the whole week, room fridge was broken, bath tub was cracked. Our room tv remote was broken so they fixed that on the 3rd day. The beds were so uncomfortable, it was disgusting. They don't change the bedding by the way even if they are dirty. pool bar staff are rude, They get annoyed of serving but their cups are so small people had to ask for seconds. There were no ice cream in the hotel, only one day they gave ice cream for dessert. The only thing we enjoyed was the desserts. Kids were starving luckily we had enough…"
 September 2017,4,Not as bad as it appears from other reviews,Just got back from here after a very pleasant 2 week stay. Room was great and cleaned daily. Pool area had plenty of sunbeds and all very clean. Pools are a bit chilly but nice to cool off a bit. The food for breakfast and lunch was good plenty of choice and something pretty much all the time for even fussy eaters. Dinner was a little disappointing however but most of the time not too bad. Snack bar was good and all staff were very helpful and polite.
 September 2017,4,PLEASE don't let the bad reviews put you off!,"Please don't be put off by so many bad reviews! I was nervous after reading some of the reviews before I went to this hotel but they are so wrong! I stayed her efor a week in September with my friend and we had such a lovely time. Our room was lovely, we stayed on the fourth floor and they have the biggest balconies so try and ask for them! Rooms were clean from when we arrived and cleaned everyday. Yes, the maid did come a little too early for our liking but simply ask for a 'do not disturb sign'. Everyone was super friendly, there a a guy with a bit of an attitude from jumbo tours and even though we didn't personally book any excursions, people we spoke to do them online whilst there which was a lot cheaper and had better experiences. The food was really good,…"
 September 2017,4,Ignore bad reviews,"For starters the tourism tax for 10 days for 2 adults worked out at about £29, if you pay in cash ask for a receipt. Yes rooms are a bit dated, but clean and how long do you spend in your room? Food, didn’t go hungry, breakfast omelettes are a must, main meals weren’t overly spicy, but could be a bit on the sweet side, but always have pasta, salad etc available. Chips and Pizza at snack bar and not at restaurant so always something to eat. Pool is on the cold side, we would usually spend morning by the pool then go down the beach, which is separated but rope and the locals don’t come and annoy you, they shout but get the picture if you don’t take any notice. Plenty of animation during the day, if you are into that sort of thing, the team are friendly and always helpful. …"
 September 2017,3,Not that bad,I have been staying in this hotel over a week now it's been a interesting experience throughout. After reading loads of bad reviews was nervous about staying here. Check in is at 3pm after arriving at 12 it was a long uncomfortable wait. So be prepared to wait around if your arrival is before this time. You also have a meeting with jumbo tours or a alternative company round same time you check in trying to get you on all there trips there are cheaper alternatives outside the hotel. Food is edible its a hit and miss. Some nights are good others quite boring. a lot of Moroccan food and fish mainly It is repetitive which after a few nights you do get bored of however there are lots of local alternatives. Room was nice and clean. Has a tv (only two English channels) Beds are…
 September 2017,4,I can’t believe the poor reviews for September 2o17,"We arrived on Sat 9th as a party of 6 aged 50 down to 20. we had a problem checking in but that was due to our travel operator! Our room was fairly basic, clean and fresh but a little dated. Staff were all friendly and except for the porter, not one expected tipping. Pool area is great, clean, large and with plenty of sun beds. Private area of beach had ok loungers and was only a couple of mins away. Cleaners came to Room Earl to pick up towels but if door locked, they came back later. Food was probably the weakest area for me as I am a fussy eater but there was always something to eat. Waiting staff in restaurant were constantly cleaning tables unlike a review I read earlier! Bottled water was definitely not from a tap as we saw many 6 packs of water being opened. My only real…"
 September 2017,5,Fabulous holiday,"I’m not one to usually write reviews but having seen so many negative ones for this hotel prior to going on holiday I think it deserves a positive one! All the people complaining about basic food, basic drinks, basic rooms - what do you expect for this price? It is such amazing value for money. The food was ok, what you expect for your money. Basic all inclusive much the same as you get anywhere similar, they did do a moroccon themed night though which was nice. We didn’t pay for a safe and the maids didn’t steal anything - please don’t be put off by others saying they have. I couldn’t fault the maids they kept the room tidy and clean. Only thing I would suggest is a do not disturb door hanger to prevent being woken up at 8am by the maids trying to come in! The animation team…"
 September 2017,4,I miss it already!,"The stay at the hotel didn't start in a good way. We were placed in a depressing room, smelling of mould, with no shower curtain, no soap, the TV wasn't functioning, the bathroom was quite small. We complained at the reception and we were informed that we would be moved to a better room the next day. And so it happened. This was a much better room, with a view to the swimming pool and has it was on the 3rd floor we could see the iconic mountain of Agadir. The room had a balcony, the TV was much better and the bathroom was bigger. It is not what you would call 4 star, but it was nice and clean. It was a bit upsetting that the cleaning ladies wanted to take our towels really early in the morning everyday. Apart from this, everything else was really nice. The food was amazing…"
 September 2017,5,Not sure about the bad reviews...,"After a 12 hour travel to get here from Bristol me and my sister were very tired, check in was as 3, they managed to push it so we got to our room at 2, staff are brilliant, very friendly, room was clean and sheets clean, food amazing, bar, animation and waiters all very friendly, drinks flowing, pool is slightly on the cool side but after a few hours in the African heat it's very refreshing. Not sure what all the bad reviews are about? We paid very little for this holiday and have so far got a lot out of it! Music isn't repetitive, food isn't boring, everything is just how we want it whilst on holiday!"
 September 2017,3,Good hotel food nad,"Rooms and hotel well worth 4 stars! Rooms cleaned everyday with daily fresh towels. Room was well equipped, shower was amazing. Room and balcony really clean and fresh couldn't fault it. Hotel staff were amazing!! Food...wasn't for us at all, seemed as though alot of the food was re used.. wouldn't trust the bottled water you get. Majority of the bottles had obviously been either filled up at the tap or topped up from other bottles..made me really poorly. Pool was great really clean although the water was cold it was a nice escape from the heat. More umbrellas are definitely needed tho! Entertainment was the same every day by the pool so got really boring. The tea room at night with the sheeshas were great 100dh. Shame the hotel didn't have a little shop!"
 September 2017,1,"dirty, run down rude staff","this hotel is more a one star. the food was poor, not much choice and cold. The plates were all chipped and dirty glasses. not once did I see a table being wiped down. there are supposed to be 2 restaurants but only one. the rooms are in bad condition. our first one smelled of sewerage, bathroom filthy and the TV was broken. in the 2nd room the fridge was missing. Staff are rude and not helpful at all. a maintenance man just walked into the room without saying a word, to change a bulb. after 3 nights we only had one bulb working in the room but after asking, no one came to replace. The maids were knocking on the door every morning before 9am for the towels. we ate out most of the time. Don't waste your hard earned money on this dump, its not worth it."
 September 2017,3,Meh....,"pool is well kept and always a sun lounger available. Not enough umbrellas or shaded areas for those who burn easy. Got to the hotel at 11.30. Check in is not till 3 so had to sit around for hours in jeans waiting to get the room. Food is very it and miss. 5 mins...most of which is left overs from the previous meal so if there was stew for lunch you will have it for dinner. Lots of fish but not much else. Morocco night is various tagines which were lovely. Snack bar is over salted chips and pizza. No night time entertainment at all for adults or children. Small reception bar and the only place to get Wi-Fi Poolside has music which is way too loud all day, unless happy house or dub steps is your thing take ear plugs lol. They do away aerobics about 20…"
 September 2017,1,September 2017,"Awful hotel and staff do not go food was cold staff were so bad didn't want to do anything for you and we'll the hotel wouldn't even give it any stars looks nothing like the pictures on the internet cockroachs are huge not clean at all. The rooms are not clean at all this hotel has so many issues it's unreal, shower was smelling of stagnant water when running bathroom was dirty not cleaned very well balcony was filthy needed to wash our feet once been out there, we complained while there and staff did nothing Jumbo tours and reps were so rude and didn't want to give you the time of day had so many arguments with them, just as were the sun was out, the pool area was dirty and dangerous and the hand rails to get in the pool were either Brocken or not fixed properly which was…"
 September 2017,4,Great food,"Just returned to UK. Had a great time. Positives: food - amazing. Moroccan night with tagines, dates, couscous. Lots of beautifully prepared vegetables. Great choice of salads. Meat and fish dishes. Clean grounds. Clean rooms. Lovely location. Negative: very cold pool. For the price I would recommend this hotel to anybody."
 September 2017,5,Considering the price this place is fantastic,"We paid £800 for two people including flights 1 week all inclusive. For this price we didn't expect much but this place really surprised us. It is not without its problems, but these are minor, and, like I says before you have to consider the price. For example one afternoon they ran out of all alcohol except gin (as a gin drinker this was fine for me though!) and the entertainment is really naff and cheesey (but when isn't it!) the rooms are basic but cleaned to a good standard daily. But overall we loved it here. The food was amazingly good. No greasy child, burgers or chicken nuggets in sight! But instead a wide variety of delicious tagines some of My favs bring the chicken and lemon one, the prune one, the chickpea one and the onion and sultana one. Fresh bbq'd fish was…"
 July 2017,3,Nice Break,"30 mins from airport via private transfer. Quick check in after meal in restaurant, city tax 370 dirham for the 3 of us. Room basic but clean and lovely view over the pool. Clean towels each day. Safe in room but didn't use it. Fridge but nothing in it. Restaurant staff were lovely esp Fatima-Zara always somewhere to sit and drinks brought promptly to our table. Food hit and miss but could always find something to eat, nice fresh salads and wide variety of desserts. Children do struggle as mainly Moroccan dishes so lots of different herbs and spices and different cuts of meat. Breakfast was good with fresh omelettes made each morning. Pool was a good size and never too busy always got a sun bed and didn't need to put a towel down early. Snack bar made fresh pizza each day was…"
 August 2017,3,Two weeks holiday in the Resort,"The worst holiday ever. They stole our belongings in the resort.We came back to our room one day and found out that our room had been ransacked. This was the second day we arrived.My daughter's mobile phone,make-up bag and my scarf stolen.Only God knows what else. We reported this to the hotel management but they did nothing about it. We were scared each time we went back to our room. The food was very repetitive,too salty and had no taste. The animation team was not as good as we expected,a lot of boring moments. Not enough snacks and the snacks available were not good. The chips were too dried and the pizza too salty. The customer service was also very poor. Some of their rooms were dirty and not modern. The list is endless. Even some of the resort's staff we spoke to had…"
 August 2017,2,Problem after problem,"So many problems with this hotel, one or two wouldn't have caused a problem but with so many it ruined our holiday. The staff were rude (other than one barman) being two females we were looked down on from the male staff. The food wasn't too bad but the queues for everything from cutlery to the BBQ made meals un enjoyable. 3 of our evening they completely ran out of the main meat. Not once did I see someone clean a table before relaying it. We were given bottles of water where the seals were BROKEN and filled to the brim meaning that they had already been opened and obviously refilled - explaining why us and everyone we spoke to had dodgy stomachs. DO NOT book trips from the reps in reception they are a con and if it goes wrong will not help to sort it. Towels were taken…"
 August 2017,4,Good 3 star,"We visited les almohades beach resort in agadir in August for 10 days, 4 adults and 1 child. Check in was fairly quick, the usual forms that's you have to fill in, quite like Tunisia.. We were shown to our rooms, and our suitcases were brought up 5 minutes after. When we first got to our rooms the electric wasn't working, we told the guy who brought our suitcases and they quickly sent someone to fix it. Rooms were fine, basic and clean, exactly what I would expect from a 3 star, our air conditioning wasn't the best, but my son and his girlfriends who were next door was really good. You do have to pay for the safe, but we kept everything in our suitcase locked up and didn't have a problem with that. The pool area is fairly busy, although we didn't have any problems getting a…"
 August 2017,4,Fab holiday,"The hotel was fine, rooms cleaned daily, but entertainment was a let down and variety of food for children was too. Adults can find ways to enjoy themselves but children need to be entertained!! Restaurant was nice and bar and snack bar was excellent. Swimming pool could be bigger for the size of the hotel as it felt like you were in a paddling pool with a hundred people, the pool was clean so overall ok but could do with some new ideas and inspiration to give it a lift as this would potentially make it a much better hotel to go as the staff are excellent."
 October 2016,5,Great location,All inclusive with lots of variety in the food. 2 minutes away from the beach & town centre so saved quite a bit on catching taxis as we just walked there & back. Town was right on our doorstep. The entertainment guys Ayoob & Omaidah (Bushra) were 2 of the best I've seen as they couldn't do enough. Plenty of entertainment on & wouldn't hesitate to stop here again. Hope take the family next year.
 August 2017,2,Pick another Hotel,"This Hotel is allegedly a Four Star! Let me tell you that it's certainly not. Reception area is not very welcoming and to small.When we arrived there was no welcome drink,the only staff to hand were the suitcase carriers and they just wanted a tip! Checking in was slow, staff very abrupt,no recognised person from holiday company there to meet and greet. Rooms are very basic and very noisy, most rooms only have twin beds pushed together,bathrooms are a disgrace,mold everywhere,missing tiles and badly patched tiling.Hot water ran out several times,there apppears to be a shortage of Towels at this Hotel, Maids would just walk into your room very early in the morning and take your towels ( you could be asleep but they still take them) if you were lucky you would get them all back by…"
 August 2017,4,Nice place but don't go all inclusive,"Looked for a while for a family break to agadir. Finally settled to go with On the beach holidays, and got an all inclusive package for the 4 of us. Paid extra for 15kg baggage with Ryan air as 10kg each defo isn't enough. Also arranged transfers to and from hotel with their rep company ""Jumbo Tours"". From the moment the picked us up all we got was, "" don't use anyone else apart from us, we are insured and others are not. We had read about this on TripAdvisor before flying out. So we just nodded and went about our way (see jumbo tours for their full review- in genera just avoid them) Back to the hotel: -Pleasant place in a good location -Most staff are polite (considering they work 12 hour shift for £10) -Pool area is cramped but clean, sun beds are sufficient (but reserve…"
 August 2017,3,Pleasant enough but not like the pictures,"Hotel - Arrival - be ready to pay tax ! For just me and my boyfriend it was 250 dirham for the week ! Staff were ok but the reception could have been better Reception area is quite nice with marble floors and nice pictures Entertainment - ok Positive - Animation - great in the day with dancing, water aerobics, water sports and kids games. Staff are lovely and one of the lads from the animation team were always there to have a chat and a silly dance. Negative - No singing , dancing or acts in the evening just games now and then and one night was even just Madrid vs Barcelona so evening entertainment needs improvement but day time is good. Nightclub - poor - More of a room with loud music then a nightclub which can sometimes just be Moroccan music. Usually quite and…"
 August 2017,3,Okay..nothing special,"The check in is a nightmare, have to pay around £32 tax for 1 week..the WIFI is awful, only seems to work in the lobby or near the exit gates at the rate of hotel(very on and off), the food is nothing special..they make u have a meeting at 10am the next day you arrive with a tour rep(don't book anything, just get the price list and then look elsewhere, plenty of tour reps outside the hotel). Macdonlds/KFC is like a 15min walk to to beach front! Get currency exchange outside the hotel, the hotel never seems to have any...personally I would give this hotel a 3* rating..very basic"
 June 2017,5,Fantastic Holiday Will Return Again Next Year With Family,"We went here the first two weeks of June and couldn't have had a better holiday. My husband is disabled and the staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. The room was cleaned every day. The food was delicious and plenty of choice, there were always tables available inside or outside. The waiters work very hard clearing and resetting the tables, also at lunch and evening meals they served the drinks and always checked everything was ok. The boys at the bar Abdoul and Ali (hope I have spelt the names right) were fabulous and we had a lot of fun with them and looked after us. The Animation team could not be faulted. They asked us to dance but didn't make a fuss, Abdoul is a fabulous dancer they all were. Abdoul would even sit and chat with us and joke with my husband…"
 August 2017,3,Les AL MY DAYS!,This is the 2nd time we have visited agadir and so we have something to compare it to .The first time we stayed at the Rui timid dunas just up the road from the hotel we are now residing in the Les Almohades beach resort .My wife Sharon and myself have been here almost 2 weeks now the weather has been extremely hot on several of the days hitting 46 degrees a few days ago.Other times its been overcast with some hot spells intervening.Location of the property is just across the road to the beach which leads to the marina where you will find some shops and restaurants.A few of the locals you will pass will try to sell you things e.g. henna tattoos a polite no will suffice.The staff cannot be faulted in any shape or form they are like a crew on a ship using buckets to clear the…
 August 2017,4,Lovely staff,"Have just spent 2 weeks here with family ages ranging from 87 to 7. The staff are so accommodating and helpful. I have no idea why people complained about the reception staff because they were fine. Check in was a bit chaotic so just try to be patient as it does get sorted. Rooms were fine, spacious enough and shower was good too. The cleaners were excellent. Entertainment was good during the day but sorely lacking at night. The disco is ok but repetitive. The snack bar is fine during the day of u like pizza and chips and melon! Alcohol is in abundance, the generosity in measures is amazing. Food was ok I just found two weeks of it was too much... The walk To the beach was fine and lovely to have own area and not have to pay for sun beds. Def visit the souk, camel rides and…"
 August 2017,3,These are my salad days,I am sitting here right now in this hotel drinking a large vodka and coke as it's the best meal of the day as the food is so bland and repetitive we arrived on 3rd August staff try hard and are mostly always smiling they put in long hours hardly no evening entertainment rooms very basic always chasing towels we got a good balcony view on 3rd floor overlooking the pool men are very letchey sleazy being blond with blue eyes I felt very uncomfterble out of the hotel beds are a free for all in the morning with family's of 5 or more taking up whole rows even moving other people's beds to fit there's in very annoying wouldn't come back prefer turkey hope this helps
 July 2017,4,Good visit except reception staff,"I visited here with in July with my sister for a week. It was very quick journey from the airport, around 30 minutes. Some advice for the airport, bring spare pens, you need to fill out an arrival and departure form. Also remember to exchange your dirhams when leaving, before you go through security as you won’t be able to use them. City tax is 17.20 dirhams per person per night, the hotel takes card, make sure you get a receipt for this. The hotel grounds are well looked after, there are seagulls as it's next to the sea but the hotel can't do anything about it. The room was a bit small but did it's job and was cleaned daily. I enjoyed the food, but it’s not for picky people as they don’t serve chips/fried food during meal times. But if you go out you can find somewhere…"
 July 2017,1,HORRIBLE! NEVER AGAIN!,"I have just come back from Les Almohades one day ago and i am writing this review to save others from the horrible experience that i had. Positives (there's not many): 1.) location good as the beach is across the road 2.) lots of shops but overpriced Negatives (sit back and grab a cuppa coz this will be long): 1.) After an early morning flight with no sleep, we were dropped off to the resort to be disappointed with the front entrance. Never seen such a poor and out dated front entrance such as this 2.) No porters to take our luggage's 3.) No welcome drinks 4.) Reception area is dull and boring and unwelcoming 5.) Staff are rude and unhelpful except for El Mustapha. The majority of staff do not understand English so it is hard to communicate with them 6.) Our rooms…"
 July 2017,1,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH HERE!,My family and i arrived at the resort on the 27th July 2017. I will start by listing the positives as the list will not be very long at all! Positives: 1.) The location of the resort is great as it is just across the road from the beach and has a long parade of shops that you can shop from. There are also many currency exchange places nearby which made shopping a lot easier 2.) The only member of staff who was extremely helpful and welcoming was a man called El Mustapha (who works at the reception desk). Mustapha always greeted us with a smile and was quick to help and sort things out when I lost my luggage at the airport and also when i needed my room to be changed due to its lack of hygiene. Negatives (Get ready because it's a long list!) 1.) Upon arrival the front…
 July 2017,5,Wonderful time,It was a lovely 2 weeks.there was enough variety of food to choose from.entertainment poolside was lovely.all staff very friendly.not one downside.very good value for what we paid.we made sure we tipped well as all staff were out of this world.very highly recommended.i just hope the management appreciate with out wonderful staff they don't have a busy hotel.i must also pay tribute to Noureddinne Charlie the jumbo tours rep .we booked a few excursions with him.he wasn't pushy but ulta helpful and wasn't disappointed with the tours he comes highly recommended
 July 2017,3,Wouldn't go back!,"Good: pool, animation team and location by the beach and food are great Bad: customer service is awful by reception staff. Were made to feel guilty for asking for a bottle of water to take to my room for kids. The opening and closing of restaurant is to military timing and the manager is so miserable. U cannot even take a piece of fruit out of the restaurant. U will be told to put it back. It was so annoying when the waiters would take ur plates even before all of u have finished ur meal. Always felt rushed. The rooms are clean but bathroom could do with updating. The corridors are never cleaned. Very stingy on drinks, given in tiny plastic cups. And only one place to get in the lobby in the evening. Queue were so massive it was easier not to bother. All in all I wouldn't…"
 February 2017,3,sleepy,hi all very sleepy dull and quiet hotel we went all inclusive food was very limited repeated the chap in the bar looks sad not a nice place but me and wife had a great time the entertainment chaps were great the poolside bar was nice most of all the staffs were nice
 July 2017,3,such a lovely holiday,"hotel : very nice resort close to the beach only 5 min walk . food was okay friendly people except when you go out with family for walk by the promonad you get much husle and pushy people to buy stuff and activities .. to be honest we don't use to it we booked our holiday through on the beach and our transfer with jumbo tour group , thanks Noureddine for been an amazing rep he give us all information that we need in our holiday booked : city tour which is very good idea to explore the city and souk (Market) the kasbah . Camel ride sunset view and we did also massage and hamam with scrub it was realy the best . we will be back soon to this lovely country."
 August 2016,4,Nice hotel,Good: Great entertainment personal. Nice venues on evenings. Good food. Big pool. Very clean. Bad: To get to beach you need to go out of hotel and over the road (you are not allowed to take any drinks with you). Small rooms. I was with 4 of my friends. 2 of us in one room and 3 in another. In other room they brought just folding bed for third person. I was shocked. Interned only in public not in room.
 July 2017,4,Great,"Firstly, I would like to warn you of a city tax that we had to pay for our room on arrival at the hotel of which we knew nothing about. This was £45 2 adults and 2 children. A lot of arguing which didn't start the holiday off well!!! Anyway, room basic but big enough for us. Rooms cleaned everyday. Beds very comfy. With a courtyard. Food was plentiful but unfortunately not a great deal for children apart from the snack bar which served freshly made pizza chips, fresh doughnuts and on one day candyfloss. Always plenty to go round. The drink was good, plenty of alcohol that weren't watered down by no means! The animation team worked long hours and did really well with the activities. They never made you do anything. Games from aqua gym, water polo, dates, Boules, football, mini…"
 July 2017,5,Brilliant,Hotel was amazing food was good not 100% staff are always trying to help you. The animation team are 100% the best always helpful get you involved make you feel at home allways friendly with a smile on there faces would definitely go back just because of the animation team massive shout out to them
 July 2017,2,Worst resort I have been to,"One of the most quietest resort i have been to. Checkout was fairly easy and was greeted with a welcome drink. We got shown our rooms before check in. We was on the fourth floor which didn’t have the best view but we didn’t mind. The person who showed us the room kept asking for a tip which we didn’t give and the man got annoyed and left. Room was decent size, the cleaning leaves a lot to be desired, wasn’t impressed at all. Pillows was hard as rock but did provide us with softer ones when requested. There was free safe to use. Rooms was cleaned each day. The location of the hotel was good as it had shops near by where you could buy snacks should you get hungry. Only 30 minutes from airport. The food was terrible on first day which left me worried but dramatically improved…"

 July 2017,4,"Lovely, friendly staff...","Myself and sister came to Agadir for a week of chilling which is what we got. Our room was dated but lovely and clean, we paid for the safe of which we were happy to do so. I think we were lucky after reading some of the reviews left on here...we didn't experience ants, cockroaches or seagulls knocking on out patio door. We were on the 4th (top) floor so maybe that's the best place to be? We like to try different foods and were quite impressed with the Tagines etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful and also the animation team...not pushy at all. The pool area was always clean and looked over by a lifeguard. However, i had last visited Agadir 4yrs ago and since then the resort has changed, it was busy and lively back then but now feels like out of season and neglected. No…"
 July 2017,2,Holiday blues,"Stayed at the les Almoshades beach resort all inclusive, first impressions were fine staff very welcoming upon arrival, the room is ok but could do with a better clean and there is no tea making facilities in the room itself not the four star I would have expected , The food is a bit hit and miss and quite a few dishes went cold very quickly and I found a hair in my soup which put me off quite quickly,the food that is cooked in front of you is better and I would suggest to use it as much as you can, omelette in the morning is a must but I had to buy my own chilli pepper to add to this as there are only a few choices, some staff can be a bit miserable but there are some that go above and beyond to make the holiday nice , Abdul the barman who works in the evening is a top bloke…"
 July 2017,2,The worst holiday I have ever been on,"This was my first trip to Morocco and it is safe to say I will never ever visit again. My fiancé and I travelled to Agadir via Ryanair which was an ordeal in itself, after arriving at the hotel we were greeted at reception and asked if we would like dinner as the restaurant was due to close shortly, on arriving at the restaurant we saw the buffet and found all of the meat to be bones or grizzle with a miss match of sides and picked our way through paella (for me) and oxtail (my fiancé). The following morning we both woke up to find the bedroom infested with ants and I can hand on heart say I have never felt so ill, we proceeded to spend the following 3 days hung over or sat on the toilet and after speaking to the other English guests we found we were not the only ones. After…"
 July 2017,3,"Nice hotel, decent staff however terrible food.",Me and my girlfriend spent ten nights here the hotel it's self is very nice out rooms were nice plenty of activity in the day and evening but however on the alternative end of the spectrum we suffered from upset stomachs the majority of our stay because of the dirty and tasteless food. The food did not taste nice and we felt as no standard of food hygiene was taken into consideration. This hotel also suffers from terrible wifi connection but then again it is free. Overall our stay was great but could of been better in regards to food and staff. My advice to anyone travelling to Agadir - stay away from the company Jumbotours they are cons and cheats. They will be nice to you at the start of your trip because they want you to book excursions which are tripled in price for the…
 June 2017,3,First time to Morocco,We stayed at Les Almohades for 2 weeks as a group of 3. Check in/check out- We had a private transfer from the air port which only took about 30 minutes. There are lots of taxis out side the airport if you haven't booked transport. Negotiate a price before you get in the taxi it should be around 200dirhams. You can't check in to your room until 3pm but there is a secure place to put cases until then. When you arrive you need to pay a city tax per person per night. For us it was around £20 each for the 14 days. You can either exchange the money at reception or just outside about a 3 minute walk is an exchange they both offer about the same rate. On check out you need to vacate the rooms at 12. Around the pool are showers and changing rooms should you have a late flight. …
 June 2017,3,You Get What You Pay For,"We did a weeks all inclusive with friends. The hotel was OK clean and tidy a bit dated but absolutely fine for our needs. The pool area was fine with a snack bar open from 10-5 and serving pizza, chips, donuts and fruit from around 12-4. The main restaurant was OK but the food was definitely lacking to what we are used to - even Marrakesh last year was amazing in comparison so I know its not an issue with Morocco. I am vegetarian and understand that this is always a problem but my meat eating friends were also disappointed with the choice. The main bar was OK but that was the only place to sit and relax with a drink in the evening. Disco Tan Tan opened at 11pm but we didn't go there as it was apparently very hot with no air con and very limited drinks. There were…"
 January 2017,3,Its was okay,"Very clean, staff where friendly ect. Bad side no water/ coffee or tea in the rooms, no wifi in the room and TV was not clear picture. Food was cold and same 3 times a day and every day. Travel rep was hungry for money so best things is to check other travel agency's to gor for trips in agadir there much cheaper and better service than Jambo. What every you do don’t take any trips with Jambo because they only want your money."
 June 2017,5,Lovely stay,"Hotel is lovely we tipped at the start of our holiday and it defiantly paid off few other guests saying staff weren't friendly ect but we did not have this problem in Morocco it's customary to tip they really appreciate it. Rooms well kept not very big but not small by no means, cleaned every day fresh sheets and fresh towels everyday. They come around fairly early depending where you are in the hotel but If you just hang the sign they come later to do clean it. Staff all so friendly night bartender especially funny made our holiday!!! (Picture below) animation team amazing jo abdoul and Nora sooo nice amazing work through Ramadan as well. Waiters alll really friendly table service for drinks in the restaurant I advise you to find a seat first they'll get you drinks then…"
 June 2017,4,Almonds resort agadir,"All in all a great family holiday, resort great, food fantastic, drinks great. Room clean and tidy, animation team were great, staff understanding of English language brilliant, nothing too much trouble, if your polite they are polite and very accommodating. The pools are great, dont know why people complain about them being cold, it's over 30 degrees in the shade it's bound to feel a little cold when you get in, they are very refreshing during this heat. Bad points: check in is a nightmare ( 2/3 hours for us) although not the same for everyone. Jumbo tours rep, avoid him, the man outside the gate much cheaper and friendlier, he charged £20 each for quad biking for 6 plus a visit to a moroccan tea room, which was lovely, jumbo tours rep wanted £75 each and no tea room visit, he…"
 June 2017,5,FAB TIME,"We stayed for 9 nights all-inclusive, i was a little apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews on here. In general the food was good, lots of salads, chicken, lovely fish, and most evenings themed moroccan, italian excellent pizza, french. Ok no burgers of chicken nuggets but i don't eat them at home so i was happy, i will say if your taking fussy children i think they would struggle with the food. Pool area clean and tidy, water very cold, beach area small but nice. Our room was lovely we had asked for a ground floor room and thats what we got, maid service was excellent, cleaned to a high standard, fresh towels daily, and she was always smiling. Animation team fantastic. Naura always made time for a chat, they worked from 10am-1am daily. I can't really…"
 June 2017,4,You get what you pay for...,"I'm currently sat writing this on the balcony of the hotel room and have 3 days left until we fly home. Came here with my fiancé. We were a little apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews but all in all the good does out way the not so good! Our rooms was on the first floor and the balcony faces out on the pool! the beds are super comfy, I did pay for a double room but we have two singles pushed together which doesn't bother us as at the end of the day it's a bed! The hotel grounds are beautiful and are kept clean by the gardeners that go round in the morning. When lit up at night the hotel looks lovely. The pool area is clean but the pool is freezing! People weren't telling porkies when they said it was cold! Plenty of sunbeds round the pool and you get the sun…"
 June 2017,4,Great holiday,"Just come back from a week in Agadir with my partner. Hotel- very quiet but that didn't bother me as there was always somewhere to sit. Bedroom are okay. Bed was comfy didn't seem to get any back pain. Staff- all staff were amazing so polite. Some of the bar staff and kitchen staff don't understand English, they do understand French. The animation staff are so amazing they are polite and so friendly. I don't know how they do all the activities in the heat and while doing Ramadan. All staff work so hard. Entertainment- entertainment in the bar isn't great. Mostly dancing. We did have bingo one night. The disco starts at 10ish till 1am. There was a Moroccon night one night where there was dancing and snake charmers. It was great fun just a little too quiet. Me and my partner…"
 June 2017,3,It was ok,"Went with my daughter for a week. We got what we paid for. Rooms were a nice size but furniture was dated. Beds were super comfy though. We found the staff really friendly, although everyone seems to be in league with each other. Reception staff and concierge found us a taxi one day to go the market. Turned out the market doesn't open on a Monday so ended up at the taxi drivers mates shop! How come reception didn't know that the market was closed? Then the taxi driver shook hands with the receptionist when he brought us back. Hmm... The bar staff were lovely as were the waiters in the restaurant and the cleaners. Food was good and we managed to get merry enough on the all inclusive drinks. The pool was lovely and the animation crew tried hard to get people to join in. Agadir…"
 June 2017,4,Convenient location,"The hotel is situated in a good location just across the road to the beautiful beach ,the local shops and restaurants. At arrival they welcome as very well , check in was quick. The rooms were cleaned every day to the good standards. The food was delicious and good variety, special on Moroccan night. They don't have a lot of entertainment for kids, but animations team was helpful and organised kids mini disco , which was fun for kids. Overall we enjoyed our stay in the hotel."
 May 2017,3,Had a lovely holiday but......,"The hotel is set in very nice grounds ,and we did have a good holiday here but there are a few issues . On arrival there was only one member of staff on reception , with a large number of guests checking in as we all arrived on the same coach , it was very slow ,frustrating and disorganised. The jumbo tours rep was rude and aggressive when we didn't want to come to the his trip meeting , and never told us what time our return transfer to the airport would be, he kept on saying he would tell me later or tomorrow!!! Which never happened. The rooms were fine , the food was fairly good ,Moroccan night was very good . the kids enjoyed the bar snacks of chips , pizza and doughnuts. Not enough tables were set up for tables for 4 or more so nearly every meal we had to ask . The drinks…"
 May 2017,3,Second time in Agadir,Spent a week here. Rooms clean and maid service with a smile daily. Bars poorly stocked and local drinks i.e. spirits and wines are awful! Food was very good and varied compared to our last all inclusive in Agadir and this one was cheaper. Would go back again but beware of all the trip sellers - the hotel should curb that - you expect to get hassled outside but not inside the hotel!
 May 2017,3,Fun Family Holiday- some improvement needed,"arrived back from this hotel yesterday, rated average... we booked with on the beach and our transfer was with Jumbo- watch out for FOUAD, tour guide, he is rude and very pushy to book excursion with him, but truth is you can get it ALOT cheaper just at the back of the hotel from the excursion shop opposite the beach we paid 300 dirhams per bike for quads. Reception- on arrival reception staff are rude, expecting you to know when and where things are- some customer service skills would go along way. when you pay your 'tax' to the hotel make sure get a receipt or take a photo of the book they write in of how much you paid- because upon check out you will be told oh it looks like you have not paid enough tax! RIP OFF, and be expected to pay more before you leave. Rooms- very…"
 May 2017,2,Awful stay in hotel,"The food was disgusting, bland, no seasoning and there wasn't a variety. There was no selection for children at dinner (pizza, burgers, chips etc). Majority of us was forced to go McDonald's for dinner. The table service was atrocious. You have to literally call waiters to clear the tables. There was never glasses or cutlery on the tables too. I'm not sure what the waiters are actually paid to do. The alcohol was weak and cheap. Watered down ridiculously. You can get better value from Tesco Basics. In the my opinion the only thing going for the bar were the two young men who served in the evenings. The rooms looked really nice. However, there were a lot of problems. There was a leak near my door and everytime I would inform the reception, they would just send a cleaner to…"
 May 2017,4,Ticked all the boxes,"I kept an open mind after reading mixed reviews , but we had a very enjoyable relaxed week at this hotel . Room wise , although we had paid more to have a double room , we were presented with a twin . We challenged this, and after being told only 10% of rooms had doubles , they then managed to find us a nicer room position wise and a double bed . This time minus a functioning safe . We didn't pursue this issue. Food wise , lots of variety and freshly prepped . It did become a little repetitive towards the later part of the week . Drinks were good , cocktails all seemed to a variation on cloudy lemon with vodka . Pool although unheated was really pleasant and was spotless . I wouldn't have wanted it any warmer . Staff were all polite and professional . Constantly busy…"
 May 2017,4,Holiday,"Spent a lovely week here. It is not 5star more of a 3+ .In fairness it was a really great hotel. Bit dated but spotless. Food was plenty full, drink was flowing. We normally go 5+ hotels, and I can say, staff were very helpful, animation at night a bit iffy, but all in all I would recommend it. 1 down side, the safe in the rooms are owned by a local company, who the hotel staff will call and they put a card in for about £2 per day."
 May 2017,4,"Good Stay, good hotel!","Visited for 10 days as a couple. Hotel was decent. The rooms were clean. This is an all inclusive hotel. Breakfast from 7-10am, lunch from 12-2:30pm and lunch from 7-10pm. Snack bar open from 12-4:30pm, the bar open from until 10pm. When it comes to food they had a decent choice of food, better than when I stayed in Luxor Egypt. The food was mostly Moroccan based, even when they had different themes per night, but that was fine as the food was very nice. The snack bar was decent, had pizza, chips, chopped fruit and either creps/donuts. The beach is a short walk across the road and has a private area specifically for this hotel, which was decent as you can leave your belongings there as only guest were allowed in that area. The beach is very nice and the water is warm and not…"
 May 2017,4,Pleasant stay in a beautiful resort,"We visited Almohades for 5 nights and we were quite satisfied on everything during our stay. Our room was well cleaned every day and excluding the maids cleaning times (8am at worst) the rooms were peaceful. Our room had a terrace to Moroccan garden, which was terrific. Food is overall very good and you find something you feel like eating everytime. They had themes changing on most evenings and we especially enjoyed the Moroccan theme (they serve Moroccan dishes on every meal, don't worry) and afternoon snack was very well taken care of by the snackbar right next to the pool. Big respect for the staff at lounge bar and pool bar. They were very professional, polite and kind at all times even tho somebody was ordering a huge load of alcohol in russian, for example. The poolbar…"
 May 2017,2,Hmmmm....,"When we arrived the hotel looked lovely and the people were very friendly. As the week has gone by my views have change dramatically. Rooms- They are OK very basic. We paid for a room for 3 people what we got was a double room and a fold up bed there was hardly any room to walk around. Had a fridge, hairdryer, bath and over shower. Balcony was a good size tho. Cleanliness of room - The rooms are cleaned daily or so we thought. Mostly all they have done is made the beds and emptied the ashtray. The floor is stinking. The towels have only been changed once. The toilet had broken (not flushing) everyday. We had to call maintenance to have this sorted. And they have taken a bag of my daughters with sweets and her colouring books. One night we had a henna tattoo which marked 2…"
 May 2017,4,Better than I expected,"Stop moaning people. We r in Africa and hotel is very good. Hotel grounds look very pretty. Rooms r cleaned every day. Hot water in the shower. Menu a little boring when you stay longer than a week, but still not bad. They serve snacks by the pool during day (hot donuts r sooo good) so is cocktails! Coffee is great too. I was amazed how good the waiters were, helpful and wanted to please, although it's all inclusive and no one tipped them. Whoever says they r rude-maybe they should give bar staff a smile before ordering and finish a sentence with simple ""please and thank you"" for better experience. A special thank you for older man called Larbi who show us to our room (although he been told we had no cash on us to tip him) he made sure we r comfortable and even organised a…"
 April 2017,2,Disappointing visit,"Our visit to the hotel probably, unfortunately coincided with the Taekwondo African championships- not that it alone affected the holiday but the hotel was the main hotel for the contestants - so the pool lacked ""people watching"" experience and the contestants went to bed early! We had issues with the safe and, as it was supported by an external company - the member of staff on reception in the evening- really couldn't care less - he was the worst member of staff The concierge were excellent - both guys - tried to make the experience great The balcony experience wasn't good as it was an open balcony (see photos) A few times we walked along the promenade- this was a few minutes away from the hotel Unfortunately wouldn't return"
 May 2017,4,Good for the money a few little bits could be improved,"Stayed here for a week at the start of May! The hotel itself is lovely but a few things are lacking! The evening entertainment is so poor so don't expect a lot in that sense! I can confirm the pool is freezing takes a while to get used to it. The animation team worked hard all week to be fair but didn't tell us about the only evening they had entertainment that week, so we missed out! I found the food okay but not amazing not much choice on a couple of evenings. I found the lunch better than the dinner on most days. Don't expect to see many British at this hotel either. I found the bar staff rather rude on occasions which was a disappointment as most of the other staff were great. Just being honest. Overall you get what you pay for I suppose. Don't expect to much and you will be…"

 April 2017,4,Good hotel,"Just got back from a 10 night stay at this resort. The setting is very nice... 2 minutes from the promenade and beach... has its own 'private' area on the beach. Food was quite good... pretty good variety... works on a different theme 3-4 day cycle... Rooms are not exactly luxurious.... but clean and generally well kept... Staff are generally extremely helpful and will try to cater for whatever you need... The animation team, people like Abdul and Nora... very good... One thing though... remember English is not their first language and sometimes you need to be patient... we are guests in their country.... so we should try make an effort... Facilities on resort are good.... You can do as much, or as little as you want. Generally well recommended and a good place to…"
 March 2017,4,Lovely hotel with amazing staff and value for money!,"Spent a lovely 5 nights here at the beginning of March. Location was great, literally a two minute walk from the beach and even had its own section on the beach as well! I cannot praise the staff enough for their efforts in making you feel welcome. Very warming and friendly! The entertainment team were especially amazing, they really went out of their ways to try and ensure that everyone was involved and included in the activities!! The hotel grounds were very beautiful, especially at night time when all the gardens are lit up and around the pool area. Only reason I have awarded 4 stars as opposed to 5 is due to the pool, which was really quite small and freezing cold! :( But all in all, great hotel with absolutely lovely staff which was really good value for money. Would…"
 April 2017,4,Great hotel with no complaints,"The hotel itself was, in my opinion, incredible. If staying on hotel premises during the day, you can choose between the privately-owned section of the beach where it is very peaceful with sunloungers and umbrellas available. Or you have the pool with plenty of seats (note: renovation is completed, in previous photos where there are sun loungers on the grass, these are now concreted platforms). I agree with previous reviews that the pool was freezing cold, however I only felt this after sunbathing as my body was hot. When I hadn't been in the sun, it was lovely for a swim. The Animation Team around the pool were also great; they were very welcoming and kind and did not hassle you to join in with games and exercises which occur throughout the day at the pool. A special shoutout…"
 April 2017,5,Lovely lil hotel,"Me and my partner stayed 1 week and had a really nice relaxing time. Staff were polite, friendly, professional and respectful from reception bar and restaurant staff. Only person that wasn't very warm was the excursions guy blaitantly just sees a money sign above your head and overcharged us. We was pleasantly suprised with the variety of the food and enjoyed the choices available. Alcohol is abit runbish but we got a bottle in duty free that was more than enough. You are near enough to bars and restaurants and clubs. We ate at the restaurant behind the hotel near the beach. Looks really lovely in the evening with fires burning outside and the food was delicious. Overall we were very pleased with our stay it was a relaxing and quiet time. It would of been nice if there was…"
 April 2017,4,A lovely stay - Hotel review and general tips.,"I have just returned home after staying here for a fabulous 7 nights, with my son and two friends. The location is perfect. Only half hour drive from the airport and with a good range of bars, restaurants and shops very close by. We felt safe and comfortable during the entire stay. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. Generally, staff are friendly and helpful. We had rooms on the 2nd floor, with lovely big balconies and views over the pool area. The rooms have air-con and very comfy beds. The bathroom is a good size and the shower is powerful. Rooms were thoroughly cleaned daily with fresh towels every day. You have to pay extra to be able use the room safe. I'm not sure it is worthy of a 4* status, as it was basic accommodation, but there were no complaints either. The…"
 April 2017,3,Average hotel,"I have recently returned from a 7 night stay at the Les Almohades Resort. The hotel in my opinion is not of a 4* standard especially when compared to other 4* hotels in the area. On arrival we were greeted at Reception with a drink and were quickly checked in. I'm not overly fussy when it comes to rooms, as long as it is clean it does not bother me however I did expect bottles of water and a functioning safe both of which we did not get. Our rooms were always cleaned by the maid who was very friendly and lovely to us during out stay. I didn't have very high standards when it came to food as hotel food is never exceptional but I was disappointed at the lack of variety and options. Sometimes the food was undercooked especially the eggs at breakfast. However I really enjoyed…"
 April 2017,1,Don't bother better hotels in agadir,"We travelled in a large group, once we arrived at the hotel around 8pm check in took nearly two hours, although we were in a large group understandably it would take a while but two hours is unacceptable as the hotel was aware of our arrival time. Nothing in the room worked properly including the locks to the bathroom and all the other rooms my family were checked into were the same, upon complaining to reception nothing was really done about it, no surprise there! Cleaning the rooms was non existent, there was always several days the cleaner didn't clean my room or change the towels which then had to call reception and wait around in my room for someone to turn up. The last thing you would want to be doing on your holiday, the hotel does not have any spa or gym facilities…"
 April 2017,3,Average hotel,"Stayed here with family, hotel was ok but not 4* at best it's 3* staff at hotel are very nice and friendly especially the staff who works at night (forgot his name) hotel food is standard nothing special just about edible. The bar is great were you get unlimited drinks. Hotel is not far from the beach 2min walk. If your thinking of doing excursion please don't use the hotel rep they charge you double for example we went quad bike paid 250dm he was charging us 350dm he will try and put you off by saying they are not reliable trust me all of these use the same excursion. If I was to go back to agadir I probably stay at a different hotel as mentioned this is not a 4* but one thing I give this hotel is this family friendly."
 April 2017,5,Great Place to visit,"Just got back from a week long family holiday of 27 persons. The Hotel is very clean and staff are very attentive, word of advice don't book any excursions with the hotel reps Rashid/Abdul..they charge 3 times the going rate! And if you go with a different operator they tend to scare you buy saying bad service etc. We did quad biking 250dhms - Quoted 350dhm by rep, Massage/Hammam 2hrs 200dhm - Quoted 350dhms.. Paradise Valley, CrocPark. I suggest you DO NOT exchange currency upon landing in the 2 exchanges after baggage collection, 1dhm more as soon as you pass them! Buy a local operator sim card 40-50dhm inclusive of data. Food is good as part of the All inclusive package plenty on offer Call or whatsapp Khadija for excursions, she is cheaper but do still bargain with her…"
 February 2017,5,Great time in Agadir,"We stayed here in February, all 7 days sunshine and warm. All inc means you have a selection of really good food to choose from, and fresh scrambled eggs in the morning. Room were decent, exactly what you can expect. Staff was helpfull and organised. Entertainment team was wonderful, they did amazing job."
 March 2017,5,Excellent Hotel and Value for Money,"We stayed here at the beginning of March after researching somewhere short haul that would be warm at this time of year and definitely weren't disappointed! The main points are... Staff and Entertainment Team - the staff were helpful and friendly, especially the barman at the evening bar and Ahmed the entertainer! The entertainment team were amazing at including everybody in their activities, yet leaving you alone if you didn't want to be as involved. They spoke many languages, and if more than one nationality was taking part in an activity, they had no problem speaking in all languages necessary. They also remembered your name! Hotel - The hotel was very clean and the food and drink areas were constantly cleared, tidied and stocked up. We enjoyed the food, which was always…"
 March 2017,5,"Fabulous Hotel, Staff and Food","Went to Agadir and stayed in Les Almohades Beach Hotel for a 10 day break in early March 2017. Not only was it very inexpensive for all inclusive, the hotel room and hotel overall was clean and bright with lots of pool area for relaxing and sunbathing. They also provides chairs by the beach which is not far. The staff was very helpful and polite and the meals every day, was different with a variety, including salads and soups. They have what is called ""Animation Team"" that provided entertainment for guest and they are absolutely lovely people. I highly recommend this hotel as someone who appreciates good quality service."
 April 2017,4,Good all round place,"Hotel was nice and clean with friendly staff. We arrived at the hotel at around 9:30pm and were told to go to the restaurant for food as it closes at 10:00pm and can check in afterwards. The hotel garden and swimming pool areas were clean. No issues with the rooms, were cleaned on a daily basis. The food in the restaurant for me personally was a bit hit and miss but overall there was something for everyone. If you are a big eater, then the food may not hit the right note for you every day, but some days it was very nice. Snack bar available throughout the day serving pizza, chips and a couple of other items, also drink too. The hotel has a tennis court and a 6 side football pitch. Location wise it is good, literally 2/3 minute walk to the beach from the back entrance of the…"
 April 2017,3,You get what you pay for...,"Overall the hotel is good. And is a high 3* due to services, location, food/beverages and cleanliness. The rooms are furnished fairly well, but have evidence of a cheap tidy up rather than the advertised recent refurb, this is evident throughout the hotel with a general tired look. The hotel is located very well in Agadir, being only a 2 minute walk to the 6km promenade and sandy beach, and 15 minute walk into the main tourist areas. If you wish to go to the Souk/market by foot it's well recommended with a short walk (you will catch a locals eye, and they'll lead you there for a simple visit to their brothers/dads/uncles/friends stall 😉) Food in the restaurant is fairly varied, although during our week there were repeats of same dishes, herbed slightly differently, with a…"

 April 2017,3,Our holiday march 2017,"Hotel lovely with clean rooms and towels daily. Pool very cold. Staff were fantastic, very frendly. Entertainment not so good. Need more things for familys to do.Food could be better. More catering for the British would be good. More variety needed. Not much for children to eat, especially if they are young. Or fussy. Not one ice cream in the ten days we were there. !!! You couldn't complain about the weather though it was really hot between 24 - 33 dec all the time. You just need to be weary of the lookie,lookie men always trying to sell you something on the promenade. They don't leave you alone. !!!"
 March 2017,5,Best holiday,Well what can I say we had 10 day at Les almohades hotel it was one of the best holiday We have very had the hotel was clean the staff was lovely friendly the food was lovely some think for ever one we when with on the beach and our rep fouad was amazing he was there twice-A-Day and came and made sure every think was okay and for that we'd like to thank him we will be back next year 👍🐫🌞

 March 2017,5,Wall to wall blue sky,"Can't fault this hotel, so clean and well looked after. Just had five nights and had stunning weather every single day, slight chill early mornings but still ate breakfast outside in the sun. Sun roasting by 11am. Food excellent, wonderful salad bar, fresh pizza at snack bar and drinks plentiful!! All inc drinks served until 11pm then the disco opens and more drinks til 1am when we stumbled into bed each night! Two minutes walk to beautiful beach and amazing prom to stroll down. Turn right and head to marina and shops, happy to find a Zara! Agadir is a great place and would definitely recommend this hotel."

 March 2017,3,"Good, but not a 4* in my opinion","We travelled to Les Almohades Beach Resort for a week of winter sun. It's in a great location. We booked through On the Beach Holidays. In general the holiday was good, restaurant staff, animation team, bar staff, room maids were lovely and polite, couldn't do enough for you, however some reception staff were a bit rude and unhelpful!! Seagulls are a problem at the hotel, you'll be wakened at the crack of dawn with them screeching especially if you have one of the rooms looking on to the small garden courtyard area (room 226). The pool area was great, plenty of sun beds at all times of the day, I expect it was due to it being low season, may be a bit different in high season when the hotel is fully booked. The food was ok, not a great selection some days, I'm not a fussy…"
 March 2017,4,"Brilliant place, great food and good staff.","Came here for 5 days wth my boyfriend for my birthday. The hotel itself is very clean and well kept. The buffet food, for which I was slightly concerned about with regards to the other reviews. I don't know what they were talking about. The food is amazing!! Such choice and amazing taste. The drinks selection is a little narrow but covers the basics. The staff are really lovely and always have something going on. Getting the customers up and doing things. For a longer holiday this is great however for a short break where you want to chill it can be annoying when trying to relax. But taking that aside they are all lovely and friendly. The final note is we were the youngest couple here by quite a far stretch, and I struggled a very little bit with the language difference, however…"
 March 2017,5,Great Holiday and Hotel,"The Hotel is in a great location on the centre of the Promenade just over the road from the private beach. The whole hotel is spotless, all areas beautifully kept and the gardens very pretty. The rooms are clean and functional with comfortable beds and great showers. The private beach is really nice and hassle free, you can leave things on the sun bed and swim with no worries that anyone will take them. The pool area is really nice but the pool is freezing, you have to be brave but it is nice when you get in. The food was great always something nice to eat and lots of lovely Moroccan Tagines and flavours. The best thing about the Hotel is the staff, everyone is so friendly and helpful.

Great food well cooked and very tasty at every meal. Beds were the most comfortable i have ever slept in not your usual hard rubbish. Rooms cleaned and towels changed every day. Beer was very nice but limited amount of spirits. Very good WiFi in bar/reception/pool bar and restaurant and in rooms near reception.."
 March 2017,5,Wonderful!,"Firstly, the animation team.. Jo, Zahira, Sana, Fedel, Achmed and Dembar were absolutely amazing! So full of energy and helpful, loads to do in the day (but they also leave you alone if you don't want to join in too!) They all went above and beyond, especially Jo to make sure we had a brilliant time! Abdul the bar man was another one of our favourites! The food was great, as a vegetarian I often struggle abroad but found plenty to eat at every meal! Rooms were lovely and clean and we really enjoyed the movie channel on the telly all day/night!

Loads of shops, clubs, bars and restaurants within walking distance from…"
 March 2017,4,Relaxing,Hotel is in an excellent location just 2 mins out of the back of the hotel to the beach. Own cordoned area with chairs. Promenade is great to just stroll along about 25 min walk all the way to the marina. A few shops but mostly hotels and restaurants. Not too much hassling from vendors but watch out for the kids with flowers they do pester you. Short walk to bird park and centre of town. Visit to the souk is a must but be prepared for haggling. Hotel is very clean and staff very friendly. Animation team are great just a shame they have to work so hard to get people involved. Not many guests staying at the moment but that means plenty of sun beds and pool gets the sun all day. Pool is cold.... that was a disappointment although other reviews had said it is not heated as is…
 March 2017,5,Agadir - Almohades Beach Resort,"This Hotel is a privately run hotel, staff are very friendly; the buffet food selection was good; generally I don't like spicy food, but their cuisine was absolutely delicious - and every night, they had a different country food theme. The sandy beach is fabulous, which is just over the road, the hotel has lovely clean swimming pool(s) too. The rooms are generous with a balcony - I do recommend this relaxing and all inclusive hotel."
 March 2017,5,Winter sun,"This was my first visit to Morocco and we loved it. The hotel was great. Amazing staff especially the little porter man and Abdula in the Lobby bar. They were always helpful and polite. The animation team were exceptional and they kept us entertained through our holiday especially Ahmed, Jo and Fidel who even gave me a birthday cake and candle 😃 The hotel was very clean and the food was delicous. Looking forward to our next visit to the hotel....😀"
 February 2017,4,Tips for visiting This hotel and Morocco in general,"I stayed in this hotel for one week. The staff was very friendly, especially bar tenders. The entertainment - almost nothing although I wasn't looking for that so it was not a bad thing. 1. Make sure to have a pen with you when going Morocco as at the airport you will have to fill out a form, very simple although impossible without a pen :P 2. DO NOT EXCHANGE money in the first currency exchange place that you see (there are two next to each other) as when you walk out from that part there are a lot of other places there still in the airport building with a lot better rates. Hotel rates - not too bad. 3. Safe is in each room - but you have to pay them to use it - 175 dh per week. No one will tell you that, you will think the safe is broken, they will bring engineer in and charge…"
 February 2017,3,Mother and daughter holiday,"Had a lovely week, lovely hotel with lovely staff. Enjoyed the entertainment offered by the hotel staff and food was fabulous. Booked our excursions through jumbo tours with Fouad, we did a camel ride, Agadir 1/2 day tour and a trip to Marrakech ( Marrakech was definitely an experience and being a young girl I was so grateful to have a tour guide looking after our group of 5 lady's, it was a bit daunting, but I felt safer having the tour guide around he was very knowledgeable). Overall We had a lovely week away."
 February 2017,5,"Forget Winter at this Safe, Spotless, Sunny Sanctuary...... with Scrabble too!!","My wife and I went for an all inclusive week...Feb/March 2017 to escape Winter and we found: Location. Ideally close to lovely beach with dedicated hotel area with attendant. Step out of back gate over road onto the promenade, but the hotel's own pools are secluded from breeze from the sea. Clean clean clean in room and all communal areas. Meticulous and constant staff attention to all cleaning. Room. spacious and very comfortable beds. Full sized bath..excellent constant hot water. BBC and CNN news in English on TV. Problems. Instant response.

Manager checked all was well. We…"
 March 2017,4,Nice quiet holiday,"We are still here, so it will be a quick review. The hotel is a nice hotel, perhaps (if being a bit critical) could do with a bit of an overhaul, but generally very tidy and presentable. The staff are very polite and helpful, especially the porter, who simply cannot do enough for you (he will accept a tip though! But doesn't wait around for one - I had to call him back to give him a tip one night) the bar men are nice and polite, if not on the ""smelly"" side - they need to be introduced to deodorant, but there again, end of February/beginning of march, its is really warm , even though they call it their winter!! . The rooms are very neat and tidy, equipped with all the bare essentials, tv, fridge, a tidy size en suite and a free safe ( fair play the Spanish, Turkish and others…"
 February 2017,4,Winter sun in Agadir,"As the English winter had depleted our supplies of vitamin ""D"" my wife and I decided to visit Morocco as it was a place that we had never been to before. Seeing that it was a former Ramada hotel we chose Les Almohades solely on that name alone. Our flight from Gatwick was early in the morning and meant that we arrived in Agadir in daylight. Fortunately we are in the same time zone so there was no need to alter watches forward or back. This always confuses me anyway. The transfer from the aerodrome took about an hour and we were soon enjoying a welcome drink as we booked in to our room. As we are both slightly disabled the hotel had arranged for us to have a room on the ground floor. This also meant that we were on the same level as the restaurant and also gave us access to the…"
 January 2017,4,"Clean, Clean and Clean some More","Travelled with my Wife and our 2 friends for our annual winter holiday (as Canaries too pricy and Sharm still closed for business) Got some nice cheap EasyJet flights out of Gatwick, and nice flight times too (07.30 out and 11.40 back). Nice reasonably short flight, and then on to the turmoil of the airport in Agadir. First of all, take a pen as you have to fill in immigration forms and have them perused (in great and lengthy detail) from the Police. This whole excerise took about 1 hours (including baggage pick up). Another point worth mentioning is that the their currency is ""closed"" meaning that you can cannot get cash before you go. There are cashpoints and exchange bureaus at the airport, and money exchange is quite painless (hotel does it also). Trip to the hotel is…"
 February 2017,5,Disabled travellers please read my review,"I have MS and travelled on my own in a wheelchair yes it was very scary not knowing what to expect thats why I feel its important that I write this. I won't be naming staff and saying they looked after me because EVERY member of staff gave me 100% respect and help where needed if it was there job to do so or not so to all staff you get a massive THANK YOU from me. The hotel is I would say 95% disable friendly with ramps throughout the hotel and pool area although some are a bit steep to be on your own in a manual wheelchair but because there is staff all over the hotel its only seconds before you get a friendly push,the only areas with steps are the inside bar (there is still plenty of seats on ground level) and the inside dining area but as food was the same inside as outside…"
 September 2016,3,Easy and fun,"For the ones who appreciate authentic atmosphere, oriental spirit and fun experience that hotel has it all to a relatively hight degree. Nicely located close to the beach with very easy access to it without the noise of the very busy boardwalk.Still there is a little more to be done as far as the hygiene and the service are concerned"
 February 2017,5,Great winter break,"We arrived late due to delays at the airport. The restaurant was due to close so we were told to go and eat before checking in. The Hotel is in a great location, close to the beach, restaurants and shops. The hotel has its own private beach with plenty of sunbeds (Not as comfortable as those in the hotel) Walking along the promenade you will see sand sculptures on the beach and sellers who love you to haggle with them. The staff in the hotel are very friendly and the animation team all work very hard. They organise activities around the pool each day and are always happy to stop and have a chat. The hotel buildings and gardens are lovely and clean and the pools were clean but the water was very cold (Not heated as stated) The buffet restaurant had a reasonable selection at…"
 January 2017,3,Winter break,"On the whole we had a good week weather was good and no problems getting a sunbed although animation team could be annoying at times when you just wanted to relax!!. Staff were all very polite and we're helpful if you needed any information. Room was clean and tidy although we were below the bar, room 222 so beware very noisy at night. Hotel was in an ideal location close to all amenities and the local petite taxis cost literally pennies to get anywhere of distance i.e souk. Just make sure they put the meter on before you get in or they will charge you what they like!!!!.....on the whole the hotel was kept spotless the only downfall for us was the food....barely kept warm....limited choices.....for a 4* hotel for all inclusive we felt was not upto standard and let the hotel…"
 January 2017,3,Not so 4*,"Me and my husband visited this hotel in January for a romantic break. On arrival we were met by some frosty staff, the Porter showed us to our room which was ant infested so we were moved to a room with twin beds which was not ideal. After some complaining we got a room with a double bed and which was much larger, the only downside was the shower pipe leaked and the toilet flush was faulty. We reported these but they were never fixed during our stay. The hotel itself is lovely and clean and well presented. The restaurant has a limited but tasty buffet. I'm not sure if it was because we went out of season but the entertainment was lacking and a bit stale. There wasn't much to do in the evenings in the hotel, there wasn't a single TV in the lobby for guests to watch, the disco was…"
 February 2017,5,Little Gem,"I've read other reviews on here and can only think that people want to keep this place to themselves, food is good, not a lot of choice - but still very good, the animation team make the holiday, Charaf, Kiwi, Abdullah and Abeer - fantastic, Muhammed in the restaurant, Abdullah, (Anim - little cutie, big smiles all day long) and his team in the bar, all of the concierge staff, all so caring, the cleaners and everyone else, I can't recommend this hotel enough - pools are cold though, everywhere is spotless, pools are well maintained and the sunbeds are very good, not the crap ones that fold up when you sit on them. The restaurant could do with a bit of organisation, it would be nice to be taken to a table and have all the cutlery present, it would be great if the…"
 February 2017,5,One week stay:)!,"Me and my partner stayed at this hotel on the 31st Jan-7th Feb. Out weeks holiday was brilliant we both really enjoyed it spoke to others when we was there who also couldn't fault the hotel. Location was brilliant near the beach restaurants and shops! Staff we do attentive and always willing to help thy printed out boarding pass off for us and just out it in our room whilst we was down near pool, as well as decorating our room with petal and vase of flowers for my partners birthday! Food was lovely did different country foods nights e.g. Moroccan,French,BBQ night,Italian and more.modern hotel, activities throughout day around the pool and snacks running through the day! LOVED IT And net some lovely people. Would definitely recommend!:):):):):):)"
 February 2017,4,Miss,We stayed at this resort for 5 nights with our 4 month baby. I can not fault the hotel although bathroom can be a bit updated. Every staff members were very helpful and superb. We will defernately return.
 January 2017,4,Great animation team,"We arrived 17 till the 31st of Jan, we found the hotel very clean and staff very friendly. Rooms were nice no wifi in rooms and only 3 English channels. Pool was freezing to the point nobody was swimming! Food was nice but a little repetitive after a week. Animation team were great , kids really loved them!! We did realise this is more of an old people's hotel with more 60+ which made evening entertainment like an old people's home. We met some great people who we will miss. Beach was 2 min walk away, this hotel is situated in a great place. Great staff in whole hotel!!"
 January 2017,4,good hotel in a tourist erea of Agadir,"A really good hotel with nice and helpfull staff in the bar / restaurant erea,and when you approach the reception-staff with a smile they also are willing to help you. The lay-out of the hotel is great and it is build in two different buildings of 4 levels <block a and b the topfloor of a and the two topfloors of be have some sea view. The swimming-pool is on an lower level than the ground floor so it is out of the wind [ good for the out of season sunbathing ] and has lots of good sunloungers ( no shadow of the building ) and a NON reservation policy +++++. The restaurant is a seperate building with 3 dinning ereas and an outside smoking area in the morning sun ( after 08.30 ). Very good selection for bereakfast and eggs as you wish made on the spot and every day a different…"
 January 2017,4,I can only echo all the other reviewers !!,"Pronounced ' Layze Al Mo Had' - 'tis French !! If you don't get it right a taxi driver could take you to a very similarly-named hotel instead !! I think all the other reviews say it all. We stayed 7-21 January 2017, on our third visit to Agadir. We estimated hotel occupancy at about 10-15%. About 60-70 people in 321-bedded hotel. During the first week almost everyone was French and we did feel sidelined, but then it is a French-speaking country !! The second week it was almost entirely English, and changed its character. Location, food, cleanliness, staff, security - all excellent. Children will struggle with food. Pool VERY cold - managed two swims, husband one, in two weeks ! Last year Founty Beach had heated pool . . . Animation team try too hard - we wanted peace…"
 January 2017,4,Really good stay in a great hotel.,"Just returned from a weeks trip. Made the booking after reading some really good reviews. OK so, lets do the bad stuff that personally, lets the place down only a bit. Check-in - Simple and quick but immediately you are checked in you are ""handed over"" to an independent JumboTours travel/tours rep. I was totally annoyed about this. All I wanted was to get to my room. I did not want some 10-15min sales pitch on trips and then the insistence i ""meet"" at 10am the next day. Well. I didn't. Ok of you are brainless and cant work out how to do anything yourself but come on! Straight after check-in please! Check out - On the day I left i was totally annoyed with the bell boys ""insistence"" to ""help arrange"" my return car to the airport. Of course its all for back handers. Course …"
 January 2017,5,Fantastic visit!,"Staff are so friendly. Even the security say hello! Lovely place. Good sized and clean room. Animation and bar staff always looking after you. Find the waiter called Mouhamed as he speaks great English. Fantastic food breakfast lunch and dinner. Couldn't fault the place. There's a previous review about a rep called Ahmed on here. We did book some trips with him the first night and all was okay but he's all business. Better off finding Noureddine as he's so friendly! He even got candles and cake for my partners birthday. Hotel is right on the promenade. 30 mins walk to the marina along the prom. Everyone in Agadir were so friendly! I felt very safe, plenty of police and army about. Taxi to souk is £1.80. We'll be back!"
 January 2017,5,Great place!,"We stayed 14th-21st January and had an awesome holiday. The room was nice (and cleaned every day) the food was excellent, lots of variety and a different theme every day, though I think children would find it difficult if they are fussy eaters. The pool and gardens lovely, and the entertainment team were fantastic! Made to feel very welcome and they get everyone involved. Special thanks to Ahmed, Samaira, Joel? (The DJ), Kavi, Abir and Abdul the bartender, you all made our holiday memorable! Julie & Lee"
 January 2017,5,Get away for new year,This hotel was stunning and very clean. The staff were all very friendly and nothing too much trouble. The pool area was very well cleaned and maintained and everywhere was easy to access. The hotel does have its own beach area just outside and across the road but make sure you find the hotels sun loungers or you maybe charged. The food in the restaurant was served as s buffet style but there was always a great variety of choice. The waiting staff were very friendly and attentive. The restaurant did have themed nights and it was always very clean. The hotel is in a good prime seafront location and I'd highly recommend this place. We are planning on returning for next new years eve.
 January 2017,4,Nice Resort,"A friend and I spent a week here in January. It was a lovely, perfect location - so close to the beach yet enough of a distance to avoid the crazy busy tourist spots. The shops and markets are very close as well. The facilities were nice, and the food was delicious. The pool was much too cold to enjoy, but it will be nice in warmer months! The Moroccan Tea Room was closed, so we were a bit disappointed! There was always something going on with gym classes, dance lessons, the disco tan tan as well. The staff were extremely friendly as well. They always had a smile on their face and went above and beyond to help us. I will admit, it was a bit overwhelming at times. It was hard to have some peace and quiet by the pool or in the bar area as we were constantly approached by…"
 December 2016,5,christmas holiday,The hotel is beautiful very clean and the staff in all areas of the hotel are very helpful and friendly I was there for the christmas with my family we all had a lovely time Rooms were cleaned daily The only down fall on the trip adviser it said heated pool but when asking the life guard he informed us there were no heated pools are only heated by the sun
 December 2016,5,Relax,one of the best in Town. a very nice place. i am here and the Hotel is very top. be sure i will coming again on this place because the friendly people (Service). This is what i need in my Holidays. Thx
 December 2016,4,Relaxing holiday,"Booked the hotel from UK without any prior knowledge so unsure what to expect. Upon arrival hotel looked nice and clean from outside. Room was clean and regularly maintained (we had a really lovely chambermaid) with a huge terrace overlooking pool. Also had bath which we like. The restaurant is buffet style, whilst initially we had reservations due to size comparison of other hotels it was variable in menu with cultural diversity of other regions especially what seemed Caribbean and central/south America. The range of tagines on offer was impressive (better than previous hotels in Morocco) and there were themed nights both culinary and dress wise. Staff in every dept are friendly attentive and hard working. Our regular waiter mohammed was very professional and friendly,…"
 November 2016,5,Fabulous week,"First visit to Morocco and definitely not my last. Everything at this hotel was excellent and great value for money. My friend and I felt we'd hit the jackpot. All staff were polite and friendly and most patient when I practised my French. Effort was made each evening with differently themed suppers and entertainment. The Moroccan one was so good and not to be missed. One night I dined alone as my friend felt unwell. The staff were especially helpful and put me at ease. The hotel was clean and staff could be seen constantly maintaining it to a high standard. The beach was across the road and sunbeds are available. Swimming was good both in the pools and beach, although I did find the current strong. The beach is vast, wonderful. The hotel is well placed for walking into town…"
 November 2016,5,relaxing time,my partner and i stayed here 29/11/16 for a week and we found the hotel to be a great place to stay very friendly staff were very polite and helpful the hotel was spotless daily room cleaning and a very good animation team that work there the 3 lads who we saw the most were very entertaining and made sure the guest had the right information and made the guest feel welcome and not ackward for different lifestyles the animation team deserves 10/10 for making guests feel welcome not just to me and my partner but other guest that we met there a very god time had 10/10 customer service a great place to stay looking forward to going back
 November 2016,5,Lovely Hotel with fab staff,"My partner and I stayed here for a week at the end of November. When you check on you have to pay City Tax, this was 123 Moroccan Dirham which is about £10. The rooms were spacious all with a balcony or terrace. The maid came every morning during our stay with fresh bedding/towels etc. The buffet restaurant caters for everyone! There was a lot to choose from and every night they would do different themes. Only downfall was that the food was sometimes only warm but we still enjoyed the food very much. During the afternoon the snack bar by the pool would serve soft drinks/alcohol/cocktails as well as freshly made pizzas. The main bar was by reception, you could sit inside or chill on the balcony overlooking the pool area. The pool and grounds were beautiful, the hotel was…"
 December 2016,5,Amazing,"Flew out to Agadir on the 29th Nov with my 3 year old and friend. The hotel is 30 mins away from the airport. I was a bit skeptical reading the latest reviews but have to say we had a lovely time here. Absolutely amazing. The staff were really friendly and always smiling and just so helpful. Animation team are also very lovely and always checked you were ok. The hotel is very clean and the room was the perfect size with a huge balcony. The food was amazing first time away and i really enjoyed the food. The beach is literally right next to the hotel walking distance so take your towels and suncream and spend time there as it is so beautiful. I spent the mornings and evenings in the sea with my 3 year old and she loved it. The hotel staff always ensuring to do the best for you,…"
 November 2016,2,Not impressed,"We visited this resort in November and booked it last minute, when we arrived at the hotel before we had even checked in we were greeted by a member of the animation team who sat us down for 20 minutes to show us a list of prices and trips that he could arrange. I felt he was quiet assertive then told us to book something then and there after he had shown us pictures and prices we declined to make a decision then and there and he got up in a huff, the staff at reception barely spoke English and I found them rude and obnoxious they also got annoyed with us when we were speaking because they didn't understand and ushered us away. The bar staff were also very rude and has no idea how to make cocktails we asked for a Caprihnia and a daiquiri and both got vodka with lemon cordial. We…"
 November 2016,4,2nd time,This is the 2nd time my partner and i have visited Agadir and not much has changed in the 3 years between visits. Id put the hotel as 3+ for rating. It was spotlessly clean in the public areas and the staff and animation team were friendly welcoming and always on hand to help. Our first night after arriving very late we asked the old porter (i forget his name) where we could go to get cigarettes... he offered to go and get them for us! I was a little sceptical at first as we gave him money but he did come back and every day after asked of we needed more! Nothing was too much of an effort here. The pool is freezing which is a shame as a little heat would have increased my rating. The food.. well as my partner doent eat in the hotels we stay in there is little to comment. I ate…
 November 2016,5,Fantastic hotel,"We visited almohades this November and had a superb holiday. The resort of agadir was perfect, lots of shops and souks to explore, friendly people,and a beautiful beach. The hotel itself fully deserved its 4 stars, it was always spotlessly clean and tidy. The gardens were beautiful and well maintained, the pool area was fantastic with plenty of sun beds and umbrellas available. The food was a good standard with always plenty of choices. The theme nights were good especially the Moroccan night ,with plenty of lovely tagines to try. As I vegan I always found plenty of food to have and the staff were always accommodating( cooking fresh pizzas with veg and without cheese on request was a nice touch ) The food was always fresh and hot. The snack bar during the day was good and the…"
 November 2016,4,"Another great resort, but...","This is a great, clean and green resort with three middle size pools and several entertainment facilities. At time of writing, the animation team is in middle of shift over so nothing is organised, though they do their best. The food is of a reasonable quality and diverse, but I found it tasteless, or maybe that is the way they prepare it. The rooms are clean and nice but expect to get your shampoo and shower gel with you. The reception personal are friendly, multilingual and helpful. The snack bar, lobby bar are both of a great standard and service personal. The hotel have got a theatre for shows and a small disco with own bar for late swings. The location of the hotel is really close to the beach and the main entertainment vain of Agadir. This resort has a great potential to…"
 November 2016,5,Perfect family holiday,I don't normally write reviews but the amazing SERVICE from every member of staff has to mentioned!!! This was my first holiday with my baby and I was very nervous about how it will go. But from the moment we got to the resort everyone was so helpful and welcoming. The porter who took our luggage to the receptionist who booked us into the house keeping staff. Literally everyone was so helpful and friendly. The hotel has beautiful grounds that are super clean. The restaurant staff was so amazing and helpful. They had live cooking areas that served fresh pancakes and omelettes and pizza etc. There was a wide range of tasty traditional food. Endless amounts of drinks and snacks. The barman was so always happy to help and made the most amazing Moroccan tea! The hotel is across the…
 November 2016,5,Faultless sums it up,"From arrival to departure all the boxes were ticked. Spotless hotel in tip top condition, friendly helpful staff and wonderful food. All inclusive actually was, from bottles of water freely available, to fresh towels at the pool and free Wifi too. The rooms were cleaned, towels replaced daily, powerful shower and everything worked. There was a hair-dryer, fridge and TV in the room and ample sockets. Brought my own kettle as I enjoy a cup of tea when I wake up and before bed and have never yet had a kettle in the room in 8 years of going all inclusive. The food was amazing; different themes - with the restaurant decorated to match each evening- and lots of choice. Drinks were served in glasses in the restaurant and bar but not at the pool. There was constant maintenance…"
 November 2016,5,Wonderful Holiday,"Food was excellent, lots of choice and very tasty! Pool was clean (but cold) and always sun beds available! Room was clean and we had a blocked sink that was fixed within the hour of reporting it! The entertainment was very basic but we did hear thst there were shows put on in the theater but only heard of this on our last evening as they didn't seem to be advertised anywhere! Animation team put on entertainment throughout the day but there isn't lots of pressure to join in which I appreciated as have been hassled a lot at previous hotels by animation teams. Beach towels are provided. The beach itself is huge. Never actually went to our 'private' beach as we were quite underwhelmed by this as was not very private at all. We walked to the left passed the 5 star hotels to a shack…"
 October 2016,5,Romholiday,"Fantastic hotel, all the staff were friendly and helpful. The food was amazing, different everyday and very tasty. Everywhere was kept spotlessly clean and the barmen certainly new how to make cocktails 😁 all in all I would strongly recommend this hotel and will probably go back there sometime in the future when I've explored more of the world."
 November 2016,5,Faultless,"Just spent an amazing week at this fabulous hotel fantastically helpful friendly staff in an amazing location in a truly unforgettable country. You may read a few reviews from people moaning, that they didn't do enough burgers or the staff spoke French. Hello this is a French speaking country in North Africa if you want Blackpool in the sun then go elsewhere. If you want a truly magical warm friendly beautiful hotel then this is the past for you. Loved every minute thank you hotel Almohades."
 July 2016,5,"Warm friendly great family resort, made us feel welcome!","We stayed at the Hotel Les Almohades for a weeks Family Holiday on the Beautiful Agadir Beach. During our stay we were made to feel welcome to their hotel and were treated exceptionally by all the members of the team. On arrival our porter Ben saeed (the one with the hat) picked up our Cases and kept them to one side while we checked in. the process although long winded seemed to take place without issue, taxes paid and money exchanged (great rate may I say) we were shown to our room. We stayed in room number 2 on the ground floor - this room is perfect for a family - it is close to the restaurant + the pool and also no far from the lobby area and the reception. The room had all the amenities you could want a hairdryer wardrobe safe TV a mini fridge etc. The Staff did their…"
 July 2016,3,OK for that price but be prepared,"Service is poor. I will describe my experience in detail to give better understanding of it's quality. Staff hardly understand english. We are family of 5 people, so we had booked 2 numbers. Having checked in, we were given keys from rooms which were occupied by other people. There were no people in these rooms, but there were all their things. So there is no guarantee, that some stranger will not come to your number. After getting other numbers, we were asked to wait for 20 minutes, because one of the room hadn't been prepared yet. We went out for a walk and to have a diner, and when we came back after 1.5 hours it turned out that the cleaning hadn't even been started. I had to talk to everybody at the reception and even with hotel manager in order to find a maid and to make…"
 July 2016,2,"Awful Customer Service From Top Level Management, Shocking End To The Trip!","Up until the last day this was probably one of the best holidays I've been on. Let me start with the good points - all lower level staff (cleaners, waiters, animation team, porters) were lovely and worked incredibly hard to ensure you had a good time. The hotel was clean, food was nice and there was many amenities for both adults and children to enjoy. It is in a good situation to the beach and the main town / promenade was buzzing with life in the evenings. Now to the issues - the top level management were incredibly rude and unhelpful. Unfortunately we were victims of the Low Cost Holiday administration incident, and although we had already pre-paid the company for the holiday, the hotel had yet to be paid from the company. This resulted in the management keeping us hostage…"
 July 2016,2,1 week stay july 2016,"stayed here for a week all inclusive with my boyfriend. food was very average. lack of selection. one of the nights i actually got physically sick after the food. the staff were very rude, we did go during ramamdam which may have a input to being a tad out of character but there shouldnt be a excuse to be treated bad. one of the bar staff coughed in our drink after we had a word about him being rude. the service just wasnt what it should have been for the price we paid. the hotel rep took the paperwork for our transfer back to the airport off us saying we didnt need it so that we didnt know the details and would then have to book one of the hotels taxis. dont go its a waste of money. agadirs city in general didnt have much to offer. youd have a better time in marrachech"

 January 2015,4,Winter holiday,We stayed at this hotel for 17 days in January of this year fof the price we paid it is hard to fault this hotel We were disappointed with our first room as we had both sea and pool view but no sun during thr day within two days we were moved to the other side of the hotel Rooms roomy and cleaned well with fresh towels when wanted There was varied and it was possible to eat a different meal each day Staff were great
