The staff are extremely hospitable and always open for a chat. Ibrahim recounted a history of Morocco for us on the rooftop terrace which overlooks Fes old town.

He said this is enough time. And it probably is if the taxi would have appeared. It did not… get yourself a taxi from the nearby bus station. Though not every driver wants to ride you to the train station you will find one. The hostel is nice by the way.

There is also plenty of nooks and secluded spots around the building to sit and relax on a balcony or landing. I checked in late at night but staff weren’t that welcoming and didn’t provide any information. I was told breakfast was downstairs and taken to my 6 bed dormitory.

Since we’re from Europe it was a bit of a cultural shock when we first came to Fes airport quite late at the night but the taxi driver which we booked via Medina Social Club was very kind and welcoming - he drove us to the nearest parking possible to the hostel and showed us the way (3min walk from the taxi drop-off).

First night, we ate at their restaurant and asked them to make something different than the regular tagine fare (we were all vegetarians). We were delighted with what they made for us - the cooked salads, soups and chickpeas were very delicious and were very flavorful. Even the variation of Indian Samosa was excellent. We ate our breakfast here every morning which was filling (typical moroccan breakfast with assortment of food). They also were able to provide laundry services as decent prices.

He was available by when I called inquiring for vacancies, when I called for directions through the Byzantine maze of the old city, when I called after checking out to see whether they found shoes I might have left there (they had).

However none of the other places I stayed on my 12 days in Morocco have had bed bugs and I’m certain there will always be people coming from the desert. No excuses! Also the bugs were huge which means there is lots of them and they are fully grown. It’s taken 10 days for the bites to go away and caused extreme amounts of discomfort.

Clean towels and bed sheets were provided. The wifi is free, but sometimes it didn't function as I wished it would. Staff members are absolutely friendly and hospitable. One of them even used a map to show us the way out of the Medina, for you can get lost easily if you're not familiar with the surroundings there: streets are similar to each other to some extent, and there are many turns to take.

I definetely recommend this place and look forward to visit my friends there on my next trip. kind regards Finn",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,5,"Wonderful, perfect hostel in the heart of the Medina","The Medina Social Club felt like a little ""safe haven"" while I stayed there last week. All the staff there was absolutely wonderful, so kind and helpful! I had a bit of a problem with another hostel and when I returned Hamzeh and the other staff helped me and were SO KIND!!! i hadn't booked to stay and were fully booked but sorted a bed out for me so that I could stay which was truly wonderful. They have an open air area when you walk in that is big and has a lot of space, a really nice roof terrace, the rooms and beds are clean (and they provide you with a clean towel). The food is also great - both breakfast (included) and dinner. The wifi in the main areas is great and I met some really lovely people around my age when I was there. If you're getting a taxi from the…",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2018,5,"Beautiful Riad, nice owners!","We had to cancel our stay at the Medina social Club spontaneously because we had to continue our journey - if we had known earlier, we would have stayed there the first 2 nights though. It is directly inside the medina and really beautiful. Even after we cancelled our night, we could leave our bags there for the day, for free, which was great.

 January 2018,5,Beautiful riad hostel,Comfy beds with individual light and plugs. Decent sized lockers. Very hot showers. Views from the roof are fantastic. Food is very nice and a good breakfast. Staff are friendly. Good location and reasonably easy to find. Thoroughly recommend. Only slight downside was the WiFi was a little temperamental but worked most of the time. Quite a social place.,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2018,2,The worst so far,"After being one week traveling around Morocco this guest house has been the worst so far. When we got there we were impressed by the courtyard as it is very beautiful but the nightmare started when we got into the room, first thing room was too old and not very clean what is not a big issue until you see hair from unknown people all over the blanket and considering is winter and still cold here in Fez having an only blanket and no sheets to cover yourself up is definitely not enough. The shower was not flushing so we ended up with water all over the bathroom an putting towels on to dry it as much as we could. Summarising there’s no way I repeat the experience.",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,5,The place to stay in Fes,"The Medina Social Club is the perfect place to stay whilst exploring Fes. Clean, excellent location and a rooftop terrace that gives an unrivalled view over the sprawling medina, the staff are friendly and the ensuite bathrooms spotless.",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,4,beautiful hostel in the fes medina,"The Medina Social Club is a great place to stay in the Medina of Fes. It is BEAUTIFUL and our room was more of a suite than just a double room. We even had a private entrance to the roof terrace. Three minor things: It was freezing cold. They provided a heater, but the blanket was super thin and it was still quite cold at night. If you're not going in the winter, like us, this won't be a problem. The water in the shower was cold as well and when we asked about it were told that we just had to wait five minutes (it never got warmer). Also, when we tried to check out at 10am we had to wait for 20min for someone to show up, which let to us almost missing our train. The hostel is quite new and these things will probably be fixed soon. As I said, these things didn't spoil our trip…",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,4,Perfect place to get lost in Medina,"We booked one night here on our trip to Fes and ended up staying 4. Such a great location to enable yourself to get lost in the Medina and truly see what it’s all about! Abdul and Abdul Ali were both very friendly and by the end, it felt as they were friends. The breakfast is amazing, and the rooftop is sensational! One problem is that the WiFi barely works, however seeing as though I didn’t travel to Morocco to spend time on my phone it didn’t bother me too much. All in all, a great stay and I would stay again.",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2017,4,Great place to stay,Stayed in two different private rooms here. Both were very nice and clean. It was relatively easy to find (for Fes medina). It's a pretty central location. The staff was very nice and decent breakfast included.,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2017,4,Good for younger people.,"Excellent location, easy to find with plenty of hotel direction signs. The room is clean and comfortable, breakfast is okay. Dinner tastes good but a bit pricy. We booked a room months in advance for 4 people just to make sure we got the room with all beds on the floor not the bunk one. We noticed that the hotel had put this room back on the market for the same period,so we did contact hotel to address our concern.We got the answer that they have 2 rooms identicle. However,by the time we got there,they put us to the room on the 3rd floor with all bunkbeds.It was not very comfortable for us as most of us are over50. An honesty would be appreciated, beside this matter,there is no other complaints.",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2017,5,Great!,"Food at the restaurant was excellent. All the staff were super kind, taking lots of their time to check us in, advise us on getting around Fez, and ensuring we had everything we could want or need. They served us meals up on the beautiful, clean and spacious patio like a 5 star restaurant. I had made a booking error and they accomidated me anyway with great kindness. The location was also great! If I go back to Fes I'll be staying here!",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2017,5,Very nice food,We went for dinner to the hostel and the food was fantastic but priced accordingly also. We really enjoyed the stunning view and the care for detail.

 August 2017,5,When owners become family 😍,"My friend and I stayed here for our time in fez during Eid festival. We were greeted by our lovely transfer driver who had waited 2 hours at the airport for our delayed flight. He welcomed us so nicely and chatted away all the way . We were charged only 15 euros by our riad for our transfer which to begin with set the standard of what beautiful people they are. We arrived to our ( hostel) far far more than any hostel I have ever stayed in. This place stole my heart. It was so clean it was polished , it was so well looked after. We quickly became very close to the owners and talked to them for hours on end, every member of staff could not do enough for us, and it was out of love and kindness not forced through it being a job. The terrace was beautiful , the food was out…",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2017,5,We will be back,"Very beatiful riad in which you can totally relax. Nice rooftop terrace on which you can enjoy a bottle of wine (200 dh for riad guests), where ocasionally there's live music. It's very easy to find. The staff is the best, especially Hamza, who will take care of you during you stay. He even woke up before 6am just to prepare us a basic breakfast when we needed to leave at 6. He's a Real professional who will even advice you for the rest of you trip.

 August 2017,5,Awesome place to sleep eat and enjoy In Fés,"We stayed in this Hostel for 2 nights and we were astonished for the beauty of the place. A very recent and well decorated hostel, very friendly and quiet. The entrance and the patio are soooo beautifull. It has a little fountain in the middle and tables and chairs to rest on arrival, and to have a very tasty breakfast in the morning to have strength to face the day walking in the medina. The location is very nice, inside the old medina and not difficult to find. The rooms (I was able to see more than one cause we were many) were very clean and soon fresh (with air conditioning, you will understand how good it was went you experienced it). The sheets and the bathroom were clean also and they provide tree towels to bath, to dry hands and another don't know what for 😂).…",Hostel_Medina_Social_Club-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Hostel_Medina_Social_Club,Fes_Fes_Meknes
