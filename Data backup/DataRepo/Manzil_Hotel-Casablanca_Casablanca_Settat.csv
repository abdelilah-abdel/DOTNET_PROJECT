 October 2019,4,"Good value, don't be scared about the localization","I got this hotel in exchange for some miles I had. The hotel is in the industrial area of Casablanca, so our first impression was very bad (of the area). The staff is great, the hotel is very good. AC and TV. No fridge though. Breakfast is good enough for the price and after visiting downtown Casablanca at night, we decided this area is much friendlier because there are a lot of shops open till late, neighbors on the streets and we found the most excellent restaurant hidden on the street behind it, called ""La Bonne Adresse"" (11 Rue de la Participacion - Tel 0522 241 759 - Mr. Naimi Hajjaj). It doesn't appear on Google but do go there. The owner is 78 years old and he makes amazing food.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2018,2,more expensive and worse than expected,"Room: cockroach in the bathroom Breakfast: dirty dishes, burnt food, dirty seating area - we lost our appetites Hotel: they charge too much for the room itself, but adding the taxes, it´s definitely way too expensive for what you´ll be getting. somebody is trying to make it nice, by hanging some paintings on the walls, but i prefer clean than dirty and artsy Staff: unfriendly Location: outside of the center, 15-ish minutes to the mosque by car",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2018,3,Basic hotel for short stay,"We stayed for a couple of days on our way elsewhere, and it was decent. It is definitely a very basic hotel - breakfast is not included, and they don't even have shampoo in the bathroom, but it is decently clean and the staff is kind and helpful. Great for a short stay, but if you are staying for a while and want to enjoy I would recommend spending a bit more for something more luxurious!",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The internet connection is not very good. Rooms are good and have TV. The cleanliness of the rooms is not bad. Bathroom also is ok. I had a a flight. So I stayed one night.

 December 2016,1,Do not go there,"Dodgy neighbor hood, unsecure hotel, expensive, dirty, breakfast does not taste good, the hotel is far away from the towncentre it is really a waste of time.

 January 2016,2,Employees were awful,"The desk employees were awful. On check-out I was over charged and they refused to give us the finished price. The employee was a teenager, who hardly even knew how to use the credit card machine. The other employee (who was a bit fatter and black) we had problems with, came to our arguing taxi driver, who was asking for triple the amount that was shown on the meter, and demanded we paid the taxi driver what he wanted. (Ended up calling police and paid the amount on meter screen) The hotel is very far from anything and you will need to take taxis to get back and forth. It would have been better just to pay a bit extra for one closer to the center and with nicer rooms and staff.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,3,Decent enough,"Decent enough for a stop over in cosmopolitan and lively Casa. Good shower, clean comfy beds, feels secure.

 October 2016,3,Decent Location,"The rooms are clean, though a bit dark. It is close (about 2km) away from the Train Station (walkable in the daytime), but fairly dark streets at night. The front staff gave us a good recommendation for a nearby local restaurant (best pastelle's!) but were not entirely helpful when we were needing a taxi to get across town the next day. The breakfast was okay. Had some cut up veggies, porridge (like cream of wheat), breads, cereals, boiled or rubbery scrambled eggs, coffee/tea, and jams. A bit overpriced for what they offered. I'd had rather gone to the supermarket a few blocks away and got myself some yogurt and muesli (but we were in a rush).",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2016,4,A good 5 night stay,"I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel considering the price per night.

 March 2016,2,You get nothing but just a room,"I always say I would give low rating to a hotel only if the staff is rude, but this property managed my booking really bad. After one night spent there I received a no show e-mail from Booking.com. I went to the reception and they said it was a mistake. Then, the second day, the card of the room was not working and the room hadn't been cleaned. Besides, the staff had changed, so the new guy there had no idea how many nights would I stay. The breakfast is very poor, with old cut vegetables - you could clearly see that they were cut hours before they were served. The bathroom has no shelves, no spaces where you can put your things, so it all ends up on the floor or on the small, small space near the sink. The sheets were grey, but I want to believe they were cleaned. So…",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2015,4,A good hotel in Casablanca,"We stayed here on our last day in Morocco and it was enough good for us. It is far from the city center, but you can catch a taxi for a little amount of money. It is a well-equipped hotel and the bathroom was great! (which is not too common in Morocco) The location is not too friendly, you should arrive here by taxi, not on foot, just to be sure. For it's price this is a great choice in Casablanca, I can recommend it!",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,3,Ok price but far away.,"Its ok but its quite a long walk to the city centre. Dodgy place to stay, but if you want to be in a cheap hotel outside the city centre then its ok.

Very tight down there, only big enough for bicycles and motos. That done I moved into my room (501), which was spacious, clean, had a comfortable bed and also a balcony. The bathroom and shower was very good, although the drains smelt - quite common in Morocco. I walked to the nearby pizza restaurant / take away for dinner because it was close. My pizza was only average. Other dining options are available within walking distance too and I'd try that next time. The staff spoke English well enough and were courteous and helpful to me. Breakfast was mediocre but quite OK for 4€. Overall I'd rate Manzil…",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,2,Out of the way hotel,This hotel is located in a very poor industrial area of Casablanca. The hotel looks lovely from the street but definitely out of place as everything around it is dirty and run down. The room was well presented and clean. I Would not venture out at night in this area. We were given a ground floor room which was extremely noisy. Aircon blew hot air all night so we sweltered. The bathroom had lots of mould around the shower and under the rim of the hand basin. Wifi was very good though. We paid for breakfast which was from 7am. We arrived at 8.30 am to find there was no food only bread available. They did eventually make us some scrambled eggs. Because of the location - 30 minutes from the airport would only use it for a stopover or if you were in transit.

 July 2015,4,A quiet place to sleep,"The hotel is clean and the rooms are good, AC was not functioning in the first room, but the staff solved the problem.

 July 2015,2,Did not feel safe!,"The hotel is located in a somewhat industrial area, surrounded by car mechanics and the like. 10 minutes in a taxi from the CTM bus station. There was one restaurant about five minutes walk, again located on top of a car wash/service centre. The hotel claims 24hr food service, however neglect to provide a phone number to call reception for this. Twice during the night we were woken by someone attempting to get into the room, the door has keyless card access but thankfully a dead bolt on the inside as well, which prevented them getting in. We heard two male voices outside the room and they hung around for a while.

 July 2015,3,Big rooms and air con,"Big room, air con worked fine but that's it. I would not want to stay here longer than the one night, hands down worst breakfast we've ever been presented. We only stayed here because it was cheaper than the Ibis whilst waiting for a train to Fes, retrospectively I'd pay the extra $ for the ibis if I'd known.

TV worked but the window was a bit small for my liking. The hotel has a nice Moroccan room to relax and an outside small place. The breakfast was fresh, the pastries were still warm. If you arrive after half way during the breakfast period chances are they would be not much food left. The coffee machine only gives you espresso or hot water which is same for cappuccino lovers. WIFI was the highlight because finding good fast internet is rare.

 April 2015,3,Not quite as satisfied as I expected to be after reading other reviews,"I stayed at the Manzil Hotel for one night in early April 2015. I reserved the room after reading several positive reviews of the hotel on tripadvisor.com and other sites. My experience was not terrible, but it was also not as positive as some other reviewers’. Unlike other hotels at which I stayed in Morocco, the Manzil Hotel charged the full room rate to my credit card at the time I made the reservation (over a month before my arrival). I was not informed in advance that my card would be charged when I made the reservation. I sent an email to the hotel a few days before arriving to reconfirm the reservation and ask if I could check in a few hours early. A hotel staff responded that I could check in early, but when I arrived at the agreed time, the room was not ready.

 April 2015,3,Basic and clean,"This is a 2 star hotel so it does live to that standard. The rooms are basic, the area where it is located is not great. It was quiet at night which is very important for me as I am light sleeper and anything wakes me up. The beds are clean as well as the bathrooms BUT the towels were clean BUT they are probably very old and I don't know if it was the lighting in there but they were not white. Agree with other reviewers that the room is cold but our heater did work.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Decoration was very basic. Lift inside the hotel. You are issued with the tv remote when you check in. It is a very basic room and does not look as nice as the pictures. We didn't have the breakfast so can't comment on that. Far from everywhere. When we caught a taxi to hasan mosque it was 16 Dirhams from the main road towards the water. It is about a 5 minute walk to the nearest tram station and a one way tram ticket is 7 Dirhams. When we left we hailed a taxi on the street to take us to the train station he used the meter.

 March 2015,3,Good value in Casablanca,"It took a while to find anywhere in our price range with good reviews. We arrived around sunset so hard to orientate ourselves, especially as the hotel had run out of maps. Reception that evening wasn't very friendly but told us we needed to take a petit taxi to the centre. Taxis range from 11-30 dirham. Most use the meter where you will get a cheaper price. The room was ok and quiet. During the early morning the bathroom smelled very bad but this disappeared by 9am. Reception in the morning was a friendly, smiling young lady. So this hotel has some faults but is ok for its price. I would rather be more central though.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2015,3,Nice place,"I stayed here for two nights after flying into Casablanca. The rooms was nice, with hot water.

 February 2015,3,OK hotel for a quick stay,"We were only in Casablanca for a couple of days as it was our entry point into Morocco. This hotel seemed to be the only one we could find with OK reviews that was at all affordable. The room was fine but without much character. It's location was in a pretty isolated part of the city near the port so the dimly lit streets with groups of young men hanging around each corner was a bit confronting and did not feel entirely safe. Although the floors were quite dirty, the sheets and towels were clean. For those travellers just travelling quickly through Casa, this hotel is fine.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2015,2,Just passable,"This hotel is a bit rough around the edges. But I suppose the low price makes it barely passable. I spent a couple of nights there with no major disasters. But it didn't seem particularly clean and the breakfast was not all that good. Nor was it particularly friendly. The location is also not the best. I couldn't see any decent restaurants nearby. But if you are looking for an authentic inner city Casablanca neighborhood, then it fits the bill for that. It seemed safe enough. The French-speaking staff can give you directions to the nearest tram / light rail stop which is a short hike away and from there you can reach downtown Casablanca. Incidentally, Casa is ideal if you're into art deco much of which remains, if in a faded state, from the 1920s and 1930s.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2014,4,"Excellent budget option, a bit out of the way","We spent four nights in Casablanca and moved from our first hotel to the Manzil after two not so good nights. The Manzil had all the things our first hotel did not: quiet, a good bed, good hot shower, nice TV with movie channels, and good wifi in the room. The room itself was huge with a sitting area and couch which was very nice. The only down side at all is that it's not really walking distance to anything you'd want to see. It was about a ten minute walk to the nearest tram stop and maybe 15-20 minutes to Casa Voyageurs train station. There's also not many restaurants around, as it's a residential and not toursity area, but there is a good bakery about a block away that we stopped at for breakfast goodies.

 November 2014,4,Nice stay in a residential\port area.,"We were forced to stay in Casablanca because of a super long layover. We chose this hotel because of the reviews and the tight budget. Fortunetely we were not disappointed. It is a nice hotel in a residential lower middle class neighbourhood not too far from downtown. The hotel itself is a bit difficult to find, but all the taxis we used were able to find it without much problem. We are not sure that someone not used to the area, or not using a GPS could find it easily. The closest Tram station is a good 15 minutes walking distance. We were able to do it though with our three kids. There are many roads to cross, the sidewalks are in bad shape and there is an amazing amount of cats on the streets.

But, if you call the taxi from the reception it is about 50 Dh plus (taxi on call is charged extra). The breakfast was ok if you like sweat as well as in most hotels of this category in Morocco.

The first room we enjoyed far more than the second. The first room (505) was excellent and really enjoyed it. Was large, comfortable and quiet. The second room (18) on the first floor was much smaller and you noticed the lack of light much more as its only window faced onto the terrace so had to keep the curtain shut for privacy and was quite noisy at night (people watching the world cup I think) though the shower was larger and looked nicer, but otherwise was a bit rougher around the edges. I liked the decoration of both rooms though very clean and crisp and both rooms were very clean. The one thing that may put you off is the location though tis did not bother us.

Staff were efficient, multilingual, and welcoming. Minuses: a cockroach in the bathroom, breakfast (served downstairs in a rather ""institutional"" feeling room; baguette with butter/jam, olives, cucumbers, etc) was only average, flakes of something (paint or plaster?) on bath/room floors.

I would say that if you spend your days in Casablanca never miss to stay in Manzil hotel.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2014,4,Manzil Hotal Casablanca,"Good value for money, its a little off the city centre. Therefore, taxi go in and out is a must. We got a rental car with driver, so its not a problem with us. Rooms are clean, rate I book doesn't included breakfast. If need breakfast add US$5. Good wifi connection in room. Toilet is a bit small, specially the shower, but its bearable if you are a shinny person, if you are fat, you may accidentally hit the water tab while you are moving around the shower, and the water will turn either too hot or cold. The water is hot enough so if its winter, nice to have hot shower. There are coffee shops near by the hotel, and a restaurant which is about 5 min. walk, serves pizza and a la carte, The owner is a nice man, speaker both good English and French. Food is good and price are good.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2013,5,"Manzil Hotel, Casablanca, Morocco","A taxi ride from Casablanca railway station to Manzil Hotel should cost 15 dirhams or less. This is a very clean, comfortable hotel, with spotless en-suite bathrooms. There was always hot water. We stayed here two nights & we felt this was an efficiently-run hotel. Staff were pleasant, friendly & courteous. There is a buffet breakfast at extra cost (less than £3/person). Getting to the Medina or Hasan II Mosque necessitates taxis (which are not expensive as long as their meters are used). We strongly recommend staying at this hotel when in Casablanca.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2013,4,good hotel ..remote location,"Similar to Ibis series, although it is not of them … good…clean …good breakfast…few but enough channels…no mini cooler…free Wi-Fi…but compared to Ibis casa voyageurs (for example) it's smaller in size, cheaper in price, and (this is important) it's far about 12 min. (by walking) to Bu Hmad tram station, and 21 min to Casa voyageurs.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2013,5,"Very Helpful, Friendly, Clean, Comfortable Hotel","The staff at Hotel Manzil. Soufian, Laila and Hecham was very very kind and helpful as they went out of their way to assist and help. Right away they helped me to get a converter so that i could use my computer. Also Internet access was easy to setup and worked very well. They made some very helpful recommendatins of where to visit in town. I stayed there five days and it was a very cozy place. The rooms are very comfortable and very clean. The breakfast was very good with plenty of good choices to start the day. I want to thank all the people at Hotel Manzil that were so kind with me.

 May 2013,3,"Basic hotel, friendly staff, but...","The neighborhood does not look safe at first glance, but we where 2 couples and felt comfortable with walking from tram station back to the hotel late at night. It takes 10 minutes to get to the tram station, a very modern tram by the way. We stayed two nights and found the hotel basic, but clean. Rooms and breakfast are ok, staff is friendly. Moreover, it is 5 minutes by taxi to train station Gare Voyageurs. Would recommend for short stays.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2013,5,Best Hotel in Casablanca,"I'm a business traveller and i've tryed some hotels in the whole Morocco. I can say that This is my favorite. Spacious, clean, friendly staff, clean bedrooms, good bed, free good wi-fi internet, flat screen with international chanels, placed in a quite zone with calm atmosfere. Perfect for people who are in business trips. A bit away from the city center so you can rest anytime of the day. Have already recomended it and people loved it because of the price/quality it offers. Really good place ti Stay.

 August 2012,3,"Manzil Hotel: Sometimes i feel like saying ""Lord i just don't care""","I will start my evaluation saying i'm not part of the staff and i'll try to be very fair in my appreciation, to be usefull in your decision. I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend for one night only: our purpose was to get a little rest from our bus trip from Essaouira to Casablanca (lasted for 6 hours), and the next day we moved to Meknès by train. This is NOT a central hotel, so it's really convenient to understand that you can get quickly by TAXI to any convenient point (Casablanca Voyageurs - the main train station) or to the Habous medina (the new medina) in 10 minutes. I would advice you to take the address of the hotel with you, or if possible a printed map of the location. A lot of taxi drivers we talked to didn't know this hotel existed. During the day i'm sure…",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2012,1,Recommendable to your enemy!,"Not only placed in an awful location, but a horrible neighbourhood, smelly, and not reliable. My best moment in the hotel was when they said my reservation was taken by someone else, and for that reason they placed us in another hotel! Really don't go there!",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2012,3,Good business hotel,Small business hotel with quiet location. We have stayed our last night here after two weeks tour in Morocco. Room is large and clean. Friendly staffs and free wifi provided. Breakfast is just good enough. First time to check in a hotel who will give you a TV remote control set together with the room key. Have found two coffee shops nearby and have enjoyed a cup of coffee with the local people.,Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2012,1,HORRIBLE Manzil hotel,We are a couple. We was in the Manzil Hotel 2 nights and was HORRIBLE. It´s very far from city center and you have to take a taxi (and you spend 5 euros in the taxi) if you want to get there. There isn´t any restaurant or bar close to this hotel so if you want to have lunch or dinner you have to take another taxi (and another 5 euros). The breakfast in the hotel is HORRIBLE also. They boil some eggs and put some tea or chocolate or coffee or juice or sweets just ONE time in a WEEK. IT ISN´T HEALTHY and they CHEAT us because they said us that the breakfast was 4 euros and when we left the hotel they increase the price 20% and they didn´t explain why. The room has air conditioner but VERY NOISY and It´s impossible to sleep. The cleaning staff was ok (but they didn´t clean the room…,Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2012,4,Perfect choice to stay over one night en rout,"Very friendly, helpful and competent staff. Really nice people. Concerning the hotel, it's designed for people just looking to stay over for a night and is almost ideal for this purpose. The only shortcoming is the location. Presumably it is 800 m from Casa Voyageur railway station, so very convenient for those who arrive by train and depart to the airport (direct train). In fact the boulevard is blocked by construction works and detour takes much more time. Very close to the ocean, but difficult to find a taxi to get to the historical center. Also not all taxi drivers know the address and no object of common knowledge are close to it. Anyhow all this doesn't spoil your staying here if your goal is just to find inexpensive and decent shelter for a night.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2012,1,Would recommend this hotel to someone I really hate.,"Stayed there for one night and booked this hotel because it was „near“ Casa Voyageurs from which we had to catch the train to the airport the next morning. Hotel is in a fishy neighbour hood, nothing there to see or do, no bars, no restaurants, no nothing, except some really strange characters. There was no customer service from the staff, our room smelt and we were not alone since we had company of cockroaches size of a small rat. SAT TV for german, french and arab speaking people, no english except BBC, but this hotel was all the bad news I could bear for the day. Seeing the location of the hotel I asked the receptionist to order us a taxi at 6 am since we had to be early at the airport, was told they dont work tomorow (they as in taxi drivers) but i could go a few streets…",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2012,4,"Very good, but certainly not central","Nice, clean hotel with good service. It is located abit outside the city center, but minitaxis are around. This is also close to the train station. We stayed there the day we arrived to Morocco, to rest before going to Fes. Free WiFi and A/C.

 June 2012,5,Best Hotel in Morocco,"I have been in Morocco for 3 weeks. Kenitra, Rabat and Casablanca, and this hotel is by far the best hotel I have stayed in.

 April 2012,5,Great Hotel to book for Casablanca...read why!!!,"Hotel is awesome, new, clean, staff are unreal helpful. Got us a hairdryer, restaurant tips, taxis, will download you train schedules, tips on onward travel within Morocco, download and print maps of Casablanca and onward locations...its incredible. And free wifi in your room!!! yes, its not the best location, BUT taxis are right out front and will that charge by the meter (2 u.s. 20Dh gets you to Hassan II Mosque 20dh) can easily walk back towards the hotel to see the rest of the attractions. Its also a good location for easy commute to train station (15Dh). Trust me, do not let location deter you from picking this hotel. BEST, please read...I could not find a hotel the following day in Fes (due to a conference) and the manager called a contact for me and had me booked…",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2012,2,Value for Money but Won't Recomment it.,"In a nutshell, this was cheap and we used it to literally sleep before flying home from Casablanca airport. However, the room did not look like the one in the pictures. There was 'interesting' exposed wire fittings on some of the lights, the room smelt and the shower had a little cockroach in. Breakfast and taxes are not included in the price which was annoying but they only added about £3.45 in total to the bill and the breakfast was actually very good. Take it or leave it really. Let me know if you have any other questions.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2012,4,Clean and spacious,"The hotel room was very clean and spacious. The bed was big enough to sleep with a infant. The hotel provides free internet and the staff was nice. the hotel location was not good, only found with the help of GPS. Good value for the money.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2012,3,Value for money,"This little hotel has been open for just about one year. It is by no means central, and quite difficult to find. However, from the point of view of value for money, it is a little gem. Our room was large, and the bed was big and very comfortable, with a small balcony overlooking the street, which was good for us, as parking for the hotel is on the street. The area is not pretty or touristy in any way, but it did not feel unsafe. The staff were charming and helpful. There is a self-service buffet breakfast, which was a bit average but perfectly adequate. The hotel provides free WiFi. Everything was exceptionally clean. I would certainly stay here again.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2012,3,"Good hotel, on a bad location.","Location: Not central and hard to find. Near the police station, they helped us to get taxi's because if the driver sees you are a tourist they charge a lot more! Tip: ask the rate to persons on the street before you take a taxi, so you have an idea of the price. We looked for the hotel a long time, we were in the right neighborhood but nobody seemed to know it. We got lost and took a taxi after all. Rooms: Nice, big clean room with great beds. Service: Ok, but a map of the city would be welcome. They only had one hanging on the wall.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2011,3,Bad location,"This hotel is in a rather dodgy area. It is however clean and neat. Our room was spacious with a very comfortable double bed, a decent sized cupboard for our clothing and a little desk for making notes. My husband and I struggled with public transport. Taxis are not reliable at all. We took a taxi to Morocco Mall and when we wanted to return to our hotel, it took almost a hour to get a taxi. The breakfast was good and the staff was very helpful.",Manzil_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat,Manzil_Hotel,Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
