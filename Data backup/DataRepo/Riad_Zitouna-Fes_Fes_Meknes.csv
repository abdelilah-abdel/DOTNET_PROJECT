 February 2020,4,Beautiful Riad in a great location,"This is a nice Riad very centrally located. The rooms are a great size and service is amazing. We had a smaller room and they upgraded us for no charge. There‚Äôs a pool in the courtyard, which I‚Äôm sure is nice for when it is warm. Since I was there in February, it was cool and the pool is not heated. There‚Äôs a little hot tub, which didn‚Äôt have water in it when I was there. The rooms are clean but a little cold during the winter. They are very accommodating and give you more blankets if need be. The beds and pillows are VERY comfortable. Had one of the best night sleeps in all of Morocco. Only problem is the WiFi in the rooms on the second floor is not very strong. Additionally, since it is easy to get lost in the Medina, the hotel staff will bring you where you need to go (a‚Ä¶",Riad_Zitouna-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Zitouna,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,4,In the middle of the m√©dina,"Stunning patio and great welcoming staff. This is an authentic riad literally in the middle of the m√©dina. The room was spacious and clean, apart from a small accident: some stains on the bed sheets that were kindly changed upon request. The rooftop offers a great view on the m√©dina. The staff will arrange for great private trips around the area and also guides for the labyrinth of the m√©dina, which is a bit of a mess but part of the Fes experience, don‚Äôt be scared but pay attention and don‚Äôt trust anyone. Breakfast is super good and rich, with local specialties.",Riad_Zitouna-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Zitouna,Fes_Fes_Meknes

You enter the gates from the bustling street into a magical world of understated elegance, a gorgeous tiled interior with a peaceful courtyard and pool. Our room was spacious and immaculate, our breakfast plentiful and delightful. But best of all were the hosts, who were incredibly warm and helpful. Samadi made us feel totally at home, and arranged guides, restaurant reservations, etc. One night we even got to go into the kitchen and learn to cook an amazing Moroccan meal. I wish we could have stayed longer! Thank you Samadi and all the Riad Zitouna staff!",Riad_Zitouna-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Zitouna,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 December 2018,5,not a good way to start holidays,"The host named Abdel Samamad I am not sure if is spelled well the name, but he made our stay better, he was really helpful, really good, anything you need just as k him, he'll make it happen. The rooms are really big like the pics, and restrooms are great. ¬∑ What I really didn't enjoy was the day we arrived, after a long trip, and walking too much with lots of luggage and kids and baby, we were 11, we were told by the manager that we couldn't stay here, with no explanation and it was late and dark outside, you book a room and someone who is not even present tells you over the phone that you cannot stay here. After clearing things up they finally accepted us and we were given the authorization to stay, they need to sort this one out, especially when I paid almost 500 euros for‚Ä¶",Riad_Zitouna-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Zitouna,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,4,Great value riad in Fez,"This riad had a lovely pool. The breakfast was delicious. We are an older couple and we had our daughter and boyfriend with us, We had a room with two beds separated by a lounge. Our bedrooom had access to the bathroom but they had to go out the door and down some steps to access a bathroom they could use otherwise they would have been coming through our room. So a little bit of a strange configuration. They had a rooftop area which was lovely.",Riad_Zitouna-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Zitouna,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,A wonderful home in the Medina,"This riad is so beautiful and its location in the Medina was perfect for me. I found the Medina fascinating and challenging and the riad's location allowed for much exploration. One of the staff helped orient me in the Medina by showing me how to navigate my way to the Bab Boujeloud (The Blue Gate) -- so helpful! The staff, primarily two people, were ever so warm and friendly and took very good care of me! They served wonderful breakfasts, answered questions, shared something of their lives with me -- very special since I very much wanted to meet and get to know at least a few Moroccans and had found that traveling and being a tourist did not easily make this opportunity available. I will be forever grateful! And I hope to return next year with friends and relatives to share‚Ä¶",Riad_Zitouna-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Zitouna,Fes_Fes_Meknes

My two top favourite places are the terrace and the ""hammam"".I really enjoyed my stay there;it boosted my spirit and eased away my stress and tension. So peaceful and glamorous!
