The place was moderately clean but only 1 shower was not great. One things to note** it’s noisy. It seems one of the owners family lives there so there were countless times their kids would be screaming or crying. Also they have a bird cage with birds that chirp all the time. Finally, the beds are so uncomfortable. They definitely went the cheapest route and you can feel it.

It has a nice roof deck area that was a comfortable place to eat breakfast and to hang out. We booked a private room that was good sized and generally comfortable. The price was very reasonable, and the support staff was very friendly. There were however several issues that arose during our stay that prevent me from leaving a positive review. The first issue was at check in. Only after we arrived were we informed that the riad was cash only. Not ideal communication, but fine. We paid for two nights and said that we would go to an atm while out for dinner. When we returned to the riad there was no one in the office so we went to bed. Rather late in the evening there was a knock on the door demanding payment.…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,2,Time to move this Riad down from #26,My honest opinion is the previous reviews are over rated. This Riad is unkempt and tired. The bathrooms are filthy. The highest price room smells like a sewer and the cheap perfume put in the room makes it even worse. The staff is very nice except the manager who thinks way too highly of himself and as a woman left me feeling unsettled. He is often seen laying around on the furniture in the entry room very unprofessional. When he did speak to me he came across very insincere. I have traveled the world. Low cost does not need to be low quality. The management here needs to improve the quality of this Riad to clean Morocco standards and conditions.,Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,5,"Fantastic stay at Riad Verus, would definitely recommend it and hope to be back soon myself!",Definitely recommend staying at Riad Verus! Everyone working there is super kind and they go out of there way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The Riad is very clean and comes with free breakfast too. The lobby is definitely the most beautiful one I’ve seen during my time in Morocco and the rooftop has plenty of room to enjoy a break from the busy streets of Fes. Here you are not just a guest but part of the family.,Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,5,Great spot! Good vibes,My friend and I had a great stay at Riad Verus. We had a super late check in (past midnight) and there was a freak thunderstorm going on. the owner made sure that we were picked up at the airport and transported to the hostel. He was very friendly when we checked in. The room was great! We booked a room for two that had a bunk bed. Also had an en suite toilet and shower. Everything was clean and working great. The riad is also very beautiful and had great vibes. Always had toilet paper and they even provide towels which was a plus. The laundry service was great and very prompt. The breakfast was glorious. They cook it to order and bring it to you. Hospitality of the staff was top notch. Definitely recommend this hostel.,Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,3,Great ambiance and views,"Stayed here briefly with 2 of my friends. Lovely views and overall vibe of the riad. Staff was also lovely and accommodating despite us not being in the best mood after traveling all day. One thing to note are that the dorms are co-ed and don’t offer much privacy. No curtains which is unusual. Bathrooms are not the cleanest, sometimes I felt dirtier leaving than entering. It’s a very fair price though and besides a couple things, everything else was great.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

They helped me as a solo traveler book an incredible trip to merzouga desert, and a well informative guide that led me through the Medina. Mohammed was 5-star tour guide. Friendly, took me away from touristic crowded places, to the unique streets that Moroccans walk everyday through. Mohammed talked from the heart about culture- he was waved in hello’s with many we encountered. If you want an amazing guide ask for Mohammed.

 July 2022,3,Great facilities but not really recommended,"had a very short stay in Fes and so my review is based on just two nights of being there. First off, this riad is SOOO beautiful! The terrace views are unmatched too, watching the sunset from the terrace was the highlight of my stay in Fes. I arrived mid afternoon during Eid. Dan checked me in and offered me tea on arrival. During check in, he mentioned to me that an issue had recently arisen with my room where it could not be locked from the inside and only the outside…what? The riad was pretty empty because of Eid and I was tired so I didn’t bother to look for another place to stay. I will say, I saw cameras everywhere in the riad so I felt somewhat safe, but as a solo female traveler this is not okay. Dan promised to fix this the next day, but it was not fixed. I also did…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 June 2022,3,Good - but room needs some improvements,"I stayed here as a solo traveller in the private room in June 2022 for 3 night Positives - private room was very nicely decorated and comfortable bed - Location of hostel is great - The lady who checks you in is lovely (I think her name is Aetofye) and makes you tea on arrival Negatives - The staff are sometimes hard to find/ it’s a bit disorganised. - The main issue is the lock on my Private room was broken, meaning If you locked the door from the inside you become locked in the room! I had to call the hostel to tell them I was locked in my room , the owner had to come and open the door for me to let me out - This is not ideal because it means you can’t lock the door when you are inside the room. The whole point of booking a private room is so you are able to have extra…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 June 2022,5,Best Hostel in Morocco 🇲🇦,This hostel is so beautiful! Very easy to get to from the bus station with a metered taxi for one euro. Location is right in the old medina. It is a huge mansion style house with two rooftop terraces. The breakfast was huge and the best I have had in Morocco! Very clean rooms and bathrooms. Free towels!

 June 2022,4,Nice place to stay,"It’s a nice place to stay. The beds are comfortable, there is an outlet to charge your phone next to the beds and it’s pretty clean. The guy that works at the hostel sold me a tour and later I found out I overpaid for it. In Morocco a lot of people will try to make you pay too much and this is also the case in this Riad. If you don’t have a lot of money ask around to other people in the hostel what they paid and look up online what normal prices are. What you can improve (why I didn’t give 5 stars): - I stayed in room 1 (a room with 7 beds). The bathroom in our room didn’t have a lock on it. So if you’re taking a shower someone can walk in on you. Just add a lock so people can shower without having the chance someone will see them naked. - You can add curtains to the bunk…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

Ate so well and so nice to not be the usual hostel fare I was having to stomach at other places; but here it was real Orange juice, really good coffee, avocado mash, tomatoes, cake, eggs, fruit salad and yoghurt, they outdid my expectations. The friendly workers were always on hand to help organize taxis or sign me up with a tour or bring me a nagila water pipe.

I felt safe as a solo traveler in the area. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The central meeting place is a comfortable hang out area and so cool to look at especially at night.

 March 2022,1,NOT GOOD 👎🏼 experience,"By far the worst hostel experience I’ve had in Morocco. I honestly can’t express enough the dissatisfaction with my stay. The cleanliness of the the bathroom, the owner charging 10€ for 1/2 kilo laundry, being served cold breakfast, booked a 10 bed dorm but an extra bed was add so it was 11 bed, the staff yelling for one another constantly, never any toilet paper in the bathroom, the owner tried over charging me for a taxi. I definitely got the feeling from the owner that he was only there to make money with doing as very little effort as possible. Being charged 10€ to wash clothes was outrageous! Other hostel in Morocco only charge at most 4€ for laundry or less. Even the other hostel in Fes don’t even charge that much. When I booked my stay it said that the tea was free.…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

This one is definitely the latter, but the interior is also very clean, the breakfast is delicious, it’s beautiful, and the location is good.

I've stayed in hostels in over 30 countries and this hostel is one of my favorite. The free breakfast is the best free breakfast I've ever seen at a hostel. The first night we were surprised to hear that there was a free vegetarian family dinner where all the travelers got to know each other. The second night we had free wine and the guests and staff stayed up late hanging out on the terrace. The third night they offered henna and a trip to a hammam and then a group of us went to a bar. The staff have been the most personable staff of any hostel I've stayed at. They are always hanging out in the common spaces and chatting with the guests. I can honestly say that staying here feels…,Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

Youssef helped us book bus tickets, led us several times through the medina to find what we were looking for, and even gave us an impromptu cooking class, where we made the best kefta tagine. The common area was absolutely gorgeous, hostel was clean, and beds were very comfy. Our stay was also very cheap and location was perfect for exploring the medina.

I met many great people in this hostel, it is truly a good networking point for your travel in Fez and onwards. Furthermore, the atrium is even more majestic than on the pictures.

 December 2019,1,Awful,"I witnessed the staff forcing people to write positive reviews online!! My experience - I was in the 5 bed room on the roof which was very cold, with bed bugs. The staff are like security and watch your every move and listen into your conversations. As a 35 year old woman I felt I was treated like a child ""where are you going?"" When walking in the hostel and told I wasn't allowed to walk up certain stairs. I was even on the toilet one time and a staff member knocked on the door and asked why I was in there for so long. It was quite unsettling! The guys who run it are creepy and if you are unlucky they will start texting you and ask to meet up. They are a danger to young women.

Location is also excellent - I will be back :)",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 January 2020,5,"Cozy, Friendly and Terribly Accommodating would be a sweeping understatement","Let me start by saying after arriving from Casablanca and a brief stop in Rabat I was ready to unwind. I booked Funky Fes on a whim based on the review's. Imagine my surprise when phoned the hostel too inquire about where I might park my car for the evening.... The reception said I have no idea I'll have to find out. Que 5 minutes later and I had already driven in circles and sorted it out myself. I brought my bag up to check in and was underwhelmed by the lobby, staff the fact that they're was no mention of the doors locking at 1 AM. For many other reasons I won't list, I was frazzled on the verge of booking a hotel. I remembered googling best welcoming hostel in Medina, Fez. Hostel Verus got raving reviews on several blog posts. I phoned the number on their site. Not…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,Best hostel so far,"We found this hostel by accident, after passing the blue gate. When we arrived we were first invited for a tea and to relax. The common room is as pretty as the images show and there are heaters all day when it is cold. The dormitories are really nice as well, with really comfortable beds and nice shower and toilet. The breakfast is included and one of the best ones we had so far. Plus, the WiFi works really well. Achmed, who works at the hostel, gave us a lot of local tips and tricks where to go and how to go there.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,Lovely!,"Didn't have a hostel booked and spontaniously came across the Verus. They took us in with open arms and were extremely hospitable. Their motto: hospitality first, buisness later. We had an extremely relaxing time after many hectic nights in Marroco :)",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,Most comfortable Hostel I’ve Stayed In,"This is a fantastic location located within steps of the beautiful Blue Gate of Fes. Our check-in was very smooth, and the staff helped us navigate the busy medina. They met us at the Batha station nearby, the drop-off from our desert trip, within 2 minutes notice (our driver gave them a call to make sure he can drop us off close). The beds were very comfortable, the main area is quiet, cozy, and has a great atmosphere. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Washing and drying service available and also very quick and effective. Great wifi signal if needed. Heating in the winter and AC in the summer. We’re very happy with our stay!",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,Best hostel in our trip,"I traveled for 3 weeks, probably 7 hostels, and this was the best one by far. Beautiful Riad-style architecture, awesome rooms, and the other travelers were great. Free breakfast and an amazing one (you'll agree with me once you try it). The people from there were really helpful, I recommend it greatly, you won't regret staying here.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,A gem in Fes!,"I found this place by sheer luck from a couple of other travelers (so glad I did) after spending three days on a Sahara Desert excursion. Firstly, they welcomed us with a great feeling of catharsis (after spending 6 hours in a van) and tea. I truly appreciated the moments to just collect myself from the hustle and bustle of traveling and gaining my bearings. Secondly, the place itself is artwork and so warm. The fountain on the first floor provides a natural sound that aims to ease anyone's stresses, worries, and the alike. In the evenings, they bring out heaters to further provide a more comfortable experience. I certainly felt I was in a state of lux and relaxation. Thirdly, the staff were equally helpful and warm for any questions you have. They provided a map with…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,5,Lively and comfortable riad,"This riad is more like a dormitory/hostel style. And the environment, decoration are really nice. The rooftop is a great place to see the old medina cityscape and of course the sunrise and sunset. I ordered dinner from here since I was tired to walk around, and I did not regret my decision. The lamb tajine is really delicious. Breakfast was so-so for me but it was still nice. (My great breakfast is always with eggs - there was not any eggs. but the bread are sufficient to start the day). The hosts - nuur, ahmed and the rest of the crew were really friendly and welcoming. They made us feel like at home.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,Incredible stay,"We stayed in that nice little guest house with my friend in our trip to Fes. It looks so beautiful inside, like in the eastern dream that you can see in the movies about Morocco. Just in the heart of Medina, and we felt like a locals. And the hosts were really gentle, helping us with luggage, they even served the breakfast at 5 in the morning, because we left early. They also advised the local hammam. Usually tourists pay a lot for hammam, but our hosts made it just 12€ and that was super nice. Я очень рекомендую этот гест хаус, уже много где побывала но никогда ещё не получала такой сервис всего за 800 руб за ночь! Отель прямо как с открыток, внутри есть фонтан и что очень важно отопление и горячая вода! В других местах это встречается здесь не часто. Ожидала простой хостел, а…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 December 2019,5,Great hostel!!,"One of the best hostels I’ve ever stayed in! This is a great place to meet people. The staf is super friendly and helpful. They organize a free dinner which is amazing. Other reviews saying that the boss of the hostel is disrespectful towards women is absolutely not true. He was always helpful, never came into the rooms and tried to make everyone feel welcome. As a woman I had an amazing time in this hostel and never felt uncomfortable.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 December 2019,5,Thank you for the nice time!,"I stayed with a friend and can absolutely recommend Riad Verus. The hostel is run by a lovely family that reads every wish from your lips. The breakfast is included and they also offer homemade dishes. Try the Tajine and pastry! The location is great (quite and central) and only minutes away from various POI and shops. Visited Marokko several times and having seen the differences, I’m very thankful for the rich service and unforgettable hospitality.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes

It's a family business and the guys who run the place and the owner were extremely kind and helpful on my part unlike what some other reviews mentioned which later I found out that they were written out revenge and despise and they all have the same story, I can confirm that this place is safe for female solo travelers like me and that nobody pushed me to partake in any tour I didn't want. On a positive note if you're lucky enough once a week they riad organizes a family dinner which…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,4,Beautiful hostel!,The central room of the hostel was beautiful with all the traditional Moroccan decor. Great for photos!! The hostel provided free breakfast which was nice to save some money and had a variety to choose from. There was live music and the rooftop terrace would be amazing in the warmer months. It was conveniently located in the Medina and easy to find. Definitely more of a lively hostel with a party vibe.,Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,3,Great Hostel But staff are intense,"This hostel is aesthetically quite beautiful, and close to the blue gate and medinas. It’s clean and the rooftop terrace offers a great view but the staff, particular the owner is very intense. We felt like they were quite pushy, wanting us to stay and eat at their hostel rather than go out and explore Fes which just seemed odd. They were constantly reminding us to leave a review and checking in on us to ensure that we’d given them 5 stars on TripAdvisor. Aside from the staff being a bit over the top it is a good hostel, would be better if they eased up on the guests more.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,5,Awesome Hostel,"Hospitable staff, beautiful riad and central location in the Médina!

There was also free breakfast which helps for saving some dollars on shopping!",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,1,Beware the owner - Not for solo travelers,"The hostel is beautiful but there are some problems: water leaks and sometimes bugs. But to be frank the worst problem is the owner. Known as Noor he will try to sell you overpriced trips. He is really pushy and if you don’t book it he turn to be agressivo. The desert trip is not what he show you. You will not go to the places he told, or will just be it the entrance of the town, take a photo and need to go, cause the driver won’t wait for more. We paid 250€. Some people booked the same trip in other hostels and paid 125€ We also noticed - and some girls in the hostel told us - that the owner frequently harass girls. Specially lone travelers. All these information can be verified in other reviews.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,5,Riad Verus: A Home Away from Home,"Riad Verus was an amazing place to stay for our time in Fes. They welcome you with refreshing mint tea in a beautifully decorated lobby. They have a kitchen as well that serves delicious Moroccan cuisine. The best part about this Riad is that it is family run, so they make you feel like family and are always making sure to keep you comfortable. 10/10 would recommend!",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,5,Amazing stay!,"I absolutely loved my time at Riad Verus! The moment I walked in the door, Noor welcomed me to the family style dinner in one of the most picturesque places in Fes! I came in December, and I was worried the place would be cold, but on the contrary, the common room, the bathrooms, and the room itself was very warm! The water pressure was great and the water was pleasingly warm. The place is also great because you can be social if you’d like or you can enjoy time to yourself! Overall, the staff and the accommodation deserve a huge kudos for their friendliness, and comfort! I’ll be staying in Riad Verus soon! Thank you!!",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,5,The Perfect Riad in your Budget! It exists!,"I fell in love with Riad Verus! Honestly the best hostel or best Riad in Fes, or anywhere...it’s so nice. For a budget traveler, this completely exceeds all other options. The Riad is beautifully designed - I couldn’t help but take some photos each time I passed a view of the common area. There’s also a lovely terrace with an amazing view. The free breakfast is huge! Location perfect and the staff was so kind and accommodating. They presented a huge group dinner for us all on Christmas Eve (which of course is not celebrated in Morocco so what a kind thing to do). Hot showers, comfortable dorms...I will stay here again and recommend to everyone.",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,5,A Must Stay for Couples Travelling!,"My partner and I were first time travellers to Morocco, with our only stop being in Fes. After extensive research through many hostels and hotels, we landed on Riad Verus. It was an easy sell- many great reviews and the pictures of the Riad were beautiful. Upon arrival we were pleasantly treated with mint tea in the main room while we waited to be checked in (which we soon learned is plentiful at any time of the day). The owner was there with a smile and a friendly demeanour. The pictures did the Riad justice, it’s gorgeous. We stayed in a private room and were able to upgrade for a minimal fee to the most beautiful private hostel room we’ve ever stayed in. The staff were accommodating, getting us more pillows and blankets as it is winter and a bit chilly. The owner, Noor was…",Riad_Verus-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Verus,Fes_Fes_Meknes
