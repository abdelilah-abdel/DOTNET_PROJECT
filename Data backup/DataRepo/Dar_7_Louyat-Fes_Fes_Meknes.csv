 January 2023,5,Lovely hotel!,"We were very happy with the hotel, the staff and the food! The beautiful riad is located in the center of the medina but in a quite street.

 February 2022,5,What a find !!,"I was fortunate enough to stay here for four weeks. Everything about my time was perfect. Firstly the Riad itself is beautiful, traditional, spotlessly clean, quiet, lovely terrace, hugely comfortable bed, a well stocked library and in a great location. The food was of a high standard, lovingly prepared, delicious and extremely generous portions. However it was the staff who made my trip so exceptional and memorable. I was traveling alone but was made to feel part of their family. My daily questions were answered and I gained an incredible insight into the local life and the culture of Fez. I cannot think of any negatives. I feel exceptionally privileged and lucky to have found this amazing place.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2023,5,Wonderful stay!,We had the fortune to spend 2 beautiful nights in this Riad. The rooms were spacious and clean and the house itself is stunning! Everything was made better by the warm welcome of Soufiane and his team!! I would recommend this place hands down!,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2022,5,Incredible Riad tucked away in an ancient city,"Once you enter this wonderful haven you’ll have trouble just not wanting to stay inside its walls. The on-site staff went above and beyond in accommodating my every need. The manager, Safyan, himself met me at my late-arriving taxi from the airport to help guide the way from the R’Cif gate thru the winding streets. Without his assistance my stay would have been impossible. I had the luxury of being the only guest on the weekend of my stay, I was treated to amazing meals provided by Fatima, their cook, whose cooking was the highlight of my Moroccan trip. For Western/European travelers not familiar with medians, particularly those of this age, you should be aware of streets often being small narrow alleys. The Riad is on the house of 7 Turns so expect to be following this path…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2022,5,Excellent place to stay in Fez!,"I spent a couple of nights in this wonderful guest house in Fez. Quiet and very close to all interesting sites in the medina. Rooms are very unique and the food is also very good. Service is also great, in particular Sufyan the manager is very helpful and can speak several languages. A place I will certainly return if I am ever back to Fez.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2022,5,Incredible Place to Stay in Fes,Staying at Dar7 Louyat was one of the main reasons why our visit to Fes was an incredible experience. The location centrally located. The interior and the design were immaculate. The place is super quiet and peaceful which made it the perfect place to go back to after spending time in the medina. Starting each day with the wonderful breakfast sitting in the middle of the beautiful interior courtyard was wonderful. The service was great and the manager of the hotel Sufyan was super friendly and helpful. I was amazing at how many languages he speaks including Mandarin Chinese. I would recommend this place to all my family and friends. 住這裡真的是很棒. 裡面乾淨又很安靜. 室內 保留了 非常美麗的傳統設計 加上現代的設備. 管理人Sufyan 非常的親切又會講中文. 給我們一個很美好的回憶. 我 一定會建議我家人朋友在這裡住!,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2022,5,Beautiful accommodations at Dar 7 Louyat,"The riad is lovely; a wonderful place to stay in the old part of the Medina.

 September 2022,5,Most immersive guesthouse experience you can have,"If harmony and balance live in one place, it is in this riad. From the location, decoration, to the people, to the venue itself and his soul, which cannot be created however, here, you can feel it in every detail. A magical space in the heart of the medina, which connects us with Fez and with ourselves, in a balance that I have rarely felt while travelling. Younes, the manager is friendly, dedicated, and helpful, turning the experience even more local and immersive with his tips and recommendations. It's easy to feel welcomed and hugged and at the same time completely out of our comfort zone, in a place that seems stopped in time. Extra points also for the manager's musical taste that helps to make the stay even more magical and unforgettable. Thanks Younes, Fatima and all…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2022,5,Lovely riad in Fez - highly recommended,"Our stay at Dar 7 Louyat was one of the best we had during our 10 days in Morocco. The rooms and building are stunning, as are the Medina views from the terrace. The location is great to visit the Medina, central but calm. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, and the food served within the riad was the most delicious we had in Fez. Dinner and/or lunch at the riad are highly recommended.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2022,5,loved this place,i spent 3 nights at Dar7Louyat and i felt more than comfortable there (while traveling alone). The Staff was suuuuper highly friendly and the manager Younes was always the kindest person being helpful & available for questions etc. I enjoyed the calm nights and having breakfast & dinner on the roof terasse. I‘ll definitely come back to this beautiful place.,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2019,5,A wonderful birthday venue,"I spent a few wonderful days at Dar 7 Louyat to celebrate a big birthday with a group of friends. The riad was the best possible choice and everyone was delighted with their own beautiful room. We had an amazing birthday meal and there was even a special birthday cake. It was the perfect place to rest after a long walk through the ancient city of Fes, exploring the medina and coming back with all sorts of things that are on offer. Dar Louyat was supremely comfortable and we were told all about its history by Mohammed who was also very helpful showing us some special places to visit. Altogether an unforgettable experience which I hope to repeat one of these days.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2019,2,Looks nice but really disappointed,"The only good thins is that the place looks really nice and the pics are accurate. But honestly, was disappointed by the service. They charged for the tourist map that in every other place I've stayed was free. Every other place in Morocco greeted one with complimentary mint tea at check in. They charged for it. They managed to not have mint tea the rest of our stay. (Don't know how a place in Morocco doesn't have mint tea). Our room wasn't cleaned on the last day of our stay. We had to check and recheck about ordering a taxi to the train station. On the good side, the night manager seemed to be on top of things and helpful. But otherwise, it seemed like there were no adults in charge. I can only speculate that's because the owner lives in France and was not around. …",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2019,5,"Homey, with great food","My dinner here was a highlight of my trip -- wonderful home-cooked food, with a really nice range of little salads, good variety beyond what I'd usually been getting in restaurants. I think I might have been the only guest the night I stayed, which made the place a bit magical feeling! Very comfortable bed, and I loved the lightbox artwork in my room. I personally was glad not to have a/c, because I prefer not to use it--especially in these houses, which are designed to stay cool. (My room had a big floor-stand fan.) But I'm mentioning it because other people might be expecting it, and fault the place for not having it.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,4,Amazing location,We received a very warm welcome from Rida where the taxi had dropped us off. This Riad is stunningly beautiful. Rida even took our extremely large luggage up the stairs to our room and informed us on times for breakfast. The standard room was well STANDARD! The room itself needs a little love and attention and a bit of decorative warmth. Bed is very squeaky. The bed has more squeak than Bubble and Squeak!! Would recommend ear plugs so you can’t hear the squeak every time you turnover. Room seems neglected but nonetheless comfortable and almost soundproof and pitch black. Best night sleep we’ve had since we arrived in Morocco. The bathroom was beautiful. Very quirky. The shower was great. Breakfast was delicious and served on time every morning. The staff are amazingly…,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2019,4,Fabulous place to stay,The riad is well within the medina and a good job we were collected form outside the medina as we might have had a problem finding it. The taxi to and from the airport was organised by the riad and all went well. The food in the evening was very good but we were the only ones dining but ok. We went out around Fes for most of the day and relaxed on the roof area in the sun in the late afternoon. The staff were very attentive Eunice and Red ( apologies for the spelling but he did body building ) they were both very good and Red organised some beers and wine for us which were very welcome. The room we had was big and very comfortable no problems at all Lovely place to stay and a true oasis a beautiful riad.,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2019,1,Over rated - scope to improve a lot,"One reason for the low mark is to a degree the fault of the high ratings this hotel has received in the past, which boosted our expectations. Firstly let us say the property is beautiful, the cooking is excellent and the welcome was just what you needs all of which deserve five stars. However too many other things that let this hotel down. 1. Comfort - the room we had was small and the beds, especially the spare bed was extremely uncomfortable 2. The design of the Raid means that when other guests wake up you wake up - not ideal when you haven't slept well. Unfortunately this also applies at night and you have to listen to singing of other guests as you try to sleep. 3. People describe the Riad as peaceful and quiet, but we had a lot of street noise and the smell of the…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2019,5,Paradise in Fez,Our stay in Fez was a delight. Our hotel arranged for a taxi to be waiting for us at the airport. Then there was a cart waiting to bring us to Dar 7 Louyat. Dar 7 Louyat is located in the old Medina. Rich with history. Dar 7 Louyat is in it self an oasis. Stunning to see and a pleasure to rest our bones from the long walks of the day. We were greeted by Soufiane Dayi. A well informed and charming expert at Dar 7 Louyat. He was very friendly and helpful to us. He helped us set up very reasonable excursions during our stay. Arranged dinners at Dar 7 Louyat and even took a request from us for a dinner. The staff at Dar 7 Louyat were most reliable and friendly.

The riad is absolutely stunning, from the vaulted ceiling’s with amazing carvings to the home cooked meals and lastly the amazing hospitality. I read many reviews about how this place made you feel at home. I can honestly say staying here was the best decision I made in morocco. I particularly have to thank Sufiyan for making my stay so so memorable. From offering me his own personal hand lotion to bring me a guitar from home, I do not have enough nice things to say about him. He really made the place feel like home. Cannot give this place more than five stars unfortunately, otherwise I’d give it 10.

The staff were super helpful and kind, really catering to our every request. Delicious homecooked dinners (especially the chicken tajine). The terrace.has places to sit out and enjoy a superb view over the medina. We slept in the rooms next to the patio - everything super clean and well-cared for.

 February 2019,4,Beautiful Dar,"The Dar is beautiful and the courtyard is traditional with intricate detail giving a nice ambience. We booked a superior room on the 3rd floor - this room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was great with amenities! A tip: The one window in this room was very tiny and the wooden roof was a bit low giving it a very claustrophobic feeling, however, I think other rooms in the Dar are larger and have big windows so I would recommend you book one of those rooms. The location is pretty central and we did not get lost so don't be discouraged about the location. We had somewhat of an average experience with the night staff.

To best describe my stay, I can simply say I have rarely been as well looked after anywhere in Morocco as in Dar 7 Louyat. From the first moment following your luggage as it winds through the streets of the medina of Fes to your final good-bye, the staff makes you feel totally at home and taken under their wing. Naima and Rachid attend to every need, and Khadija delights you with traditional Fassi home cooking, known to be the best in Morocco.

I visited Fes for the first time and my stay in this Riad made the trip feel like I returned home every night. The staff at the Riad way really friendly and the food the best I’ve had in Morocco. The room was really big and had an extra bed. The Riad is really close to all the souks.

 April 2018,5,"Getting to the hotel, is not its selling point, but you'll love staying there","We arrived in Fez airport at dusk, and we were picked up by our bus and our guide. We were a group of 18 people, both adults and kids aged 10-12yo. We were taken first to a restaurant immediately after arriving and we finally arrived at the entrance of the medina, quite late (for our travelling standards), that is past 11pm. I had checked that the hotel was well inside the medina and no vehicle can get near there. So, upon getting off the bus, our guide helped us hire too ""karossas"", namely hand-drawn ""trolleys"" who loaded all our luggage and started walking to the hotel.

The ladies who take care of the place immediately greeted us with the biggest and warmest smiles, and the customary mint tea. The manager (who spoke perfect English) took the time to walk us through just enough of the basics for our first night and because we were exhausted from our trip, left the rest of the details for the following morning.

 December 2017,5,Charming guesthouse but don't expect to find it without help,"I foolishly overlooked the instructions sent to me by Bertrand, the French doctor who owns the guesthouse, about arriving at Dar 7 Louyat. Arriving in the medina by taxi, I tried to find a path through the labyrinth of small streets. Almost impossible. The ""louyat"" in the name means ""turnings"". There are seven of them, and that's AFTER you find the Place es-Sefarrine, itself no mean feat. There are signs to the guesthouse but these are only really useful as reference once you already know the way. So my advice is, do not follow my example. The manager, Rachid, will be happy to arrange an escort for you. Once you have been shown the way, it will be easier to find it yourself a second time. What can you expect in the guesthouse?

The building's restoration has been done very nicely. We were greeted warmly. Our room was very clean and cozy. Nice bed, separate dressing room and very nice bathroom. Our favorite part: The staff!

 January 2017,5,Perfect birthday weekend,"One word, awesome! I had a perfect 4 night stay at Dar 7 Louyat. A beautiful hidden gem. So quiet and peaceful. I'm so in love with this place. The rooftop was amazing! Naima and Rachid was such a sweetheart. Can't wait to be back..",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2017,5,Beautiful old raid in Fes,"This hotel is a very old traditional and beautiful raid in the medina in Fes , everything is very clean and order , the interior is really amazing and the view on the roof is also very nice . the staff there are also very nice people . only thing not so good is the location , though it is near the main gate however it is too deep in the short lane and the lane is very dark in the night , it will be hard to find the way in the night . Anyway it is a very beautiful and nice raid . it is a good choice for travellers who interested in the traditional raids in morocco . recommend it to everyone who will travel to Fes",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,4,Beautiful hidden Gem,"The place is amazing, very traditional decor. Not for you if you're looking for a place with all the mod-cons but is great if you're looking for an authentic, traditional Moroccan experience. The people were very helpful. Rachid was great with helping out in terms of what to see and where to go, Naema was a fantastic help and super friendly. When my son fell sick she walked us to the nearest pharmacy. The food that was prepared was delicious! All in all a great stay and would definitely recommend.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Perfection,We were met by the owner's sister nearby and personally escorted back to the beautiful Riad. The initial experience upon entering the Riad was breathtaking. There were several gas powered heaters running so the atrium was warm and cozy. It was obvious that a lot of attention went into making the guest experience comfortable. The cook and riad attendants were very sweet and took care of all our needs and wishes. The rooms were amazing and roomy. One of the most comfortable beds/room we stayed in during our 3 week tour of Morocco. The meals prepared on sight were done with TLC and with a lot of pride. Great location topped off our experience; easy to get in and easy to get out.,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Three days with great experience with great host!,"Stayed here for three days, great host and great chef cooking Moroccan dinner - there's no menu, but everyday is different depending on what's in the kitchen:). Breakfast is included and it always feels like a king/queens serving. The host are Raschid, Naima, and Hardijia. Although I don't speak French, they are super friendly and helped me with all the trips arrangement and tour guide. After a couple days in other cities in Morocco, I always had the feeling that everyone is trying to cheat me until I met this lovely people at this Riad. Three days two nights with them, as a solo traveler, they become friends. I am very grateful and I will recommend all my friends to come here as well, whether you are with family, solo traveler or a couple.

 October 2016,5,Unforgettable stay at Dar 7 Louayat - recommended,"We were a party of 4 that spent a few days in the best accommodation we found in Morocco. The Service offered is top notch: Rasheed came to pick us up outside the Medina and helped us with the luggage. The personnel is kind and cheerful. We were offered a warm welcome, with tea and a chat in a sumptuous Palace. The restored Riad is just awesome with splendid middle ages features. Hisham and her mum turned out to be awesome chefs, and we happened to eat in twice in 3 days. The food was fresh, varied, generous in terms of quanties and stylish at the same time. We were totally satisfied with that. The rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated with spectacular Moroccan bathrooms in respect of the traditional features. We really felt at home and totally relaxed, with a good…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,5,The perfect place in Fes!!,"I have to admit this is my first review, but this time it is not possible to share with others the amazing experience we had at Dar Louyat 7. Everything was simply perfect, the perfect mix of availability and discretion very difficult to find, and very much appreciated. We arrived late in the evening in Fes when it was already dark, and fortunately Rochdi came and pick us up, it is better to have an experienced guide for the impact with the Medina after the sunset. Entering in the Riad was really an experience, everything is so beautiful, peaceful and clean. We were alone in the Riad and we stayed in big room cosy and colourful. Everything was perfect, and I believe I want to spend some more few words for Nahima and Khdija: they’ve been absolutely amazing, preparing the best…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,5,Amazing historically renovated Riad in old Medina -Fes,"The experience was fantastic: Food (the cooking was the best we've experienced in Morocco), attention to guests and riad in itself were all excellent. Staff was very helpful, friendly and honestly concerned about our well being. The riad is located centrally in old Medina. After several trips to Fes, this is the best and more authentic place that i've seen. We would stay here again for sure and we highly recommend this Riad to anyone visiting Fes.!!",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2016,5,Absolutely Perfect!,"Staying at Dar 7 Louyat absolutely made our stay in Fes. Rochdi met us in the square nearby and brought us to the Riad. There is absolutely no way we would have found it in the maze of Fes. It is imperative that you arrange a pick up with the Riad prior to your arrival! Rochdi also arranged a walking tour for us through the maze of Fes which was great. I have a really good sense of direction but still got lost because street names change, Gates are closed at various hours of the day and everyone on the street tries to tell you things are closed or in the other direction. Given the hecticness of the city we were so thankful for being able to return to the Riad to relax and cool down. As it was August and crazy hot, we were the only guests. We were graciously upgraded us to a…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2016,5,Stunning restored riad with impeccable hospitality,"I couldn't recommend this riad more. It's located very conveniently; about 8 minutes walking from Place R'cif where you can easily direct your petit taxi or find a ride to the new city, airport, or train station. The riad is close to the Dar Seffarine, the traditional copper crafting area, as well as University al-Qarawiyyin, the oldest university in the world. Like many in Morocco the medina in Fes is dusy, overcrowded, and especially bustling at night. Unlike in Marrakech, there is no motorized traffic in the medina which makes for a bit less stress when walking about. The real beauty of Morocco lies behind garden doors and this riad takes the cake. When you walk in, you're greeted with an incredibly well and sensitively restored home covered in beautiful tile work and…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,"Beautiful Riad; gorgeous food, lovely people!","A really beautiful riad in the centre of the old medina; lovely roof terrace; the staff are really helpful & friendly, & the food is some of THE best I've ever tasted in 15 trips to Morocco! The house has been beautifully restored in traditional style & the rooms are all spacious with lovely bathrooms.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2016,5,Splendiferous Riad in the Heart of Fez,"with it's impressive traditional moroccan architecture, carefully restored and supplemented with modern details Dar7Loyuat truly stands out amongst the numerous guesthouses in the medina of Fez, though thremedous beauty and comfort is by far not everything the house has to offer... a lovely and highly professional team attentively takes care of it's guests 24 hours during their stay. Excellent meals cooked by the kitchen staff are available at demand at reasonable prices.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2016,5,A Palace!,"As other reviewers have indicated, the route to the riad is a little disorienting ...BUT once you step foot inside the riad you find yourself in a beautiful palace! We were lucky enough to have the whole riad to ourselves (with friends) and it was a real privilege! The food was sublime and Hisham was a superb host. Super friendly and hospitable. We had young children in the party and the riad was like a fairytale castle to them. Stay here - It is wonderful. (...and order dinner if possible!)",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,Excellent service and Riad,My wife and two children loved this Riad. The service was excellent and the manger Mohammed was accommodating. The local supervisor who Hameed was extremely helpful and nice and was willing to go out of his way to help. The room was cozy and nice and would recommend anyone to stay here. The view from the terrace was great.,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2016,5,Very nice,"Very nice, very charming Moroccan atmosphere, clean, a big roof terrace with a panoramic view all around the Medina. Good breakfast. You are in the middle of Fes Medina. The main point of interest in Fes. Staff came to take us from one of the gate of the Medina to the riad. The Medina maze is disconcerting the first hours, even more at night, then you get used to it and recognize the streets. Streets of the Medina are dusty, perhaps not the best romantic plan but you get something authentic of the Muslim culture.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2016,5,Beautiful oasis,"The Dar is beautifully decorated, the food is delicious and well priced, the management is great. Our room was a double room off of the main quart yard, and was comfortable and warm in January. I would recommend booking Batoul or Rafia suites. They offer more privacy. The roof top terrace is beautiful at night and day. The street leading to the Dar looks a bit sketchy but we found it totally safe day and night. Special thanks to Hisham for making our stay amazing.",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2016,5,The Most Amazing Oasis in Amazing Fez,"Dar 7 Louyat is located close the gate of Fez marina, convenient to reach almost everything but more important is it offers a cozy retreat from all the people, color, smell, and sounds of the marina. The architecture itself is amazing, manager Mohammed said they spent about 10 years in refurbishment; the details and the mixture between new and old are impressive. Also love their super fluffy & warm comforter! Manager and other staff are all super friendly, besides useful travel tips of Fez, they also provided a lot of information for traveling around Morocco (since Mr. Mohammed himself is a travel expert too haha). Will definitely visit again and try the home-cooking Moroccan cuisine of the hotel!",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes

We were travelling 2 couples, often out the all day for our siteseeing trips, Mohammed arranged twice a very intimate and lovable home-made dinner for us 4. It was amazing to have all the riad for us, as it was our own home down in Fes. The riad is also a piece of art itself, the bathroom in the room is the best part!",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2016,5,Cozy place to stay in Fez,The manager Mohammad is excellent helpful and friendly. Provided us the wonderful home while we would traveling. Especially the service!

 July 2015,5,Beautiful base from which to explore Fez,"Lovely house. Gorgeous rooms , especially the bathrooms! Abdul took care of us really really well. Feeding us great food.

 December 2014,4,Short Stay in Fes,"Unfortunately, I planned only one night in Fes. This was my first trip to Morocco and was doing a quick tour of the country before planning my next visit. Simi, Abdu,Myriam, and Naïma are the wonderful staff at this newly owned Riad. The new owner, Bertrand, had just opened it at the beginning of December. You would never know it though. Not a thing was out of place, not a misstep by anyone. Professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. I regret not being able to stay longer. Dinner and breakfast were delicious. Sipping a Moroccan rose was a nice surprise. I chose to travel in December and realize that buildings in Morocco were designed for the 7 months of relentless heat and not for keeping me warm in the cooler months. It is very difficult to find so be sure to contact Simi or…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2014,5,A hidden jewell,"We stayed at the Dar 7 Louyat for 4 nights over New Year's Eve with our 3 year old daughter. Having visited Marocco a few times over the past 15 years, we have never encountered such magnificent accomodation. The building, its architecture and the loving and respectful restoration and decoration it has undergone make the experience equivalent to staying in one of the city's medersas or palaces. The experience of islamic architecture in all its spendor is unmatchable. The riad is nestled in one of the key áreas in Fes, very close to the Qairayuine Mosque, so you can enjoy all the city's vibration and the extreme peace and quiet of the riad. We used the transfer to and from the airport that was offered through the riad and iot proved useful and hassle-free. Breakfast was served…",Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes

Cancelling our room late minute was not a problem. We found that very understanding. Difficult to find though.,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2014,5,A little palace in the Medina,The locaction and interior of the Riad is absolutely beautiful. It is decorated very tastefully and is not over decorated like other Riads. It is a perfect hideaway in the busy Medina of Fez. The food served by Miryam is very good and way better than in any restaurant we have tried during our stay. The medina of Fez beats any medina we have ever seen in other cities. It woud be good if there would always be somebody around who speaks at least some English. WiFi didn't work in our room on the top floor at all.,Dar_7_Louyat-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_7_Louyat,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2014,5,Fantastic architecture,"It is a lovely hotel, located in the Medina, near the Great Mosque Quaraouiyine. It is very beautiful, each detail and decoration are incredible.

The building itself is a testament to the hosts' passion for art history and commitment to traditional crafts, materials and techniques, as well as to their passion for true hospitality. The courtyard is a museum quality restoration and each of the rooms is a unique blend of Moroccan decor, with touches of Mid-Century Modern. We were greeted by the manager, Simohammed, who throughout our stay, was friendly, informative and imminently available when we had questions or needed any guidance regarding the medina. He is a great asset to the Dar 7 Louyat.

The restoration is done with sensitive attention to architectural details and a flare for classical Moroccan interiors. Located near the great Mosque Qaraouiyine, thus easily identifiable to a lost traveler.
