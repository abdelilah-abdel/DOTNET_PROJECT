 December 2022,5,Absolutely perfect!,Came here with my friend after doing 4 days in Marrekch and was definitely the perfect balance to the busy city. It’s about 30-45 min outside of the Fes Medina but don’t let that stop you from coming. The owner is incredibly helpful in accommodating and planning trips in and out of the Medina and scheduling guided tours. He arranged a fantastic Medina tour for us one day with Farida (an incredible guide) and also a day in Bhalil with a local guide there as well. The staff is super accommodating and the meals were some of the best meals I’ve ever had. The view is absolutely incredible and the rooms are up to date and brand new. Overall 10/10 and can’t wait to come back here again!,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,hotelName,city

 November 2022,5,Oasis of tranquility,"Dar el Mandar is a true oasis of tranquility and hospitality nestled away into a mountain side with a stunning view of Fez and the surrounding plains. The property is designed with great attention to detail - minimalism paired with traditional Moroccon style. It is elegant and luxurious, but down to earth at the same time. We spent 2 nights here to enjoy a full-day break of relaxation, sandwiched into an otherwise pretty packed itinerary of exploring Morocco. We couldn’t have been happier with our decision. Dar el Mandar was the perfect place to find some peace and quiet, and to recharge our batteries before diving back into the bustle of Fez. The rooms are clean and tastefully furnished, the staff was extremely attentive and they served excellent food as well.

The house and many “chilling spots” are set so that you’re never missing out on the view and are always looking at the mountain or the beautiful sunset. Then you have the rooms and the equipment: all very cozy and modern despite the rustic ambiance. Yes, the WI-FI is not the best but that’s normal given that you are on a mountain in a secluded rural area! As for the food, all meals are made with love using fresh local ingredients and herbs from the garden. You will also get to enjoy a lovely olive oil tasting with drinks and freshly baked bread!

Javed, the owner, is a very welcoming host (English is limited but we got by with my poor French) and looked after us very well. Fatima who works in the kitchen is a fantastic cook and we couldn't fault the meals that were prepared for us. This is not a budget option but it was worth every penny. There are plans to develop what…",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2016,5,A wonderful retreat with great hospitality,"I stayed at this wonderful, small hotel with my wife, 2 daughters and 2 of their friends for 2 nights. We had a great stay and were looked after magnificently by Jaoued and his small staff. Dar El Mandar is essentially a lovely 3 bedroom house with staff. The staff couldn't be more accommodating and the views are simply outstanding. The house sits near the top of hills that overlook the flatlands below and the views reach to Fes and the hills to the North and West beyond; simply stunning. The house has a fabulous swimming pool to cool off in, 3 Berber tents to relax in and an outside dining area. All allow you to enjoy the wonderful views. Each bedroom well appointed with large, comfortable beds and ensuite facilities and all open out into a communal living area with a…",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,Heaven in fes,"Wow . . . . Such a great and beautiful place! Enjoying the sunset under one of the berber tents sipping a beer or tea with homegrown mint is just super relaxing.

It's only a short drive from Fes, but a world away - with great food, super-friendly service and stunning views over the plains. We spent a blissful afternoon with happy kids splashing in the pool while we ate, slept and chatted in the sun - wonderful.",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes

 May 2016,5,Exceptional place,"Really an idyllic place to relax but also for hiking and visit towns/villages such as Sefrou and Bhalil as they are just 20 min away by car. The personnell and the owner are very friendly and will help you with everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The owner arranged a visit to Bhalil on market day (Wednesday) whereby we had lunch with the family of one of his cooks Lamia (this was very nice and interesting and above all the lunch was awesome!). We didn't have a hired car, but this was no problem as Jaoued (owner) or the other staff could arrange a local taxi for very reasonable prices.",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,"Beautiful place, nice staff.","It's a very nice place on the coutryside near Fes. Ideal to relax. The staff is really frendly and the ownwer is worried about anything you need.

There is also an small swimming pool, and a very nice garden.",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2015,5,Amazing Oasis of Calm and Beauty,"If you're visiting Fez, you MUST stop by Dar El Mandar for at least one night. It's peaceful, secluded and you're guaranteed to have a magical time.

 April 2016,5,A relaxing and comfortable place with view on Fez,"We received much attention from host and personnel from start till end. We really felt at home in this relaxing place. We arrived after a long but drive coming from Toghdra valley all over Imilchil. We were expected, always feels good, received a warm welcome and immediately enjoyed our tea in the Berber tent with panoramic view and sunset.. Later a tasteful diner was served. The next day Jaoued helped us a lot in preparing our visit to Fez. Thanks to his great advices we had a wonderful day in Fez. The next day we relaxed in the pleasant environment. Dar El Mandar offered the comfort –in and around the house- we like. Thank you !",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,4,Lovely views and hospitable welcome,"My wife, baby daughter and I stayed at Dar El Mandar at the end of March for a two night stay. The views are amazing, the pool, gardens and surroundings are gorgeous and Fatima and Alae were very helpful and hospitable. The location of the house is great, with good walks to be had in the hills around. There were a few things that we thought could be improved - hot water in the shower didn't last long, with no shower gel / toiletries, the house was a little cold and despite Fatima's cooking being absolutely delicious, the price of 25Euros per head does seem extortionate, when the same food is available in Fes for a fraction of the price. Overall though, a great stay.",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,The perfect escape to paradise,"Dar el Mandar is perfect, the accommodation is very comfortable and with only three rooms it can never be too crowded. The staff think of ways to improve your stay before the thought ever comes to your head. The food is great, traditional and cooked with care, they make bread in the outdoor berber oven before dinner and serve it with local olive oil, simply delicious. They will light an open fire inside or bring blankets to the outdoor berber tent for an evening of chatting with friends. There's a hill to climb behind the guesthouse with peaceful views of the surrounding mountains and then of course there's the pool with view of Fès. The price is very reasonable for the standard of accommodation, food and service. Enjoy!",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,An Oasis just outside Fes,"My wife and I have stayed at Dar El Mandar twice and we have not been disappointed. The accommodation itself is very comfortable, with great food and service. The hotel offers a fantastic pool area and outdoor dinning facilities which all have sweeping views of the surrounding area. Further, there are a number of scenic walking trails surrounding the hotel which provide a first hand glimpse of local life in the area and provide beautiful views of the surrounding mountains and fields. I would recommend Dar El Mandar to anyone staying in the Fes area and who want a break from the hustle of the Medina.",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2015,5,A gorgeous experience,"We spent the day at this beautiful bed and breakfast/resort outside of Fez. It was way out in the country, on a hilltop with fantastic views. The property was Berber- inspired; the house right out of Architectural Digest. Every inch was attractive. The pool and outside restaurant were absolutely lovely. The owner was charming. We didn't stay there but we checked out the rooms which were quite gorgeous and immaculate. I would definitely recommend staying there or at least spending the day.",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2015,5,A pradise in the earth!!!,"It was an absolute amazing experience to visit Dar El Mandar. It was our day off, me and my freinds in Fez was thinking about what to do that day, we met another freind who has recomended that place for us, really we spent a lovely day there, swiming, eating organic food and enjoying the nature. Also people are very friendly there. I would do it every time again.

 October 2015,5,Magical Experience!,"We had two magical nights at Dar El Mandar, relaxing in the tent, swimming, sitting by the pool, and being provided with 5 Star service. Only 30 minutes from Fes, this retreat has three guest rooms at present (with more in the planning) so service is immediate, personal, and tailored to your every need. Service: 5 Star: Fatima is an excellent cook and even prepared special food for a sick guest. Alae made sure we had everything we needed to relax and enjoy ourselves. I took a bread making class and enjoyed myself completely. We had Berber music one night which felt very special. Location: The views are stunning, day and night. We also hiked up behind the hotel and explored the hills. Rooms: Comfortable beds and functioning plumbing - perfect for us Owner: Jaoued…",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2015,5,Hidden gem!,"If you are looking for a peaceful stay in a friendly guest house then look no further than Dar El Mendar. The views from the guest house are simply beautiful, Fatima the chef cooks the most amazing food and you will be looked after by all of the staff extremely well. We stayed in the family room which has a view of the pool and Fes City, the bed was super comfortable, one thing to note with the family room- the toilet is located outside of the main room which may bother some people, not us though. We saw the other 2 rooms and noted that the toilet is within the room. I felt what we paid was excellent value and would not hesitate to recommend a stay here.

 July 2015,5,Trésor,"While in Fez, we went to do some trekking in the Middle Atlas. On our way back to town, we stopped at Dar El Mandar for lunch. The owner greeted us at the gate and led us to the outdoor dinning with just breathtaking view. The service was wonderful and the food delicious. I still remember the aromatic fruit desert with rose and cinnamon. The owner later showed us the dar and let our kids swim in the spectacular pool. I wish we were staying there.. Full of lavender, rosemary and rose scents tucked into the side of the mountain, this felt like a treasure found. We decided to come back for dinner few days later and loved it again. At night, with the lights of Fez in the distance, dinning on the side of mountain with wind in my hair .. - it was magical",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2015,5,Wonderful place with a great view,"Don't let the sometimes steep gravel road stop you from coming here. It is more than worth it! We stayed here one night during Ramadan but that didn't dampen the amazing service we received. The owners spoke to us on the phone at our arrival as our French is terrible and their staff didn't speak English and later drove out to meet us personally. Everyone from the owners to the staff were extremely nice and helpful and Fatima's cooking was the best we've had in Morocco! I highly recommend eating dinner with them. The grounds were immaculately landscaped with a Berber tent lounge and an outdoor dining area - which we couldn't use because the wind picked up so much by dinner time. And the pool area was a great place to spend time, lounging around or swimming while…",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2015,4,"Secluded, authentic and amazing views!","My wife and I spent the night here for our 10 year anniversary. We picked Dar El Mandar because it only had three rooms and we wanted a quiet get-away. We loved the grounds which are beautifully arranged with several distinct spaces. Our favorite spot was the traditional Berber tent on the lower terrace with an amazing unobstructed sunset view. But then the pergola was perfect for meals and the pool is a welcome cool down in the summer heat. The great thing about this location is that there was always a breeze! The rooms were quite nice. However, the windows opened up to the front of the house so there was little privacy. To add to this, there was no fan or AC in the room so the only way to take advantage of the cool mountain breeze was to open the windows and slide back the…",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2015,5,A must while in Fes,"20 km from Fes, we found this charming ""farm"", restaurant and pool ... The view is absolutely stunning ! We did a walk in the surroundings to enjoy the views and deserve the lunch in the pergola; nice and peaceful... after that, a nice afternoon along the pool is just what we needed to rest and relax.. It is a one day or one night thing to do while in Fes and an excelllent way to see the countryside around Fes ... Owning myself a Dar in Fes, I will definitely recommend this place to my guests !

 March 2015,5,Most Peaceful place to relax in Morocco - Absolutely Recommended,"Originally intending to stay for only 3 nights, ended up staying for 1 week and coming back for more. An amazing place for you and your family & friends as it has everything a person seeking a peaceful journey may need. PEACE, QUIET and MEDITATION inducing stay is what awaits you at very reasonable rates with most helpful staff. The view is sublime. It has a pool to refresh yourself, delicious Moroccan food (amazing Tagine + a wide variety of Moroccan Salads with a fresh baked Arabic bread which you can enjoy its smells coming directly from the open outside traditional oven). We enjoyed as well their comfortable rooms. In the afternoon, we had our coffee with some Arabic sweets under a lovely traditional tent from where you can indulge yourself by the best view of the mountains…",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Fantastic stay in a beautiful setting,"We were looking for a hotel that would avoid the craziness of Fes, but close enough to drive in for a visit. This wonderful hotel is located about 30 minutes south of Fes and was worth every penny. The last two kilometers of the trip are on a gravel trail. Luckily, there is a sign visible on the road from both directions. This dirt road/trail can be driven by passenger cars. I felt more comfortable with the clearance of a 4WD SUV because the trail is a little sketchy in a couple spots. The gate to the property was not marked at the time, but you can look up the hillside and see the name spelled out in rocks from the trail. Up at the hotel, you will enjoy amazing views of the countryside from the entire property. We had one of the rooms for our family with two young…",Dar_El_Mandar_Farm-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Dar_El_Mandar_Farm,Fes_Fes_Meknes
