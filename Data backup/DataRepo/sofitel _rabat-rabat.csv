I also inquired about a possible manicure as well. The attendant didn‚Äôt speak English and became frustrated. I asked her for the other lady who spoke English and she got upset. She rose her voice at me and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt speak English, do you speak French?‚Äù and proceeded to speak to me in French. I told her there was no need to get mad.

 February 2020,2,Grossly overrated and outdated,This facility built in 1967 has paint falling off the walls and furnishings inside the rooms that are very worn out and outdated. The inside of the rooms smell musty and the carpets are worn out. The bathrooms have no privacy doors and the rooms are very small. The lobby is a disgrace with no smoking signs yet they allow smoking in a wide open cafe and the entire lobby reeks of a tobacco stench that make it difficult to breathe when you walk into the hotel. Its incredible that a hotel chain such as this can allow a place like this to deteriorate and charge the outrageous daily/nightly rates of 250.00 per room. We were up all night and can not imagine how this place can stay in business other then there is a limited supply of hotel in the city of Rabat. A clean city that is‚Ä¶,sofitel _rabat,rabat

Ijlal in the spa gives a superb massage. Despite the hotel being older and elevators needing some serious maintenance attention, the hotel smells pleasant and the garden is immaculate. The ambiance is serene. The park nearby is a must. Thanks for another pleasant stay.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 February 2020,4,"Rooms need updating, Common Space very nice","Overall, it's one of the nicest large hotels for Rabat, however, weak compared to Sofitel in other major cities. The common space and gardens are beautiful, however, the rooms are worn and need major updating. The bar and restaurant were very good in terms of service and food quality. The pool is beautiful, however, not heated - so of little use in February. The gardens are spacious and relaxing. Could use a bit more variety and creativity. Common space is excellent. Housekeeping speaks French but good luck with English... explaining the desire for foam pillows requires a Google Image example. And of course - the shower has no door - allowing water all over the floor. It may look cool - but a terrible design idea.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

The Breakfast buffet was more efficient, and even had condiments on the table! Had problems with an overheated towel rail.

The room was too warm, even with the patio door open!",sofitel _rabat,rabat

In the corridors the dirt and fluff on the carpets are obvious under the LED spotlights. This made me think twice about the hygiene of the breakfast buffet.

Of course they didnt send me so I had to follow up on this. Called them, but they were not even understanding what I wanted so I sent an email. Then, no response. Next day, I called them again and asked the invoice. Now the most ridiculous part: The lady said she couldn't do it and asked me to call in the next day. However, I just said: why don't you take a note and talk to your colleagues. She didnt know what to do and then HUNG UP ON ME!!!!

Also very enjoyable was that Mustafa the cook would whip up fresh harissa for us. Soo delicious to put on the eggs & toast. We also enjoyed each and every meal at the Golden Fish Resturant.

Cleaning could have been a bit better, but the bed was very nice, clean and comfortable. Reception and other staff were very friendly and helpful. I would give them five stars. Service in the fish restaurant was a bit slow, but the food was quite good. Service on the terrace was also fine. I found the bar far too smoky for my tastes to be able to enjoy.

For mains, I would recommend the sea bass with risotto, as the sea bass was grilled to a tenderness and the risotto proved to be delightfully creamy. As for deserts, the ‚Äúrevisited‚Äù tiramisu also proved artistic yet delicious. Definitely worth a try! The service here was attentive and friendly.

Finally - do not eat in the hotel restaurants - neither the Moroccan or fish restaurants are up to 5 star standards.

 September 2018,3,Beautiful grounds but hotel and management have seen better days,"We stayed in a suite on the 5th floor, which was nicely designed but dated somewhere around 2005, which is when I am guessing this property was last refreshed. The suite itself was comfortable, with a nice fruit basket provided by management. The suite featured beautiful, large bathrooms with Hansgrohe fixtures and Herm√©s toiletries, but the bathrooms are also showing their age, with numerous cracks and repairs evident on the marble surfaces. The halls are dark and humid as the hotel has elected to turn off the AC in these areas. You can also see where painting and drywall repair have been done and not repaired in a professional manner.

The facilities are more than adequate, with spa and pool amenities top notch. The gym needs to be revisited. There are outdated equipment and much room for improvement. However, Nourdine the fitness instructor is very knowledgeable. I recommend that management ask him for redesign ideas. There are no basic weight apparatuses like bench press or curls.

I‚Äôve kept asking for the umbrella during 3 hours and I saw them giving umbrellas to new clients but never thought about the kids under the sun for long hours. The staff was not dealing with the issue seriously and they even kept laughing between them when I started becoming nervous about their lack of professionalism. I‚Äôve requested to see the responsible to be reimbursed but he didn‚Äôt come. So, I left and I‚Äôll never come back there.

Second, our room was purportedly ""nice"" but has a giant stain on the floor in carpet and a dirty napkin on the chair. There is chipped paint everywhere. NO CULTURAL TOUCHES. This is merely a Holiday Inn on Steroids. Do not be fooled by photos as they do not highlight the overlooked moldings and cracked tile.

My only two comments to explain the very good rating, rather than excellent, were its location and our bathroom. As tourists the hotel was not centrally located so unless you ate at the hotel you would need a taxi to take you to other restaurants. It was about 10-12 mins to the Medina in light traffic at night but it was slower during business hours. Our bathroom was lovely except it only had a bath with a hand held nozzle for the shower. There was no where to hang the nozzle so it had to be held all the time if using it. The bath was also quite deep so might present a challenge to someone a bit older.

 January 2018,5,Best hotel in town?,"Been to Rabat a few times and this could be the best hotel in town. It may not have the charm of some smaller places in town like the 'Tour Hassan Hotel' but it has many great things to like. Updated rooms, which are spacious, large modern and clean bathroom, overall very good service from staff and a calm/quiet neighborhood.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 December 2017,4,"Nice stay, beautiful hotel","We stayed for one night only at the Sofitel Rabat last December. The hotel is beautiful and modern with nice (but not very spacious) rooms. Like other Sofitel I've stayed, the bathroom is open in the room which is OK if you are alone but not so good if you are sharing the room. The location is also not the best one as it is a bit far from the city centre and its attractions, even though Rabat is not a touristic city. The Hotel gardens and pool area are gorgeus! The restaurant serves amazing food but service despite polite and nice is slow.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 January 2018,5,Excellent as Always,"We had another excellent experience, from arrival to departure. Houda, at the front desk, is always there to welcome us with a smile, which starts our stay on a very positive note. The lounge staff is also fantastic - au petit soin!",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 January 2018,5,Very Nice Hotel and Staff,"Spa is top notch, hotel in general is very nice with relaxing atmosphere, and pleasant perfume smell. The garden is lovely and staff are very courteous. The staff at Club Millesime on the 8th floor are very attentive, professional and friendly (Nice Job!). Some improvements needed are the fitness equipment maintenance (1 machine broken over 3 week‚Äôs), fitness towel availability, and one of the biggest issues is the hotel room doors often slam shut very loud (waking me up) with no rubber or padded material to dampen the sound. This is an easier fix opposed to all the toilet seats having slam resistant mechanisms (another nice option). Overall, the best hotel you can stay in Rabat and one of best Sofitels you can stay.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 January 2018,5,Relaxing stay,"Rabat is generally not a touristic city, so you must choose the right hotel for your stay. Sofitel with it's helpful staff is just the right decision.

 November 2017,3,Disappointed,"Was there for a business trip of 3 days and was staying in a junior suite. The room itself felt quite old, and was clean, but could have been better. I liked the set-up and the balcony. The service was strange - it is very surprising when you have a maid entering your room without waiting for permission ! (that actually happened a few times...) Besides, as the hotel was privatised for many event in parallel, you could really feel they were under staffed - be it for the breakfast, or lunch (where the only restaurant opened was at the pool). The gym is ok, and the sauna too. Bottom line, I may try it again but not soon.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

I have also stayed at various Sofitel establishments around this world and this one, is by far, the biggest let down. let me start with the strange housekeeping incidents. Three times in two days, housekeeping just opened up my door to come in the room. Let me explain why this was strange. Twice it was the same housekeeper so she knew the room was occupied and once, one did it at 9:00 AT NIGHT. they follow the same pattern; a brief knock and then the door immediately opens a couple of inches followed by whispered ""hello? hello?"".

The security by the entrance also made me feel safer, Breakfast as the Moroccan-style restaurant was excellent; fish dinner at the restaurant in the courtyard was good, though not great.

You won't go wrong booking your stay at the Jardin des Roses",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 July 2017,4,Luxury hotel and the only best in Rabat,"Rabat would probably have 2 5 star hotels, which this hotel is one and the best of both having compared both hotel. One point less than perfect was owing to the mistake in over charging me, but the staff at reception instead of being helpful, was extremely rude about. A manager intercepted and diffused the situation. Great and polite staff overall despite this one excluded incident.

 October 2017,5,Very nice hotel,"Spent 3 nights there and had a very good stay. I had dinner twice in the Gold Fish restaurant, and it was excellent: food, wine, service, ambiance - alike. SPA area is also very nice. Even if you are not a sauna fan, at least enter for a few minutes in the hamam, I'm not an expert but it looks very traditional. Bed and pillows are very comfortable. A great sunrise can be seen from the rooms on the garden / swimming pool side. Last but not least: great garden!! Just a couple of (minor in my view) points: 1. consider including an electric socket in the closet where the Nespresso machine is (otherwise, you need to take the machine out and place it on the table if you want a coffee in the room). 2. consider checking the lights from time to time and replace what is broken (one of the‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 September 2017,3,Club room: not worth the money,It is a nice hotel but service in the lounge is really bad for a Sofitel. Staff is hiding all the time and quality of the wine is terrible. We have stayed in many Sofitel club rooms around the World and this one is really the worse one. The pool is nice but it was not very clean. We found a dirty baby nappie on the floor next to the sun bed. Accor should be ashame to provide such a bad quality of service in Morocco. Service in general is very slow. Restaurants provide good food but they should serve orders quicker.,sofitel _rabat,rabat

 September 2017,4,Pleasant Stay,"This is a nice hotel in a nice quiet part of Rabat, in the middle of gardens and parks. Well decorated in typical Sofitel style. I would have liked a Moroccan touch. The rooms are trendy but the bed is not comfortable. Also this habit of having a glass separation between the bathroom and the bedroom is ridiculous. One cannot go to the bathroom at night without having the light disturbing his partner. Check-in was a bit slow but OK.

We have stayed at Sofitel in Rabat every year for 5 years now and sadly every year I always feel really upset with the service from the lobby staff. Maybe it is miscommunication but I get the feeling that they rarely want to do any extra, just what they have to do and nothing more. We often get a little bit of an attitude like they are better then others and also something very frustrating is that they give us different informations.

 April 2017,3,"Beautiful gardens and pool area, comfortable room, terrible food service","Big, busy hotel. PROS: The gardens and pool area are stunning The room and beds are comfortable CONS: The service is mediocre. Concierge was never there. The food service was terrible. There was a large crowd at breakfast each morning (which they could have expected from the number of reservations) and they ran out of things and didn't replenish them. Tables weren't set. Not what you would expect at a hotel like Sofitel. Food a the Moroccan restaurant in the hotel was terrible -- tasteless or bitter tasting salads, dry and tasteless chicken tagine, tough lamb tagine.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

When you first enter the restaurant, the thing you notice is the dim light and background arabic music. It creases for a nice convivial atmosphere. The choice of the menu is quite good with multiple variations of tagine and a few other things. I had the Lamb tangia which was a very generous serving of slow cooked lamb. The staff were all very attentive and very friend. Saana in particular was very helpful and friendly.

During my first trip to Morocco 3 years ago I went to another high-end hotel closer to downtown. All was fine during my stay and I was ready to return. But for some reason the hotel was full when I booked the second time therefore I switched to the Sofitel. It was actually the best thing that could happen to me! The Sofitel is gorgeous and the gardens are really (really!) impressive. The pool side is a great place to lounge after work whether you're still working or just relaxing. The rooms are comfortable.

It was an oasis of calm with lovely gardens. Fairly standard style for a big chain hotel, you could be anywhere in the world which is hot and sunny. The drinks bar service was excellent, they even brought out a laptop stand to help posture whilst working. The coffee was good and the beer cold! The pool was lovely, clean and quiet. The service by the poor was extremely slow, we asked for drinks 4 times, each time we were told a waiter would come out, they didn't and we went to the first bar to order in the end.

We booked in, were served a cold tea (which they then replaced), taken to our suite for a tour and were ready to chill onsite. The room while new and very nice had a few issues.

It felt like i was just dipped in oil by what seemed to be a non professional masseuse!! As i was leaving my massage room i discovered that the towel on top of my massage table was filled with brownish disgusting spots!!!! It was honestly nauseating!!!

They have great restaurants. One with local food and the other with more Americanized foods. They recently added a club on the grounds but don't worry the music is not loud enough to bother the hotel guest. They have live music most nights and sever dinner there, too.

She remembered dietary issues and brought snacks and food that suited those. We were moved to another room for on-going conference days and staff made sure we had the amenities we needed.

The problem with the Hotel is it is a little old and shows in areas especially in the rooms and corridors. The Moroccan Restaurant is excellent and food & beverage do the place justice and the breakfast buffet at Le Patio is also very nice and the team do a great job.

Excellent WiFi, although it seems Skype calls are blocked. Pool closes at 6 pm, which is very early. Minibar items are excessively priced.

 May 2016,3,Uneven service at the Sofitel,"I am a regular at the Sofitel as there are few options in Rabat for an hotel of this category. At first, the hotel seems to be worth its category: the lobby and the gardens are large and beautiful; the hotel offers different kind of restaurants; although the corridors in the hotel may need to be refreshed, rooms look quite comfortable and up to par of hotels in the same category; the problems in this hotel come essentially from a very uneven service: malfunctioning shower never repaired, towels or toiletries not systematically replaced, conflicting information from the staff, TV remote with low batteries ...

As such, it is priced monopolistically, and will remain as such till competition appears in the same category.

I do not recommend the spa at all. For a third of the price, you can get similar services in other places in Rabat. The massage wasn't very good and the entire experience wasn't relaxing because the staff just wasn't trained well to work in a five stars hotel. I still recommend staying there for the view and the location. The rooms are comfortable .",sofitel _rabat,rabat

I then telephoned and learn she is no longer with Sofitel. no one is willing to help me with this booking. I then get in touch with Taha, he finally helped me with this booking. I like rabat very much and decided to visit rabat again, so I emailed Taha. My God, he only emailed once, then disappeared again.

It was a sad choice and far from wise-undoubtedly the hotel has seen better days and better service; but those days are long gone. Setting aside the fact that most staff spoke little to no English, the rooms were tired, mattresses were saggy and their deep indentations were covered up by mattress pads (which were also old), the telephone apparatuses in the rooms did not work, room service after hours had to be ordered through the reception and took a long time to arrive, and there was not enough soundproofing for both outside and between-room noises.

When I raised this with the reception nothing was done about it till 2 days into our stay. - Coffee machine in the room wasn't working, which isn't a big deal but the staff had no idea how to fix it or run it. - Dining at the Moroccan restaurant within the hotel was just a waste of time & money.

 March 2016,4,Great hotel and location let down by staff,Stayed here in march for 5 nights for a conference. The hotel is set in beautiful gardens and the rooms are well appointed. Unfortunately that is the good. Firstly if you want a shower you need to specifically ask as a large amount of the rooms just have bathtubs with a shower attachment. I could not change my room on the first night and then spent five hours the next day trying to get my room changed. Which leads on to the reception staff - there is generally a lack of staff assisting people. Often there was only one person there and occasionally 2. This meant you were constantly standing in line waiting. In trying to change my room i spoke to 4 different people none of which knew of any request and therefore the whole process had to start again. After 5 hours i‚Ä¶,sofitel _rabat,rabat

As far as the location is concerned it is rather remote but taxis are cheap. Food is reasonably priced & room service is excellent. Wanting a light meal & feeling tired we ordered a soup to be brought to the room.

They have obviously learned about being polite and agreeable but it goes no further than that. On one occasion, for breakfast, I asked 3 times over a 45 minute period for a pot of boiling water, eventually a luke warm pot arrived without a cup to pour into. The beds are incredibly comfy, that is about the best thing going for it. The breakfast is also good, except for the service. I would not recommend eating there in the evening, the buffet is overpriced and sub standard. The bar is also over priced and full of sleepy business men and prostitutes, not a great atmosphere unless your looking for drugs (which are offered frequently) I was booked in for 10 nights, which was paid for by work - however if I had paid for this stay‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

Next to a great public park which gets busy in the weekends. It¬¥s not a beach property. I would say is more for business. Lobby: Very nice Lobby with plenty of nice places to sit and chat or even have meetings. Garden Pool Area: Pool is not heated but during summer might be a good option to spend some time.

There is a flexible showerhead that pulls from next to where the tub faucets are located but it always cut off after a pulled it away a certain distance.

That said, problematic for Business travelers needing a reliable connection to their headquarters (say in the USA) as the Internet crawls to a standstill in the evening (I am basing this assessment on a 2 week stay for business purposes; internet wasn't usable for at least 4 nights during my stay). Would like to end with a special mention/sincere thanks to the manager of the El Patio restaurant (Mr. Hamdani Yassine) and his team. His team went out their way to accommodate our special needs and make us feel very much at home. And, yes, the food was excellent. Thank you for your kind hospitality!",sofitel _rabat,rabat

I spent a very uncomfortable night there. I had to open the patio door in the middle of the night to get some fresh air. We did not call the front desk for two reasons; there were no signs on the phone for contacts neither were there a telephone directory in the room. Also, we were very tired and it was late at night.

The service we received everywhere in the hotel, from the Club to the restaurants and bar, was very good and the staff was very welcoming and attentive.

There's a gallery of high-end shops in the lobby and the clientele is ostentatiously moneyed and trendy. There are artificial rose scent dispensers everywhere, which seems nice at first but gets overwhelming in enclosed spaces like hallways. The bar is tragically hip and nightclubby, with really uncomfortable seating and slow service, but the drink selection and the snacks are nice.

The smaller one filled with salt water. The website of the hotel says one is heated but I was told the heating season has not yet started. A nice spa offering variety of treatments including a very gentle version of Moroccan Hammam. As this is luxury hotel, it is nice but also expensive.

I did not expect the hotel to find them but was very very disappointed by the lack of professionalism and communication in dealing with my complaint. I left a written notice for the general manager, I had to tell my story numerous times to the reception desk and I had to call several times the security officers to get updates.

So the initial outward grandeur of this hotel/resort was a bit overwhelming to me. After three days, it still is, although I have begun to see the cracks in the armour so to speak. As a plus, and this is the hotel's greatest strength, are the people--from the front desk/check in staff to the two concierges we dealt with on different occasions, to the staff in all three of the restaurants.

They have now added a lap pool, which allows you to put in a proper swim without having to swim around toddlers.

I don't usually take the time to review hotels but I just wanted to say how impressed I've been with the professionalism and attentiveness of the staff. Worthy of special mention are Leila in the reservations department and especially Hasnaa in Guest Relations. I had a weak wi-fi signal in my room and was unable to work. She couldn't have been more professional and attentive in resolving the issue and I was even given a gift to compensate for the inconvenience. Really excellent service.

The rooms in this hotel are small; you cannot walk around without hitting a piece of furniture. Room service quality was below average.

The floor manager Nezha checked on me in person asking if everything was ok and the maid, Aicha, came twice a day to clean and tidy up, which needless to say is more than enough.

The hotel itself is lovely too. Well worth booking a stay and using it as a base for exploring Rabat. Can't rate it highly enough. I came most recently for a birthday lunch on Sunday and we were especially well treated by our hostess 'Doha' who made sure we were happy at all times. Continue to be very impressed.,sofitel _rabat,rabat
 May 2015,5,Luxurious way to start my vacation.,"I arrived in Rabat for the start of my vacation. The grounds of the Sofitel are beautiful. The hotel is positioned next to a major park, so a wonderful walk through trees and paths was a great way to acclimate to the time change and jet lag. I was so surprised to find my room was a suite. I didn't know where to sit or sleep first. had dinner and breakfast at the hotel and both meals were plentiful and tasty!",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 June 2015,5,Very nice and accommodating hotel,"Very good service and a nice relaxing hotel. Very customer oriented and provided top notch service.

The breakfast buffet is a tad pricey, but there re many other options available. Looking forward to next stay.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 June 2015,3,"looks nice, and very friendly staff, but...","...for me, the place was a bit of disappointment for important perhaps personal reasons: the nice bathroom with a nice bathtub DIDN'T HAVE A SHOWER HOOK to take a shower... so quick showers were out, and it meant very uncomfortable and time consuming hair washing... Another reason - we ate so much at the Il Patio restaurant, and never were the dishes clean! Clean enough for me, anyway... Always they had some finger prints, oil marks, etc., even if it's not clearly food residue stuck there, I'm just not accustomed to eating off of plates that don't shine.. they don't have to be scratchless or anything, just clean... strange... I gave up after 3 or 4 plate tries and dealt with the stomach rumbles. And, last night before checkout - i saw a little roach that freaked me out... It‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 June 2015,2,"Nice property and potential, but terrible service","I was staying in this hotel in between the business trips & my husband joined me for the weekend. We knew that Sofitel is a great hotel chain with very nice hotels, so the choice in Rabat was easy. Ok, so some things were good as in other Sofitel hotels: great decor, beautiful garden, comfortable rooms, nice spa facilities, good massage. But all of this does not necessary make a hotel a 5 star one. SERVICE: The service of this one is very poor, although there are a lot of managers managing staff and even more managers managing the managers;) worst service was at the pool area: had to wait for towels for at least 30 mins at the weekend, for food & drinks-nearly 40mins. One day we waited for our mojitos for more than 40 mins, reminding the waiter 2 times and then left the pool‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 June 2015,4,Narrowly tailored but positive review,"This review is specifically for the staff of the Amber Bar at the Sofitel in Rabat. I have been traveling to Rabat for over two years now and the staff at the Amber Bar are always warm, welcoming and service oriented. No other team in the hotel is working to the same high service level as in the Amber Bar, especially Mssrs. LOURAUOI and NOUREDINE. Ask for them.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 September 2014,5,Beautiful Oasis,"After a very rough & very long trip into Morocco, arriving to the Sofitel was like arriving to a bubble of cleanliness, comfort, and luxury. The grounds are spectacular ~ the gardens, live music by the pool, pool ambiance & service. The rooms are lovely & the bathrooms gorgeous, with very nice amenities. Room service was delicious & the bed provided a great quality of sleep. Our only dissatisfaction was the lack of movies in the room ~ no option to order or rent any films at all, and given the limited television options, this provided for disappointing entertainment. This was our first stay at a Sofitel and our experience was so pleasant that we will in the future consider Sofitel among our hotel choices.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 May 2015,5,5 stars well earned,"We were on an extended tour of Morocco and wanted to end our trip getting...""Westernized"". We chose the Sofitel because it was next door to the outdoor site of the Mawazine Concert. (we enjoyed Jennifer Lopez and Pharrell from the balcony of our hotel room). The hotel has all the amenities that you would want...spa, pool, workout facility, several restaurants and a great staff. We used the pool, strolled in their rose garden and ate at several of the restaurants. The breakfast buffet is outstanding but every expensive at $25/person. We had dinner at their poolside seafood restaurant and it was excellent and reasonably priced.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 May 2015,4,"Lovely garden, many pleasant features","This is a big hotel with a well kept garden and many elegant features. An extra advantage for a business traveller spending too much time sitting in meetings is that the ample park next to the hotel has a 1.2 mile route suitable for running. The hotel has a pool too. The hotel is very clean, and the room was well appointed, with a biggish desk, sofa and chair, balcony, etc. The staff are very polite--I don't think I have ever had so many people say ""bonjour"" and ""bonsoir"" to me each day anywhere else! The things that weren't quite perfect were the wifi, which is unpredictable and only worked reliably in the lobby, and the slow service in the lobby cafe--this was a place to linger, not a place to grab a quick bite when a business appointment is coming up soon.

First of all, we got upgraded to oen of the most amazing suites I have stayed at! The personnel and guest relations were absolutely amazing. The products provided in the bathroom were top notch. The entire experience seamless from concierge support to housekeeping (who gave my two kids chocolates and pretty much made their stay!)",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 December 2014,5,Amazing Rose Scented Hotel,"I would highly recommend this hotel. The whole hotel just smelled of roses!! It was heavenly!! This was the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in overseas. I took pictures because it was so beautiful! Everyone was very nice, the food was good, they even had a little shop where I bought a silver tea pot to take home to the states. They have an ATM on site and a nice hotel bar. The grounds are wonderful. I highly suggest you take the time to walk around. I don't think I will ever be able to stay somewhere else in Rabat. I am officially spoiled.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 October 2014,5,"Beautiful Hotel, Rescued My Luggage!","The Sofitel Rabat Jardin des Roses is an amazing hotel. The grounds are beautiful and the breakfast buffet is remarkable. In fact, after staying at the Sofitel in Rabat, I was really let down by the breakfast at the Sofitel in Casablanca. The night that we arrived we ate at the hotel restaurant and I highly recommend trying the pigeon pie. My luggage was lost in transit to Rabat and the hotel staff went above and beyond their duties by sending someone to the airport to pick up my luggage for me, allowing me not to miss an important meeting. The only drawback to this hotel is its location. It is very far from anything. I did walk from the hotel to the Chellah, but I would not recommend doing that for most people as it is quite some distance away. The hotel only has grand taxis,‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 April 2015,2,Very disappointed,"The outer physical property was pleasing and parking easily accessible. we were confronted by a overwhelming perfumy smell as the automatic doors opened. The front desk staff treated me rudely. The elevator and hallway to my room also had a odor of headache producing smell of strong perfume. When we opened the door to our room it smelled of smoke. I called to the front desk to request another room. I waited and waited and another person came on the line and again I was treated rudely.and was again treated rudely. I opened the balcony door which alleviated the smell. The porter was lovely and tried to help us get the front desk. After ten minutes we decided to let it go as the opened windows were helping .

 April 2015,5,Great Stay at the Sofitel,"I stayed at the Sofitel for about a month while working in Rabat. The hotel was excellent, most notably its well maintained building and grounds. The hotel and area was also very quiet, so I slept very well throughout my stay. My only complaint was how far the hotel was from the city center and the requirement to drive most places around the city. Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful. I'll take a moment to highlight Mounir, a very friendly and helpful attendant that helped me with my many suitcases and luggage pieces (I'm living in Morocco for a few months) the morning I checked-out from the hotel. His english was very good and he went out of his way to ensure I had the easiest possible check-out process. I will look forward to staying at the Sofitel Rabat again soon.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

Her smile, passion for customer service were well received and I am grateful to have met her when I first arrived.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 April 2015,1,Awful,"Miserable experience from start to finish. The staff are incredibly rude. The hotel reeks of cheap perfume - not of guests, but some spray meant to cover up a poorly cleaned hotel. The woman at reception laughed at my question about wifi. Our room smelled of cigarette smoke, despite being nonsmoking. The kind gentleman who brought up our bags instructed me how to call reception from our room. When I did, a woman answered and said she was guest relations and would transfer me to reception for ""more information."" I said I didn't need more information, but rather a smoke-free room. She laughed and told me to hold for reception. I did. The phone rang 30 times. No one answered. With so many lovely hotels to choose from at lower rates, I strongly advise any traveller to avoid this‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 April 2015,5,You're treated special at Jardin des Roses,"It's so nice and comforting at the Jardin des Roses. It is by far the best hotel in Rabat because of its service and ground. The staff were very responsive and warm. They made me feel at home and ensure that I was well taken care of. In particular, I had gotten sick during the later part of my trip and the hotel concierge contacted an in house doctor promptly to visit me in my room. And the staff, Houda, called to ask how I was and see if there's anything they can do to make me more comfortable. These gestures made me feel taken care of and that I'm not just another guess. This is why I stay at this hotel whenever I'm in Rabat.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

The hotel seems completely sound proofed - I did not hear any other guest coming or going, no doors slamming etc as in other hotels! Very peaceful.

My luggage was lost by my airline and due to the law of morocco, the airline cannot deliver the luggage to the hotel. I flew into casablanca which is about 1.2 hour away from Rabat, which meant I thought I had to go back to the airport the next day to get my luggage, a completely dreadful situation. I was in Rabat for a conference and could not leave for 4 hours to get my luggage, it would make me miss half of the conference..

 February 2015,5,Excellent Hotel in Rabat,"We stayed here during a business trip and really enjoyed it. The hotel is a little outside of downtown, on a hilltop (it used to be a Hilton). You can walk to the main part of town within an hour or easily grab a cab. Its also a 10-minute walk from the new tram which was easy to use and get around. The grounds of the hotel were great with a nice pool, balconies for most of the rooms, and great staff and service. The breakfast option was worth it and a great start to each day. Additionally, the food options in the hotel were good and the bar was adequate (but smokey inside in the evenings). As I said, the location is not ideal, but the hotel was excellent and made up for it. Its still easy to explore the area and an easy ($20 USD) cab to the airport.

Of the many countries I have stayed from Taipei, Philippines, Malaysia, Turkey, Colombia, France to Thailand, Australia and Singapore this hotel is the best. The reason I say this is that it is easy for a five star hotel to have nice physical surroundings and they all have the same amenities but the service I have received at this hotel is better than any.

We talked to the lady at the reception again and she actually tch at us and put her phone down loudly. We found this ridiculous since the check-in time was at 3pm and it was not our fault at all.

The manager nicely upgraded us to a higher floor. Unfortunately in our 2nd room, the shower was not working and it took 5 phone calls and a night to get it fixed. The room smelled terrible : obviously people have smoked there recently. Most of the rooms and the corridors are in need of renovation: the paint on the walls are chipped, there is mold everywhere... The international buffet dinner was average. the problem is the location of the hotel is far away from everything so you can't just walk to a restaurant...

 November 2014,5,Beautiful business hotel,The hotel is stunningly beautiful with excellent service. The breakfast exceptional. The location is not very central so you will need to take a taxi pretty much anywhere. The hotel has a lovely (unheated) outdoor swimming pool but no indoor pool. The use of the spa facilities is not included in the room price.,sofitel _rabat,rabat
 April 2014,5,Superb garden,"I stayed at this hotel many times, first time in 1975 with my parents (name was Hilton), and the last time in April 2014. I was impressed by the beautiful garden. I remember that in 2010, the garden hosted an exhibition of sculpture in bronze. Bronze association with the explosion of garden colors was magnificent. Some tips that I want to share with you to have a pleasant stay. I recommend rooms on the higher floors, 5,6,or 7 or 8. Also, breakfast is better to be served at the ground floor restaurant, El Patio, even if you have access to the Club Mill√©sime. Some rooms are a bit outdated. They need a refresh. The staff is courteously, especially those from restaurants and bars. I will return to this hotel with pleasure.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 December 2014,3,Not up to Sofitel standards,"As a travel professional I rate hotels based on their advertised quality. The Sofitel is a deluxe category hotel, but falls short in a number of ways. First the good part. The lobby is really top notch. Both comfortable and inviting. The Moroccan restaurant feel and food exceeded our expectations. Very friendly and kind staff and we enjoyed the live music. The spa was nice and was as you would expect from a hotel. They missed their mark in many other items. A top hotel is suppose to take care of the little things as well as the big things. I was traveling with my wife and two kids (ages 11 & 14) who had their own room. At the time of reservation I request adjoining rooms and even prepaid for the rooms. When I arrived around six pm they did not even have rooms for us on the‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

The room is large, comfortable and practical, with view on the garden which I prefer, and is very relaxing. We appreciated the work of the housekeeping, very polite, helpful and very thoughtful! They don't hesitate to help us in our needs (with a baby on board!), so special thanks to Habiba, Fatma Zohra and Hind. Food is great and tasty.

I also reached out to the concierge, Adil, prior to arrival to help make transportation arrangements for our week of touring from Rabat to Chefchaouen, Fez, back to Rabat, and finally Casablanca for our flight home.

 October 2014,5,very nice hotel overall,I stayed at this hotel several weeks ago. The hotel is really good.

The setting was lovely, the grounds magnificent, but the service was dreadful, They took no imprint of my credit card and when I tried to pay for dinner there seemed to be no ability to do this at the restaurant and I was frog marched to the front desk like a naughty child. The service in the restaurant was absolutely appalling, We finished our main course and ended up leaving, having sat with our empty plates for over half an hour, with no-one approaching us to ask about dessert or coffee. The shower over the bath was inaccessible for anyone except the most agile. I would never stay here again.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 November 2014,4,Luxury: But don't count on internet (or parking),"As a luxury hotel, or a spot to entertain business prospects Sofitel earns its five stars. Any business that needs to get done online; however, is incredibly frustrating. Don't expect to get any work done that involves being online; internet speeds are atrocious, forget about downloading anything, even sending emails is a test of patience at times. From the 2nd floor I showed full bars on my internet and on average, I received 1.18mps, the low end being .24, the high end a 3.19. (I sampled 9 days over a three week period using Speedtest.net by Oookla and have the links to these tests if anyone is interested) I've also stayed on the 6th floor with the same result - horrible speeds. The ease of parking depends on the events also taking place here; spaces can be hard to find‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 October 2014,1,Overpriced and overrated,"I was very hesitant about staying at this hotel because of pass experiences. I should have follow my instincts because my stay was absolutely horrible. First of all upon check-in, my female receptionist put a temporary hold of $6750 for a $3900 stay. The customer or service does not exist, when you call the reception the phone just ring and ring and ring. When you call and order food or ask for anything, it will take more than 30 to 40 minutes to respond. The three female receptionist always have this "" Whatever"" kind of attitude and are always huddle up talking, laughing and totally ignoring the customers. The room rate, food and alcoholic beverage are all overpriced, breakfast will cost you 250 MAD and is not included in your room rate. My hotel reservation was made by the‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 November 2014,3,Customer Service needs attention,"I would say that this hotel could be so much better than what it is today especially when it comes to their customer service. The receptionist have this ""whatever"" kind of attitude and don't apologize for things that were mishandled. Unfortunately, many incidents occured which could have easily been managed by better trained employees. First of all, a message was not delivered to me which caused complications. Second, calling the front desk would require at least 2-3 attempts.....simply no answer and no apologies. Extending by one night caused even more issues...they simply didn't seem to be able to handle that. Again, very simple things but with inexperienced and very ""blah"" staff, these things seemed impossible. I would highly recommend training to all the staff on better‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 September 2014,4,"Very Nice, Very Expensive","There aren't many top notch hotel options in Rabat, but Sofitel Rabat Jardin des Roses is certainly the nicest. The pool area is lovely, the gardens are nicely kept and the rooms are well appointed. However, you pay a pretty penny for these luxuries and the location isn't exactly central to the city center. Bottom line, Rabat is a nice city but not a tourist hub. If you're in town for a night, you're probably better off staying closer to this city center. If you're there for several days for business or to see family, Sofitel is a fine choice.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

My room was very nice, with a really comfortable bed and roomy shower and a beautiful view of the pool and gardens. Because of work, I ate all of my meals here and tried several of the restaurants. They were always happy to accommodate any request I had and even fixed me a special meal that was not offered on the menu that evening when I asked about it. The pool was nice and clean. The staff was very friendly. The concierge arranged a tour for me so that I was able to briefly get out and see some of the city. I definitely recommend a stay here when if you travel to Rabat.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

The staff at the breakfast restaurant are top notch: attentive and efficient without being obsequious. Namely, Nadia Fakhdy, Fatima Al Zahra, and Zahra (from the egg/omelet station) are exceptional and work to ensure an enjoyable breakfast experience. The Amber Bar staff are similarly solid. My main complaint is the shower contraption in the bathroom. The wall mount for the hand wand was broken, and the work-around solution is ridiculous and not functional.

The rooms are very modern and clean and the restaurants are good. Admittedly the common areas could use a bit of a face lift, but there is certainly nothing to be bothered by. There are also several nice shops located inside the lobby area. The staff are generally very friendly and helpful although follow-through is sometimes an issue. The real plus of this hotel is the grounds. They are absolutely beautiful, from the lovely pool to the gardens. The outdoor dining is special.

We found the room in an excellent status of cleaning, nicely decorated and really comfortably furnished. Later on, also the staff around the pool and the bar beside made us to say: we don't need and we don't want to go out of here!.

Unlike most of the global Sofitel brand you actually feel like you are in North Africa. The rooms are modern, on the small side but very well appointed with a bathroom I would be proud of at home. The bed was a bit soggy for my liking and there is no desk as such for sad people like me who work in such sumptuous environments but everything else was perfect. The food is likewise as good, if not better, than you would expect in any of the best European hotels. All in all worthy of 5 stars, well not quite.

When I told them I was switching rooms, they looked at me blankly. I went to the reception, and the woman there was quite rude as if reception were not responsible for assisting customers.

The decor is dramatic black, very contemporary. This hotel is used by functionaries from multiple countries, most arriving or departing in private limousines; this has an impact in the hotel's feel, which is not geared to tourists.

 June 2014,5,My favorite hotel in Rabat.,"This is my preferred hotel in Rabat, and I‚Äôve been staying here every time I go. Everybody knows this hotel since it was Hilton, so if you meeting someone and if they didn‚Äôt know the address or a driver is not sure which can happened sometimes, just say the old Hilton or Jardin Des Roses. I just love their garden and to sit there in the evening or early morning for coffee. The rooms are very good after the renovation, great Spa (Try the royal Hamam) and restaurants (Sea food by the pool). Friendly stuff and great location. The only thing you need to bare in mind is that 99% of official delegation tend to stay there, so if you are caught with the arrival of someone it gets quite crowded and can take sometimes for the cars to clear out but I guess the hotel can‚Äôt do much about‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

First, the pluses: the beds were great, the bathroom was nice (though my colleagues were uniformly dissatisfied with theirs); the pool and gym facilities were pretty good. The problems were: - The wifi was patchy and unreliable - The service, except at Reception, was fairly indifferent. For example, I asked Housekeeping for an iron and ironing board three times; the first time, they said they could not deliver one after hours; I rang back to see if I could have it in the morning, they said yes, and it never arrived. I had to ask a third time to get this simple request actioned. Similarly, I made an inquiry at the front door about taxis, and was airily waved off to a bunch of cars‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

This Sofitel generally served this purpose and was a very good decision. We were greeted by a very kind staff who served us tea and Moroccan cookies. We've stayed in several Sofitels around the world. The service at this one was bar none, the best. The concierge, Adil Tahri, was probably the most attentive concierge we've come in contact with anywhere in the world. Even though we stayed only one night, he planned our driver for the entire 12 day trip and stayed in contact with us by cell phone the entire time.

When we checked in she was given a gorgeous room on the garden with a great sunny balcony, deep tub, lovely bathroom, big bed, and lots of room to make herself at home. I got a room facing the street side of the hotel, with a dark, shady balcony, tiny room, no bathtub. We had two wildly different rooms. When I called the front desk to ask to move, they told me they didn't have any more garden rooms.

 February 2014,3,Good but could do better,"I stayed for 3 nights at the Sofitel while at a conference in Rabat. The room was very comfortable, and the chambermaid Hind was very good and ensured both that my room remained spotless and tidy, even putting socks that I had left on the floor into a plastic bag in the wardrobe. The breakfast was very well served on my first day, but the service on the second day was lamentable - very slow with waiters deliberately ignoring myself and other guests. I told the receptionist of my disappointment, and the next day (having decided to sit elsewhere in the restaurant), the service was again impeccable. On my way out, she thanked me for having told them of my concern and told me that all the staff had been given a talk on ensuring customer satisfaction. So it is worth complaining...!",sofitel _rabat,rabat

The hotel sits just outside the center yet very accessible using local inexpensive taxi service.

Rooms were not ready when we arrived but we were able to get breakfast in the restaurant while we waited. To accommodate our large group on future mornings, breakfast was set up for us in a large meeting room. There were lots of food items available. The yogurt with strawberries on the bottom served in a small glass jar was delicious. So was the fresh-squeezed orange juice. Our room was comfortable with a walk-out balcony and a great view of the inviting grounds. The concierge was helpful in arranging car service for shopping.

Its about a 15min walk to the nearest tram stop into town but there are plenty of taxis outside. We got a good deal on the room rate but be warned once inside everything is very expensive. For one evening meal & two breakfasts for a couple, our bill came to almost ¬£150!. But it is a luxury branded hotel. Staff were very helpful and friendly.

Gym is well outfitted with brand new, state of the art equipment and staffed with ""trainers"" to help you get the most out of your workout. Rooms are immaculate, phenomenal rain shower head (I never even used the normal shower head), plus a balcony out to the huge garden. Internet is slow, VPNs are not blocked, but the signal goes in and out enough that VPNs cannot maintain their connection, thus rendering them useless.

There was also no apology. So a cold shower for us....and then we received a letter saying the staff were going on strike and there would be no food or baggage handling in the morning.

Strange bath and shower combi, not the best. There are a choice of restaurants on the site - buffet and traditional. Tried both and preferred the former.

The rooms are nice at first sight but once I looked closer I saw that the paint in some areas was falling off the walls, coffee machine wasn't working, no kettle in the room, my hair dryer was missing. Internet is good in some rooms and in others you can barely connect. All rooms have nice and spacious balconies which gives you a beautiful view if you are lucky to face the garden. The breakfast is ok but the staff working in the breakfast restaurant are so unfriendly. I had to ask 3 times for my coffee before it came about 45 minutes later. Even the manager is not friendly.

When it was returned, there was a huge hole in the right side lapel. Management took four days to solve the issue and left everything for the very last minute. They initially promised they would find the best solution, which would be a new suit. At the end, they came up with the story that the suit was not new (though I had purchased one week before). Since there was no effort to solve the problem, I went to a local Hugo Boss store and purchased a similar suit for US$ 1,200.00. After some headache, they finally paid US$ 485.00, deducting from my hotel bill and giving me US$ 150.00 in cash. It is a great hotel, but when it comes to‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

 November 2013,5,Great hotel in Rabat,Housekeeping (Habeba) was great and provided a clean and made up room every day. Staff (Houda) at the reception desk was very friendly and helpful.

The fitness centre is large with lots of equipment and looks out on the grounds, the attendants very helpful and wiped down the equipment after each person used it and there was lots of water, which was needed since the air conditioning was a bit weak. Food in the Moroccan restaurant was a great introduction to Moroccan lamb tagines. My wife and I started to go for a walk but once off the grounds were immediately approached by sketchy looking men asking for money, did not feel that comfortable so returned to the hotel.

As indicated by an earlier reviewer, there is no overhead shower in some bedrooms, just a hand-held device, and the bath tub is too small with no grab bars. Food is high quality. The breakfast buffet on the ground floor beats out the 8th floor executive lounge in both food selection and ambience, especially if you can take a table on the verandah.

If I had the choice, I would have rather paid to have high speed Internet in my room. How could you call yourself a 5* hotel in Rabat and can't get the Internet to work in 2013.

Great for walking and running. You can also walk to the ocean, less than a mile away. The hotel is clean and smartly furnished, especially in the 7 & 8th club floors. The club lounge itself, on the 8th floor, is OK, with limited hours and limited offers. The views from balconies are great. The main shortcoming I found was in the lack of proper work space in the rooms, not even a proper chair to work from. Another is the length of time it took to check out, a nuisance of you are in a hurry.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

Corridor walls needed patch and paint. Had to ask for a coffee maker in my room. I was told first floor rooms didn't get them.

Answer the Phone: calling was a real chore as it took many, too many and some more rings before someone answer and when they did, the service provided was slow and mostly unfulfilled. For example: the minibar and coffee were not replenished until we called, and after enduring the long wait before answering the phone, we managed to get the coffee refilled 3 days out of 6.

The hotel has free wi fi. However it is not very strong, but at least it is there. Breakfast is not very exciting. First off all, flies are all over the fruit and cold cuts.

Houda and Ikram ladies from front desk are the best front desk staff i have ever seen, very kind and helpful. They provide me with everything I need with no trouble. Restaurant and Bar spots are also great with the view and full of dynamic atmoshphere. The huge garden behind the hotel is also very good place to enjoy your time in extreme peace.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 May 2013,4,Lovely Hotel,"All in all a lovely hotel, with generally only minor complaints (except for the taxi, detailed last below). First the bad, then the good. As with many things French, lovely design but often quite impractical. To be specific, the bathrooms. Both my colleague and I (separate rooms) laughed the first morning about how we got drenched in the shower. It's a complicated mechanism, and despite all the hotels I have stayed in it took some effort to figure out how to operate the two different sprays with the one control. Another issue was the sinks. Again, beautiful to look at but easily gets water everywhere over the vanity. The bar at night is ridiculously loud; impossible to sit there and have a conversation. The outside patio is nicer, but even that gets too much noise. I'm not 90,‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 May 2013,5,Beautiful hotel in Rabat,"There is not that much in Rabat for tourists, but this hotel is a beautiful place, with great service, food and amenities. The gym and spa are nice, and the pool area is gorgeous. We were there the same night as a Rihanna concert next door, and the walls did not keep out the sound but that is likely not usually the case. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rabat.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 May 2013,4,"Georgeous hotel, lovely people work there, beware the cost of eating","This was a glorious stay. The staff are so welcoming and helpful. The spacious room was beautiful with a balcony overlooking the garden and pool. I would return just for the pool, especially in the balmy May weather. I went in search of sunscreen at the hotel shops and was finally directed to the spa. They insisted I borrow a tube of good quality Clarins sunscreen rather than buy it, and even delivered it to me pool side. This is just one example of the friendly service. However, I found the restaurants seriously overcharged, especially for breakfast, and often the charges were not made clear. Food is so good and so inexpensive in Morocco, that this really stood out. Too bad to mar an otherwise wonderful impression.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 May 2013,4,Excellent hotel and service but expensive,"This is a modern hotel up to the typical Sofitel standards. The rooms are very nice. They each have a small balcony, but oddly, only a single chair. Even more odd for a business hotel, there is no desk chair. There is a sitting chair and a chaise, and you pull up either of those to a table, but the chaise is too low and the chair is too high to get the arms under the table. Furthermore, it is a sitting chair, with a reclining back, so you are too far away from the table to use a computer comfortably. My back got sore after less than 30 minutes of work on my computer, and I had to work several hours a day on the computer, so this was a nightmare. Given this is primarily a business hotel this is unacceptable and the main reason I did not give the hotel a five star rating. ‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 April 2013,5,Always a pleasure,"As a frequent client,I just want to confirm my appreciation for the service in this outstanding hotel. And I would like to insist on the quality of the desk service. Specially services delivered by Majda, Ikram, Sarah and Ahmed",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 May 2013,4,Fantastic as expected but pity about the smoke,"As you would expect from Sofitel, this hotel is top class in all aspects, from the great service to the execellent rooms. Location is good for visiting the UN offices and country embassies but I wouldn't recommend it if you prefer staying in the heart of the city as the Sofitel is on the outskirts of Rabat. My main dissapointment (and surprise) was to find that smoking is permitted throughout the hotel, including the restaurants and lobby area, I'm used to staying mainly in European hotels so this was a bit of a shock, especially for an international luxury brand like Sofitel. Having said that the air circulation in the hotel is very well managed so I could hardly smell the smoke. I would definitely stay here again, hopefully by that time they would have joined the rest of‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,4,"Long stay, same as my family","I stayed 60 days continuously in Sofitel Jardin de Roses in Rabat, it was really exciting experience, same as always and everywhere there are positives and negatives, but it's something different when a negative matters are reported and actions are taken to handle them. For example I've faced a very slow service at beginning, and sometimes it was at the top, to be very bad other times, I've reported that issue and something else the actions have been taken, it was really appreciated for everyone followed up. By the way I'd like to pass my regards and many thanks to those people who made feel that I'm among my family and being one of this very nice community.

 March 2013,5,Excellent Luxury Hotel,"I stayed many times at the Sofitel Jardin de Roses in Rabat, Moroco. The Hotel is very tastefully decorated in typical Moroccan style. The rooms are classy, the Restaurant serves excellent food, the bar is a great place to have a drink after a long day. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. One of the best features is the garden with the pool area, a great place to relax and enjoy the great Moroccan weather, drinks and food.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 April 2013,3,"ok hotel, cold draft in the lobby","Nice renovated room. One chair on the balcony....but it is a room for two..........so why only one chair? Electric curtains, but to reach the buttons you must climb on a sofa. The bathroom is open to the room. If the bedroom's temperature is fresh, so will be the temp of the bathroom. I did not not like this. Otherwise the bathroom is comfy, has a spacious shower cabin, soft towels and Occitane toiletries. Comfortable bed, 180x200. Flatscreen tv with international chanels. Wifi does not work in the room. Well, it works (a bit) when you stay close to the door but if you take one step into the room the signal is gone. The reception area is full of cold air. Sliding doors on opposite sites of the lobby (one side the street, the other side the garden) add some aircon and the result‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,5,Great hotel,"we stayed at the Jardin des Roses for only one night prior to leaving for the United States. We wish we could have stayed longer. The property is really beautiful. This is the only hotel we stayed in during our recent 10 night trip that did not have a moroccan or local theme. It is a new, very modern hotel, but it is spectacular. The service was great and the breakfast buffet was incredible. What I remember most was the incredible smell of roses in the lobby. The one thing to note that you must take a cab ride to the old city and the medina.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,5,Fantastic Experience,"We stayed here five nights this month doing business in Rabat and it really deserves to be a 5-Star property. The facility is immaculate and as you walk in the fragrance of roses and the entire lobby excites the imagination for what to expect at this hotel. The restaurants, spa, lovely grounds in back, proximity to historic sights, including the Royal Palace are some of the factors making this place a desirable place to do business or enjoy a vacation. We had a nice room with a good view and the bedding was such that we always had a nice sleep. The staff will attend to every need without being too intrusive. We like the buffet and normally we don't say this about buffets but this place could show Las Vegas how to do a real buffet of highest quality. The Moroccan restaurant‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,4,Exceeded expectations,"I stayed at this hotel for the last four nights of a 5 week 35,000 mile business trip and it was excellent. The bed and pillows were among the most comfortable that I have experienced in a hotel. The service was excellent, the food was good and the atmosphere was relaxed. The room was very well equipped. The wifi was good enough to download an iTunes movie overnight and for video Skype. My room overlooked the front entrance but it was very quiet. My coworker said the garden side was preferable.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,5,Accommodations were perfect,Staff was excellent! Houda and Imane at the front desk were helpful and professional. The gardens were beautiful and the rooms are clean and spacious. The spa had staff who assisted me with my workout routine. Treadmills were sturdy and the spa was clean. Thank you for the hospitality.,sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,4,Sofitel Rabat Jardin des Roses,"Great location, friendly reception, really comfortable beds, great facilities. Only areas of improvements - we booked an executive room - the ensuite only had a bath versus shower/bath - the executive lounge seemed a little uninviting - but room service was excellent.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,5,Quiet & Comfortable,"Room was spacious, quiet and comfortable. It was a very pleasant stay in a well located hotel. Very nice amenities although very little time to use them. The breakfast buffet offered good variety but service was a little off.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,5,A wonderful place,"After 2 different trips in Rabat during which I have stayed in Riads, this time I was ready for something more. The main reason for the switch was related to the needs of a business trip. Better internet access and a calm place, mostly. The presence of a good bar doesn't hurt either :^) So what about it? It's absolutely wonderful. It must be said the gardens in the back are amazing and when the weather is fair, it's a lovely walk. Eating and/or drinking outside is also a must. The rooms couldn't be cleaner and more comfortable. The bed allowed me to get the best sleep possible and the automatic Nespresso machine allowed me to wake up in the morning. The bathroom is perfect, with a very large and efficient shower. The service is top notch of course, as is expected of places‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 October 2012,4,Stop and Smell the Roses!,"We stayed in this hotel on our last night in Morocco as part of a tour group. There was a conference on at the time and I believe every hotel was booked and our group was upgraded to stay here. I have stayed in plenty of five star hotels before, however I have never stayed in one with such beautiful rose gardens and aromatherapy rose oil diffused into every hallway. Everything smelt like we were living in a fragrant garden. Our room had a good view of the guards, heavily armed, so at least we felt very secure. Bed was very comfortable - the best one of the tour. Good size bathroom, heated towel rail helped get washing dry. Everything else spoke of luxury - great toiletries and excellent selection. Gym was well equipped, plus a golf driving range and tennis courts. Room air‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2013,5,Restrained luxury,"I satyed at the Sofitel Jardin des Roses for three nights in March 2013 while in Rabat on business. Some luxury hotels feel like museums where one doesn't feel at home but that wasn't the case with this particular Sofitel. The brand of luxury served at this Sofitel though was very welcoming and balanced. The spacious lobby welcomes passangers and the service at the reception was extremely friendly and efficient both at the time of the check-in/out processes as well as at other times. The room (Luxury Room Club Sofitel class) on the 8th floor was great; spacious and well equipped with sweeping views over Rabat towards the ocean. The room was perfectly soundproofed, not a sound could be heard from the hallway or from outside. And the bed was exquisite! Floor 8 also houses the‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat

It is modern, well maintained, and for a business traveler, ideal for the quiet and comfort of the rooms. The staff is incredibly pleasant and helpful, and the restaraunts are very good. The pool and grounds are at or above the standards of any other world class hotel I have stayed at. The hotel manager was incredibly responsive and personally committed to making sure any concern I had was addressed -- his attitude sealed my loyalty to Sofitel for the future. This stay was perfect.

 March 2013,2,5 Star potential and facilities but very poorly run,We had high expectations because I am a frequent user of Sofitel and a Platinum Card holder (their loyalty programme) so were very disappointed with the series of issues that indicate severe service problems with this hotel that ranged from unhappy staff (I asked for for one of my notes to be broken down to tip the bell boy at the reception desk and was referred to the bank!) to inability to get simple things like a fresh milk and a jug for boiling water for tea to only one towel in the bathroom to no one picking up phones in reception to the lack of towels in the fitness centre and the fact that it was not open 30 minutes after opening hours to the lack understanding for even simple requests (the exception was the concierge which is the only department working properly) so‚Ä¶,sofitel _rabat,rabat

Lovely beds, very modern style, great bar and restaurant etc. but for me the real highlight were the great staff. Guest relations manager Ghizlane Halaoui spent over half an hour finding a solution to a problem we had finding rooms in Casablanca. She really went above and beyond. This seemed to be quite typical of the helpful friendly attitude of the hotel staff. The hotel was fully booked, and I'm not surprised. A great experience. I only didn't give it five out of five because my room didn't have a shower and the lock on the balcony door was broken.",sofitel _rabat,rabat

The rooms are consistently look fresh and comfortable. The quality of the hotel staff is second to none in terms of friendliness (considering how warm and friendly Moroccan are generally, this is saying a lot), efficiency and going the extra mile to make a guest's stay as pleasant as possible. Such quality is evident across the board - from the manager (Mr. Mbarki) to the front desk staff (Ms. Houda). Check-in and out is always a breeze.

The infrastructure is excellent, the pool stunning (potentially the nicest I've ever seen--although very cold!), and so on. But what really set it apart was the staff. Everyone was just as friendly and helpful as can be. I particularly appreciated Houda at the front desk, who not only resolved any question any guest put to her (and in any of three languages, natch), but put a smile on everyone's face by her cheerful greeting and easy demeanor. One smile or joke and the guest truly felt as if he (or she) were at home, not simply attending a conference.

The room itself was beautiful, well equiped with large safe, complimentary water, walk in rain shower and wifi.

It was a real delight: the modern decoration of the room, the lovely view of the gardens and the swimming pool, the hall and reception areas, the garden, the various eating areas, every corner of the hotel conveys a sense of luxury, good taste and comfort. The only minus I would say was the quality of breakfast. While the orange juice freshly squeezed was delicious, the coffee good quality, the rest was not really what I would have expected of the best hotel in town.

 August 2012,5,Splendidly Renovated and Managed,"I stayed at this hotel many times years ago when it was a Hilton. I feared, when booking, that it would be very tired. What a surprise I got: It has been splendidly and imaginatively redone as a Sofitel. It is amazing what the skillful architects and designers have created from a 1970's Hilton. The rooms and bathrooms have a spacious feeling, with sliding glass panels. The garden is now very mature and beautifully maintained. Service was most attentive. We stayed in seven hotels during this visit to Morocco and this was our favorite. Congratulations Sofitel.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 August 2012,4,Very good but a bit impersonal and overpriced,"After having stayed in much smaller riads and hotels I must admit the western comfort of the Sofitel felt good. The rooms are nice. Beds the best ever. Good rainshower and a nice balcony overlooking the gorgeous garden. What's less favorable? - prices: while the rooms are fairly cheap - we paid 155 euro's and got a free extra bed for our kids and were upgraded to luxury - everything else is expensive. A bottle of water is seven euros, a simple club sandwhich 20 euros etcetera. - the service is good but it is what it is: a big business hotel and thus the whole experience is a bit cold and stiff - location: it's a few miles outside the centre.

But the hotel has some of the most comfortable beds I have seen. The rooms are spacious, and so are almost the entire area within the Hotel. It seems the hotel was constructed to have as much space as possible-from the lobby to the swimming pool to the lush mini golf course and garden.

 December 2010,4,Beautiful and well-appointed hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel, with a spacious lobby area, two restaurants (although they are both not open every night and don't stay open all day), separate bars with and without alcohol, a well-equipped exercise facility, complete spa, and absolutely beautiful gardens and pool area. The room was large, the towels and linens were luxurious, had both a chair and chaise-lounge for seating, and the balcony was large enough for a chair, ottoman, and small table. Our room's bathroom had a large and deep tub (but only a hand-held shower) and a separate toilet room. However the bathroom didn't have a real door (more of a sliding screen), and the door to the toilet room was just frosted glass and not lockable. The breakfast (included with our room price) was very good--lots of‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 October 2010,4,Review of Sofitel Rabat,In general overall service was good. There was a mistakenly added item on my bill but that was quickly resolved by the front desk staff after they checked their records.,sofitel _rabat,rabat
 October 2010,5,A real gem,"I have just spent one week in Morocco and the Jardin des Roses was by far the best bet. Excellent value for money, excellent location, recently renovated, the staff was really helpfull and wellcoming. An oasis. I would definetely recommend it as one of the best hotels in Morocco.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 September 2010,4,"Great hotel, a bit shaky service","The rooms are nice, the 3 restaurants are good, the pool is very nice, the garden is great (especially when it does not smell of manure, like it did one night), the shopping gallery is classy, everything looks shiny and new. However during my one week business stay here (with a few coleagues) we had a couple of incidents so beware for this type of issues: 1. one of the meeting rooms we rented had a very powerful smell coming from the air conditioning. I complained at reception, they promised to ""fix it"", after one hour they had done nothing. I complained again, a manager came, acknowledged the problem, promised to give us another room. After another half hour, I asked the same manager what was going on, he said ""oh, didn't anyone notify you? your new room is waiting"". They‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 September 2010,4,Five star hotel three star service,This hotel has modern refurbished (smallish) bedrooms with well appointed bathrooms. The spa and pool are top class and the gardens very well maintained. The amenities could not be faulted however the service provided by staff was disappointingly inconsistent. Reception staff were either excellent or incompetent - the same as the pool and pool bar/restaurant staff. The spa was a treat and the service there was faultless. The hotel has a good gym and a couple of nice lookings bars and restaurants.,sofitel _rabat,rabat
 July 2010,3,Does not justify the price,"I had an extended stay in Sofitel in the month of July. I will make it simple and list the Pros and Cons: Pro: 1)Nice Location. 2)Very curteous staff. 3) Nice Bar. They give you free nuts and olives 4) Nice upgraded rooms 5) Elegant Cons: 1)Extremely expensive and poor value. Breakfast buffet costs $30, Lunch buffet $45. And these are no Dubai or Las Vegas buffets. You would expect a much ,much bigger spread to justify these prices. Ala Carte is no better. 2) Same menu with very little variation. 3)Laundry Svc:$9 for a shirt and I think I could iron it better. 4) Sofitel Pont system. You wont get any points unless you charge it to your own credit card. 5) You have to pay for internet. Day rate$35 Week$60 Overall I recommend staying and eating here if your company‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 July 2010,5,Superb Hotel,"The Sofitel Jardin des Roses is probably the best hotel in Rabat and is the newly revamped and renovated- to an extraordinarily high degree. The Hotel was formerly the Hilton- and some cab drivers still refer to it as such... so at the airport tell the cab to take you to the 'Hilton'! The design of the hotel is stunning, as the website will demonstrate. What the website does not tell you is the amazing facilities of the hotel. It has a STUNNING pool area- set in beautiful Andalusian Style gardens. There is a great pool-side cafe as well- white sun loungers and cabanas. There are at least a dozen hammocks around the gardens- terrific for an afternoon nap! The hotel also has two red clay tennis courts as well as an in-house tennis pro- and it is free to play with him! It does cost‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 June 2010,4,Nice,"It is a good, decent 4 or 5 star hotel. The staff really tries very hard to show respect to customers. A bit too much for my personal taste, as it is slightly exaggerated. Bar is absolutely great, with all the nice stuff including cigars. Hallway stinks a bit, but the room itself is ok. Only significant irritation is the cleaning lady coming into the room without knocking (at least I couldn't hear her knock.)",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 April 2010,3,"A real extravaganza, but keep an eye on extras and charges","Formerly Hilton, and apparently transferred to Sofitel quite recently. The reception & shops area, gardens, pool & spa, and the rooms are breath-takingly stylish and well decorated. Overall, classy hotel frequented by the cream of the cream of Rabat residents, too. It is located at some distance from city center, shops, restaurants and other sightseeing attractions. But taxis are relatively cheap in this country (provided that you bargain well and get yourself ready for paying one third or fourth of what they ask!), and combined with relatively light traffic of Rabat, location constitutes no major hussle. The restaurant serves fantastic breakfast and open buffet lunch with the best variety of taste of Moroccon food that I had while in this country. The same is hardly true for‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 March 2010,1,Useless,"Sure it's very fancy and stylish. But a practical or welcome place to stay? I could go on and on about this hotel: Useless bathroom (no shower function, just a bath, you have to sit in the bath to shower yourself with a showerhead with just 2 feet of tubing, impractical sink that sends water all over the place), useless lightling system (a dozen buttons but not one will turn on the light- till you find out they put the general switch right next to your bed), ridiculously expensive breakfast (35 dollars, anyone?), overpriced restaurant (not one vegetarian option, yes they did improvise pasta with tomato sauce, but for fifty bucks ?), and lest i forget, they'll make you feel like their fancy lobby is just way too stylish for you. They'll even treat your cab driver badly if he‚Ä¶",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 January 2010,2,One of best Hotels I've ever stayed.. Shame about the reception staff,"Probably one of the most stunning hotels I've stayed in, and I have been travelling for bussines for over 10 years. Faultless with the exception of the reception staff. Insolent, Snobs, you name it you'll find one of those in that reception. For the rest SUPERB",sofitel _rabat,rabat
 January 2010,5,Excellent,"We stayed over the New Year and took the ""I love Chocolate"" package for 4 nights at the price of 3 (book directly on the Sofitel site)- great service, fantastic breakfast,clean and staff were delightful. Set in a quiet oasis of lovely gardens near the Royal Palace - was formerly the Hilton. Some floors are still under renovation but all in all for the price we paid it was really good value and the beds were super comfortable so we got some good rest. Only downside was the New Years party was pretty boring but we realised the best place for ambience and to pass the New Year in Morocco would have been Marrakech. The Spa and fitness is new and is absolutely fantastic and jacuzza / hamman are free.You will enjoy this hotel and it's worth the money.",sofitel _rabat,rabat
