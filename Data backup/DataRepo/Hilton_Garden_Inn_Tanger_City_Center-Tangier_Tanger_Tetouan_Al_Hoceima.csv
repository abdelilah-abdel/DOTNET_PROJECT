The room was clean and well decorated. We ate at the restaurant for dinner and it was amazing food and service. Hotel is beside the Tanger City Mall and Tangier Beach.

Was asked what room I’m staying in by front security which I found very odd seeing as they were constantly seeing me in and out .

Opposite the railway station, next door to a mall with a supermarket. It's also about 30 minutes from the airport. There is well managed parking right outside the hotel. The only addition I would suggest with the room are tissues! The service was exceptional, Ferdous great at reception, Amal and Rajae were brilliant at breakfast along with a chef kept our active son entertained which allowed us to eat the brilliant breakfast in peace. The cleaner Fatima was efficient and cleaned and tidied our room fantastically. Last but not least was the doorman who was also really good with our son.

The receptionists were SO kind, and after hearing our story, gave us a discounted ocean view room and free breakfast for a very reasonable price. The breakfast was AMAZING! They had a huge selection of food and drinks, and also brought us Moroccan mint tea and fruity chocolate waffles while we ate!

We ordered room service for a pasta on 13th October 2019 at night, requesting 1 more fork and 2 more spare bowls for us. The dish delivered with only 1 set of cutlery. We called room service again and asked if the fork and bowls were coming. The staff apologised that she had forgot. I asked if she would send us later. However, only 2 more bowls came after a few minutes. Luckily the deliverer was smart enough to ask if we have other needs.

Hotel has security at the main door and a fairly attentive staff that speak French and English, probably Spanish as well. Nice buffet dinner and big breakfast. The rooms are large with comfortable beds and nice linens but basic amenities are missing. No hair dryer in the rooms or Kleenex! Ironing board but the iron is gone! But the biggest mistake is the decor. Nothing looks Moroccan or Arabic in either design or decoration. It could easily be a Hilton in Chicago or LA.

There seemed to be a problem with the check-in. After 20 minutes of no communication, I went to enquire if there was a problem. I was ignored & a while later given our card? We had booked a twin & a single room so why one room. They told us they had put all 3 of us in one room!! I refused this & asked them to sort it out as this is not what we had booked or paid for!!

We had mostly a positive experience with staff, especially in the breakfast room, who were very friendly. Staff usually speak Arabic, English and French. The fridge in room A wasn't working properly and it was replaced promptly. However, when we asked for a single bed instead of the sofa bed in the room, they would not remove the sofa bed so we eventually asked for the single bed to be removed as there wasn't space for both.

 April 2019,4,Feels like a five star hotel in-terms of great location & facilities but staff service quality requires improvements,"The hotel is located in a very good location, it is very close to the train station and has excellent sea view as well as many restaurants to eat near by. The hotel feels very new and the room are clean and spacious, however the staff service quality is not up to Hilton standards yet. When I first checked in the room, the front desk insist I haven’t pay in full yet for my booking, until I strongly insist they rechecked again, then they found out it was their mistake. Later when I enter the room around 7pm, my room was not cleaned yet, I see the staff is still trying to make up the beds from last guest. Then I found out the room was missing slippers and hair dryer which I requested half hour ago and still not send to my room yet, I had to call twice for the same request.

 April 2019,4,Perfect,"Have to say I’m a big fan of Tangier anyway but stepping out the train station to see the hotel in front was great. Check in easy and room spotless. Didn’t get a high floor but windows were super sound proof. Shower was lovely and powerful. Bar area downstairs was great and thought the breakfasts were the best in Morocco, although have to say the lack of Moroccan tea was a shame.

 March 2019,5,Friendly and Helpful to Everyone !,"First time in Morocco, here for business trip. I stepped out of the train station and i was looking for a taxi to go to hotel. I could not find anybody that speaks English well, strangely, i was told that taxis do not give receipts. I felt the need of double checking because it was not logical not giving a receipt and taxis all around the world tend to cheat. I looked for someone who can explain me this, tried to talk few people including police. None could speak english well. Desperately i saw Hilton Hotel right across the train station. Hoped someone could know english there.

We had an early morning check-out, and requested ""to go"" breakfast bags. The woman at the front desk acknowledged that. Imagine our surprise when, at 5:30 the next morning, with a taxi waiting to take us to the airport for our 8 am flight, no breakfast bags! So, although the rooms were lovely and we liked the location, service is equally as important.

 January 2019,5,Moroccan weeked getaway,"The hotel and staff were amazing at this property. Upon arrival and seeing how big my family was, they upgraded us to a king size suite on the top floor which was incredibly spacious. All the staff members knew us by name (probably because we were diamond members) and were very accommodating; especially during dining time. They offered us a private tour of Tangier which was very relaxing and not rushed at all. The location was perfect because as soon as you went outside, the mall was right next door and around the corner was another Hilton property in case you wanted to access different Restaurants and the swimming pool.

What an oasis! We decided to enjoy a luxurious breakfast. Although we later realised it's not the five-star Hilton we thought, we were not disappointed as the buffet breakfast was very nice. Views excellent overlooking the sea and mountains. We watched the sunrise views. Food good with variety. Ambience very cozy spacious and clean.

This is a very good property for families/kids/teens and there are a lot of them. Adjacent to a McDonalds and a food court at the mall next door. The beach area is an easy walk with a lot of entertainment options. A better hotel option for mobility needs since this and the sister property on the other side of the mall have elevators.

 December 2018,5,Overall Fantastic,"This is a great hotel. About 20 minute drive from the airport. They do not have a shuttle to the airport but you can request they arrange a taxi for you. The cost is about 250MAD vs 150-200MAD if you arrange a ride on your own. They are very clear about this when you make the request and you can decide if the convenience is worth it for you. There are security staff and a metal detector on your way in. I’m not used to this but I appreciated it, made me feel safe. The front desk staff were very pleasant and always ready and willing to help. The rooms are spacious and clean. The ocean view is really a must!

 November 2018,5,Great service from both front desk and restaurant staff,"We found that this Hilton is not standard like other Hilton properties around the world. We reserved an ocean-view room but did not have a full ocean-view (only saw a corner of the ocean). Room amenities were quite basic. I was surprised that there was no hair dryer in the room. I had to call the front desk to request one which I never had to do at any American chain hotels! We had breakfasts for two mornings, and frankly, their breakfast selections were limited. However, the staff at the restaurant were providing great service. One of the female servers remembered on the second morning that I had mentioned my coffee was hot the day before, and personally prepared cappuccinos for me (instead of from the machine).

It was the experience we expected from a Hilton hotel, with the exception of hotel staff which were exceedingly welcoming, friendly, and helpful above expectations from a large hotel. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Internet was dependable. The breakfast was tasty and extensive. The hotel is in a nice area, close to the shoreline and across the street from the train station though rather far from the Medina (30 minute walk or short taxi ride). Also next to a large mall. In summary, we had a pleasant experience at the Hilton Garden Inn. This is a much different experience than you would have staying in the Medina at a Riad, but is a comfortable alternative next to the train station.",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 November 2017,4,"Basic decent 4-Star property, good for a short stay","We stayed here 2 nights. It’s biggest positive is the convenient location - there’s a mall right next to the hotel (which has a supermarket, many eating options and a cinema), beach is literally across the street and the old town (Grand Socco) is a 25min stroll along the beach. Rooms are very basic though the sea view rooms do have a good view over the beach and on to the sea. Breakfast had a decent spread with a hot station making fresh omelettes. However overall the service was mediocre at best. Each table had a sign saying we could order the coffee and hot dishes with the waiter, but when we tried we were told it’s self service. This meant each guest had to stand in a long queue stressing the poor one chap making the eggs!

Although when we arrived there was no record of the reservation- I think this was more a function of very last minute booking through Booking.com-regardless when we arrived at 9AM they were able to accommodate us immediately. Also, I was able to book the room for the day rate since we were only staying for 10 hours-which was great! The room itself was modern, clean and comfortable.

That was fine, until we were checking in and the gentleman who dropped us off called the hotel from his cell phone outside and the receptionist handed us the phone. They were both trying to sell us camel rides + tours, before we even got upstairs! It was extremely unprofessional and rude for her to have handed us the phone, assuming we wanted to talk to this stranger. The room was very clean and comfortable.

I stayed on the 13th floor and the girl who did the housekeeping there was great, very helpful and did a good job. The hotel does not have a pool or any outside space actually but I think this is the usual for the Garden Inn brand , as they are more a business style place to stay I believe. ( I have stayed in 3 of them before) There is a popular bar area on the ground floor which is a good meeting point.

I had to send couple of emails, call the hotel couple of times, send an escalation to the WW Hilton…. In order to get an answer after more than 3 weeks. It seems that the hotel has lost some of the good employees (Mehdi, Hafsa…) and this has impacted the quality of the front office service.

 July 2017,2,Disappointed with Staff. No pool access. West side rooms overlook stagnant pond. Poor internet.,"Disappointed with the staff at the two Hiltons in Tangier, Morocco. Not up to Hilton standards. No pool at the Hilton Garden Inn, but one at the new Hilton around the corner. Part of a large group reservation at both hotels. Told we could use the pool at the other Hilton by our group leader. Refused by the manager of the new Hilton when we walked there (Younice) & policy repeated by the staff at the Garden Inn while we were at the desk in our swimsuits. Not good for customer service. My room view is of a construction site & a stagnant pool out the west side of the hotel. Recommend rooms on the north (beach) & east side for better views. Very challenging internet service made it tough to complete a review.",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The hotel is very near a nice sandy beach and the main avenue along the ocean with all the restaurants, bars and cafes.

The house keeping service is very good and I would like to thank Houda Boukhenfira. The breakfast is also good and varied. The only problem was with the parking space: sometimes the parking lot is full and they send you from one level to another. Also, every time we entered the parking they asked us the room number.

Old médina is about 5-10mins taxi. Besides the hotel is the Tanger city mall. The room is spacious, comfortable and clean. We ate dinner at the hotel. It was buffet. The hot dishes are few but tasty.

There is a kettle with tea and coffee, fridge and safe. There was ample storage as well and a very effective heating and cooling system. Breakfast was plentiful and the seating area was large, so there was no crowding in the area, which can happen sometimes.

Complimentary: welcome dish with fruit - apples, oranges, kiwis, banana), coffee/tea facilities with range of tea bags, two bottles of water & one pair of slippers (a room for 2 should have two pairs, shouldn't it?).

It was personally a nice change to be in a western hotel when typically we opt for Riads. We chose this hotel since we were taking the ferry to Tarifa, Spain, and the port was literally down the street and around the corner from the hotel.

 July 2016,1,STAY AWAY!,"I do not like to write negative reviews , however in this case I felt it necessary. I booked this room four months prior to our trip from the USA.I planned to stay 2 nights at the hotel. I am a diamond member and travel rather extensively. Sometimes people complain when things happen that are beyond the hotels control -I don't. The hotel must remember that no matter where its location, it is still an American corporation with loyal members-both male and female. I called several times to confirm the upper floor corner room with full ocean view. The hotel confirmed. Furthermore, up to a week before arrival the hotel seemed to be pretty vacant and each time i called the hotel to make sure all was in order, I was assured that it was 3 days before the trip i had an unexpected…",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2016,4,Good Value with Predictable Standards,"We were quite pleased with this hotel for are brief stay in Tangier.

 April 2016,5,Good hotel. Good location.,"Good Hotel : This is a new hotel so the rooms are modern and spotless. We had the room in the corner next to the gym and it was really very spacious. Comfortable king sized bed. Good Location : This hotel is near the corniche and is adjacent to a new mall that has opened in the center of Tanger, which makes it very convenient as you can easily pass the time walking around the mall. You can catch a movie at the theaters, get a bite to eat at the food hall, and buy a little something from the supermarket downstairs. Cons: I would say that parking could be an issue once the hotel is full because we had a hard time finding space in front of the hotel a couple of times during our stay. I could be wrong but I'm not aware of any other dedicated parking spaces.",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The rooms are well designed, the dining room choices not elaborate but well chosen, and the staff friendly and efficient. They are all comfortable in English, Arabic, French, and Spanish. I recognized some of the staff from other quality hotels in Morocco, so the employees are also aware that the Hilton chain is a good employer. The Internet is sometimes quite slow, but this is a city-wide problem. HGI management should join many other businesses and cultural institutions in asking for better service.

 May 2016,3,Garden Inn hotel with No Garden!,As a new Hilton hotel I expected much better facilities. There is nowhere to sit out and relax with a drink. In warm weather one doesn't want to sit indoor in a small bar. There was no swimming pool and no Spa. We had to go to another hotel in town for this. Whilst the beach was very close by it was very dirty and unappealing. The hotel is ideal for someone who just needs the room and breakfast and doesn't require the facilities usually provided in an international hotel. There is a shopping complex very near for those who like that but in a place like Tangier it is far more interesting to visit the Casbah.,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 April 2016,3,Nice location,"Nearby a mall, beach and restaurants, easy to get a taxi, nearby a gare tanger ville, a train station that connected to other important city as Asillah, Rabat, Casablanca, Marakesh and Fes. Menu for breakfast need to be improved as it is the same everyday. It is bored if stay more than 2 days with the same breakfast menu.",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2016,4,Very good business hotel,"Hilton Garden Inn Tanger is brand new opened in March 2016 and so everything feels and smells brand new. Its the first Hilton property in Morocco. Very helpful professional staff. Good wifi, pleasant relaxing ambience throughout the hotel suited to the business traveller more than the leisure market. I would be more than happy to recommend this hotel.",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 April 2016,5,Great hotel in a great City,"This is an excellent new hotel, superb location and outstanding staff. The breakfast buffet is second to none. Tangier is a great safe town and it shattered our stereotype the Morroco is full of beggres and pick-pocket. None is true in Tangier. One thing that makes hotel stand out is that the universal utility plug is installed in the wall. So, one need not ask for a converter/transformer in using the American plugs. I did not find this feature in any other hotels we stayed in Europe. Keep up the good work!!!",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2016,5,First to stay,"I stayed here during a business trip to Tangiers. The hotel was selected by the supplier and the hotel agreed to open for us before their official opening on 1/3/16. The rooms were spotless, the gym was well appointed and the staff were keen to help wherever possible. Breakfast was fantastic and the fresh omelettes were cooked to order. Great hotel and I will stay again if I return to Tangiers.",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2016,2,Mediocre,"We could not find the hotel as we tried to go into the main, not yet opened Hilton. The workers had no idea how to send us to the Hilton Garden Inn down the road. Then, upon check-in told Breakfast was not included even though my reservation said it was. The room didn't have a sheet on the pull out sofa bed and never arrived even though requested. One elevator didn't work and we just stood around waiting. Not happy.",Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2016,5,Totally impressed - fabulous place and amazing staff!,Amazing place very clean and well located next door to McDonalds and kFC as well as Pizza Hut...the best variety of breakfast and the most pleasant Staff...credit to Hafsa at the reception desk who was always smiling and most willing to help. She even helped with directions and places to visit. I would book again...we lost 3 nights here due to the French Public Service Strikes. Beautiful scenery but a lot of development going on which will hopefully be finished in 6 months - hotel is joint to the developing mall and cinema...I can't wait!,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 March 2016,2,Was truly what I was not expecting,Waited 6 months for it to open was expecting something much better than the other hotels that I stayed was disappointed. On arrival they did not find my reservation as a Hilton member had to fill in all the details that normally as a member they already had. Went to the bar for a club sandwich and he sent me to the restaurant for this service was very bad took 15 minutes to bring a Coca Cola 30 minutes for the sandwich and desert the same what was to have been a quick dinner took longer than an hour.,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Hilton_Garden_Inn_Tanger_City_Center,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
