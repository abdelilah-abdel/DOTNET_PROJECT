 November 2022,1,WARNING TO ALL FEMALE TRAVELERS!,"This hotel was a real problem from the start. The booking was made mistakenly while holidaying in Morocco thinking it was Ibis Tangier central location. My sister and I tried to rectify the problem on many occasions before our check in but it was just mission impossible to cancel our booking. We tried on the premises as a last attempt once we realised how FILTHY and SMELLY the whole place is. The cancellation page come as ""error"" every single time even if the information required are: name + reservation number. At 4 o'clock in the morning and having been fast asleep; my sister and I were suddenly awoken by the smashing noise of our door lock closing. I run to the door and opened it to see the back of a tall guy wearing black clothing (We have no idea how long he was inside).

 August 2022,1,Bad experience,The smell of urine wafts from the toilet into the room Bid's light switches don't work No Pool just in the pictures A lot of insects like ants and mosquitoes It's was a bad experience in this hotel Three is a free parking Close to the airport. .. .,Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2022,3,Close to the airport but that's it.,"Close to the airport but far away from the city. The room was ok and the bed too but the the breaktfast was a joke. There are two restaurants across the street and a small store too.That is a good option for food and especially drinks,cause you can not by anything at all at the hotel .The owners of Ibis should have done an inspection here and i hope you read this. If want to go down town you can by the way take the bus number 9A down to Place du Kowait and you are down in the City Center. It takes about 40-45 minutes.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2020,3,Good location to airport,"The hotel is in a good location to the airport for those early/late flights. The staff were friendly. The rooms are small but clean. There was a sewage smell coming from the shower, which needs sorting out.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,1,Don't go!!,"The rooms are INCREDIBLE SMALL, no shampoo, thin towels, poor service and completely disappointing the amount that needs to be payed to take a taxi to the airport. Basically, you will pay THE SAME AMOUNT for a taxi as you will be taking it from a hotel near the train station to the airport (15 euros). So going there if you need an early flight is not worth it. Also, we asked the receptionist to book a taxi for us for next day to the airport for 5 people and the taxi that came was one for 3 people. USELESS, we had to wait 20 min more for a new taxi to arrive and our whole schedule was messed up. ps. Bathroom was full of mold",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2019,3,Not what I'd hoped for,"Ibis hotels are usually pretty good, but this one disappointed. I specifically asked for a quiet room. I knew I'd be up late on the second night of my stay. I was woken all too early by construction outside my window. Were there no rooms available on the other side of the building, or on a higher floor? Very disappointed.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2019,4,"Good hotel, close to airport.","The hotel is conveniently located a few km from the airport, which you can access by taxi (around 100MAD) or a 40 minute walk. The room was very clean with a good shower and hotel staff were helpful. The journey from the city (near bus station) to hotel cost around 60MAD with a grand taxi.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2019,5,PERFECT for TNG early flights!,"This was the PERFECT overnight for me as I had an early morning flight to MAD from the perfectly-sized TNG! Checking went quite smoothly and thus fine hotel has a LIFT/ELEVATOR! The eatery across the street gave me the nourishment my body required. I woke early, then fell asleep, but fortunately, the super staff here knew about my flight and knocked on my door even though I hadn’t requested a wake up call. Talk about superior service, above-and-beyond! [I guess it would have been obvious since I did reserve a cab for the early delivery to TNG, but I’m so appreciative of their thoughtfulness.] The facilities are excellent, especially in-room WiFi, hot water, and comfortable bed. Overall, this is a GREAT place to stay when flying in/out of TNG late/early, and I highly recommend…",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2018,1,One night,"I don't recommend this hotel at all... the service not that good....I pay for breakfast but there's no coffee at morning.. or even a good breakfast, they have bad towels for shower. Hotel not even clean.. been in ibis before but this one not real ibis..",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2018,3,Basic accommodation & well-worn facilities,"Friendly and efficient Reception but book online because the 'rack rate' is very overpriced, good location near airport and adjacent to major highway, adequate in-house parking, well-worn furnishings and bed, decent nearby restaurants.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2018,3,"Hotel fine, but beware the taxi rip off","The hotel itself is totally fine, perfect for the airport, but if the staff offer to set up a taxi for you to the airport (a less than five minute drive) you will be charged the same cost as a 20km drive. When our driver arrived he clearly knew the staff member and we felt that we were being hugely ripped off, which is really poor considering that their whole business is basically people who need to shuttle to the nearby airport. Very poor form.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2018,3,Convenient Location to Airport and Tangier Free Zone.,"This property location is a plus. especially for people who are flying the next day from Tangier Airport or Having express business in the Free zone. It is however, 25 to 30 minutes from city center. You don't have to expect much considering the prices. cleaning is a bit wanting. I could have been upgraded since most of the hotel rooms were available. they did not and prefer to let me occupy a 4 beds room !!! not that spacey.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2018,3,Half night on arrival,"Small hotel with basic amenities and mold in bathroom, nothing to enjoy, but location! It serves main purpose: spend a night on arrival or departure. We arrived at midnight and were happy to relax until early morning. The service was friendly. A man near main entry imitated ""help"" for parking and got his tips. Location: it is very close to airport, the road is paved and has street lights, the hotel sign is clearly visible at night from the road, so driving rental car on arrival was easy.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2017,3,Clean and cheap,"Stayed for 7 days. Breakfast was very basic and did not change during the whole stay. It was cleaned every day so a big plus. Quite far away from the center but there are buses going very close to the hotel and are very cheap (3 dirham), however you need to be cautious and shout to the driver to stop while coming back from the city as they do not always stop. Very silent, nice surrounding plus a petrol station with a shop in case you need water as there is no supermarket around.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2018,3,Good for sleeping..,The hotel is basic but it’s what you expect. The rooms are clean and it’s a good nights sleep. The rooms are quiet and the air conditioning works which is good! Don’t get room 230 if you need WiFi as it doesn’t work in there. The showers are hot and toilets fairly clean. For £20 a night you can hardly complain! Breakfast is basic and the coffee is no good.,Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2018,4,Good place to stay if you arrive in Tangier on one of those late night flights,"Very reasonably priced budget hotel for an overnight stay before venturing out in your hire car. Very close to the airport with only a couple of right turns to negotiate - in general driving at night in Morocco is a bit like reprising a 1930s black and white film - much safer in daytime when you can see unmarked obstacles clearly. Rooms are small and basic, staff seemed helpful, directing me to a cafe and minimart across the circle which were open late on Sunday. Our price for an overnight stay with a bit of buffet breakfast for two was roughly the same as lunch for two at Nandos in Gatwick - now that is value !",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2018,3,Ibis Budget Tanger,"our check-out was not good at all ! and the staff working inside the hotel it's not professional , to noisy . the receptionniste was not good with as at the check-out , so so so arrogant ! - about the Room ( the lights of bed it's not working ) !",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2017,3,Adequate Hotel by the Airport in Need of Improvements,"Pros: Located near the airport Front desk staff speak good English Rooms are a good size with everything you need from TV, good air unit and hot shower Cons: The rooms are showing their wear, grimy mold in the shower grout, stained walls and a general feel that the room needs to be renovated. The hotel over charges for taxi service, the airport is only a five minute drive away and they charge 150 MAD. The taxi driver that dropped me off at the airport informed me a taxi from the hotel to the airport should not cost more than 30 MAD. The hotel is clearly taking advantage of guests.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,2,Nothing good about this hotel,"It's a gloomy and a messy hotel . The corridor was the dirtiest I have ever seen , the room was so basic but that's OK keeping in mind how much they charge . We booked it one night before arriving to Tanger during the month of August so we didn't have much of options. It is very far from the rest of the city. It is located in the free zone, so you will not find a city cab, you will only find white cabs and they charge 100 Dhrs for one way to take you to the city center or the train station. It will be good for those who want to spend a single night at a cheap rate , catch a flight the next day and don't care much about details and tidiness . I will never stay there again.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,3,OK,"Basic, but adequate. Air conditioning wasn't working but they transferred us to another room no problem. Only complaint is the suspected wrought between the hotel and the taxi companies. A 100 DH fee to drive the 3 ks from the airport to the hotel is ridiculous (150 DH to the airport at 3.30am the next morning). The hotel could easily provide a shuttle service for 1/2 the cost.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2016,3,Adequate and clean for price,Have stayed here on at least 3 occasions now when either going to or coming from the ferry and find the whole experience perfectly adequate and clean for the price. Can be a bit impersonal. Only paid the extra for breakfast once. Free wifi. Toilet doors would be more efficient if door handle on the inside!,Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2016,5,Every single thing perfect only the room,I was staying in this hotel 2 days with my friend every thing was good we book a room in booking.com and it was a fast checking but the challenge is the room its very smal for 2 people but we enjoy this two days there,Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2016,5,Great value for money!,"I was there because of a early flight next morning. Great value for money! It's very cheap, but you really have everything you need. Just don't forget to bring your own shampoo and shower gel. Also the breakfast is very much sufficient and cheap to have something in the morning before you leave. Although personel does not speak good English, they are extremely friendly and helpful. The only thing I can complain about is the very bad wifi connection. This surely needs improvement.",Ibis_Budget_Tanger-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima,Ibis_Budget_Tanger,Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2015,4,Different but ok,We usually stay in the Ibiz Budget Hotels as they are simple neat and clean. The one in Tangier also meets the Ibiz standards but it should be better maintained. In the shower there was some back stuff on the tiles and some stuff in between the tiles missing. The Space between the Toitett and the door in order to... let's see if I can put this as a review friendly comment. ...in order to use the toilette paper you are required to open the toilet door 😆😆😆😆😆 that did not stay closed in the first place. So much to the room ☺☺ still a good stay all though we found that the blanked had its own life at night 😈😈😈 the staff in the Hotel spoken Arabic English and French and we're very very friendly.
