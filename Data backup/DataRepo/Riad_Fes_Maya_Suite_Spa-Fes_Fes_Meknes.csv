 January 2023,5,A complete Fez experience.,"We had such a lovely experience here at this hotel. It might be a bit of a surprise walking up to the main door but then, after being greeted by the lovely friendly staff Hamid and Anwar you arrive into the hotel which is a feast for the eyes. Samae, who is the manager went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. She organised trips and sightseeing tours for us and nothing was a problem for her. The spa was excellent and the staff were wonderful. I would highly recommend if you want a total Moroccan experience.",Riad_Fes_Maya_Suite_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,hotelName,city
 January 2023,5,"Spectacular location, great staff","The riad is a medieval palace which was carefully restored after a 6-year long study. The Suite Royal was amazing, with a spatious bathroom and great bed. The restaurant too was high class, with three courses at a very reasonable price. Sama and all her staff were always kind and available to support in our all needs and questions. Super recommended!!!",Riad_Fes_Maya_Suite_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Fes_Maya_Suite_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes

I think it's worth a visit to see the views of the city and have a great time. The location was well chosen and the golden elevator is the bomb for this place. it's hard to find the entrance, but you can do it, because it's a great adventure",Riad_Fes_Maya_Suite_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Fes_Maya_Suite_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
