 January 2023,4,"Beautiful Riad, Great Base in Medina","We loved the atmosphere of calm, exquisite attention to authentic styling and excellent care of guests by Anwar and his team. This building, though repsired and renovated many times over the years, is a 300 yo building. The steps are terrifyingly crooked and steep. And yet modern conveniences like a lift could well ruin the charm and sense of staying in a rich Fassian Uncle's residence. Loved the Green room despite its medieval feeling bathroom. Blue and Yellow rooms were our other choices and share a common sitting room which was lovely.",Riad_Laaroussa_Hotel_and_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,hotelName,city

 November 2022,5,Great place to stay in Fes,"We stayed in the Orange room at the Riad which was beautiful decorated and spacious. The Riad itself is well decorated, all the floors had beautiful spaces and with places to relax inside and out but had good weather so we didn’t spend too much time in the inside rooms. The pool was a great way to relax after a long day of touring. The roof deck was a beautiful spot for both eating and having a sunset drink. And the lobby area was a garden oasis to relax in. The food was very good and most importantly the staff were super friendly and amazing. Thank you to Malik, Anwar, and Yassiin for helping to make it a perfect stay. And we also met Fred, the owner, who was also very nice and helpful. We would definitely return next time we are in Fes.",Riad_Laaroussa_Hotel_and_Spa-Fes_Fes_Meknes,Riad_Laaroussa_Hotel_and_Spa,Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2022,5,Lucky us!,"Thank you thank you to Journey beyond Travel for arranging for my husband, myself and 3 friends to stay at the fabulous Riad LAAROUSSA, in the Medina of Fes. As soon as the non-descript door in a non-descript alleyway opens, you realize how special and enchanting this Riad is. Each of the 8 rooms is incredibly spacious and comfortably furnished with so many interesting artistic touches. Also, the public spaces including the pool are fabulous.We felt like we were in a magnificent Moroccan home and were incredibly spoiled by the whole staff, but especially Anwar and Yaseen who were beyond kind and helpful and lovely to chat with. Breakfast was served on the large and stunning roof terrace overlooking Fez and we ate delicious dinners there - one as the full moon was rising!

It is a feast for the soul and the eyes - everything has been renovated with such care and good taste - with many artistic features that add authenticity and a sense of the history of the place, especially the great B&W photos of the renovation and the people involved. People are a big part of this Riad - everyone was so friendly and attentive to our needs, Yassin was outstanding, and the kitchen team generous with their tips!

This day was made all the better as it was my partners birthday and she did not have a great start to the day and was very down.

 October 2022,5,Made our Fes experience exceptional,"Such a lovely place. I think we appreciated this Riad all the more because we switched after our first night from a very unexceptional one. The place is thoughtful and beautiful — every room, common space, pool and rooftop with fantastic views. The restaurant is delicious for both dinner and breakfast. The hammam at the spa was great. The service is so good that we were confused as to who was the owner as everyone who works there acts like an owner in their fantastic hospitality.

Also, definitely have dinner here.
