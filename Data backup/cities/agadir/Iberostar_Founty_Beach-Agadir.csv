 January 2023,5,Lovely winter sun holiday at a great hotel,"We have just returned from Founty beach. We had a lovely 9 days. The hotel is by an amazing beach. The food was great. There is plenty of choice. When reviews have talked about repetition I would say there is so much choice repetition doesn't matter. Soups, meat, salads, fish, cheese, pasta, fresh vegetables and lots of fruit and desserts. Kids get their own food station. Room was large. Rooms face north and south so request a south facing sunny room. We had a basic room which was on the sunny side and had a side seaview but did overlook a derelict hotel. But we had a sunset every evening. The best rooms are pool / garden/ sea view with sun. The pool area and pool bar is lovely. Late breakfast and lunch at the pool bar is a nice touch. The entertainment team work hard. We…",hotelName,city,Unnamed: 6
 August 2022,5,Great hotel and amazing staff,"This is my third holiday in Agadir and I have to say This is a great hotel for family. Great atmosphere too. The staff are polite and helpful and nothing is too much. The reception team are informative and happy to help. My daughter forgot her iPhone and nike bag on the reception desk and they kept safe till we went back to collect. The rooms are spacious, big balconies and cleaned daily, bed made, with enough clean white and stain free towels and toilet papers..The laundry service is quite reasonable price as well. The Spa is AMAZING, booked it twice full packages with my 2 kids. Little bit on the pricey side but worth every penny.

 December 2022,5,New Years Eve Stay,"Hotel is beautiful, clean and in great location - just meters away from amazing beach. We had a great stay with 3 children 5/11/14 Night entertainment was great for first two nights, but even thou the dancers were really good it is the same show -different costumes every night, would be nice to have variety. Food is nice, only issue if you like to have a breakfast outside, there is no salads there which we missed a lot. Only 'food' which was not great is ice cream,just did not taste nice. Agadir market is amazing!! 2 outdoor pools are great, one is heated - 2nd one absolutely freezing this time of the year. If you have children that are too big for armbands but can't swim alone, they will not be allowed into the heated pool as it is too deep on their own - only with…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2022,4,Beautiful hotel but security man needs to be trained in manners.,It has taken me a while to write this review because I really wanted to give this hotel 5 stars but I cannot because of an incident that happened with one of the hotels so called security guards. The GREAT parts of this hotel I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights between 10th December-19th December 2022 The hotel is as beautiful if not more beautiful than the photos. The cleaners who buff the reception floor need a medal it is absolutely gleaming at all times. The food is amazing different choices and everything always tasted fresh and the hot food was always hot. The food ranged from tasty salads to seafood to tagines to Italian food to sushi. Each night there must have been 20 different deserts and most were different each night. The fresh juices on a morning were amazing…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2022,4,Perfect Winter sun destination,"Absolutely delivered what we wanted from an AI hotel close to the beach 2 weeks before Christmas, with a few exceptions. + points: Lovely resort, 30 mins taxi from the airport, 2 mins walk to the beach, 10/15 mins walk to nice cafes and restaurants. O Playa, Jade Fusion and El Toro all very good and next to each other. Modern spacious room with lovely walk-in rainforest shower, huge comfy bed, terrace looking out over the pool. Block 3 gets the sun all day. Heated pool and plenty of entertainment/activities if you want to participate. Evening entertainment of a good standard but very 'samey' if you stay for more than a week. Buffet restaurant extremely good with plenty of choice but again a bit 'samey' if you stay more than a week and self serve drinks and went out of their…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Entertainment good, food and drink has good variety and Always more than enough . Very clean and spacious rooms . Spa is amazing and good value .

 January 2023,5,Clean resort next to the Ocean with delicious food in buffet setting,"The resort was clean and it’s located right next to the beach. There’s a relaxing spa, gym, and program for children. Usually I do not like the food in all inlusive restaurants but the food was very delicious and there was a lot of variety at Iberostar Founty Beach. For visiting other places, taxi is needed. The reception at the hotel did not help for neither in finding a taxi nor finding out the price level. That was the only downside during our stay. Luckily there is Tripadvisor :)",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

The staff were all very friendly and helpful, but several staff members in particular really stood out. Rony was always smiling and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. He even joined us in dancing in the evening and was happy to help with any questions or requests we had during our stay.

 December 2022,5,Fantastic!!! We loved it.,"Wow!! Just home after Christmas here with husband and teenager. It is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. The staff are friendly and helpful, all of them! The room was 3161 with a sea view that was exactly that, beautiful to watch sunsets from. Downside we didnt get the sun onto the balcony but we were out by the pool all day. Great location just a little walk over the promenade to the beach. The sea was rough but you can manage a dip. The hotel has a cordoned off beach with security. Food excellent with a huge variety, beach bar serves meals too. All the toilets are exceptionally clean, even the poolside one which can get wet, not here! Regularly cleaned and disinfected. Entertainment is the usual standard but done with enthusiasm and energy. Animation team second to…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,5,Would return and recommend,"Great experience at this hotel. I've read other reviews and its not 5 star for sure. If you want 5 star Dont go here as its clearly not, the hotel does require upkeep and if you don't like kids - definately avoid and go to an adults only resort as this is very family friendly. If you're looking for a good family holiday and have younger kids, its great. Theres really nothing for older kids/teens despite a program on show, but the little kids 4+ had an array of activities every day a few times a day and the girls running it were fantastic, especially Usalla and Eman. The food was quite bland and repetitive, but cooked fresh and if you like fish dishes and seafood you're in luck. The evening entertainment wasn't to my taste but give them credit they did try and engage with…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2022,4,Relaxing stay,"Overall we did have a very positive relaxing stay here, the food buffet was great, it has something for everyone.... on a side note the pizza by the pool bar though was nicer and crisper (according to my husband). Which i would agree... maybe they had a better oven there... I quite like where the hotel situated, kind of more at the end of the beach, we enjoyed the sunset every evening from our room which was a huge plus... thank you iberostar staff for our room : ) There were some hiccups in the beginning, where the check in took so long and there were some miscommunication with the staff and the wifi connection took so long to connect as they wanted to see a confirmation email. Then we had to pay for city tax and the pool towels (100dh deposit in cash). Then when we got to…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Hotel is very organised, the staff everyone very polite, professional and helpful everytime you ask for help. Entertainmment team always smile and all day working hard to make people happy .Position of the hotel right in front of the beach which is also great, private separated sunbeds with umbrellas so no one comes directly to buy anything ( I mean the locals ), 2 outdoor swimming pools - one always heated so nice to swim in December, SPA and indoor swimming pool great. I can't…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2022,4,Too good to be true? £614 for 8 nights All-Inclusive?,"Watch the in depth review on YouTube at Luxury Vegan Travel. I arrived at Iberostar Founty Beach (Hotel) on 27 November 2022 and stayed for 8 nights. I checked in with Fatima who was warm and friendly. Checkin was simple and smooth. Next to the checkin desk was a currency exchange board. At the time, Google showed £1 (British Pound) = 12.93 Dirhams and the hotel were offering 12.206! Normally there is a larger mark up at hotels and so I expected it to be something like 11.206, so this was a nice surprise. This is important as you will need 100 Dirhams to pay as a deposit for your beach/pool towel. Beach/Pool towel – you will receive a card (similar to a room key card) once you have paid the 100 Dirhams deposit. You will then need to take the card to the pool area and…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Generally the cleanliness of the hotel is always great, the staff are extremely friendly and we always have an amazing time. Huge thank you to the animation team for always keeping us entertained - morning, day and night! :) Finally needless to say Agadir is just an incredible city, and to be tanning in 25+ degree heat on Christmas Day is surreal.

Staff speak a variety of languages but I must admit I did find a couple of them to be abit unpleasant the rest were very nice. Another tip, download the app, we weren’t advised to do this but you need the app to make the most of your stay.

 November 2022,3,Average hotel. Food good. Staff great. Beachfront a big plus,Greeted in reception by a tour company rep trying to intercept us before we reached reception. Lady behind reception not happy with him and gave him a ticking off but not a great start. Sent away for lunch before given an early checkin 1.30 hr early without an extra charge as we had a small baby. Little in the way of information regarding restaurants/activities/main areas - something that we usually are given a quick idea about when we first check in from past experiences. Room itself was quite poor in quality. No safe in room. No kettle or tea/coffee making facilities. Dusty/mould smell in room. Curtains with holes. Hair from previous. residence of room on walls of bathroom. Just gave off a vibe of budget hotel 2-3 stars at max. Internet was pretty poor and quite patchy.…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

We went 23-30th November & stayed in room 1210. As frequent Iberostar visitors this is a contender for favourite. The selection of food was excellent with many Moroccan dishes alongside more popular choices such as pasta, salad bar, paella, pizza etc. I pewrsonally enjoyed the tagine dishes & the meat stuffed Moroccan flatbread (medfouna?) Bar service was exceptional both in the pool bar & in the hotel. Special thanks to bar manager Mohammed, & rests of the team including Ayoub, Saber & Arbdullah.

 November 2022,5,Great hotel for winter sun,"First of all, I have to say I have no negative comments about this hotel, we had a fabulous two week holiday. The room was perfectly comfortable and very clean, the bathroom shower amazing, powerful with plentiful hot water immediately available. Being away for two weeks I particularly appreciated the little clothes dryer on the balcony. I was able to wash through clothes every couple of days and they dried beautifully. I didn't ask for an iron as I took my own little travel iron bought many years ago in France which was perfect. We were in room 1255, on the south side of the hotel which was described as having a limited view of the sea, though I have to say the view was amazingly good, and the balcony had sun all day long. The sunsets were particularly wonderful. I was a…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2022,5,Brilliant hotel,"The hotel is perfectly located on a stretch of golden sands. It looks impressive from the outside and has beautiful landscaped gardens.

 November 2022,4,Great holiday,Spent a week here at the end of November. Check in at reception not the best. The lady we dealt with spoke very poor English and appeared disinterested and dismissive. (All the other reception staff were really helpful throughout the week). Room was large and comfy. Cleaners did a great job. Lots of storage space. Had to pay extra for safe and kettle. Small fridge in room which was great. Free bottled water available from the bar. Restaurant and bars - good choice of all inclusive drinks. Great cocktails. Pool bar open till 6pm and lots of choice of food and drinks there plus cakes and snacks late afternoon. Main restaurant had huge choice of food and plenty of tables. Our only concern was that the food was lukewarm at best. We did speak to a manager about this but nothing…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,4,a very nice hotel on the beach,"We stayed here for 10 nights and had a very nice time. The hotel was comfortable and clean and on the whole the staff were friendly. The food was good in both the main buffet restaurant and pool bar , but it did start to get a little repeadative by the end. Only 2 things slightly annoyed me where the fact that the SPA didn't seem to take credit cards ( this is meant to be a 4 star place) and the fact that you got better service if you tipped. I don't actually have a issue with tipping, but getting hold of small coins or notes was next to impossible , I would rather pay extra for the holiday and not have to bother!!.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,3,The Staff are a great credit to this hotel and make your stay a success.,"The Staff in this Hotel are absolutely wonderful. Most of them deserve credit but I would in particular like to mention - Abdul and his Manager who provided an excellent service in the evening bar. Their customer service was superb. Others who also deserve special mention are young Said - waiter in the Restaurant, Yassine (Happy Man) in Entertainment - a cheerful and delightful person who even helped to carry my rucksack when he saw me struggling even though I did not have any money left to give him a tip, nor was it his job, Mehdi and Rachid at Reception and last but not least the ever smiling and helpful Guest Relations Manager - Ayoub. The other elements to mention that were regretful was that unfortunately they did not allow a Moroccan guide that I wanted to organise our…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 November 2022,5,Lovely stay.,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights November 23rd - November 26th 2022. Absolutely fantastic hotel!! We could not fault anything about it. Our room was great, very spacious on the ground floor. The walk in shower was great👌 The maid came in EVERY day, cleaned, made the beds and changed the towels. The restaurant was a decent size and big enough to cater for its guests. I'm a fussy eater but there was always something to eat. I'm not normally a dessert person, however the cakes were fab! The reception area looked the part very nice, the outside terrace was great with plenty of seating. A nice bar area, the drinks on the All Inclusive were drinkable and the wine was very drinkable! The pool area was huge, sunbeds were spread out enough to not feel on top of others. …",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,5,A well maintained and run resort hotel in sunny Agadir,"We really enjoyed 4 days here. A beautiful resort hotel. Everything clean and well maintained. We enjoyed the food. I think that there was something for everyone. It was all cooked beautifully and I particularly liked the Moroccan food. One of the pools was heated, which was very welcome. We didn't do the activities but enjoyed the evening showtime. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. All inclusive isn't our usual choice but it was such good value for four days in the sun. We've been to Morocco numerous times and love the country, culture, and its people. Agadir isn't typically Moroccan, more European really but it does have a beautiful promenade and sparkling clean sandy beach. The sea is a bit rough for swimming, but popular with surfers. There is little traditional…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,5,"Excellent, great holiday","Having previously stayed at the Iberostar in Marrakech, I was hoping that this hotel would live up to expectations and it certainly did! We have recently returned from a great weeks holiday and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel. Rooms were comfortable and spotlessly clean. We had a balcony overlooking the street to the side and a view towards the sea front, just! To be fair we didn’t spend much time in the room or on the balcony as we spent the days lazing around the 3 pools and extensive gardens within the hotel complex. Sunbeds are comfortable and there's loads of them so no need for the 6am towel sketch. The food was excellent and their was masses of choice. It isn’t fine dining, just excellent catering on a large scale with something to please everyone. How anyone…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,4,Very nice,"We stayed at the Iberostar Founty beach Agadir at the end of November. The hotel is of a very good standard. Rooms are clean, tidy and spacious, with a large bathroom and balcony. The pools are again of good standard one heated and one not. The not heated pool is freezing so be aware. The restaurants serve an excellent variety of food, well prepared and very palatable however they are not always clearly marked as to what they are. The bars are probably the weakest part of the hotel, the staff are incredibly helpful and pleasant but the drinks they supply are hit and miss. The staff around the hotel are excellent. Outside the hotel, the promenade leading to the marina is a hive of activity and quite open and safe. All in all I liked this hotel and would consider a return…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

It was not busy reception asked to fill Registration card to move to a different small area section separately that felt not welcome 😔 that cause distance to us, i will understand if it was busy but ut was not. it was my daughter 3rd birthday so they did not get opportunity to interact with us. We felt it was wrong choice of hotel .

Entertainment team were great, but also left you alone if you did not want to join in. Different food menu to suit everyone. Best to go full board as restaurants are not nearby.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,5,Perfect for what we wanted,"We both have busy schedules in December so wanted a week away with no expectation to do absolutely anything at all, and we did exactly that. The sun is warm enough to sunbathe from about 11am, a large pool area so plenty of space. The heated pool is a bonus this time of year. The beach is a nice walk of a morning Food is good, the donut bread is wonderful. The snack bar is open most of the day for refreshments. Daily activities around the pool - the ibrerostar song & dance, 3pm daily! Jo tried his best to get us involved, fun and not too pushy! He’s an asset to this hotel. Tips: bring a bit of cash, not everywhere accepts card and cash deposits needed for towels and iron etc at the hotel. The TVs have Netflix. Wifi is strong and throughout the hotel. Service is also…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,5,Comfortable and relaxing,"From the moment we stepped into the hotel, the staff could not do enough for you. Always attentive and always polite, they really do make you welcome. The room was comfortable with two large single beds pushed together. There was a balcony with chairs and a table overlooking the pool. There was a fridge and TV but don't expect to watch too much tv unless you are multi-lingual. The bathroom was spacious with a great shower (no bath which was fine by me) and a hair dryer supplied (unneeded by me!). There was also two chairs and a table and a large sofa to lounge around on. To be fair, the room was great but we only spent time there either changing clothes or sleeping. The poolside was great. A heated pool, a 'natural' temp pool and a smaller child pool. The heated pool was deep.…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 November 2022,4,Thank you Iberostar for a fabulous week in the sun ☀️,"We have had a great week in Agadir, first time and would definitely come back for winter sun. Late November stay and the weather has been stunning. A cardigan is needed in the evening but full on beach/pool daytime weather without it being stifling hot. Perfect! The hotel is immaculately clean in all areas and house keeping is excellent. All staff friendly and polite. We were given a room with no balcony but they quickly changed it with no problem when we said we really would prefer a balcony. The pool area is fab and so is the private beach just outside the gate. One of the pools is heated. Wi-Fi good, dropped out from time to time but wasn’t a problem. Food was good - always something to eat as the choice is vast… a bit same same after a week but that’s generally…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2022,3,A good hotel for the price. Staff are great!!,"Just had a week in the hotel, All Inc and was pleased with what we got for the price. All of the staff right through the hotel are very polite, friendly and helpful. The facilities are good and the pools are pleasant, one warm and one cooler. Food is always available and on the whole decent. I would add that some of the food does go cold when it's left standing in the service areas. A few downsides to the stay were the rooms are rather noisy and you can hear all sorts of goings on in the mornings. People walking and talking, cleaners and maintenance, neighbours above and to the sides. We also had no safe in the room. I did ask at reception and was told it was taken out for maintenance and would be replaced the following day, this didn't occur. The entertainment is very…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

The hotel was spotless and rooms were very well cleaned!! Fresh towels, shower gel, conditioner, shampoo and body cream was also available in the shower in the hotel rooms. Honestly we had a peaceful stay we didn’t have the children with us, the hotel had a lovely feel, there were a lot of older couples and a few children but it was lovely.

 November 2022,3,Staying now but let down by service.,Such a beautiful place but despite being advertised as having air-con we have been told it’s switched off for the winter. Our room is extremely hot and we struggled to sleep last night and asked for a fan. 6 people all said they would help and get something sorted but nothing.

 October 2022,5,Excellent Hotel,This was our first time in Morocco and our first time ever going all inclusive. We have been doing the French mobile home camping thing with our daughter for the last eighteen years or so and we are pretty independent travellers and are used to pleasing ourselves. We were quite dubious about what to expect and hoped that as long as the wine and beer were decent and you could find the odd dish to enjoy then it was a bonus given how cheap our trip was. The rooms were not ready and we were invited onto the terrace with a lovely view to enjoy a drink while we waited. A waiter appeared from nowhere and asked if madam would like a cocktail with the biggest smile and welcome. Great start to the holiday. When the rooms were ready we were happy with the accommodation. Pretty standard…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

My husband will eat anything & he along with myself have resorted to pizza more often than not to accompany a salad for most meals. Breakfast is okay omelette stations etc. This hotel is 100% not suitable for UK travellers. Food is the main concern though some of the staff are the rudest I’ve come across to date on my travels.

I paid extra to have a Seaview and it was definitely worth it as it views the pool as well and makes the balcony a really nice area, toiletries provided but the hair conditioner was useless, beds comfy and room kept very clean with lots of storage space Food was great, lots of variety.

 October 2022,5,Love it!!,Spent 7 nights in an all inclusive holiday. Absolutely lovely time all staff are very friendly and helpful My only negative was we had twin beds instead of double so everytime we lay in bed it would move and seperate. My daughter loved the kids camp and the beach is literally at the doorstep The drinks were unlimited and they even gave mineral bottles to take away. The buffet was lovely but does get a bit boring as it is pretty much the same all 3 times. The night time entertainment is nice however maybe could look to do more during earlier afternoon for families with very small children.,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

I think there's literally about an hour in the day where there's no food available. With the 2 restaurants and the pool bar which does food you won't go hungry.

 October 2022,4,Fab week away,"Just returned from a week at the Founty beach hotel. The hotel is immaculate- grounds are beautiful- very well kept and it’s very clean every where. The food is really good - lovely choice in the main buffet restaurant- always something for everyone. Only criticism is the drinks machines were sometimes a bit hit and miss, also it’s a bit of a free for all to sit down - finding a table set at peak times could be a challenge. The pool bar had a good selection at lunch and my daughter especially liked 4pm donuts and pancakes/pizza time. The rooms were clean and spacious- plenty of space for all your stuff. Only criticism is the hairdryer- it’s situated in the bathroom - which is a pain when everyone is trying to get ready and it’s one of those you have to keep your thumb on -…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2022,3,Pretty resort but it’s a circus,"It’s a lovely resort. Large rooms w beachy decor, nice patio off the lobby overlooking the pool and ocean. But Omg the people. It’s just too crowded and loud. The pool area is insane. People dancing, playing Marco Polo, etc. Check in was a zoo. I’ve never had someone demand a hard copy of my booking. When I was unable to email it to the desk clerk (bc their wifi is lousy) she finally agreed to take a photo of it from my phone. We were told to leave our luggage among a sea of bags in the lobby. No tags. Anyone could have come and claimed our bags were theirs and the guy would have never known. We arrived at 230 and the room wasn’t ready. I asked for a beach towel and was told I’d have to wait till 3 bc the towel dispensing was “closed” till then. Most nice resorts have towels…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

A large room with a fridge and safe. (extra cost for the safe) Water provided every day. Walk in shower and towels provided. T.V. with many English channels, and WiFi in our room. Several sanitation points all around the hotel. The food was simply outstanding. Breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant was varied and plentiful.

 October 2022,4,Holiday in agidir,"Iberstar Founty Beach Hotel, my neice and I spent a week at the above hotel. First impressions were good with a lovely reception we were given a huge room facing the pool and partial sea view. The buffet was OK. Good fish and a reasonable choice of food . Although feels repetitive after a while . The Moroccan restaurant was quite nice and it was good to served by friendly staff. The pool was freezing cold , too cold for me to use. Although it was clean and well maintained as were the gardens which were a credit to the gardeners. Shortages of drinks was an on going problem ie diet coke ,rum, proseco not being available all too often. Being charged a deposit for a kettle was around £20 this felt excessive.

I love the Moroccan mint tea. We’d a great sea view room and hotel in general is very clean and staff are very friendly and helpful. Less than a minute walk to the beach with a lovely promenade walk to shops. The evening atmosphere at the hotel was so lively with friendly visitors n live music, etc. In contrast, We didn’t want to come home after a week stay. Definitely go back there again next year. I hope that the management of this hotel will maintain their services like what they do now, it’s a spot on, We love this hotel and met many repeated visitors, they spoke highly about this hotel.

 October 2022,4,Very nice resort,"The pool is super nice, had a very relaxing time. Surf rental is just a few minutes walk away. Overall raspy enjoyed our stay! Food was great, but a little repetitive for vegetarian options. Would be great to see more vegetarian mains, such as protein burgers, soy mince lasagne, etc. Maybe even combine that with Moroccan cuisine. Oberall we were pleasantly surprised by the amount of vegetarian options though! Entertainment in the evening could be better, there is not much to do. And aqua jogging would be great to add!",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2022,3,Pleasant stay spoiled by money stolen by housekeeping staff. BEWARE.,Location is great - very close to the beach. All facilities spotless clean. Food as in all inclusive hotel - you can always find something to your taste. All fresh and looks good. Animation teams are a gem! Great animation for the children - our daughter couldn't wait every night for mini disco. Bar and restaurant staff were great. Friendly and very responsive to any need. On the downside - we had a money stolen from our room twice. It was gone always after housekeeping staff visit. Reception member has been informed but did nothing about it - at least we were not informed about any results of any investigation. We were also not happy with housekeeping service. Room was cleaned properly only once at the beginning and then only towels were changed and beds were done but not…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

This was very welcome after a long day travelling. The reception staff were quick and professional. This hotel is one of the best my husband and I have stayed in. It's so clean everywhere and the position right on the beach is fabulous. The room was basic (3245) but had enough storage and plenty of space. The shower was a walk in and was always hot and powerful. The toiletries were of good quality and smelt lovely. We could see the beach and hear the waves when our balcony door was open. The housekeeping was done every day and the room was kept spotless. Thank you. We had a safe in our room which we used. We took our own kettle and some coffee & milk…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

I will come back again but maybe for a shorter stay now I know the place . DCB",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2022,4,Pretty decent all inclusive,"To caveat this review, we are not seasoned all inclusive-goers so not much to compare to. We wanted an easy, relaxed holiday somewhere hot in October. Founty Beach was great overall. • Friendly staff everywhere all the time, cleaning and asking if you're OK. The pools were lovely. • The food was pretty decent. As vegetarians, it was better than we expected. There was always salad, pizza, pasta, chips, potatoes, vegetables, rice/couscous, cheese, bread and a few other bits and pieces. If you eat meat and fish then there was loads of variety; I saw steak night and sushi night for eg. There weren't many times in the day when you couldn't get food. The best bit was the fresh pancakes and donuts at 4pm by the pool 😊 The only thing we would have liked is better labeling, and not…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

All staff: super friendly, speaking a multitude of languages, inviting you to participate to activities, not being too pushy at the same time. Always eager to help. When I say all staff, means ALL. From the barman to the waiter, the people cleaning the tables (which seem to have eagle eyes as they were there to help anytime you want another fork, or another napkin etc).

 September 2022,5,Faultless,"I went to Founty Beach on my first holiday with my partner, it was faultless. Of course there were one or two encounters with a staff member that wasn’t as pleasant as the rest, but you’ll get that wherever you go. For the things that matter, it was perfect. The first thing to mention is how absolutely spotless the entire resort was. There were staff members specifically dedicated to keep various sections clean e.g. there was a young man by the toilets near the pool, so if you went in wet from the pool, he immediately mopped it up behind you and made sure they were always kept to high standard. This is echoed to mealtime, with staff there ready to wipe up any tiny drop of food that may have been split whilst playing around the buffet area. The rooms were always impeccably…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

The only thing that upset me was how the staff from the animation team and bar staff were mistreated by the manager. It was uncalled for and unnecessary. I have since heard that a few of the animation team have been let go and they were one of the main reasons for returning to this hotel in December, so less inclined to rebook.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 October 2022,4,"Great, but could do with a couple of changes","Very very clean hotel staff pleasant, dining room absolute nightmare, food was nice but, be so much better if a staff member allocated you a table save you walking around with food trying to find a table, they do work very hard, but if there is one thing to improve on its the dining room, it felt more like a work cafe, and we visited the Moroccan restaurant, absolutely bloody dreadful, food was disgusting, we sat in there and there must have been 30-40 people, we didn’t witness any of the meals being eaten, most people complaining, thank goodness we didn’t have to pay for it, we just came out and went to the main dining area, pools are just freezing probably very nice in high season, over all a nice break, thank you",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

The beach is gorgeous but you do get a whiff of camel poop every now & then, I don’t like seeing animals used for human entertainment but the camels here seemed well looked after and not unhappy, the pool is large and although a little cold it’s ok once you’re brave enough to get in.

 September 2022,5,Relaxing as hoped,"This hotel is a little out of the city, right by the sand and sea with a wise and clean promenade that goes all the way to the cafe’s and restaurants further down the sea front, the walk will take around 60 mins or around 20dhs . The beach is lovely fine golden sand , the sea can be rough but is well staffed with life guards. The hotel is very clean and the rooms a good size. Plenty of sun loungers at this time of year, and if you could not find on a life guard will get you them, there are two pools and a small one for smaller children, I would say you pretty much need to be six foot tall to touch the bottom just about anywhere in both pools so beware, day time entertainment is the normal darts,table tennis,dancing the same as most all inclusive hotels, Food in the main…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 September 2022,3,Not Amazing but Not Terrible,"The hotel itself is very nice, majority of the staff are very welcoming and the animation team are very good but can be a little too demanding when it comes them asking you to take part in activities. I understand it’s their job but I’m there to relax and not play darts, they get a little frustrated and won’t take no for an answer sometimes. The rooms are very spacious, beds aren’t terrible and the toilets/shower room is good. You just have to hope for a good balcony view, as our room was said to be a ‘beach view’ when it was just a view of an abandoned hotel to the left of the resort.

The food isn’t terrible but that is a word of…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 September 2022,4,Golf break with a small society,"This is a massive hotel right on the beach front and is obviously popular with locals and tourists alike. Bedrooms are large and comfortable and ""all exclusive"" food is of good quality but the bar service needs to be improved because the wait to be served during the evening is not the best. The food served, whilst in good supply is very sameie - things are repeated each night but for a short stay is OK. The big problem we had was the noise from the bar and entertainment area late into the night. If you are placed in the bedrooms facing the swimming pools be prepared for music and loud noises from the quests well into the night. The free drinks probably had something to do with this. Staff very efficient and pleasant and worked hard to make the stay enjoyable.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

I’d personally rate this as a 3 star hotel. Location of room was nice ground floor pool view 3032. Room very dated and very basic. No kettle and only water in room which was never re filled. Had to ask 4 times to have shower gel and hand wash to be re filled. Safe was £30 a week which we didn’t use. 3rd bed was a so called sofa bed which was old and uncomfortable. We did mention this but nothing was done about it. Ants in room which were cleared etc. bathroom very outdated when showering floor got very very wet.

There is also a small area near the beach where you can pour it yourself , but they have a bar near it in case you want cocktails or a snack. The food is made after a traditional french and marrocan cuisine , so the standard is really high, diverse and delicious. Cleaning service is done daily and the hotel security is great .

The lobby, seating areas and those near the pool were also very well laid out / designed and very comfortable. The food in the all inclusive hotel was excellent for us vegetarians. Food was available all the time together with alcohol. There was an evening dance how every day. There was a concrete path between the beach and the end of the hotel, which was good for walks.

I understand you want to get people involved but I was told I was on my phone too much and I was lazy, I understand it was a joke but after been told it 3 times in a week it starts to get on your nerves. I wanted a relaxing holiday, which it was but felt like I was constantly fighting off entertainers to get me involved.

The pool area is massive and lots of activities for adults and kids to get involved in (water sports, aqua aerobics, archery.. etc). Always sun loungers free and a pool bar with seating. There is also a fenced off private beach area with sun loungers for the guests to use free of charge.

The customer service is just none existent no one at reception that I came in contact with was helpful, they don’t even say good morning let alone any sort of great customer service that I read on here. With coming in contact with the hotel manager I see why. Maybe because I was women he literally talked down to me making me feel like my family being sick in the hotel was invalid.

 September 2022,4,Clean and tidy but changes are needed to make this hotel a decent 4 star resort.,"The hotel itself is perfectly located on the front looking over the beautiful beach and occasional wild sea . The afternoon staff at the main bar are very attentive , they really looked after us especially Nourdine he was a legend, unfortunately the evening staff just did not show his enthusiasm. The food was plain, luke warm and not very tasty but fed us for our 10 night stay . Drinks were cheap but if you drink enough you will get a bad head in the morning. The upstairs area is way to small to accommodate the guests and the entertainment downstairs is of poor quality but nowhere as bad as the bloke in the hat who pretends to play guitar while murdering every song , the animation team try to get guests involved but this artist is the worst I've seen .

Everything was great, location, hotel, service, food, drinks and especially staff. We can't mention everyone as far too many, and many behind the scenes that we didn't even see, that keep this hotel to the standard it is. It's a testament to the hotel and the staff that this resort has a family run vibe. We don't do resorts and were pleasantly surprised and would definitely go back and check out other Iberostar resorts. It was relaxed and chilled vibe, but also activities if you want to join in (which we would recommend) as the animation team are great, day and night. The rooms were cleaned daily and the staff were so attentive to our routine and never disturbed us. I love that this resort has…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 September 2022,4,"First Visit to Agadir/Morocco, UK Young Couple, September 2022","Wonderful hotel worthy of a solid 4-4.5 out of 5* review! First time in Agadir and wasn't sure what to expect so for peace of mind we opted for the #1 hotel on Tripadvisor, Iberostar Founty Beach. From the moment we arrived, we were well taken care of by the reception staff and offered a mint tea upon arrival. First impressions are everything and you can tell they take cleanliness and organisation seriously - everything was spotless and 'in place'. It took us around 10-15 mins to locate our room - the room number signage in the lobby is not the most intuitive but we got there in the end. Room was lovely - spacious and clean with a gorgeous balcony overlooking the pool in the foreground and beach/sea in the distance. The sun sets right over the ocean so we had a lovely balcony…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 September 2022,3,Lovely location by the beach.,"Unfortunately, ‘unattached’ female was harassed by 2 Activities male staff constantly, resulting in us avoiding them and the entertainment. Take euros with you- widely accepted everywhere. To buy dirhams in the hotel, you need actual cash. There is an ATM 2 hotels along at a Rui. French is widely spoken. Taxi to the huge Souk is 40 dirhams, 10 mins away, and worth a visit. Walk along the esplanade to gift shops and restaurants on way to the marina. Camel rides on the beach are good fun. Negotiate a price for 10 minutes. Look for Christophe (who likes to eat apples) the camel, and his lovely handler called Anas.

The staff at this hotel allow it to boast a five star experience. So for individual excellence I would highlight Khalid on the animation team his is the most genuinely humanistic caring individuals who makes the guests to feel their passion for feeling the most positive of life’s emotions, thankyou for the fantastic experiences over our ten days stay. the food in the main restaurant delivers a mesmerising choice which is exemplary in its overall quality, The rooms are vast and spacious with comfortable beds and furnishings together with a lovely shower. massive thankyou to all of the staff",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 August 2022,5,"Iberoatar Founty Beach Agadir, Morocco",Very nice hotel/resort. Very clean and well staffed. Loved the all inclusive basis for food and drinks. Plenty of sun loungers and never had an issue finding a good spot. Excellent for families with children with good activities and events everyday. Only average comment is the food was a bit samey and didn't change too much but plenty of it. We did venture out of the resort once but a lack of shops and restaurants close by was disappointing but nothing to do with the hotel. Overall very good and would recommend going there.,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 August 2022,4,Well kept resort hotel on the beach,"Stayed for a week in August and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Mostly positive aspects which are: Cleanliness - Everywhere is spotless and the grounds are immaculate. The staff work really hard to keep standards very high General design of hotel - Really lovely foyer, terrace and general layout. Food - As a lot of other people have said the variety and quality of the food is excellent. Every meal time there is plenty of choice. Sure after a week it does get a little repetitive but there will always be something you haven't tried before. Staff - Every member of staff were polite, professional and helpful. Room - Comfortable beds, spacious, good size, decent bathrooms and balcony large and with a great view of the beach and pool.

 April 2022,5,Fantastic Hotel in a great location!,"This is a fantastic hotel, we had a family room which was a large room with a double bed and 2 single beds pushed together and a sliding door separating the room. It was cleaned every day. The hotel was very clean and when we walked out to our room it was wow what a view! The beach is just a 1 minute walk. The food was very good, fresh food cooked every day with plenty of choice. Fresh dishes cooked in front of you. Plenty of delicious sweets. The hotel is all inclusive, the drinks were OK, not the best wine or selection of cocktails. Plenty of activities going on throughout the day, archery, darts, aqua aerobics, water polo. The entertainment staff were very good, not too pushy. Entertainment on the night was not the best but watchable. We went mid April we could not…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 August 2022,4,Brilliant resort,"11 of us as family members with 4 children had a wonderful time at Founty Beach. The food and service were fantastic along with really friendly staff. Only minus point was the pool towels. £10each but payable only in Durham, so we had to change £110 into Durham before we got the tokens! When we checked out we got back £110 in Durham with nowhere to spend them as only small site shop. So we had to change them back at airport (hotel wouldn't change them and can't take them out of country! Instead of 12.7 to the £ we only got back around 7.5 !! Come on Iberostar allow us to pay in £s and get £s back. Rip off! Food was unbelievable but please add a curry to the options.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 August 2022,4,"Great hotel, lots of crying kids!","I will start with the pros: amazing food and service. I don’t think you can have a four star resort that can deliver delicious and fresh food at this level. Besides local flavours and dishes, the selection was always so diverse and never repetitive. Staff are extremely helpful and there is always mint tea at the reception. While the rooms could do with a bit of a face lift, nothing really stands out badly, it’s just a classic resort. Now, we visited this resort as a couple without kids and while we were aware that this was a family oriented resort, at times it really gets to you when you are on the beach and 2 young kids cry endlessly behind you. My advice to the management is to create some “quiet” zones, perhaps a section of the beach, especially for those who may be…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 July 2022,3,Good hotel but cold pools and lack of entertainment,"Firstly I booked this directly and got a great price for two interconnecting room so thank you to the r Central Reservation Team. The hotel is a bit far out, 20 mins walk to the centre. Lots of taxis available outside and always reasonably priced. The indoor pool was freezing and therefore the outdoor pool was a bit warmer (only just). It was a bit cold until the late afternoon when the sun came out. The food is really good. We preferred the lunch service when compared to the dinner. They had more option during lunch especially for dessert. The biggest downfall for me was the lack of entertainment for adults. They had a musician every night but it wasn’t very interactive. We had an issue with a cleaner just barging in my daughters room. Firstly they knocked really loudly for…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

I would like to specifically mention ( but this is embarrassing as I can’t totally remember his name!) Nourhono (?) the barman who makes the best hot chocolate in the world and I had one each morning! The hotel has lovely pools, and easy access to the sandy beach.

 August 2022,4,"Some good, some bad but mostly GOOD",I have recently restarted from the hotel After a great 10 days holiday. Reading the reviews before I left I was expecting some negatives but found them to be very small. So I’ll start with the negatives. The weather - misty most morning but burnt off by 3pm. It is warm but not hot and can get chilly By the pool especially after getting out. The pool - absolutely freezing! They must pump it in from the arctic! When the sun isn’t out it’s not really a pleasant experience. The Wi-Fi - now I’m just being picky but it can be difficult to get any internet and it does drop frequently Drinks - the evening pool side bar could do with a bigger range. The hotel design - all rooms are based around a small indoor square shared with about 10 rooms per floor and 3 floors. The problem is…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 August 2022,3,Family holiday in a quite basic hotel,"Family holiday with 2 young boys. The hotel was full but didn't feel overcrowded. There wasn't much in the way of entertainment for the kids, the kids club was mainly for French speaking locals and tourists. The pool was too deep. The room was incredibly sparsely fitted out consisting of two beds a couple of chairs and not much else. The buffet restaurant was good although my vegetarian wife struggled.

 August 2022,4,Not bad at all :),"We like the Iberostar Founty beach, would we return? probably not, would we recommend it? Yes I think so. It’s a beautiful hotel, pretty big too. We prefer smaller hotels which is why we probably wouldn’t return to this hotel, but would return to Agadir. The hotel is very clean, the maids so a great job in the room and the hotel staff so a great job in the grounds, problems are sorted promptly by the care takers, we had an issue with our safe which was fixed immediately. The safe in the room IS NOT FREE a day rate must be paid 30 dirhams a day, it isn’t a lot, but I don’t agree or know why some hotels charge for use of the safe, this is second time we’ve had to pay for a safe.

 August 2022,4,A fantastic all inclusive family holiday,"An excellent 4 star hotel sited right on the beachfront of Agadir. Having walked along the beachfront and seeing most of the hotels, it looks like the best hotel in the area. What makes this hotel so good is the staff. They really are excellent and would do anything for its guests. You literally put your plate or drink down and they clear it away. In terms of the food, there was plenty of choice for everybody. There was the main restaurant, a poolside snack bar and a sit down restaurant with table service. The bars scattered around the place all had brilliant, happy bar staff who happily served you any drink you wanted. The rooms were nice and comfortable, without being particularly luxurious.

On the positive side, this hotel is really nicely set up with a really lovely pool area and easy access to the beach, which is amazing. The staff is very welcoming and warm, and it’s very family friendly with lots of entertainment for kids. The main issue we struggled with was the hotel being incredibly overcrowded. I waited 20 minutes to pay the additional hotel taxes during check-in. It took another 20 mins to get pool towels when we first arrived. Maybe I just got unlucky because the lines seemed better on other days. However, mealtimes were consistently stressful and overcrowded. You’re literally bumping into people with every step you take.

No problems with sunbeds on the beach or by the pool. Nice, large rooms, cleaned every day. The food and drinks are tasty and varied. Unfortunately, one incident changed my good opinion. Two days before my departure, I realized that I did not have a wedding ring that I had left in a drawer in my room. I informed the reception about this - 2 ladies were sent to the room who searched the room and did not find a wedding ring. And then the reaction of the hotel ended. After a few hours, I went back to the reception. Initially, I talked to a PR specialist who did not know what to do, I asked to call the police, but he could not get through.

Food was in 2 locations the main restaurant and pool side bar, both were equally as good as each other. was nice to have a lazy morning then go to the poolside bar for breakfast after 10am. Restaurant food had something for everyone, a little busy at times but nothing more than what you would expect and everything was constantly topped up. Room was nice and clean as well as the hotel. Staff were lovely and helpful at all times. Beach was just outside the boundary wall which was nice and clean.

Prior to booking I emailed the hotel twice to see if they had any adjoining rooms, my kids are 20 and 13 and like their own space. I never received a response to either of my emails but I went ahead anyway and booked a ‘family room’ as I was desperate to book somewhere and the reviews for this hotel looked good. Check-in was good, the staff were very friendly and welcoming. What would have been a nice touch though was a welcome drink as it was 38 degrees when we arrived at 8pm.

Our room was basic enough but perfect for what we needed and plenty of space for us and three kids (4, 6 and 9) and the common areas and grounds were very well kept. The food was well beyond what we would have expected for the price (and what we have experienced elsewhere for more) and we didn’t tire of it in the 10d. Drinks were very good too. The only slight fault I’d have was the lack of availability of ice cream for kids outside of meal times. There’s nothing much around the hotel but this time we were just looking for pool/beach relaxation so it was fine for us but wouldn’t have worked for us on other holidays. Would also have been a struggle if the food…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 July 2022,5,Excellent beachfront hotel,"The hotel lobby is very welcoming. The staff was helpful as we didn't speak French or Arabic. The grounds were well kept and the pool was refreshing. We visited the beach every day and this was fun too. The soccer court and ping pong tables were also a nice touch. Food was good. We tried the tangine restaurant and really enjoyed it. Our room was spacious and nice. Beds were comfortable. We used the kids club one day and that was a nice break. We visited crocopark and did dune buggy tours on sand. Recommend both. Only negatives, (and these may be cultural differences) the music was played past 11 most nights. For us, it was a bit loud, but im sure others liked it. The other is that some parents would not supervise their kids for hours on end. There were signs at the pool…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 June 2022,5,Fantastic Holiday,"My wife and I spent 5 days at this Hotel and I have nothing negative to say. The entrance was grand and clean and the welcome from the staff was great. Check in was smooth. Only issue I had was the safe in the room was faulty but this was resolved within 10 minutes. We had a Sea View room which was huge, brilliant to start and end the day overlooking the beach and listening to the waves breaking. In addition it was far enough away from the entertainment to not be disturbed. The room was clean and was maintained every day with fresh towels and a friendly face. Loads of choice on food if you are not fussy and are keen to try out new flavours and cuisine. The staff were attentive and we never struggled to find something to eat. All inclusive drinks were fantastic - made even…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

They always check up on you to see how your doing and if you need anything. Shoutout to all the boys but specifically Jo & Othmane. JO / Jawad really did go over and beyond for us. His yoga, aqua gym and Zumba classes were the best out of all the programs. He puts 100% effort and passion in and it shows because his classes are usually the busiest and the best. I also got sick on our trip and he and othmane both made sure to check if I needed anything. I mean getting sick abroad is the worst thing but their compassion went a long way and was very much appreciated. Othmane is always full of energy and good vibes!

 June 2022,2,Mrs,"Just arrived at Iberostar Founty beach.We went to a few in different countries previously. What a disappointment, already changed two rooms number 1023 and 1031, infested with ants .. Four star hotel nowadays with ants , not on whatsoever. Also rooms look very dated with old rusty bins.. Very upsetting spending ages trying to get into decent room and a Manager at reception wasn’t even bothered that much to apologise. Apparently it’s common and normal to have ants in the room.. Well I am hoping the rest of our holidays will be more positive and exciting like we were expecting it to be..",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 June 2022,5,Jacek,"In my opinion, the hotel is very nice. About 4 km from the center, which allows you to experience the charm of Morocco. In the hotel, the rooms may leave a bit to be desired, BUT I rate the dining of the swimming pools as a very big plus. Food, there is something for everyone; breakfast I recommend omelettes only from LEILA (best regards), delicious for me, nothing more. Animation on a very nice level, I was with my family; children 13 and 17 years old practicing sports, I recommend. In our opinion, we should especially appreciate Mustafe 👍 and Jo👍. They made sure that people would not get bored - we greet them and thanks to them we hope that we will return to Morocco one day.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 June 2022,4,"Hotel spot, spa terrible","Stayed here before in 2016 and was impressed so came back. From receiving a nice mocktail at check in which was swift, we were shown to our fresh clean rooms. The hotel is calm and relaxing with a good selection of food and different specials on certain days. All good so far so why 4 stars??? Well the Spa which is privately run however is part of the hotel has knocked 1 star off. We booked a full service (hamam, massage, deep tissue massage, sauna and jacuzzi) We booked it in 2 sessions as they couldn't fit us all in which was fine. The second session they told us 4pm before the day of leaving so we turned up and they said it was 2pm. So rebooked for the day of leaving at 9.30am.

My daughter loved the animation team, special shout out to Taoufiek (TA), Oumeima, Mustapha and Ali, he was hilarious. The dancers were good but never spoke to anyone they thought they were better than everyone else but were good when on the stage, good entertainment they just need to change their attitudes. Lovely hotel overall and all the bar men got to know me and knew my drink and had it ready every time and that was at all the bars. Mustapha and his team at the snack bar were great to. All the staff work very hard and a few tips now and again is well deserved as I discovered and your treatment gets better the more you…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Overall the hotel was great - amazing location, great facilities, great for all inclusive in terms of food, drink, snacks and variety. Rooms were spacious, clean and a special shout out to the evening entertainment which was outstanding and a great way to end the evening. As a family of four, the hotel is ideal given it’s away from the nightclubs and “noise” at the night from other hotels and bars into the Agadir city centre. The beach location is also great as you have a private section and are away from the crowded section. The lifeguards both on the beach and in the hotel pool were very good - friendly and vigilant at all times (the sea in particular can be quite choppy). Bar staff were also very friendly and always served us with…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 May 2022,4,Mostly good,"Well i have just recently arrived from my seven night stay in agadir at iberostar founty brach. Overall this was a good hotel with good service and we were happy for the most part. There are some improvements and cons that cannot go unnoticed. The place itself was lovely and clean, the pool area was superb and the beach bit was also good enough. Hammam and massage was decent. My mother needed a room on ground level as she didn't want to do too much walking and after the first night the lovely lady kalsoom sorted this out for us. Food was good but there could have been more variety, got bored after day 4. The entertainment isn't up my Street but it i can appreciate how good it was.

Entertainment: The boys on the animation team worked so hard all day long, around the pool, playing the games, doing the sport events and dancing with guests on the terrace in the evenings. Brilliant. Where they got their energy from we don't know. We did archery, pool Zumba and watched the dancing in the entertainment lounge most evenings.

In the past I felt that hotel meets what I expect 4* Iberostar to be, but last visit made me change my opinion. Starting from the check in process - when I asked for the room facing the pool, get a room facing the fence, moreover super far from reception to go back and complain. Apart from the fact that being Infinity client, I expect some of the requests to be accommodated, what I also expect in every hotel, regardless of my loyalty status, is to be told upfront if for whatever reason this is not the case, not dragging my feet to the end of the hotel to find this out.

 May 2022,1,Horrible Service & Broken AC!,"We checked in today, May 16, and within only a few hours it’s been an extremely sub par experience. We just came from 4 night and 5 days at the Iberostar Marrakech which was a 5 out of 5 in terms of service/staff, property, food. The rooms were updated, staff was amazing, property extremely well maintained etc. We were hoping for the same when we got to Agadir. However, the Iberostar Agadir has been a total bust. Reception staff are not helpful, ACs in rooms are not working, you have to pay 30 MAD/night for the in room safe which is also not working so far, even the phones in the room aren’t working! I’ve travelled a lot and been too many properties and I’m not to one to write a terrible review without merit. What gets me the most is that the staff seem unwilling to help for…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2022,4,Good but not brilliant,"First impressions we were happy with the hotel it was clean and had everything we required. I have listed each item below and given reasons as to positive or negative. Rooms- beds were typical as in 2 singles pushed together. They were comfortable and more than satisfactory. There was a good size wardrobe, fridge, drawers, a sofa and balcony. The bathroom was fine although only had a walk in shower which was more than adequate. There was a safe in the room that was chargeable if you wanted to use it. Food- we found the food to be really quite good. Plenty of choice with freshly cooked stations on every sitting. I had a freshly made omelette each morning. The snack bar serves different things at lunchtime to the main restaurant so worth checking before walking to the restaurant…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2022,5,Best hotel in Agadir!,"In May 2022 we traveled again to Iberostar Founty Beach. I only have positive points for this hotel. The crew at the reception is very polite and helpful. The food is outstanding, everyday there is enough choice and it’s delicious. Also the staff in the restaurant is very good. The animation team did everyday their very best to entertain the guests! Big thumbs up for all of them: Amin, Othman, Sakobi, Najat, Nahela, Younes, Black & Ali! The shows at night became a bit boring after a while because it was every night a danceshow, after talking with some other clients they also agreed to miss to see the animation bringing their own shows. It would be nice to see some change time to time. The parties the hotel used to give in the past should really come back, the White Party…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2022,5,Review of Iberostar Founty Beach & Noureddine Tour Guide,"I stayed at Iberostar Founty Beach in Agadir for 3 days with 14 other friends, We had a wonderful time it was a lovely resort with very friendly staff and amazing facilities. We also enjoyed our travel guide Noureddine. He was very friendly and accommodating, he booked us the best exertions for great prices. He was able to fit as much as we could into one day and was very helpful considering we were such a large group. He answered all our questions and was always available via WhatsApp. I am glad he helped us during our stay because he made our trip 10 times better. Thank you",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 April 2022,5,5* Service in a 4* Hotel,"We visited the Iberostar Founty Beach mid April as a family of 4 including 2 young children. To sum it up we had an amazing vacation in a clean hotel, with great food and amazing staff. What's great Staff - the staff worked really hard and it must of been hard working through Ramadan. Time for some shout outs for a few that really helped make our holiday. Mostafa & Jamel (Pool bar) great guys, were fasting whilst working in 30 degree heat and still had a smile on their faces and made time to get to know the guests. Always remembering my random pineapple, sprite and vodka drink. Were great with my eldest who wanted hot chocolate in the sun for some reason...

 April 2022,5,Wonderful family vacation for a week,"The hotel is absolutely gorgeous. Worth every cent or rappen or penny or whatever money you have. Food was great, staff are polite and friendly. Absolutely recommended. Pool is very handy and it is inside the hotel. One pool is warm so can enjoy in every condition. The only slight negative comment are some sport activities are little bit outdated (only two broken ping pong batters, or old dirty tennis equipment) but that is not affecting your stay that much",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2022,4,Would highly recommend for relaxation,Lovely hotel. Food is impeccable. Best all inclusive food I've had. Freshly made omlettes and grilled chicken breaks and fish fillets. Salad and fruit is as fresh as you could ask for. Hotel is clean and the pool staff couldn't be more helpful. The staff in general are always very helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful and clean. The only downsides I could say is the bar only ever had 2 people on it so the ques could be long and if you don't like rum you wouldn't drink anything other than lager. There was no TV's outside the rooms if you wanted to watch sports and with there being no bars anywhere else within a 5 mile radius you was isolated to the hotel. You do however have TV in your room (Minor things but just wanted to mention). A big mention to Nouredinne Ait Oumrim who…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 April 2022,5,Memorable Family Experience,"Family of 9 adults needing 5 rooms. Forgot to ensure they were together but hotel had already anticipated that. Standards are high but be prepared to wait at reception as that is understaffed and slow. Catering is of a high standard. Rooms were spacious, modern and with full facilities. All rooms seem to be sea facing. Guests were mixed with a good balance of couples and families. No rowdiness! Staff were friendly and attentive. Queues for food and beverages always moved quickly. The 3 swimming pools are extremely clean, of a good size and easily catered for each of toddlers, children and the largest pool, ideal for adults wishing to swim or just to relax and enjoy being in the pool. Great holiday vibe and value.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2022,4,Amazing family friendly hotel,"A lovely family friendly hotel, amazing food at the buffet and location and the star club kept the kids occupied to allow an enjoyable visit for us all. The children’s heated pools also a bonus as was a cooler time of year . The junior suite was spacious and we had a great sea view",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2022,5,Fantastic!,"Went to Founty Beach 05th - 14th April, in search of some spring heat tow adults two children. We were not left disappointed - glorious weather. The hotel itself is not that easy to access from the main road, as a new road is being constructed, limiting being able to exit on foor to the town. I will not go on about how great the hotel is, but will give you some good tips. On booking a room, it appears some rooms show as wifi included and others do not. Fear not, the whole complex is covered by 20mb wifi, enough to make a video call back home, which is just as well as my phone provider charges £6mb!! A useful tip is to download the Iberostar app before leaving home, you can the select Founty Beach and see all that is on offer, including show times and drinks menus...this is…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2022,3,"A great hotel, but single-parent unfriendly","I have complained to Iberostar about this a few times over the years.... I am a single-parent, and my two daughters are 14 and 12. We want a room together, but I would like a Suite, so they can have their own privacy. However, if you book using Iberostar's own website, and say you're just ""1 adult + 2 children"", they *only* show you a selection of the five double rooms available at this hotel. You have to LIE, and say you're two adults, in order to see the Family Rooms or Suites. This is due to Iberostar's ""minimum spend per occupant"" policy, and they are completely unapologetic about it. If you book using a third-party travel website, then, no problem, you can book these rooms.... but it's pretty ridiculous. Oh, Iberostar did suggest I contact their customer support,…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2022,5,Iberostar fantastic,"Amazing hotel, staff were perfect, weather amazing. Food was 10 out of 10. Hotel was clean and tidy and staff very attentive. We went as a family of 4 with the youngest being 12. Best place we have been in Morocco.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 April 2022,3,Lovely hotel but could do better,"Six of us, 5 adults and 1 child, booked a last minute holiday through Love holidays. We arrived at reception after booking a private taxi from the airport and because Love holidays hadn’t sent proof of vouchers it took over two hours for us to complete booking into the hotel, I eventually had to put my phone on charge and retrieve the emails, this was very frustrating especially as the staff, though lovely, spoke limited English. The hotel itself is lovely, the gardens are beautiful and well maintained. The reception area is nicely laid out but is quite dark inside, and because of the time of year, end of March/April it can be quite chilly unless sat in full sun. Some patio heaters would be lovely. Rooms; They are bright and clean with a beautiful mural on the wall, only…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 March 2022,5,Great holiday in Agadir,"Just returned from a lovely week staying at the Iberostar hotel. This was our first time visiting Morocco and we loved every minute of it. We could not fault the hotel at all, the rooms were really big and spacious and were cleaned daily by such a pleasant lady(not sure of her name) who always had a smile on her face and would stop to speak with us and teach us how to say things in moroccan. The grounds of the hotel are well kept and spotlessly clean. The food was really nice in the restaurant and at the pool bar, there was a variety of foods and also pizza and chips etc for the fussy eaters. It was good that although the food was buffet style it was being served to you by the staff due to covid rather than everyone handling it themselves. The animation team worked really…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2021,4,Fab hotel and great value.,"Lovely, well kept grounds, perfectly situated a 2 min walk from the beach. The pools were cold and disappointingly they wouldn't heat them up. A few other guests also asked for them to turned on, but unfortunately our pleas were ignored. We ended up using the pool in the spa. A few other parents had the same idea and bought their kids there to play as the water was much warmer. The food was okay, albeit a bit repetitive. I loved the paella and couldn't get enough. There was something for everyone though - even the fussiest eater will find something to chow down on! My son aged 6 at the time loved the kids club and would eagerly take part in the disco they'd put on for the kids each evening. I had a black soap scrub/massage at the spa - not as good as one I had in Turkey,…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 March 2022,4,Good holiday,This hotel is lovely and clean. Food was great but around day 4 got a bit monotonous. Drinks were fab for adults and kids missed a slush though. Ice cream was not available at the pool bar as described. French seem to favour at the hotel. We found it a bit annoying when locals arrived at the weekend they didn't think they had to queue or wear a mask at dinner. Entertainment could do with more than just a nightly dance maybe mix it up with singing to. Pools were great and no rush for sunbeds. Would return,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2022,5,"LOVED IT - highly recommend, thanks for having us!","I shall begin this review by saying we had a WONDERFUL time at this hotel. Such a wonderful time and any criticism is just me being really really picky. We loved our holiday, thank you so much for having us!! The room Lovely and spacious, clean, bathroom is very pretty with a nice easy to work shower. Very nice balcony to chill out on with large window doors to let in light. Also a very nice big tv to watch movies etc. beds are comfy and there’s lots of room to hand up clothes. Beds are made daily with new towels aswell. my only criticism is it might be nice to have kettles/coffee in the rooms but other than that lovely. Body wash/shower gel etc are also all included in the room which is nice. Activities A large range of activities happened throughout our stay, from pool side…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

I must say that the Hotel followed top class Covid- 19 cleaning and hygiene guidlines and rooms dining areas pool sides were spotless. Food was freshly made plenty , delicious and loved all the variety . Staff was extremely helpful and couldnt do enough . Rooms were big , beds were comfortable and rooms were cleaned everyday and fresh towels if requested . I had to stay an extra week as my husband had an accident and guest Manager Imam was so helpful and kind and without her I would be lost as communication with hospital was such a barrier .

 October 2021,1,Worst hotel/manager in Agadir!,The food was really bad and the hotel was loud and there was fighting. We have stayed in most hotels along the beach as we are regular visitors. The manager was the worst manager/person I have met in the whole of the country (seriously) and we were told by the locals that everyone has a problem with him unless you are French! I wouldn’t stay here again for free it is honestly that bad!!,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2021,4,Relaxing Break,"I visited here in October for a weeks break and it was my first time at this hotel after staying at others in the area previously. The hotel itself is lovely. It’s very clean, the staff are very helpful and friendly, nothing was too much for them. The pools were nice, clean and maintained well. There were plenty of comfortable sunbeds and there is a pool bar/restaurant too. The only downside to this was that the food side of the pool bar wasn’t open until near the end of our stay but when they did open it we enjoyed several meals at the seated area by the pool. The food inside the main restaurant was ok. I felt there wasn’t really enough variety and although I understand the Covid rules in place, being served by the staff meant long queues and lots of waiting around with…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2021,4,Great October sun holiday,"A lovely holiday hotel. all facilities nice and clean. Food was a little bit repetitive but delicious nevertheless. I think there was 40% occupancy at most so that is probably to reduce waste. Iberostar cares about sustainability a lot. You could definitely not go hungry or thirsty during the day as various options were available at all times. Staff at the hotel is super friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Saadia, Ayoub and Abdellah from the bar (apologies if the names are spelt wrong). Entertainment team is very good too. They made sure kids are having fun, took time to meet guests and remembered their names. The whole team needs praise Nahida, Hakim, Toufi are the only names I remember - apologies!

Safe provided and loads of storage. The bed linen was crisp white as was the towels in the ensuite. Toilitories were provided in the ensuite. Breakfast was served in the main restaurant.

This is our first visit since the Covid outbreak and we were uncertain as to how the hotel would be operating. However, it was impeccably clean as always with the staff constantly washing, mopping, etc and keeping the gardens/grounds extremely tidy. The hotel was nowhere near to full capacity but they have used this as an opportunity to do some painting of the outside and general maintenance but this was being carried out with the minimum of disruption to guests. We stayed for 2 weeks and on arrival we were disappointed that the pool snack bar was not open at lunchtime but it did open towards the end of our stay.

Some people say they are short of staff but I saw plenty of staff standing around didn’t even greet us, but only to collect plates. They when I queuing up to wait for my food my drinks are getting cold, anyway all the food are cold.

The rooms are spacious, modern and well equipped. The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and patient.

 July 2021,4,"Good value, but very loud and crowded.","This was a far cry from the high-end quality of the Iberostar hotels we experienced in Madrid and the DR. This hotel featured hundreds of incessantly screaming children; massive quantities of lame food (think supermarket pizzas, fake crabmeat, chocolate fountains); an extremely loud PA with throbbing disco music late into the night; no elevators; staff that doesn't speak English, Spanish or German; and an almost exclusively local clientele. The pools were packed; the beach was dirty. But the rooms were large and clean. Also, be prepared to do a LOT of walking to get to your rooms. Finally, the hotel charged 50 Euros CASH (not dirham) per person to administer the required Covid test for a flight out of the country.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 January 2020,2,Overrated and Pretentious,Our tour group spent the night in this hotel. Of the seven hotels we stayed in this was by far the worst. The check-in process was time consuming. My room was on the second floor. Considering that I have a hip problem I had to take the elevator. Only one was working :( My luggage took forever to arrive which annoyed me because I wanted to get out to take some pictures. That evening I wanted to go up to the Oufella (Citadel) overlooking the city to get some sunset pictures. Again all of the staff was too preoccupied to help - each passing me off to another staff member. Since the sun was setting I finally just went out and flagged a cab. I later found out that I was royally ripped off by the driver I was later told by my tour guide that if a hotel staffer had taken the time to…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2020,5,Good as always,"Been visiting this hotel since 2016. The hotel has always been very good. The rooms are always clean, the food is always good, the staff is very friendly. You always get a coming home feeling when coming back to this hotel because the staff keeps reminding you and treats you very well. The location of the hotel is also very good, next to the beach. If I can give also another advice: Try to do other games with the crazy game, bring some variety. After all, the hotel is good. Keep up the good job!",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 March 2020,5,Fantastic holiday at Iberostar Founty Beach hotel,"I spent an amazing 5 nights at the Iberostar Founty Beach hotel in Agadir the first week of March. I'm feeling extremely lucky that I went on holiday when I did. The hotel surpassed all expectations, all the staff and the hotel were amazing. It was my first experience going on an all inclusive holiday so wasn't quite sure what to expect. The food was amazing, I felt like I was always eating and drinking! There was so much choice and everything was well cooked and fresh. Coronavirus was in its early stages but staff were very careful and alcohol hand gel was available before entering the restaurant. The hotel was modern and spotless while still having character. I paid a little more for a room with a side sea view and had a great view overlooking the pool area and the sea. The…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 March 2020,5,Gorgeous Hotel,"We stayed in a budget room which was still to a high standard. Marble bathroom, lovely living area/bedroom. Balcony with a view of sea and other accommodation. Our bed was two singles pushed together, so complained as I had booked a double room. Reception were excellent and our bed was changed to a double with the hour! Room has fridge, TV, air con and hair dryer in bathroom. Room cleaned on a daily basis, cleaning staff outstanding. No room complaints, it's a little tired in the bathroom, but nicest budget room I've stayed in. Hotel. Again, staff in this hotel are so friendly, helpful and always keen to please. Cheerful bar staff, restaurant staff relentlessly clearing tables with a friendly manner. The entertainment staff are amazing, Hicam, Toffee and Daddy to name a few. Day…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 March 2020,4,Very good hotel,"Stayed 5 nights on a golf tour. The room was huge, clean but very plain. Unfortunately mine looked out on a small grassed area at the back so had no views but was not really a problem. The unheated pool was really refreshing after a full day of golf. Being all inclusive I expected the beer and wine to be a bit rubbish but all the drinks were of acceptable quality. The food was good. The staff were all very helpful. Hoping to go back next year.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 February 2020,5,Liked everything about it,HUGE hotel right on the beach with very large pool(s) area and activities galore. Seemed to be a lot of European families on longer vacations. Very nice large rooms with balconies. Extensive breakfast and dinner buffets. Good for walking along the oceanfront. Clean. Quiet.,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2019,4,This is a very nice resort hotel,"This is an amazing and beautiful resort hotel in all aspects. The campus itself is well landscaped and fully facilitated. It has a direct access to the beach and the well maintained Seafront Promenade. It takes about 15 minutes very pleasant walk to the main commercial area from the hotel. And it feels safe even at night. The rooms are very spacious, and nicely furnished. The included breakfast is nothing less than first class, with lots of food stations with plenty of choices.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,5,Large family hotel on the beach,"This is a great hotel which seemed to cater to European tourist groups. We never saw an American anywhere. Long corridors to many rooms. Rooms comfortable and large, all rooms seemed to have nice balconies overlooking the pool and beach, and balconies large enough to sit outside. Dining room was really huge, modern, and great food designed for everyone. Easy walking to many beachside restaurants.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,4,Good hotel for a relaxing sun holiday,The hotel is located in a nice part of a Founty Beach and is quiet. The gardens and public areas were all kept spotless. There is a lovely pool area with plenty of sun loungers and space and had access to its own beach area. The rooms are very spacious and clean and we had a fabulous view from our balcony of the beach and the pool. There is good quality food and plenty of drinks with a great choice available. The staff were friendly and efficient. There was never a queue for the buffet restaurant. Would recommend for a relaxing and chilled out sun holiday.,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,4,Lovely Hotel,"Had a lovely 7 days at the Iberostar. Amazing entrance as you come in - high ceilings and Moroccan feel. Room mostly clean - beds comfy. First night was very hot (unusually 30degrees!) and then we discovered the air con isn’t on at this time of the year. I requested a fan but seems like they don’t have enough to go around! Further nights we opened the balcony door and it was ok as the nights really cool down. Bathroom has shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. All in refillable wall containers. Hotel is quite environmentally friendly - no straws and glass bottles for water which you can freely get from the bar. Hairdryer in the bathroom and small drying rack on the balcony. Pool area nice. One heated pool and one cold pool. Plenty of sun beds. You need to pay…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,4,"A break away from the british weather, plenty sunshine & great food selection","Nice break away at Founty, didnt realise it was the school week so was a bit busy & noisy for us but it is a resort so still enjoyed our week. The towels left down at the pool in the morning is ridiculous & more like a Benidorm pool, there were 2 towels laid down next to us to claim the loungers when we got there but it was 5 hours before the couple appeared! so most days we just went to the beach as luckily the hotel is in a good location so was a bit quieter down there & more chance of finding loungers. We'd of booked an excursion but the paperwork that came through the door was all in french so we didnt bother as didnt understand it so just got a taxi & did our own thing. The spa was expensive but worth it as we enjoyed our treatments. They wanted cash though rather than card…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,5,A welcome sun break from the English winter!,"We last visited the Iberostar in 2017 and, going back, we wondered if it would be as good as we remembered. Fortunately, our experience this time was if anything, better than before. The hotel had a major renovation in 2018 and we were fortunate enough to be in one of the updated rooms with a super walk-in shower in the bathroom. However, the accommodation is not what sets this Iberostar apart from other sunshine holiday hotels. It is the staff who make the difference here. Firstly, there are so many of them (including the “unsung heroes” like cleaners, laundry and kitchen staff) and they really go out of their way to be friendly and helpful to the guests. Our special thanks go to the reception staff who sorted out our return transfer after our outward taxi had failed to meet us…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,5,A superb family break,Just returned from a half term break at founty beach and was really impressed with the hotel. The all inclusive was superb food was plentiful cooked to a good standard and they mixed the afternoon snacks and evening meals up the kids loved it . The kids club made our kids very welcoming especially as they where having to deal with a whole of nationalities. Nothing seemed too much effort and the place has security so you can relax in the knowledge no one can just wander in and I noticed security where doing there job as a few older children tried to wander out to the beachfront but where stopped from doing this. The evening entertainment was very good and the staff work hard to make sure they keep the whole family entertained. Thumbs up to the cleaners who came in every day…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,5,2 Day Sunshine Break,"My partner and I are on our way home from a wonderful 2 day stay at the Iberostar. Simply put, we could not fault this hotel in any way. The hotel is 20 mins from the airport. Check in was straightforward. The room was well appointed, spacious and clean. The all inclusive food offering all day was exceptional. The pools and gardens were immaculate. All staff were courteous and friendly. Tips: - When leaving the airport, if anyone picks up your case and carries it to the other side of the road (10 paces) it’ll cost you $30 MAD - Taxi to/from the airport (White) $220 MAD - Taxi into Agadir (Orange) $20MAD - Beach is vast and clean, but not for swimming in (certainly not in Feb) We would thoroughly recommend, and will be returning. This is the perfect place to catch some sun,…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,5,Fantastic Holiday,"Amazing hotel, all the staff are fantastic from the cleaners to bar staff and receptionist, the food is unbelievable so much variety and choice, the entertainment team are so friendly always cheery. We booked a 2 hr spa which was awsome. The highlight was the attention to detail on valentines day each room had rose petals on bed and chocolates everywhere was decorated and there was an invitation to a cocktail party with canapés, each table was decorated and set with romantic candles there was a violinest and the food was all themed, we came back saturday and have already rebooked for may this year. An outstanding hotel",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,3,Wifi doesn’t work,"Very nice hotel, but the lousy wifi, which is a necessity in today’s world, turned down the experience. Seagulls in the swimming pool didn’t invite you to swim. Staff was very polite and helpful. Food was also good.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,4,A good hotel with good service,"Our group was 2 adults and one 12 year old and we took all inclusive package. The hotel stuff was very friendly and helpful. We came to hotel early and also wanted to do room upgrade in the hotel. They gave the upgrade for free and even our room wasn’t ready they gave us braclets so we had change to eat lunch and got some drinks. The food was good and they made gluten free pasta, pizza and bread for those who need that. There was a lot of choices in every meal. The pools are okay and a very big plus for that they have heated pool outside! Our room was okay and big enough for three ladies. There is lot of entertainments during the day for example zumba, ping pong, archery, tennis and lot of plays for little ones. They also have entertainment shows in every night, but those wasn’t…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2020,5,Very nice hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was big and clean and plenty of good food. The wine was lovely and my husband liked the beer. What made the holiday for us though were the entertainment staff. They are very persuasive to have you come play games with them but we were so glad we did as we had so much fun. We played the darts games each day, they made it all such fun. Then in the evening they were there getting people up to dance. They are chatty and knew us all by name. Can't commend them enough",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 January 2020,3,Wouldn’t revisit,"A nice hotel but we wouldn’t return or recommend The food was plentiful & excellent quality. Restaurant staff were friendly & helpful apart from the omelette man who never smiled. Bar staff were friendly & served decent alcohol. The room was nice but with a view of the road while better pool view rooms remained empty. There were no tea making facilities in the room but there was fridge? If, like me, you need a coffee first thing you have to go to the restaurant (quite a trek) & by the time you’ve got back to your room with it it’s cold. There’s no public transport & not much to do locally. A lot of people walk up & down the promenade which is nice but not for every day? We got a taxi to the Souk which was fun but the same as you see in any market abroad. The evening…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 January 2020,5,This is our 6th visit to this hotel.....,"So, this is my husband and I's 6th visit to this lovely hotel, which should in itself tell you how good it is. Only got back last night but I feel that I must share with you how fantastic it actually is once again. When I look at some of the negative reviews people leave about this hotel I cannot believe what they expect! We were upgraded to a ocean view room and on arrival we had a bottle of champagne and rose petals on the bed (the beds are actually huge and sooo comfortable). The food is varied and plentiful starting with breakfast in the restaurant, mini breakfast at the pool bar, lunch, pancakes & doughnuts for tea followed by dinner. No matter how fussy an eater you are there is always something you can eat. The breakfasts are amazing & cater for all nationalities and…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2019,3,Expected more from a European hotel chain,"Stayed here alone with my 3 year old. Facilities and hotel site are ok but the customer service is seriously lacking, Was very disappointing for such an expensive European chain of hotels. Asked for a cup of tea to take to my room one evening and whilst the bar staff served me my cup of tea they refused to help me to my room with a pushchair and child in tow. So having to navigate my way back to our room, through doors and corridors, I got back to the hotel room to have only 1/3 of a cup of tea left in the cup. Struggles continued throughout our stay with opening doors, up and down stairs with pushchair, toddler and day bags. Staff just looked on in oblivion. Breakfast - staff again looked on in oblivion. Trying to secure a table, park pushchair and belongings and go to the…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 January 2020,5,Paul Jordan,Can’t praise the staff and service at this hotel enough. Location is superb literally on the beach. Food was excellent. I could go on and on. Only one possible draw back if you had a room above the evening entertainment I can imagine it would be loud.,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2019,4,All Inclusive family friendly and easy,"The resort is small but very nice. The staff go above and beyond to help and entertain guests. They even go around the pool area asking for feedback which is simply unheard of. The all inclusive meals were wonderful, decent variety but we only stayed 4 days so I can see how it can get old if we stayed longer. The location was perfect with access to the beach and promendade. We recommend this resort and would surely come back in the future.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2019,3,5 nights over New Year. Useful as a base for a golf holiday but not a destination hotel,"Room 1161, sea view (worth the extra), a long way from reception. Spacious, clean, quite basic but very comfortable and quiet. Dinner was a buffet in the huge restaurant; generally very good food, especially the Moroccan dishes each night. NYE buffet excellent. The hotel's resident entertainment troupe was enthusiastic but aimed at youngsters and younger adults, not my taste. NYE offered a good singer in the bar and dancing, but no real NYE party atmosphere. Staff friendly and good; most speak at least some English. Easy access to the very long promenade and beautiful beach. Irritatingly the Antares Moroccan restaurant was closed during our stay and the safes in the rooms were programmed not to work (there was a safe in reception, available at 3 euros a day but…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2019,5,superb winter sun break,"I have stayed here 3 times and I'm going back next week. It's not as expensive as many of the very top tier resorts (5* as supposed to 4*), but has many of the same standards. Refurbed I think in 2018. Food is very good, good cocktails (especially with a small tip). Bar staff in particular lovely. poolside bar and food area during day. Great view from terrace, one of 2 pools is heated. Downsides? The concrete walls can make it a bit noisy in the morning with cleaners and the poolside toilets needed looked after a bit better. wifi is a bit patchy. These are small things. Overall, a superb hotel and excellent value. Looking forward to my 4th trip.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 December 2019,5,Amazing place to stay,"Highly recommended. It is my fifth time staying there. Do I need to say more? Agadir is under 4 hours flight, from European countries, which are now paralysed by the cold. I arrived a week ago on 14th December. The flight was on time. The taxi was waiting for me and half an hour later, I was in the hotel. Painless. The weather (24-28) degrees, the rooms, the food and entertainment have been amazing. Above all, the swimming pools (3) are kept clean and safe by 4 very efficient lifeguards. A big THANK YOU guys, for keeping us safe. Every day around 18:30, like Swiss Clock, the sun falls into the sea. Every day. It is mesmerising. People cannot help, but stop and watch. The most beautiful sight. The beach itself, is a sight to see, miles long, clean and yes, oriented West.…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2019,1,Gluten free lie!,"This hotel is not gluten free, you have the possibility to ask for a gluten free menu but is is not right, it is a lie. They need to work on this, this is important for the guests, you are playing with people's heath!",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2019,2,Not for families,"Went to this resort for 2 weeks. The worst resort ever, there was builing work being done under our room so it was amazing being woken up at 8am with loud banging noise. The chicken in the restaurant was always under cooked so if you want food poisoning this is the place. The reception staff are the most rudest and unhelpful staff I have ever met. On the plus side great views and nice entertainment staff. Not one for a family especially if you have kids. This is a no no resort",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing experience starting with the hotel which is very nice, modern and clean, excellent food-everything you want from local food, salads, all types of meat and seafood, soups and main courses, really everything you could possible want and all kind of dessert. Again about the drinks-cocktails, wine at discretion, soft and alcoholic drinks, served by a very friendly staff, not to forget the snack bar which again was amazing. We used the spa too and again all the service was 5 stars from staff to procedures and the animation tea was great. All in once we had a great time and we definitely recommend this hotel to everybody who wants to spend a great time in a splendid and friendly hotel with really good food and drink.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2019,2,Not what we expected,"This was our first time in agadir but we stayed in iberostar in marrakech before and had an amazing experience so we thought iberostar agadir would be similar experience. I will start with negatives and then positives. Negatives We arrived at hotel and was taken to the junior suite, however this was not the room I was promised before making the booking so we had to wait for the room I was promised to be ready before we could actually move into the room this took around an hour or so. When we finally moved into our room we noticed the heating was not working we asked for an engineer to have a look, he had a look and said that the heating had to be prepared but not now as it was late in the night. So we slept in cold room without heating. The engineer came next day after I…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2019,5,"Nice Hotel, impressive from the start","Having visited with my friend and my 3 Yr old son, I was impressed with the service received throughout the hotel from animations team, to caterers to reception, bar etc. The hotel grounds were nice and inviting, nice child's play area towards the back end of the hotel and with us being All inclusive, their was a huge variety of food and drink that you just don't know where to start. Towels were changed every day, cleaners, staff all very friendly. Nice view from outside the main canteen overlooking the poolside and the huge garden. Very peaceful and very family friendly hotel. I would definitely stay here again as everything was spot on. Thankyou",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2019,4,Really Good Hotel,"Lovely beach location. We both had a hammam and massage which was brilliant, just make sure you know what you are getting when you book. Such a shame the indoor pool was only open between 12 and 2. I would have done the aqua-aerobics every day but we were always doing something else at that time. The animation team were great especially Ash and Jo, hope you qualify Ash in animation. One big downside was the deposit on towels and safe. We were promised it back in sterling so had just cashed more money and were left with 500 dirhams. We thought we would spend that on duty free at the airport but found we could only buy moroccan goods. We ended up with very expensive chocolate dates. TIP... if you have any euros do take them as French is more popular than sterling.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 August 2019,5,The hotel is amazing thanks to Rony and Mimo!,"Amazing hotel, very clean, with great selection of food and drink. What makes the hotel truly stand out from others is the staff and the level of customer service! The entertainment team was AMAZING! The guys do their job in the way that you don’t see them working, you think they are your friends and they are chilling with you! Many thanks to RONY and MIMO , who are the real stars of the hotel! ⭐️⭐️They were looking after everybody, making us feel that we are very welcome and appreciated here.

 December 2019,3,Very average not 4 star for sure,The hotel generally have seen the better days. Kids club - the lady runs the kids club doesn’t know what she is doing or the daily program. It was advertised on the screen by the entrance and she can’t be bothered to check it before she rocks up to work. There has not much toys there to entertain kids apart from a TV and a few colouring pencils. No wonder why the kids club is empty. Food - plenty of choices but most of them are quite over cooked. The local food are good though. Basically the food they know how to cook it is good. You will also be expected to eat with the staff at the same time. The reserved restaurant - I wouldn’t bothered to be honest. You only have chicken or beef tagine you can choose from. The starter was two deep fried parcels type things and both dry…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 November 2019,4,A nice resort on the beach,"We only stayed here one night as a part of a tour. I would say this is a nice resort style hotel, right on the beach. The rooms were very large compared to other hotels we stayed at in Morocco. The rooms and grounds were clean and well maintained. We opted to eat at the buffet for dinner and breakfast. There were many options for the dinner dinner. A typical large hotel buffet so the food is pretty standard fare.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2019,3,Spend your time at the pool bar!!,"Had a 6 night stay in this hotel after spending 4 nights in marrakech. Like others there are positives and negatives....

One pool was heated The staff work very hard and were all polite The rooms were large and clean and the shower was great The walk from the front along the beach was nice and took about 40 mins to get to the marina The hairdryer is like trying to dry your hair with a candle...take your own! The buffet restaurant is the same as any large hotel like this and is somewhat of a cattle market but in general there was always something different to try, we did eat out a couple of nights and always ate at the pool bar at lunch The wine is…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2019,4,Nice getaway in the sun,"We stayed for a week and enjoyed our stay. A few negatives: 1. Our checking in at reception felt a little rushed and impersonal. The staff were busy but when we asked about a safe we were told,"" Come back tomorrow"". 2. Main restaurant was like a canteen- very busy, noisy, bright lights and we sometimes struggled to get a free table. Tables are crammed in tight together, obviously to accommodate as many people as possible. A big hotel so I guess that's inevitable. 3. No nice bathroom toiletries - cheap shampoo and soap in dispensers. No hair conditioner, no body cream, no tissues, no magnifying mirror, no robes or slippers. Bring your own! 4. One day we never had clean towels. I'm sure they would have been replaced if we'd complained but we made do. Positives: 1. Lovely sized…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 October 2019,4,Half Term in the Sun - Brilliant Week,"Not been to Morocco before so we were slightly hesitant but as it turns out, without any founding. . .you certainly could be anywhere in the world inside the hotel complex. Just out of the complex was a very well kept promenade which was great for a good walk. We initially got a ""taxi"" from the airport which was an experience in itself. I would advise going for one of the newer option is possible. Ours was a 1980 Mercedes that had no working seatbelts or even a passenger seat that was fixed to the floor !! My 17 year old daughter who has just passed her test was horrified :), especially when the taxi driver turned back to talk to them for about 20 seconds them whilst driving through a busy highway .. . . we all made it safe . . .

 October 2019,5,"Pleasant stay, lovely food, friendly staff, no plastic policy!","I was very surprised and I have to say we had a wonderful time at this hotel. The staff was helpful, animation team skilful and organised, food delicious, pools clean, rooms newly renovated (also clean) and I could go on. What suprised me as well was the ban on single-use plastic, responsible consumption of seafood and changing sheets/towels upon request. Thumbs up! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax by the pool with a good book and a glass of chilled wine (also very good). :)",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 September 2019,5,Great hotel!,This is a great hotel. From the friendly helpful staff through to the fun entertainment team. The hotel is clean and always being cleaned. The food is plentiful and always changing. I must mention the evening entertainment - choose from a themed night or the crooner in the main bar. Either way it’s fun. Highly recommend!,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Our partial sea view room overlooked the pool but we could clearly sea the sea and the beach. Excellent choice of food at both the main buffet and at the beach bar. Variety of fresh meat and fish cooked daily at both, including pork which surprised us. We always had lunch at the beach bar as plenty of choice including freshly cooked pizzas, salads and pasta. The alcohol was all good and you could free pour wine, beer and soft drinks even at the beach bar which…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 October 2019,5,The most enjoyable family holiday!,"I visited Iberostar Founty Beach in October this year with my family of 7 and we all had such an amazing time. The hotel, it’s staff and amenities were great! The food was so tasty and the hotel was so clean, light and had such beautiful architecture. Our room was huge so we had plenty of room to call home for two weeks. I also had a spa treatment (a seaweed wrap) which was luxurious and made my skin feel amazing and my senses revived and refreshed. If you come to Morocco, then please do not miss out on having one of these Hammam treatments - they are so good, some of the best in the world! The location of the hotel was brilliant; set right on the beach which had beautiful golden sands and it’s own private sun lounger area exclusive for Iberostar guests. Only a 10 minute taxi…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2019,4,Great hotel,"Stayed here for a 5 night break, having stayed here 4 years ago we were pleasantly surprised by the improvements made. Hotel facilities are very good food was plentiful. The hotel being on the beach is an added bonus with its long promenade. Entertainment team were polite and enthusiastic-special mention for Simone who was very considerate and kind to our 82 year old mother. Only negatives are poor Wi-Fi in certain areas. Evening entertainment is very poor.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2019,4,Good relaxing stay,Stayed here in October 2019 for one week. The hotel was in a good location on the beachfront. The room was comfortable but the beds were very firm. Our room had a pool view and a slight view of the sea. The balcony was great to sit out on overlooking the grounds/pools. The food was very good however the menu didn’t change much and was very predictable. The spa was very good as was the gym although the gym could do with being upgraded. There were plenty of sun loungers around the pool. Lots of outdoor seating but used by the smokers. The entertainment team was fantastic throughout the day and in the evening. My main complaint was the poor internet connection which was hit and miss throughout the hotel and grounds.,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2019,5,Amazing experience,"We just returned form Iberostar, Agadir. The hotel is great, nice pools outside and one inside, is on the beach, good food, even is repetitive you won't have time to try everything, make reservations for traditional dinner. Entertainment team is amazing, those guys are really friendly and energetic all day. The shows in the evening are very nice, all the activities at the pool, the dancing. My daughter felt in love with the girls and boys from Kids club, thanks Fati and Ali specially. The snack bar is good, pizza, pancakes, paella, doughnuts made fresh in front of you. At the snack bar many thanks to Souffain, this boy is great, always very smiling and attentive, making jokes with my daughter. The gardens are very nice. The only problems are: internet, in the room almost doesn't…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2019,4,Relaxing,"Great relaxing hotel on the beach. Beautiful gardens. Lovely spa treatments at an average price. Friendly & efficient hospitality staff. Great variety of food at every meal, always fresh & of good quality. Strong alcoholic drinks. All inclusive definitely means you can eat & drink all day at this hotel if you wish. Reception toilets were not that clean when we arrived but after we filled in a feedback form the toilets were cleaned on a much regular basis. Our room was not ready at check in time but after speaking to a manager we got a room. Unfortunately this rooms toilet flush was broken. After being “fixed” 4 times we asked to be moved to a new room.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2019,4,Very Good,"We have just returned from a family holiday to the Iberostar Founty hotel, we had 2 weeks here all inclusive. The food was very good but a little repetitive, but plenty choice even for fussy eaters. The staff was very friendly around the hotel, the only thing I would say is the entertainment was horrendous, we had to walk out on some of the shows, I dont even think a child would watch them throwing them selves around the stage like animals, however the singer in the main bar on a evening, was brilliant and got everyone up dancing. He was far the best, so credit to him. We spoke to a lot of people around the pool and in the hotel and a lot of guests were saying the same. The day time entertainment was not up to the best either, I felt the hotel needed more staff around the pool…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2019,2,Living in the 60's,"Whilst ideally located on the beach, this hotel has wonderful position albeit that suites are a little dated however this whole experience gives a whole new meaning to OTT and living in the past. Think Cruise ship 'Love Boat' style or Kellerman's 'Dirty Dancing', it is like a camp with schedules events, locking in lounges around the pool, buffets breakfast, lunch & dinner with coloured wrist bands and Entertainment Shows 'Disco' which was woeful, Primary School kids can out perform. You seriously also need to recheck your entire list of Cocktail recipes, they are not using correct ingredients at all and way too sweet with syrups.

Check in was prompt, advised to go for lunch as room wasn't ready. We stayed in 3060 the furthest away from the reception, ground floor room overlooking the garden facing the promenade and beach. Room had lots of space and seating areas, small patio outside with table and chairs. Two bottles of water in the fridge on arrival you need to collect more water from the bars if needed. Large bathroom with shampoo, shower gel, hairdryer all provided. Hot water plentiful. Fresh towels daily. Room cleaned daily.

 October 2019,4,Great Hotel decent location,"5 day golf break with 6 lads so the Hotel was meant to be simply a base for us. The Iberostar proved to be a great surprise to us and saved the day as the golf was somewhat disappointing. Efficient and early check for us, sea view room, very spacious and clean. Food was fantastic, pool bar snacks / lunch etc was a massive bonus. Bar service was pretty good, even if the French did try and barge in, rude as they were. Quality of drinks on the whole ok, beer tasted indifferent, spirits and cocktails pretty good. Would defo come back with family, even if not for the golf next time. Weather for early October fantastic too. 15 minute walk into main town with plentiful bars and restaurants though the English Pub served quite expensive drinks.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 October 2019,4,Just missing a couple of touches!,"We stayed for 1 week. 3 women travelling alone and no issues at all. We had a good welcome from the staff on arrival and were given a room straight away even though it was before check-in time. The rooms are very spacious and extremely clean, but the beds are uncomfortable. We had to ask for mattress toppers, which staff dealt with immediately. The in-room safe had to be paid for, which I always think should be a standard item for a traveller. Ours stopped working, but we had a replacement delivered very quickly. All the staff work incredibly hard to keep the hotel clean and presentable. The food is OK, not the best I've had in a hotel, but there's plenty of choice. The bars are nice but the choice of alcohol is limited on the basic all inclusive package. The entertainment team…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2019,5,Great hotel and Animation team.,"Just come back from 10 days here at Iberostar Founty Beach and hotel was really nice. We walked along the bay to the marina and this hotel is by far one of the best. A lot of the hotels look dated and worn, but this one is very fresh and the reception is very traditional. Food was very good for an All Inclusive, mixed it up every lunch and dinner with different grilled meats and tagines. Pool side bar was great too with a great selection of food, not just chips and burgers like normal pool bars. Staff were excellent, and couldn’t do enough for you, although the reception staff could have been a bit more helpful but don’t let that put you off. All in all a great holiday. A special mention for Taoufik our waiter each night at the terrace bar and couldn’t do enough for us!",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Staff are friendly and polite especially animation team which was everyone! The rooms were clean and modern with traditional feel. Food was nice and good variety! I had my 2 teenage daughters with me and they had a great time. We also booked the spa hammam there and was worth it! Hotel right on the beach too. There really isn't anything negative I can say! If I want to be picky, the night time entertainment was cheesy and not great but that's with all hotels! We mainly relaxed in lobby as was nice and busy in evening.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 September 2019,5,2 Wonderful Weeks Away,Holiday Review Booked 14 nights for 2 through Travel Republic. We travelled from Scotland to Manchester and had an overnight stay at Clayton Hotel at Manchester airport where we also left our car for 2 weeks. Good value - Would recommend. Comfortable flight with Ryan Air and Private Pick up from Agidar Airport. It’s approximately a 40 minute drive to Iberostar Hotel. Tipping is expected and will accept all currency. Ensure you have small notes on you. All currency can be easily exchanged at hotel on arrival however if travelling from Scotland make sure you take Bank of England notes as no where in Morocco will except Scottish sterling.

We were then told to go and get a meal in the restaurant, all buffet style, I've never seen so much choice, all the food was excellent. Fresh, hot, and so much choice. Our room overlooked the sea and pool and was lovely, very big, clean and ideal storage spaces, bathroom was large too and the balcony area also large with table chairs and washing hanger. This hotel has everything from clean pools to ping pong tables, the animation work hard and theres so much you can participate in. I recommend aqua aerobics as it's such a good work out with the guy who runs it. He puts you through your paces and is a very good fitness instructor.

 September 2019,4,Hit and Miss hotel,The hotel is designed in Moroccan style and spotless. Entertainment staff do a fantastic job keeping everyone amused with games and fitness activities. The food is great with lots of local choices although breakfast has awful bacon and horrible sausages. There is an indoor pool which can be used free between 12 and 2pm only but it is full of kids and deafeningly noisy. The spa is blissful but has no direction signs. So when leaving a room you have no idea which way in the rabbit warren you should go. Our room was spacious and pretty but the bed was so hard I developed back ache. We asked for a mattress topper but they said they don't have these so extra sheets were put on instead which did little to improve it.,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 September 2019,5,Amazing!,"Just returned from a week in Founty Beach and me and my partner can’t fault a thing. Our room (2232) was very spacious,clean and facing the sea. Food selection everyday was great always something for everyone to have even if you are fussy! Drinks were 5 star no fault at all, made them exactly how you requested and cocktails were made fresh in front of you, soft drinks, water, beer and wines you can serve yourself but that’s no trouble at all. Entertainment was phenomenal in the hotel everyone is extremely friendly and go out of their way to speak to all groups of people. A special shout outs to people who stood out to ourselves over the week we were there: Mostafa, Ayoub, Brahim and Mimo you guys were great and do a fab job keep it up!

Although we checked in online for a rapid check in, it still took a while. I asked many times to pay in local currency but was still charged in UK£ at the hotel rate which is higher. As we were spending our last 4 days in Agadir and was AI, we didn't have much dirham left. We gave it all to our guide. The hotel insisted that to get pool towels we have to pay the refundable 100 dirham per towel. They couldn't put it on the credit card.

On check in, Reception was busy, so the Receptionist got one of the porters to put on our AI wrist bands and suggested we went straight to lunch and checked in afterwards - what a great idea! On check in you need to pay the local tax, also towel and safe deposits (approx £10 each per item) and daily safe charge if required. We were allowed to pay 500 MAD (approx £50) on credit card, the rest was due in cash - you can exchange sterling at the cash desk at the same time.

At the time I was fairly sunburnt to the point of redness and slight sensitivity to touch. I explained that I wasn’t too interested in any treatments/massages as I thought it wouldn’t be a good idea for me to have any treatments as my skin was delicate in these circumstances.

 June 2019,5,"Amazing Hotel, peaceful clean area","Just returned from a week at Iberostar Founty Beach in Agadir. I travel a lot and this is one of the best I’ve stayed in. From the welcome as we arrived to the the huge rooms everything was fab. All the staff from reception to the entertainment team and the restaurant worked tirelessly to ensure we had a good holiday. As an all inclusive you want for nothing. We travelled with my dad who is partially sighted and not walking to well they gave us rooms next to each other facing the pool 1006/1008 really big rooms with lovely balcony to get the afternoon sun. The cleaning team ensured our rooms were lovely and clean fresh sheets and towels whenever you needed them. The restaurant had something to suit everyone. I’m faddy but never had a problem in finding things to eat, so good…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2019,5,God Country King and .........,"An absolute wonderful hotel if you are looking for a relaxing break whether a family, group or just a couple. Superbly well organised for the vast amount of clientele that constantly are checking in and out for their stay. I have never seen so many varied fresh cooking stations at meal times together with a special dish of the day. There are so many different choices that one can not get bored unless you have a limited diet! All inclusive drinks are of very good quality and are available throughout the day and night with a special cocktail bar in the evenings on the terrace. The hotel grounds including the pool area are kept extremely clean at all times and staff work tirelessly to keep standards of this hotel high. You will often see the manager throughout the day walking…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2019,5,Great hotel,"We had a great stay at the Iberostar Founty Beach hotel, rooms were clean and spacious with balcony and sea view. Food was good and varied, should suit all tastes. The pool area had plenty of loungers and beach area nearby, the entertainment team were fun, encouraging guests but not too pushy. Big shout out to Jo and Simo who patiently helped us with Archery for the first time, always with a smile, evening entertainment also enjoyable. Only slight negative was the WiFi which was weak but would recommend to family and friends.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2019,3,Didn’t reach my expectations but I would go again,"There was nothing serious to complain about and I wouldn’t want my review to put anyone off of going but my general feedback - mainly for the hotel, is that it didn’t meet the high standards of other Iberostar hotels that we’ve stayed at. Starting with the good points, the hotel was nice, I liked the architecture and it was clean and modern. The facilities they have are really quite good, a nice reception area with seating and an adjacent bar, on-site spa, good area of sports facilities, large entertainment area with bar and a super pool area. It’s also right on the esplanade so good for a walk and just across the esplanade to the beach. There is a cordoned off area for the hotel and beach volleyball. Niggles were focussed quite a lot around communication and this could have…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2019,4,Nice for a fly and flop,"Stayed here in May for one week reception was ok got given a map and invited to a welcome meeting the next day we had a standard room on second floor with a partial sea view from balcony. Rooms spacious with decent bathrooms including shampoo and shower gel and decent towels. Bed and pillows were really comfortable. We got one bottle of water the whole week provided in the room a replacement in the fridge as we have had in other hotels would have been nice. No kettle in the room and it was a bit of a walk to lobby. We did take our own but had to keep remembering to replace the cups, so a kettle which is usually standard in most hotels would be good. You can get large bottles of water from the bar but once that is shut there is absolutely nowhere you can get them. My husband…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2019,4,Friendly but a bit disappointing,"After a lot of research and reading reviews we booked this hotel with our friends as we we both were celebrating our wedding anniversaries. We also emailed the hotel to let them know and also that one couple were vegetarian. We mentioned this on arrival but it felt that no notice was taken. We were shown to our room by the porter and no one explained the amenities of the hotel. We had to find this out our selves. The staff both poolside and the restaurants were very friendly and helpful. The buffet was limited especially for the vegetarian, it was virtually the same every day. However as we were allowed one meal in the Moroccan restaurant, we had this and it was excellent. Housekeeping is not much to be desired. Day one no body lotion of body wash. We requested this one was put…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2019,5,Can't fault it!!,"Just back today. This hotel is stunning, very clean. Food is fab, with loads of choice. All staff were amazing, attentive, hard working & the dancers were fab. Just a shame it was cloudy every day while we were away!!",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2019,5,Very nice stay friendly staff,Just sat at Agadir airport after a very relaxing week at the Iberostar. Maybe one of the best all inclusive hotels we have stayed at. The staff are all very friendly especially the entertainment team. Food is plentiful and yes gets a bit repetitive after a few days but the Al a Carte meal was nice for a change. The room was large and had a nice view over looking the pool and cleaned every day with clean towels on request. Yes it was well worth the money for the stay but I would point out that the English are in the minority at this hotel and a Polish travel company use it so one or two large groups who can seem to take over the place. The weather can be effected by the temperature inland and we have 4 days of cloud during our week but still warm to me but others went round in…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2019,4,"Nice little place to get away and relax under Sun, sand and sea.","The resort is of very descent quality amenities. It is very well decorated throughout and has modern still traditional Moroccan feeling. The rooms are well presented and clean. Only that the air conditioning was little funny and had couple of uncomfortably hot nights. The reception staff said it is only meant to keep room warm in cold nights!!! However, it wasn't an issue after couple of days though. It has only couple of pools for adults and one one of them was heated. Only that the heated pool is 1.7 meter deep throughout. It would have been better to have some shallow depth to allow kids to play around alone. Small kids had no issues with floats though. I would have preferred bigger pool to be heated instead of this smaller one. We are vegetarian family. The Antares…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2019,3,60th Birthday Disappointment,"My husband booked this hotel after some extensive research. We wanted a week in the sun together as a birthday treat. My husband e-mailed Iberostar before travelling advising it was a special birthday. On arrival at the hotel again he reiterated the reason we were there and asked to organise a cake etc. He was assured that the hotel were "" very attentive"" and the chef would attend to his request. We witnessed another guest recieving a birthday cake and the waiters singing happy birthday previous to my special day. My birthday cake and went, the only acknowledgement was in the form of a pre printed sheet left by the maid. No cake or congratulations. I can live with not being wished Happy Birthday but what I can't live with is bar staff making my husband feel uncomfortable ! On…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2019,4,Children become adults,"As a family, we decided on one last family holiday with a 22 year old and 23 year Old it was a prefect destination for sun bathing, we loved the all inclusive as this meant we could have a mojito at 10am!

 April 2019,5,Excellent hotel,Really enjoyed our stay here. Hotel was exceptionally clean throughout including the rooms as you expect and the grounds etc. All inclusive had plenty of varied options.

 April 2019,4,Great Resort Hotel to stay in Agadir,"Hotel offers 200 MAD per person for all meals, including drinks and snake. There are two restaurants on the list for the offer, however, only the one with buffet was opened for servive. The food was good, the service was on the weak side since most of the servers do not speak English. We had to go to lobby bar to get coffer and tea during lunch and dinner.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 March 2019,5,I would definitely stay at this hotel again,"Just had a lovely holiday this hotel. The rooms, and the hotel in general, were very nice and the staff were lovely. Because we went so early in the season the hotel was very quiet, so there was absolutely no difficulty getting a sun bed, and one of the pools was heated. The food was really good and the mojitos were excellent :-) My only complaint would be the length of time that it took to check in. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2019,1,Very rude reception manager,"Just arrived to this hotel, we've been terribly received at the reception especially by the manager who was very rude to us. Besides, rooms aren't family suitable. I highly DON'T recommend this hotel.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2019,4,Good hotel,"Stayed there for 3 nights in an all inclusive format. The family room is nice and suitable for families of 4-5 members. All staff members I met were welcoming and friendly in a surprising way compared to other hotels I visited either in Morocco or elswhere. The main activities that the hotel offers include, beside swimming, children camp where they organize activities for children that I didn’t use because we were here mainly for swimming and enjoying the sun. The food is good with a fair variety of choices, the timing of the three meals does not allow to each too much in each meal and the hotel seem to be strict in opening and closing hours of meals. The food is everywhere and it is not something I think someone will complain about :). I would definitely recommend the hotel…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2019,4,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for a week with my partner. Hotel was nice, communal areas were well presented, lots of seating and sun beds. Staff were friendly. Food was alright, good choice every night although it did become pretty predictable by the end of the week, the set-up of the restaurant meant that it was a bit like a food hall but not much you can do about that in all inclusive. They welcome families and children so not ideal if your looking for quiet dinner. The alacarte wasn’t anything to write home about but nice change to the food hall. It’s about a 20 minute walk to the town, right on the beach with paved path all the way. Great for running early morning. Nice room - reported on second day that aircon didn’t work, they sent someone but it never got fixed. Everything was…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

The rooms and Restaurant are bright, clean & comfortable. You can get Beach/ sunbathing Towels for a small refundable deposit at the reception. don't bother packing your own. There are plenty of activities to join in with during the day & the Animation Team work very hard and are all friendly & pleasant. The Evening Entertainment is fair but I wouldn't term the acts as 'Professional'. As a French speaking country this hotel attracts a lot of French holiday Makers so it is only natural that French is the main language spoken during the entertainment before…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 March 2019,5,A pleasant last minute holiday,"A friend and I have just returned from this hotel which we booked through Holiday Gems who were very helpful. We went for 10 nights (16-26 March) and our first impression on arrival at 9pm was very nice . The transfer from the airport was approximately 60 minutes. Check in was swift and our room was very pleasant and located on the ground floor with a pool view (Rm 3032), the hotel provided assistance with our luggage to our room but they do tend to hang around until you tip them. The cost to hire a safe for the time we were there was 30 Dirham per day and 100 deposit. Free WiFi throughout the hotel but could be intermittent. When morning arrived we could see from our terrace the pool and gardens which looked lovely. There was a fridge in our room as well as a hairdryer…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 March 2019,5,FABULOUS 4 STAR HOTEL,"Had to write a review as soon as possible after returning yesterday evening. We booked a standard room which I upgraded to a Sea view room and it was an amazing view across the bay and out to the marina.and well worth the upgrade. The room was a decent size with a small fridge but unfortunately kettle for making coffee, easily solved as we took our own mini kettle. Their are 2 USB ports either side of the bed. The staff are very friendly and helpful special mention the 2 girls behind reception, I believe both named Karima. There are 2 outdoor pools, 1 heated but no shallow end the other cold water and very refreshing :-). The food is very nice and of a good selection obviously the choice is pretty much the same every night, if you fancy a change try the Pure Passion restaurant…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 March 2019,5,Great hotel!,"3 friends staying in room 3150 which had a sea view and a large enough bedroom to accommodate 3 single beds comfortably. Room was quite a distance from reception and it would have been nice to have a kettle for a cuppa in the morning. No noise at night and three of us had good nights sleep. Food was plentiful, hot & tasty and accommodated everyone’s needs. Staff were very pleasant and reception staff helpful. Plenty of sunbeds and the beach bar/cafe was great. Would have been nice to have waiter service by the pool but that’s me being lazy! The only down side would be the distance to the town centre. We only walked it once - a good half an hours walk and such a shame that there were no bars/shops on the way to shorten the journey.

The outside swimming pool was heated (very nice). The spa swimming pool heated too. Spa free btw 12:00-14:00. The food is fine not very tasty but good variety.

My only criticism was that the showers were very slippy underfoot (more so, than the average), so take care, and the bed was on the hard side. Would happily return.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 March 2019,5,Couldn't really fault it.,"We originally tried to book a neighbouring hotel but it was full so booked the Founty Beach based on the number of positive feedbacks. It's a large hotel, travelling in March it never felt busy, I would imagine it feels very different high season. We stayed on the ground floor and every morning could see staff machine cleaning the floor,cleaning the windows and eating areas. The hotel is spotless. The pool is a real highlight, and it is heated. Staff were very good in all areas, special mention to Ayouab and Nordine in the top bar. The animation team make an effort engage with everyone at some stage. Nice people. The only negative, and this is very minor. Is that the a la carte restaurant is a bit underwhelming.

 March 2019,5,A Good Winter Break,"First visit to Morocco; hotel reasonable distance from airport. There are many positives - the staff are lovely and although as English people we were in a minority (most visitors from Germany and France), many staff coped well with speaking English. There is a very good range of food and drinks, although wine wasn't that great; the bubbly served on a couple of occasions was very drinkable. Having themed evenings, including well made sushi was interesting and welcome. Bedrooms are a good size and very comfortable; great shower. Nice swimming pools and bar/refreshment area. The beach was quiet and sea safe and fun. Beach towels much nicer than the bath towels. We celebrated two birthdays whilst here, and flowers, congratulations note and bottle of bubbly from 'Management' very…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 March 2019,5,Restful Holiday in Beautiful Surroundings,"Hotel set in a horseshoe shape by the beach. From the start, all staff were helpful and friendly - from the reception staff, through to those who had roles in Animation, Cleaning, Gardening, Waiting and Catering; many of which can speak several languages. Restaurant: Food is of the highest standard, with Moroccan dishes a regular each evening along with a speciality of the day - eg, Sushi. There are always meat and fish dishes that can be accompanied by the wide range of salad, roasted vegetables, rice, cous cous, or chips. To note, men cannot wear shorts for dinner. At peak times we did find it difficult to locate a table for the four of us, especially it is not always easy to know whether or not a table is occupied.

Animations team work so hard and there are some fab dancers! The hotel is spotless and you can see everyone works really hard. There isn’t much to do in Agadir for children but we were happy staying in the hotel this holiday as we are usually so busy at home! The only thing that wasn’t great was information at check in!

 December 2018,4,"Iberostar really impressed me, above and beyond (shame about some guests however...)","I would have never expected myself booking an Iberostar hotel in Morocco of all places but when weighing up my options it appeared they offer the best All inclusive option within Agadir. I based my opinion upon a few factors, the first being that although they sell pork they offered assurances its cooked in a separate environment and also served well away at a distance from the rest of the food (other than this all food served is Halal), the hotel has a selection of Mocktails (non alcoholic cocktails) and has a selection of premium drinks such as Fanta and Coke (all the listed are inclusive in the price).

The heated pool was fabulous with plenty of sun beds. The buffet both in the restaurant and by the pool have such a huge selection, there is always something even for the fussiest eaters. There is plenty of entertainment if you want it. Even though it was very warm in February there was a very cold wind on the beach, however the pool and pool bar are is designed so that there are plenty of places to sit where you can avoid the cold blast. My only issue is that once you step foot outside there is nothing at all to do and no character. Agadir town is a bit of a walk along the prom which is nice .

Outdoor pools both good, used the heated one and unheated one. Very good choice in the buffet restaurant. It wasnt fine dining and buffet restaurants rarely are but I would say above the level of other four star hotels I have stayed at.

 December 2018,5,Excellent hotel just got better,"Although we have been to this hotel many times, this was our first time back after the refurbishment. The restaurant is a lot brighter and airy and doesn’t have as much of a “canteen” feel to it now. The lunch and snack bar has been remodelled and no longer has the funny little kiosks which used to house the dessert and salad area. All in all, -and this applies especially to the rooms- the hotel feels a lot fresher and brighter. Thankfully the one thing that hasn’t changed is the staff. Despite being closed for quite a while a lot of the old staff have returned. I was very happy to see Noredine and Saada are still working in the bar, they are a credit to the hotel.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2019,4,Restful holiday,"Had a really restful week here, you could if wished, take part in some activities -archery , ping, pong , tennis, aqua aerobics happened out of the pool ? Probably due to it being low season and only one pool is heated ! Food looked great , became a little predictable by the end of the week , but enough variety to cover most tastes, although rarely saw burgers ! Would recommend making use of the second resataurant which you can visit once in your trip , food much more authentic serviced in tangines. Staff always friendly and helpful .",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 January 2019,5,A lovely lazy vacation,"We drove from Marrakech to Agadir on sunday, january 20th 2019, a friend of mine had been there before at the Iberostar Founty Beach and was going there again this january so me and my boyfriend decided to join his group of friends for a week. Neither of us had ever been to Morocco before so we started with one day in Marrakech just to get to see a little bit more of the country (and have a hot air balloon ride). The hotel in Agadir was amazing, clean spacious room with a balcony, really nice pool yard, overflowing buffet with various dishes and such friendly staff we even made a friend (thank you Brahim). Our stay there was relaxing and wonderful, in great company, meeting some really nice people from Poland and Austria in particular.

 February 2019,4,Value for money,"Stayed here on Feb. Only 30 minutes transfer from the airport.Reception was ok . We was given a sea view room which I paid extra ; which to be honest doesn’t do any justice as the balcony is made of concrete and you have to stand up to enjoy the view. Food was good every night there’s something new, And there’s a restaurant downstairs that you can book once and servers Moroccan cuisine. On the website it entice you to try oysters before leaving the hotel but nowhere to be found in the restaurant on my 7 nights stay. Staff in the bar and restaurant were non stop very friendly and polite. there’s a girl on day shift duty makes the best mojitoentertainment can be repetitive they should encourage more guests to interact or join the singers at night time.

 February 2019,5,Brilliant experience,"My family and I stayed here for 9 nights during the middle of February. We stayed on an all inclusive basis and had a poolside room. We arrived around 2130 and had just missed dinner, the receptionist checked us in and arranged for our bags to be taken to our room. He also had cold meats, cheese and rolls sent to the room which was very considerate. The room had two single beds(which we joined together) and a sofa bed which was already made up for us. The bathroom has a large shower, sink, toilet and bidet but no tub, large mirror and marble tiles and a mounted hair dryer.

 February 2019,5,fantastic hotel even better after the major refurbishment,"This is the only hotel we have ever been back to. The value for money for what you pay compared with the quality of the food, service and rooms is second to none. The quality of the food is exceptional. Agadir is a port and seafood at the main restaurant is in ambundance with several fish courses on offer during our week long stay. We were pleasantly surprised to see langoustines, mussels and clams on one evening. Breakfast is within the main restaurant and as others have commented there is a fresh pure orange juice / smoothies made by a chef. There is the other usuale selection fo breakfast including cereral, cooked breakfast and fresh omlettes and pancakes. We mainly had lunch at the pool restaurant.

 February 2019,3,Day time good - evening / service needs improving,"A lovely hotel building with clean rooms and luxurious surroundings. Pools and day time snack bar are superb. Restaurant has a wide choice of freshly cooked food and fruit however waiting staff need further training as our table wasn't cleaned after we asked for previous diners dirty plates, cutlery and glasses to be removed whilst we fetched our meal - leaving us standing with plates of food and having to find another member of staff to assist and clean the table. The original waiter returned and patted me on the back as if to say it doesn't matter even though he left dirty plates next to us which I removed. This was a let down and not what I would expect from the hotel.

Wonderful mural of a bird on the wall (which my daughter fell in love with). Great view of the sea from the balcony. Although we were there for only a short time it was clear that the staff cared.

Entertainment is absolutely flawless(amazing and very talented dancers). Kids disco is cute and fun both for kids and children(my son waited every evening for the same). Kids club is brilliant( Bushra is so attentive and kind with children). All the staffs are very kind and helpful. Swimming pools are superb( no slides for kids though). Heated pool in the spa is brilliant. Wide variety of delicious food. I like the idea of having lunch at pool side.

 February 2019,5,Excellent hotel with fantastic staff who work tirelessly to ensure your needs are met!,"Having assessed the standard of hotels in Agadir I knew that the Iberostar was the best 4* option available. It exceeded expectations from the moment I arrived - the staff on reception were friendly and welcoming and you could immediately see that the groundsmen were working throughout the day to ensure the gardens were well maintained. The food options for breakfast, lunch and dinner were great. Lots of options available to cater for all dietary requirements. The chocolate fountain at dinner was a highlight! The bedrooms were cleaned to a high standard daily and you couldn't fault the amenities on offer in the rooms, including the bathroom.

A la carte restaurant - is NOT !!!! A la carte means 'your choice from menu'. This is table d'hote - you get what your given !! It was ok, and the ambiance is lovely, but the food was very bland ('international' taste ?). Food in main restaurant is very much better ! Location, facilities - all perfect ! Which is why we returned ! It was our fourth visit to Agadir, and we love it. Have just tried different hotels. The Founty has the BEST food ! But - there's always a 'but' !! The refurb is disastrous in the restaurant. If I was management I would be chasing those responsible !!! The floor is badly worn and looking tatty already - in approximately two years !!!

 February 2019,5,One word ...... Fabulous,"So we’re just back from out first trip to Iberostar Founty Beach and I can’t wait to go back already. Location is perfect, right on the beach with lovely promenade. Food was really good & lots of fresh salads & would suit even a fussy eater like me. Bar staff are exceptional, very friendly. Rooms are lovely. We upgraded to pool view & was worth it. The entire place was spotlessly clean & even my husband approved ( and he is OCD about cleaning). We are a couple in our 40’s and for once enjoyed an all inclusive holiday without seeing anyone overdoing it in the bar. I think this was due to the average age which is older. Well done to all staff who work very hard and were so helpful & friendly to everyone. Will definitely be back.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2019,5,Just as amazing as ever!!!,"I cannot remember how many times we have stayed we've stayed at Founty Beach but this was our first visit since the referb and it's just as good if not better in many ways! The rooms and restaurant have been wonderfully refreshed; definite positive from my son (8) is the great variety of the TV channels now, the swimming pools (of course), the staff (as usual) and the entertainment each night (he did prefer the late show as did many other children, personally I would of liked for him to of seen a little less flesh at some points during this) but was all thoroughly enjoyed by all.

 January 2019,4,"Spotlessly clean, very helpful staff","We spent 10 nights at the Iberostar in Agadir. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the cleaning staff were very active all day. We had tried to book our room online but the system wasn’t working but we still had a specific area of the hotel in mind. All of the reception staff were always helpful and the lovely Karima went above and beyond to sort out a room in the area we wanted - thank you! The food was always plentiful and hot. My husband, as a meat eater, has endless choices, for myself as a veggie this was more limited and kitchen staff were not always aware that cross contamination of food for veggies is an issue so would wear the same gloves to, eg handle cooked meat and cheese and this was offputting. If the hotel made one of the food stations as a veggie station this…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2019,5,Quick stopover,"What a gem of a place this is. We booked late and for one night only, the first time I have ever stayed in an all inclusive hotel. I must say that it was amazing! Rooms were large, bright and with balconies. Bathroom was huge and absolutely spotlessly clean. The food was unbelievable with so many choices that you were spoilt for choice!!

All I can say is thank you to all the staff and I'll be back soon!!",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 December 2018,5,A week in Morocco,"We stayed for a week in founty beach with a family of 4. The staff of the hotel welcomed us warmly the moment we arrived, around 10-11pm. There was a wide variety of food in the hotel buffet, and there is a couple chefs preparing some of the food for you. Usually the menu consisted of different themes, for example Italy, or fish in an separate table. There was also the Moroccan style table which stayed the same throughout the week. A rather wide variety of vegetarian choices was also included. My personal favorite was anyway the dessert choices. We participated also in some activities during the week. The activities are arranged by a certain staff group, who tend to gather participants among the sunbathers around the pool area. I personally got to know some of the activity…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

The room is just the right size, with sun on the balcony in the morning and really for most of the day. The food is too good, so prepare to walk a lot to make up for eating too much.

We go the same week every year and recognise a lot of the guests so it shows you how good this hotel is! The food is plentiful as well as an impressive all inclusive array of drink without virtually any restrictions. It is immaculately clean throughout (though I did notice that the floors in the rooms were not dust free from the beds to the balcony).

 December 2018,5,Nothing too much,"Our group stayed at Iberostar during New Year eve. From the moment we checked in I knew that we would have a nice stay here. The staff were so friendly and gave service with a smile.This was the case throughout our stay. The hotel worked really hard to provide us with the atmosphere for new years eve to enjoy and celebrate the coming of 2019. Good range of food and drink. Only whinge, though most hotels now do this, is that sauna/jacuzzi is run by an external company and not a part of the all inclusive deal, and no mini fridge in room. I don't want to mention specific staff as all were so friendly and helpful. Our groups congratulations to all at Iberostar for their great service.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

At least a dozen different dishes to choose from each evening. Breakfast was by far the best I have had in Morocco with a complete range of foods to suit all tastes, including cooked-to-order fried eggs with bacon every day!

Poor check in then poor dealing with a query and then awful check out. They just did not seem interested. Had a great stay otherwise and Shane as the rest of the staff were great.

 December 2018,4,6 months later,"We have been staying at this hotel for 13 years now, sometimes twice a year. We loved our visit in May & were impressed at the refurbishments & the food changes that had been made. The food this time, just over 6 months later, was unfortunately not as good. Still lots of choice but a lot of repetition during the week. We had roasted chickens 3/7 nights & pork 2/7 when they used to do lots of different roasted joints like lamb & beef, oysters & sushi were also sadly missed. There was still plenty of food tho & it was still hot & tasty. I think all this was mainly due to the lack of guests, as the hotel was incredibly quiet for this time of year (5-12 Dec) There was only a handful of children, so no kids club for my son (age 5).

We literally have nothing to put down that is negative about the hotel or the location it has been exceptional. The Moroccan staff cannot do enough for you.

Our room was very spacious and the housekeeping was first class. Always had plenty of hot water and complimentary toiletries available. The hotel is has its own private beach which we did not visit, and there is a beautiful walk along the beach to the marina (around 40 minutes). You meet plenty of street sellers along the way, however that is part of the fun. The main restaurant has plenty of choice and they request that long trousers are worn at dinner.

 December 2018,5,"Great location, food and service","Stayed for a week in December. Could not ask for anything more, food was plenty and tasty (European, Moroccan etc). Ate more in a week than we did in a month at home :D. The best part is probably the heated large pool (has a heated children's pool as well). If you want to just relax, read a book, swim in a warm pool during winter months when at home its -20 C, then this is a great place. We had a Junior Suite ant it was very spacious and clean. In terms of attractions there is much in Agadir, so you will have to take trips further from it, but as I said Iberostar is best for a timid relaxing holiday.

The man then needed to be wrestled away from the other guy with four staff!

The hotel was beautiful with the rooms very large and clean; the pool area was great and had plenty of sunloungers, and the beach was right on our doorstep.

My only suggestion, perhaps an additional restaurant for evening dinner (outside restaurant used for lunch could perhaps be a BBQ offering on some days to give a little more choice?).",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 February 2018,4,Good value for money,"Stayed here for 5 nights - all inclusive. If I was to return to agadir would definitely stay here again.

Good bars and clubs within short walking distance. The beach itself was very bad - glass on the beach and lots of hassle. So stuck to chilling by the pool.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Yes, if there are about 40 choices of food at every lunch and dinner there will inevitably be an element of repetition, but the quality was very high and the choice was great. The all-inclusive drinks were generous. Premium brands incurred an extra cost but the included ones were perfectly good. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean with a little balcony.

 November 2018,5,4 Night Winter Jolly,"After recently returning from a 4 night stay, we were disappointed to head home so soon. The hotel was clean, modern and spacious, with staff that were always on the go! All the staff were friendly and happy to make conversation. There was security at the front and the back of the hotel, and a constant supply of taxis. We paid 220d each way, to and from the airport. The food was excellent, however, slightly repetative. The pizza at lunch was delicious and the pancakes yummy! A great extra was being able to help yourself to beer, wine, hot and fizzy drinks. The heated pool was great in the cooler weather. There were well fed resident cats which were very cute!! We would happily return, but hopefully for longer than 4 days :)",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 October 2018,4,Nice Stay,"We went as a group of 11 in the October half term for 1 week. The hotel was very clean and you could see that the staff worked very hard to keep it this way. There were painters, waiters and cleaners around all the time. Pros: Rooms were clean Lovely grounds Lots of shelving for clothing (is a problem in many hotels but not this one!) The beach is on the doorstep Excellent security, at no point were children allowed outside the hotel without parent supervision which was the BEST! Evening entertainment was varied and the kids particularly enjoyed the mini disco.

 November 2018,5,A place to come back to,"We never go to the same place twice. Agadir and Iberostar Founty Beach being an exception!

Situated by the beach offering surf opportunities, camel back riding and long walks. A perfect and safe place to go to with family and friends.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2018,5,Lovely and perfect place for both relaxing and axtivities,"Lovely place with very sweet and friendly staff. Dark sand on the beach and always big waves. The food is fresh and delicious, but lacks spices. Nice pool area, but sometimes a little too loud music in order to relax. But it is typical when there are activities. The bar closes a little early if you are the kind who wants to party until late into the night",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 November 2018,5,Fantastic week's holiday!!!!,"I travelled here with my wife and two daughters aged 14 and 8 for a one week holiday. The hotel is lovely and set in beautiful grounds, the reception staff are helpful and when we arrived it at 2am in the room we had fresh fruit and a salad each waiting for us. The rooms were lovely and clean and had been recently refurbished and were to a high standard, the maids came every day to clean the room and leave fresh towels. The pool area is great with plenty of sunbeds and 2 large pools (one of which is heated) and a small toddler pool, there are also life guards around the pool all day. The food in the hotel was very good also with plenty of selection for all, we have two kids who are fussy eaters and they were always happy.

 November 2018,5,One week in Iberostar FB - one of the best hotel experience.,"I, my wife and our two daughters spend a great holiday time in this hotel/resort in early November, the weather was great, location was quiet, loads of activities for kids and grown ups, private and secured beach, heated pool, plenty sunbeds. The food was really good, I'm very picky when it's about food but here was a large variety with a lot of local food and the fish was never missing. The downstairs restaurant was just ok, but they have set menu and the kids and my wife didn't like it so much, I enjoy it because I loved the moroccan good but I can't say the same for the rest of my family. The room was large and modern, we've stayed in suit, cleaned everyday and always the room made leave us surprises on beds and in bathrooms which made kids very happy.

 November 2018,4,"Lovely hotel, spacious rooms, great pool area","This is a lovely hotel with great staff, rooms are lovely, pool area great. Only downfall is the evening entertainment shows which are not great compared to other hotels I've stayed in in Agadir. Special mention to Hamada, Chou Chou, Zak, Jalil and Momo in the animation team who were great! Moustafa at the pool bar! Ayoub, Rachid and Noedine in main bar!

 November 2018,5,Holiday,"We have just come back from staying at the Iberostar Founty Beach for 7 nights. We could not fault the hotel. The food was very good and so was the drink. A couple of the staff were not very friendly, one in the main bar and one on reception, but the majority were very friendly.The entertainment team were very good at what they do without being to pushy. If i was to return to Morocco i would definately be going back to this hotel. For people who like to run, there is a path along the beach front from the hotel to the Marina, it is about 4.5 mile round trip, very safe and a nice flat run. Lots of people out exercising from 7 in the morning. The people selling on the beaches are fine too. We didnt find them pushy at all. Do not use Jumbo to book trips, we got ripped off with the…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 November 2018,4,Nice all-inclusive hotel on ocean shore,"Great location to stay with family or friends for those who like crowded lazy vacations with all-inclusive option. Food was great and changing each day, especially big selection during dinner. Hotel surroundings well maintained. Our kid loved heated pool outside during windy cloudy days we met on end of October beginning of November. Family rooms are on first floor, with some small ants inside, but it was not problem for us. Double rooms are same size as family rooms just without divided room space and no ants as on higher floor. Just we would prefer room cleaning floor washing to be upgraded. In total - we liked our stay there.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2018,4,Amazing,"I highly recommend the hotel, we went for our friend's birthday and we had a great time.

 October 2018,2,Think twice about visiting this hotel,"I gave never stayed at an Oberstar hotel and never will again, this place is not worth the money or the star rating... 1. Rooms, ok, clean I guess,ants everywhere but we are in a different country.you have to pay for the safe, 100d deposit and 30d a day -rip off 2. Food, after day 3 of all inclusive we exhausted the options, complimentary a la carte booking- just the same food but in a different place. 3. Entertainment, seriously bad...don't waste your holiday, run by a bunch of young kids 4. Swimming pool, this gets the worst review, day one, I moved my sunbed by 1ft out of the shade and was told to move it back.. also day one, my 7 year old was told he could not wear his t shirt in the pool, no jumping in the pool, you get whistled at and a finger shake at you, no food or…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 October 2018,5,Amazing hotel! And people,"Just come back from a week family stay with my sister, nephew, husband, mum and dad. It is an amazing hotel. Cleaned daily, windows, doors and pool. Food was great and lots of choices even for fussy eaters. Pool staff and animation team were fantastic, great with the children and really enjoyed getting involved in the wide range of activities they had to offer. Momo was the best, so friendly and my nephew absolutely loved him! Even on the rainy day they provided games and indoor entertainment so always something to do. The bar was good but very small and not many seats. So get there early. The hotel shows were very entertaining and funny, suitable for all. Will be returning.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2018,5,Relaxing week in lovely surroundings,"I was travelling on my own and was a bit concerned about my safety in the surrounding area but I had no need to be concerned, the promenade by the beach is lovely to walk along both in the day time and in the evening - I quite often walked along the promenade in the evening after my evening meal before enjoying a mojito (or two) in the hotel's bar. There were quite often people by the beach trying to sell things but once you politely said no thank they left you alone which is a pleasant surprise after experiencing the same thing in other countries (Turkey and India) where they just keep hassling you. There was always a security guard at the entrance gate back into the hotel's grounds as well. There is a great choice of food for all meals, the main restaurant is buffet…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 October 2018,3,Okay but not great,"I have never been to Agadir before - so not sure what to expect or comparisons with competition in the area. I can only compare to previous Iberostars I have stayed at. The building is impressive and very similar to others I have stayed in...however... The Gym ...- I knows its not for everyone, but it is a main factor on my holiday breaks - I like a good gym and a good workout - I did my research looked at a lot of photos and descriptions and felt it matched my needs - Boy, I was wrong - the gym was very poor - there was no treadmill - there was a space were obviously there had been one previously and also reflected in the photos I had seen which showed the treadmill, however the machine had obviously broke and not repaired or replaced - there are no standalone weight…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 September 2018,5,Fantastic 2 week holiday,"We stayed in Founty Beach for 2 weeks starting 11/09/18 and we had the most amazing 2 weeks away. I travelled with my husband and 3 year old daughter. The staff were fantastic, really friendly and made such an effort with us and my daughter. Her favourite person was the ‘cat man’ a waiter working in the restaurant who made meow noises at her each time he saw her. Our room was modern, clean and huge. We enjoyed the food, weather, hotel and learning about their culture! We booked 4 tours with Admire Morocco and they were all amazing, the staff were great and so happy to help! The only thing That was slightly awkward was that there’s limited lifts and for the evening when my daughter was asleep in her buggy we had to walk quite a way to a lift to reach our floor. Not too much of a…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2018,4,Sun and service,"We spent 4 nights at the Iberostar Founty Beach in Agadir and what a great way to start our tour of Morocco! The highlight for me was the sunshine, warm weather in October, and the gorgeous swimming pools. For someone who swims for exercise, these pools were a real treat. Although they don’t have designated lap lanes, they were big enough to swim for a good workout. The rooms were big enough and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was plentiful, fresh and actually tasty. For less expensive sunscreen and SIM cards, visit the little markets on the street about a quarter mile from the resort. To improve... the Moroccan restaurant on the lower level needs some attention. The food and experience was bland. No Moroccan music or special food that you couldn’t find in…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2018,4,Lovely place,Just back from a weeks stay here....all I can say is that it was far better than expected and can only echo what other people have said really. Everyone has different opinions about things so no one will ever be 100% satisfied. I just try to be honest with my opinions on trip advisor and accept everyone likes different things. Most staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were large bright and clean. Shower amazing . Plenty of hot water. Clean towels every day. Spa was amazing well worth spending time there would highly recommend Restaurant spacious and clean and bright. Again most staff courteous and helpful. Food was plentiful at all times..and whilst some of it was repetitive there was still plenty of choice every day so something to please everyone in my opinion.

 October 2018,4,Beautiful hotel,"Just returned from a great 10 day break here at this lovely, recently refurbished hotel. Everywhere was kept immaculately clean and the hotel was very well run. We had a really big room in a great location. The food was very enjoyable with lots of choices and some theme nights. The staff were all pleasant, friendly and helpful! There loads of daytime activities for those who wished to partake, but as a lot of people just wanted to relax, we felt the music was unecessary loud! The only weak point was the evening entertainment. There was music in the bar from 8.30 - 9.30, which ceased for an hour when the entertainment team put their very amateurish dancing and lip syncing show on downstairs in the theatre. We found this cringe worthy and boring! Also, it was difficult to…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 October 2018,5,Excellent!,We stayed in Iberostar Founty Beach for a week at the beginning of October. It was a great holiday. The cleanness and hygiene were on a high level.

The personel in general was not only freindly but seemed genuininly happy that we were there. Admitttdly, many of the staff outside didn't know English that well, but it was quite easy to communicate with everybody. Especially the personell in the spa and around the pool were incredibly open-hearted and we felt welcomed and valued. The rooms are comparably large and always properly cleaned. Even from the baconies on the side of the hotel, which didn't face the sea, one had at least a partly sea-view.

 October 2018,3,Basic Hotel,"We've just come back from a week here & it was ok, nothing amazing though. The hotel: Staff are friendly; Zak helped us out at the end which we appreciated. Very little in the way of entertainment, one main bar where everyone goes & not a lot of seating to accommodate everyone. Food choice in the buffet was very much the same each day, definitely need more variety. A lot of the signs weren't in front of the food so we didn't know what it was half the time. Health & Safety isn't a big thing, my friend slipped on the stairs which were wet after being mopped & there was no wet floor signs. Told the manager & all they said was ""ok"" Cleaners didn’t lock our garden door which meant someone walked into our room from outside when we were in there.

 August 2018,5,Love Iberostar,"Yet another holiday in Iberostar and I can say that I basically treat that place like a home 😃 After the renovations, the rooms have been brightened up and modernised. I just miss the fact that there used to be more storage space for clothes etc. I find that it’s hard to unpack all my clothes into the space that’s provided. The bathrooms have also been renewed and the baths have been replace with a spacious shower, which in my opinion was a great idea! The freshly pressed/ squeezed juices at breakfast have definitely brought up the standards of the hotel. The staff in the restaurants, at the reception and the cleaning staff are at the highest standards. Sadly after years the animations have been changed. That standard has unfortunately fallen. The animations are done without…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Director Brahim mention chef are not experience in special dietary request, in my case vegetarian. The coffee in the morning is from machine, taste bitter and you have to self serve.

The standard of the rooms has majorly improved and this has added to the overall luxury level in the hotel. There is just one minor detail concerning this that could be considered a downgrade; before the renovations this year the rooms had more storage space like a small chest of drawers which cannot be found in the rooms anymore. If you are staying in a family room for 4 people, it is possible to get one of the double beds exchanged into a sofa and another single bed (this was something which was done for me as my two daughters who each had separate beds on any of the other occasions we had the pleasure of staying in Iberostar did not want to share a bed this…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Always freshly cooked. Stayed on an all inclusive basis which always works well for me. All of the staff I dealt with were friendly and client oriented. A very enjoyable holiday. Saw a few changes made here and their with the refurbishment. Dining room has a new look. Just nice to see the same staff at work their as before.

 July 2018,2,Upgrade was a Down grade,"Stayed at the Iberostar Founty beach for a week in August, we had booked a family room and a separate double room. Two weeks before our trip I decided to upgrade to two family rooms paying a hefty supplement but was happy to pay the extra to have two family rooms together for more space. The room we upgraded to was poor, leaking shower, flashing bright alarm, broken doors, blocked sink, dirty bathroom. these rooms were advertised as recently upgraded!!

 May 2018,5,Amazing - we were blown away !,"Iberostar Founty Beach. As a couple of 12 years, newly married with a 2 year old son, travelling for us is now a very different & requires enormous logistical planning & patience. Wanting to go overseas & somewhere hot we searched for family orientated options within a four hour flight time from the airport. Morocco has been on my wish list for some time so we were very pleased to find Iberostar founty hotel right on the beach in Agadir with a full board all-inclusive deal. We set off very early from the UK & arrived at Agadir airport mid-morning, a scary & hair raising race through the streets by our booked taxi dodging Lamborghinis’, donkeys, mopeds & camels to reach the hotel at around noon.

The hotel is lovely, clean and welcoming, cleaned every day, fresh towels etc. Them maids work damn hard. Cannot fault the pool area, or the food really, lots of choice and fresh and lovely food, just don’t expect a full English breakfast as such (take your own ketchup or brown sauce 😁!). The night time entertainment is s bit hit and miss, especially if you’re English, bit more aimed at other Europeans, which is fair as the majority of guests weren’t English!

I have to congratulate Iberostar on having such a friendly, enthusiastic and cheerful group of employees, from the cleaners through to the animation team. The place is well kept and clean.

(We had booked a sea view room) There are three pools, to suit everyone and the lifeguards are very attentive. On our first day I witnessed one such lifeguard rescue a small child on his way in to work. The sun beds do get taken fairly early on in the morning, but we could still find two together after 9am.

 August 2018,4,Impeccable standards of service.,Spent a week here recently again after it’s refurbishment. Great facilities and services throughout. All staff are very children friendly and will go out of their way to help you. Diverse range of food and drinks a plenty with good turnaround albeit tastes being a little repetitive after over a week. Plenty of reps around to keep you informed of the daily activities and entertainments. The room was clean and replenished on a daily basis. The biggest disappointment is the quality of the wifi at the hotel. Even in the lobby the signal is poor let alone the rooms. Overall a quality hotel for a certain type of clientele.,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

The drinks are also really good. From cocktails to soft to coffee everything is good. It is advised to not drink the water from your room. But you can get FREE bottle of mineral water at every bar. The personnel is NICE and take really care of you. The beach is right in front of the hotel (1min walk). There are a lot of families but as a couple we did not found any problem with that. It was easy to relax and enjoy our vacations. The animation team is great. We will come back.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 July 2018,4,Absolutely lovely hotel 👌🏽,"We arrived late on a Saturday evening and were greeted by a very welcoming receptionist who allowed us to go for dinner before checking in as the restaurant was due to close in 10 mins. From then we knew we were in for a good stay. Room was faultless, clean, well looked after and spacious. There was no major rush for sun beds in the morning and the pool area was clean and plenty big enough. There was lots of daily activities to get involved in around the pool and on the beach, like archery and aqua gym, throughout the day if you wanted too. Food was cooked fresh daily and there was a wide variety however choices didn’t change daily so towards the end of the week it did get a bit tedious. Last but certainly not least the staff, from waiting staff to entertain staff, were…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 July 2018,4,Excellent hotel with excellent facilities,"This hotel is probably the best resort in Agadir. We stayed 7 days and had all-inclusive. We were a family with three children and enjoyed a lot with every thing including the superb meals, the pools, the beach (just outside). Staff were kind and helpfull. The rooms were also excellent except the beds, which could be more comfortable. We will surely return, inshallah.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 June 2018,5,Fantastic short stay in Iberostar Founty Beach,My first time in Agadir and Morrocco I spent 5 nights on my own as a single woman recently after after visiting Marrakech Check in was quick & easy my room wasn't ready when I arrived at 1pm but the receptionist gave me my AI band so that I could get food & drinks and when I returned about 1 hr later my room was ready for me The hotel is new and while i was there they had there official opening The hotel grounds are immaculate and beautiful There is a large snack bar / restaurant right at the back near the beach if you don't want to eat in the main restaurant. Good choice of food My room was spacious with a balcony the bed was super comfy and the air con was was excellent . It had a fridge and a safe The free wifi was excellent fast and worked all over the hotel as…,Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 July 2017,3,Good and bad.,"We booked this hotel for it's location in Agadir and for the all inclusive option. We are a family of 4, two children aged 7 and 8 therefore prefer food to be included with different options available. Upon arrival we found the hotel to be clean, also quite busy. We were dealt with quickly and given a ground floor room. I did not like this room. It opened up onto a garden that was accessible by all guests thus we always had to have the curtains pulled over when in the room. The facilities in the room such as tv was poor and shower gave us some problems with water pressure and temperature. We had to call staff numerous times for such issues but was always dealt with quickly. The food was amazing with lots of choice for my picky children. One thing that really annoyed me was…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

Animators are really nice and fine ;)",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2018,5,Great hotel,"We have been in May in Iberostar Founty Beach and it was simply great. Last year we were first time in one of the Iberostars hotels in Mallorca, and both Moroccan Iberostar and that one in Mallorca have the same excellent level of service and cleanliness. Staff was nice and professional, and food absolutely for every taste and with enough variety. Since it was out of season, there were just enough people not be crowded so enough sunbeds and umbrellas. Mini club was fun for our 7 year old, young ladies working there very friendly. Since the weather in May was quite windy and not really for swimming and usual beach or pool activities, we have played tennis, i have enjoyed daily Pilates like exercises...so in every way happy with our stay and time in Morocco. Just to add that…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2018,5,Iberostar founty beach. Agadir. Morocco,"Our fisrt holiday to Morocco, Agadir at Iberostar founty beach hotel. A very lovely resort. Great atmosphere, very friends staff, but especially with Fadwa who was very encouraging to assist! Our children took a shine to Fadwa & Bouchra along side most of the staff members who were very hospitable, great entertainer & so lovingly towards all the children. Our two both loved the childrens disco evenings learning the dance moves, great fun with Fadwa & Bouchra !! The food was good, French Moroccan mix, weather was lovely. We will recommend this resort to all our families & friends😍 & hopefully be back for more very soon.👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 June 2018,5,"Amazing hotel, should be a 5 star","I have just returned from a week spent at the Iberostar & from start to finish we had the most amazing week. Firstly the staff go above & beyond to make your stay special. Our room was on the ground floor pool view clean & spacious & a very comfy bed. Food was plenty with lots of choice, both in the buffet restaurant & the pool bar. The cocktails were beautiful & all drinks were branded. The A La Ca rte restaurant is a must! Would love to re-book.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 June 2018,4,Pete G,"Visited Iberostar for the first time to celebrate my 65th birthday what can I say from the time we arrived until we left couldn’t have had a better experience the room was beyond my expectations always clean and the little extra touches to celebrate my retirement was a big surprise, the food was great and varied if you couldn’t find something nice to eat I’m sorry go to the local McDonald’s (sad) the entertainment was good but maybe needed someone to fill in the gaps between each set but that said these guys worked very hard and are an asset to the team as you can tell I really enjoyed my stay. I have to say I have worked in the hotel trade for 35 years as a senior manager and all I can say is to your team and your hotel you’re a winner thank you for making my retirement so…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2018,5,My Favourite Hotel in Agadir,"This was the 4th time my family and I have stayed at the Iberostar in 3 years - I keep coming back due to the customer service from the staff, resort cleanliness and the quality of food. The hotel has just had a refurb and so we were expecting to see some big changes. The rooms, bar and and restaurant area have all been decorated although the bathroom in out room seemed to have been left untouched - Still fit for purpose but doesn't fit the overall theme of the room. The food is fantastic and there is lots to choose from - You can definitely have something different every day. There is some staples such as chips, pasta, salad and soup etc but they also need to cater for fussy eaters like kids. The staff here are second to none and I will be amazed if you find a team of…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 June 2018,5,Amazing pool staff !!!,"I really recommend this hotel, the location is good, very clean and helpful. the staff are very very friendly especially the pool staff Chef, Walid, Amine, Ismail And Faisal. Whilst in the pool Amine specially saved my life as well as Faisal and Ismail. I would definitely reccomend this hotel for families. The entertainment staff are also very sociable and friendly.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 May 2018,4,"Few teething issues, but overall very good value.","We went a few days after the re-opening. We booked the hotel independently, so we checked in, went to the room and saw we needed a safe key, so went back to reception, (we had requested a sea view room, so a long walk), then were told the key was a 100 dirham deposit, ok next door to another hotel, to get some cash out, as no ATM in this hotel. Got the key, went back to the room, but the safe was broken, So they came to take it away and we never saw it again! Then later that day, we asked for beach towels. No problem, but we need another 100 Dirham deposit each!! I got quite cross at this stage, and said, when we check in, tell us these things, especially as the ATM was a fair way and they charge you a fee per transaction. (Also if you wanted an Iron or a kettle, yep…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 April 2018,5,This ranks as one of the best!,"I loved this place. It has to be one of the best resorts I've ever stayed at. Remarkably, it's nothing special as far as luxury or amenities but it is so hospitable, so comfortable with exceptionally high levels of service with great choices and quality of food. Service staff are fantastic! I HIGHLY recommend this resort.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
 May 2018,4,Great holidau,"I spent a week in this hotel. The grounds were beautiful, the facilities were great, our room was satisfactory and the staff were beyond friendly and helpful. There are a few things that were less satisfying. Our room was rarely cleaned; the maids never took away rubbish and didn't restock shampoo or soap. There was no rubbish bin. Having said that, they made our bed and left a bottle of champagne a few times. Our electricity cut out when I was using the hair dryer. The food served was nice but very repetitive and there was a lack of meat offered. Over all it was a lovely stay, it was great value for money but I thought I'd mention a few things that could be improved.",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,

 May 2018,4,After the re-open,"We spent some days in the newly re-opened Iberostar Founty Beach Hotel. Our impressions are mixed. First, maybe the negatives. In the newly refurbished family room number 3036 had a huge dirt on the wall. The newly fitted wall bracket has its packaging still on. In the room there was no trash can (later replaced) and there was no toilet brush. The bathroom was not refurbished, so the toilet seat did not really create a trusting impression. At the terrace door, the locking mechanism was torn off, hanging in the air. The grassy part of the terrace was sprinkled with cigarette sticks. What was good was the food. Breakfast, lunch and dinner have a satisfactory choice and good quality. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The cleaning of the room is perfectly correct, the…",Iberostar_Founty_Beach,Agadir,
