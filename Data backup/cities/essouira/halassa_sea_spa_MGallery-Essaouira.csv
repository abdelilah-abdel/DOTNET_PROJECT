 January 2023,2,apple pay does not work at their till,"stopped for lunch at their seafront restaurant, asked if they did apple pay. told yes had a meal and went to pay, would not accept both my wife and i apple pay even though our phones got a payment tick. my wife then had to go back to our appt to get my debit card while i sat by payment till. watched other people trying to use apple pay and all had to revert to their debit cards."
 December 2022,3,Could be better,"The hotel is well placed along the beach front and only a 10-minute walk along the seafront into the old town, port and medina. The bedrooms are large and clean with nice terraces and the beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms have toiletries (shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion), but the paper handkerchiefs are so thin they disintegrate on touching moisture so take you own with you! The breakfast choices are very poor and are mostly sweet and Moroccan dishes and not International. Sadly lacking in savoury items and salted butter. Since I prefer a savoury breakfast, I found it very disappointing and lacking in choice apart from eggs, and tired looking cheese and spam. After a few days I considered going out for breakfast somewhere else to get some variety,…"
 December 2022,4,Absolutely wonderful stay...revitalizing and does what is says,"To start with, the location itself worth the steep price you will pay at the property. There are high chances you might be coming in by bus from Marrakech and it is situated at a 5-min walking distance (or 7MAD Taxi ride) from the Supratours terminal. Check-in was smooth but we had to wait for a while even when we had done the online check-in. As an ALL member, we were also given vouchers to drinks which we could redeem later. Coming to the rooms, I will suggest the sea-view rooms because they are a world in itself. Rooms are cozy and well-stocked. They play close attention to the minute details... stationery, welcome confectionery, explaining the various things to do in the property. Do remember, this is an old property so fixtures are not entirely modern. You could face…"
 December 2022,5,A lovely hotel and a fantastic location,"How to get to the hotel: You can either book a taxi directly with the hotel or get one from outside the airport for 200dh (the price is the same for both options). The weather: It was not dull or wet but a bit cold at night. The hotel: The hotel is very central, opposite the beach and about 5 to 10mn walk from the old medina and the port. They have a private that can only be used by the guests. It is a very clean and well maintained hotel and I can not fault it even if I tried to. The rooms: The rooms are big enough and you have a desk, a bed, TV, Kettle, a sage, Teas/Coffees but no iron, AC/Heating. The bed is comfortable enough and they give you spare blankets in case you feel cold at night. The balcony had a table and two chairs but I didn't use it. Bathroom: Very smart…"
 October 2022,5,Excellent hotel and friendly staff,"The hotel is really nice and in a great location, just opposite the beach and within walking distance of the medina. It's slightly dated, but if anything, this adds to it's charm. The staff were also very friendly and helpful, particularly Samira who sent some clothing back to England that I accidentalkly left in the wardrobe! The pool area has a good atmosphere and lots of space, and there'sd also the warmer indoor pool and the private beach area."
 October 2022,3,clean hotel but…,"We arrived at the hotel for one night. The location is good, the hotel is clean, the breakfast is good but it looks old and does not open the heart. If you have other options for a 5-star hotel in the area, then it's better מלון סביר באיזור לא מי יודע מה."
 October 2022,4,Review of the M Beach resturant,"We stayed two nights at the MGallery hotel, and found the accomodation clean and adequately maintained relative to a 10 night tour around Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat and the road of a 1000 kasbahs where we stayed in Xaluca branded resorts. After 7.00pm there was no bar or restaurant service in the hotel and so we were forced across the roasd to the M Beach restaurant. The food here was excellent but in general it appeared understaffed. it took more than 25 minutes to get a drink after being seated at the table. The staff were turning away non-residents as it appreared to be one of the smarter extablishments on the beach and so attracted passers by. On the first night we ate pizzas, wine and Flag Escpecial beer. On the second night we had penne aux gambas, and cotelets…"
 October 2022,5,Lovely friendly charm,"This hotel has a quaint charm and is right outside the medina. It is right on the beach and has a beautiful fish restaurant right on the beach and private beach area with great sun beds and umbrellas free of cost. This makes it a great location to visit Essaouria as you can walk into the medina in 10 minutes for shopping and restaurants. The staff are super friendly with a special call out to the lovely ladies on reception - Hasna and Nezha - who looked after me so well. The cleaning staff who work so hard and scrub that hotel from top to bottom every day! And also Younes on the beach who was super friendly but also so so kind to another lady who was with her disabled daughter. Younes helped get the girl on the beach, out of chair and on the sun bed. Every time. Without being…"
 September 2022,3,In need of updating,"Overall we had a nice stay at this hotel, but it is a very tired hotel in need of updating. Definitely not 5 star! Good points - the staff were all lovely and very helpful - the beach bar/restaurant was nicely located to watch the sunset and was reasonably prices. - enough loungers to go around (although we weren't there in high season) - great location for walking into the town Negative points - The hotel really needs refurbishment. All the doors in the bedroom were old and didn't fit properly. The bathroom was very dated and had awful drainage - the indoor ""spa"" was just plain weird. We were told you could book one hour a day entry to the spa, so we duly booked. On arrival it is just a small indoor pool with bubbles. The fountain in the corner wasn't working and there were…"
 September 2022,5,Excellent warm and friendly welcome to Essaouira,"We are currently staying at the hotel first floor overlooking the pool. From an initial warm and friendly welcome from reception staff quick check-in process and nice room. The breakfast staff are warm friendly attentive yet unobtrusive. Annabelle the general manageress is one of the best managers I have encountered travelling and an excellent example to her employer. We have tried the hotel spa a very pleasurable and again welcoming and friendly service. I have journeyed through Morocco several times and this is by far the best hotel experience I have had. A small technical problem with room equipment was dealt with quickly and efficiently and a room swap offered. I rarely recommend anything but certainly recommend this hotel for its warm friendly staff, amenities and…"
 September 2022,5,"Annabelle, the best General Manageress!","I’ve stayed here many times and my expectations are always exceeded. I have mentioned how good, attentive and lovely the staff are in my previous reviews and this time I want to write about the General Manageress, Annabelle. I have travelled a lot and stayed in hotels around the world and I have never come across such an amazing general manageress as Annabelle. She is present every day around the hotel, in the pool area and across the road at MBeach (the hotel’s beach restaurant). She always looks extremely smart and presentable and makes alot of effort with guests, remembering their names, asking how they are, solving any problems and generally being visible. Nothing is too much trouble for her and she leads by example. Accor/MGallery Hotels are lucky to have Annabelle, she is…"
 September 2022,3,Excellent hotel. Poorly managed breakfast,A clean luxury hotel. Breakfast bar although had good variety but poorly managed. No cups or glasses near drinks stations. Takes long time to fill empties. Not all bread is fresh. Location is perfect. Dinner so pricy compared to similar standard restaurants within minutes walk from it.
 August 2022,5,Best of stays,"Great stay of 3 nights in this beautiful hotel in which you feel at home right away! Amazing location, wonderful staff. Always with a smile and asking making sure guests are happy and taken care of.Great breakfast buffet. Rooms clean and with view over pool. Pool beautiful but cold…! Too cold for staying in very long especially since the city gets cool weather. Hotel has a lovely ‘library/lounge’ area where one can borrow books and leave your own behind if you are done reading them. Loved it! Did some (expensive) massages which were just meh. Nice but not worth the cost in my opinion. All in all lovely hotel and town, wish we could stay longer!"
 July 2022,3,Hotel in need of refurbishment,"Plus points first: The location is good and the staff were universally lovely. Polite, helpful and friendly. I must also mention the General Manager, Annabelle who was visible every day chatting to the guests and eager to solve any issues. This leadership sets the tone for the team and deserves praise. The food for breakfast was really good as was the food by the pool but the beach bar menu was uninteresting. The hotel itself is awaiting refurbishment that has been delayed for a couple of years due to Covid. It is looking grubby with loose plumbing fittings, chipped paint and wobbly cupboard doors etc which was disappointing. I do hope the refurbishment will progress soon to allow the hotel to continue to flourish."
 July 2022,5,Very nice hotel,"Nice rooms, good location, good service. Special thanks to Latifa for the terrific breakfast service. Large and clean rooms. Nice swimming pools. We will come back soon and recommend the hotel to our friends"
 July 2022,3,Mediocre,"There seems to be a trend with big hotels in Morocco. They must all have been built in the 80s and kt updated. This hotel is no different. The lobby and pool area are nice. We were lucky to have a view of the ocean and a balcony. The bed was nice and the furniture was good but the room needs to be repainted and the shower needs to be retiled. Overall, it was good - across from the beach and just a short walk to the medina. Breakfast was so-so. The service, however, was excellent. This has been consistent across all places we’ve stayed in Morocco. No matter how nice the hotel, the service is excellent."
 July 2022,1,Worst experience ever,"Rather than qualifying it as a 5 star hotel, it would be more correct to call it a big hostel. Great staff, very poor management..while staff is trying to do their best, management is not bothering to improve or renevate any outdated room or furnitures. Therefore employees are embarrassed due to poor condition of hotel. No iron board in the rooms, broken kettle, blocked sink and bath , sticky dishes at breakfast etch. Antz are all around the room. Stains on the walls , doors, and in the shower.. I never had such a unhappy experience in any hotel. We booked from ebooking but reception gave us better offer and We cancelled our ebooking reservation..it seems they are doing this to every customer.."
 June 2022,5,Favorite hotel in Morocco,"After traveling all over Morocco and stayed 8 different hotels, this is my favorite hotel. Stayed 2 nights. Sea view room. Pros: 1. First of all I must recognize the manager at the restaurant for breakfast (wish I knew his name). Excellent!! First breakfast, besides buffet, he suggested a basket of pastries, Moroccan crepe, cooked to order omelettes we like, cappuccino, regular coffee, etc. Next breakfast, he led us to the same table we sat and everything besides omlettes and coffee was on the table already for us. Without asking, he brought us the same freshly cooked omlettes and coffee we ordered yesterday. He was very attentive, friendly and professional. His service was superior than any other 5 star hotels. 2. Room: Sea view room was perfect. Obviously ocean front…"
 June 2022,3,something is missing?,"As a 5 star hotel at the resort they should consider the convenience of having 2 elevators on each end of the hall way so their guest doesn't have to walk the full length of the hall way to get to their rooms. Bathroom was large which have a full size of bath tube but the shower head wasn't position correctly & the glass enclosure couldn't keep the water from splashing out on the floor which could be a major drawback. The most disappointed area was their breakfast buffet, not just the food wasn't even 3 stars & all the wait staff have no clue what they're doing. The person in charge of the egg station couldn't know how to make sunny side up, scramble or omelette. None of them understand simple English and didn't even want to try. Total disaster !"
 May 2022,5,Great Service and great location,We stayed 1 night and we had great service from check-in to check-out. The staff were very accommodating especially Loubna and Hasna at the front desk. The bellman Abdelilah was polite and patient. We had the buffet style breakfast at the hotel restaurant which had many local elements along with a few European touches. The hotel is located right across the beach which has a beautiful paved walk way to take a stroll either day or night. I would stay here again and recommend this hotel.
 May 2022,5,Our favourite hotel,"We just love Le Médina hotel. It has the perfect location right opposite the beach and is just a 10-minute walk from the main square. There is always a warm welcome from Nezha and the team, so it's no wonder we go back time and time again. The rooms are large and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities and have a good size balcony. The pool and garden are fabulous. It is well worth opting for breakfast here as you get such a choice. Can't find anything bad to say about the place."
 April 2022,5,Perfect,This hotel is right on the beach front and 5 minute flat walk to the medina. The two pools are lovely one is an indoor heated pool! The beds are top class - big and very comfortable. The hotel is spotless and the staff are very helpful. We had an excellent 3 nights and we will definitely be back.
 March 2022,5,Le medina is the best,The best hotel in essaouira. Everything was perfect ! A big thanks to all the workers there it was an outstdanding experience. I hope to revisit this beutifeul place with all the kind and proffesional staff
 March 2022,5,"Stunning hotel, lovely location, excellent staff","We stayed here for two nights and had the best time - the hotel is the definition of luxury, and is ideally located on the beach which lends itself to fresh morning strolls and a nice walk back from the Médina in the evening."
 March 2022,5,Staying a le madina hotel,"It’s really feels like home in le medina hotel , other than property and facilities being nice but more important it is the staff and how friendly and hopefully the are keep me coming back , Many thanks to Ms Nezha front office manger and Ms hassna and ms loubna and Mr abdessamad from concierge and House keeping team Thank you le medina hotel see you next time ❤️"
 November 2021,5,Great hotel in Essaouira!,"The staff at Le Medina are very welcoming and all the staff made me feel like home! The hotel itself is very beautiful and the interior is very unique. Everywhere you look inside, you will find some interior design details. The hotel has a stunning pool where you can enjoy the sun and relax in one of the sunbeds. The breakfast was delicious and the rooms very spacious and clean with an awesome ocean view! The food at dinner was also great, I had a delicious plate of salmon. Can strongly recommend to stay at Le Medina during your stay in Essaouira with an unbeatable location. Thanks for having me and I would be black to come back again!"
 October 2021,3,Essaouira,"The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Great location, nice view over the ocean. The hotel needs to be refurbished especially the rooms. The breakfast buffet could also be improved with variety of food. Overall decent value for money"
 September 2021,2,A holiday ruined by deception,"This was our second visit to the hotel, having enjoyed a wonderful time there last year, on our honeymoon. The main reason we wanted to return, were the lovely pool area together with the spa facilities. Unfortunately when we arrived at the reception, we were shocked to see the whole pool and outside area being boarded over. It seems that the hotel was the venue for a major sporting reception scheduled for a few days time. The hotel knew this but chose not to inform us, therefore denying us the opportunity to make an alternative booking elsewhere. They have a sister hotel also in the same city but made no offer to move us there. They should have at least informed us in advance then either offered the chance to cancel, or offered a financial reduction or alternatively offered…"
 September 2021,3,Unbearably HOT rooms,"Nice hotel in great location. Beautiful property. Walking distance to everything. Lovely beach view. Sadly, the air conditioners weren’t working in any of the rooms. The problem I had was they LIED and said it was and it was fixed. We and many there n our group changed rooms but the new rooms were hot with no working air. There was another tour group there hat had the same issues. Nice restaurant n property. The front desk will exchange foreign money for you. If it’s cool out I would recommend staying here. If you plan on staying during hot months be prepared for stifling heat in the rooms. Without the air problems I would have rated the hotel somewhere between good and excellent"
 September 2021,3,More 4 star than 5 star,"This is the second time on this trip that we have stayed at an Mgallery hotel and it ie definitely the last time we spent two nights in this property and prior to arriving were planning to extend to seven nights but left at the earliest opportunity. The hotel is in a good location and presents in a combination Moroccan / beachfront style, thereafter it’s all downhill check in and out was efficient but not very friendly ,baggage and parking service was decidedly unfriendly. The room (151) was spacious and clean with no facilities whatsoever other than good connectivity and TV . Sleep quality was adequate as was A/c .The bathroom was antiquated and needs renovating , toiletries were pleasant but towels were of the use to be white variety as per a previous 4 star Mgallery…"
 September 2021,4,Great restful quality sea side hotel,Well we just had a great three days here great position for shouk and the harbour really friendly and caring staff yes it is a little bit worn but still excellent stones throw to the beach we had a beach view room really great they have a restaurant over the road we dined there very good food good friendly service top class breakfast menu and a very well run breakfast restaurant so helpful always had 5 minutes to spend my wife & I who are learning Arabic if you stay here get a room 2nd floor beach view free car parking lovely pool so relaxing because of Covid this place is very quite it deserves to do more business see you again Definitely
 August 2021,5,Good place,"Nice and comfortable hotel,very beautiful vew, nice stuff, especially waiter Khalid Rashid, I felt like at home there. Food also was so delicious. Thank you that you made my trip unforgettable! Hope to visit this hotel another time"
 August 2021,3,High time to be renewed,"The staff in general is really nice. The location is great. Breakfast is various. However, the rooms are too old, dirty, dusty, spiders’ nets are all over, sofas torn, balcony’s floor extremely dirty. I wouldn’t consider it as a 5 star hotel."
 August 2021,5,Charming stay,I had the opportunity to have a stay at the Medina Essaouira and I’m grateful because the service and the food were gorgious. I’m happy to say that the Medina met my expectations during the whole week and I would like to thank Madame Loubna for her kindness ! I’ll be back in this charming place :)
 August 2021,1,like a nightmare,"this hotel really does not deserve being a member of Accor group. Room is terrible, outdated and not tidy breakfast was disaster looks like inside was not cleaned ages. i have requested reception to book for me a table on the beach resturant which belongs to the hotel , and when i went there the manager told me not yet booked and he can do his best find a table for me outside then i got crazy and left there without having meal . i and my wife had have our dinner on the balcony with hamburger and Cesar salad .Although i nooked for two nights stayed one night went back yo Marrakech. Girls at the reception did their best during my stay however rest of the staff looks like they are forced to do work or doing without salary."
 August 2021,5,Overall a great place for a family stay,"The hotels location is ideal for all kind of families. There are fantastic surf lessons you can take right in front of the hotel, a 10 minute walk to the Medina, a 15 minute walk to the port, close to several nice city sky bars. Just fantastic. The hotel itself offers great customer service and good food. The view is also absolutely amazing from from the sea side rooms."
 July 2021,3,Needs a refresher.,"Unfortunately this property fell a little flat for my wife and I. We were in country celebrating my wife's 50th birthday. We wanted a higher end property on the beach in Essaouira. The online pictures look wonderful and the hotel had decent ratings. I will say upon arrival the Front Desk Staff was wonderful. The woman at the front desk remained committed to trying to make our stay as nice as possible, but I believe these items were out of her control. Walking around various areas of the hotel it looked a little unkempt. Leaves and bird feathers in the passageways. Various areas dusty. Upon arrival to our room the room felt very ""dated"". Definitely time for a refresh. I understand the style the hotel is going for, but there was furniture with torn material, A/C did not seem to…"
 June 2021,5,Amazing,"the hotel has a Great océan view ; the staff is always around to help you and the food is just amazing at the beach restaurant in front of the hotel , the city is windy so it may be unpleaseant for some people but in general the atmosphere and the vibes are worth it"
 June 2021,5,Charming stay in a charming place,"I had a pleasant stay in a hotel in which we can easily feel at home. The location is excellent, near the old city and in front of the beach. Moreover, the service was extremely reactive to my demands and it made my stay enjoyable."
 May 2021,3,Very Old property but nice staff,"Great staff and well located (close to old medina, beach, and port), but the property is very old and need urgent refurbishment to maintain the 5 stars standard. Believe that prices are bit high comparing with hotel property standard. With critical COVID-19, trust that situation is not helping for big investment but this need to be planned to avoid destroying the brand."
 April 2021,5,Very nice stay :),"Very nice stay with all what you need despite the circumstances. Thanks to Ayoub for his warm welcome, help and guidance. The stay was very pleasant and comfortable. The staff was very polite and helpful, the location was very convenient for getting around. If we were to travel to Essaouira again, we would definitely stay there again!"
 August 2020,5,Best vocation ever <3,I still remember every small detail about my last trip to essaouira due to this amazing hotel the service was so good everything you're asking about is available in your hands at the same second thank you Le Medina for making those days wonderful and let them stuck on my mind I can't wait to come again . P.S:I forgot mention that I saw the best views and the most amazing sunset in my whole life glad to this hotel <3
 February 2021,1,I can’t believe MGallery put their name to this hotel,Such an old and dated hotel with poor customer service from the reception team. Hygiene at breakfast was also not good considering the current Covid situation - it was a help yourself buffet but people were not wearing masks or gloves including the lady cooking pancakes. We were due to stay two nights but checked out early and moved to another hotel
 December 2020,5,Great service at a beautiful hotel,"Wonderful experience as usual. Hotel is clean in a perfect location, with a great service. Special thanks to Hafsa, Nezha, and Latifa. You always know how to treat your customers See you soon again. <3"
 October 2020,5,"Great hotel, convenient location","My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a four day holiday weekend. It was our second time staying at the hotel, but our first time back in Essaouira since the start of the pandemic. I felt perfectly safe staying here. I was pleased to see that the hotel was closely following sanitary and social distancing measures. The hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming. Since the hotel was not very full, we were given a complimentary upgrade to a larger room with a big terrace. The breakfast at the hotel was nice, and the best part was the made-to-order eggs and omelettes. The fresh crepes were delicious as well. The hotel is conveniently located just a few minutes walk to the medina, and right across the street from the beach. I really liked that there is a private beach club area…"
 November 2020,5,Great place to stay,Very nice and clean!!! The staff was amazing from the security guys out front to Mohammed at the front desk. They definitely made our stay enjoyable and will definitely be coming back!! I would recommend it to everyone 😍
 July 2020,5,Great stay & service,Excellent hotel location with a private beach across the road. Friendly front desk staff. Service is ok. Nice breakfast served to the table. Social distancing well respected as well . Only one option for dinner due to Corona and its a bit expensive
 July 2020,5,Unforgettable experience,"I'm out of words...it was an experience I will never forget. From the amazing guest service to the perfect location of the hotel, I would say they deserve their 5 star rating. My wife and I went during phase 2 of Covid19 (which they handled perfectly) and here's what we have to say: The hotel and its rooms have an antique vibe which I noticed was matching the city antiquity. Breakfast was amazing; there were plenty of options and enough food to eat your fill. The spa was incredibly relaxing and such an unforgettable experience, the pool was cleaned frequently and there was a solarium with beds above the pool for those who wanted to tan away from the water. As for reception, room service, chefs, beach and poolside services, hats off to their outstanding performances. Any…"
 July 2020,5,"Excellent service and location, extra care give to ensure a safe stay.","I stayed shortly after Morocco lifted its COVID-19 lockdown. The was pleased to see the hotel was genuinely concerned for its guest’s safety. Masks were required on premise by all and worn by employees at all time. Plenty of hand sanitizer was available. Although the mask aspect was required the hotel handled it well. At dinner you would go to the restaurant with your mask on, waiter would seat you at a socially distanced table. Then you could remove your mask to eat or drink. All in all, the best option under the current circumstances. The pool area was well kept, and since occupancy was low no problem with distancing yourself around the edge. The hotel was nowhere near occupancy level, but it felt fine to be there. It is an older hotel although it is well kept, and my…"
 February 2020,4,Excellent Hotel,"I went to Le Médina Hôtel Thalassa Sea & Spa Essaouira in early February this year for a week. It is a very nice, relaxing hotel. The hotel is very high quality with great staff and the food is delicious. It is also 5 minutes walk from the city and the port where the best restaurant is located, where you can choose what you want to eat from the catch of the day. Everything is negotiable"
 March 2020,5,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here a week. from the 'hardware'point, you can see that this hotel needs some renovation in the hotelrooms. A bit more modern would be fine. Personal is very friendly. A special thanks to mrs.LATIFA. She serves breakfast with a senior smile and actually she sees more than all the staff together !! (a lot of managers here in the morning.) They could be far more active in cleaning tables en paying attention to the quests. The hotel has a GREAT and wonderful pool with great bed ( also in the rooms). The bar is fine but what a pitty it is allowed to smoke INSIDE this bar!!! Come on guys, its 2020!!! Another odd thing: there are bicycles outside the hotel so a lot of people won't to rent them. BUT ITS ONLY DECORATION !!. Please take them away or PLEASE start renting BIKES…"
 March 2020,5,Quality of service @ the Restaurant MBeach,I was absolutely amazed by the art of welcoming that the Mgallery Lemedina has. The service was beyond my expectations throughout the smile of each individual at the restaurant and high standards of the service. Thank you Abdellah for your connectivity and your emotional touch. Certainly i will come back !!!
 February 2020,4,Nice place,"I stayed here with friends for 4 nights at end of February,and overall it was a pleasant stay.the rooms are comfortable,the room cleaning and daily water and cakes etc is very nice,this end of service was wonderful.as were the door staff-friendly,courteous,always nice.the pool is quite large and a good number of comfortable sun beds around it.breakfast was ok-not 5 star,but acceptable.the location is great,just across the road from beach,a short walk to the Médina.my only problem was in my limited interaction with reception staff-I had a problem with droughts coming through balcony door,and I was told all the rooms are the same.not the response I had hoped for ,nevertheless I would stay here again,as it is a lovely place overall."
 February 2020,4,A good hotel within easy reach of beach and Medina,We stayed for 10 days. The hotel is clean and comfortable and right on the beach. Only about 8 minutes walk from the Medina and the harbour which is a working fishing harbour and fascinating to see. Plenty of local restaurants within a short walk. I gave it 4 not 5 stars as I think the dinners were expensive.
 February 2020,4,A really nice welcome,"The most memorable thing about this hotel is the warmth of all the staff, from reception to dining room, beach bar to room staff and bell boys. Without exception everyone made our stay memorable. Having said that I don’t think the hotel is quite up to the advertised 5 star rating. Dining room furniture ready for a refurbishment and the rooms looking ever so slightly tired. That said our stay was a most comfortable one, albeit that the air conditioning in room was questionable effective. Great location. Do pay for a sea view as the other rooms don’t perhaps get much sun and have simply a view of the pool. We think the first floor sea view balconies have more room but the second floor perhaps less noisy. We went out of season in February. The advertised restaurants weren’t all…"
 February 2020,5,Seaside delight,"Excellent location by the beach with a good choice of meals, lovely pool, room and facilities within a five minute walk of the Medina, Fort, Soukh and Port. All staff members were friendly, welcoming and attentive. We had an enjoyable, relaxing week with no cares."
 February 2020,3,Not what was expected,We love Morroco on the whole and generally stay at a Spa resort. Thalassa are preferred but the Essaouira one is poor compared tzo the Agadir Spa. The resistance water is not present and only one relaxing water massage is working. Our usual treatment is very exspensive compared to other Thalassa Spa's. We generally have 3 sessions a week however not this time. We found other places in Essaouira. The Hotel itself is a nice place to stay and consider staying again.
 January 2020,4,Top hotel for Essaouira,"We spent 3 nights here and enjoyed the comfort of a lovely first floor room with balcony overlooking the excellent pool. Breakfasts were plentiful and varied although the egg chefs could use of lesson in cooking fried eggs. The hotel is well situated near enough to the medina and the lovely beach, while the beach front bar is a great place to watch the sunset with a drink."
 January 2020,5,Fabulous hotel,Comfortable hotel with a superb location. Only regret was not booking a sea view room. Breakfast was plentiful and we requested espresso coffee. fresh juices and pancakes available to order and such a pleasure sitting by the pool in the sun.
 November 2019,4,Perfect location,"This hotel was a delight. It is located across the road from the beach. Unfortunately, to get a seaview room, it's a $40 upgrade per night. We stayed with our pool view room. The room was clean and spacious. The balcony was big enough but all the balconies were in one long row with no privacy screens. Not really a big deal but worth noting if you want to sit outside. The outdoor pool was really cold and the heated indoor pool didn't open until the evening. Breakfast was good. The best part of this hotel is the location. It's about a 10 minute walk to the medina. Shops and bargains abound there. The waterfront is fascinating. The blue fishing boats are all tied up together and make a wonderful photo. The ramparts are great to walk along and see the waves crashing…"
 January 2020,5,Smart Moroccan choice..,stylish and welcoming. Good breakfast.. Next to private beach is a bonus .. great service Nice little balconies to watch the sunset. Very close to the Medina.. Just a five minute stroll away.. Beds are comfy
 January 2020,5,Perfect Location,Very close by walk to the port & all the restaurants (on the right side) Beach front just by crossing the street Very cozy hotel & I highly recomment it for couples and families My stay was too short & I couldn't test the spa but the prices seemed high comparing to Marrakesh & Casablance Welcoming staff very professional Rooms not that big but mattress comfortable.
 January 2020,1,Booked hotel through TripAdvisor,Booked hotel through TripAdvisor and paid. I then get a email saying hotel is full now. Very disappointed not to be staying here now. First time booking direct with TripAdvisor through website. Not happy.
 December 2019,4,Great Location in Essaouira,"The hotel is conveniently located in Essaouira across the street from the ocean and a couple of blocks from the Medina. The hotel lobby and common areas are modern and decorated in a Miami vibe....colorful, ""beachy"" and hip. The room was a bit of a disappointment considering the lobby was so modern. The room needed to be updated. It was clean and comfortable, just out of date."
 January 2020,4,Great base for exploring Essaouira!,"Just outside of the medina walls, you really couldn't ask for a better location. Rooms were larger with a desk area in them. Beds are extremely comfortable (best of all 3 hotels on our trip). The breakfast is great. It was located across a quiet street from the beach. Lovely 5-7 minute walk to the port in the early morning to see the boats unload their catches from the night before. The pool area was perfect (although we didn't get to use it) and service a 10. Wouldn't hesitate to go there again. Oh, and we were there for New Year's Eve - do not miss the hotel party (it was amazing with a Moroccan band and dancers, etc) and the Essaouira fireworks are launched from the beach right outside the front of the hotel."
 December 2019,4,Nice hotel,"This hotel is very fancy and offers a great base for exploring Essaouira as it lies just outside of the medina and almost on the beach. The pool and surroundings are wonderful and the rooms are also really nice. Breakfast is good too. It is also very international and you may for a moment forget which country you are in. But some like it that way. Personally I like more ""local"" boutique hotels, but clearly this is not a bad hotel at all and they do deserve much praise."
 December 2019,5,Top class hospitality!,"Located just in short walking distance from old Medina, equipped with everything you need to spend your free time the way you can only imagine: gym, 2 swimming pools ( indoor and outdoor), hamam and spa, private beach, restaurants offering variety of healthy meals, animations, cooking classes! They offer also excursions to different cities in Morocco as well as guided tours in Essaouira. Here you will feel welcomed and experience Moroccan hospitality at its best. The New Years Eve party was stunning with lots of attractions and attention to details supervised directly by hotel’s General Manager who is always there for you. The amazing, seductive menu has been prepared by the best Chef!"
 December 2019,4,"Lovely hotel,","Wonderful housekeeping, bar and restaurant a bit of a disaster and the outdoor pool wasn't heated. Cocktails ordered on Christmas day had to be returned and exchanged for beer and wine ( which was undrinkable), food spectacularly overpriced and very average at best. The Bloody Mary I ordered had a splash of vodka with tomato juice, and my partner's Margarita was just lemon and tequila... We are not overly difficult to please, but please do not have cocktails on a menu if nobody knows how to make them, especially on Christmas day when hotel is full of Westerners. Equally, beach restaurant is quite basic. Lovely location, lots of great restaurants around this hotel, door staff very helpful and friendly. I would stay here again, but dine out as it's not worth the disappointment."
 December 2019,2,"An ageing hotel, definitely not 5 stars, but with friendly staff","Pluses: - Good location, right in front of the ocean and a short walk away from Essaouira's Medina - Good breakfast, which we found even better than the Moevenpick Marrakech in which we stayed a couple of days before going to Essaouira - A really friendly staff, eg Naima, the msemen lady Minuses: - Hotel badly needs complete renovation works from floor to ceiling. Beyond the lobby area which they try to keep in the right shape, you'll easily see quite obvious signs of age which are *unacceptable* in a 5-star hotel. Damaged walls, paint jobs needed virtually everywhere, tile joints no longer there, interior designs dating from the 90's. SHAME on you Accor. - Hotel calls itself Spa / Thalassotherapie. When you arrive, you'll see that access to the (basic & old) spa facilities…"
 December 2019,4,Great hotel,Great hotel in a perfect spot. We booked this hotel on the beach instead of a riad in Essaouria & are glad we did. The Medina becomes a bit much after a while & was nice to chill out. Good pool & room overlooking the beach.
 November 2019,4,Perfect Winter escape...,"Having not had a vacation for majority of the year due to work, I really wanted some time away and knew exactly the place I wanted to go… Essaouira, and in particular the Le Medina Hotel. I have visited Essaouira over many years and always go back to the Le Medina Hotel when I want a little escape. The location is perfect. Less than 5-minute walk to Medina, 10-minute walk to the beach bars and just a hop skip and a jump over the road to the beach. As for the hotel itself, the service that I receive from all the staff, never fails to amaze me. Having spent 4 days in the hustle and bustle of Marrakech I arrived at the Le Medina hotel mid-afternoon and was greeted by the friendly concierge team and the super reception team Ayoub, Fatima, Karima and Amine who throughout my stay…"
 December 2019,3,Disappointed that the indoor heated pool was closed,"Overall we had a nice stay. The rooms are big, the bed is very comfortable, and the balcony was great. Good location - just a 5 min walk from the Medina. Just across the road from the beach. The beach bar which is part of the hotel is great, and we also liked the hotel bar inside the hotel too. Plenty of double beds pool side, and a solariam suntrap. Sadly we didn't realise that the indoor heated pool was going to be closing when we were there. We were there for 4 nights - nothing was said at time of booking, or when we checked in. We only found out on day 2 that the pool/hammam would then be closed for rest of our stay for planned refurbishment. Disappointing that we didn't know this when booking as the heated pool and hammam was the reason for choosing this hotel given that we…"
 October 2019,4,Very welcoming hotel,"We stayed here for 6 nights We requested a high floor room with sunny south facing,and that is just what we got excellent We had some meals at the hotel in the evening and they were all very good. The bar area was relaxing with great staff The only downside to the hotel was with the breakfast.When it was quiet all worked well but one day it was extremely busy and they were a bit slow in replenishing the items. The hotel is in a great position with a private beach area which we used. There is a hotel restaurant on the beach which we used 1 night but not too impressed with the wait between courses and there semed to be other diners complaining so perhaps just a bad night for them"
 November 2019,5,Amazing!!,"This is my first visit to Le Medina in Essaouira as a holiday. The service is incredible, from the reception, to All the food staff, the most lovely, helpful and hardworking people that you could meet. Thank you for your service."
 October 2019,3,A mixed bag,"It feel somewhat harsh to leave a three star review but there were a number of aspects to our stay which really were below par. Many of the staff were fantastic but, on the main, they were standoffish and gave the impression customers were an inconvenience. This relates particularly to the reception and bar staff who were borderline rude. All of the breakfast team were lovely and so accommodating, bringing my son bananas when we couldn’t find any and making us proper coffees to avoid the terrible filter stuff they were serving. The worst service by far can be found at the beach, including the restaurant and bar where service was painfully slow. The food was pretty good but took an age to come. It is a beautiful spot so we went most days in spite of the service. Rooms were…"
 November 2019,5,The greatest holiday,"Absolutely wonderfull hôtel, clean and relax place It was a Nice greeting, the staff was very friendly and helpful , you feel immediately at home i wish could have stay there for longer. Many thanks to all team spécial to division room manager loubna I'll back for sure next year. See you soon."
 October 2019,4,"First Class Hotel, but an issue with billing","This is a very nice hotel with a terrific lobby, which flows easily into the different areas around it, including a full-service bar, a fun fashion area, terrific furnishings, a restaurant and a large pool area. The rooms are comfortable and have balconies. The staff is professional and helpful. This is a first-class place. In addition, the hotel has a restaurant and an area to sit on chairs at the beach—very nice. One thing you should know is that on my bill when checking out I experienced what is called “Dynamic Currency Conversion,” despite asking that the bill be in dirhams. This process involves the hotel charging you a conversion fee from dirhams to dollars and then using an exchange rate mandated by the hotel. In my opinion the hotel is not treating the guests fairly,…"
 October 2019,5,THE place to stay in Esssouira,"Clean, nice, perfectly located with a private beach right in front. Just a few minutes from all that Essaouira has to offer so you’re close but not bothered by it all. Pool is wow, pub is nice abd rooms are quiet and spacious. Ocean view is a plus!"
 October 2019,5,Perfect for vacation,Great hotel the staff is very friendly and welcoming. Food is very good and the location is close to the Médina. The boardwalk is just in front of the hotel. Rooms are large with small lovely balconies.
 October 2019,4,Dinner was wonderful and staff were the best!,"We had Dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and we had the best staff to look after us. The food was wonderful and I highly recommend this hotel. The staff who looked after us Nour Eddine; Mustapha; Khalide,Husnaa all should be congratulated and if I was their boss I would be proud to have these employees and should promote them. Wonderful Food, Ambiance and Staff."
 October 2019,4,"So close to everything, ideal location","When you plan to visit any city there are so many choices of hotels to chose from. Hotel Le Médina is an ideal choice. Across the road from the sandy beach , a restaurant on the beach, a short stroll to the Médina and fishing port. Be surprised by the magnificent pool and fabulous food offered within the restaurant. Rooms are large and offer everything you need for a short or long stay. You will enjoy everyday of your stay either sightseeing or enjoying the pool or beach . Two days is a minimum. Do not miss the breakfast buffet."
 October 2019,5,A perfect stay in Essaouira,"Our stay was perfect from the beginning to the end. Parking: free parking on the street next to the hotel, very easy. Room: room was big, clean with a balcony and a pool view. Breakfast: one of the best buffet breakfast I’ve had, a lot of choices, I really liked the juice bar. We sat outside by the pool which was lovely. All the staff was very nice, amazing stay, thank you!"
 October 2019,5,Perfect spot to relax and take in the beach,"We topped off a two week tour of Morocco with 4 days in Essaouira and found this hotel to be perfect. Right on the beach with a 10 min walk to the Medina this hotel gave us all we needed. Many of our group enjoyed the spa treatments, including the Hammam. Our rooms were oceanside and I could hear the waves crashing on the shore as I fell to sleep! The morning buffet was the best we saw on our trip, and health focused. I loved the golden milk and juice bar!"
 October 2019,5,Nice hotel close to very nice city,"We did like the stay in Essaouira, maybe the swimming pool could be a little bit hotter as the ocean was cold and weather windy, but hot spa did compensated that very well in the evening. Room, breakfest, service all that was very good."
 October 2019,4,"Sun, sea and soft breezes","Book early enough and there are some great deals at the Hotel Medina. The hotel occupies a commanding position on the seafront at Essaouira, walking distance to the souk and harbour to the right and some really nice restaurants to the left. We booked a decent sized en suite double room for three days in October for £168 which is under £60 a night. Friends told me they paid £80 per night on another occasion. The room didn't have much of a view although you could see the sea if you leaned out over the balcony. And the plumbing could do with an upgrade - a shower fitting fell off the wall - but the bed was big and comfy and the water always piping hot. Breakfast was extra - £10 per head - with a good selection of fresh fruit and breads and you could have your eggs cooked whatever…"
 September 2019,3,Bordering on scruffy 2 star,"This hotel is in dire need of investment. Decor is tired and staff, although very pleasant, need training. Restaurant service is slow, even when they have meat! Americano coffee is good but avoid the tasteless filter coffee at breakfast."
 September 2019,3,"great reception and bed, bad food, awful bathrooms","All the stars are for the hospitality of the reception staff, like hasna. Very nice, informative, polite. Loved her (and others were good too). Bellman also nice and smiling. Restaurant staff very nice as well. Loved the customer service. Goods: bed comfortable, large room, good pool view. Safe, fridge, AC, toiletries. Location was good. Breakfast servers were good. Breakfast food options were good too. Coffee, juice, mint tea, eggs, bread, croissants etc. Had breakfast here all 3 days. 150 dirhams. Room for improvement: 1) bathroom/shower in room 153 and 255 both are horrible. First room was 153: shower was fine, then all of a sudden got boiling hot, then freezing cold. Tried changing nozzles, and water automatically would go from hot to cold, and intermittently okay. So I…"
 September 2019,3,"Reasonably good, but a few niggles...","This is a big hotel overlooking the beach just a short walk from the Medina. Bright and modern with a big swimming pool and great sun loungers, well sheltered from the relentless wind. Overall we had a good stay but we did have a few niggles. On arrival we were welcomed and told that our room would be ready at 2.00pm (it was 1:15pm) and that mint tea would be served straightaway to enjoy while we waited. We spent the next 15 minutes going through stuff with the travel agent – no tea arrived. He then left and we just sat there. After 25 minutes and still no mint tea I went to reception to ask, she said it would be served immediately. I sat down again, looking at a big TV screen telling us how L’Accor Hotels make you feel welcome. We weren’t feeling very welcome. By…"
 September 2019,5,Fantastic stay,"Bit pricey but worthwhile. Beautifully decorated hotel with amazing pool, terraces / solarium and other amenities. Only thing that lets down slightly is the service by the waiting staff which was lacklustre."
 September 2019,5,Amazing Stay at Le Medina MGallery,"We arrived to Essaouira for leisure and we decided to stay at MGallery based on recommendation from previous travelers. I usually travel with large groups of people from the US, and I was impressed with how fast check in was at the lobby. The reception team made sure everything was taken care of, which they did an incredible job assuring such a great customer service. I had a wedding anniversary in my group and they made it look as a life time souvenir. Special thanks to the reception team who made everything in their power to make our stay wonderful, namely Nezha, Ayoub, Rabiaa, Karima and Hasane."
 September 2019,5,Excellent stay,"Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel, I booked it as a little treat at the end of a 2-weeks holiday in Morocco and Accor gave me a great deal as a member. The location couldn’t be better, right by the beach very close to the Medina. Check in was personal and I was given mint tea to pass the 15 minutes wait for the room to be ready. The room itself was very nice indeed, quite large with a good balcony. It had everything I could possibly need for a short stay. The bed was simply divine, huge and comfortable, bedding excellent. Bathroom was beautiful and of a good size, selection of toiletries available. WC separate, which I like, even when I’m on my own. Bar service was good and they offered some nice cocktails, breakfast was also good but disorganisation was evident within the…"
 September 2019,3,More like 3 star,The guys at the entrance are very friendly always asking how you’re doing. But everyone else working inside the hotel doesn’t greet you or anything. It seemed to be if your English your ignored but if your french you get the 5 star treatment. Reception staff claim they speak good English but didn’t know what a jacuzzi was when I asked were it was. It states they have a jacuzzi but we was told they don’t have one once there. This wasn’t the only lie about the hotel. The hotel is not on the beach it’s across the road. The salt water pool is only in use from the times of 19.00-21.00 which is ridiculous as most restaurants open for food at 19.00. There was no pool service and no one at the pool bar all week. A cocktail and Jameson’s and coke cost £26. Didn’t see anyone drinking at…
 September 2019,3,"Lovely hotel, Average service","This hotel is in a perfect location for the beach front and market although the ‘private beach’ as stated on the site is not so much private. The pool is great but the ‘pool side bar’ was not open once in the week that we stayed. The spa was very well presented and we enjoyed a hamman massage but the salt pool was only open from 7pm-9pm which was not very practical for us and would have been nice earlier on in the day time. Rooms were quiet and comfortable with everything you could need! Staff however were not very friendly and slightly unorganised when it came to serving at meal times or sorting things out at the reception. The breakfast was average and although we did not eat dinner in the hotel itself, we ate at their beach bar a few times and the food was delicious! I would…"
 August 2019,4,"location,location,location","picked this hotel for its proximity to walled town and was not disappointed.The hotel is right on seafront and all common areas are of a 5 star standard,great pool although a little cold,great breakfast and amazing friendly staff.The room could of done with a little upgrading,our shower leaked and had to use towels to dry floor,although they came in to do evening turn down and replaced these on all but 1 of our 4 nights,beds were comfortable with good quality linens and room was well cleaned.Pool beds were some of the largest we have had and very comfy for relaxing in the sun.would stay here again"
 September 2019,4,Great Location,"We chose this hotel as a loyal Accor member. It is the best located hotel, on a corner and overlooking the promenade and ocean. A five Minute walk to the Medina. We booked a junior suite and upgraded to an executive suite. It was two rooms and had windows overlooking the pool. The decor is traditional Moroccan which we wanted. Big and well appointed bathroom, walk in robe. Breakfast is adequate. This is the place to stay in Essaouira. Plenty of places to eat on the promenade if you don’t want to eat in the hotel. The hotel also has its own beach club on the beach!"
 September 2019,5,Autumn Holiday,"A delightful hotel, quirky but an excellent position with its own beach and close proximity to the Medina which is so friendly and bustly at any time of day. Book a superior sea view room they face south so lovely evening sunshine and so much to watch, spacious rooms, excellent bathroom, beds are HUGE. Food is good especially the breakfast buffet. Staff the most courteous and friendly we have met in a long time. General decor - well not a standard Hilton or ther chain, needs a little TLC bu to be honest it was delightful. A must for anyone considering Morocco, and we would recommend it very highly."
 August 2019,5,MGallery - Great spot,"Loved this place. Wahda and the staff are great and super friendly. Relaxing there on the couches watching the action on the broadwalk and the sunset, has been the perfect way to end the day and start the evening."
 September 2019,5,Perfect place to stay in Essaouira,"My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel for 3 nights. This was our first stop in Morocco so we intentionally wanted a place that would allow us to acclimate. The staff was extremely helpful, spoke both English and French, and took great care of us. The front desk gave us a lot of tips about the area and handled reservations to excursions for us. One recommendation: definitely do the breakfast! We were pleased with the service, variety and quality of food. As Americans we tend to be a little careful trying food when we travel outside of the country — we happily enjoyed the eggs, fresh yogurt, local fruit and many other dishes without an issue. We saw a few reviews about the rooms being a bit outdated before we came. We didn’t feel bothered by this in the slightest. I…"
 August 2019,5,Best hotel in Essaouira,"I have stayed here many times and cannot fault anything. Five star service, amazing, helpful and caring staff, beautiful bedrooms and pool area. Breakfast is excellent. Something I particularly enjoyed was listening to the musician Simo Khzami who played his set live in the bar each evening (however when I visited last week he wasn’t playing 🙁) The Hotel is in a great location, a few steps from the medina and opposite the beach."
 August 2019,5,Great place,"Thank you so much To the team of le medina hotel i spend a such great time there in spa, pool and the breakfast was so delicious special thanks to reception staff and Loubna with her kindness and smile. I’ll back definitely 🥰🥰"
 July 2019,5,Week-end,It was amazing choice to stay in this hotel The staff was wonderful and very welcoming From the parcking to the entrance if i could remember the names Mohamed ibrahim and abdsamad Thank you to hasna nezha karima kenza from the reception From houskeeping: soumia and leila f&b manager mly and from breakfast team aziz and hicham Thank you so much team I will definitely come back
 June 2019,5,"Comfortable hotel, great location","Nicely appointed hotel. We had sea view suite which was spacious, full bathroom plus an extra loo! Balcony small but appreciated for the view to the beach. There is a road between hotel and beach. The hotel’s beach area is great, v helpful staff who are happy to arrange sofas and cushions etc to suit. Location is fab for the Médina, Fishing port and restaurants."
 July 2019,5,Excellent and relaxing stay,"I came with my family for holiday to escape the stress of work and have really enjoyed my stay with you not only me but the whole family. People were so attentive to our needs starting the reception to the restaurant and housekeeping From the reception I thank hasna, nezha kenza and karima who were there to provide all information to made our stay more comfortable. The check in as the check out were smooth and quick I also appreciate the attention provided by the breakfast team ( Mly the F&B manager , aziz, hicham, abdessamad, khalid, anouar 1 et anouar 2, the cassiers maryem and fatim zahra) . On just one day they memorised our preferences. Also i appreciate the effort employed by the houskeeping, soumia who stayed in touch with me whole time to be sure that i don't need…"
 July 2019,5,Windsurfing and relaxing- best kind of a family holiday!,"Thank you so much for a lovely stay. We enjoyed windsurfing and the best service at your hotel. A great thanks to Karina Nezha for the best service and availability with helping us with all kinds of stuff (transport, guide, connection hotel in marracech, restaurants etc)."
 July 2019,5,Beautiful hotel and friendly staff close to beach and medina,"Located at the beach and a few steps to the mwdina. A geat hotel with a large pool and a really friendly staff and waiters with fine voices. Thanks to Moulay, Azit, Hicham, Khaiid, Fatima-Zahra and Abdellah. We spend a lovely birthday at your house."
 July 2019,4,Sheltered beach front hotel,"My friend and I stayed on a room only basis. The hotel is well situated on the beach front (just across the road to the beach) and a 5 minute walk into the medina. The pool area was lovely, well kept, the best sun loungers I have ever experienced (almost a double for one person) and there was never a problem with the area being over crowded. The pool is cold, but much needed to cool off, and the pool men work hard to keep everyone happy. The twin room overlooking the pool on the 2nd floor was spacious and had everything we needed. Complimentary tea bags, coffee sachets (no milk) were provided along with snacks of dates and nuts. The only issue we had was fixed quickly, small ants in a non-working mini- fridge, there had been an issue with the power supply to the fridge. Although…"
 July 2019,4,Relaxing beachside wheelchair accessible stay,"We spent 2 nights here in a wheelchair accessible room. The location of the hotel was fantastic, being directly across the road from the beach. It was very easy to cross the road (using the wheelchair accessible crossing) to visit the beach, MBeach restaurant, and the hotel's private beach area. The location is a very safe area and only a five-minute walk to the Medina, Port, and kasbah. The hotel facilities were very good, with a beautiful pool area to relax. The reception was nicely decorated with modern art works and boutiques. The restaurant and bar served great food, with excellent service. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet (especially the made to order omelettes and crêpes) where we were able to sit by the pool in the sun for the morning. The wheelchair…"
 July 2019,4,"nice, with some reservations...","The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast, the pool area, the private beach and all the people who work there! We were promised Sea view rooms, but we got side view of a building. The shower sprayed all over and flooded the floor of the bathroom. The toilet was sluggish, and the sink was even more sluggish...went to bed one night with a full sink, and it was still like that in the morning! I must say they addressed the issues immediately! The chamber maids were never seen, but always there...as they cleaned up the room at least twice daily and folded our pjs to look like butterflies!! The breakfast was plentiful and fresh, with omelette station, crepe station and squeezed juice station. The staff anticipated your needs and by the end they knew our preferences!"
 June 2019,4,Great holiday just a few things took the shine off,"We booked this hotel in advance and when booking was informed we would pay at the property, this did not happen and was overcharged by approx £60- this was not an issue until we found out we didn't have breakfast included in our booking another extra charge. The hotel itself is lovely, the pool area is stunning with the most comfortable sun loungers and enough space for everyone to enjoy. Maids come in quite early in the morning and again in the afternoon so if you want to lay in and not be disturbed I would def put the ""do not disturb"" sign on your door! Location is perfect for exploring the city and beach in Essaouira, 5 days is more than enough time to enjoy everything there."
 June 2019,1,HORRIBLE! AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE,"We were visiting Essaouira for a wedding and before we checked into the wedding hotel we thought we'd try a beach front property. We regret it now because it is anything but a beach front property. You have to cross a road and it is generally not well set up. Upon check out of our brief stay, a friend from the wedding party was helping us with our bags and the male receptionist made a very rude and accusatory remark about how our reservation was for 2 people but 3 had stayed. I explained that he was a friend was just helping with our bags. The male receptionist smirked and took a very unpleasant approach. He needs retraining (he was wearing glasses). My wife misplaced some expensive oil in the room and it was supposedly thrown up by the cleaning staff, it was no where to be…"
 June 2019,5,Loved it,"This Hotel is literally one of my faves, everything is perfect ( costumer service...) , and A special thanks to Miss Loubna for her kindness and professionalism and her team that was always around if we needed anything"
 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time. The fantastic breakfast buffet that you could have either inside the restaurant or sitting by the pool, with a variety of options from local and international cuisine, we love it!! We had a lovely room with ocean view, spotless! (well-done cleaning team) We will definitely come back."
 May 2019,3,Charmless and impersonal,"Sorry to say that this hotel did not live up to our expectations. It may have been the time of year that made it difficult for staff, but we found a lot that disappointed us. The rather cold reception we received on our arrival set the tone and throughout our six night stay we found the Reception, although perfectly polite, unfriendly and not particularly willing to help with anything. The room, overlooking the beach, was adequate but in need of updating, especially the plumbing. The washbasin vacillated between not retaining the water and not draining it away. Occasionally there was a rather bad smell from the WC. The standard of cleanliness though was excellent and the housekeeping staff were cheerful and friendly. The concierge (several) on the front entrance were…"
 May 2019,5,"Fabulous - superb customer service, ocean view room, al fresco breakfast, pool & solarium","Brilliantly located hotel with private beach & large refreshing pool with plenty of loungers at both. A fabulous breakfast. Super comfortable bed & all facilities that you required of a hotel room, including ocean facing balcony. Our room was immaculately looked after by Messouda who was delightful"
 April 2019,4,Relax in a boutique style hotel,Our 5th stay at this hotel. Lovely warm welcome from reception. Noted the new carpets in corridors to bedrooms and new curtains in the bedroom. Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home. Our room was old but was still comfy and the balcony over looking the pool was nice to sit out in the morning and evening. Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"
 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package. This is a modern, comfortable hotel that is located directly across the street from the fantastic beach at Essaouira. There is a wonderful beach walk that runs along the beach area from the hotel all the way to old town Essaouira area which is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room had a nice view of the outdoor pool/garden area from the balcony - very nice. The bathroom was clean and relatively spacious, and has good quality toilletries. The included breakfast was good with a nice selection of different items - breads, meats, fruits, etc. This is a very nice hotel in a good location with access to both the beach (across the street) and…"
 June 2019,5,Loved it,"This Hotel is literally one of my faves, everything is perfect ( costumer service...) , and A special thanks to Miss Loubna for her kindness and professionalism and her team that was always around if we needed anything"
 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time. The fantastic breakfast buffet that you could have either inside the restaurant or sitting by the pool, with a variety of options from local and international cuisine, we love it!! We had a lovely room with ocean view, spotless! (well-done cleaning team) We will definitely come back."
 May 2019,3,Charmless and impersonal,"Sorry to say that this hotel did not live up to our expectations. It may have been the time of year that made it difficult for staff, but we found a lot that disappointed us. The rather cold reception we received on our arrival set the tone and throughout our six night stay we found the Reception, although perfectly polite, unfriendly and not particularly willing to help with anything. The room, overlooking the beach, was adequate but in need of updating, especially the plumbing. The washbasin vacillated between not retaining the water and not draining it away. Occasionally there was a rather bad smell from the WC. The standard of cleanliness though was excellent and the housekeeping staff were cheerful and friendly. The concierge (several) on the front entrance were…"
 May 2019,5,"Fabulous - superb customer service, ocean view room, al fresco breakfast, pool & solarium","Brilliantly located hotel with private beach & large refreshing pool with plenty of loungers at both. A fabulous breakfast. Super comfortable bed & all facilities that you required of a hotel room, including ocean facing balcony. Our room was immaculately looked after by Messouda who was delightful"
 April 2019,4,Relax in a boutique style hotel,Our 5th stay at this hotel. Lovely warm welcome from reception. Noted the new carpets in corridors to bedrooms and new curtains in the bedroom. Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home. Our room was old but was still comfy and the balcony over looking the pool was nice to sit out in the morning and evening. Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"

 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"
 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package. This is a modern, comfortable hotel that is located directly across the street from the fantastic beach at Essaouira. There is a wonderful beach walk that runs along the beach area from the hotel all the way to old town Essaouira area which is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room had a nice view of the outdoor pool/garden area from the balcony - very nice. The bathroom was clean and relatively spacious, and has good quality toilletries. The included breakfast was good with a nice selection of different items - breads, meats, fruits, etc. This is a very nice hotel in a good location with access to both the beach (across the street) and…"
 June 2019,5,Loved it,"This Hotel is literally one of my faves, everything is perfect ( costumer service...) , and A special thanks to Miss Loubna for her kindness and professionalism and her team that was always around if we needed anything"
 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time. The fantastic breakfast buffet that you could have either inside the restaurant or sitting by the pool, with a variety of options from local and international cuisine, we love it!! We had a lovely room with ocean view, spotless! (well-done cleaning team) We will definitely come back."
 May 2019,3,Charmless and impersonal,"Sorry to say that this hotel did not live up to our expectations. It may have been the time of year that made it difficult for staff, but we found a lot that disappointed us. The rather cold reception we received on our arrival set the tone and throughout our six night stay we found the Reception, although perfectly polite, unfriendly and not particularly willing to help with anything. The room, overlooking the beach, was adequate but in need of updating, especially the plumbing. The washbasin vacillated between not retaining the water and not draining it away.

 April 2019,4,Relax in a boutique style hotel,Our 5th stay at this hotel. Lovely warm welcome from reception. Noted the new carpets in corridors to bedrooms and new curtains in the bedroom. Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home.

It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home. Our room was old but was still comfy and the balcony over looking the pool was nice to sit out in the morning and evening. Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"
 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package. This is a modern, comfortable hotel that is located directly across the street from the fantastic beach at Essaouira. There is a wonderful beach walk that runs along the beach area from the hotel all the way to old town Essaouira area which is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room had a nice view of the outdoor pool/garden area from the balcony - very nice. The bathroom was clean and relatively spacious, and has good quality toilletries.

 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time.

 April 2019,4,Relax in a boutique style hotel,Our 5th stay at this hotel. Lovely warm welcome from reception. Noted the new carpets in corridors to bedrooms and new curtains in the bedroom. Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home. Our room was old but was still comfy and the balcony over looking the pool was nice to sit out in the morning and evening. Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"
 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package. This is a modern, comfortable hotel that is located directly across the street from the fantastic beach at Essaouira. There is a wonderful beach walk that runs along the beach area from the hotel all the way to old town Essaouira area which is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room had a nice view of the outdoor pool/garden area from the balcony - very nice.

 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time.

The fantastic breakfast buffet that you could have either inside the restaurant or sitting by the pool, with a variety of options from local and international cuisine, we love it!! We had a lovely room with ocean view, spotless! (well-done cleaning team) We will definitely come back."
 May 2019,3,Charmless and impersonal,"Sorry to say that this hotel did not live up to our expectations. It may have been the time of year that made it difficult for staff, but we found a lot that disappointed us. The rather cold reception we received on our arrival set the tone and throughout our six night stay we found the Reception, although perfectly polite, unfriendly and not particularly willing to help with anything. The room, overlooking the beach, was adequate but in need of updating, especially the plumbing. The washbasin vacillated between not retaining the water and not draining it away. Occasionally there was a rather bad smell from the WC. The standard of cleanliness though was excellent and the housekeeping staff were cheerful and friendly.

 May 2019,5,"Fabulous - superb customer service, ocean view room, al fresco breakfast, pool & solarium","Brilliantly located hotel with private beach & large refreshing pool with plenty of loungers at both. A fabulous breakfast. Super comfortable bed & all facilities that you required of a hotel room, including ocean facing balcony. Our room was immaculately looked after by Messouda who was delightful"
 April 2019,4,Relax in a boutique style hotel,Our 5th stay at this hotel. Lovely warm welcome from reception. Noted the new carpets in corridors to bedrooms and new curtains in the bedroom. Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home. Our room was old but was still comfy and the balcony over looking the pool was nice to sit out in the morning and evening. Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"
 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package. This is a modern, comfortable hotel that is located directly across the street from the fantastic beach at Essaouira. There is a wonderful beach walk that runs along the beach area from the hotel all the way to old town Essaouira area which is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room had a nice view of the outdoor pool/garden area from the balcony - very nice.

 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special.

 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time. The fantastic breakfast buffet that you could have either inside the restaurant or sitting by the pool, with a variety of options from local and international cuisine, we love it!! We had a lovely room with ocean view, spotless! (well-done cleaning team) We will definitely come back."
 May 2019,3,Charmless and impersonal,"Sorry to say that this hotel did not live up to our expectations. It may have been the time of year that made it difficult for staff, but we found a lot that disappointed us. The rather cold reception we received on our arrival set the tone and throughout our six night stay we found the Reception, although perfectly polite, unfriendly and not particularly willing to help with anything. The room, overlooking the beach, was adequate but in need of updating, especially the plumbing. The washbasin vacillated between not retaining the water and not draining it away.

 April 2019,4,Relax in a boutique style hotel,Our 5th stay at this hotel. Lovely warm welcome from reception. Noted the new carpets in corridors to bedrooms and new curtains in the bedroom. Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home. Our room was old but was still comfy and the balcony over looking the pool was nice to sit out in the morning and evening. Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"
 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package.

 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package. This is a modern, comfortable hotel that is located directly across the street from the fantastic beach at Essaouira. There is a wonderful beach walk that runs along the beach area from the hotel all the way to old town Essaouira area which is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room had a nice view of the outdoor pool/garden area from the balcony - very nice. The bathroom was clean and relatively spacious, and has good quality toilletries. The included breakfast was good with a nice selection of different items - breads, meats, fruits, etc. This is a very nice hotel in a good location with access to both the beach (across the street) and…"
 June 2019,5,Loved it,"This Hotel is literally one of my faves, everything is perfect ( costumer service...) , and A special thanks to Miss Loubna for her kindness and professionalism and her team that was always around if we needed anything"
 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time. The fantastic breakfast buffet that you could have either inside the restaurant or sitting by the pool, with a variety of options from local and international cuisine, we love it!! We had a lovely room with ocean view, spotless! (well-done cleaning team) We will definitely come back."
 May 2019,3,Charmless and impersonal,"Sorry to say that this hotel did not live up to our expectations. It may have been the time of year that made it difficult for staff, but we found a lot that disappointed us. The rather cold reception we received on our arrival set the tone and throughout our six night stay we found the Reception, although perfectly polite, unfriendly and not particularly willing to help with anything. The room, overlooking the beach, was adequate but in need of updating, especially the plumbing. The washbasin vacillated between not retaining the water and not draining it away.

 April 2019,4,Relax in a boutique style hotel,Our 5th stay at this hotel. Lovely warm welcome from reception. Noted the new carpets in corridors to bedrooms and new curtains in the bedroom. Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home. Our room was old but was still comfy and the balcony over looking the pool was nice to sit out in the morning and evening. Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk.

Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"
 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package. This is a modern, comfortable hotel that is located directly across the street from the fantastic beach at Essaouira. There is a wonderful beach walk that runs along the beach area from the hotel all the way to old town Essaouira area which is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room had a nice view of the outdoor pool/garden area from the balcony - very nice. The bathroom was clean and relatively spacious, and has good quality toilletries. The included breakfast was good with a nice selection of different items - breads, meats, fruits, etc. This is a very nice hotel in a good location with access to both the beach (across the street) and…"
 June 2019,5,Loved it,"This Hotel is literally one of my faves, everything is perfect ( costumer service...) , and A special thanks to Miss Loubna for her kindness and professionalism and her team that was always around if we needed anything"
 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time. The fantastic breakfast buffet that you could have either inside the restaurant or sitting by the pool, with a variety of options from local and international cuisine, we love it!! We had a lovely room with ocean view, spotless! (well-done cleaning team) We will definitely come back."
 May 2019,3,Charmless and impersonal,"Sorry to say that this hotel did not live up to our expectations. It may have been the time of year that made it difficult for staff, but we found a lot that disappointed us. The rather cold reception we received on our arrival set the tone and throughout our six night stay we found the Reception, although perfectly polite, unfriendly and not particularly willing to help with anything. The room, overlooking the beach, was adequate but in need of updating, especially the plumbing. The washbasin vacillated between not retaining the water and not draining it away.

 April 2019,4,Relax in a boutique style hotel,Our 5th stay at this hotel. Lovely warm welcome from reception. Noted the new carpets in corridors to bedrooms and new curtains in the bedroom. Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers.

Pleased to see the hotel is reinvesting. We had a room at the front of hotel overlooking the beach as requested. Very comfortable. Breakfast is fine. Pleased to note there were more staff on duty to bring tea/coffee etc. Only fault at breakfast is that they have done away with the omelette station outside. It has moved back indoors and unfortunately when there is a queue you can't get near to the other hot dishes. Easy to fix. Bar prices were the same as last year but still on the expensive side meaning the bar is very quite. As I have suggested before more reasonable prices will result in more customers. We had a nice lunch at the pool…
 May 2019,4,Nice,We stayed for two nights as part of a tour group. I LOVED having tea and coffee making facilities in the room as it makes it feel like home. Our room was old but was still comfy and the balcony over looking the pool was nice to sit out in the morning and evening. Was a great location to walk into the village for dinner and shopping and was right across from the beach. The service and staff was friendly and very accommodating and assisted when needed. The breakfast was yum and was nice sitting alongside the pool to enjoy it. Would recommended the hotel!
 April 2019,5,Modern and close to everything,"We stayed here with our group of 25 after spending four nights at a Riad in Marrakech. While we enjoyed the Riad we loved spending time in a larger hotel. Breakfast is served around the pool, there are two bars inside and a restaurant. I didn't use the spa. Our room on the second floor had a balcony overlooking the street which was fine with us. The huge tub was perfect for soaking after ATV rides. Other restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. The medina, for shopping was also close. We didn't go to the beach, as it was unusually windy when we visited. We hope to go back next year and take friends. The bed was very, very comfortable. Great and helpful staff!"
 October 2018,5,"Comfortable, Modern Hotel in a Great Location","We stayed at this hotel for two (2) nights as part of a tour package. This is a modern, comfortable hotel that is located directly across the street from the fantastic beach at Essaouira. There is a wonderful beach walk that runs along the beach area from the hotel all the way to old town Essaouira area which is only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room had a nice view of the outdoor pool/garden area from the balcony - very nice. The bathroom was clean and relatively spacious, and has good quality toilletries. The included breakfast was good with a nice selection of different items - breads, meats, fruits, etc. This is a very nice hotel in a good location with access to both the beach (across the street) and…"
 June 2019,5,Loved it,"This Hotel is literally one of my faves, everything is perfect ( costumer service...) , and A special thanks to Miss Loubna for her kindness and professionalism and her team that was always around if we needed anything"
 June 2019,5,Perfect stay again :),"We came here on our honeymoon last year and returned again ..... the hotel is great and perfect location but it is the team that work there who make it special. Everyone is so friendly. A special shout out to the doormen who are so cheerful and welcoming every day , housekeeping for all the nice touches in our room , the kitchen / chef who made a surprise anniversary cake for us , reception who organised it and the lovely guys who work by the pool who work so hard and keep smiling . Very impressed also by the excellent English as it’s the 3rd language for most . Lovely hotel and super team ...... big thank you 🙏"
 June 2019,5,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the hotel , it was a first trip to essaouira and I fell in love with it , the hotel is litterally in the middle of the city so everything is near ( no need to book a car ) , the food is amazing if you want to have lunch in the hotel , I’ll definitely comeback"
 May 2019,5,Superb place to stay in this amazing city,"Great Staff (Latifa and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant, reception, doormen and cleaning people) always greeting you with a smile and making sure that you are having a wonderful time. The fantastic breakfast buffet that you could have either inside the restaurant or sitting by the pool, with a variety of options from local and international cuisine, we love it!! We had a lovely room with ocean view, spotless! (well-done cleaning team) We will definitely come back."
 May 2019,3,Charmless and impersonal,"Sorry to say that this hotel did not live up to our expectations. It may have been the time of year that made it difficult for staff, but we found a lot that disappointed us. The rather cold reception we received on our arrival set the tone and throughout our six night stay we found the Reception, although perfectly polite, unfriendly and not particularly willing to help with anything. The room, overlooking the beach, was adequate but in need of updating, especially the plumbing. The washbasin vacillated between not retaining the water and not draining it away. Occasionally there was a rather bad smell from the WC. The standard of cleanliness though was excellent and the housekeeping staff were cheerful and friendly. The concierge (several) on the front entrance were…"

 April 2014,3,"Good location, need service improvement","We stayed 4 nights in a room looking at the ocean. Location is indeed great, in front of the sea and 5 minutes walking distance to the Medina. We experienced inconsistent service : good service with 1 person in front desk at the beginning of our stay, making our restaurant reservation, organising us a camel tour. The medina tour organised by the hotel with a local guide was the main activity the hotel proposed. We tried the bar in the evening, but was totally dead with no real atmosphere. We also experienced average service at the spa, with Thalassa staff giving the impression to be in a hurry to get over with you. Pool is not heated so quite cold at this time of the year. Towels and available seats were often missing in the afternoon around the pool. We found the room is…"
 April 2014,3,"Nice Rooms, not great service, no real atmosphere","The hotel is in a very good spot, directly over from the beach while still being only a 2-3 minute walk from the medina. The rooms were really very nice, what lets this hotel down is slow and often elusive service, poor quality overpriced food and bar, and a genuine lack of atmosphere for a resort hotel and it's got a bit of a stuffy air to it. The only physical downside was that the walls and floors seem quite thin and noise seems to bound about quite a lot inside. 4 cheese panini's and drinks takes about 45 minutes to come and in less time you could walk to the city and back and arrive with something better for approx 25% of the price. There are only about 30 or 40 loungers for (100 rooms by the pool, which are predominanly held by absent people). There are a lot of staff…"
 March 2014,5,Worth the money,"Nice rooms, wonderful bed and very good breakfast. Close to the Medina at the beach. Only negative remark on pool not heated and water too high concentration of chlorine. Nice indoor salt water pool after 7pm though."
 March 2014,4,"Great location, on sea front and 5 minutes from harbour and Medina",After 4 nights in a riad in Marrakech this was a really good contrast. Our room was overlooking the pool with the best and most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We had excellent breakfasts by the pool every day. In the main hotel restaurant the menu was too restricted and chilly from the aircon. It would have helped to have more printed information in English as most of the staff didnt speak it. This caused a bit of confusion in the spa for costing treatments and was more expensive than we were lead to be believe. Room service food wasnt up the same standard as the rest of hotel services. Overall a really good visit.
 March 2014,1,Disappointed with outcome.,"Having recently done a two stay holiday in Marrakech and Essaouira with the second leg at Le Medina we were devastated after discovering we had left our camera by the pool and that it was not there nor had it been handed in after realising it was missing. It never occurred to us that this would be the case. This is a five star hotel, you would expect your belongs to be safe, of course we appreciate that leaving your valuables accidentally unattended there is a risk but with hotel security ever present we can not understand how a camera can disappear and the Management are not able to locate it. We even offered a reward but to no avail. Sadden by our loss as the camera held many special memories, not just from this trip but others that as yet we hadn't managed to download, we…"
 February 2014,5,How is this not number 1...??,"We decided to move across from (the not so nice) Marrakesh to the subtle, serene splendor of Essaouirra and stayed at the majestic Le Medina. The staff were overly diligent and the location was also very impressive, overlooking the sea. We did not eat here as we would rather try the local cuisine but one could certainly feel the overwhelming sense of fantastic service (all enquiries were met with an infectious enthusiasm). Will I return? Yes. Will I use the Medina? Absolutely. From the hotels we saw, they didn't seem to have the same grandeur or location. Perfectly located, easy to find, superb staff and the rooms were beautifully decorated and luxurious."
 February 2014,4,Good,"Very well located right in front of Essaouira bay and just a step away of the medina walls, this hotel still offers very good confort though it's growing age. We were really surprised how well the wifi worked at the balcony of our room or at the big lounge room. Very welcoming staff, surveilled parking car just in front."
 February 2014,5,"a perfect location - facing the beach, walking distance into the old town","the sea facing room with a balcony was great - sizeable, well appointed - although we would have loved a coffee making machine - excellent views etc. The staff were helpful and efficient. The breakfast was good - the coffee indifferent and inconsistent. The other guests were mainly French. There was an excellent selection at breakfast - and when staying a few days it was obvious that the menu varied."
 January 2014,4,High end hotel... beach front... a good deal,"Le Medina is a high-end hotel. Forget about stars, as they are mostly an exercise in fiction and vanity. Very few places (France, Spain) have rigid standards for stars. As fair as I can tell, TA accepts the self-rating of hotels, so everything turns into a 5 star hotel. So, let's stick to ""high-end"". The room is well finished, the bathroom amenities are more spa-like (although they could still be better). I stayed two nights there, in January (not the best time to visit Essaouira). So low season that I got an upgrade to a pool view room. Not sure what I had before, as all the rooms look the same. Room is comfortable, large, overlooking the pool. No kettle (fewer hotels have them nowadays), free wifi (despite booking.com claiming that it is 10 euros per night), and free safe…"
 January 2014,5,Booked two nights-stayed four,"What better way to start the day than breakfast sitting under the palms by the swimming pool, away from the dust and bustle and traffic noise? It's a decent breakfast too, with lots of fresh fruit, pastries, pancakes and hot food if required. The rooms are large and functional, the bed wide and comfortable, the shower hot and strong. The staff are charming (apart from one or two on reception, though there was one consistently smiling and profesional lady at reception too) and you can even leave your car securely for free. We occasionally ate in the beachside restaurant who do very good salads. The hotel is well situated a short walk from the Medina and just opposite the beach. For the off season rate that we paid, I felt that this hotel was a bargain."
 December 2013,4,"Good place, worth the money","Just staying one night, not enough time to see all facilities. The hotel was on good location, good ocean view and short walking distance to medina. Reception staffs were very friendly and well trained. Room was standard for a good 4-5 stars hotel. Breakfast was buffet with variety of choices. Dinner was excellent although it took so long to serve. From our experience with hotels in many cities in Morocco, this hotel was among the best."
 January 2014,5,Amine and Nela,"We stayed at the Medina hotel from 11 to 14 January , Very friendly staff and Beauty throughout all parts of the hotel , We have estimated the beautiful words and the net smiles from everyone who work there , we have also estimated to welcome us with fresh towels ( water orange flowers ) with cakes and tea ,It's nice to find the two pieces of chocolate every evening when we comback to room...simply it's the hotel that we was looking for and we will comback as soon is possible ."
 December 2013,3,Disappointing,The hotel and rooms were Ok but because we didn't spend any extra they felt the need to add 'room service' and 'Mogador CLUB soir' to our bill as we were in a rush to get away to the airport and told us it was for 'taxes de sejour'. On examination when we returned we discovered they had added to the bill. Disappointing in light of the cost of a 5* hotel! Also some of the rooms were incredibly noisy with drunken guests in the swimming pool at night and what sounded like staff moving furniture around in rooms nearby!
 January 2014,4,Good choice in Mogador,"Very good hotel, nicely located just facing the ocean. the staff is very polite, kind and helpful. Rooms are spacious, clean and eqipped with everything necessary to spend good time in Essaouira. Very good pool protected from the wind (the city is a surfers paradise so very windy). Definetely a good choice!"
 December 2013,2,5 Star? Where?,This facility is by far not a 5 Star Hotel and you can get much better service for less in Essouira - my room wanst ready when I arrived so I had to wait one hour (4 pm) - no information about hotel facilities and every time one tries to talk to the recptionist for some infomation they give you the feeling you are annoying them - booked a superior double and got a twin bed (justification: we dont have double rooms anymore. no excuse or appologies: nothing) - food is very expensive (compared to local prices) maximum mid-range (nothing special at all with a tendency to poor) - waited for over one hour for a salad at the pool (after I asked for it and said I was waiting for one hour: no excuse or appologies) - the lady in the spa ist disgracefull. There is no sauna here and u…
 December 2013,2,A place to be ?,"We (two coupes) did travel to Essaouira for spending our New Year night in Morocco and did book a three night stay in the Le Medina Essaouira Hotel Thalassa sea & spa - MGallery Collection. Once we arrived at the hotel, all four of us did receive a refreshing tissue and we were asked to wait, because the rooms have not yet been ready. Some minutes later, my girlfriend and I did get served a tea and some tasty cakes….great service…however, our friends did not receive the tea…mistakes happen. Later on, the room was ready for us, the luggage was transported in our rooms, and actually those rooms are very nice, great big television, separate bath room and toilette, nice balcony, big and comfortable bed. Next morning we went for breakfast, which is ok considering Le Medina Essaouira…"
 December 2013,2,Very modest,"Very modest expedience. I Stayed 3 nights on new years eve. I am a club GOLD. No particular Welcome. Upgrade impossible They SAid hotel full but appeared empty. Noisy rooms, slow and bed service. But very clean. Needs to improve to be a real m gallery. On new years eve, entrance of hotel Was closed as there Was a party in the lobby. Guests obliged to pass through rear door!!!"
 January 2014,2,Very poor and disappointing.,"6 happy travellers arrive for New Year celebrations. New Year party was excellent. Great atmosphere and entertainment albeit that some of the dishes served were strange to say the least. What followed however did not in any way keep up the standards that are obviously within the capabilities of the staff. Breakfast was a very poor event with totally disorganised arrangements. Tables with dirty ashtrays, unclean tables, lack of plates, cutlery cups and very inept service. Lots of pleasant young staff wondering around in a daze. No attention to detail and as for hot drinks - forget it. After 4 days we eventually managed to get some water which was almost hot enough to make tea. A serious lack of sun beds in the pool area meant that only the lucky few were able to…"
 November 2013,5,Five star service,"The best in this hotel is the service. It is really personal, very kind and makes you feel that you are staying in the five star hotel. The rooms are big enough and well equipped with balconies. The beach is just in the front of the hotel and the old town is only a half kilometer away. The parking is also free. A nice pool is available in the hotel as well. The breakfast offers a wide selection of food, but it is a little bit pricy if it is not included in the room price."
 December 2013,5,"Excellent service, great location","I wouldn't say that this hotel qualifies to be a 5 star hotel, but it's wonderful location just a couple of blocks away from the medina in Essaouira and the great service worth of it. Rooms are very comfortable and quite, breakfast is good if not perfect. As a whole this hotel applies for a great relief in the frentic Moroccan style."
 December 2013,2,In dire need of refurbishment,"If there is a price for the worst interior design, this hotel will definitively qualify. This old Sofitel looks like a worn out abandoned hotel and as they could not sell it to a new owner, decided to keep it in the Accor group. As far as I am concerned, a wrong decision. I am sure some 10-15 years ago this probably was the best what Essaouira had to offer. However, the hotel is in dire need of refurbishing. Apart from the appalling interior taste (never seen such a random collection of furniture, colors, randomly placed in the reception area, a front desk absent of any attractive design, simply an affront to the senses. The first room we were shown as appalling, many details simply wrong. Hopelessly outdated furniture, a balcony where the plants were absent or dying to lack of…"
 November 2013,1,Nasty,"There are so many reasons not to like this hotel; the greatest of which is the horrible service. When we arrived, they asked us to sit and wait even though we had a reservation. They insisted on 3000 deposit; more than 3 times the rooms rate. Because their connection for the credit card didn't work, they made us sit and wait until for 45 minutes before they allowed us to go to the room! Then they put us in a room where the halls had just been varnished and the smell was horrible, ****Note - the hotel was basically empty. We saw only a few people the entire stay. There were so many rooms they could have put us in - but they chose the worst available. We asked to move - more waiting. That room was filthy. There was blood in the tub! I ended up cleaning it just so we…"
 November 2013,4,Great location with potential to be five stars,"The location of this hotel is perfect, opposite a private beach and 5 minutes walk to the walls of the old town of Essaouira you couldn't ask for a better location. It used to be the Sofitel but since Sofitel has opened a brand new resort in Essouira it has been ""downgraded"" to a McGallery Collection and whilst there was nothing particularly wrong with it I can see how it is starting to fray around the edges both in decor and service levels and it just needs a little bit of a push to get it up to a higher standard again. Upon arrival we waited for 5 minutes until anyone helped us with our luggage up the steps, check in was complicated and slow and there was some confusion with my booking. Once all that was sorted we went to the rooms - if there is one thing that this hotel needs…"
 October 2013,5,Excellent hotel in a great location,"We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed our stay. The room and the bathroom were both very nice and clean, and the beds were very comfortable. The private balcony was also very nice for relaxing. We found the service to be professional and efficient. We ordered room service on the second day when we wanted to leave early. The food arrived at the time requested. The buffet breakfast was decent and had a variety of items. The location is great. We had a rental car, and there was free parking across the street. It is about a five minute walk to the medina along the beachfront. Overall we found it good value and definitely recommend."
 October 2013,4,Great value,"We stayed for 3 nights and had a great time. The hotel is well placed just outside the Medina and opposite the beach. They have generally good facilities, but the side of the pool which gets the sun is a little small and they did run out of towels! The Hammam is very nice - very dark and cave like! Apparent from the fact our room wasn't ready when we checked in we would have little to complain about - all of the people were very nice and the hotel-organised tour of the Medina was very informative. Not a 5 star hotel by European standards (it needs some refurb work) but altogether very good value for money."
 October 2013,5,Super Hotel,"Had a great stay at this hotel, our second visit, if anything the staff were better, more friendly and efficient than our previous stay - the reception staff were particularly good - the rooms were excellent and the bathroom superberb with a lovely range of Toiletries - Food was very good an excellent range of breakfast foods and their Beach side restaurant excellent."
 October 2013,2,Disappointed,"The hotel seems very impressive at first, but then the faults start to show. The positives: great location, nice outdoor pool, friendly waiting staff at poolside, clean bedroom and bathroom. The negatives: The service is shockingly slow. It's best to order a drink or food well in advance of actually wanting them, due to the time it takes to be served. The hallway carpet is filthy. There is no soundproofing whatsoever - resulting in a lack of sleep. Even with earplugs, the banging of furniture and doors kept me awake at night. I cannot recommend this hotel, as I would not choose to stay here again. Also, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, as a guest at the hotel, the spa pool is ONLY available from 7pm, which isn't great. And the 'gym' is terrible - the equipment…"
 October 2013,3,Nice but...,"This is advertised as a five star hotel and, by Moroccan standards, it probably is. However, if you're expecting a European 5 star experience, you will be disappointed. The good news is that the hotel is clean, the rooms are of a good size and the location is fantastic. The staff are very pleasant as well but the service is unbelievably slow. Expect to wait at least ten minutes for a drink at the bar - even if you are the only customer. Room service takes all day. You might have your room cleaned by mid afternoon. I tried the gym. The treadmill, stepper and exercise bike had all seen better days and need replacing. If exercise is important to you, it may be worth looking elsewhere. The worst part of the stay was the soundproofing. There isn't any. We literally could…"
 October 2013,3,A great break ruined by poor service,"We booked in for one night and I can't fault the actual hotel for anything. The reception staff and hotel staff were brilliant. The problem lies with the Cote de Plage beach restaurant. As the hotel restaurant was closed we ate at the beach restaurant. Good spot, nice food. The problem is with the service. Menus eventually came and were in French which was no issue at all, although when we asked to see what desserts they had the same menu come back in English which may have made picking starters and mains easier. So onto the drinks. We ordered and waited 20 minutes for drinks. Then had to ask 3 times for the water we had ordered. As for the food, 40 minutes after we ordered my wifes soup arrived. As soon as she finished that with the bowl still on the table and her barely…"
 September 2013,3,A little disappointed,"Arrived here after 3 nights in the Sofitel Marrakesh. On arrival the reception area is lovely, fresh flowers and traditional tea maker. Downhill from there on :( hotel room smelled awful, pool so cloudy nobody would go in. Very short staffed and only one waitress serving tables at night. Staff work very hard but they are just to few to provide even a 4 star experience. Food very expensive but a set menu is available every night in the main restaurant which was good value for money. We tried room service a few times but food arrived cold (also had to phone from bathroom as room phones not working). This hotel is marketed as a la carte but is not. Would not return."
 September 2013,4,Luxury and comfort but 'French style' service,"Located a short walk from the old walled town or medina, this modern hotel in Essaouira provides luxury and comfort in its bedrooms which either overlook the sheltered oval-shaped pool or the long, sandy beach. There is an impressive atrium and large breakfast area but the Moroccan restaurant with traditional fare, open in the evening, did not appeal. Cote Plage, the hotel's beachside restaurant serves an international menu and light meals could be had at lunchtime beside the pool. Service poolside was exasperatingly slow and, not surprisingly for a luxury hotel, prices were high compared to what could be found in some excellent restaurants in the medina. The standard of housekeeping was very high. Bedrooms and bathrooms were spotlessly clean and the maids friendly and smiling.…"
 September 2013,5,Lovely great hotel!!,"We stayed here four days at the end of our Holiday. After traveling by car quite some days seeing a lot of Morocco, this was the best place to relax. The Hotel is located across from the boulevard and beach, great. The Hotel is beautiful and super comfortable, making sure you feel you're on Holiday and get all care needed. The rooms are great (we had a standard room), clean, lovely, spacious bathroom and closets. Also a flatscreen tv with movie channels, very relaxing!!!! The pool is lovely, big, enough space. And the restaurants and bar are excellent. Definitely recommend this Hotel in lovely Essouira!!"
 September 2013,3,"Well intentioned, well located...","Enjoyed a few days in this hotel by the sea. +'s: - location: easy walk into town, well lit and safe trot in to have a wander and Essaoira is perfect for casual exploring - free parking across road from hotel with security - big room (no need to book suite in my opinion) with balcony and a choice of view - pool or sea - big comfy bed with great pillows - sunbeds/towels on beach - outside restaurant by pool has some buzz at breakfast time -'s: - food, not great quality and rather spendy, I would recommend eating out - plenty of options on the doorstep - lovely bar, but no-one in it so zero athmos- shame as they could do more to promote this and encourage people in; the hotel is rather dead generally of an evening - breakfast buffet - reasonable selection of breaded goods,…"
 July 2013,4,"Very nice, large rooms and mostly good service","This was our first stop on our honeymoon. Overall we were really pleased with it all and would recommend although only through 'offer' prices as our value for money included visiting with a Groupon. The pool, breakfast, room, room service, cocktails and general service were all great. Not being particularly bilingual was not an issue here as most spoke English sufficiently if not very well. The room did end up with ants roaming around but we had a small amount of snacks around and part of the scenery was large plants reaching up the side of the building. Although annoying it couldn't be helped much. The wifi was very temperamental which led to quite a bit of frustration. When offered it should be consistent either way so that customers know what to expect. The bed was the…"
 September 2013,4,good hotel excellent location,stayed 7 nights staff very helpful we found service to be very good in need of refurbishment but rooms very clean as was all of the hotel pool area nice place to chill out drinks average price for hotels we had lunch round the pool and food very good we had a great time in essaouira and would like to thank all the hotel staff for playing there part in making our holiday memorable stayed september 2013 travelled as a couple
 September 2013,4,Great location,"Booked on hotels.com based upon location and good star rating and T/A reviews. Very much as billed - nice rooms, good amenities, lovely pool, great for the beach and town. Could do with a bit of a refurb/tidy up but not a major problem."
 September 2013,4,Better than I expected,"Stayed here for 4 nights. Overall I was very impressed. At check in my friend waved his Accor platinum card about and we were given an immediate upgrade to a junior suite which was really big and had an enormous balcony. As others have noted here the hotel does indeed need a thorough renovation especially the hallways (the carpets are truly revolting - more a case of wipe your feet on the way out rather than on the way in) and the room itself is very dated although still very clean and comfortable. The pool area is very nice and we didn't have any problems getting sunloungers. We found all staff to be friendly and helpful especially the staff on duty at breakfast - breakfast was very nice, at tables around the pool, with a big selection. Only criticism was that neither the…"
 September 2013,4,Tries hard but could improve! Very Good stay though.,If you read through the last dozen reviews you get the same feel as we do. It's trying hard to be something they are falling short of. This is a great shame. Some staff are excellent and attentive and some are going through the motions. The pool and decking need a serious refurbishment. We witnessed 2 people having incidents where the poolside / decking gave way underfoot. Unacceptable. We agree with all past comments. Ideally located for beach and medinas. I would recommend the 'BAR' just 5 minutes away towards the port. Cheap local beer - ice cold and great views of the coast or local football games. Goals and fighting! Just like Ice Hockey!! Otherwise all the usual expectations of hotel life. The staff need a bit more motivation about the priority of service and the hotel…
 September 2013,5,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"We arrived here from a few days in Marrakech and the difference in the whole area and in particular this hotel was fantastic. On arrival we were ushered to the sofas in the reception area and immediately offered a very refreshing cold towel and a glass of mint tea. All the registration process was completed in comfort and the receptionist was particilary friendly and helpful. Our car was parked across the road in a small section reserved for the hotel. Parking was free. The room we had was a pool view one and was spotlessly clean and very spacious. The balcony was well equippped with a lounger, chairs and a table. Perfect for a very pleasant start or finish to the day. The room was immaculate with a huge king bed. The quality of the sheets and pillows made the bed one of the…"
 September 2013,4,Lovely peaceful hotel - and smelt amazing!,"After Marrakesh, we found this hotel was a lovely peaceful break. Spotlessly clean (and smelled delicious - they burnt oil everywhere - seriously the best smelling hotel I've been to). Excellent breakfast. We'd have liked more veggie options on the menu for dinner (there was 1) and we believe it may have been cooked in animal fat as we were both suffering stomach cramps after - but as this is surprisingly common we wouldn't hold it against the hotel. The pool was lovely, it was a beautiful setting and the food tasted yummy. I had a fantastic massage. We used the spa pool and hammam and really enjoyed it - but we did wish that everything in the spa pool hadn't been turned off (we understand the restricted hours but do think that hotel guests who have been restricted to 7-10pm…"
 September 2013,5,Fantastic stay,"This is the third stay for my my wife and I this year at this hotel and every time has been a wonderful experience for us. We decided to splash out on an executive suite this time and we were not disappointed. The room was spacious well laid out and very clean. All the staff were exceptional, very friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble for them. Although my wife is Moroccan the staff still made an attempt to include me in the conversations by speaking English when they could. The poolside staff members deserve a special mention for taking good care of me whilst my wife was in the spa and hamam. There was also a fantastic guitar duo on, in the bar in the evenings. All in all a fabulous stay with great service."
 September 2013,5,I wish all Hotels were like this one,"Eveything about this Hotel was excellent. We received such a warm welcome upon arrival.The staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful at all times throughout our stay. Our room was perfect. We were given fresh towels in the morning and again in the evenings which was really appreciated with a young child. Having just arrived Yvout delivered a bottle warmer to our room for our baby's milk and a kettle for boiling water. Each morning at breakfast another member of staff, Samad (my apologies if mispelt) was very helpful and kind attending to our little girl which allowed us enough time to have breakfast before she would run off to the pool! The pool area was very relaxing and well attended to. The staff were great and we would highly recommend Le Medina Essaouira Hotel. The…"
 September 2013,3,Alright but in a great need of refurbishment,"We stayed 2 nights in this hotel in September 2013. Our first impression was: great location just outside the medina, opposite the beach. Nice, impressive building. Our room was very large with 2 balconies opening onto the swimming pool area. We had some fresh fruit and water in the room on arrival. Now, as much as we liked it, the whole hotel is in a great need of a refurbishment: the carpet in the hallway is dirty with black marks, bathroom looks (very) tired... We had dinner at the moroccain restaurant of the hotel - no choice, the whole town had no electricity. We thought this was a ripe off: overpriced food, taste was OK, but would have expected more for the price. Waitress was all smile until billing time as she did not know what to do with my discount card. Some of the…"
 August 2013,5,Just as good for second visit!,"I last stayed at this hotel two years ago for a week when it was a Sofitel. It was just as good this time and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I was given a personal welcome with a lovely large room with good sized terrace overlooking the pool. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and it was immaculately clean. The breakfast was delicious with a large choice and the bacon is the best I have eaten in years – so tasty!! Breakfast is supposed to be served from 6.30am, but on the two occasions when I went to eat at 7.00am and 6.40am it was not completely set up and there were no staff! However the people setting up were very willing and brought everything I needed – but nobody put the lights on! A TIP: If you are coming from Marrakech by bus – the Supratours bus terminal…"
 August 2013,4,"Nice stay, but...","We stayed at the Le Medina from 21st to 28th August and overall enjoyed our time there.The hotel isn't really a 5* more a 3*+. Having said that, our room was lovely (although the bathroom could do with a bit of TLC) and the housekeeping staff were excellent. Our room was spotlessly cleaned every day. Unfortunately the reception staff made you feel like everything was a little too much trouble and that you shouldn't really bother them. Breakfast was the usual fair and service was good although the coffee was tepid on arrival every day. Again staff here were helpful. A word of warning here I was ill on the last day (stomach bug!) and I put that down to the breakfast, actually the coffee as I only had coffee and croissants as it began about 3 hours after eating (and the previous…"
 August 2013,4,"Enjoyable stay, recommend this hotel","Had a great 6 nights at this hotel. Location is perfect, 2 mins walk from the medina and across the road from the beach. Staff welcoming and friendly, service sometimes a bit slow though you can't fault their attitude. Room was a good size and clean. Bed comfortable, wifi works OK, bathroom a bit jaded though clean and nothing really wrong with it. We didn't have dinner there though breakfast was above average (apart from the coffee which was nearly cold and dreadful, every morning!). Pool area a decent size and clean, nearly impossible to get a sunbed though. If they sorted the coffee and bought some more sunbeds this would be a great hotel. We'd go back!"
 August 2013,4,Good but needs some improvements,"This hotel has several very good features but is let down in some areas. Good points: the location is very good just a short 5 minute walk to the old medina and across the road from the beach. Being outside the medina meant that the hotel had more space for the pool area and spa etc. We had 3 rooms all of which were similar in size and the layout has been well thought through. The cleaning of our rooms was efficient and thorough. The staff on the front desk were really very helpful and, indeed, tolerant of my inadequate o-level French. The spa was very good. Food was a varied. Breakfast was included and was a decent enough spread but service could be a little chaotic. We only otherwise ate lunch there and this was not great and pricey for what it was. Drinks are also on the…"
 August 2013,3,"Lots of potential, excellent room, very bad service and little hospitality.","We booked into the medina to finish our holiday in morocco in a relaxing fashion. The room was wonderful, the swimming pool and sun beds were great for relaxing and I would happily recommend both of the above if it's what you're looking for. Unfortunately, the service at the hotel was not great at all. We were spoken to at reception rudely, never met with a smile and made to wait 30 minutes before even ordering our food. They even attempted to charge us an 8000MAD deposit on arrival for a 2000MAD stay. They were also unhelpful in any advice or assistance with the booking of continuing transport, telling us to walk to the bus stop to ask or wait for a taxi to drive past. This hotel has great potential but there is great need for work with the staff."
 August 2013,3,This hotel needs renovation and staff training,The hotel is supposed to be a 5 stars hotel and we guess that at some point it was. Now it is an old structure that needs some work done. The people of the reception are very helpful but the rest of the stafd even though they try...it looks like they can't make it. We checked in at 12 and we couldn't get our bags in the room until 15 and we asked them a few times. We went to swimming pool and we asked the staff 5 times to get towels and at the end my hubby had to grab them himself. The room was spacious and we had an upgrade to ocean view. The window was dirty...and the roon smell oldish. In overall I wouldn't pay more than 110 euro to sleep here...I noticed that the regular price for it was 370 euro!!!
 June 2013,5,Perfect for our short stay,"The MGallery Le Medina in Essaouira was a good change of scenery for my husband and me. After a couple of nights in a riad we wanted to try something different and this hotel served the purpose just right. It was a short stay so we were not that fussy, but we found our pool-facing room to be quite spacious and very clean, with a great view and a nice balcony. It was quiet enough and the bed was amazingly comfy, so we had a good night sleep. We had no major issues during our stay, but I would have to agree that there is room for improvement considering its 5-star status. The location is great, but few minutes away from the walls of the medina and the port. There is a private section of the beach, however the pool area is much better in my opinion - way cleaner and offering some…"
 August 2013,3,Certainly not a five stars !! I'd give it a 3,"Good location, nice pool (not enough seats), staff is kind, yet rather inefficient. Terribly run down, no charm nor attention to details, as one would expect from a five stars.i could go on. Better off in a nice Ryad."
 July 2013,3,Three star posing as a five star,"We chose to stay at this hotel due to its proximity to the beach and medina. In short, the location is great, but the hotel itself is in need of serious renovation and the staff are some of the worst I have come across in a number of years. From arrival until departure, the staff were rude, condescending and, at times, arrorant. One to avoid."
 July 2013,2,Needs a serious renovation as does the whole town,"The hotel was shabby and in serious need of a renovation. The carpets on the way to the rooms were nothing short of disgusting-you had no idea what you were walking on as they were covered in stains. The rooms were clean which was the main thing and we had a lovely balcony over looking the pool. The food in the hotel was poor and expensive. I would not recommend the breakfast as it is extremely expensive for what it is and you would be better off going into town to eat for a fraction of the price. There was no fresh fruit, it looked like it all came out of a can and the coffee was poor. On the 2 occasions we ate lunch at the pool the chips were cold by the time they got to us. The restaurant by the pool is inundated with birds and bird droppings."
 July 2013,3,Not bad overall but well worn rooms and poor service let it down,"Just returned from a stay at this hotel, the location is very good - directly opposite the beach and a short walk from the Medina. The busy road between the hotel and the beach does mean that sea view rooms like ours are really quite noisy, though. The rooms are a decent size but are very tired, the bathrooms in particular are really showing their age with fittings coming away from the wall and grubby, worn tiling and shower doors. The shower itself was good, though and the rooms were kept very clean. Excellent beds. Breakfast was good but suffered from the same poor service we experienced throughout the hotel. During the day it was not exactly made easy to get a drink by the pool, the barman in particular was surly and unhelpful and the waiter who seemed to always cover…"
 July 2013,3,"Good location and facilities, lacking in service and atmosphere","We chose this hotel partly due to its proximity to the beach, cafes and the short walk to the medina; all very useful during our stay. The private beach area was brilliant on less windy days and the attendant was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were kept very clean and new snacks were brought every few days. The pool area was very nice as was the solarium area and the spa. However, the staff were not very helpful at all, reluctant to serve drinks or food at extortionate prices. The reception staff were friendly enough and were very helpful, however bar and pool service was appalling. The lunch was very expensive and the food was not brilliant so we only ate in the hotel once. The staff tried to charge us for items we didn't receive and were overall fairly rude. The bar area…"
 June 2013,3,Good but no world beater,"Good hotel ticked most boxes but not going to win any awards. We had a nice 9 day stay here and the hotel was good without being great. Room was decent size etc with pool view, it was well located but service was at times a letdown which was common in Morocco we found. Some of the people there were great like the lady in the bar, the cleaners and one or two of the front desk. The pool attendants were good and friendly but some of the waiting staff not so great, one day I was waiting 10 minutes at a table for lunch with no sign of service at all I had to go looking for a waiter and found him sat on a table inside talking to another member of staff. Mini bar was very expensive and was not restocked daily. Prices of food and drinks are very high at €8ish for a glass of Moroccan…"
 April 2013,5,Loved the breakfast,We had a really spacious room with big bathroom and large balcony overlooking the pool area. The hotel was very clean and we had new shampoo and conditioner etc added to our bathroom every day. The hotel was across the road from the beach and was close to all the places we wished to go and we walked to them all quite safely. The buffet style breakfast was amazing with such a choice and possibly everything you could think of to eat and we ate outside by the pool each day. We ate so well at breakfast that we did not need to eat again until the evening. There was a Spa but we did not have time to use it.
 May 2013,4,Nice and clean hotel with good location,"It is a very nice hotel, clean, with beautiful flower arrangements everywhere including in our suit. Check-in process is very effective. We booked a sea view executive suit, of which the view was great, but the balcony is tiny. The evening clean service when they cleaned our bathroom after our after-beach bath has been very much appreciated; as we enjoyed coming back to a clean room in the evening. The location is perfect with a short walk to the medina in Essaouria, where there are many nice restaurants and shops. The reception staff is not friendly, nor helpful. On the first evening, I called asking for an extra bed-sheet, after 3 times explaining my wish; she understood what my need was and gave me a wrong number to call. This number was to the room-service, who then…"
 May 2013,3,Not bad not great,"After we had left a dirty Riad in the Medina we were happy to find this clean hotel. The rooms were good but nothing special. It is a kind of hotel we usually try to avoid but here it served wat we wanted, a place near the beach clean and friendly staff. We had dinner in the beach side restaurant which was good."
 April 2013,5,Excellent position-great hotel,"We spent 3 nights here in April after 2 nights in the Atlas Mountains. After a long and very hot drive from Asni via Marrakesh we arrived at Le Medina- we were greeted with steaming hand towels and very welcome mint tea, what a treat! Our room had a tiny balcony with a view of the beach and sea, very comfortable with a luxurious feel to it. Immaculately clean, air conditioning a welcome respite at night, clean towels daily and sometimes more often. Breakfast round the pool was plentiful and delicious, the pool was huge. The loungers got ""bagged"" fairly early but there were more on a different level above the indoor pool (which we didn't try, there was also a Hammam and Spa). There were roses everywhere and a wonderful scent of roses. The hotel is in a great position for…"
 April 2013,5,excellent quality hotel where the star rating is very accurate,We went here after five nights in Marrakech and as its on the coast the temperature was much nicer. We were however still in 28 degree heat and when we discovered the air conditioning wasn't working g we were disappointed. After mentioning this to the reception they immediately upgraded us to a suite at no extra charge. This was a fantastic suite with sweet gifts laid out on our coffee table every day. One night we were even invited to their cocktail bar which was free for an hour an had a live band but this is only reserved if you had a suite. The swimming pool was amazing and theyhad a free hamam for all guests. There is also an indoor pool which has SALT water which is heated to 35 degrees! It was very good. The only downside is that breakfast is an ecreate and is 18 euros…
 February 2013,5,WOUAW tout simplement,"I was there last February, I was lucky to have good weather, my title sums up the feeling I had when I woke up in the morning. beautiful hotel, exceptional city, especially if your room overlooks the ocean. good breakfast in beside the pool, especially with a radiant sun. do not miss this intense pleasure if you go through Essaouira make a small cuts out and go see ""Sidi el kaouki"""
 April 2013,4,"Lovely rooms, friendly staff","We spent a week at this hotel. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean and overlooked the pool. Easily one of the most comfortable Emperor sized beds we have slept in! Excellent breakfast in nice setting around the pool. Sun beds were very comfortable with good quality mattresses. Staff were helpful and friendly. Disappointed that the pool wasn't heated as advertised and was very cold. If visiting this resort, be aware that there is occasionally a cold wind blowing off the ocean which even if it is sunny and hot, brings the temperature down. You may need a fleece / warm jacket in the mornings and evenings. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel for comfort and cleanliness."
 April 2013,4,Nice hotel but lacking in atmosphere,"We had a room overlooking the pool which was very nice. Breakfast isn't included and was 18euros pp per day which was ridiculous as its just your standard hotel breakfast, but for convenience we paid it. Drinks and food expensive on site and lunch wasn't nice so go to the medina for your food. They have a bar that didn't have a soul in it the three nights we stayed here. We had hoped there would be a good atmosphere as it is quite a big hotel but it seemed to be very quiet. Pool area really nice, but not sheltered from the wind. You can help yourself to towels by the pool and the lounging areas outside are lovely. Nice little gym, indoor pool small. Seems like the biggest and best hotel in the medina area."
 March 2013,4,"Great location, great rooms and pool","Really enjoyed staying at this hotel with my family, The location was perfect...short walk to the old city and marina and across the street from the beach. Pool was beautiful. Service was just okay....no one went out of their way for anything. The spa was completely lacking and the people working at night at the spa was completely inept.....could there really be no towel at the indoor hot tub??"
 April 2013,5,very nice hotel,"Very nice hotel. Close to the old town and thebeach, not sure itsgreat value at full price butt we booked through expedia and were very happy. Luxorious room, lovely pool, nice staff. I would definitely come back here."
 April 2013,4,Perfectly located luxury hotel.,"Former Sofitel, just three minutes from the medina, ideal location if you prefer a hotel to a riad. Rooms were excellent and cleaned twice a day (despite what some other reviewers have said) with an evening chocolate! Possibly the most spacious and comfortable beds we have ever slept in! Lovely pool area with a variety of comfortable beds and covered loungers. Bar and restaurant to the standard you would expect, however we would recommend taking breakfast in the medina (ore authentic and much better value). Free wifi in the reception also reached our room and the pool."
 March 2013,5,Lovely Hotel,"My husband and I spent 3 nights in this hotel in March 2013. We had a double room on the 3rd floor facing the swimming pool, lovely, clean and spacious room with balcony and very good bath and cupboard facilities. The well furnished balcony made it a pleasure to sit there in the sun as well as around the swimming pool. We had breakfast around the pool every morning except one which we enjoyed inside as it was wet outside after a rainy night. Staff was very helpful, service was good and the common areas were a pleasure to relax in. The hotel is on the seafront and very convenient for beach walks, trips to the Medina, Restaurant and the Fishing harbour."
 March 2013,3,Enjoyable stay on the beach,"Wished to escape Marrakech for a few days, and wanted somewhere handy for the beach (as we have a toddler) with a decent pool/spa as well as being walking distance to the main town for restaurants and shops. This hotel was the only one which ticked the boxes, and we had a suite (two rooms) overlooking the pool. The service in the hotel was good and we enjoyed our stay. I think Sofitel have slightly abandoned this hotel (including dropping their name from the name of the hotel) to focus on their new hotel out of town, and I think that shows. Also the pool is too cold (compared to the Sofitel in Marrakech) and the drinks are very expensive. But no significant complaints at all."
 February 2013,4,Ideal,"A great hotel with very friendly staff, comfortable rooms, a lovely pool, plenty of relaxing/sunbathing areas, a decent spa and fabulous views of the sea and the old town. Its just close enough to the centre of town without being too close and a perfect place to base yourself and hide away from the bustling outside world when you've had enough!"
 March 2013,2,Give it a miss,The hotel is in a good location and the staff are very friendly.however the food was not up to scratch or good value....the worst part of the trip was the hotel was too mean to put the air condition on in our room or any of the guest rooms....they told use that the system was broken But one of the staff told us they do not put the air on until later on in the year..the temperature In our room was 75 degrees F . I lost sleep for the four nights we stayed there..
 June 2012,5,Great Hotel,"This Hotel was one of the best things about our trip to Morocco...We were greeted in the lobby with mint tea and smiling faces. Our room was beautiful and had a great view of the water and a nice balcony. The girls at the front desk were great and helped us in every way they could, My husband asked ""do you think it would be possible"" and before he could finish the question the girl at the front desk said ""yes"" whatever you like sir.... Great service"
 March 2013,4,Second stay here,"I stayed here for. Week from 9 -16 March after a lovely stay last year. I still rate the hotel highly but agree with some of the niggles expressed by other reviewers: 1. The coffee is terrible, they need to sort this one out. 2. Having wifi throughout the hotel for free is an improvement, but it is so slow that it's almost not worth having it. Elsewhere in Essaouira this was not the case. Our room was lovely, the staff attentive and the breakfast very good. For the price I paid (through Kuoni travel) it's excellent value for money."
 March 2013,4,Comfortable place to stay in charming Essaouira - the bed was absolute heaven!,"We recently stayed 3 nights in Essaouira at this hotel, which was, as anticipated, a little bland following an unforgettable stay in a superb traditional Riad in Marrakech. Having said that we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel`s excellent location just a short walk from the Medina and fishing port, the lovely pool, our well appointed room and bathroom, and possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in (definitely on a par with the Nile Kempinsky in Cairo!) We found room service was also excellent, but breakfast service a bit hit and miss - the poolside setting more than compensated for this however. Only disappointment was the beach restaurant on our first night, food ok but overpriced and restaurant had no ambience to speak of. After that we enjoyed trying various eating…"
 March 2013,2,Better Service at McDonalds,"The room was pretty, so was the pool. However, what makes a 5 star hotel an enjoyable experience is the service, which was severely lacking here. We walked into the restaurant for dinner. I wore a long sleeve cashmere dress that was below the knee. My cousin wore black slacks, a black blouse, and a black pashmina. My boyfriend was also appropriately dressed. Yet waiting for a table was a truly uncomfortable experience. Several members of the waitstaff made eye contact with us. Not a single person came over. After what seemed like a 10 minute staring contest, we walked over to one of the servers and asked if we should seat ourselves. She appeared flustered about where to seat us when there were 2-3 tables available. When we pointed to one with two seats, she seemed to…"
 February 2013,2,The Medina Spa Hotel IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL.,"I have stayed in numerous 5 Star hotels for both business and pleasure over many years and this hotel falls far short of any 5 star hotels I have stayed in. 1. The common areas are shabby and in need of refurbishment. 2. The breakfasts were abysmal 3. The staff were unhelpful and, in particular, the reception staff were very badly trained and informed. 4.The wi-fi was so poor that my husband had to miss an important international video call. The reason we booked this hotel is because it was supposed to have a good wi-fi connection – this was not the case. My husband was told this was normal for the town – this was not true as we found a very good and fast wi-fi connection in the town just standing outside a riad there. 5. The water was shut off between midnight and 5am on…"
 February 2013,5,Beautiful place to come back to after surfing/exploring,"It does stand out a little on the waterfront, but after exploring the city and surfing the amazing Essaouira waves we were very happy to come back to such a lovely hotel. The rooms were spacious and very clean, the bed and bed linen was about the nicest and most comfortable that I've ever slept in and the service and food at breakfast was really lovely. We had interconnecting rooms with our children which was perfect and each evening the kids beds were turned down and their soft toys tucked under the duvet, very sweet. The only slightly frustrating niggles were the speed of the wi-fi (painfully slow/patchy) and the slightly tetchy attitude of the staff in the spa. We didn't use any spa services but we went to look at the indoor pool and were not made to feel very welcome. The…"
 October 2012,3,"Good location, needs updating","We have stayed at this property previously when it was known as the Sofitel. The Sofitel chain has since opened a new super-luxury hotel just outside Essouira so this hotel was renamed and passed to another of their brands, probably to avoid confusion of the two. Anyway we decided to try it under the new ownership. In fact not much has changed except that with the passage of time the hotel has become a bit more run down, while its prices have gone up. It is still a very comfortable and convenient place to stay if you prefer a modern hotel to the many riads in Essaouira. The location is good, right across from the beach and a short walk into the old medina. There is a new associated restaurant on the beach across from the hotel. We preferred it to the hotel restaurant. As…"
 January 2013,3,Red Hotel in the White City,"The White City. For that to be a name for Essaouira is obvious looking down on it from a hillside viewpoint: dozens of white buildings, including a seaside line-up of modern hotels – all except our Le Medina Essaouira/Thalassa, [Boulevard Mohamed V. (212) 0525 07 2526. Its windows and entrance are outlned in red. It’s a serviceable elevator hotel with a pleasant pool and lunch area and the hotel makes an effort to welcome guests in a personal way, sitting down on a sofa to fill out forms. We had a nice little balcony overlooking the harbor and broad beach. But the service at the pool was both surly and nonexistent. It took three tries over an hour to get a drink. Overall it made us, well, homesick for La Maison Arabe in Marrakech."
 December 2012,3,Excellent location - too bad about the rest,"The hotel is situated on the beach front only two minutes walk from the old town but although Le Medina boasts 5 stars and high prices it is not a luxury hotel. General maintnance and cleaning leave a lot to be desired. Tiles are falling out of the bathroom walls and the carpets are disgusting. Worst of all, the showers are not working, a fact that has also been commented on by other guests. My wife went to the hairdresser at the hotel to have her hair washed, they also had a problem with the water pressure so the problem seems to be general. We had our young son with us and stayed three persons in one room but not once did we get three towels or three glasses. The floor in our room was never washed or sweeped during our one week stay. The staff is friendly and helpful but…"
 December 2012,4,LOTS OF LITTLE NIGGLES BUT UNDISTURBED OCEAN VIEW,"We booked 3 rooms, all of them were either stuffy and too hot to sleep in or freezing cold. Leaky pipes in the toilets and in the ceiling in one bedroom. Breakfast is rather unacceptable for 18 euros per person, cold coffee and watered down juice (from chemical powder anyway). At check-out we were charged for in room mini bar drinks that we had never touched...So all in all a nice hotel but be prepared for surprises, and it is by no means a 5 star de luxe hotel! I would advise to consider staying there only when the internet rates are reasonable and that guests keep copies of booking references, and keep track of every meal and drink at the hotel so as to prevent being overcharged. Excellent service and food at Dar Dada and Côté Plage."
 December 2012,5,Oasis,"Very efficient check-in, room with sea view was spacious but would benefit from double glazing some nights. Very comfortable bed although bedding not changed in 4 nights! Good size bathroom, separate toilet, very good shower pressure. Excellent buffet choice at breakfast, hot & cold. Ate in the promenade restaurant with beach views, great service and good food."
 December 2012,4,Lovely resort right near the beach.,"This hotel is spacious and clean, and well located across the road from the beach. Rooms are large and a bit dated. Nice linens and towels. Reception staff are all lovely we felt very welcome here. Nice pool area. Bar is dark and old fashioned."
 October 2012,3,"Nice hotel, good location","We had a nice time at the hotel, which has a really nice location, just by the beach, nice view if you have an ocean view room. What ruined the vacation was that I left my coat in the room, as we left the hotel. I wrote an e-mail and asked the hotel to send it to me, but I didn't even get an answer, not to mention the coat."
 April 2012,5,luxury in Essaouira,"If you visit Essaouira, which I would recommend; this is the hotel. We arrived by bus from Marrakech, and the hotel is some minutes from the bus station. We didn´t know how far away the hotel was, so we needed someone to take our luggage and show the way. There were a horde of pushing porters, but we managed to walk a bit away and got got it much cheaper. When we left the hotel we took the luggage ourselves. We stayed at the hotel for four days, and we felt we were in a kind of luxury heaven. The large room and bathroom, spotlessly clean. The balcony overlooking the pool and patio. nice breakfast every day outside or inside the restaurant. And excellent service the whole time, you were taken care of. perfect location for the beach and the Medina. The hotel has two restaurants…"
 November 2012,5,Great hotel experience,"My wife and I agree: Best hotel experience so far in Morocco. The hotel staff was particularly hight class and very helpful. The room was clean and tidy and the breakfast by the pool was quite satisfactory. The location by the beach and the close proximity to the medina of Essaouira added to the positive impression. But is was the staff that impressed us most. Calm, collected and always helpful. Something we have only experienced in boutique hotels in Asia."
 November 2012,4,Right by the sea,"This is an above average hotel, but not worthy of top spot. Right by the sea (but across a main road), with its own restaurant (but its associated restaurant across the main road was better. Breakfasts, in the main hotel, outside by the swimming pool (in November) appealed also to the sea-gulls and small birds, who were a nuisance."
 November 2012,4,Nice hotel,"We stayed for five nights, found the staff helpful, nice room overlooking the swimming pool, comfortable bed, quiet. The only problems we found , the safe sometimes difficult to set. Showe control not always easy, and problems with the toilet which was very quickly sorted. Enjoyed the breakfast, nice fresh fruit, and nice French bread and pastries. Would recommend this hotel."
 October 2012,5,Great hotel!,"This is the best hotel we have stayed in Morocco. Much better than the Sofitels we have tried in Fes and Marrakech. The location is perfect, just a few blocks from the Medina, which is very nice: no vendors trying to push you anything. The best prices in Morocco for any handicraft. Rooms have good size, the bathroom is large enough, yet they have the weird separated toilet. My balcony faced the pool, which is very pleasant. Staff at the front desk is unbelievably helpful, so is the breakfast one. Food is very good. Internet is free of charge all over the hotel. Only thing I didn't like is that they don't let you in the heated pool during the day. It's for spa use only. It was cold and we couldn't use the pool outside. It was a great stay. If I come back to Essaouira one day,…"
 June 2012,5,Great Hotel good location,"We have stayed here for 2 weeks in June this year. First we had the standard room, after 2 days there was a problem in the bathroom. They upgraded us a superior room, which was a great room to stay. Service is very good, aspecially Loubna Boubrik the Front Office Manager. The pool is very nice, although you have be there early in the morning to catch a sunbed. Along the beach there are some very good restaurants for lunch/dinner for cheap prices. It's about a 10-15 min walk to the Medina."
 November 2012,5,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,"We (family of 4) stayed in one of the exceutive suites at Le Medina. The room was very nice, clean and spacious with a good balcony overlooking the pool. We found the service at the hotel to be world class with highly trained and courteous staff. The outdoor pool was very nice and so was the hammam. The only letdown was the indoor ""pool"" which is just an oversized bath tub which gets extremely overcrowded after 7pm (which then becomes free to use)! Yuk! I am not sure why this rule is in place - managemnt would do well to lift this restriction. Essaioura itself is nice albeit a bit small, so 3 days would have been more than enough (we stayed 5)."
 October 2012,3,Shabby but not chic,"I believe this was a Sofitel before Accor rebranded it as part of its MGallery Collection. Quite what they have done apart from change the notepaper is not clear. This hotel is extremely tired and, in parts, rather grubby. The lobby area has a strange, and I suspect unintentional 70s feel. However, the location is perfect, being right opposite the beach yet within walking distance of the medina. And the food isn't bad. The pool is OK but surrounded with plastic decking that is now warping dangerously. Wifi worked only in the lobby, and the 25 euro a day wired internet in the rooms didn't work at all. Free wifi throughout a hotel is inexpensive to provide and to be expected in a hotel of this level. This is just a very poorly managed hotel, with no sign of senior duty managers at…"
 October 2012,5,Beautiful and relaxing hotel,"We stayed here for four nights and didn't want to leave! The first thing to say is that the location in Essaouira is ideal - just a short, easy walk from the medina, and very close to the Supratours coach terminal as well, so it's easy to wheel your own luggage to the hotel. You don't need a taxi or a barrow boy. The hotel faces the beach and has its own small private beach area, as well as a beach restaurant. I don't think you could have a better location, and we didn't need to use a single taxi during our stay. The welcome we received on arrival was the best I have ever had at any hotel. Our bags were politely whisked away and brought to our room (no tip was requested though I did give one.) The receptionist was charming and welcoming, speaking good English even though…"
 October 2012,5,Total relaxation at Le Medina Essaouira Hotel,"We spent three nights at this lovely hotel last week - we are a middle-aged couple travelling with our teenage son. From the moment we arrived we received nothing but the most excellent service. All of the staff are completely charming and seem to want nothing more than to make their guests feel fantastic! Our rooms were wonderful (we had 107 and 109, overlooking the pool but far enough away from the restaurants to be completely peaceful) - they were spacious, extremely clean and the beds were very comfortable, with particularly comfy pillows. The private beach area was lovely, although we were rather shocked at the behaviour of one guest who felt it was acceptable to sunbathe topless - and you could see that the hotel staff were uncomfortable with this as it is very…"
 October 2012,4,Brilliant Staff,"We were slightly concerned by some of the negative reviews but need not have worried. The hotel is perfectly situated five minutes from the medina and across the road from the largest beach we have ever seen. The rooms are large, comfortable and quiet and although the tiling in the bathroom left something to be desired, were spotlessly clean. We had chosen a pool view room but these all face in on each other so next time we would chose a sea view room to take advantage of added privacy and the view across the bay, along with the spectacular sunsets. There was a good selection at breakfast and, although the pool area was busy, there was usually space there or on the sun terrace above the spa. The hotel also had a private beach area where, when the tide was out, you could…"
 December 2011,5,Like home !,we have actually been there twice and going back in December it is right in front of the sea and the personnel is so friendly and nice it is like home the hotel is not too big and the massages excellent ! Loved it
 October 2012,5,Beach Brerak,"My wife and I both mid to late 60,s spent four days at this Hotel 7/10 to 11/10/2012.Parts of the Hotel are a little tired( Some carpets are not far from needing renewing and our bathroom sink had a crack) but more than compensated for by very friendly helpful staff. The food was excellent. Pool area could do with some more sun loungers but space is a little limited. Very convenient for the Beach/Harbour(mainly fishing boats) and the Medina.We found the resort safe and friendly although visitors should be ready for the sometimes less than hygienic Medina. The sea seemed to be popular (But we didn,t venture in) and the beach good for walking especially to see the starting points for Camel,Horse rides,Quad Biking and Kite Surfing."
 October 2012,4,"Gorgeous, welcoming hotel 5 mins from Medina","This is a lovely place, spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. It's a five minute walk along the seaside to the Medina, so better located than some of the more ""package holiday"" places further along the beach. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was perfect and the common areas (lobby, pool, hammam) were all lovely. Very comfortable bed, great bathroom. It was cleaned twice a day, but we were never interrupted by staff. Also, the place smells incredible - I think there is some kind of essential oil they have put into the indoor fountains and flower bowls. Jasmine? Only two complaints: 1) there is only wifi in the lobby, and the signal is terrible. Time for free wifi in the rooms! 2) We were lazy and ordered breakfast one morning, which was overpriced and not…"
 October 2012,5,Amazing staff who coped brilliantly in an emergency,"So, after our bags were delayed by 24 hours (thanks BA) the holiday got off to a ropey start, but the hotel really made up for this. We had a lovely welcome with cold towels and mint tea, along with concern about our bags. The room was a standard and was very large and very clean - we also had a great sea view as well. Beds exceptionally comfy too. The hotel and staff really did show their 5 star crowns when I tripped (over my own clumsy feet!) and broke my arm. I passed out and two room ladies who spoke little English did everything they could to help. One of the Managers, Amin (apologies if this is spelt incorrectly) called an ambulance and accompanied us to hospital, translating everything. He stayed until we were finished and then got the hotel car to pick us up. The…"
 October 2012,2,NOT A 5* HOTEL -THIS HOTEL HAS NO SOUL,"We approached the Reception Desk at Le Medina and were greeted by a young Lady while we were still some yards away from her, by name and with the comment, 'We have been waiting for you'. With hindsight, we think the Receptionist had been required to stay on duty, beyond the end of her shift just to check us in and wanted to 'process' us as quickly as possible. We were not offered any refreshing hot towels or welcoming drink. This is an extra service we accept, but in line with Arab welcomes we usually receive and we saw it given to other arrivals on subsequent days. We went straight into form filling. The form was detailed and in several languages and was in small print. The light was dim - as is my eyesight and hearing as I get older (!) - and the young Lady only wanted…"
 September 2012,5,Very relaxing,"We spent a week here after three days in Marrakech so were ready for some relaxation! We were greeted with hot towels and mint tea which was really appreciated after a three hour bus journey. We had a standard room which was very spacious, the bed was huge and as comfortable as everyone says. The room was very clean and the staff kept it that way throughout our stay. We didn't opt for breakfast as it is extremely expensive in comparison to elsewhere in Essaouira, however our stay would been improved if it was more reasonable as you don't always want to get up and go out first thing. We spent several afternoons at the hotel pool and never had any trouble finding a sunbed or large four poster bed to lounge on... the pool staff are very attentive and provided towels and drinks…"
 September 2012,2,definitely not 5*,"We stayed here for a week. While this may have been 5* once, it is no longer. The staff are lazy (apart from the pool boys) and don't seem to care, any time I approached them I genuinely felt I was putting them out. Breakfast will cost you 18 euros - pretty expensive for something pretty average. Room was nice, but a little tired. Bed was amazing - amazing, maybe the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in - but a bit tired, the slats in the base were loose and fell through one night. Generally the hotel is expensive and not very good value for money We ate in the Cote de Plage - unfortunately not very good, a bit bland, I had the beef and found that none of the food had basic seasoning. Generally, like others I'd say that this hotel is in need of updating - although I'm sure…"
 September 2012,4,Excellent hotel and made us very welcome,My wife and I have just come back from honeymoon at Le Medina. We had a lovely time there and were made very welcome. Us newlyweds were upgraded on arrival and we entered a lovely room with petals on the bed in the shape of a heart! Plus petals in the bath..both a lovely touch. The staff were very polite and courteous and friendly and made us feel very welcome and special! The room had a lovely view of the pool area and was very regularly cleaned. The breakfast was lovely with the lady in the restaurent churning out the crepes with Nutella yummy! We met Rachid the general manager who not only welcomed us and got to know us but sent a bottle of champagne to our room. That was such a lovely touch. The pool area was nice with those big comfy covered beds. I have 2 points of…
 September 2012,3,"Good location, but not fancy.","Great location (just around the corner from the Supratour coach station), good pool area. But don’t go expecting a UK 5 star hotel. Rooms pretty basic, but they have an amazingly comfy bed. Pool area is great, but not really big enough given the size of the hotel. An unoccupied sun lounger was a rarity and we stayed in the off peak season! A clean pool towel was hard to find. Staff in reception very lovely, but not really backed up by their colleagues. Immediately, means half an hour later if you are lucky! Rate doesn’t include breakfast which was a disappointment given the amount that was paid for the rooms. Essaouira is a stunningly beautiful place. The fish grill stalls by the harbour cook some amazing food. Just make sure you haggle on your price."
 September 2012,3,Tatty but comfy,"The reviews of this hotel had forewarned us that everything might not be perfect. Certainly, it does need money being spent on it. The carpets in the corridor are dirty and need replacing, the towels are grey instead of white, the tiles in the bathroom are grim. The rooms really need a refurbishment. However, we spent a week here and were very comfortable. The superior room was a good size and the bed/pillows lovely. We liked our large balcony, the private beach area and the sundeck. The location of the hotel was ideal. WiFi in the room would have been nice and we weren't able to get a signal for BBC World. Breakfast was just about adequate. Everything fell apart the morning a large corporate group were there. All the staff were polite."
 September 2012,5,Excellent,"There are two main hotels on Essaouira - Le Medina and the Atlas. We stayed at the Atlas for our first two nights but we moved to Le Medina for the rest of our stay because it was a better hotel (the Atlas was fine but a bit soul-less and the staff were not particularly helpful). Great pool, great room, great staff who were genuinely helpful. Highly recommend."
 September 2012,3,Few adjustments to be considered as a ***** hotel as is listed,"Good location close to the Medina. The service is ""indifferent from the front desk to really bad at the pool"". WIFI only in the lobby by the front desk. In the first floor, there is sort of a lounge, for the superior rooms. There, you have to purchase WIFI. How ridiculuos is that? TV channels, most of them in arabic and french. BBC and other english channels, conveniently, were not receiving signal, so if you need to know what is going on in the world, you must go down to the lobby for WIFI. Most of the employees are flat, few speak good english. Had lunch by the pool, service is inexistent, sort of speak. The kid that was running as a towel boy was also the waiter. Sandwiches took at least 35 minutes to arrive, waiter dropped the bottle of coca cola on us and on the floor and…"
 September 2012,5,Good Hotel in Lovely Essaouira,"Hotel very well located in Essaouira. Absolutely fantastic breakfasts, rooms lovely, even the 'basic' ones. Gym good. Not sure why we didn't get mint tea on arrival when everybody else seemed to, but small gripe."
 September 2012,1,Don't stay here if it is the last place on earth!,I recently stayed at this hotel and while the rooms are clean they are poorly finished and I am aware that they are trying to create a particular old world/medina look to the rooms which is nice but at the same time there is just poor workmanship throughout the room as well. I found my biggest issue with this hotel was the service it was hard to communicate with the staff members as they mainly speak French and not English most of the material in the hotel is in French including the price list in the spa and there are no English alternatives to read. The toilet in my bathroom broke on three occasions and I had to keep calling to get it fixed and on one occasion I reported it on my way our and requested they fix it while I was out but when I returned 5 hrs later they had not…
 August 2012,1,Not a 5*,"Bad food. Bad service. Hygiene poor. Breakfast terrible. Panckakes were pre-made and re-heated on order. When re-heating, the chef handled them excessively. The staff could not understand English. You ask for a boiled egg and you get an omelette. Pasta was served just boiled with a separate portion of sauce-which was about 2 tablespoons. Only one waiter was friendly. At the pool,you have to be vigilant that your place is not taken when you go for a swim for 10 minutes."
 September 2012,5,Go ahead,We spent 3 nights with my kids in a sea view room. It was very nice stay. We enjoyed the balcony during night and the private beach during day. Definitely we will take same hotel if return to essaouira. The only negative point is the service in swimming pool some latency in responding.
 July 2012,5,Charm and Style @ 5 Star,"We stayed at the Medina Essaouira Hotel Spa in July 2012 for a week, to escape the heat of the Marrakech but still experience the novelty of Morroco. The hotel is located on the seafront about 10 minutes walk from the walled town of Essaouira. The hotel is basically U shaped with the swimming pool sheltered from most of the trade winds within the walls of the hotel. The pool has great facilities with tents for those that want to hide from the sun and comfy beds - it's not a busy hotel so there's no fighting for the best spots. At the end of the pool is a raised solarium area with stone built beds and hammocks for the steady of nerve. As there is a constant breeze sunbathing is experienced without a tacky feeling but use a high factor cream as that southern sun is fierce. The…"
 August 2012,5,Excellent hotel,"This is a splendid hotel; I really enjoyed my stay here. Friendly staff and an excellent location right on the beach are welcome characteristics. The hotel itself is very well-appointed, not quite a 5* in my mind but a very good 4*. Private beach section is nice even if the amount of loungers is far too few (14 in total, and people just leave their towels on them and go off for hours so it's hard to get one). Rooms were very nice and lots of nice little things like the hammam to use, a sun lounging section with hammocks and so on, very good pool, nice bar for a drink, and all 5 minutes walk from the centre of town. Excellent room service breakfasts - the bread baskets are excellent value for a lazy start to the day eating breakfast on your balcony (every room has a balcony by…"
 August 2012,4,Loved it!,"Really loved this hotel from the moment I set foot in it. Greeted with mint tea and scented wet towels it set the whole tone of the stay. Beds were the most comfortable I've ever slept in, beautiful rooms. Clean pool. Lovely staff (except one grumpy one at reception). Great location. Comfy sunbed terrace. Lovely balconies looking over the pool. I would stay again tomorrow. It doesn't get five stars due to the fact that we could only get wifi in the lobby( although this was free), we couldn't get a drink in the bar at 9 pm in the evening and the extortionately priced breakfast 180 Dirhams each. Apart from these small details I would definitely recommend a visit and feel a bit mean for taking off a star for the small niggles. Room tax was charged at end of stay."
 July 2012,4,One of the best places in Essaouira,"The best hotel in Essaouira is Sofitel which is very expensive and kind of isolated. We went there for dinner, they have very hip gastronomique restaurants. If you're looking for a holiday much more cheaper, I can't suggest you Sofitel beside dinner. But Le Medina is hotel is one of the best places to stay for your holiday with its excellent staff. It's just on the beach side and close to the center. We had a ocean view room. The room was quite and clean. I really loved the beach and its attractions such as riding, surfing..etc. The breakfast is good. They serve great teas. The staff was very helpful and always smiling. Hospitality is one of the best word to describe them."
 January 2012,5,superb hotel fabulous location,Hotel is just a few meters from the old town and kasbah. Very close to port. Buffet breakfast but the restaurant is quite expensive compared to the value of very good places to eat and drink in town. Right opposite the beach but really too blustery for swimming. Lovely spa and Hammam
 July 2012,5,excellent hotel good location,Stayed for four nights in July the breeze was a welcome rest from the heat of Marrakech The rooms were spacious and clean with good views staff very attentive breakfast was very good pool facilities excellent but they run out of beds if you arrive at the pool after 10.30 they also have an excellent seafood restaurant on the beach the private beach needs some TLC it looks a little neglected i would definitely return.
 June 2012,5,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location!","Having spent a few days in Marrakech arriving here was wonderful. Excellent service at Reception and wonderful large room with dressing area and seating area. Comfortable beds and very clean. Room service staff are a credit, and treat boxes in the room were a wonderful daily surprise. We originally booked a few days, but decided we didn't want to return to Marrakech we preferred to end our holiday at this hotel, staff were wonderfully helpful and allowed us to keep the same room despite it being a new booking. Pool area is huge, plenty of sun lounging and shaded seating. Pleasant breakfast experience, very relaxed, and lots of fresh fruit. Avoided the restaurants felt they were pricey and there are plenty of other places in this windy city to dine. Enjoyed a couple of…"
 May 2012,5,Love!,"There are places you love the minute you walk in. You don't know exactly why, but it is just love. This is how I felt when I walk into Le Medina Essaouira Hotel Thalassa Sea & Spa. Everything seemed just right and I really, really liked the vibe of the place. We arrived without a reservation and were professionnaly welcomed by the staff who gave us all the infos we needed to choose to stay or not. We had selected a few hotels outside the medina prior to our arrival and had chosen this one because it seemed very nice and because it was closed of everything. Because of the way we were welcomed and because the hall of the hotel was well maintained and clean, we decided to stay. We were not disappointed! The hotel is designed a bit like a stadium, with the rooms located…"
 July 2012,5,Great Hotel. Pleasantly surprised!,"I was pleasantly surprised by our stay at Le Medina. The staff was very nice and professional.(Meryem at the front desk was very gracious). The rooms were clean, spacious and the beds are very comfortable. Little touches makes the whole difference and put Le Medina above its competitors. A genuine smile of the staff ( Surprisingly a rarity in the service industry in Morocco). Check in was very easy. The welcoming cup of mint tea and the rose scented fresh towels were very appreciated upon arrival. To sum it up, great service in a great hotel. Of course there is always room for improvement but I just hope that they can keep up the good work and avoid the trap of complacency."
 July 2012,4,Nice????,"We bought a deal online and arrived to Essaouira. The hotel is well located, the rooms are big, spacious and the breakfast is excellent. Two things I didn't like though, Our room (19) was on the ground floor. it was simply occupied by a tribe of ants. It was allover, on the wooden materials, on bed and bathroom. That bothered us a lot and since we stayed for 2 nights only, we felt it was uncesseray to change the room. Anyway nice place but will not return. One more thing, it is not pleasent to travel to essaouira between June _Sep time, It is veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy windy!!!!!"
 June 2012,5,Enjoyable stay,"The bad bits: Air con in room never did much to cool the room and when we opened the door to the lovely balcony for a bit of a breeze, the morning chorus of birds woke us at about 0400-0500; agree with another reviewer that the same CD seemed to be used every day at breakfast (but it was hysterical in that all the tunes were cover versions of hit songs - you haven't lived until you have heard 'I'm An Alien...In New York' sung with Moroccan backing group); can not these hotels make good coffee?! It was always doled out and pretty awful. The hotel's seaside restaurant - across the main boulevard and right on the shore - was not worth the visit. The good bits: Happy, welcoming staff; Moroccan air diffusers in use everywhere as well as exquisite floral arrangements throughout the…"
 July 2012,4,Nice little find...,"Escaped from a manic Marrakech and spent over a week in this peaceful, well situated hotel by the beach. Junior suite was very spacious, clean and comfortable, bottled water free and plentiful. Service in rooms, lobby and breakfast was very good, sadly poolside wasn't so great. Good selection at breakfast, and tea and coffee in the rooms. Could use some English translation however, didn't use spa because no one spoke enough English to translate their brochures! On the whole I recommend for a peaceful beach front break. (Oh, they could do with changing the darn in house Music once in a while :))"
 June 2012,3,"Okay, but not 5 star","Our experience of Le Medina was quite mixed although generally below expectations. The location of the hotel is great and the hotel looks impressive, is very clean and the staff are reasonably friendly. However, there is very little atmosphere, the communication to guests is very poor and even after 10 days they couldn't remember our room number at breakfast so not a lot of personal attention. The private beach is a joke and doesn't provide any value to the guests and the bar in the hotel is very dull. Much better to head into the medina. The restaurant in the hotel is good, the pool is good and the pool staff very helpful. Be prepared for very little English to be spoken as well. Annoyingly the air conditioning didn't work in the rooms although we were only told after a week…"
 June 2012,5,Relaxing and convenient,"Location cannot be better.Walking distance to Medina, and right in front of a beach. The room is clean and comfortable. Sea view room with a balcony gives you a feeling of a resort.The swimming pool is enjoyable. You can have a tasty and relaxing breakfast at the poolside. Service is perfect. Because of strong winds during my stay, I felt sands and dust on my skin after a stroll in Medina and beach areas. You can swim or take a bath and you feel refreshed again. You have to pay for the use of internet in your room.But in the lobby it is free of charge. I stayed with a discount with non refiundable reservation. So it was a bood deal. Otherwise it may be a little pricy."
 May 2012,5,La Medina Essaioura,"Great location opposite the beach and easy walking to the medina. Roped off area of the beach for guests with towels provided and guarded by G4s security although that did not seem necessary! Great swimming pool also with endless supply of towels and nice variety of sitting areas, not just sun loungers. All rooms cleaned to a high standard and staff all very polite and friendly. Probably only criticism is that it was quite difficult to attract attention at the pool for a drink or lunch menu. Restaurant choice was rather bland French or good ethnic Moroccan but with compulsory live Moroccan music to contend with. Overall we had a really good week there and would recommend a junior suite which was quite spacious."
 May 2012,5,Very very confortable,"Luxerious room, confortable,big balcony, nice lobby, Nice welcoming (Loubna was great). The outside pool and the furniture around is beautiful. I enjoyed everything. My only criticism is the cost of the food at the hotel. Breakfast or dinner is expensive.The spa treatments are expensive too I thought. Besides that, the hotel is very well located and accross the street of the quiet beach. By aware that room service is slow. I called them about 4 times and each time, there's was a long wait (ex: 20-25 minutes for coffee or orange juice...), or am I too impatient?"
 April 2012,5,Sofitel Medina Essaouira Morocco,"This is a very beautiful hotel, great service, great location. Great beds!!! Lovely light and spacious rooms."
 February 2012,5,Brilliant,My partner and myself stayed here for 3 nights afew trying afew riads. We were certainly not dissapointed. The staff were brilliant and could not do more for us. The price wasnt too expensive. Well worth it. Will deffinatly be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 April 2012,5,Perfect honeymoon retreat,"We were originally booked into a hotel in Essaouira but within five minutes of arriving realised that it had been massively oversold with small poky rooms and indifferent service. We were there on honeymoon and trying to make the best of a bad situation decided to go for a walk. We found Le Medina and thought why not check it out. The difference of service was incredible. We checked out of our other place and went to this one and didn't regret it for one second. They went to so much trouble to ensure we had the full honeymoon package - even though we were a walk in. Friendliness of staff, the facilities - just everything. I could go on about this place but why bother. I'll just make it really simple for anyone reading this. If you're going to Essaouira any time soon - BOOK…"
 April 2012,5,Absolute Excellence on Wind-blown Coast,"Just outside the romantic eighteenth-century crenallated walls of Essaouira stands this Gem of a Hotel, right on the Ocean Boulevard with marvelous views of Mogador and the Iles Purpuraires. Relatively far from the Marrakech airport, but a precise and efficient hotel driver was awaiting our (delayed) arrival and whisked us through the rainy night to the hotel in exactly 2 hours. Great and friendly, hospitable and expert reception. Everything was immediately taken care of; check-in took all of five minutes. Our spacious and quiet suite (some 40 square metres) looked out on the Garden and Swimming Pool; overlarge balcony; room equipped with everything you might need. The malfunctioning DVD-player was immediately (!) replaced; fine working table; several comfortable chairs and…"
 April 2012,4,Great deal,"We had a great stay at this hotel. The hotel, the swimingpool and the rooms are great, but some renovation is definitly needed. We got a very good deal on our stay, but the other services at the hotel (food, spa etc) are much more expensive than what you will pay most other places in Essaouira."
 April 2012,5,Fantastic hotel. Perfect,"We had an amazing time in Le Medina. It is a short walk from the main town but I wouldn't stay any other place. The pool area was heavenly and the bed like sleeping on a cloud. The decore in the hotel was beautiful and there was great attention to detail, including burning oils. Only down point was the food was pricey but you need to eat in town anyway. The fish stalls are brilliant."
 April 2012,3,Probably one of your better Western Hotel Options in Essaouira,"However, for a five-star hotel, it's not quite the level you would expect for that hotel level. It's a bit worn down. The service was ok, although the people were lovely and the location is fantastic, right across from the beach and easy walking distance to the souk. We originally booked a room with a crib for our 1-year old and an extra bed for our 5 year old, however when we arrived there was no way we would all have fit into the room they put us in (where there were no crib or additional bed to be seen anywhere). We upgraded to a suite, which was much better, but cost us an additional US$100 per night, a bit annoying as we disclosed our sleeping requirements when we made the reservation."
 March 2012,5,Nice hotel,The birds at the pool enjoy having breakfast served on the tables.
 March 2012,5,The best hotel in town!,"The superior room was as one might hope- superior! Le Medina is still an excellent hotel and the staff worked hard to ensure that my second stay was very enjoyable with lovely attention to detail, from the daily free trays of fruit/snacks and bottles of water left in my room, to the free hammam, well- equipped gym (so often run-down in other hotels) and lovely atmosphere around the hotel and pool. The whole place even smells beautiful and is great base to explore Essaouira. Having stayed at 5 other large hotels in town over the last 5 years I can say this is easily the best. Excellent!"
 March 2012,5,Just fabulous! Would definitely go back,"I am not sure what some people are looking for when they stay at hotels! My partner and I have just got back from spending 6 nights at this hotel and could not have been more pleased with our choice. We have previously stay at the Atlas which was lovely but Le Medina is something very special. We found the service to be excellent. The whole hotel was exceptionally clean and the room was beautiful. Very spacious and with a large balcony overlooking the pool. I would particularly recommend the sunbeds on the top terrace. The whole atmosphere was very relaxed, peaceful and the staff we very professional and helpful. Finally the location of the hotel is excellent being an easy 5 minute walk to the Medina. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Le Melina for a…"
 March 2012,4,Ideal Location,"We spent 4 nights here recently and were very happy with the location. A short walk to the Median and harbour but far enough away not to be bothered with noise. The service was excellent but the breakfast was nothing special. We had to ask for yoghurt and staff did not replenish food in the last hour of service. The bed was very, very comfortable and was huge! We would certainly go back there if we should find ourselves in Essaouira"
 March 2012,2,OK facilities but the service is useless,"Except at reception where the staff is intelligent and useful but the bar and pool staff is useles. We left to go to Atlas, which is only 5 minutes away and it was so much better overall (facilities, staff service, room size, food) So many examples why the Medina is a bit of a joke for a 4 star hotel: they served us liquid butter for breakfast (had melted in the sun), cuttlery was dirty, they made a mistake in charging us for the wrong items, we ordered drinks that never arrived by the pool, they charged us 5 euro to bring a bathrobe to our room, they tried to charge us twice the regular price for an extra stay of 2 nights, the toilet flush doesn't work properly near the reception area and in our room (blocked toilet), some outdoor furniture is broken (I nearly sat on an…"
 March 2012,5,Our 3rd. Time in Essaouira,"Our third time in this hotel. Previously it was the Sofitel, but now a name change, but still enjours all the benefits of the Sofitel. Staff are really helpful, and cann ot do enough foer you. Benefits from a small private beach, and if to windy an excellent swimming pool."
 February 2012,5,Great choice,As the hotel was not full I was immediately upgraded to a room with a balcony overlooking the pool. Lovely and quiet. Staff wonderful and always gave me my double espresso before I went on my morning jog ahead of breakfast. Pool a bit cold for swimming but I managed it anyway. Only disappointment was not being able to use the indoor pool until after 7pm unless treatments were booked. Recommended.
 February 2012,5,One of the best,"I absolutely loved this hotel. It was my highlight in Morocco. Great location, overall great service, especially from the SPA and restaurant. We arrived for one night but stayed two since we liked so much. There was only one down time...when I felt the reception was not helping with my questions about internet and breakfast in the room. But as the other things were soooo good, I definetely recommend you!!"
 January 2012,5,Very very good service...,"We stayed in this hotel for the first time in the summer of 2011, and since then, we've been back 3 other times... That tells you how much my husband and I loved it. Service is excellent. The staff is very friendly and helpful... They'll go out of their way to satisfy their customers... The Thalasso center is well organized and the treatments are very good. We tried all sort of rooms, from the superior room with pool view to the Prestige suite with sea view... Obviously, the best one was the suite, but the superior rooms are perfect too... And they have the best mattresses in the world... In any of their beds, you sleep like a baby... It's amazing!!! Overall, for me it's the best hotel in Essaouira and I recommend it to everyone..."
 January 2012,5,"Excellent hotel, excellent food in front of the beach","Great hotel and excellent service. Comfortable rooms with quite large well furnished terrace overlooking the pool. Toilet separate from bathroom.Free bathrobe & slippers. Lots of cupboard space.Nice outdoor heated pool 28C with many sunbed and shadowed loungers. Also indoor pool heated at 32C. Hammam with 3 different heath zones. Excellent breakfast; fresh fruit juice,on the spot baked eggs and bacon (not so often available in Morocco) and pancakes served with a moroccan delicacy sirup ""amlou"" (honey, almonds and argan oil). Good food. Choice between very good traditional ""cuisine"" inside the hotel or more fish oriented menus in the restaurant ""Côté plage"" situated in front of the hotel near the beach where the hotel disposes of a private beach strip with sunbeds. Well…"
 February 2011,4,Essaouira's Best Hotel,"Thoroghly enjoyed Essaouira, with a three-nights stay in February, 2011. Made good use of the balcony, not only facing the ocean, but situated above the main road and beach promenade - great for people watching. The hotel is fine for its purpose, clean and well appointed. Reception staff very friendly and efficient; however, dining room breakfast service was not very attentive, e.g., slow to clear used dishes, leaving us feeling somewhat abandoned at times. The supervised parking was much appreciated and the conscientious, caring parking attendants were always available when we needed them."
 January 2012,4,Lovely spa hotel by the beach near the medina,"Excellent Hotel in front of the beach with great views over the bay, short (5min) walk into the medina (main town). Very nice fresh water outdoor pool and a warm 35C indoor saltwater pool. We were also very impressed by the hamam (steam rooms). Plenty of sun beds and loungers around the pool and on the beach. Very spacious, clean rooms, we were on a special offer so were in an older room, which was still very nice. The rooms next door to us were all being renovated and the workmen were very considerate and did not bother us at all. There was a bit of a mix up about a transfer before we arrived, but it was resolved quickly and efficiently. All in all a very relaxing and enjoyable stay!"
 December 2011,4,"Excellent value, ideally situated and free supervised parking","We took advantage of an Internet offer on the hotel website and got excellent value for money. The inside room overlooking the swimming pool was large and quiet with a sizeable and comfortable bed. Like me, the hotel has seen better days, but it still has a lot to offer. A short walk to the old town and the port, the beach is just over the road, a very good light lunch in its beachside restaurant and a decent breakfast. It's easy to drive to and they park your car across from the hotel in a chained-in supervised area. The staff were all smiling and helpful. I didn't like check in though, as they serve you a tea but take your credit card away for a print; I don't like losing sight of my credit card. The decor is a bit worn here and there, but at the internet price it's…"
 January 2012,4,Very nice but not 5 stars,"nice hotel to explore Esaouira, well located however it hs got some issues. Bad bits most of the electrical sockets on our room were not working, some of them looked as they were coming out, and could be dangerous. The door nob to the balcony just felt apart when we tryed to open it. at night the reception looks very unconfortable, all lights out, and sleepy staff We had to fill in our own check in, wich never happened to me in any 5, 4 or 3 star hotel. There was no water or tea or cofee ofered in the room, and taking in consideration that the tap water was not very good they should offer the water at least. Good bits We were offered a upgrade once we arrived, to a room with pool view which was obviusly very nice. On arrival we were also welcomed with mint tea and wet tissues…"
 November 2011,5,An excellent place!,"Essaouira is great, and Le Medina offers a perfect homebase to explore it. Highly recommended in all respects! The ocean-view rooms overlook the relatively busy street, but they are never too noisy; the service is very capable and friendly. Overall, the hotel is just an excellent place to stay."
 November 2011,4,Peaceful haven,"We stayed here after 4 crazy days in Marrakech, and what a joy. It is opposite the beach, road not so busy. Night time was very quiet so great nights sleep. Maybe too quiet for some. 10 minute walk into town, where there are plenty of restaurants to choose from (Taros is fabulous). There is also a hotel fish restaurant on the other side of the road by the beach. Not much atmosphere, but food good. Breakfast 18euros each for the continental. More if you wanted extras. We decided it was a ridiculous price for lots of food we probably wouldn't eat, so took the 6euros/couple option and wandered over to the cafe by the beach and enjoyed the view and sunshine with our coffee, orange juice and pain au chocolat instead. Bed very comfy, staff friendly. There were very few…"
 November 2011,5,Woderful stay,"We stayed for 6 days between 13 and 19 November. Our booking was not made through the Sofitel website and there was a problem with the booking. Fatime at the hotel sorted this out for us very promptly and gave us a lovely room with large balcony overlooking the pool, I cannot thank her enough. The hotel is very relaxing and all the staff, from reception, to waiters, to porters were all charming, with nothing being too much trouble. Breakfast was excellent, with plenty of choice - all freshly prepared and beautifully presented. Everywhere was spotlessly clean and smelled gorgeous! We will definitely return to this hotel again."
 November 2011,3,"Not up to the standard expected, poor value.","The hotel is well situated close to the Medina and on the sea shore. Were were initially pleased with our choice when we arrived. We were cordially met at reception. However our room upgrade through the a club membership was to a larger, but poolside view room, which to my mind was not an improvement. Our bed was good, but the bathroom was poorly finished see pictures. The towels were thin and threadbare, and need to be replaced. Our breakfast was good on the first day, but when we came a bit later, was missing many of the items. Pancakes were prepared, and warmed rather than cooked fresh as one might expect. Some of the staff, the reception and beach staff were helpful, but others were surly to the point of rudeness. We had travelled a long way to enjoy this hotel, and…"
 October 2011,3,Great staff but not 5*,We spent 5 nights in this hotel and the staff really stood out as excellent. I would not rate it as 5* star as although the rooms were kept spotlessy clean they are a bit worn around the edges; peeling paint in the bathroom; loose tap and loo roll holder for example. We had a sea view as we prefer to watch the sea and the world go by and are happy to compromise the quiet of a pool view room. My husband was ill (something that can happen anywhere) and the staff were very quick to arrange a doctor and collect medication. Hotel is a short walk to the medina and has a very small private part of the massive and georgoeus beach. Pool area is serene. Food is 5* prices but not quite worth it. The staff and location make this hotel worth visiting.
 August 2011,4,Good relaxing holidays,"We stayed at the Sofital in August 2011 for 1 week, the rooms were good even though you would expect a little more from a defined luxury hotel, the restaurants were good so as the buffet breakfast. Nice staff very friendly and helpfull. The swimming pool did not have enough sun deck chairs and you had to wake up early if you wanted to have one... All together a nice stay."
 October 2011,4,Sofitel Essaouira - an oasis outside the medina,"Very nice hotel in a great location. Friendly and clean, choice of restaurant somewhat limited and food average but staff nice and lovely pool and gardens. Walking distance to the medina - and rather nice to be away from it! Good size rooms and bathrooms, corridors a bit worn."
 October 2011,4,"Great location, a bit shabby but cheap deals make it worthwhile","Chose this hotel as it was on the beach, had a pool & was close to the medina. We found a really cheap deal online which made me happy to overlook the shabby decor. Our 4 year old son loved the pool & easy access to the beach but unfortunately the childrens suite was closed while we were there. There was a playground on the beach which he enjoyed & it was by a cafe which was nice for the parents. The hotel menus were not appetising at all & so we ate every meal out. (even the expensive hotel breakfast was very average, we only had it on one day) Luckily the medina had so many great places (we found them using Trip Advisor) that we were spoilt for choice. I would recommend this hotel if you paid the discounted price but I think it would be disappointing if you paid the rack…"
 October 2011,5,A very nice hotel,"This is a very nice hotel in Essaouira well located by the beach, very near to the town and medina (5-10 minutes depending on how fast you walk!). The rooms are large and the beds are wonderfully comfortable. The hotel is very clean. The pool is great. The food in the restaurant by the beach is very good, but a little pricey compared to restaurants in the medina. The staff are always smiling, professional and are very friendly and helpful. They even gave me a birthday cake on my birthday! The only small negative points: The bar was gloomy and lacking in ambiance, despite a musician doing his best! It would be nice if one could have drinks by the pool in the evening, which was not the case. The Accor Hotels website advertises free transfer from Marrakech airport for stays…"
 October 2011,3,"good location, average service for the category of the hotel","good location, outside the walls of the medina, which proves convenient of you are not too much into living the medina style and prefer modern accomodation to the local experience such as riads. The service is average though as these examples illustrate: - we wanted to use the swimming pool but no one attended to us, we could not find clean towels, and no one was there to talk t - breakfast is really average , i did not find the products featured fresh such as brioche (all rigid and hard) , or croissants - waiters tend to forget your order at brekfast and simply look overwhelmed or distracted by the number of tables assigned - we wanted to use the private space on the beach reserved for guests, no towels, the hotel employee had to go back to hotel to bring new ones.. well, it…"
 October 2011,4,Good 4 star,Hotel was what I expected really. Location was great right on the lovely long beach. The air conditioning in our room was not working - we told reception and the up graded us straight away to a junior suite. Both rooms that we had were lovely. Nice and clean service was good. The beach restaurant was lovely and well worthba visit. It's got a good location a short walk along the beach to the medina.
 September 2011,4,Great for a relaxed break,"The hotel is a 5 min walk from the old town- along a nice stretch of beach. This makes it perfect for exploring, but also quiet enough to sleep and relax. The pool area was very quiet when we were there. The rooms comfortable. And the service amazing. Although some reviews say the decor was tired- i think it looked the same as the photos. It isn't a ultra posh or sleek hotel- but very nice all the same. We really enjoyed our stay. Only negative, is the cost of food/ drink/ spa. These are 3 or 4 times as expensive as you can get in the town at very nice places. There are some great restaurants to discover. Highly recommend Elizar and Caravane Cafe for dinner."
 September 2011,1,Dilapidated and Disappointing,"My wife and I went to Essaouria on our honeymoon and expected the Sofitel to be consistent with the high standards we are familiar with from our other experiences at Sofitel Hotels. Unfortunately the property in Essaouria, Morocco is inconsistent with the purported standards of Sofitel. The property is extremely dilapidated (see pictures). While the common areas are in generally good conditions. The bathroom in our suite was disgusting, and the carpets were filthy. The air conditioning did not work in either of the two rooms we were placed in, and we were forced to sleep with the door open. The staff prohibited us from the hot tub during day light hours (how is that possible at a spa?). We cut our three day stay short and left after one night, it only took us 2 hours to…"
 September 2011,3,Tired but great pool,A hotel definitely in need of a renovation. Rooms are large but somewhat old - our fridge had to be replaced and air con didn't work well. But overall good. Staff are brilliantly friendly.
 September 2011,4,Perfect stay for relaxation,"First time in the Sofitel and was not disappointed. The location is good, 1 for a easy walk from the Supra tours bus that we arrived from Marrakesh and 2. just outside the Medina, but only a two minute walk along the sea front. The hotel offers its guest free sunbeds on the beach with free towels, which is great for keeping the weight down on your allowance. The pool and sunbathing area is wonderful. The most important point about this hotel would be it's staff. They do go the extra mile to please your every wish, all the staff we met are friendly, helpful and enjoy talking and exchanging with its customers, from the moment you arrive to the point of departure. Food is lovely and plentiful, and yes i agree with other Trip adviser's that the breakfast is overpriced, however…"
 September 2011,5,Bordering on perfection,"Having stayed in another Sofitel hotel in Morocco we knew what to accept, ie a quality and luxurious hotel that surpasses some other five star establishments in the country, but yet doesn't quite match up with five star hotels in europe, as none of them do in fact. This one actually exceeded our expectations though and if it hadn't been for some areas of the hotel being in need of a lick of paint and looking a bit tired, we could have thought that we were in a luxury hotel in Europe. The staff were impeccable,achieving a perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism,and appeared to be fluent in several languages. There were some great extra touches in our room too, like free bottled water and delicious nibbles and fruit. Our room had a pool view and a lovely good-sized…"
 September 2011,5,Very well managed hotel in a very special city,"Sofitel is far from the cheapest place you can crash but it is possible to find good deals for this hotel online (I booked through Splendia) and the quality of this very hotel is hard to beat. We arrived by bus from Marrakech in the early evening. The Supratours bus station is a five minute walk away from the hotel so we walked although we had heavy luggage (luckily with wheels). Were received by a smiling porter who took care of the luggage, a most smiling receptionist and her male colleague who handed us damp towels while we sat down to register in the beautiful lobby with a nice smell of flowers. We had asked for a pool view room on a high floor. Got room 239 which was really nice. Great beds, lots of room, good closet space, minibar, safe (free of charge of course),…"
 September 2011,4,Very comfortable,"The hotel is everything I expected. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. If you book early you have rooms wich are not so expensive. We payed only 73 euro a night and were upgraded tot swimmingpoolside. Breakfast is expensive (18 euro per person) but good. The beds are great. We travelled 3 weeks through Marocco and found the bed everywhere very,very hard. Here is was like sleeping on a cloud. Really good. What I found not so good was the airconditioning. At night it was warm en the aircon didnot work very well. Also it was quite diffucult to find a good temperature under the shower. The water was tot hot or to cold and in the morning there was a smell of food in our bathroom. The service in the hotel is extremly good."
 June 2011,5,Great getaway and excellent staff,"We stayed here with our two year old daughter and were received like royalty. Our daughter received an enormous amount of attention from the staff and we felt as if we were part of a family, more than just guests. The staff picked up on our moods and provided service out of hours if we needed it and were always polite and friendly. Although Sofitels' are not cheap, the service, cleanliness of the hotel and rooms, the food and the facilities more than justified the cost. Very well situated, just a five minute walk from the medina in Essaouria and the numerous restaurants there, and with its own private beach and beach restaurant in front of the hotel, it provided just the sort of pampering we needed after a stressful six months."
 July 2011,4,Does not look like PHOTOs,"The Hotel is fairly old one.(Very different to what their pictures show).But the location is very nice (5 to 10 minutes walk to and from the village),and aslo they have aprivate beach,eventhough it is very small.All the staffs are very helpful,and are keen to do so.Their (new) Fish restaurant on the beach is very nice and hasa very good value to try."
 February 2011,3,Not where I would choose for a return trip,"The Sofitel is in a good location if you don't want to be in the middle of the town, but is only a short, pleasant stroll away. It's located just across the road from the lovely sandy beach. We didn't think it deserved a 5* rating, as it's a bit tired in places and has limited facilities. The gym was closed during our stay and there was no alternative. This may not be a problem for everyone, but my husband was in training for a triathlon, so this was one of the draws for the hotel. The breakfast buffet was good and service was very good. Smoking was allowed in the bar which spoilt it for us non-smokers. However, they did have a couple of good young musicians playing there one evening, so that made a pleasant change from the piped musak they insisted on playing in the lobby!"
 May 2011,4,Quality hotel in a great setting,"This is a stylish and comfortable hotel, well positioned by the beach and a short walk to the historic part of town. I would suggest consider booking a superior pool view room and not pay the extra for the sea view as these face onto the road and have a tiny balcony with no shade or shelter. Surprisingly there is no tea or coffee available in the room and a very limited range of products are provided in the bathroom. However the room was comfortable and all the staff were really helpful, particularly at reception. Breakfast by the pool is a relaxed treat. The hotel restaurant by the beach has a great aspect with nicely presented food, definitely worth trying although there are some very good restaurants in town. I would recommend Taros beside the main square for lunch or…"
 April 2011,5,A gem of a hotel in a beautiful place.,"This is a great hotel where attention has been paid to detail. The service we had was excellent and all the staff we encountered, including those on the reception desk, were efficient,helpful, polite and cheerful. The manager definitely has his finger on the pulse here and things happen seemlessly. The room was a good size with an enormous bed that was extraordinarily comfortable and easy to get lost in. The food in all the restauants was excellent, the view of the floodlit beach from the hotel's fish restaurant on the prom across the road was spectacular and a lasting memory. At breakfast if you are outside don't leave your croissant unattended for the seagulls are keen. The hotel has a spa and the shape of the hotel is designed to provide shelter from the winds that can blow…"
 June 2011,4,We rate this hotel,Great hotel in a perfect spot. We stayed in a Riad in marakech & booked this hotel on the beach instead of a riad in Essaouria & are glad we did. The Medina becomes a bit much after a while & was nice to chill out. Good pool & room overlooking the beach.
 December 2010,4,Great hotel in superb location,My wife and I spent 3 days in Essaouira staying at the Sofitel over Xmas 2010. The hotel was superb in all respects; we had s superior room overlooking the sea and the most comfortable bed ever! The bedroom was a very good size with a nice balcony with seating for 2. The bathroom had extremely good sanitary-ware and plumbing but was slightly let down by the shower which managed to leak onto the bathroom floor no matter how hard we tried. The breakfast was very well presented and of high quality. The pool and seating areas were very attractive and the spa was great. The staff were just fantastic. All in all a really enjoyable stay.
 December 2010,4,Just wanted to say the manager was first class.,"We happened to be there in the middle of a terrible windy rain storm and had a few problems. The manager, a sharp frenchman, stepped up and was so professional in helping us get everything right. More hotel managers should be like him. Thanks for your thoughtfulness."
 November 2010,3,"Average 5* hotel, unhelpful reception staff.","We arrived at the hotel to a very formal check in process where we were sat in the lounge and asked to complete a reservation form. I imagine they are trying to offer a 5* service but in fact the check-in process was worse than a standard check-in procedure. Firstly we were not given a pen to complete the forms, we were then given a room key and not told any information about the hotel; breakfast times, check-out, hotel services, etc – I even had to ask where the lift was. Each time I approached the hotel reception I found them very unhelpful and a little dismissive. For example; I wanted to make some calls but was not sure if it was cheaper to use the hotel phone or my mobile, I asked reception the average rates for calls/connection fees and was told 'I don’t not know' when…"
 November 2010,2,Nice location but....,"Rudest reception staff I have ever encountered in any hotel in the world. On checkout I was treated like a criminal because I didn't know how many items had been taken from the minibar. Absolutely disgusting, never been so insulted Was refused the romantic gift which was supposed to come with the room booking with a ""NO you're not having it!"" Night before we were awoken buy a very rude man at reception saying I was drunk and banging doors, jumping over the balconies and making a nuisance. I informed him that I was asleep in bed with my sick 3 year old child and then he quickly hung up realising he'd got the wrong room. This hotel is in a nice location but is badly let down by the poor service. On the first night we ordered a childs crib and an hour later was brought a crepe!…"
 October 2010,4,"Really nice hotel, food could do with improvement as it is over priced","Great location, lovely rooms, nice pool, they even invited all the guests for drinks one night to celebrate a staff members b-day All in all great place, the only area lacking a little was the food"
 October 2010,5,Everything you'd expect from multi-starred hotel; close to beach,"We got a decent deal on Expedia, no breakfast included but no issue to walk 5 minutes to the medina and choose from all the cafes there. Swimming pool area does not get the sun all day, pool was therefore pretty cold but it is long and good for ""proper swimming"". The fitness centre looked well-equipped. Room and service were excellent. We stayed in riad-style accommodation in Marrakech which was a great experience, but decided to choose a more mainstream option here in order to get the pool and king-size bed, and didn't regret it!"
 September 2010,5,Absolutely perfect,"We stayed at the Sofitel for 3 nights in September. After arriving at Marrakech airport and dealing with sold out buses and over charging taxi drivers we paired up with 2 British ladies and shared a petit taxi from the Supratours bus station to the centre of Essaouira (dropping us off on the way). FYI we paid 800dh for the trip that takes about 2.5 hours. We arrived at the Sofitel and were greeted immediately with a mint tea and moroccan biscuit. The reception staff were efficient and helpful with good English. In no time the bell boy took our bags up to our 2nd floor room. The room was spacious, well decorated and clean, absolutely no complaints. We had a view of the pool which looked quiet, calm and made us dump our bags and get straight down there after a long morning. We…"
 September 2010,5,"World's comfiest bed winner!! Hotel great, food and drinks overpriced though","Great hotel in Essaouira, only a 5 min walk from the Medina, but as a result it is much quieter than being right in the Medina. Restaurants and drinks were hugely overpriced (£5 for a beer and £10 for a mojito) but the pool and bed make up for it. The bed is so comfortable, we could hardly drag ourselves out of it, down to the double bed sunloungers downstairs. After our mistake eating in the hotel beach restaurant on the day we arrived (very nice, but hugely expensive), we ate out every day breakfast lunch and dinner in any of the multitude of great restaurants and cafes nearby."
 September 2010,5,"Excellent stay: perfect location, great service, calm oasis","I spent 2 nights here last week and had a fabulous stay. Customer service in the hotel was excellent, rooms were beautiful, location was perfect and the pool area was just lovely. I really do not understand the negative comments, I remember one i read was re the TV channels but the TV had english channels, one was an English film channel. Another was re not having French; i have in total about 30 french words and though I used them! each member of staff had English and was very happy to speak to me in English. Also, a huge bonus was that the hotel offered different excursions, some of which were complimentary. The one that suited me day wise was a complimentary guide for a 2.5 hour tour of the Medina. There were 8 of us, I was the only person who did not have French so our…"
 August 2010,5,Wonderful experience,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel from beginning to end and would highly recommend it to friends and family. Staff & service excellent - the staff couldn't have done more to make us feel welcome and provide excellent service from the moment we arrived. They were charming and nothing was ever a problem. I speak French and my husband makes the effort and I think this goes a long way when visiting a country where their second language is French (particularly whilst staying in a french chain hotel). Sadly neither of us speak Arabic but we learn't a few words out of our book and this made people smile. Excellent room - it was spotless throughout, bed was extremely comfortable. We had a room on the ground floor with a view of the garden/pool. We had a lovely…"
 August 2010,3,Ok.... just,"Con's, Much of the hotel is very dated. 2nd floor corridor had a strange smell. Carpet was filthy, door lintels had huge scratches, chips and gouges. While the room was spacious and clean it was old and in need of refurbishment, as was the bathroom, though again spotless., Tiny balcony, though not much can be done of course. Lack of pool loungers. This could be improved within existing space. By 10am all loungers had been taken or reserved. Not an issue as we preferred the beach Private beach was a disgrace with broken loungers of varying types and condition, A number were broken and could not be used. Again a shortage which could be rectified. The real disgrace however was the total lack of beach cleaning. Over the 6 days of our visit the area was not raked once and cigarette…"
 July 2010,3,A home from home - if you're French!,"This hotel was not our first choice in Essaouira from the brochure, however, after reading some poor online reviews of our first choice, our Travel Agent persuaded us to go with the Sofitel. On the whole, the hotel was Ok, but there were several aspects of it which meant that it did not quite live up to our expectations of this rate of hotel. Firstly, it was VERY French. Not surprising as it’s a part of a French owned chain (If we’d known this before we booked, we probably would have sought another hotel). The first language of all the staff seemed to be French, all the menus were in French only and there was an abundance of French speaking TV channels with only two English [news] ones. I have no idea what spa treatments were available as all the information about the spa was…"
 June 2010,4,Excellent stay however a few finer points...,"£1 = 13dhs The hotel is ideally located 200 yards from the old medina wall, it is directly from the beach however it does cross a lane of busy traffic to the private beach. The hotel has concierge, restaurants, internet lounge, indoor and outdoor pool, gymnasium and currency exchange. The indoor pool is only available to guests between 7pm and 9pm and the Hamam is free to use. One tip: we stayed half board and because there are so many great restaurants in the city we swapped dinner for lunches in the hotel - if you do that make sure you order the 3 courses your entitled too! We had a classic room with pool view on the ground floor and the room was big with a very large comfy bed, seperate toilet room, big bathroom, lots of cupboard space, flat screen tv and desk and chair…"
 June 2010,3,Poor service was key problem,"Having enjoyed a wonderful few days at a riad in Marrakech during our honeymoon, my wife and I appreciated the calm of Essaouira - although we were surprised at the poor state of the road down to the coast. Our first impressions of the Sofitel were very good - it's in a fine location, on the promenade, a few minutes from the harbour. We were greeted by staff with mint tea and cooling towels, and a porter to take our bags. The hotel was airy, smart and clean, with reading lounges overlooking the sea, a private beach area and beautiful drifts of flowers decorating the pool. Our room was well-furnished and quiet, and cleaners made frequent (perhaps too frequent) visits to turn down the covers and leave a tray of snacks, etc. However we formed the impression that the staff seemed…"
 June 2010,4,Slightly disappointing money making enterprise,"First impressions on arrival , after a 3 hr journey from Marrakech,( on a largely unbuilt road!) were very pleasant. Light & airy, & welcoming with wet towels provided to freshen up. Our room too, on the ground floor ,27, was also close to the bougainvillea & the dawn chorus was deafening even with the windows closed & air conditioning on! The shower head was very poor & it was impossible to use it or the hand shower without flooding the bathroom floor. The orange juice at breakfast was very disappointing as it was watered down. After the delicious fresh juices we had been provided with in Marrakech, this was unnecessary. There is hardly a dearth of oranges there. But breakfast was buffet style & there was plenty of choice. It was good to see an egg chef who cooked the eggs…"
 June 2010,5,Good atmosphere in good location,Typicall high class hotel with all expected service. Very broad beach just opposite the street. To entrance of medina and port not even 5 minutes walking distnace. Very friendly personal always keen to provide services. Very extensive wellness facilities. Pool without wind. Food is very good but there is similar quality in town for a lower price. Guest average age wide ofer 50.
 May 2010,4,very nice on first impression but no 5 stars,"As title very nice but a few hitches not worth a 5 star hotel no coffee/tee facilities, showerwall on bathtub was not adjusted so that the whole bathroom was wet after shower, after cleaning with towel, towel was black which prooves that it was not very clean, only first impression is nice. Lightswitch was dirty on bedside. Had room 135 +137 which I would not recommend as birds are waking you up even before 6 a.m. as bougainvillae plants are planted along the walls of your balcony.Nevertheless would recommend it as it is probably the best you can get in Essaouira but ask a room far from the bougainvillae. Huge positive point is the private beach and all the friendly staff."
 May 2010,4,Excellent service et lieu paisible,We came for a peacefull stay for one week. Room were very nice & we appreciated the sea view. Very godd service during all the stay. This hotel is a very good value for money.
 April 2010,5,Perfect,Luxury hotel and especially imbued with human warmth. All staff are respectful of your comfort and you are greeted with friendliness. I had the opportunity several times to go in different sofitel but I recommend especially that of Essaouira. The reception staff was professional and helpful.
 March 2010,5,What's the French for 'hauteur'?,"We stayed for four nights and were hugely underwhelmed. True the Moroccan staff were polite and smiley but the French management, especially at reception, was distant and, disinterested. It's a money making machine: you pay for everything and you pay a lot, the breakfast for example could be bought better and for a quarter of the price in town. When a gold ring went missing from our room we reported it to the management, admitting that we should have put it in our safe and stressing that we would not be claiming, they suggested we'd lost it and that 'it would probably turn-up' but they'd investigate and come back to us. They didn't. In fact the only time they showed concern for us was after we paid the bill and they discovered they hadn't charged for two tonic waters which…"
 February 2010,5,cheerful helpful comfort,"Stayed here for 8 nights and found the level of comfort and helpfulness in the hotel to be exceptional. Friendly staff; couldn't do enough; genuinely warm and helpful people. Food is excellent! Only drawback was that we chose the hotel as it has an indoor as well as an outdoor pool: the indoor pool is booked the entire day for thalassotherapy sessions and is only open to mere mortals between 7-9pm. Outdoor pool is lovely - but weather-dependent. Essaouira is extremely pretty and hotel is within easy walking of the medina, souk, harbour etc. Long westerly facing beach, subject when we were there to the Trade Winds that rocked Madeira - however sun soon appeared and it was between 19C and 28C most days. Perhaps in the future we would combine this town with Marrakesh or Fez…"
 February 2010,5,"modern, clean, pretty, excellent service and food","We spent 5 days here after being in marrakesh in a very traditional riad, so we had a nice combination of traditional and modern. Fresh flowers around the hotel, very clean, staff very polite (some spoke more english than others), complimentary mint tea on arrival, free safe in room, lovely view to the sea from the terrace. 5 minute walk to medina walls, private beach area. Beach and pool area had big hammocks, day beds and sun-loungers, with fluffy towels. Very comfortable bed. I had a black soap scrub in the Hamman, which was lovely (cost about £16). We also used the basic, but functional fitness room, and the pool - which was nice if a little cool. We were half-board, and the food was lovely. Many people had water with their meals (£2.60 for litre bottle), perhaps because…"
 August 2009,4,Fun place,"This Hotel was much better than we expected. It is clean, nicely designed and not too far from the centre of Essaouira. It is great for families having children as it is close for the beach and has a nice (but cold) pool inside its boundaries. The children were allowed in the spa after 7pm. We were booked in as half board and the meals were excellent. There was a choice of restaurants including a fish restaurant on the beach - our favorite. If you are not half board it is probably one of the most expensive restaurants to eat in Essaouira. Best to have the HB option."
 November 2009,4,"Clean, functional, well equipped but lacked atmosphere","The Sofitel in Essaouira is a typical modern hotel. It is built in typical hotel style (a cross between Tesco with a hint of early Gatwick) and looks a bit like a multi storey carpark with curtains. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped, the staff are efficient and smiley, everything is provided for your comfort. There really is nothing to complain about. I feel a bit guilty that I didn't like it. Having spent nearly a week in the insane hustle and bustle of Marrakech, coming to quiet, laid-back, charming Essaouira was a pleasant culture shock. The hotel is well situated a short walk from the Medina. It has its own small private beach where attentive staff scurry about, brushing sand off your sunbed and laying out your beach towel. Reception is large and airy and totally…"
 October 2009,5,excellent hotel wonderful service and friendliness,This hotel is one of the best we have stayed in we had half board and ate every evening in beach restaurant Cote de Plage which was excellent . good breakfast buffet and rooms overlooking pool which in our opinion were nicer than the sea view ones short walk to all amenities and although as English we were in the minority we had a wonderful holiday. Reception was very friendly and all staff were great. Recommend it to any one who wants a nice relaxing holiday .
 October 2009,5,Most comfortable beds ever!,"We stayed at the Sofitel for three days at the beginning of October, after spending 3 days in Marrakech. The contrast was amazing - after the heat, dust and chaos of Marrakech, Essaouira is a cooler, calmer, more relaxed place. The Sofitel is a large, clean, modern hotel, conveniently located across the corniche from the beach and a short walk from the medina. It has a large open-air pool a smaller indoor spa pool, and a private fully attended beach area with a mix of cabanas and sun beds. I don't agree with the reviewer who found the staff aloof - we found them to be very friendly, polite and attentive and were greeted eveywhere with smiles. We paid for a sea view and felt it was well worth it - the room wasn't noisy at all, despite what another reviewer reckoned, and the…"
 July 2009,5,Big can sometimes be beautiful,"My family and I stayed for 11 days at the Sofitel. We were looking for style, comfort and facilities - we got all three.. but we also got a bit more. I recommend this hotel most highly and I am unusually critical of hotels run by global chains. Perhaps its the French approach - staying in a large hotel run by a French/North African management rather than US management - perhaps its the Moroccan way; caring and genuine - the effect was excellent. We choose the Sofitel because it had a big pool and we had a small child (= happy kids); and in the heat of summer Morocco, this was wonderful. The whole poolside was lovely, swaying palms and very clean, laid back and expertly run by two dedicated pool attendants. Yes, you had to secure a deck chair by 10am to be sure of a place, but…"
 June 2009,5,Luxury International where you get what you expect,"We travelled to Essaouira by car as part of our Sovereign package holiday after 4 nights in a riad in Marrakech. We just wanted to relax by a pool in anonymous surroundings so the Sofitel was perfect for that. It's standard 4/5 star international fayre, excellent if impersonal service (mainly French spoken, some English) with maid service twice a day, fruit bowl and complimentary water and nice clean room/bathroom, with separate toilet which was good. We had room 240 overlooking medina and the sea, not noisy with the windows closed despite building site across the road but we didn't plan to spend long in the room. Pool was nice, large, right temperature and plenty sunbeds even though hotel was pretty full. Poolside service not brilliant, you had to seek out a waiter if you…"
 May 2008,5,"beautiful, we loved it",We enjoyed our stay here. We did the half board program and found the dinners to be excellent in all of the three restaurants.
 April 2009,3,Typical large hotel chain,"What you get here is consistent large hotel chain service. Sofitel is pretty good, and that's what you can expect here. The service is above average, but I think that's cultural and not because it's a Sofitel as service in other hotels in Morocco seems to be above average as well. Bed was big and comfortable, water was reliable, but along with big hotel pluses you can get big hotel minuses. We had an ant problem and the WC smelled like it was backing up - small problems that are easily overlooked when you have hundreds of rooms to manage. Finally, there's no reason to think you're in Morocco in this hotel, which is to be expected and not necessarily a problem if what you're looking for are western comforts and levels of professionalism - otherwise, stay in a Riad."
 November 2006,5,Brilliant Service,"We had a very memorable stay at the Sofitel in Essaouira, primarily because of the level of service we received. The receptionist noticed that it was my husband's birthday the day after we checked in, and arranged for a huge birthday cake to be sent to our dinner table in the evening. The staff were friendly and polite the whole time - even having to move rooms because of flooding on the balcony was impeccably handled. All in all, I'd highly recommend it. We decamped after a couple of nights to a riad in the medina, to get a more ""authentically"" Moroccan experience, but I'd definitely go back."
 October 2008,4,more 4* than 5*,"Stayed for 8 nights in mid October and overall impression was good. We didn't have to wait long to get into our rooms and when we did it was an excellent room in a fab location - room 203, whereby we had both a pool and a sea view but not paying the extra for the sea view or experiencing the road noise. Room was a good size, comfy bed and clean. Breakfast was adequate, didn't eat at the hotel in the evening so cant comment there. There were always plenty of sunbeds and the pool guys would always change your towel if you wanted a dry one, but as the pool was bloody freezing going into it to cool down was a hard decision. The free hammam down stairs was fab and never busy, we used to go around 4pm when it started to cool down outside. A nice 10 minute walk brought you into…"
 October 2008,4,Sofitel - fine but nothing special,"The Sofitel is a good option if you are going to Essaouira. It is situated on the beach just outside the Medina so provides a convenient location. Pool is nice as are the other gym / spa facilities. The only thing that the Sofitel lacks is that little bit of character to remind you that you're in Morocco - the rooms are nice, clean, large and well appointed - this is exactly my point. Overall the Sofitel was what we needed for a few days of relaxation and would recommend for those who've spent some time in the cities and want to unwind."
 September 2008,3,Mixed Bag,"We booked into the Sofitel for 5 nights on a half board basis. Our first impression of the hotel is that it is beautifully located opposite the lovely sandy beach and promenade separated by the road. The building itself is a two storey pinky coloured concrete structure and is not the most attractive. You enter up steps into a large reception area done out in marble with the obligatory sofas, tea urns and small fountain surrounded by flowers. Our arrival was efficiently carried out and we were welcomed with a glass of mint tea and cool flannel. We booked into their standard room which is called superior so we were inside overlooking the central area containing the patio and swimming pool. We were pleased about this as we had heard that the more classier beach view rooms…"
 August 2008,4,Nice new hotel in Essaouira,"We just came back from Essaouira where we spent 2 nights at the Sofitel Essaouira. The hotel location is very convenient right on the beach and not far from the medina. The rooms are very big and very new. The hotel pool is nice and the staff is very professional. The hotel is not very attractive, it's a Sofitel, nothing special but it's fine and very convenient for a short stay."
 August 2008,2,Up Themselves,"The hotel is well situated and the rooms are well appointed with very comfortable beds. I can understand reports of the hotel as soulless - I thought it had a stiff, unwelcoming feel. A couple I sat next to on the plane back to England had been given gift boxes to compensate for what they thought was the unfriendly character of their stay. I asked what their problem had been and they cited regular requests for their room number to prove that they were guests. We had noise from above late at night but in fairness the reception tackled the problem promptly by phoning the room. My problem was that through a mistake in the booking we were thrown out a day early. I accept that the problem came from a mistake on my part but the nature of our ejection left a bad taste - my 14 year old…"
 March 2008,3,Mixed,"We spent two nights here in March '08. Having spent a memorable few days in other Riads/boutique hotels in Marrakech & Essaouira, the Sofitel seemed very clinical and soulless in comparison. The hotel itself is very nice with a great swimming pool, loungers and hammocks. The hotel room was fairly standard and was clean and well kept. We ate lunch in one of the restaurants the day we arrived but it was very poor quality and overpriced so we didn't eat in the hotel again. I found the hotel staff quite unfriendly and unhospitable and felt like the hotel was continuously trying to elicit more money, whether it was for internet cards, taxis, drinks etc. I tried to book a treatment in the Thalasso centre but the staff their were downright rude. While I couldn't really fault the hotel…"
 June 2008,4,Very nice hotel; pity about the service,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. The hotel is very nice (as you'd expect from a Sofitel) and very well located, just 200 metres away from the medina. The rooms are very good, with air conditioning and a flat-screen tv. The pool is particularly enjoyable, with very good service and very relaxing (bear in mind that unless you're into surfing the beach is not really an option: the water is freezing and it's very windy). On the negative side, the service at the hotel is quite poor. Food is extremely over-priced and not very good. The spa is ok, but unless you've booked a whole treatment service is not particularly good. My girlfriend and I booked separate massages and when she showed up at my appointment they initially refused to see her. Ridiculous... Overall, if you get a…"
 May 2008,5,Best hotel in Morocco!,"We stayed here for our first night in Essaouira and adored it! The room was huge with a huge balcony overlooking the pool area so it was very quiet at night - and even during the day, it is well soundproofed. Check in was wonderfully smooth, fresh fruit, nuts and dates in the room with fluffy bathrobes and slippers provided. The Cote Plage across the road on the beach which is part of the hotel serves wonderful food with a great view and not too pricey. The pool is lovely - at a constant temperature of 24 degrees, it was never too cold to take a dip. They organised a squad bike afternoon and allowed us to use the pool and facilities even after we had checked out. The breakfast was fabulous - continental, cooked, fresh fruit, maroccan - and plenty of it and you had the choice of…"
 April 2008,4,Nice hotel,Loved this hotel and Essaouira. We booked an ocean view room which was definitely worth the extra money. The rooms were a good size and very clean. The bed was also comfortable. There was a bowl of fruit and fresh water in the room every day. You can walk around in the fluffy robe they provide to go to the swimming pool or for treatments so it felt a bit like a health spa. The hotel was only a short walk to the town. We hired bikes from the hotel and the man who organised them for us could not have been nicer. We did not have the breakfast at the hotel as it seemed overpriced and you can eat very cheaply in the town.
 April 2008,5,Does what it says on the tin,"No question that this is a good 5* hotel, offering the facilities and location exactly as it describes, as well as several personal touches such as a complimentary bowl of fruit in the room which was topped up every day.The rooms are spacious, beautifully fitted out, with comfortable beds and excellent bathrooms, as well as high speed WiFi connection. The public areas are also nicely designed and well maintained, but the most impressive feature must be the swimming pool. Not only is it a good size, heated and immaculately maintained, but it is well sheltered from the winds which often batter Essaouira - I am well used to making the best of fickle Scottish beach weather, but it was impossible to even walk near the sea front on 3 of the 5 days I spent in Essaouira, despite warm…"
 March 2008,5,"Fantastic Hotel, top service","We booked a ocean view room in sofitel, for 4 days and i cant say enough how fantastic this hotel is. The entrance and lounge are very welcoming and as we checked in they offer us refreshing wet towel, drinks and biscuits. Our room was nice, clean and specious as well and the view was breath taking. The room had all the facilities a 5 star hotel should have. The breakfast offered a good variety of food like crepes, omelet, sausages, croissant, yogurt, cakes etc. We dined once in the main restaurant of the hotel and loved the food. During our stay the manager of the hotel invited all the guests to a cocktail party in which they chit chat with every1 about what we liked in their hotel and in their city and what can they do to improve, we thought that was very considerit of them.…"
 February 2008,4,Great location and personal service for this size of hotel,"Had an ocean view ""superior"" room - very clean, well equipped and with fantastic views. Staff (generally) very friendly and polite. Restaurants very good, particularly the Moroccan restaurant past the reception. Pool area was nice and peaceful. The only negative point was that my partner got caught by the lift door closing very abruptly (the sensors that should've reversed the door closing would appear to be very insensitive as the doors kept on closing). She damaged a bracelet in the process and the reception staff were quite indifferent to the incident or the implication if that had been a child caught by the doors. That aside, a nice hotel, perfect location and pleasant surroundings."
 December 2007,4,"Great Location, Great Hotel","The Hotel is located across the road from the sandy beach, and a pleasant 5-10 minutes walk from the Port and Medina. The lobby area was nicely decorated to reflect the Christmas season, and the check in staff were professional and courteous. Our room was clean and nicely presented with complimentary basket of fruit, free bottled water (replaced daily), chocolates, and rose petals sprinkled on the bed. We had a balcony with good view of the pool. The pool itself is surrounded on all four sides be the hotel, which meant the West side is most of the day in shadow. However, the is a nice elevated solarium area at the North end, which offer good day long sun, and is also nicely sheltered from any prevailing breeze. The gym was reasonable, and I seriously recommend the Hammam…"
 November 2007,5,Great place to stay,"Stayed for 6 nights from 10 - 16 November, for our wedding anniversary. Arrived from Marrakech by taxi due to flight times. Supratours run a service at 65 dirhams ( just over £4 per ticket) plus 10 dirhams per piece of luggage - we used this on the way back - very good. We were met in the hotel with a mint tea and some moroccan biscuits, most welcome. Check in took about 10 minutes and went very smoothly. Our room was great - huge bed, large bath, all very comfortable. If you are booking this hotel - you are charged more for a sea view - these rooms face onto the road, so if you are sitting on the balcony, you can be seen by passers by. We didn't pay extra for this and I'm glad we didn't. Breakfast - fantastic! After 6 days we still hadn't managed to try all on offer.…"
 November 2007,4,We loved the comfort and luxery,We wanted to spolit ourselves and get out of the maddness that was Marrakech. We were after a comfortable and relaxing place to stay that had a pool. We got everything we were after. The pool was beautiful and the beds were comfy. In terms of service it was not the usual '5 star the customer is always right' type of service but they were friendly enough. They even sent up a free bottle of wine when our toilet kept playing up. Best part was we got a really good rate - far cheaper then their advertised rack rates. The rate also included their excellent breakfast and not to mention free access to the hamama.
 October 2007,5,top dollar,"Great Hotel. Food superb, if a bit fancy. Breakfast was stonkingly good. Staff wonderful and rooms very clean. An excellent place for a week of fun. Advice would be to fly from Paris direct to Essaouira and avoid to trip from Marrakech (an overhyped place if ever there was one!) The road a potential death trap, in my opinion. Go Quad biking with 'Cap Quad', a local set up that the hotel arranged for my family. Haven't had so much fun with my clothes on in ages! about £36.00 each for five hours. Should have done a full day with lunch included. Special mention to Addul the beach chap who kept my son & I entertained with various games etc. Please try and speak french and learn a few local phrases, well worth it. 'I'll be back'"
 October 2007,4,A comfortable hotel,Spent a week here. Excellent location on the beach and just outside the medina. Excellent facilities with good breakfasts. All very comfortable. Meals are expensive (we didn't try them). Essaouira has many good places to eat at a fraction of the cost. Most guests were French. Not much atmosphere.
