 September 2022,5,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for a couple of days. The staff was welcoming, nice, professional, and helpful. The room has a pool view, which was very nice. The room was very clean with a nice bed and balcony. In the Pitch Cafe, Nabil Saffahy was amazing, with good customer service with a smile. Badr in the other restaurant was super nice and helpful too. I recommend Fes Marriott",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2022,4,Great Hotel with Only One Problem,"Beautiful hotel and big rooms, but the air conditioning was turned off so the rooms were too hot for sleeping well.

They also arranged a ride for us from Fes to Marrakech, as well as rides to restaurants.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2023,5,Great hotel in a beautiful old world city that has the new and old beautifully balanced,"The property is large and very well kept. The room was also very spacious and clean and well maintained. The bathroom was large and clean. Best part the only hotel out of all we stayed at in morocco that had a health faucet! Breakfast buffet was very elaborate and staff every where was very courteous. Dinner in the traditional Moroccan restaurant was excellent, both food and ambience with live music. All in all faultless… Suggestions- a weighing scale in the room.

 December 2022,2,Worst Marriott Ever,"Reserved a 3 person’s bedroom. Couch bed was unbearable and they didn’t have any alternative for us. I had to book an extra room only to know the next day they did have rollerbeds. Barely any hot water in the shower. A/C not working and they won’t call you a taxi unless it’s a big service car. Front desk said they were “sorry” but they clearly couldn’t care less. With so many other great options in town, I clearly wouldn’t recommend anyone staying here.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2022,2,Don't expect 4 or 5 star service,"Good: The in house Moroccan restaurant is quite good, with a reasonably large choice of local food. The bell captains are prompt and friendly as are the hostesses in the breakfast restaurant. Bad: The rest of the staff in the breakfast restaurant is simply unfriendly and the service there is quite bad. The odds of getting your eggs made right are quite low, and some staff acted like they were being bothered by the guests. Only once in four days did the staff clear the empty plates during breakfast. Ugly: The heater in our room wouldn't turn off, so one of our rooms was quite hot for 2 days. When I reported it, the first person at the front desk told me to open my windows. Eventually common sense prevailed, and they sent maintenance to the room. The solution was a…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2022,5,Awesome Value. Super Nice Hotel. Great Staff.,"Wow. We had the pleasure of being in Fes when Morocco advanced in The Cup. What a wild and awesome party throughout The City! The hotel is beautiful, in a great location, and the staff bent over backwards for us. It’s modern, accommodating, and nicer than places we usually stay. Najim was super helpful and made us feel so welcome. Mohammed and Imad helped us with directions to the Medina (decent walk, or short cab). We usually rough it, but splurged on this hotel which is a great value for the cost. I usually talk up staff that are great, but these folks truly were some of the most helpful and friendly group I’ve ever experienced. And yeah guys… you can have a beer or two at the bar!",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 November 2022,5,Excellence in Fes!,"My wife and I stayed at the Fes Marriott for 3-nights. We had such a wonderful time. It started with a surprise upgrade to our room. The room we were assigned had a nice living room and a separate Bedroom arrangement. The front desk staff (Mohammad, Manal) and the Concierge (Imad, Najid) - were so welcoming, courteous and supportive. Mohammad helped us understand the places we could drive by ourselves (we had a car), where to park, how much to pay the attendant. They also helped us get reservations to a wonderful restaurant inside the Medina that we had on our list (Restaurant Dar Hatim). The next day we tried the breakfast. It has a nice spread of Moroccan and Continental dishes.

The bathroom is spacious too. Has provision for making coffee/tea in the room. Breakfast buffet has reasonable choice , though they didn't put out the cold cuts for the group tours. After covid, seems like most hotels even in the 4 to 5 star category don't put room slippers out unless you ask for them.

Excellent, clean, comfortable, very spacious accommodations and just perfect for our group. Where this hotel really shines is their dining room staff. Our folks were treated like royalty. The staff was very helpful and accommodating at the breakfast buffet and really went out of their way to serve special diets and help those who needed assistance. We also had a special private celebration dinner and the staff was just wonderful!! They waited on our group, helped serve a special cake and made all sorts of arrangements so that everyone felt special. No special request was overlooked. Extreme attention to detail!

 October 2022,3,Looks nice at the surface...but behind...there are a couple of weaknesses.,"The hotel looks nice and great ... at the surface. The details behind are the same as at my previous stays, like two years ago. There was only cold water for the shower. It was not fixed during my 5 nights stay, even I raised it each morning at the desk. At the last day the central power switch was broken..no light. The server in the bar forgot our orders. For me ... OK if you stay for one or two nights. For a private stay I would select another one.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,5,Beautiful Hotel and great staff!,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. The décor in the hotel was first class and elegant. The reception staff were polite and efficient. Our room was very spacious, spotless and had all the amenities needed. The bed was very comfortable but unfortunately the pillows were not as good - they went very flat during the night. There were a couple of other negatives. Firstly, the bathroom light could not be switched on without the very bright corridor light (I don't know if this was limited to our room). This meant that during the night we could only go to the bathroom in the pitch black or wake up the other person by putting the light on. The curtain tracks which relied on pull cords were broken so it was very difficult to open and close the curtains. We ate in the Moroccan…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,2,Nice from the outside but old rooms,"We had 2 rooms at the Fes Marriott hotel, the hotel has a nice Moroccan style and architecture but the rooms were not in a good shape and need some maintenance. The water in the bath was not going through and after raising the issues to the reception they proposed a similarly bad room. I would not recommend this hotel",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,4,"Convenient, Quiet Location",The two best things about the Marriott are the staff such as Mr. Chalik and Mr. Mohammad in the Moroccan Restaurant or Mr. Rachid on the front door. We found all the staff going out of their way to make our stay comfortable. The food in the Moroccan restaurant was very good and we kept going back. The property is a little worn but put that aside and you will truly enjoy your stay.,Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,4,Nice convenient Hotel,"This hotel is located outside the Medina. A taxi can get you there in no time to the Medina for 20 dirhams. They only thing is the hotel doesn’t call for taxis you have to walk out on the road to hail one down. It’s wasn’t a big issue for us. It’s a fairly large hotel. It caters to a lot of tour busses. Having said that it’s still big enough that it really doesn’t change any ones stay as most people check in at night and leave the next morning. They have a beautiful large pool and a large fitness club. The rooms were clean, large, water pressure was good, staff at reception were very welcoming. The hotel arranged a tour guide for us to walk thru the Medina and we paid the guide directly for it. The Moroccan restaurant has good food. The pub does too but the service in there was…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2022,3,Disappointed,"Disappointed by the room and maintenance. Not a 5* service either. It’s a crowded hotel and there are so many rooms, you can’t expect a personalized service there. When we arrived at the hotel we had to carry our luggages to the main entry until someone from the staff started helping us. The shower pressure was very low. The air condition was working hard when we arrived in the room, it was very cold and therefore I started to cough the day after… the pool area is ok and you can get a towel there. However the breakfast was also below expectation with not fresh croissant and terrible coffee machine. The only positive thing is the price we paid. Finally we felt like in a 4 stars instead of a 5. I’d rather spend the double the amount and get a way better experience next time.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Clean. High quality. Nicely staffed. We wish we had this gym back home! The spa was good with a nice massage. The food. OMG the food! Let's start with the breakfast.

The rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms. The pool area is gorgeous. The breakfast offers more ""western"" options than other hotels I stayed at but they also have Moroccan specialities and endless amounts of cakes and sweet treats as served for breakfast.

 June 2022,2,Disappointed,"Very mixed feelings on this place. We stayed for two nights. I used a suite night award to upgrade to the executive suite. It was confirmed via email about 6 days before our arrival. But the day of our scheduled arrival, I checked the Marriott app and noticed they had allocated us to a downgraded family suite instead (which is advertised at about half the rate). I tried using the chat feature to remedy the issue but wasn’t getting anywhere with them, so I had to call a couple of times to be able to speak with guest services to get it sorted out. Seems they didn’t take note of the confirmed suite night upgrade, which could have been a bigger issue if they didn’t have that room type available for us on arrival. Aside from that, the concierge is used by the hotel as a revenue…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The hotel is sparkly clean and absolutely gorgeous, the food is fresh, the service is simply exceptional from the entrance to the front desk, to the chambermaids, to the restaurant staff and to the pool staff.

Breakfast with a mix or Moroccan and Occidental offerings. However, reason why I picked this one and not a riad in the Medina was to get a proper night of sleep. And in that, what can be called the primary function of an hotel, it failed. The room was just too hot (measured 27 degrees when I woke up). Seems that the air conditioning can't be made to output cold. All the building gets cold or hot. That is it. Apart from that, there was also an issue with the amount of taxes on the reservation not matching the amount charged on check-in, by a factor of 10.

I also enjoyed a revitalizing and relaxing bubble bath the night of my stay, before sleeping soundly in my air conditioned room and my king size bed! The stay was then perfected by the pleasant and kind staff (characteristic of Moroccan hospitality).

The room is average size but nicely appointed, and has a great little balcony. Bed was comfortable. Staff were always friendly and offering to help. Location is not ideal but fine, taxis are very cheap, and it’s interesting to contrast the new city with the old. Tip: the Lebanese restaurant on site is extraordinary, and reasonably priced. Beautiful atmosphere and live music. Best in-hotel restaurant I’ve visited in a while, too. The others in the hotel (Italian and bar) are nothing to write home about.

But the room itself is a little bit old, no slipper for guest (you need to ask for it if you need one) which is really unprofessional for the hotel at this price. The thing that really tick me off is about the breakfast, the line for fresh cook egg is really long. If you just need a scramble egg, you have to wait at least 10 minute which is ridiculous. If you need some thing quick, just take the boil egg instead, or come back another time later when the group of tourism has gone.

 March 2019,5,Grand hotel,"The Fez Marriott is an impressively decorated hotel. The room was very clean, spacious and well-appointed with a nice balcony area. The king-size bed and clean and comfortable bedding afforded a restful sleep. Wifi and a small bottle of water were complimentary. The buffet breakfast comprised a nice array and variety of food supplemented by the availability of an egg chef. The one concern is that there are a number of small, individually inconsequential defects requiring attention — a loose tap here; a missing knob there — which if ignored will accumulate and eventually detract significantly from the magnificent rooms. The staff were immaculate in their uniforms and costumes. They were particularly friendly and helpful. In sum, a fabulous stylish place to stay.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

When we entered the room the TV gave off an annoying high pitched whine, and we were unable to turn it off. It appeared to us that the batteries in the remote were not working. The in-room safe was not working either, the person at Reception said that it was due to low batteries, and offered only that I could use the safe at reception, which was obviously inconvenient. In addition, the hotel’s system is on “heat”, with the result that the room is uncomfortably warm. Someone from the Front Desk staff came to the room.

The staff could not do enough to assist me on arrival and for the rest of my visit. The pool looked enticing, it is huge, but sadly it is not heated and the weather was not so good.

After fast check-in we hurried to the restaurant where we were greeted by a friendly girl. Food and service were both impecable. It took us a lot more than 20 minutes to finish out dinner and even though my husband and I were the only visitors left, no one seemed to be in a hurry to close the restaurant. Even the live band kept playing only for us. The room was just as it looks like in the pictures. Comfortable bed, quite room, clean bathroom, cosy balcony overlooking a nice garden.

The only improvements were possibly the need for a few touch ups and renovations along with a possible lounge or evening benefit. Booking: As a SPG/Marriott Platinum Premier member, we used the SPG application to book. No issue booking.

They put us all near each other as promised and every one of us had a large room with a balcony. The staff couldn't have been nicer. They were helpful in setting up day trips and making dinner reservations outside of the hotel. Not that you needed to leave the hotel to eat though. There are three dining choices on site and the middle eastern one is not to be missed. It is beautifully decorated and has live music that can't be beat. We went in the winter so we could only gaze longingly at the fabulous pool area. The health club was the best I have seen in a hotel.,Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Boutimia arranges a surprised cake that was delivered to our room. I am platinum member and had reserved two room for the family. We were presented with fresh fruit baskets upon arrival and nice welcome smile which makes a huge difference. Will defiantly stay at this place if we go back to Morocco.

I have tried all sorts of email addresses and phone number, and for main marriot numbers! and nothing. this has really caused myself and partner a lot of unnecessary stress after a relaxing holiday as we need out £252.52 released payment!! we settled all the room prior to our visit and paid the total bar and food in cash before leaving the hotel!

 August 2018,4,Great hotel,The hotel has great facilities as you would expect in any other 4* hotel. Pool was great especially in the heat. Not overcrowded which was great. Breakfast if opting for the buffet looked slightly disappointing as not as much options as you would expect for a 4* however a la carte breakfast menu was fine. Phowever we mostly went to the local cafes which were approximately 5 mins walking distance and prices were much cheaper for a more substantial amount of food. Food at the poolside bar was good also. The shisha bar was a bonus addition but it could stay open slightly longer than 12am. The hotel itself is quite far from the old down. You would need a taxi to get there.,Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

We were very pleased the staff welcomed us kindly (as we both looked a bit weary; arriving with just our backpacks.) I stay at various Marriott hotels in USA and was amazed at this particular hotel. My daughter was curious about the hotel and was walking in it, looking at the various accommodations, and the general manager saw her and gave her a private tour which was not expected.

My wallet contained around 200 Euros (combined euros/dollars and dirhams). I asked for the lost and found, I had to spend one hour at the reception before the manager showed up and said she didn’t find anything. After I insisted, she came back 15 minutes later with my wallet, with no money in it. I am glad I didn’t lose my ID, but I am DISAPPOINTED that they could take my money, just like that!

 July 2018,5,"Relaxing Hotel, Good Value","My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in early July. While most people seem to want to be in the medina, we wanted the ability to retreat to peace and quiet. We made the right choice, as the hotel's excellent pool and fitness center provided the perfect way to pass the hot afternoons. Taxis are plentiful and will not cost more than 15 dirham ($1.66 as of 07.14.2018) to get to the medina, so we did not feel like we lost anything not being at the medina. And even though Nouvelle Fez (not to be confused with New Fez, that's different) is a bit boring, it was nice to see a different side of Fez.

Easy to park the car. Did not have breakfast at the hotel because there are so many nice places within walking distance. Once outside the hotel grounds you are in the real Morocco so prepare for that (not a very clean part of town but the hotel can't help this).

Which is a shame, as with a bit of customer service training for the staff and attention to detail it could be a fantastic hotel. The only reason we picked this hotel over the many other was the pool, so we could come back from a days sightseeing and let the kids play and cool off in the pool.

Secondly, when we arrived in the hotel after touring Volubilis around 3:30 in the afternoon, we were very very hungry, asking the Concierge to recommend a restaurant. Youssef, the guy works at the Concierge desk, said there’s a nearby Moroccan restaurant would send a car to pick us up in 2 minutes. We waited 20 minutes, no car showed up.

 April 2018,2,Nice facade but lacking,"We are still staying at this hotel. The building, grounds and rooms are beautiful but overall the details in this hotel are lacking. We booked this hotel because of the pool but the pool is empty and under renovation. This was not advertised by the hotel prior to our arrival (The Marriott website said the pool would be finished in February). The air conditioning is broken, which for my unwell fiance is making the stay very difficult. We complained and the person we sent just showed me how to use the controls and said it is working. It is like a furnace in the rooms. Finally, the bathroom on arrival was not fully stocked with towels or toilet paper. In short, the hotel looks beautiful, but the little details which make for a special stay are not there.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The hotel is nice and in a good location but what separates it from other hotels not just in the area but in the country is it’s great staff. From front desk Tj the resturant staff to the shopkeeper, Hishaam; Fes Marriott simply has the best staff. The highlight of our stay at this hotel was evening dinners at the Moroccon resturant inside the hotel. The staff (Hassan, Nebel, Salma, and Sukaina) were just incredible. My daughter was a little sick the first day and threw up inside the restaurant. The manager, Hassan, did everything he could to make the experience pleasant.

Obviously, it was a very different experience from a Riad but a truly wonderful one. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms warm and comfortable, the showers hot and the amenities plentiful. The staff, however, stands out for their professionalism and welcoming attitude. In particular, Rachid, couldn't have been more helpful and friendly in arranging taxis and, in fact, walking me out to the street, waving one down for me and ensuring that the driver knew my destination.

My husband and I stayed here and had our credit card swiped but then our deposit was never returned. I've since called them twice (both times I was assured that there was a delay with my bank (I've never, ever encountered this problem getting a credit back on my card).

Posh locality (which is both good and bad depending on what you look for). The Bad - Long check-in due to some miscommunication between the staff.

 December 2017,3,Need to train the staff,I travel a lot (internationally and within the USA) and stay at Marriotts most of the time. This was probably the worst experience at a Marriott. The problems started from the time of check-in. 1. They took close to 35 minutes to check us in. There were at least 3 front desk people and no more than 3-4 customers checking in at that time. Granted they had to take passport details from the customers. But it seemed like the front desk people were just slow. 2. The hotel’s ac system was switched to heat only but that left the rooms extremely warm. The only option is to keep the patio door open. 3. The front desk/support people are unresponsive or just don’t care. We asked for towels - we had booked room for four people but there were only two towels. The towels didn’t show up at…,Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

It’s also the worst Marriott we’ve ever stayed at. To begin with, the rooms are uncomfortably hot. The heat is blasting, with no way to turn it off. There is no a/c, as it’s been turned off for the winter. We’ve been told our only option is to leave the sliding door to the balcony open. Hotel staff is poorly trained. We’ve had to ask for tissues, toilet paper, water, and towels. The rooms are poorly laid out, with chairs blocking space between the desk and beds. Definitely not designed with women’s needs in mind...Not enough hangers, no luggage racks, sparse drawer space.

I like Mariott hotel and for the nature of my work i stayed in this hotel in different countries, but this one In Fes is such a disappointment!!

It evokes images of the mysterious and beautiful with names of its cities such as Fes, Casablanca or Marrakech. I flew to Fes and decided upon the Marriott. When I arrived, I was informed that there was no shuttle service to the hotel. As the hotel recently has come under the umbrella of the Marriott group, I would expect this to be rectified at some point in the future. It would certainly add to the whole experience.

The staff does try very hard to accommodate guest as best as possible , but it seems they are missing some managerial direction. The food was good . A slight inconvenience was that they do not currently carry a liquor license. My family and I are not drinkers but I think it is still important to tell guest upon check in. I would go back , and have great hope that upon my return they will work on those details.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2017,1,Very bad experience,"This is the first time, as a Silver Elite member of Marriott, that I write a negative post about one of their hotels. This was really an awful experience for me and my family. We had 3 rooms reserved, two were upgraded to suites, one was charged for the upgrade and one was not. The suite I was in, had very poor A/C, not towels in one of the bathrooms, and poor lighting throughout the room. I requested to change rooms, they put me in another suite, that had better A/C but the lights were not working. Certain lights could not be turned off. The technician came to my room at midnight to disconnect all the electricity, and reconfigure the electrical switches. I went to the front desk to complain about the conditions of the room and saw two members of the front desk…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2017,5,The best in Fes .,We have stayed a couples of nights at the marriott Fes. Brand new hotel .furniture is new . Clean room . Swiming pool is amazing . The highlight of this hotel is the food is outstanding . We ate at the Italian restaurant and the Moroccan on the second night we were very happy with our choices. The only issue that the AC was not working at the Moroccan restaurant and we are not confortable eating with the heat. Other than that everything is good.,Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2017,4,They are trying....,"We have stayed at this Marriott three times. Each time the service is a little better, but still lacking from other Marriott properties in some areas. We are very disappointed on this most recent visit that it appears they have lost their liquor license and are no longer serving alcohol at all. Since our last stay was about 1 month ago, this happened very recently and impacts our experience. The rooms and hotel are beautiful, all the food has been good especially the Italian restaurant, the gym is truly Excellent will all new equipment, and the pool is a very nice place to relax. In three visits, We have not had an experience of loud inappropriate music at the pool as a couple recent reviewers mentioned, so I think maybe that was an isolated event. This place could…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 August 2017,1,Loud music at pool is awful and inappropriate,"Hotel is great for families and is clean and functional. My only issue really is that they play loud, awful commercial house music at the pool at top volume all day, as if it's Ibiza or something. It's completely inappropriate as 100% of the clientele are families and couples who are visually annoyed by the music. We asked to turn it down 3 or 4 times and each time the staff were inundated by other clients with complaints. Many of the songs the DJ was playing had explicit language with children listening (I can only imagine that they don't understand English and the content). There's a few other details like it takes hours (literally) to get served at the pool (and the music is so loud they can't even hear the order). Not a place to chill out but it really should be. That's…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2017,4,Lovely rooms,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a tour we were told it was brand new - it clearly wasn't but it was pleasant enough. The rooms were quite large, the bed super comfy and luxurious as were the pillows. It was nice and clean and felt well cared for. The WiFi was strong and the lovely deck off our room was excellent. The pool was also great at the end of a long day. We both thought the breakfast buffet was ok and my husband enjoyed the buffet dinner which I didn't. The only issue with this hotel is that it advertises that it has a bar etc which it foes but no liquor license so there was NO alcohol at all at this hotel and no where anywhere close to purchase it which is completely unacceptable. To be honest I dont think they should have opened until they had their license or…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2017,4,"Clean, good amenities and not Riad!","This was our first visit to Fes. We came from Marakesh by the train which was an uncomfortable journey. We stayed in Riad in Marakesh so we wanted a normal hotel. Marriott ticked the boxes for a modern hotel. Enough toiletries, tea and coffee making facilities and low noise AC. The staff are friendly.The concierge recommended our driver which was excellent so we booked him for 3 days. His name was Idris. Meanwhile, the guide they recommend to take me around old medina by foot wasn't as good. His name was Rachid. Hotel staff were friendly and respond to any request willingly. They even sent me fresh mint when I requested it. The breakfast and pool were both good. The pastry in the breakfast was very fresh and tasty. All in all we had a comfortable stay. The only con: It is away…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2017,4,Facade,"First impressions are that of a luxury hotel- the rooms look lovely... spacious,inviting, beautifully decorated. They have delightful balconies and are well appointed. The pool is large . The breakfast is good and most of the staff are wonderful. There was one lady in a grey suit in the restaurant that was clearly having a bad day or she simply looks and acts miserable all of the time. The hotel doesn't have a liquor license even though you are given the impression it does. There are definitely cracks in the facade of first impressions. Overall it's very good.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 July 2017,2,looks beautiful but service poor,"we have just returned from a week at this hotel and while it looks beautiful and on the surface the staff appear to be very warm and welcoming we left feeling disappointed on many levels. Although half board, we were basically rationed for our dinner, being told there was a strict price quota of 250MAD for adults and 125 for children. This despite the fact that we had paid for 3 adults because my daughters were 11 and 15 respectively. No wine was included and they charged nearly £7 for a half glass! To add insult to injury they tried to charge us for all our dinners at the end of the week because we had supposedly eaten a la carte, when there was only one menu on offer! And they claimed we had only paid for 2 people and so tried to charge us for the 3rd person (the three of us…",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2017,5,Amazing hotel.,I stayed here for an night to attend a friend's wedding. This is a well maintained and sprawling property. The lobby is just beautiful and so was the event hall. All rooms have a patio. We felt the air conditioning was a little weak in our room given that it was 46 degrees outside. But we managed as it was just for a night. The bed was super comfortable and helped alleviate the discomfort. Would visit again in a different room !,Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2017,4,"Beautiful suite upgrade, wish they spoke english","We had a 'Lost in Translation' moment from the time we entered this beautiful hotel. We missed our chance for a swim because someone told us they close at 7, then someone else at 5 and then finally at 6. Trying to find something to eat around 4 was ridiculous because nothing looked like it was open. Place looked like a ghost town. The room however was beautiful, for the points that it took to book this marriott I probably couldnt even get a fairfield inn in the US and they gave us a beautiful suite with two balconies completely updated. I would go back here in a heart beat, hopefully by then they will have improved the language skills of the staff. Surprisingly everyone in the town spoke better english than this hotel staff. Go figure.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

My friend and I feel welcomed by the guest relation manager Dounia and she is very helpful with friendly attitude to help us on transportation in Fes. The staff Hichim(sorry I hope I have not remembered the name wrongly) is also very kind and cheerful to us. Yet, I would say the maintainance has to be improved. I found the air-conditioner did not work at all when I arrived, it was kind of unbearable to wait at the room with over 4o degree to fix it. But Dounia has tried her best to re-arrange the room for us. Breakfast offers a great variety to choose even in Ramadan. We feel joyful to have breakfast there.

Well located in the new town but an easy and cheap Petit Taxi ride to the old city and medina (walkable but not in 42degree heat!) Recently taken over by Marriott but still retaining a lot of the old staff. Easy check in and large well appointed room (325); spotlessly clean and with upmarket toiletries, large fluffy towels and free water and coffee machine. Lovely grounds and large warm clean and mainly deserted swimming pool. I was on half board with two restaurants available one italian and one moroccan.

We stayed in a two level family room/suite, allowing our girls to stay on one level and us on the other, giving us all a little privacy. The girl's pull out bed and some problems the first night which left the girls sleeping at an angle come morning (which was actually funny!)

Would benefit from staff training to improve their English to serve a wider cohort of travellers. The receptionist sounded slightly rude and blunt and I put it down to her lack of English. the guest enquires officer although super friendly still had very limited English which is hardly sufficient to do their job properly. For a high end hotel I'd expected slightly better service in that sense.",Fes_Marriott_Hotel_Jnan_Palace-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Having traveled to a lot of hotels and having spent time in Morocco, I knew there wouldn't be one in the room. I asked to please send one up ASAP and he told me that I had to check for one in the room first and if there wasn't one to call down. Well low and behold, no toothbrush in the room.
