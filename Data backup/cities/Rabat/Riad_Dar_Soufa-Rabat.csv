 November 2021,5,"Great place, great location, amazing architecture, super breakfast","We tremendously enjoyed our 4 day stay at the Riad. Latifa was an amazing host and everything was delightful. The internal architecture and artifacts, the cleanliness, the superb breakfast, the comfortable and spacious rooms and the quietness. It was un ideal place to come back to at the end of the day. Highly recommended!!"
 May 2021,5,Amazing architecture!,Excellent location. The Riad looks so moorish with a courtyard with a fountains and walls of beautiful moorish mosaics. The room was also beautiful. The service was excellent. I recommend this place if you are looking for the Real Morocco experience.
 January 2020,2,Not as good as other riads we stayed in,"Good location and a mix of modern and traditional Riad. However the water runs cold in the middle of the shower, and that repeated, so maybe their boiler is not enough to receive many guests. The beds are very comfortable and rooms are spacious, but unfortunately we can't ignore the cold shower during winter, specially after a few days in the desert (where we didn't expect hot water, but was very good). We also hated the small curtains. As the room in in the first floor, you can see the room from the patio."
 December 2019,5,Wonderful Experience!,"I had a wonderful experience. In the breakfast they served fruits and vegetables, yogurts and milk, croissants and pastries, pineapple, chocolate cake and much more. Our room had a different but awesome bath-tub and the staff was very helpful."
 December 2019,4,Good riad in Rabat,"This is a nice, good and clean riad in Rabat. Our host for the night was Abdur, who was very helpful and welcoming. The room was fine, but just a note, our room only had a curtain between the room and the small bathroom, so you could hear and potentially smell what’s going on in the bathroom. Location is close to restaurants and the Kasbah Oudaiya. Breakfast was very pleasant with fresh fruits, juice and coffee. Would stay again."
 November 2019,5,Great riad in convenient location,"We really enjoyed our stay in this riad, the room was lovely and spacious and very quiet. It is a very convenient location to go around the Medina and it is just a short walk from the main attractions (Kasbah des Oudaya, Hassan tower). The breakfast was great with plenty to eat and a very good selection of fruits, nuts and delicious homemade breads and pastries. The host gave us great recommendations for restaurants nearby that were very good value for money. Also the overall decor of the riad was beautiful. I would definitly recommend this riad for a city break in Rabat !"
 November 2019,5,Spacious riad with great service,"This is the biggest room that we stay in riad in Morocco, and it is nicely designed and well-equipped. It is tidy and comfortable. Staff are helpful and friendly, and they gave a good introduction of Rabat to us, which enhanced our travel experience in Rabat."
 October 2019,5,Two excellent nights in Rabat before touring the country,"Beautifully restored Riad in the Medina, large rooms, very attentive and helpful staff. As many Riads, we visited in Morocco, not enough light in the bedroom and bathroom. Wonderful rooftop terrace, Very clean. Classy"
 July 2019,5,Nice Riad,I forget the names of the staff. I was received by a lady who gave me a map and a great introduction to the city. She was helpful in many other ways. The young guy in the evening and night shift was great and very accommodating. This Riad is clean and great to stay at. Their breakfast is the best I ever had at any Rida during my stay in Morocco. The breakfast is fresh with lots of fruits and a huge amount of food. Has a wonderful rooftop. It would add to the beauty of the Riad if they put fine touches to the reception area. But to sum it up it is a wonderful place to stay at.
 May 2019,5,Best breakfast we had in Morocco,"We spent a night here. The riad is quiet, nicely decorated and conveniently located within the medina but close to the train station and the shore. Of all the places we stayed at in Morocco, this had the best breakfast, with all the usual components ( fruit, different breads, eggs, orange juice, coffee etc.) but done very well. The owner is a charming and friendly lady, helped us find a good dinner spot and offered useful advice. Highly recommended."
 March 2019,5,Super Location - Super Team,"Lovely quiet riad in the medina but easy to find - just walk up the avenue Mohammed V from the railway station, into the medina, continue straight on and it is well sign-posted on the left at the end of the Impasse Souaf. Great base for exploring Rabat and in the heart of the medina. Splendid welcome and all staff extremely friendly and helpful throughout my stay. Fantastic breakfasts on the roof garden every morning - yoghurts, bread, pancakes, eggs, fruit, preserves, cheese, olives, cakes, freshly-squeezed fruit juice, coffee and tea. Very comfortable, cool bedroom with en-suite shower/toilet and plenty of public space in which to unwind. A very peaceful and friendly haven."
 February 2019,5,Great small super clean hotel. Good location.,"Very clean nice hotel. Extremely nice manager. Big comfortable rooms. Very close to main market. Practically on it. Silent and very easy to find, what is a good exception for hotels in Medina. Right in the center. Good wifi ;) with strong signal. Nice view from terrace."
 January 2019,5,Beautiful Riad in the medina,"We had a lovely stay in this beautiful little Riad. Very gracious hosts and pretty rooms gave us an authentic experience. There are a few bedrooms upstairs as well as a living room with kettle, fridge, comfy chairs etc."
 January 2019,5,More than a B&B,"We only spent one night here and it was fantastic. This B&B offers booking a taxi to pick you up at the airport which is definetly worth. Beside charging exactly the same as airport taxis it punctually waits outside the airport, and walks you to the door which is not that easy to find on your own. The owner warmly received us in the traditional fashion with mint tea and some arabian cookies. Although simple our room was very clean and charming. Our only recommendation regarding the room would be placing a shower courtain to prevent water from splasing out while one showers. We had learned from other critics that breakfast was outstanding and could confirm it after finding an array of delicious local produce, a variety of delicious local bread and other treats ike olives,…"
 December 2018,4,A wonderful introduction to Moroccan hospitality,"My husband and I are Indians professionals working in Malaysia. This is our first trip to Africa and were very excited. The host was charming and accommodating. She had the most delicious sweets waiting for us along with the mint tea. Our room was on the first floor and was very charmingly decorated and clean. It was easy to settle in. However, what blew us away was the breakfast. She said that she had baked most of the various pieces of bread and cake and they were moist, delicious and it was really decadent and heartwarming and calorie filled, which my tastebuds did not mind at all! Unfortunately, we only had the night to stay there. A wonderful beginning to a memorable holiday, though later dented with some racism in other hotels."
 November 2018,1,Beware of this Property,"We had booked this property directly in July for a Dec trip, and received confirmation from the hotel thereafter. Only recently did we reconfirm again, only to be told they are sorry but they had a computer problem and our reservation was no longer valid. This Riad only has 5 rooms so that excuse was not believable. Benoit, said he was going to help find other accommodation, but all he found was rooms without a private bathroom or were far more expensive. ( as it is so close to our travel dates). He also mentioned that he had to do this for other clients as well, so it tells me that this establishment double books and then cancels only when you contact them for confirmation. Another part of this story is that we had booked with a company at first only to be contacted by…"
 November 2018,5,A small Moroccan paradise,"In general, staying at a Riad when visiting Morocco is a lifetime experience, especially for people who are from Europe. Staying at this particular Riad in Rabat though is something even more special. Everything was clean and beautiful. The owner, Fadwa, was welcoming and really made sure that you don’t feel just a tourist staying at a room but rather a friend staying at a real home. The place itself is simple yet amazingly decorated with the authentic Moroccan way. If it’s not summertime, we recommend that you stay at the terrace room which is really unique. We thank you for everything. Christina and Andreas"
 November 2018,5,Exceptional,"Everything about this accommodation was great from the date we booked till the end of our short journey. Explanation how to reach hotel came one minute after booking was made. When we arrived nice lady welcomed us with a tea and cookies explaining to us how to reach the main pionts, what to do, where to eat, etc. Rooms are very good, clean, nice decorated. Breakfast was the best during our whole trip in Morocco (it lasted for 14 days). We had a little problem with a bees during our breakfast on the terrace. Maybe that would be my only critic."
 September 2018,4,Visit to Riad Dar Soufa,"Staff was helpful, especially when arranging a taxi to the airport. Check in was seemless and the riad was easy to find. Location was good - within the medina but close enough to exit and explore the rest of Rabat. Having a room on the first floor was a bit noisy with other groups coming and going."
 August 2017,5,Magnificent place,"This beautiful riad is owned by a lovely young couple. They're extremely friendly, just as everyone that works there. It has a family feel. Conveniently located in the middle of the Rabat Medina, on a very safe area. Close to the markets / bazaar. Beautiful rooms, great breakfast. I strongly recommend it. French and English spoken."
 May 2018,5,Everything is perfect,"It's in the heart of the small medina, easy to be access from the Rabat Ville station, and also within ""walkable"" distance to attractions by the seaside. Room is clean and nice, the raid itself is very very relaxing with a nice terrace, where very rich and nice breakfast is served. One thing not to be missed: the host Hamzu is a super nice, helpful and lovely guy."
 April 2018,5,Lovely,Beautiful decor and amazing location in the Médina. Room was clean and well kept. Our host was extremely attentive and helpful. Rooftop breakfast was very good. Excellent communication to assist with smooth arrival.
 April 2018,5,Ideal riad stay in Rabat,"We had little more than half a day at the Riad Dar Soufa, arriving at 9 pm and leaving the next day at 12.30. But it was a thoroughly delightful stay, thanks to the gorgeous interior, special touches like the welcome tea + Moroccan biscuits, excellent breakfast, friendly staff, and first-class location in the medina. We stayed in the wonderful Chambre Zellige, which reputedly is the best in the riad. The decorations are superb, and it was super quiet. Admittedly, having the bathroom at the end of the room, separated by only a curtain that you pull across, is a little odd and far from private, but that was a small price to pay for the otherwise sumptuous surroundings. The riad is within easy walking distance of the main station and much else, including the interesting streets of…"
 April 2018,4,Quick stay,We stayed at this Riad for one night on the way to Chefchaouen. It was a great stop over as many of the Casablanca hotels weren’t the greatest. We felt that we were the only ones staying in this hotel. It’s quite private and quiet. It’s in the old Medina which is easy access to shops and restaurants. The lady who welcomed us was really nice and accommodating. Breakfast was large and filling. I gave it a 4 star because the bed in the morning had water on the sides when we woke up. Overall it was a good experience.
 March 2018,5,"Good location, perfect service and lovely styled Ryad.","We were welcomed with tea and Maroccan cakes by a very friendly lady. Our rooms were clean, lovely decorated and the beds very comfortable. The breakfast was served on the roof terrace. Breakfast was top! Too much for us to eat. We absolutely can recommend this Ryad and we were sorry that we only stayed one night. There is a lot to see in Rabat!"
 January 2018,5,"Nice, cozy, good service, good location",The accommodation is beyond expectation! It is pretty and clean. We are warmly welcomed. The breakfast is great. The wifi is fast. The location is good. Pretty near to the attractions. Highly recommend!
 January 2018,5,New and clean riad in a great position,The riad looks beautiful. It has been recently refurbished and it is very clean. The atrio is also very nice. The staff is very friendly. We got tea and a selection of biscuits as welcome. It is located in a strategic position on a side road to the main Street of the Medina full of shops and small restaurants. It is also not far from a few good parking spots outside the Medina. The breakfast is also very good including a good variety of fresh products. Probably the best riad I have seen in Morocco.
 December 2017,5,"A true gem, highly recommended","The riad is stylishly restored, with a clear Moroccan style, and the comfort you expect of a small boutique hotel. The bed was very comfortable, clean large bathroom with lots of hot water, and absolutely no noice disturbs you except for the faint calling from the minarets. The breakfast is served at the roof terrace and was the best we ever had in Morocco; fresh fruit (lots of it) pancakes, eggs, bread, homemade spreads, cake etc. Thank you very much to the sweet staff of Dar Soufa, and for all your helpful arrangement of driver etc."
 December 2017,5,Best and most authentic Riad around!,"This was my second time visiting, and it has as always been a sheer delight! The architecture is breathtaking, the food is mesmerizing, not to forget that the hostess, Fadwa is the sweetest person ever, helped us get to the Riad even late at night, and is always smiling and welcoming. Also, the rooms were very clean, and the place very safe. We had a very delicious breakfast, especially the msemen which was the best we ever had in our life! If you want to visit the city and be confortable it’s the place to be, no hesitation! Will come back for sure."
 October 2017,4,Excellent riad,"The entrance, in a narrow street, is terrible but once inside you forget it and it is a very nice and comfortable riad. Perfect location in the middle of the medina. Good service, nice rooms and excellent breakfast. What do you want more?"
 October 2017,1,Stranded at the Train Station!,"There are so many things that I did like about this place, including the location and the quaintness of the place, but I would not stay here again. First, I had confirmed multiple times that we would have a porter pick us up at the train station and take us to the Riad as we had only one night in Rabat and wanted to maximize our time exploring. I confirmed with the Riad twice before we left and provided them with our train times the night before. We arrived at 12PM and waited for the porter until 12:30PM. We called the Riad twice and they kept on telling us to wait for 5 more minutes until he came, but he never showed up. We had to walk to the Riad on our own since the medina does not allow cars to enter, with two people and six pieces of luggage. The walk was 10 minutes,…"
 October 2017,5,Outstanding riad in rabat,"Extremely clean and retro riad with only 4 rooms in Rabat. Very fast and strong WiFi, a rarity at other roads we have visited. Breakfast was extensive. Location was good, with easy access to train station and restaurants outside the Médina. Redb, the operator of the riad was very helpful and kind. It was an extremely unusual hot period in October when I visited and he was able to provide an extra fan for our room of 3. Unfortunately the website for the hotel shows the rooms have air conditioning which is simply not true. There is NO ac at this riad. Despite that, the positives far outweighed the negatives here and would recommend this riad."
 September 2017,5,Great start to our stay,"Our Riad booked our taxi for us to pick us up at the airport. the taxi driver was great, parked up and navigated us through the Medina to the Riad which we may have struggled to find on our own. We had such a warm welcome and provided with delicious mint tea and biscuits. The room was beautiful and well laid out with great artwork. It was very cosy and was everything we needed. The bed was extremely comfy. In the morning we ate breakfast on the terrace which was delicious. All in all the perfect start to our first trip to Morocco. We were very well looked after. I would definitely recommend this Riad, and wouldnt hesitate in returning. Thank you for a great stay."
 September 2017,5,Don't hesitate,"The riad is stunning, very decorative. The rooftop terrace give perfect opportunity to relax. A little bit pricey but you won't find cheaper accomodations on this level in Rabat. Very easy to get to. Big and tasty breakfast."
 June 2017,4,Good stay,"My first Riad stay and did not know what to expect. But overall a small and cosy place. The rooms were industrial chic and looked very instagram-able. However if you're travelling with friends or family, get a room with proper door that separates the bedroom rom the toilet. My room literally only had a metal cabinet in between the shower and the bed. Breakfast was good and the host was friendly."
 May 2017,5,"Stunning dar, great breakfast, amazing beds.","This dar is absolutely stunning - I would make a trip back to Rabat just to stay here again! We stayed in the zellij room, which was gorgeous, decorated with beautiful cut tiles. The beds are so. comfortable. Samira, who runs the day to day operations was a complete gem, super helpful and sweet, going out of her way to get tea and simple food for my dad, who got a bit of a bug. Breakfast on the terrace was AMAZING - an array of homemade breads & pastries, fresh fruit, cheeses, olives... heavenly. There is a sunny terrace - not particularly for the view, but lovely to read outside or get some sun. Close to the entrance to the medina (Rue Tajine) which makes the journey on foot relatively easy. They also organized a driver to the airport in Casablanca for us at a good rate which…"
 April 2017,5,Beautiful traditional riad,"Gorgeous individually decorated rooms overlooking the central courtyard. Beds are comfortable, and truthfully we didn't miss having a TV -- a day wandering around the medina can be exhausting, so we were happy to crash into bed after our evening meal. They do have free wifi. Breakfast on the terrace was outstanding."
 April 2017,5,Wonderful!,The room is very clean and quiet ! And Semira very kind lady. Welcome tea and sweets were fantastic !The breakfast was great!!. Thank you very much Semira ! 素晴らしかったです‼️女主人のスミラは優しいし食事は美味しかったです。ウェルカムドリンクのお菓子がゴージャスでした。
 April 2017,4,Great location in the middle of Medina.,"The location is perfect in the middle of Medina. Walkable to tram amd train station, also tourist sites. And there are also many famous restaurants around it. The breakfast at the terrace is so beautiful and delicious. The minuses are, there is no fridge and TV in the room so it's really boring at night."
 April 2017,5,Exceeded expectations!,"Wow! This Riad far exceeded our expectations. It is a cosy setup in the heart of the medina. The building design and finishes are authentic, yet top class. The hosts were extremely accommodating and always keen to assist. We were welcomed with mint tea and an array of snacks on the terrace. We enjoyed them while watching the sunset and listening to the ""call to prayer"". The breakfast is plentiful and very tasty. The room we stayed in was tastefully decorated, with a very comfortable bed. This is a beautiful and quiet haven, In amongst the hustle and bustle of the medina. All in all we would highly recommend this Riad to anyone traveling to Rabat."
 January 2017,5,Great find in beautiful Rabat,"Situated in the heart of the medina this Riad was decorated beautifully and was a welcome stay for us on a ""morocco by train"" tour. I recommend taking breakfast on the terrace. The staff were very friendly too. Rabat is my favourite city so far. We've also been in Marrakesh and Casablanca ."
 January 2017,5,Beautiful riad in the medina of Rabat,"Wonderfully located riad. Nicely renovated, beautifully decorated. The service is good, though there was some confusion over staying a second night. Breakfast is nice but access is a bit of a struggle. We would come back at any time!"
 January 2017,5,A lovely family B&B in the heart of old Medina,"We stayed for just one night in this small quaint hotel with basic, but modern facilities in January 2017. The downside was that cars and taxis could not come to the hotel doors as it is in the pedestrian zone. As soon as we booked this hotel online, the hotel sent us clear information on this aspect and requested us to get in touch once we reached Rabat so that they could guide us. Our taxi dropped us at the entrance of the old medina market and rang the hotel. The lady receptionist Fedwa requested us to wait there , within three minutes came to meet us and escorted us to the hotel. As long as your baggage has canisters, this short walk of two/three minutes is no strain. The lobby was decorated with minimal artefacts and was saviours, bright and airy. We were put in a room on…"
 December 2016,5,A very pleasant stay in a beautiful Riad with abundance of character,"I initially booked three nights at this beautiful Riad but then extended for additional two nights. The location is great, in the hub of Median which makes easy walking distance to all the sightseeing. I was so welcomed and looked after by all the staff at this Riad, nothing I say will be enough for the hospitality, generosity, friendly and warm stay that I had. No request was too much or burdensome, the staff were there to facilitate all my needs and more. I felt like I was at home and in awe of the decoration of the Riad, such beautifully and tastefully carried out. Without a doubt if I am back at Rabat this is the place I will be staying and recommending it to all my friends. Thank you so much for making my stay such a pleasant experience."
 November 2016,5,"Beautiful riad, happy stay","This is a beautifully restored riad in the old medina, and a lovely place to stay. Benoit is a charming and very helpful host and his love for the riad is infectious. Our room was beautifully furnished - the curtain for the bathroom was unusual but we soon got used to that! We were welcomed with mint tea and delicious pastries and breakfast on the roof everyday was a feast, with fresh, homemade yogurt and Moroccan pastries and bread, eggs and lots of coffee. We couldn't have stayed in a nicer place."
 October 2016,5,Magnificent quiet riad,"We stayed her with our family of 5 (kids age 11,9 and 7). Benoit the owner was just wonderful and super supportive in every way. The riad is small but very tastefully and spacious rooms! Would definitely Stay again. Pro - Benoit the very helpful owner - One of the cleanest riad we have seen - Very lush and complete breakfest - Not to expensive casablanca airport transfer for our family of five. Con's - I can think of none. Would definitely stay here again when visiting rabat"
 October 2016,5,Only four rooms with excellent service,"Benoit made our stay comfortable and informative in this 150 yr old renovated Riad within the medina. He arranged a driver to pick us up at Casablanca airport and had us delivered to the front door down a clean alley. The breakfast with fruits, coffee, yogurt, eggs, warm breads and pastries and creams was amazing. It changed on the second day. The bedroom was excellent, stylish and quiet"
 October 2016,5,Amazing,"The location of the Riad is fantastic with 15 mins walking distance from the train station. Benoit is really nice and helpful. The room is spacious, cosy and most important, clean! A sitting The breakfast is really nice. I am sure I will back to this riad if I visit Rabat again!"
 October 2016,5,If you are going to Rabat you couldn't stay in a better place,The location of the Riad is fantastic. Easy walking distance from the train station and inside the medina but up a quite alley way. Benoit and his mum are very welcoming and helpful hosts. Their breakfast was generous and fresh. Our room was very funky and comfortable. As non smokers being on the top floor was an advantage.
 September 2016,5,Beautiful dar centrally located with wonderful host,"Riad Dar Soufa is a beautifully restored dar located right in the medina. It is close the train station, the kasbah and many other Rabat sights.The room was wonderful and very comfortable. The host, Benoit, was friendly and extremely helpful, explaining to us how to get around and the best way to visit various sites. We only stayed at this guesthouse one night, but wished we could have stayed longer."
 September 2016,5,Couldnt make a better choice of Riad in Rabat!!,"Benoit is the best host and made our first experience in Morocco as enjoyable as it can be. Although he perplexed the room allocation which he informed me a few days beforehand I was so glad we sticked to this Riad. Very helpful, talkative, gave us guidance for the city and where to go, totally friendly. The Riad itseld is beautiful, in a great location, perfectly clean and tidy. The breakfast is epic! Warm, fresh bread and a variety of things to start the day full. I really hope one day i end up visiting Rabat again and to stay at Riad Dar Soufa again!"
 August 2016,5,Every Reason To Stay,"There is every reason to stay at Dar Soufa. The proprietor, Benoit, is always available in person and by email to answer your zillions of questions, arrange transfer to and from the airport, and give suggestions for restaurants and stuff to see. Upon our arrival we were greeted warmly and generously, with an already-AC-cooled room, a bottle of chilled water and some local pastries. When we settled in, Benoit treated us to mint tea, apricots and dates. The rooms are stunning, with carved arches above the beds, high wooden ceilings, mosaic inlays on the walls and oversized wooden entry doors. The riad is impeccably clean and well maintained. Make sure not to miss the breakfast on the roof terrace, it is sumptuous and endlessly ample: every imaginable bread, spreads, fruits, home…"
 July 2016,5,Wonderful little Riad,"Benoit was a great host. The breakfast was delicious. In fact it was one of the best in our week long trip. Great location. Benoit was very helpful with a dinner recommendation. Overall, we loved out stay."
 April 2016,5,Deserves the No. 1 Rating,"This was my first riad experience and it was so great that I decided I will not stay anywhere but a riad for the rest of my vacation. I was only there for a day but the owner Benoit made my stay very pleasant. Very helpful with his suggestions about the city and very good in the kitchen! The breakfast at Riad Dar Soufa was undoubtedly the best I had anywhere during my stay in Morocco. I will try and include a photograph of the spread as well. The room was beautiful and was a very authentic Moroccan riad experience. The layout and the furnishings were very traditional and was a good start to the trip, made me look forward to the rest of my riad stays."
 May 2016,5,One Charming Riad and One Charming Host!,"We had an amazing one night stay at this Riad, all thanks to the incredible kindness of our host, Benoit. The Riad is within the Medina, walking distance from local shops and restaurants. It is a charming place with clean and spacious rooms. Even though we had originally had booked two rooms that could sleep 5 adults, Benoit kindly offered us an additional room at no cost. His breakfast at the rooftop is an experience on its own as he sets the table with such care. We could not have asked for a better place or a better host for our stay in Riad. Immensely thankful for the memories made."
 May 2016,5,"Beautiful riad, great host, delicious breakfast",This riad was one of our favourites when traveling in Morocco. We had a second-floor room and enjoyed the view from rooftop terrace. Our host was really helpful and even gave us a map with local sights. The breakfast was the best we had in Morocco.
 March 2016,5,Enjoyable & Stress-free Stay!,"Riad Dar Soufa was a wonderfully relaxing place to stay. The Riad's renovation was based on traditional Moroccan designs, but included all the expected modern features and contemporary furnishings. But what our group of six travelers liked most about our stay was the host. Benoit was personable and passionate about making sure our visit was enjoyable. The roof top breakfast was always delicious & visually appealing. During one breakfast a preserved lemon jam was served. I mentioned to Benoit how much I liked the jam. At the next morning's breakfast Benoit gave me two jars of the jam, free of charge. That kind of attention to detail was a big part that made this a great stay."
 April 2016,5,Absolutely Beautiful,"Benoit was incredibly nice and welcoming. You can tell this riad is his passion, and he was happy to explain all the details of his renovations. The breakfast was wonderful, served on the beautiful rooftop terrace--delicious moroccan pancakes, pastries, jams, coffee, homemade yogurt, fresh squeezed juice. Absolutely perfect. It was nice to finally relax at the end of our trip on the chaise lounges late in the afternoon. Easy walk from there to sea wall. He also arranged private taxi to the airport from his riad (60 dirhams, about 2 hours)--so a great alternative to Casablanca. There is also a less expensive train to the airport."
 April 2016,5,"A lovely, intimate gem","This is a lovely, intimate gem of a riad located right off the main street of the small medina in Rabat. Benoit, the owner, spent 2 years rebuilding it, and he has done an exquisite job. Benoit is also knowledgeable, charming, and was as helpful to us as he could have been, arranging a second night at a different riad for us as Dar Soufa was full the second night. And the Dar Soufa breakfasts were the best we encountered among 9 places we stayed: delicious locally-made yogurt, great French pastries, fresh orange juice, mounds of fresh strawberries, and good coffee. A find!"
 April 2016,5,An Unforgettable Stay,"Spent our first night in Morocco here and it was a perfect welcome to the country. I was travelling with my parents and relatives and they really enjoyed this riad. It was quite an experience having to walk through the medina (which was not as overwhleming as the ones in Fes and Marrakech) to this wonderful riad. Beautiful rooms and patio. The excellent breakfast on the rooftop terrace was divine!! The gracious host helped and gave us pointers on touring the city. He arranged for a taxi to meet us at the airport (same price as haggling on the street, that is if you can get it that low, and with a sign waiting for us). Had an issue with an airline and he did his best to help us as much as he could to resolve the issue. My only regret was we only stayed there for one night."
 March 2016,5,Great riad well placed in the Rabat Medina,"This is a wonderful riad conveniently located in the relatively small Medina of Rabat. While we were there, the alleyway leading to the front door was being excavated for new drainage pipes, but it was fixed by the time we left. The owner, Benoit was really great in making sure that all our luggage was safely transported from the parking area to the riad. He also helped us arrange the parking. The riad is absolutely beautiful and wonderfully restored. We stayed in the Zellij Room, named after the tiled walls and while probably the prettiest of the rooms, rooftop activity over the room was noticeable at different times of day. Nothing really disturbing, but the other rooms may be quieter. The breakfast, very typical of Morocco, was fresh, ample and delicious. It could be…"
 March 2016,5,Agree with all previous ratings and comments,"Nicest stay in our 10 night holiday in Morocco. Would definitely recommend it. Owner is very nice and helpful, rooms are great, so was breakfast. We received some nice tips for our visit in both Rabat and the rest of our journey."
 January 2016,5,Possibly Our Favorite Place We Have Ever Stayed,"Riad Dar Soufa is a magical step into another world. The beautiful rooms and inner courtyard, the perfect Moroccan hospitality, and overall peacefulness and charm combine to make Dar Soufa the perfect respite for weary travelers. It's accommodations like this that help transform a trip into an unforgettable experience. My wife and I recommend Riad Dar Soufa without reservation."
 January 2016,5,The place to stay in Rabat!,"Really great Riad in a great city. This place was our introduction to Morocco, Rabat and Riads; so glad we choose this place. It is an amazing boutique hotel at a very reasonable price. The best breakfast we had in Morocco, hands down. The real gem of this place is the owner, Benoit, not only did he help me out getting a cell phone for our month trip, he set it up for us!"
 January 2016,4,its nice but only for one night,"to get to this b&b you have to search for it through the chaotic medina,. we must´ve asked about 8 people til we eventually found it down a dark alley. on entereing 1st impressions were good. but after that it went slowly downhill. the room was a litlle strange resembled a museum than a hotel room, uncomfortable shower area with wc seperated by a thin curtain, i ask you."
 December 2015,5,What a beautiful place!,This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed in! What a surprise when you open the door .We were so glad we added Rabat and Riad dar Soufa last minute. We arrived and we were warmly greeted by the owner and designer Benoit. My daughter was sick and he was extremely helpful making sure we could go to the room right away. We also extended our stay another day and He accommodated us in another room on the roof deck. He advised us to call with his phone the other Riad in Chefchaouen to postpone our arrival. The place was gorgeous. I wish I could live there. It was a perfect combination of modern and classic. More beautiful than any picture. It was perfect for us to be able to sit and relax in the salons near our room and go on wifi while our daughter rested. We left…
 December 2015,5,Great way to kick off our travels!,"My husband and I loved our stay at Riad Dar Soufa!! Absolutely recommended if you are staying in Rabat: * I contacted Benoit prior to our stay and he was always prompt with responding and with helpful answers * Benoit made sure to be available for our arrival at Riad Dar Soufa even when we were incredibly delayed from our flight from Casablanca. He also provided great detailed instructions on how to get to Riad Dar Soufa - we got in late at night and had to navigate the medina in the dark by foot but were able to get to the riad with no issues from the train station. The location can't be beat, easy to navigate to various things during our stay and was safe even when late at night. * We were leaving for Chefchaouen shortly after and Benoit kindly purchased our bus tickets in…"
 December 2015,4,Tranquil oasis in Rabat's busy Medina,"This is a well renovated Riad just off a busy thoroughfare of the bustling Medina. (Beware - the Medina is a living, breathing creature and not sanitised for tourists!). Facilities are basic (don't look for a TV or coffee maker - but I think that applies to most Riads) although wifi is good. The French owner is friendly, attentive and helpful."
 December 2015,5,"Charming, peaceful and lovely staff","Absolutely amazing riad at medina's heart. From this place you can go by walk to all touristic and interesting places in Rabat. The room was clean, spacious and very light. The style is a mixture of classic and modern riad, with many details carefully selected for your comfort. The breakfast is marvellous. They serve it at roof terrace and it comes with drinks, fruit, yogurt and selection of bread and jams. The person who was in charge at our stay was Benoit. He was very kind, helpful and friendly. You can trust him all your inquiries. It seems a good place if you want to explore Rabat or just to stay and relax. Very good value for money and definitely I would come back to stay here."
 December 2015,5,The most beautiful riad I've ever stayed,"This riad is simply perfect. The location is ideal and the delicate decoration makes you feels like you are in a 5* hotel. Benoir is very kind and always attentive, giving tips about everything, even for another cities.we had the breakfast included and we had it in the terrace with a wide range of different breads and jams, fruits, coffee and yogurt. I have already recommended to my family and undoubtely I will come back."
 October 2015,5,Perfect riad,"Had an amazing stay in this very stylish Moroccan riad. The breakfast selection was delicious; a lot of effort had obviously gone into sourcing the best ingredients for for example the olives, honey and the cheese, which were delicious. The owner, Benoir, was very friendly and gave us great advice on where to eat and sight see. Had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay here and will definitely return. Great attention to detail, highly recommended."
 October 2015,5,3nights....,"If I only could have more days off.. I would love to go back to Rabat!... and one more thing: it would definitely be the lovely Riad. Wow..such an amazing place, I was so glad I had chosen the place :).. fantastic stay, great wifi Got lost on the way to the guest house. But it was totally worth it. Absolutely amazing and delicious breakfast, yummy:) Would come back next year:)"
 October 2015,5,Best riad!,"The basics can be taken for granted here; the small touches are great (e.g. delicious almond biscuits with the mint tea); the modern design connects with the traditional in a totally satisfying way. And the wifi was a dream! Top marks, and for us a fantastic end to a brilliant holiday."
 October 2015,5,The Right Spot in Rabat,"This was a perfect spot to begin our Moroccan vaction. The riad was spotless,cozy & charming. Our room was the perfect temperature. It was air condtioned and the lighting was great.The breakfast was delicious. It is in a convienient location inside the medina. Benoit recommended a fabulous restaurant within walking distance. Keep in mind that the bathroom is seperated from the room by a curtain and there are stairs to reach the rooms. Neither of those features detracted from this property."
 September 2015,5,Fabulous place and ownership,"This riad is an incredible place to stay. We arrived very late and Benoit set up airport transport that was waiting for us and walked us through the confusing streets of medina to the riad. The riad and room were spotless, breakfast was fantastic and Benoit was helpful with every detail from the best places to eat and visit to helping us contact the airline and checking on our lost luggage. The rooftop is an great place to relax in the afternoon as is the reading room. I recommend this riad to anyone visiting Rabat."
 September 2015,5,Fantastic place in Rabat!,"Benoit couldn't have been more helpful, which is worth a lot in confusing surroundings! He booked us a taxi that knew the riad and came to greet us at the airport. Amazingly clean and what a breakfast on the roof top, felt like 5*! Great tips for exploring the city and beyond too, thank you!"
 June 2015,5,Beautiful Dar,May 2015 the Dar is very clean and have a beautiful unique and relaxing decoration the location is in good spot inside the old city of rabat. You can go around the city by walking the owner benoit is very helpful and kind french man. Their breakfast was the best we had in our morocco tour . Lovely experience at the dar soufa. I hope to go again.
 May 2015,5,Best place to stay in Rabat,"Can't imagine better place to stay in Rabat. We stayed in top floor room and it was beautiful. Everything was nice and clean, Bed was comfortable and big enough for a 2m tall man. There was no things to complain about. Highly recommend this place."
 May 2015,5,Wonderful stay,"Benoit was an amazing and very gracious host. We missed our original flight and had to take a flight a day later. Benoit was very considerate concerning our first booked night. He also helped us arrange transport from Casablanca airport to the riad in Rabat. Upon arrival he greeted us with fresh orange, amazing Moroccan pastries and fresh tea. The breakfast was also outstanding! The room itself was spacious and clean with lovely decor. The only qualm we could envisage is that there is no door between the room and the bathroom, however there is a toilet downstairs you can use! Great way to arrive in morocco and get back on track after a rocky start. Thank you for your hospitality Benoit!"
 April 2015,5,EXCEPTIONAL VALUE,We are two couples and we have just spent 3 nights at Dar Soufa in Rabat Medina. First the good: The rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed. Be aware they are open plan with the bathroom/toilet part of the bedroom - separated by a curtain or dressing screen. The beds were very comfortable and the furnishings elegant and tasteful including a pair of chairs to relax in. There was a separate lounge room area where guests could gather to read and relax and the roof terrace with sunchairs and eating area was an oasis of calm. The whole riad has been recently renovated and is exquisitely appointed. The quiet luxury is a welcome relief after a day in the chaos of the Medina The location in the centre of the riad was relatively easy to find and extremely good value for money. …
 April 2015,5,Warm and welcoming,After a long days travel we arrived at Dar Ben Soufa and Benoit immediately made us feel relaxed and comfortable. The place is stunning with a great terrace where Benoit served tea and snacks and gave us a great overview of Rabat. Benoit is very warm and welcoming and that homey feeling is felt all around his charming guest house.
 March 2015,5,Perfect Riad,"Bennoit gave us a kind welcome and a lot of recommendations. Great Riad, the most stylish (and we had the cheapest room) and most beautiful on our tour through Morocco. Breakfast was also fantastic, will deserved on the roof top The room, the complete Riad is very clean"
 March 2015,4,Riad Dar Soufa,"This Riad combines the traditional art of Morocco with some modern and functional decoration ideas. Very easy to find as you just have to enter the medina, go straight ahead (about 250 m) and just look on the small streets on your left hand for the sigh. When we arrived there we met Benoit, a really good and polite guy with a big smile who helped as with the lugguges and offered us some mint tea. He suggested us some great places and kept our lugguges the next day after our check out until the time we left. The Riad was really clean, luminous and airy. Is situated near one of the medina's big streets where the night market takes place. It's location is advantageous as you don't have to wander inside the medina's small alleys if you arrive at night."
 October 2014,5,A paradise of its own,"The riad is beautifully designed, a combination of traditional and modern flavor. It may be difficult to find for the first time, but once you found it, you will notice its location is pretty convenient. Benoit is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was plentiful. It was a lovely stay."
 August 2014,4,Great hotel! one thing to fix..,"This riad is very pretty inside, it is typical but has a modern twist. As a matter of fact the owner is French and I think that the European touch was visible in many aspects of the service and this was positive. Benoit was very friendly and he immediately give us water, directions for monuments and for restaurants. The room was very very very beautiful, I loved the stile and it was large. The only thing is that there was a curtain dividing bathroom and bedroom and I 'm sorry this is ridiculous for The price we paid. I need privacy at least in the bathroom!! The breakfast was incredible, very rich and the ingredients fresh and top quality ( French Know good food), we especially loved the home made yogurt and would like the recipe. last but not least the position is great for…"
 August 2014,4,Fantastic riad just at the beginning if the medina,"Located in the immediate proximity of medina doors (easily reachable from the train station) the riad Dar Soufa offers a very charming atmosphere. The place shows the influence of European taste, but keeps the atmosphere of the traditional riad, both in the architecture and rooms decoration. The breakfast is, as usual in Marocco, outstanding offering fresh bread, pancakes, galettes and a wide range of jams. Benoit, the riad manager, is very kind and smart. He gave us some precious suggestions to visit Rabat and eat a good dinner in the medina."
 May 2014,5,A great place to stay,This Riad is perfectly situated within the medina once you have arrived in the area follow the instructions emailed to you rather than accepting help from the parking attendents! The rooms are very comfortable with lovely tadelakt surfaces in the bathroom area. The centre of the Riad has traditional tiles and plasterwork with stairs leading up to a fabulous terrace where an amazing breakfast is served. Benoit made us very welcome and was happy to suggest places to eat and areas in the city to visit.
 June 2014,5,An oasis,"Friendly and welcoming staff in a lovely and genuine Dar in the heart of the old town. The breakfast was probably the best that we have ever experienced: lovely breads, fantastic preserves and fresh fruit."
 June 2014,5,Just perfect!,"Just returned from 3 nights here and it was wonderful. Really well located in the medina, close to the tram and close to loads of shopping. The owner was really helpful about places to go, suggestions of restaurants and things to see. And the breakfast was just amazing! Cannot rate this place highly enough."
 May 2014,5,excellent authentic stay in beautiful Rabat,"We only spent one night at Riad Dar Soufa, but after being there for mere minutes and listening to Benoit's excellent suggestions and recommendations, we wished we were staying for longer! Benoit gave us superb recommendations for sight seeing and restaurants for both lunch and dinner. He also cooked us the best breakfast of our entire trip and served it to us on the riad's beautiful rooftop terrace. The riad's location was very convenient and close to the medina. We also were within walking distance of the beach, kasbah, and other sites. Our room was also adorable, with just the right amount of traditional Moroccan decor. Benoit was also very understanding of our concerns of traveling in a new country (neither of us had ever been to a ""3rd world"" country, Africa, or a muslim…"
 May 2014,5,Beautiful riad,"We stayed 3 nights. The riad is beautifully restored and is modern yet retains its original charm. It is right next to the shopping area in the Medina but as all the rooms face inward it is very quiet. The owner, Benoit, is extremely helpful. Breakfast is served on the terrace. One small issue is that the toilets in the rooms are only separated from the living area by a curtain. For those embaressed by communal bowel movements there is a conventional toilet on the ground floor."
 April 2014,5,Excellent Family Run Riad!,"We stayed in Riad Dar Soufa for a week at the beginning of April. It was a very relaxing stay - what we wanted - and made all the more so by Christine and her son Benoit. Nothing was too much trouble! Benoit spoke very good English, was around most of the time and helped in every way he could. He's a fountain of knowledge when it comes to sights to see, places to go etc. Christine, although very helpful, spoke little English. This didn't stop her from doing everything she could to make our stay very enjoyable. We would highly recommend this excellent Riad. Located in the heart of the Medina means that if you want to see the hustle and bustle of a Moroccan Medina/Souks you only need to leave your Riad, walk 20m to the end of the alleyway and there you are! Easy walking…"
 March 2014,5,"Welcoming, lovely building, good breakfast and friendly hosts",I only stayed at Dar Soufa one night but found it excellent. It was located in a good spot in the medina close to shopping areas and reasonably close to the railway station from where I was catching a train to Fes. The room was comfortable and the building well designed with clean lines and the lovely Moroccan embellishments. The roof terrace was lovely. Delicious breakfast. Benoit and Christine were readily available for any advice or arrangement or just a good conversation.
 November 2013,5,Excellent Riad,We recently stayed at the Riad Dar Soufa. It is a perfect location to visit Rabat since it is in the middle of the medina. We were able to walk everywhere. The owners Benoit and Christine were gracious and outgoing. We felt that we were their house guests. Our room was delightful. We had an excellent breakfast on the roof top patio. I would highly recommend this hotel. We only wish that we could have stayed another night. They also arranged a pick up at the airport.
 March 2014,5,"Great location, clean, friendly and a good breakfast too!","Both Benoit and Christine were friendly, helpful and simply lovely - Christine even made me wish that I could speak French. Thank you for your help in getting a candle for the cake :-D The Riad was clean and welcoming with a pleasant roof terrace. Our room was a fair size, with a comfortable bed, small seating area and bathroom. Some people might be a little uncomfortable with the toilet arrangements in so far as you can see each other using the loo . . . . a small screen separates the bedroom from the bathroom . . . . .not a problem for us, but worth mentioning for those who only ever make love in the dark. I would highly recommend this Riad and would not hesitate to stay here again."
 October 2013,5,Excellently restored riad in the heart of Rabat's medina,"Arriving at Rabat Ville station by train, you only need a 10' walk down the road and into the Medina to get to Riad Dar Soufa. The entrance is 20m down a narrow alley, off one of the main shopping streets within the Medina. There you will be greeted by the adorable Benoit with his excellent English who will bend over backwards to serve his guests! The Riad has been restored with excellent taste and at a very high standard. Rooms are spacious with beautiful detailing. We also liked the good quality toiletries available in the room. Only criticism is that the bed mattress was a bit too soft. I find firmer mattresses more comfortable. The breakfast, served on the terrace of course, is very good. Benoit is always at hand to give helpful tips for sightseeing and dinning options."
 November 2013,5,Marvelous Riad,"We were initially very skeptical about taking the time to spend a night in Rabat, but the city turned out to be a pleasant surprise and Riad Dar Soufa one of the hotel highlights of our trip. It's in the heart of the Rabat medina, but an easy walk to most anywhere. Owned by a wonderfully friendly French national, he renovated this Riad with loving care. He also decided to use relatively simple, contemporary furnishings that really worked well. The meals were some of the best and served with a real European flair."
 September 2013,4,"Best breakfast, nice stay","We stayed in 5 riads in Morocco and here we had the best breakfast! An extra plus was that we could enjoy it at the roof terrace of the Riad. The Riad was nice, clean, had a great location and looked very new. Our room had a very high ceiling, which was lovely, but was a little bit too bright during the night. The host Benoit was very helpful to us. Furthermore Rabat is a very lovely place to relax, so go there and stay here! Greetings from Belgium"
 October 2013,5,Beautiful Riad in the centre of Rabat,We stayed in this beautiful Riad for two nights in October. We booked their Sellige Room which is the most traditional one of the house. We loved the room and it’s decoration. It felt like we were sleeping in the Alhambra palace in Granada. The room and the bed were very comfortable. Like others mentioned the bathtub was a little simple and the water stayed in it for a while when we took a shower bus for us this was part of the authentic room. Like our room the whole Riad is beautiful restored with an eye for even the smallest details. Benoit showed a huge hospitality during our stay. He was very helpful all day long and he spoke English very well. The breakfast was served on the roof terrace and was one of the best we got during our three weeks trip through Morocco. This was…
 October 2013,5,Excellent medina stay,"Very good place with a very nice french owner. The place is quite and has a great terasse. Its located right in the hearth of the medina, the kasbah is a 5min walk and hassan tower about 25min walk. We love the good breakfast too. Wlan is working fine."
 October 2013,5,Fantastic stay!,"Very nice riad right in the medina. A bit hard to find... taxi dropped us off on the main street and had some trouble finding it. But once inside, a 180 degree different than the hustle and bustle of the medina. The owner is extremely helpful and friendly. Great breakfast on the roof terrace. Great decoration and character for the rooms. Wonderful stay!"
 September 2013,5,Wonderful riad!,"Lovely riad in the medina, located within a 10-15 minute walk of the train station. Christine provided a map and helpful suggestions for finding the riad. She was very welcoming, and we were able to communicate quite well with our limited French. We followed her recommendation for dinner (Tajine wa Tanjiia), which was very good. We loved the stunning terrace room, and enjoyed the terrace itself for relaxing moments during the day and evening. The breakfast on the terrace was outstanding. The location is perfect. We were able to walk everywhere."
 September 2013,5,Recommended,"This is a lovely place to stay, and the guy who runs it couldn't be more helpful. A beautiful building, and the breakfasts are tasty and served in huge quantities! On piece of advice we'd want to give is that if you arrive by train you're better off walking to the Riad rather than getting a taxi -- the journey on foot shouldn't take more than about 15 mins, and if you've get a map from the Riad owners and follow it carefully the place isn't too difficult to find."
 August 2013,4,Nice place in the heart of the medina,"Beautiful building once you step inside, lovely architecture and decoration, lovely rooftop terrace, located in the heart of the medina. Christine was very friendly and helpful, even if we struggled a bit with communication - our french is poor and she only speaks french. Delicious breakfast. Rooms are big and have very comfortable beds, personally i didn't like the fact that the toilet isn't divided from the room, there is only a narrow (maybe 1,5m x 2m) cloth screen separating the bedroom from the bathroom. If you have some heavy luggage get ready to carry it for a 5 to 10 minutes walk from the street where you can park the car until the Dar Soufa, as you can't take cars into that part of the medina. Overall it's a charming place and i would go back."
 September 2013,4,You pay for what you get!,"This is a stunning riad in Rabat medina within walking distance of the railway station (~15 mins). The rooms are extremely comfortable, however the bathroom is separated from the bedroom only by a curtain. There were lots of nice little touches : bottled water, extra pillows, cushions, lamps, hairdryer, cakes on arrival, dates, fruit salad and yoghurt with breakfast… The riad is excellent, however we have rated it very good because you pay for what you get!"
 September 2013,5,Simply amazing,Just a short walk from the trainstation and directly in the Medina. Market just around the corner but still its a very relaxing quiet place just next to all the chaos. Very nice rooftop terrace and super nice rooms! Very welcoming staff. youll have everything you need here.
 July 2013,4,A calm respite in the busy Medina,"We really enjoyed our stay at Riad Dar Soufa. We originally booked for one night, but stayed an extra night. The owner, Christina, was very friendly, though French is her main language and we only speak English. We managed to use Google Translate to communicate though and managed fine. The riad itself is beautiful and our room was very comfortable. A bit tricky to find, but we used Google Maps and we managed to find it without having to ask directions. I think we probably had the smallest (i.e. cheapest) room ,but it was big enough. The bathroom was big, but there is only a curtain separating it from the main room, so not a huge amount of privacy...fine for us though as a couple. Would definitely recommend!"
 February 2013,5,Friendly Dar on a top location,"This Dar is a bit hard to find in the medina of Rabat. Ask first the owner to send you a map and the directions to the dar. Signs in the street lack, so count the numbers of the street very well. The staff is very friendly and help you with everything. The nice breakfast is served on the first floor. There is wifi with low broadband. We had the beautiful room on the toplevel (terrace). Very good bed and all in moroccon style with tadelakt bathroom. Parking of the car is a bit of a problem but the staff will help you with your package and find a good and safe place (public underground car park about 5 min walking distance; cost 10 euro/day)."
 January 2013,5,"Thank you, Beniot!","I stayed at Riad Dar Soufa with two friends the weekend of January 25-27, 2013. We are all American and were traveling through Spain and made a side trip to Rabat. From the moment a friend of Benoit's spotted us in the medina and escorted us to the front door of the Riad, our expectations were met and exceeded constantly. Benoit was helpful, accommodating and friendly. His English is great and his breakfast was fabulous. Our room (Zerka) was impeccably clean and all of our needs were met. Though the room was small, it was beautiful and well-kept. I think it has been pointed out that the bathroom is separated from the room by a curtain, which is a little bit different from what I'm used to, but I was traveling with good, easy going people so it really wasn't a big deal. There…"
 December 2012,5,Cute Riad,"We stayed here for one night. The owner/manager was very helpful, and gave good restaurant recommendations. He is French, but speaks English too. The Riad was well-maintained, centrally located, and served a nice breakfast. Recommended."
 December 2012,4,"Nice riad, good value, good location","My husband and I stayed for one night in the Zerka Room (Zerka means blue in Arabic, the room has a painted blue cedar ceiling) of the Riad Dar Soufa. We liked this riad, which is decorated in a much more understated manner than several other riads in which we have stayed; it is still beautiful, with plenty of Moroccan features and design elements, but not with the busy multicolored and occasionally contrasting (to some people more used to western styles) patterns that some riads have and is pretty typical in Moroccan homes and palaces. This riad is in a good location down on a short side street off of a main street (Avenue Mohammed V) through the Rabat medina. Our room was smallish but by no means cramped, and we knew that going in as the pictures on the website (not currently…"
 November 2012,5,Loved it!,"We stayed in this Riad for a night in November 2012 and we regretted not staying for a longer period of time in this place. Immediately after booking the accommodation online, we received an email from the Riad providing us with directions and other useful tips in getting to the hotel. The Riad is located right in the middle of Rabat's medina (which is absolutely tout-free and very pleasant to explore). The Riad is down a little turn right after a maternity wear shop and is thus a perfect hideout from the busy medina. We were warmly welcomed by the staff who served us an amazing selection of Moroccan pastries with tea. The bedroom was spectacular. Spacious, with modern, artsy furnishings and an incredibly comfortable bed. Breakfast was great, and the food recommendations…"
 October 2012,4,Well taken care of...,"My partner and I pre-arranged with the riad to have someone pick us up at the airport and although our plane was late they were there with a sign displaying our names. The cab took us to the edge of the medina and we walked to the riad the rest of the way - about 5 minutes. We rang the bell and Benoit me us at the door with a big welcome. We paid the driver 200dh and a tip and we walked into the beautiful calm of his home. He welcomed us with tea and insisted on carrying our luggage the three flights of stairs to the terrace room. The room was just as described on the web site and there were no surprises. The terrace provided a view of the roof tops around, but provided a view of a beautiful sunset. Breakfast was provided on the terrace the next morning and was one of…"
 October 2012,4,Beautiful Riad,"The Riad is in the busy Medina. We walked from the train station with our luggage, about 5 mins. Very convenience. Not too difficult to find since it is just one straight road from the gate. However, there is no hotel sign at the turn off, so you really have to watch out for the street road sign on the wall. We missed it and a kind local man brought us there (without asking for money. wow Rabat impressed me!). The riad is beautiful. It is bright and has a Mediterranean feel to it. Love the bright and clean terrace. Our room was beautiful and comfortable although the bath room area is a little small (with a curtain seperating it from the rest of the room). Wifi is available at all rooms, a plus. We left very early the next day so we didn't have the breakfast. The owner…"
 August 2012,4,Very good Riad in the quiet Medina of Rabat,"We booked one night at this Riad in the Terrace Room at the end of August. We booked the room via the Riad Website, and we got answers right away. We were really happy about our stay in this modern Riad, nicely decorated. And overall really happy about our day spent in Rabat. Regarding the good points, I would mention the below: - The Riad is well managed, we didn't meet Benoit but his mother, who is really nice and kind. - Breakfast taken on the Terrace was pretty good, and very nice as It is still really cool in the Morning in Rabat during Summer. Special mention for the home made Yoghurt, I really enjoyed It. - The Riad, although modern, is nicely decorated. - The bathroom is really nice, what you see on the pictures on their website is what you get. - Location was really…"
 June 2012,4,Excellent choice in Rabat,"There is much to praise about this riad. Benoit is a very accommodating and helpful host, and the location is excellent, inside the medina and within walking distance of the Rabat Ville train station. Other reviewers have mentioned most of the amenities. Many pro's: pleasant rooftop setting for breakfasts, separate ""living room"" available to guests, bottled water is provided, flexible breakfast hours, host lives on site, host lent his computer for us to e-mail home and provided an extra sheet when we asked, exceptionally delicious and ample breakfast including cooked-to-order pancakes/bread and excellent coffee served in a carafe (see photo). A few con's: no door to bathroom, no handrail on narrow stairs to room and rooftop (could be problematic for people unsure of their…"
 April 2012,5,Gorgeous Riad amazing breakfast,"This is a lovely Riad. We only stayed for one night en route to Fez,but really wish we had stayed longer. We arrived late afternoon and were greeted by Benoit who laid on mint tea and some lovely Moroccan treats. Aware that time was limited, Benoit directed us to the Kasbah and onto an excellent restaurant by the train station. In the morning we were given the best breakfast we have had in Morocco. It is in a really convenient location in the medina but in walking distance to the train station. The riad itself is stunning. We really appreciated the efforts Benoit went to to make our short stay so enjoyable."
 April 2012,5,Very nice place run by a French family,"Benoit, the owner is really very helpful and accommodating, please use his restaurant tips!"
 March 2012,5,A beautifull Riad in the centre of the medina!,Thank you Benoit for a wonderfull stay at your beautifull Riad! We had a great honeymoon and hope to come back soon! The room was magnificent and the breakfast delicious!!!
 December 2011,5,Absolutely Fantastic,"I really love this Riad, I think is the best we,ve been in Morocco, specially thinking about the prize. Located just a few bloks inside the medina, was really easy to get there walking from the train station. We stayed in the Zerka room, and although had just a very small windows, there was really beautifully decorated in a modern style, warming, and good place for sleeping. The only ""special"" thing avout the room is that the bathroom in separated from the room just by a courtain, which means you have no much privacy there, but fou couples this shouldn´t be a problem. The breakfast was absolutely superb, giant and delicious, served at the beautiful terrace in the top of the Riad. During the evenings they turn on the fireplace in the living room ant the first floor and you can…"
 January 2012,5,would like to stay a month!,"dar soufa is a beautifully decorated and really pleasant riad, has a nice terrace and a relaxing salon maroccain with chimney this location is great to visit the ancient medina and rabat kasbah, and really convenient if you're travelling by train rooms are comfortable and clean, breakfast is rich and the owner is friendly and helpful enjoy your sejour!"
 October 2011,5,Great riad at the heart of the medina,"We stayed at this riad for one night, on our way to Meknes and Fes. The service was great. We received by email all the directions to get there and a map ahead of time, otherwise, it may be a little bit hard to find the riad. I agree with the others that the breakfast on the rooftop terrace was great. It is also located within walking distance to the Kasbah Oudaias, which is definitely worth a visit."
 September 2011,5,Very cool place to stay - Most amazing breakfast in Morocco,"My boyfriend and I biked from down the coast of Morocco and stayed in various cities. This was one of our favorite places. It's down a totally quiet side street in the heart of the medina, but the inside is gorgeous. Remodelled very tastefully. The rooms are large, quiet and cool. There is a nice roof terrace. But the best part of our stay was the breakfast. Coffee, tea, dates, yogurt, bread, cheese, fresh fruit. A nice change from bread and butter. The host was super friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place."
 February 2011,5,"Wonderful, friendly service. Would return in an instant.","Located in the Rabat medina, essentially a walk in a straight line from the train station, the riad is in an ideal spot for exploring what Rabat has to offer. The markets on the way to the riad continue until around 11pm, with everything you may (or may not!) want to buy, food, clothing, luggage, trinkets, music etc As is the case with other riads, it offers a haven of peace & was spotlessly clean. Benoit, the owner, was the friendliest of hosts we met & full of advice, local information & general chit-chat, which made our stay so pleasant. He upgraded us to the terrace room, at no extra cost, due to cancellation & provided the best breakfast we ate in Morocco - by far. Very comfortable bed & a wonderful shower also. A trip back to Rabat would definitely mean a trip to this…"
 October 2010,5,"beautiful riad, great location","riad dar soufa was our first riad in morocco and after having seen different riads, it was definitely the most stylish one we stayed at...and offers the best breakfast;) the location is great (very easy access to the medina, near to the main train station, eay to find) a great place to stay at in rabat!"
 February 2010,3,Great location in the Rabat Medina,"We stayed in this riad just for 1 night, during our honeymoon in Morocco. It is owned by a French couple and it seems that most of the travellers staying there also come from France as owners speak only limited English. The key positive is location: just off rue Mohammed V, at the entrance to Rabat's Medina. This riad is easily accessible from the train station and is close to all major tourist attractions in Rabat. The riad itself was ok but not wow. Owners were helpful and friendly but our stay there was not memorable. Room was stuffy and not very clean, the bathroom section was separated by just a curtain, and we missed the little touches that make for a nice stay, like having a hairdrayer or a comfortable chair to sit on. Overall I would recommend this place if you…"
 February 2010,5,Perfect enough to make my in lores happy!,"This boutique accommodation is perfectly located in the Medina: easy to find, easy to leave to wander and get lost in the traditional Moroccan way of life. The quality of the restauration shows certainly an attention to details, but more than that, love for the traditional craft, without overdoing it. There are many riads and hotels overflowing with zellij, exotism and fluffy cushions. This one is just about the necessary, a refined balance and care for the senses: the beautiful, the natural and the authentic. I was there at the occasion of a business trip, accompanied with wife and baby, who also loved the place. It's a pity this Dar has only four rooms (make sure to book!) yet, size is its charm. Note: the staff has a kind of joyful madness that adds to the experience."
 May 2009,5,hidden gem in Rabat medina,"We stayed at Dar Soufa during both our visits to Rabat (2 and 3 nights). The riad is very tastefully designed--minimalist modern with the perfect blend of traditional Moroccan detail. We stayed in Chambre Zerka and really enjoyed it--high ceilings, large comfortable bed and very clean. One note: the bathroom in this unit is not a separate room but simply separate from the rest of the room by a privacy screen--the setup worked for us but may not work for all. Benoit, the owner, is a friendly and unobtrusive host with good advice on the city. Big, hearty breakfast. Very convenient location--3 blocks or so into the medina when coming from the nouvelle ville, about 10-15 minutes walk to the train station. Great rates. Highly recommended."
 April 2009,5,Great 'ambiente',We went to see our daughter who lives in Rabat and we spent five days in this beautifully decorated riad. It's recently opened and the decoration is just charming and pure Maroccan style. Benoît the owner is a perfect host and eager to make your stay pleasant and comfortable. We really enjoyed these days and would always return in case we're in Rabat.
