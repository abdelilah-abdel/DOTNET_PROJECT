 October 2022,5,One of the coziest places we've stayed in Morocco!,"We really enjoyed our stay in the riad! The owners were super friendly and helpful with our plans, the room was nice and cozy and we ate there for dinner one of the best tajines we've ate throughout our trip. Would highly recommend staying there :)"
 August 2022,5,Beautiful Riad with very comfortable amenities and great service! Hakim made us feel very welcome.,"The riad was easy to find and provided everything we needed. The room was gorgeous and my family slept comfortably, Thanks to Hakim and staff making extra arrangements. The grounds were very accommodating and breakfast was delicious. Thank you for an amazing visit!!"
 May 2022,5,Great riad experience.,"We travel as a husband and wife and two widows. We travelled all over the world as 3 couples,but unfortunately two husbands have died. We loved this riad. Very distinctive, rooms very decorated, and well equipped. Not many rooms. Staff very attentive, food adequate, but not haute cuisine, but a proper riad experience. We loved it"
 September 2019,3,Beautiful riad but a terrible nights sleep,"The staff were lovely & very helpful, Manilla in particular she was wonderful. Menu limited to one dish though but it was a lovely chicken tagine. The surroundings and entrance are stunning. The shower in our room was also excellent. Let down unfortunately by the location, opposite a couple of schools which can make it noisy, and not near anything, set back from the centre. Also the bed in room 9 was so hard it was honestly like sleeping on the floor. I woke at 4am and couldn't get comfortable to sleep again. It was a long drive back to Marakesh the next day for us & my back was hurting badly. Some great points here but shadowed by lack of sleep and a pained next day."
 June 2019,4,Unexpectedly 'exotic' in a quiet residential street...,"A very beautiful building, tiled throughout in ancient Moroccan style. The building is tall and thin, so there are a lot of stairs - with a private open patio at the top. Good welcome, and delicious breakfast in a comfy and luxurious 'salon'. Attractive pool as part of the building. It was the hottest time, and for the 4 of us, the air conditioning could be a little more powerful. A week later we tried to book a return visit, but it is clearly very popular, and was fully booked."
 March 2019,3,Mixed impression,"This riad is conveniently located close to the airport, but a litlle far from the downtown area where are most restaurants. Unfortunalely, it is also probably very close to a mosque: around 6 AM, you almost feel the morning prayer's loudspeaker is in your room! On a positive note, the staff is courteous and efficient. Our room was clean and well-appointed and decorated with nice morrocan features."
 September 2018,5,"Wonderful place, wonderful hosts!","We arrived later than planned, was already dark and rainy, the hotel is easy to find, they waited for us with a warm soup, the room was big and full of nice details, excellent breakfast! They were very very friendly, helping us till the last minute! Thank you so much! David & Kasia"
 September 2018,5,very nice and confortable place,The access is very well signed so very easy to find. A very welcoming hotel. Hassan and the ladies are ever so friendly . The rooms are huge and very confortable . It is a new place but you feel you are staying in an old riad.
 June 2018,5,Nice riad,"Just stay one night when on the way from Marrakech to the desert. It’s quiet, clean, and had harmony of modern and traditional culture. Hassan is very friendly and let us feel a comfortable staying on the trip. Btw, the beef tagine is highly recommended."
 December 2017,5,Perfect hospitality,"Wonderful riad, very traditional place! The room was huge and very clean. Khaki was absolutely friendly and helpful, I'm happy that i have one new friend like him! The dinner was delicious, you should eat the vegetable soup and tajine kiofte! I felt like my home! I missed already this place and people there ..."
 December 2017,5,Best staff ever,"We visited Riad Ouarzazate when doing some work at the Masen Noor solar complex in Ouarzazate. The owner of Riad Ouarzazate is one of the most service minded and helpful people I’ve met. He helped us a lot and made the stay a success. The dining room and the room were very beautiful Moroccan style, the beads are good and it’s a short walk to the city centre. If you are looking for a genuine Moroccan place and genuine people I really recommend this place!"
 September 2017,5,Lovely welcoming riad,This is a small beautiful riad - every room and hallway is covered with beautiful tile and woodwork. The food is wonderful and the staff is welcoming and helpful. Our room was lovely and the bed was comfortable. Highly recommended!
 May 2017,5,Nice place,"It s our First time in riad ourzazate we love it so much freindlly sttaf , so helpful clean place and so confortbal We love bcs it s sooooooo traditional Close to the airport and a lovely location I would recommend visite the riad for all"
 June 2015,5,Just gorgeous,A really lovely experience - breakfast was delicious and the bed was very comfortable. the staff were also very friendly. Not a five star hotel but sould have been - I felt like a Queen there - very special
 September 2015,5,A little gem,"Good location for the airport, not far from the centre, and in a nice clean location with some shops and little cafes where you could get coffee and pastries. This is by far the best place we stayed in Ouarzazate, the staff provided free transfers to and from the airport, but if you don’t have that, you can do the airport trip for just 5 euro in a taxi. Staff were polite and catered to all our needs, rooms were clean and equipped everything worked as it should. We would stay again."
 April 2015,5,will be back,amazing staff - went out of there way for us we visited 3 times in 1 month. we will return and we recommend this place for everyone the front of house gentleman was very friendly.. the breakfast was basic and did the job.
 November 2014,5,Very friendly service.,Nice little Riad. The staff was very friendly and the food was pretty good as well. The only thing I will say is that if you are on foot then it is a little far removed from the down town. It is probably about a 1 mile walk to the main square. The rooftop has some nice views over the town. I would recommend this place.
 April 2015,5,What an awesome place,"Stayed here with my wife for 2 nights visiting ouarzazette the ambiance was great it was quiet and not on the main road but tucked away on a side street I felt welcomed straight away when the gentleman who runs the front of house offered us tea and biscuits and let us view our room, we chose to eat twice there and the food was also amazing he cooked us what we requested one night tajine the second couscous and both came with starters and deserts for 120dh each which was an acceptable price to pay. I asked the front of house manager if he could arrange some dates from around the ouarzazette region within 2 hours he got me a box which came from zagora he also assisted me with where to go on daytimes and what to see which was also great. I do not have one negative thing to say…"
 October 2014,5,Beautiful little hotel with friendly staff!,The rooms and entrance areas had some beautiful mosaics and artistry. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Breakfast and dinner was good. There isn't much around the hotel but we got our driver to take us out to the mini-souks area.
 October 2014,5,Holiday,"Well recommended. Decor outside & inside are Traditional morrocan, very warm. The staff are very friendly & most helpful. Definitely come back here again. It is very clean & the food in their restaurant are delicious. It is very clean place & so relaxing. It is not far from the main town centre."
 April 2014,5,Great hospitality,"The riad is relatively new, close to the airport, so not in the center. It took the owner 10 years to built it, piece by piece, yet it doesn't ""feel"" new. The rooms were just ok, I did not love it, but the main area, the doors, and stones are very beautiful. service was simply great. friendly, accommodating staff. It is a great place for an overnight if you need to be close to the airport. We ended up not taking the flight, as Royal Air Maroc overbooked the flight, and we were pretty much stuck. But then, Chamoda, from the riad, helped us tremendously: Picking us up from the airport--after we checked out, back to the riad--and arranging a driver for us going to Fes, all of which done with genuine care. So overall, I feel very lucky we stayed there."
 May 2014,5,"Tasteful decor, friendly & wonderful staff.","Was a delight to stay here. Sorry we only had one night as the rooms were lovely, the food excellent and staff just lovely & really helpful. I would love to go back as our stay here was memorable. The decor was modern but traditional and very tasteful."
 April 2014,4,"Lovely and quiet, great place to stay","Located in a residential area, away from the city centre provided a very quiet secure environment. The entrance was absolutely stunning, beautiful tiling, ornate wooden doors, carpets, embroidered cushions, delightful. Our room was large, plenty of hot water and pressure however one flooded the bathroom floor when showering. Large window, so we didn't use the air conditioner. The food was very nice, a three course set meal each night, breakfast was impressive, really liked how local ceramics were used and the condiments all served in small tagines. Dealt all the time with one staff member, he was very helpful organised a taxi to Zagora and a plug for Ipad."
 March 2014,5,"A lovely, colourful place to stay","The rooms was large and well appointed, very comfortable with large double bed. We even had a large balcony overlooking the street. The decor was a delight to behold - most unusual. The staff were wonderful and so willing to help in any way they could. We enjoyed our stay immensely. Great breakfasts - sort of continental with a Moroccan twist. The downside was the location - you need to have a car - we found it difficult to navigate our way back after dark."
 January 2014,5,Simply excellent,"This riad is simply excellent. The design is wonderful, the hotel is clean, the staff is very nice and helpful and the breakfast is what you would expect from a morroccan breakfast - a lot of good food. Ouarzazate itself is a pretty town - clean strets, brick-colored buildings and friendly people on the edge of the desert."
 December 2013,5,excellent service,"Very nice, clean accommodation. Traditional Moroccan style rooms, beautifully maintained, impressive place to stay. When the hotel called to ask if they could help us find the accommodation it was a relief after driving around Ouarzazate for 30 min as we forgot the address, Hamouda came to meet us, big thank you! Food was good too......hope to see you again next time. Jane and Philippe"
 November 2013,5,"Amazing place, small, spotless, amazing.","I have been to Ouarzazate many times, this is the first time in the Riad Ourzazate. I am so happy. great rooms, flat screen tv, brand new, spotless, wonderful food, among the best tagine I've have in Morocco and with 53 trips under my belt here, that is saying a lot! Owner arranged trip into the desert in Mhamid, had a blast on camels and camping in the dunes. This hotel is in quiet residential neighborhood, only a block from the airport if you have early morning or late arriving flight. Highly recommend for anyone alone or family or small group. Much better than one of the big hotels with poor service and busloads of tourists."
 October 2013,4,Found by chance,"This place is a gem.Faultless. we only found it by their sign on the side of the road! Hamouda welcomed us with tea and biscuits and gave us a lot of info about Ouazazarte and the the trip to Tenehir. i cannot rate this place highly enough. The room, dinner and breakfast were great."
 October 2013,4,"Clean rooms, friendly staff","We had a nice stay in Ouarzazate. The staff was very helpfull and kind. Clean rooms. Breakfast was included and it was quite good. You can park your car in front of the Riad. The only thing that wasn't that great was Wifi. It didn't work in our room. Overall, we had a really good stay in Riad Ouarzazate."
 May 2013,4,Quiet & beautiful retreat.....,"This riad is in a new residential area of the city - very quiet. The riad itself is beautiful - traditional Moroccan-style using design elements and techniques found in historic residences. The public areas are welcoming and comfortable for relaxing, enjoying mint tea or snuggling up with a book - especially the terrace. The rooms are wonderfully comfortable - large, great beds. lovely linens, good lighting, even closets. Ours had a balcony overlooking the front patio - perfect spot to enjoy something cool. The bathroom was beautifully tiled, large, clean, well appointed with a double sized shower - heavenly! Enjoyed a delicious traditional Moroccan dinner and breakfast at the riad - shared our dinner table with Austrian riad guests. We agreed that the quality of service,…"
 March 2013,5,Excellent service,Fantastic shower! Best so far in Morocco. The guy who looked after us was cool. Friendly and spoke English. Recommended us a couple if nice restaurants and took us there so we knew where we were going and could make an informed choice. The restaurant we chose Kasbah des Sables was stunning. Only ended up here on the off chance as it is not in the Rough Guide book and we went to the Le Petit Riad first but it was full - they recommended this place. No pool but beautiful decor and interior. Offered to make us food if we wanted. Breakfast included and asked us when we wanted it. The only down side was there were bare wires in our room where the tv should be and the roof terrace was nice and authentic Berber with lots of rugs and comfy sofas but no loungers to lie in the sun. On the…
 January 2013,5,"After the desert, a paradise !","This Riad has a very morocco traditional style, with high level services; The room was large and very cosy, very comfortable bed, bathroom has a very large shower. After two days in the desert was a real treat !! breakfast and dinner were excellent. ideal for a stop to/from the desert."
 January 2013,5,Excellent riad!,"We stayed there for 2 nights before and after going to the desert. The riad is beautifully decorated, with intricate details and warm colors. The rooms are spacious, beds very comfortable, the bathrooms charming and overall very clean. We also had dinner both nights and the food was excellent! All in all an unforgettable experience - highly recommend it. And the owner Mohamed is your best guide to the desert!"
 April 2011,5,Exotic and refreshing,"We stayed one day at this hotel on our way to the Sahara. It was very exotic and romantic and sooo confortable after a long trip. Bid beds, luxurious and great gardens with swimming pool replicating an oasis where we spend all day swimming. After the relaxin day we could continue our trip. Food was also good. Don,t miss this hotel if you are south Morocco."
 November 2011,5,"Beautiful Riad, excellent service","This is a beautiful Riad. Our room had a balcony, and of course you have access to the beautiful rooftop area. The food was delicious, and the staff very helpful and courteous. Our room came with breakfast and dinner included, and it was prepared and served magnificently. I wish I could have stayed longer, this place is highly recommended, in my mind."
