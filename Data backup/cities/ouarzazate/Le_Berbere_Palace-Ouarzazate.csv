 November 2022,4,Very good hotel,"We spent two nights here at this most luxurious accommodation on our OAT tour of Morocco on our way out of the desert.

Furnishings included a large bed with side tables, closet with ten hangers and safe, long table at the end of the bed which we used for one suitcase; a luggage rack; and chair. The large bathroom had a glassed-in shower with wand and rain showers, single sink, robes, one pair of slippers, soap, shampoo and conditioner.

 November 2022,5,Great service and room,We stayed 2 nights. The service was excellent and we felt welcome. Our room was a suite and lovely. The bathroom is beautiful as well. We ate our meals here and enjoyed breakfast and the Moroccan cuisine as well as pasta bolognese at the Italian restaurant. Snacks at the pool with a Casablanca beer is a must.
 November 2022,4,Lovely hotel.,"This hotel was lovely. The rooms were spacious and beautiful. The service was great. The hotel was very quiet when I was there. The dinner menu was not Moroccan, but I had an amazing pizza. The wine list looked decent, but only one red wine was available and it was not good."
 November 2022,5,Highly recommend,"We just left the Berbere Palace. My husband and I rate it highly. The manager, Azdine, made sure everything was going smoothly for us. The staff was extremely experienced and friendly. We had the best nights sleep in a week there."
 October 2022,1,Disappointing and sad,The hotel is nice on the inside and the newly renovated rooms are good. Staff are sweet and gentle. The one disappointing fact is the management. First of all the hotel doesn’t have a resident manager. When one did show up for a few days he made promises he didn’t keep. The cleaning of the rooms isn’t amazing. I would swat flying insects on the wall leaving bloody marks and he or she strangely would not notice them. When I complained to maintenance about some issues half the time they were not fixed and I’d have to call again. Otherwise the food and beverages staff are lovely. Would I go back? Probably note. Too expensive and not enough value. The expensive drinks and food only add insult to injury
 May 2022,4,Nice property but could use a few adjustments.,"Very large property and rooms. It is a very pretty place. The landscaping is lovely.Food is OK…nothing great. Probably the nicest hotel by far in the area. The bathroom is huge with a rain shower and a handheld shower head. There is a large soaking tub and we had two sinks. We were not sure what good clear glass enclosing the commode area did. If you are going to enclose it, you would use something else so you weren't visible to whomever was in the bathroom or you wouldn't bother enclosing it.. There were 4 large bottles of water in the room which was nice.

 April 2022,3,Mixed feelings,"I agree with the reviewer who said that this is ""a comfortable hotel with issues"" because it certainly is that.

But, as the other reviewer said, it smelled like sewage. And, whoever designed the bathroom should have thought to put frosted glass on the commode enclosure because, otherwise, you're totally exposed to whoever else might want to use the spacious room.

 March 2022,3,Comfortable hotel with issues!,"Rooms - Recently refurbished and comfortable. The bathrooms have an unfortunate sewage smell as the drains do not have traps. Food - Average and overpriced. No menus in the rooms but a wide selection of choices, when you manage to find one. Nothing was particularly good. The food is overpriced but the drinks are insanely expensive. Service - Waiting and kitchen staff are very helpful and friendly, if somewhat unreliable. The reception staff clearly would prefer you not to be there. Consistently make you feel like an irritant. Internet - Very good when it works. But it often doesn't. Summary - This is a 5 star hotel on paper but the service, amenities and cost of sundries are far from 5 star. You will not get good value here."
 April 2022,2,Disappointed,"Very average hotel, not nearly as good as advertised. Huge wait for the pool bar, drinks very expensive €9 a bottle of beer. Staff and management could not cope at all with circa 250 Marathon Des Sables guests."
 April 2022,1,Ms,"This is quite possibly the worst 5* hotel I have ever stayed in. Management is utterly dismissive of their guests, food is extremely overpriced and way below average standards, drinks are a total rip off. Went to their “Asian” inspired restaurant and got served microwaved duck in what they said was hoisin sauce (it wasn’t) with pancakes (which just didn’t come) and spaghetti masquerading as noodles on the side. Their Italian restaurant is bland and pretty much everything tastes the same, pizza was ok but who wants to live on average pizza for 6 weeks when working in the area……not me! Bedroom cleanliness was below average, there is still a spill mark on my floor that has been there for 4 weeks. They need to invest in hoovers if they want to have rugs in the room as mine is…"
 April 2022,4,Nice and contemporary hotel.,"Hotel has a very large and comfortable rooms and bathrooms. Excellent service. Excellent restaurant. Thank you to Moubarak, he took a good care of us at dinner and breakfast. Unfortunately rooms 218 and 220 where we stayed with our friends had a very strong smell from toilets."
 September 2021,5,lovely hotel with lots of movie items throughout!!!,We stayed along with a tour group for two nights at this resort and found it wonderful. The hotel has had many actors stay at it do to its location near the Moroccan studios. It was fun to see the props and actually sit on them for a cool photo op. The rooms were spacious (ours was #536) and the staff promptly serviced the rooms. The food is also very good (although the Italian not their strength) and the pool were enjoyable. Would definitely recommend to others.
 November 2021,3,Not sure why solo trip matters but large room TERRIBLE service,"Large relatively clean room. The worst hotel service. Spa, reception, restaurant service all absolutely non existent. And construction all day long. I recognize this is the nicest hotel in the area but do not expect much. Also trip advisor please stop asking to us to classify our stay. It absolutely doesn’t matter if it’s one or two or five people staying for work or pleasure."
 November 2021,5,Top palace great experience of true moroccan hospitality values,"Excellent Servcie great historical venue I had the chance to spend few days in this magnificent hotel. The service is rated aaa+, very super friendly staff, clean comfortable rooms especially the bed , the pillows… you feel very spoiled. A real definition of a palace in the south of morocco. All the facilities are great: Italian restaurants serves real Italian tasty food while the atmosphere In exquisite, the breakfast is very diverse from moroccan food to fruits dry fruits , green juices, 🥕 juice … and more limitless choices all french made to the minute. The bar area is just a wow , having a drink at the bar makes you feel the real night time experience and grandiose style of this hotel, Hollywood style Bartenders who have been serving worldwide celebrities who have been…"
 October 2021,2,Proceed with caution,"Stayed here, at short notice, in Earl October 2021. Checked in, allocated room, and soon asked to be moved. Initial room had not been cleaned, the minibar was empty, no bottled water to be seen, the fridge wasn't plugged in, the shower leaked through the bath flooding the bathroom floor and, when I called reception, I discovered the telephone didn't work. And the price for this single occupancy room: $250 per night. Moved to a new room. Wish I hadn't bothered. Apart from the telephone working, all other issues were the same as the first room. Had to leave early in the morning after two nights. Checked three times with reception the day before that breakfast starts at 5:00am. When, on checking out, I go to the restaurant for a quick breakfast at 5:30am, it is in darkness, with…"
 September 2021,5,Loved the Movie related theme and Services of this hotel,My wife and I stayed along with a tour group for two nights at this resort and found it wonderful. The hotel has had many actors stay at it do to its location near the Moroccan studios. Loved all the props from the movies at the hotel and also the large rooms and great service. The food is also very good (although the Italian not their strength) and the service and pool also great. Would definitely recommend to others.
 September 2021,5,"Extremely beautiful hotel, great service, very nice rooms","As part of a two week trip through morocco, we stay two nights at this gorgeous hotel. The swimming pool is absolutely out of this world beautiful. The dining room is also beautifully set up with white linen service. We had dinner there one night and breakfast there two mornings. Both meals were very good. The staff is friendly and helpful. We had a sweet, and our room was gigantic. Very nice toiletries, two TVs."
 March 2021,4,Hôtel comment,"Lovely hotel Nice swimming pool , Nice place ,lovely staff! Especially mister mbark at breakfast! The director took care of us too. Thanks to berbère palace And the region ouarzazate worth the journey"
 December 2019,5,Favorite Hotel in my Morocco trip,"rooms are nicely spaced about from each other. you don't feel cluttered. the room itself is spacious and comfortable. i had one of the best night's sleep in morocco at this particular hotel. breakfast/dinner is great with a widespread of delicacies. staff are very nice and welcoming. no language barrier here. a pity i only stayed <12hrs at this hotel. PS: the only downside, depending on the location of your room, you may have to walk a little."
 August 2019,3,Overated definately not a palace,"We booked a first class trip through Morocco and this hotel was by far the most disappointing. The room looked like a Holiday Inn, old beds and mattresses, plastic curtains, just depressing all around. The food in the restaurant for dinner was bad. The quality of the food was low and our waiter was trying to teach us Arabic throughout the course of our meal. Breakfast was better but not wonderful. On the plus side, the grounds were well maintained and the pool in the main courtyard was lovely. If you are expecting a true luxury experience you will be disappointed here. We were."
 December 2019,5,Unreal 5 star hotel at last,"Traveling through Morocco, this has to be the best hotel, they told us so many American came here to shoot movies, and the whole place was decorated with movie memorabilia. Dinner was a grand buffet style, Our group was allocated in one zone, some has upper floor and we got the downstairs suite, it's even larger than our home apartment. Unfortunately, we have to leave the next morning, continuing to Marrakesh."
 December 2019,3,"Freezy rooms, the a/c very old and smelly",The hotel is very nice and impressive but the rooms are very cold. We arrived in the afternoon and when we entered the room it was as cold as outside of it. I called the reception because the a/c was not working and they came after 40 minutes. The employee took out the filters of the a/c and it was grey and covered with dust! In a palace (as they named it) the customer expects at least that the room will be warm when he arrives at the room in winter season. It was a big disappointment!
 November 2019,5,"5 star hotel in centre of the ""movie"" town.",This hotel is a large comfortable tourist hotel in the centre of the town that is often used as a movie location. The hotel is comfortable. We were there for just one night so had no real opportunity to try out all the amenties. It has free wifi.
 December 2019,5,Excellent hotel in Ouarzazate,"We stayed there yesterday. It is a 5 star hotel in international standard. House-style room is the feature. We took some minutes to walk from the reception to our house. Inside it is spacious with sofa, sitting room, nice toilet. It provides both kettle and cafe machine inside the room. Though everything is good, the direction/road sign is not clear nor adequate. It is easy to lost direction, especially for those ones who are the first time to visit. Foods at restaurant (Oasis) are good with a lot choices. Waiters are ok."
 November 2019,5,A fabulous place to stay,"We were in a Trek with a group of 30 other people for 5 days/nights in the Sahara Desert. We stayed here both the day before we started and the day we ended. Location is about 1/2 way between the desert (at least where we started our hike) and Marrakech. This was truly a lovely hotel. Very organized in check in and out. Staff were delightful and helpful. Rooms were spacious, clean and well laid out. The buffet in the restaurant was generous and fresh. If you’re coming through this way, by al means stop off. It’s definitely a great choice."
 September 2019,5,Desert Oasis,"This hotel was a real treat following a long, hot day of touring. Our room had all the comfortable amenities that you would expect from a five star hotel. Comfortable bed, luxury towels, bathrobe, WiFi, satellite tv and an extra sitting room made for a relaxing evening. There is an outdoor swimming pool and spa if you have the time. We had no complaints regards the buffet breakfast and dinner. This hotel provides an oasis for the weary traveler."
 October 2019,5,wonderful hotel,"The service and room were top notch. Had dinner at the hotel and wait staff was friendly, accommodating, and recommended the best red wine we ever had. Our head waiter, Moubarak, was kind and courteous. He smiled and laughed with us throughout the entire meal. Our party felt at ease despite a small language barrier lol Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again on a return trip to Morocco."
 November 2019,5,2019 Morocco Le Berbere palace,This is a very nice hotel. A first visit to the town. Much history. The Medina old town is very nicely different from what I expected. The hotel has a nice restaurant. Our room was a king size bed requested but it appeared to be somewhat smaller. The staff was good and very attentive.
 October 2019,5,A beautiful hotel where staging used in actual movies are still around,"Since Atlas studios are close by, the hotel has actual staff used in movies. This gives a particular ambience to the hotel. Since we were travelling with a group, on arrival the staff unloaded all our luggage and then to the rooms. The rooms are laid out in a vast area. Actually we had to walk a fair distance to find our room. We were lucky to be given a suite i suspect (room 546) which was huge. The shower separately from the toilet!! Dinner was very good. The buffet had such a great variety for all sorts of palates. Unfortunately we on;y stayed for one night so we hardly had tome to enjoy the facilities,"
 October 2019,3,"Nice hotel,but overwhelmed by tours","Amain stop for tour companies. Staff is clearly overtaken by so many arrivals and departures at once. As a result they seem to be streßed an unpleasant. Buffet dinner and breakfast are also a madhouse with food running out. At breakfast, some tourists must think that they will run out of food during the day. Food, ham, cheese and fruit are all packed away to take with them . As a result ...good luck getting something for your breakfast."
 October 2019,5,Great Place,Le Berbére Palace was a great place to stay in Ouarzazate. It had a beautiful courtyard with a pool and some interesting props from some of the movies that have been filmed in Ouarzazate. The dinner in the hotel was a buffet with a good selection of foods all well prepared. Breakfast was excellent as well.
 October 2019,3,Past its prime and needs updating,"When new and serving the movie industry this property was likely outstanding but unfortunately the owners have elected not invest in the future. The design and layout are excellent and the room large there is a serious need for a major refreshing project Particularly noticeable was the deep and extremely slippery tub which was chipped with moldy grout and a leaking faucet. Tile around the bathroom was also chipped and missing grout. The room furniture provided plenty of storage and a nice desk but has seen better days with far too many dings and dents. However what we found most disturbing was the internet service. While strong signals were evident both in the room and common areas, they lack network capacity and many times we could not connect during our two day stay. While…"
 October 2019,5,Impressive🌟,Luxury & Lush! The movie props were interesting & the staff most helpful. 🌞 We were pleased with this beautiful property! All meals were extraordinary and we will recommend this resort in the future:)
 September 2019,5,An oasis in the desert...,"Wow! Awesome, spacious room with king-sized bed... (once you manage the precarious spiral staircase!) Luxurious bedding, fluffy towels...you feel so pampered... Great bathroom...(separation of toilet & shower)... Wonderful pool... Good dinner and breakfast buffets...extra charge for water... Great service...highly recommendable hotel..."
 October 2019,5,"no complaints, good hotel.","Very nice hotel. Comfortable big rooms and bed, good toiletries, good pool, good porters, no complaints. Good breakfast. Would recommend this to people seeking a bit of luxury. Fed some food to their poolside cats as well."
 October 2019,3,"Beautiful but missing the basics- service, shower that works, front desk that picks up!","After staying in 5 hotels across Morocco, most of our group rated this beautiful property the lowest in follow through: what came after the lobby, that is. Walk into the large buffet room and you will feel like you are one of hundreds of guests. Need a bottle of water -no way. Serve yourself from the large pitcher and who knows where that comes from. Coffee is get it yourself- across the room. No shower head in the neighboring room and no one to answer at the desk- so we shared our shower. Beautifull property with ""casitas"" as they are known elsewhere. Lovely plants too. Poor quality food and food service. No directions to your room- a property map would be an easy fix. Wish they would improve."
 October 2019,5,WAITER SERVICE,"earlier in the day had room service, very quick, later in the evening had dinner and the waiter was the same person who delivered room service earlier in day. the server was Mbark ( hope I spelled correctly) efficient friendly and far exceeded what a wait staff member usually is, made my stay very memorable"
 September 2019,4,Fantastic Hotel and grounds,"I spent 4 nights at the Berbere Palace and I only have one complaint. How to get there: Le Berbere Palace is about 5mn drive from the airport and you can get a beige Taxi for 50 or 60 Dirhams(about £5). As we arrived early to the hotel, we were allowed to check in earlier as expected and had breakfast which costs us 200dh PP(£17) The breakfast is good if you are a big eater and not vegan as your options are so limited. The room was spacious and clean as expected from a 5 Stars Hotel but due to the high temperatures, you might get a nasty smell coming out of the toilet which I have raised with the cleaners. This is no ones fault but as it is the dry season, not much water goes down the external drains. Sufficient Hot water and clean towels changed daily. You get given a…"
 September 2019,5,Fabulous Relaxation Spot,"We walked around town in the morning - including the Kasbah tour, then sat by the pool in the afternoon with a few beers, and enjoyed a lovely Italian meal with wine for dinner. This town is the Hollywood of Morocco - ask a local which movies they have been in!"
 August 2019,5,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for a night. The room was big and spacious, the breakfast buffet was great and there were a lot of dinner choices. The only major issue was that the rooms can be very far from the main building (and from the restaurants) without any way of sheltering yourself from the rain. Perhaps adding a couple of umbrellas to each room would be a nice touch for those bad rainy days."
 June 2019,3,"Large, well landscaped, quiet, but somewhat worn","Great staff, friendly and helpful. Rooms comfortable and quiet. A large hotel, nicely landscaped. Courtyard has a large pool, and a bar. The breakfast buffet was gigantic. Fresh and canned fruit. Great orange juice, and other juices. Salmon, bacon, sausage. Breads and pastries. Yogurt and granola. Eggs and omelets. The dinner buffet was even more gigantic, but was not very good. Pork, beef, lamb, fish. Vegetables, breads and salads. The place is somewhat worn: toilet seat loose, tub slow to drain, air conditioner rattles irregularly, door hardware loose, room safe was not working."
 May 2019,4,Nice hotel,"Most rooms seem to be ground floor, so its a walk back to the restaurant or reception. Rooms are a reasonable size and very quiet. Meals were fine and the breakfast buffet was very enjoyable. Would happily stay here again."
 May 2019,4,After a few days in a desert tent this is more than just an oasis,"The sign in and atmosphere are prompte and pleasing. The decor boasts of the many hollywood associated movie events for which this city is known. The rooms spacious, better lit than most and the bathroom facilities more than ample. Yes it is clean. The restaurant is large and many items on the breakfast and lunch buffet are are delicious. Fruits great, breads just fine, fish great, and many choices. On the other hand cold eggs (fried - not hard boiled, and strange bacon and sausage were a bit off putting. Bar service at the pool fair but complete."
 May 2019,3,Would not be my first choice hotel,"Having arrived late to Ouarzazate, we took a room for one night at the Berbere Palace. As we were on motorbikes and full riding gear, we did not receive the warmest of welcomes. In fact, while doing the check-in, they took care of several other customers in flip flops and casual clothing and made us wait. Same goes for the check-out. The receptionist does not hesitate to pick up his cell phone and start a discussion while you wait to pay your bill. When enquiring about food options, we were told dinner costs 300 MAD per person. I don't know where they got that figure but we had a good dish of pasta at the pool restaurant for 100 MAD each, plus drinks. The hotel is a tad expensive but the setting is nice. The staff at the pool bar and the restaurant are nice and service is…"
 May 2019,4,Nice Property,"While visiting Ouarzazate, we spent one night in the Le Berber Palace. The property is very nice. The lobby area has setting from a variety of movies. That was unique and pleasant. Our room was away from the main building and on the second floor. Climbing the steps with our carry on luggage was not an easy task since the hallway up to our room was narrow and a bit dark. The room was a suite with two bedrooms and a nice sitting area. A refrigerator, wifi, wall safe and coffee with a pot to heat the water were all provided. Our stay was very enjoyable except for the ants in the room. We called about the ants and a lady came, looked and left. We never say her again and the ant problem continued. The bed was comfortable. We left the next day."
 April 2019,5,Elegant Hotel,Good location. Very nice interior. Clean and quiet rooms. Lots of sitting areas throughout the property. Very nice pool. Beautiful grounds. High end service. Huge food choice. Grand lobby. The shops across the street should be avoided. They scam tourists regularly. If this review is helpful then please indicate so below.
 September 2018,4,Pleasant hotel for tour groups and movie makers,"We enjoyed 2 nights here with our tour group. The grounds have good ambiance, the room was excellent and the evenings were quiet. The swimming pool area is well designed for relaxation with the spa in the corner. My wife had a massage which was an average experience and could be improved for a hotel of this standard. The buffet breakfast and dinner were consistently good both days. Service was OK. There are some tourist shops across the street where we bought a couple of items."
 May 2019,2,The grounds and pool area was lovely and the room was comfortable but food was disappointing.,We stayed here because where our group was supposed to stay in another town was not available at the last minute. When we arrived we were given our keys and pointed in the right direction. The room number signs stopped half way there and all of our group could not initially find their rooms. The grounds are a bit of a maze. The rooms were nice enough although we could not get our TV to work even when we called for help. It worked for about 5 minutes then the controls did not work again after the tecnician came. Not a big deal since there is not much to watch but what was a big deal especially while staying at a hotel on this level was the food. For both dinner and breakfast in the large buffet restaurant is probably the worst hotel food I have ever had and I have been to…
 April 2019,3,Group travel location,"This large establishment is probably fine for travel groups but will not suit the individual traveller; we were overwhelmed by the masses and the waiting time at the reception, underwhelmed by the very ordinary food, unimpressed by the service and very annoyed by the unfriendly management (which is probably the reason for the poor service: I can’t imagine that any staff would like working under such unpleasant management). The beds and rooms were fine but the bathrooms are really in need of an overhaul; our shower didn’t work and we couldn’t find anyone to fix it. On the positive side, the pool is lovely and large and the WiFi seemed to work."
 April 2019,4,Varied Buffet with Lots of Choices,"Beautiful ambiance with lots of flowers and trees, which provided a relaxing atmosphere. Large buffet -- I tried both breakfast and dinner -- so many choices. Indoor and outdoor bars, and the staff at them was very nice. Spacious rooms, lovely pool. All the comforts of home. Very satisfied."
 March 2019,5,Beautiful ambiance,"What a relax after running away from our scheduled ( and Paid) hotel La Rose Noire that was hidden in a scary area surrounded with construction>>luckily we found this hotel and what a difference. Big rooms, nice everything."
 April 2019,2,Not worth the money...,"The hotel is an attractive option in Ouarzazate, which I've visited on numerous occasions. My room was large with a separate sitting area although not the most functional (e.g. tv location). The pool and common areas were aesthetically appealing. Unfortunately, there were a number of problems that presented during my stay. I became ill 4-5 hours after consuming lunch, which necessitated me using the toilet 8 times over the next 24 hours. My health issues continued during the 2 nights I stayed at the Berbere. The front desk staff were generally poor, vacillating between indifference and arrogance, taking their time while I waited at the desk on numerous occasions. The older man in need of braces had an especially poor attitude. Leaving my luggage proved complicated with me…"
 April 2019,1,Hotel and room are ok. Service at restaurants terrible,"Coming from a trip in the desert. Exhausted. They left us wait for an hour to get a table. Then table had no chairs, another 5-10 mins waiting. Then 20 mote minutes until somebody came to take our order. Still no glasses nor forks nor knifes on the table. My wife had already given up past 10pm and went asleep without eating. My kids falling asleep. When finally the waiter came and we confronted him, he said he came fast because we have kids. Are you kidding me !!! In short. You can stay there but go eat somewhere else. Cheaper, better and more friendly."
 April 2019,3,Watch out for your drinks,"At €8.00 for a small bottle of beer, this is not a cheap hotel. It's nice but is in need of a full refurb. The rooms are of a good size, the towels and robes are good quality and the beds comfortable, but bathrooms in the suits need to be sorted. Low water pressure and really do need to be replaced. The food in the buffet restaurant was good and was just what was needed after a 250km foot race across the Sahara. However, keep your hands on your beer. We ordered 5 beers and 2 coke's for €44.00 and had only just had them delivered when we went to the buffet for dinner, returning 5 mins later, all the drinks had been taken away, un-drunk, by the waiters and as much as we complained they were never replaced. The next morning at breakfast, I got up from having just starting…"
 April 2019,5,This is what I call a 5 stars hotel!!,"The hotel is just so great. The swimming pool is so amazing. The room is very large with a sofa. What I like the most is a big queen size bed with a very comfortable mattress. Every things seem to be huge in size here at the hotel, but only a wall flat screen TV that pretty much out of shape. The hotel staff is very helpful. Their is a free WIFI and the signal is so strong through out the premise. Only one complaint I have is that their is no elevator!! My room is 112, but I have to carry my luggage up to the stair for 2 and a half floor, that suck!!"
 March 2019,3,Not accessible,Accessible room is not accessible. No grab bars any where in bathroom. Shower floor very slippery and shower leaks water all over bathroom so the floor becomes very wet. No place to hang hand held shower head so that sprays all over. Not a normal shower head for partner not disabled. No counter space in bathroom. No towel bars or toilet paper holder. It was like they did not finish the bathroom.
 March 2019,5,I hated to leave !,"Just a lovely hotel with nice grounds, pleasing architecture and a nice staff. The restaurant was buffet style and was very good. My room was spacious, clean and had a seating area that was pleasant. There wasn't any sort of view but that wasn't critical. I wish I could have stayed several nights more."
 March 2019,4,Nice stay,"So here is my honest feedback: we were happy to be here after staying in roads and desert. Having all the facilities was a nice welcome. Our room was big like a suite, although the furniture was getting tired and old. The hotel is grand and almost feels like an all inclusive. It has over 200 rooms and the number of big tourist buses with Chinese and American tourists made this place quite impersonal. Food is overpriced. Buffet breakfast was just ok, they don’t even serve coffee to you. This is at best a four star, not 5 star. Nice stay, just attention to details was missing."
 March 2019,3,Very average,Tourist hotel to the max. If you want a hotel that caters to bus loads of tourists all wandering in packs around the hotel this is your place. The rooms are below average and noisy for what is rated as a 5 star hotel. I’ve stayed in nicer Holiday Inns. While clean we still had ants wandering around our bathroom in the morning. The service in restaurants was excellent but the food was mediocre at best.
 March 2019,4,Needed more time,Arrived early evening with tour group INSIGHT. Lovely lobby and grounds - just wished we had had more time to appreciate them. Room was spacious and clean but there was a plate with a knife - so shouldt there have been something we missed out on???? Very good evening and breakfast buffet
 March 2019,2,Much Better places nearby,Very basic hotel that suits maybe very big groups. Too noisy with all these groups. Information on Swimming pool or spa are misleading. Pool is with ice cold water and spa has one stuff member. Food is buffet type mostly for japanese and chinese groups. Did not have to go to Morocco to eat sushi. It was not good experience at all. Nearby about 20min drive there are excellent kasbahs to stay at. Avoid this hotel.
 March 2019,5,Excellent Choice,A lovely spacious property surrounded by thick walls that assures a peaceful garden setting for the individual rooms. Probably the best buffet dinner and breakfast we have ever seen with ample choices. This is where the movie folks stay when they are in town. Well with it.
 March 2019,4,Le Berber Palace,"Beautiful grounds, including pool, beautiful room. Only complaint is that the shower does not drain. Food was good. Love the variety and the separate omelet bar at breakfast. Would definitely go back to this hotel"
 February 2019,5,Beautiful hotel in a lovely town,"The town of Ouarzazate in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco is home to the Atlas Movie Studios, where numerous movies have been filmed (Gladiator, Lawrence of Arabia). This is the reason the hotel is decorated throughout with movie posters, and some areas look like actual movie sets. The rooms are actually in separate units, offering privacy and elegance. We were in a suite with a bedroom and living room, which included a TV, minibar, hair dryer and free wifi. The dining room offered a wide variety of hot and cold dishes served in a tempting buffet. The hotel also has meeting rooms, outdoor and indoor sitting areas, and a pool. Sadly, we only spent one night here. And an extra tip: Across the street from the hotel is a women's art cooperative with many types of local crafts…"
 March 2019,5,Wonderful hotel in the Sahara,"I stayed here for one night during a tour of Morocco with Insight Vacations. The tour leader told us this was his favorite hotel of the trip, and now I can see why. It’s an absolutely lovely hotel with efficient staff providing excellent service. The guest rooms are large and comfortable with all the usual amenities. We had both dinner buffet and breakfast buffet and both were very good. Don’t forget to check out the various paraphernalia from the movie industry which this city is known for."
 February 2019,4,Good hotel,This is a good hotel. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. We were in a suite. I am unsure if they provide single rooms as well. The pool was inviting. The restaurant was good and so was the service. The shower was incorporated in a bath tub which meant that the bathroom was full of water after a shower!
 February 2019,4,Once the hotel of famous movie stars,This is a city where famous movies were filmed including Game of Thrones and many old time stories from Africa. There is a nearby movie studio. The hotel is spacious and decorated with object from past movies. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The grounds were very nice.
 January 2019,5,Beautiful Hotel in a Nice Part of Town,"This hotel is wonderful! The public areas have lots of former sets from movies, fun to see them ""in person"". The dining room is very large and the selection of foods is the best you'd find, something for everyone, very fresh and well prepared. The service was just awesome!"
 January 2019,5,Excellent hotel for comfort and fine dining,"The hotel rooms are located throughout the property in one or two storey buildings. My two bedroom suite was wonderful and provided a good night's sleep. The service was excellent by the staff. Enjoyed the fine dining with outstanding food selection that was presented well. There were props from different movies in the hotel and the grounds. Only spend one night, but a very memorable one."
 February 2019,4,Esmap conference,Excellent facilities and spacious rooms. Clean and comfortable setting. Definitely well worth staying here. Brilliant food and facilities for business and pleasure. Conveniently located to shops and restaurants.
 January 2019,5,Lovely,"The hotel is massive. There was no need to leave. You could even exchange money at the front desk. There is a huge swimming pool, workout room, tennis courts. I had a lovely two bedroom suite on the second level. The breakfast and dinner buffet had soo many options. There was really no need to leave the hotel. My only complaint was that the heater was loud. I unplugged it so that i could sleep and wrapped underneath the covers. Otherwise, my stay here was pleasant."
 December 2018,4,"On balance, probably one the better options for Ouarzazate","To my knowledge, Le Berbere Palace is the only accommodation of it's kind in Ouarzazate - i.e. a large, international scale hotel. It has over 200 rooms. So, if you want to stay in a large hotel (with large hotel facilities), or are part of a tour group (of which there were many at the hotel), it's your only option. We were independent travellers and enjoyed our two night stay at the hotel. It is well-located in Ouarzazate, not that there is that much to walk to in the immediate vicinity. There are a couple of restaurants across the street, but we ate breakfast and dinner at the hotel both nights we were there. There is a choice of an international buffet (35 Euro) as well as a pizza and pasta restaurant (about 15 Euro per person). We ate at both, and they were good. The…"
 December 2018,4,Good place to stay,Good place to stay. Place was huge and very beautiful. Staff was decent and prepared vegetarian food on request. Heating in the room was also good. We stayed for a short while so didnt explore the place completely. Overall a nice experience.
 November 2018,4,Great night sleep be careful on checkout,"The property is lovely and the beds, linens and pillows were quite comfortable. There are three restaurants and we chose the international one. It was an uninspiring buffet and too expensive for the quality of the food. At check out, I was not given the option to pay in the local currency. Our driver was waiting for us and I hopped in the car before I noticed in the fine print that we were charged an additional 3% for paying in US dollar. Since our credit card does not charge an international transaction fee I was really disappointed."
 November 2018,4,Passing Through,We stayed here as we passed through Ouarzazate and found this hotel to be very nice. Our room was very large with a separate lounge and was nicely appointed. The food at the Oasis restaurant was very good and the desserts were heavenly. The front desk staff were however very unfriendly and contrasted with the very welcoming staff at the restaurant.
 November 2018,4,Nice Chalet Hotel,"Le Berbere Palace is an excellent property, we were staying in an apartment type room where there is living room separating from the bed room, and there are two TV sets, one in Living room and the other in bed room. Toilet and bathroom is separated which has a good point for two persons to use one each at the same time. Air conditioning system allows you to adjust the temperature you like, if you feel cold, you can turn on the heater, otherwise you can have nice breezy cold air to pamper you to sleep. Dinner buffet is the best as there are many varieties to suit your taste buds. Buffet breakfast was just a very common one, nothing exciting for me, but their French baguettes were well done, I like them very much. As it is a chalet type, it can be very troublesome during…"
 November 2018,4,Old and nice,"It is located in the center of the city and looks idyllic at the entrance with city walls. The rooms are large, clean, but soon have to be renovated, as well as the main restaurant. Breakfast is good and good service throughout the complex"
 November 2018,4,A palace!,"Beautiful grounds and well kept. The breakfast was wonderful with lots of choices. Fitness center, swimming pool, terraced garden, and free WiFi. Bed was a little hard for my liking, but I ended up laying on top of the comforter. Spacious room and very clean."
 October 2018,5,Great poolside dining!,We had great service poolside from our waiter M’bark. Very courteous and professional. The food was classic Moroccan cuisine and delicious. M’bark made our sure our was stay perfect and helped us pick delicious wine.
 October 2018,4,Charming yet modern,Beautiful Moroccan hotel. It’s an oasis in the middle of city with beautiful pools and lobby. Room we stayed in was on 2nd Floor but had these really steep stairs but bellhops are happy to assist. Room was cold but AC needs a little maintenance since they were making strange sounds during the night. Bed was comfortable while the T&B was clean and tidy which I can not say with the other Moroccan hotels I stayed in. Food during dinner and breakfast was excellent. Would stay here again.
 September 2018,5,The place to stay in Ouarzazate,"This place is opulent. The rooms are grouped all on the ground floor, with lovely landscaping all around. There is also a large pool. The breakfast and dinner buffets are sumptuous. Stay at least one night, even if you are on a budget."
 October 2018,5,Excellent Stay,This is a very large property with beautiful grounds and public spaces (featuring props or replicas from the many films done in the area). Lodging is in many outbuildings spread throughout the ground on lower and upper levels. Second floor rooms require navigating a steep set of stairs so you may want a bell man to assist. Rooms are quite spacious and well equipped although getting a bit worn down. Dining is in a large restaurant set up buffet style for all meals. The food was surprisingly good and the variety of choice welcome after any days of just tagine and cous-cous.
 October 2018,4,"very nice hotel, good restaurant","Beautiful place, big pool. The rooms are large and clean, we had a suite with a sitting area, the room has a safe, refrigerator, and good wifi. The bed was large and comfortable as were the pillows. The AC worked well. The room was quiet. The room also had a private patio, but no chairs or table. The tub was narrow so we had to be careful when using the shower and it was a high step getting in and out.We had the buffet in the restaurant the food was good as was the breakfast in the morning - good variety. The hotel has two bars, the drinks are pricey, but the staff is very friendly and helpful. They do take credit cards but I believe there was a minimum."
 September 2018,3,Terrible service,"This hotel is enormous, we had a very long walk to get to our room which was upstairs though they didnt tell us that when we checked in so we said no to help with our luggage as we had wheels. We arrived in the evening so did a quick change then went to the bar near the pool. My friend and I ( two women) stood at the bar with 3 men standing behind the bar making a effort NOT to make eye contact, a 4th man chatting up a young lady at the end. Eventually, after we asked for service they almost fought to not have to serve us. Buffet dinner was very average in selection so baguette and cheese for us! Room was so hot we asked to sit outside and were reluctantly shown a table. Breakfast was fairly good selection but again we asked to sit outside and they said yes but we had to…"
 August 2018,4,Great hotel in the region!,"Le Berbere Palace is one of the best hotels we’ve stayed in the region with the spacious lobby area and pool. You would feel like you are staying an exotic paradise with good restaurant. I love the relaxing environment and rooms are villa like, spacious and quiet. The pool is a must-visit during your stay! Last but not least, the hotel is strategically located in a very convenient location in the city and you will find shops like craft store, food store across the street. However, some facilities in the room e.g. bathroom facilities are aging and should be renovated."
 September 2018,5,"WOW, what a beautiful hotel","We were lucky to stay here for 2 nights. It is a 5 star hotel with 232 rooms. The air-conditioning was great, the pool gigantic, there was a fitness center/gym and spa. WIFi was free and worked really well. In the room there was a safe, fridge, coffee maker, fruit, hair-dryer, and great shower. We were lucky to be upgraded to a giant room with a living room and expansive porch with table and chairs. The decor of the hotel is beautiful, pool is gigantic, and the food is great. Be sure to only eat the cooked food to save your stomach. Great place to stay."
 September 2018,4,Berber Luxury,"A beautiful setting in Ouarzazate. My junior suite has large bedroom, sitting room, bathroom & separate toilet. TV (unused) in both rooms. There’s even a private patio. Complimentary WiFi is strong. Good dinner in the Italian restaurant. There’s also a Moroccan restaurant that I did not try. The spa features typical Arab Hamman experience. I had a Hamman bath with black soap, body scrub & argan oil massage. Then hair wash & blowout all for about US$45 including gratuity."
 September 2018,4,Great pool,"Stayed here for two nights. Had dinner buffet the first night which was very good, especially the lamb. Breakfast was nothing special, in fact a disappointment. The hotel has a beautiful pool however poolside drinks are very expensive- $8+USD PER BEER. We stayed in room 404 which has easy access to the pool and restaurant. This room has a king size bed, living room, porch and bath."
 June 2018,5,5-star treatment,"Great lobby with film props, good pool and lots of separate accommodation blocks. Our suite was some walk away from the entry (about 100 meters) and was up a narrow, steep stairwell. Once there, it was a large and very pleasant 2-bedroom family unit with separate sitting room, bathroom and toilet room. The view was of the nearby gardens. The King bed was comfortable, the bedroom spacious with two windows, blackout curtains, safe, large TV (with another in the sitting room), very good storage and very good air-con. It was very clean and well cared for. There was a good coffee machine and bottled water provided. The shower was in the bath with both glass and plastic curtains. However, the bath was narrow was tight for the shower and it was hard to adjust the water temperature…"
 August 2018,2,It simply does not interest them,"When I arrived at the hotel I was not exactly welcomed. The receptionist was very short. The room was good and also the bed was good. A small update would not be wrong, I think. Disappointing was the dinner. Both the starter and main course were disappointing. Both the salmon from the starter and the chicken from the main course were dry as if it had been around for some time. The chicken was hard and tasteless. Typical tourist food but not appropriate for a five-star hotel. The annoying thing is: it simply does not interest them."
 August 2018,4,Large suites scattered in the grounds in 2 story houses,"I was shown to a huge suite which had a massive bedroom, separate sitting room and a large bathroom. The bedroom had a hard bed, a desk & a dressing table. The bed was made up with a duvet. There was a safe attached to the bedroom cupboard.There was a bright light on air conditioning unit which lit up the room at night which was a little annoying.The bathroom was quite well lit but didn’t have a shaving mirror. A weak hairdryer was provided as well as some large towels. There was a separate toilet. The sitting room had two sofas (which could be turned into bed if you were staying with family) as well as a fridge. There were 2 TVs but they only had CNN & BBC World. There was a small outside terrace with a small table & 2 chairs. The Wi-Fi was weak especially at peak times. The…"
 August 2018,4,Logistics Perfection & very nice personnel,"If you have real time to visit Morocco you simply cannot miss Ouarzazate. Here you find this really nice Hotel. We stayed here two nights and overall evaluation is very good. Nice people that warms you on checking in. Immediate and efficient suggestions on best ways to have ""desert and Atlas"" experience (fantastic choice of drivers and guides ready to be booked from concierge). The room is very clean and a little bit old style Morocco furnished but it is good. Restaurant offer three style menus. Among them Morocco food simply fantastic (you have direct view on the Cook from the table near the pool). The pool is really nice and offers a corner with sofas and a lighting that can compete with a showroom of interior design. There is one only thing to be improved ... Breakfast…"
 July 2018,4,"Nice hotel, good food and service. Nice pool.","I liked the Berber Palace. It is not an extraordinary luxury hotel, the interiors can be a bit tacky at times. The service is not very personal, however it is decent. The food at the restaurant by the pool is very nice, and the pool itself is not bad. I think this is probably the best option in Ouarzazate."
 July 2018,4,Well-appointed but slightly aloof,"Nice smart place, perhaps surprisingly upmarket given the modest size of the city. We dined at the Italian restaurant, which served delicious pizza and huge burgers amid faded movie props and posters. Both there and by the large inviting pool the hotel staff were not overly friendly - aloof rather than merely professional - a pity, as it took the shine off an otherwise impressive offering. Don’t come here for a glimpse of interesting Moroccan culture, but if you are looking for a swanky oasis in a dusty town, it’s a good place to visit."
 June 2018,1,Avoid this place,"The property is beautiful and the sets and props from old movies are a joy to view/browse, especially the throne from the set of the Ten Commandments. I have nothing bad to say about the property itself. Even the pool and lounging area surrounding it is gorgeous. However, the staff.... The staff here was VERY unfriendly. I had a friend who I had met years ago lived locally to this hotel. Because he was a local they actually had security REFUSE to let him come visit me in my room, we were told that we HAD to stay in either the lobby or the pool area. How ridiculous! Also, I was traveling with a group of friends, my suitemate and another traveler went to book a spa service, a type of full body scrub/bath. When my friend entered (after disrobing and putting on the 'thong')…"
 May 2018,4,A luxury hotel.,"This is a very beautiful hotel. It is huge. The guest rooms are arranged in rows according to the numbers, at the back of the main building. The dining room is in the main building itself. We had our breakfast there. It was a very good spread of both hot and cold food. Throughout the main building, there are Egyptian statues everywhere. There is a nice Swimming pool and a spa near the pool area. The whole place is beautifully designed with plants and statues. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. If you want a nice, relaxing massage, then this is the place for you. If you need a therapeutic massage, then you are wasting your money. It didn’t do a thing for me! Cost? $30. There is also the hamam which is like the Turkish bath. An attendant will scrub you all over. Then…"
 May 2018,4,First class hotel if you don't mind the crowds,"After staying in Riads for most of our trip we were surprised to be placed at this huge hotel. We had a very nice, large, room and were well placed away from any real noise. The grounds were large and very pleasant. We arrived for dinner along with a horde of other tourists and joined them in feeding from the buffet. There was a lot of choice and the quality of the food was good so we had a good meal. It was the same for breakfast the next morning with a great variety of good quality choices."
 May 2018,5,wow lovely lovely,after being in the sahara desert i really did think i had found paradise. the area is terrific and this hotel has all the comforts. beautiful hotel and grounds the bathrooms are exraordinary there are lots of articles from movies shot in the desert. the area is know for its move production.
 May 2018,3,"Overall, A Good Stay","This exotic and somewhat older Ouarzazate hotel has large grounds with movie props scattered both in and out. We had a nice and large room with a comfortable bed and plenty of space. The in room safe was old and did not seem to work. This, however was not a deal breaker. The staff were welcoming and friendly and we had a nice night’s sleep. We ate a good lunch at the hotel as we were told that other places might not agree with our US digestive systems. At dinner, our waiter was overwhelmed, inattentive and took a few times to get our order correct. The dinner was not as tasty as other Morocco hotels. Breakfast, however, was very good. Given the amazing location, we are pleased that we came, even with a few issues."
 May 2018,4,A palace like feel,"A splashing pool welcomes one as they walk through the door to the spacious, old world feel lobby. The ceilings are high and one does feel as if they might be in a palace. Some of the rooms are in a garden area. Our room had air conditioning, a spacious, comfortable sitting area, very comfortable separate bedroom with its own air conditioner. Clean and comfortable. Service was rather good."
 April 2018,4,Disappointing,"We stayed here with a small tour group and had been looking forward to it. Sadly our expectations were not met. The bedroom and adjoining living room were good and the bed comfortable. We were a bit of a way from reception which was fine as the gardens were pretty. The pool looked very appealing but an hammam meant we didn't have time to swim. The food was easily the poorest on our 10 day tour of Morocco. Bland, uninspiring and simply not tasty. Service was poor both in the restaurant and overall (other tour groups seemed to be getting more attention and assistance). They could reduce the score to 3 stars. It feels like a hotel that's trading on past glories rather then continuing to improve."
 April 2018,4,Quality tourist hotel,Our room was spacious but a long way from the main reception block and the room number was poorly signposted . Free botled water and excellent room amenities. We had a small terrace surrounded by high concrete wall. Unpleasant and useless. Friendly staff. Well-stocked breakfast buffet. Beginning to look a bit rundown this is a better quality tourist hotel.
 May 2018,3,Just OK,"More like 3 1/2 stars. The lobby and the property is beautiful, the rooms were spacious but definitely need an update especially the bathroom. Pool area is gorgeous. Breakfast was extensive but just OK. This is definitely a churn and burn tourist hotel and maybe a conference center. Probably one of the better places in the area but nothing to get too excited about."
 April 2018,2,Mediocre,"We spent 2 nights at Le Berbere Palace. The room was spacious and clean. That said, the place is generally a bit run down. The staff was not especially welcoming. We walked in and out of the lobby without any acknowledgment whatsoever from the front desk. Breakfast was ok but certainly nothing special. When we checked out we were surprised to be charged $12 for using the 4 little coffee pods. I have never been charged for self serve coffee in my room before! Over all it was adequate but I would not expect the 4 stars that they claim. Pool area is nice but again, service is definitely lacking. Ps we were in an upstairs room. The stairs are especially treacherous. ー"
 April 2018,3,Average hotel,"The hotel is a resort hotel, all hotel rooms are located on the ground floor; the room is reasonable size but the light is too dime and cleanliness was poor, ants 🐜 found in the rooms and toilet bowl loosened, really need improvement on maintenance and cleanliness. Breakfast was good, many choices but dinner was disappointed ."
 April 2018,5,Beautiful Hotel!!,"Spent just one night at this wonderful hotel while on a tour of Morocco. Would have loved to stay an extra night. The hotel is quite large with the rooms spread out like a townhouse complex. There are ground level rooms with rooms above that are accessed by a narrow winding stair case. Tricky to navigate if your luggage is bulky and/or heavy. Rooms are spacious- I had small sitting room, bedroom and terrace. Beautiful grounds, pool and spa. Bar offers beer, wine and a few cocktails. Very close to lots of restaurants and shopping. Breakfast buffet was fantastic- lots of choice!! Loved my one night and would highly recommend."
 April 2018,4,Lovely with some issues,"The room was lovely and the buffet was much better than other hotels. However, the ceiling of the shower area was full of mold. Housekeeping needs improvement. Repairs to broken tiles is expected in a hotel with this rating."
 April 2018,5,An Oasis of Comfort and Friendly Service in the Atlas!,"My wife, four daughters and I stayed here the week of April 1st for one night after a couple days in Erfoud and the Sahara. The quality of the rooms and hotel is very good. The service was also exceptional. They even accommodated my wife's gluten allergy. Throughout our stay the staff worked hard to meet our requests. The pool area is very nice and my children enjoyed it. If you are travelling through Ouarzazate, I would highly recommend a night or two at the Berbere Palace."
 April 2018,5,A real gem,"Having spend a only a night at this great resort, after we pleased with their excellent cuisine, fine professional service, we didn’t want to leave. This is a place, if you want to spoil yourself. Rooms were enormous and extremely clean. Tons of amenities gratis welcome water and soft drinks with a Nespresso coffee maker. Surely there isn’t anything else to need!"
 March 2018,3,Nice Hotel but the food is inedible,"The hotel itself is nice, clean and well located. A few things in the room didn't work perfectly but the room itself was great. The food however was the worst. There was absolutely nothing that was edible at the dinner buffet and breakfast was not much better. The hotel appears to cater to large busloads of tourists."
 April 2018,4,Stylish but a bit touristy,"I was looking forward to staying here as it has a great reputation. Our room was a small suite with a separate living room plus bedroom and bathroom. It was a little way to our room but the gardens are lovely. I was bitten by something in bed (probably a mosquito) although it was cool. The pool is beautiful and some people were swimming in it although it was not that warm. I had a back massage in the Spa which was simply wonderful. Recommended! The only disappointment was the eating. This was buffet style and because it was catering to tour groups it was bland and safe, both in evening and at breakfast. I would have expected a higher standard. There may have been other eateries in the hotel. The hotel had an efficient means of getting luggage to and from our rooms."
 April 2018,5,Great hotel with a high standard,"A great hotel with a high standard, very clean, a very comfortable bed, great meals, courteous and smiling service as befits the beautiful Morocco! We stayed there on holiday and arranged for us a beautiful table for 20 people, we celebrated with a good atmosphere and support from the professional hotel staff. It is highly recommended!"
 April 2018,4,Very nice hotel,The rooms were very large. The Chinese restaurant and Italian restaurant were very good. Was surprised that they were empty. This was a great hotel for the location. The bar had nice cocktails and the pool area was beautiful
 April 2018,4,Nice complex,It is a very hotel complex in the design of a Riad. Our room was spacious. You walk through garden areas to get to your room. Breakfasts are buffet and more than enough choices. The bar staff is very attentive and friendly though out the pool courtyard. Pool is impressive but water is not heated for the time of year. Our room was a ground level unit. We had patio door access to a private seating area which made no sense as it was very small and walled out 2.5 feet and about 10 feet highly. To small for you to even stand in. We had a problem with the hvac as the air and the heat ran at the same time but it was fixed in due course. It is close to the shopping area.
 March 2018,2,Beijing or Morocco?,"I was really looking forward to staying here but was quite disappointed. We were shown to our room with a king size bed which I asked no less than three times if it was a king bed. Of course, it wasn’t and had to go all the back to reception and find a new room. While doing this a bus or two of Chinese tourists pulled in and I had to interrupt 500 people to find a room with what I had requested and had been promised. Finally got to the room and it wasn’t fully cleaned – the staff were still in the room – (6pm) and they finished up after 15 or 20 minutes. Unfortunately, they missed the mold around the tub and the ants on the floor. We had dinner and breakfast included but no one told us what to do or where to go. I tried going to each restaurant, but they weren’t open…"
 March 2018,5,Beautiful hotel!,"While touring Morocco, we were fortunate enough to spend a night here. The room was like a small apartment with a large separate living room, huge bedroom and a walled courtyard. Tour groups ate in the dining room that served buffet and everything was delicious. The grounds were beautifully maintained and service was friendly and professional."
 March 2018,3,Quirky but best in Ouarzazate,This is a very large hotel complex with rooms that are best described as villas. Many actors stay here as it is the best hotel in town and the area boasts two large film studios. We had room service which was nice but I can't comment on the restaurants. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. In warmer months there are plenty of common areas to sit out and enjoy a meal and with our ground floor villa we had a small courtyard with table and chairs. A great place to stop if you're driving through to the Western Sahara.
 March 2018,2,Large tourist hotel,"Driving up to this large hotel were at least three large coach buses. It appears this is a hotel used by tour operators. The style of the hotel is similar to a three star resort style hotel you would find in Cuba or Mexico (less the ocean). The hotel has a 1970's feel (likely the last time renovated). Room: A sitting room and bedroom. The furniture was old and chipped. Very dark. One good feature a circa 2017, 32"" TV that worked (snowy picture though). Bathroom: Dirty and old. The water temperature in the shower was either very hot or very cold. Dining: Our rate included dinner at the buffet. Food was unappetizing and cold when it should be hot and warm when it should be cold. I did not eat the meat or prepared salad. The restaurant charged for a bottle of water. …"
 February 2018,5,REALLY FIVE STARS,"Nice building, attractive location, nice decoration. We had a room with two areas, one are with a double room and another one with two beds. Everything was clean and the furniture was nice. The breakfast buffet was of good quality. Internet was free of charge. Rooms are in different buildings. Our room was in a second floor and the access was through a narrow stairs, not easy to climb with luggage. In a few words: I recommend it."
 February 2018,5,Very comfortable,We had a huge suite here and all the comforts we could have wanted. We also had dinner and breakfast here and the buffets were very good (did not try ordering off the menu). They also had a bar and wine available. Lots of movie props around adding a campy/fun feel--the area of Morocco is where a lot of movies were produced. The pool looked beautiful (we were here in off season).
 February 2018,5,Great location and Hotel Staff and Amenities,"We had a sort of a junior suite, which was very nice with a couch/seating area, a king-sized bed and a patio. The rooms are along outside pathways lined with palm trees. There is the normal level of cinema paraphernalia for Ouarzazate. This is a good location to see some of the World Heritage sites on this side of the Atlas Mountains. A great pool area and decent restaurant (all buffet when we were there in off season, but very good). Large comfortable lobby with fountain area."
 February 2018,1,Don't Recommend this place at all,"My review is for the customer service this hotel has. I booked a reservation through ""Booking"". And after; I modified and paid EXTRA to add breakfast ($40 Euros). Since we did a trip to different hotels in Morroco that we reserved through Booking, I got confused about the breakfast and didn't remember it was in this hotel. I have to say that when we arrived to the hotel at night, no body told us information about the breakfast or anything. The next day, we left. And the following nights when we arrive to the other hotel we had booked in Essaouira, they told us about the breakfast info; I told them we had it included and they say no. So basically is when I found out we had the breakfast included at Berbere Palace where no body gave us information even about the breakfast hours…"
 January 2018,5,Best hotel in Ouarzazate,"The reviews of hotels in this city mostly complain about freezing cold rooms and worn and old interiors. We had a similar experience so we changed to the Berbere Palace, and felt like we were in heaven. A fantastic place with the super cosy rooms in a tranquil garden. The hotel has 4 restaurants, of which we appreciated the Asian best, the chef there really can cook! There's also a great bar with an open fire. The staff is very helpful and the pool is heated even in the winter which also seemed to be a rare thing in Ouarzazate. We enjoyed our stay here immensely. The only negative experience being the transport to the bus station that a porter ordered for us. It was seven times as expensive as going with a regular taxi, so we declined and found one ourselves."
 January 2018,4,"Beautiful suite in a fun hotel, lots of movie props","Our suite was gorgeous and set on a walkway near a small seating area with fountain. Lovely! Staff knew us immediately and greeted us, served us our favorite drinks, taught us how to use their computer keyboard. Great hotel. Town is a crossroads to many other destinations but not much on its own."
 January 2018,3,Nice but overpriced,"This is the best hotel in Ouarzazate and itis very nice indeed Rooms are the best thing, nice and well equipped Service and staff is average, breakfast below standards for a five star hotel Considering the overall thing it is decisively overpriced, not worth a visit under this perspective. The rates would indeed require a better service"
 January 2018,5,Nice place. Stopped for lunch!,The place is very nice. Enjoyable atmosphere. The wait staff is slow in responding and the food was fairly good. Probably one of the nicest places in town. Beware of the police. They are serious about traffic infractions and are not forgiving. Monitor speed limits carefully.
 December 2017,5,Lives up to it’s 5 star rating,Very well appointed luxury hotel with large rooms that come with all the amenities including complimentary water and toiletries. Great bar area with a roaring fire and live music plus good selection of spirits and wines. Rooms are spread out all one level out the back with lots of open common areas with nice seating. Large pool that is heated but still cold by my standards but others liked. Multiple restaurants but main dining has a very extensive buffet with lots of options including pork products. Dinner included a string quartet to entertain diners which had excellent musicians.
 December 2017,5,Lovely stay,Beautiful hotel with great accommodations. Spacious rooms/suites with good amenities. Comfortable beds. The buffet and Italian restaurants were very good! The wait staff well trained. A highlight of our journey through Morocco!
 December 2017,3,An alright place to stay,"Nice location, as you can walk to many things you want to see in the little town. The rooms are probably 4 star equivalent and clean (we had 2 junior suits). Ok for the price we paid. The restaurant which you can often see as highly rate we felt was quite average compared to thing s like jardins des aromes for example. You do sit very nicely though. You also sit very nicely in the bar, but again things like cocktail offerings are quite average. Staff was in general friendly, notably to children. What made me give this stay 3 rather than 4 stars was clearly the pool. It is always a key thing for us when we chose a hotel that there’s is a working pool. That just happens to be how we work out. We even called from the US to ask if the pool, as advertised on the web, was indeed…"
 November 2017,4,Cute concept - the movie industry connection.,"The rooms are in rows of single and double story buildings. We had a deluxe room, which was actually two rooms. The first one we got stank of smoke, but, fortunately, they had another room to give us. Bed was comfortable, and bathroom well appointed, with nice smellies. The lounge part of the room was a bit spartan. Separate w/c, which is always a nice touch. Front desk were a little brusque. We could hear the pipes every time the room upstairs had a showere or used the w/c."
 November 2017,3,Nice lodging en route to Marrakech,Pretty large hotel with a cinema-oriented decoration motif. I'm sure the roximity to Atlas Studios was the inspiration. Room was fine; common areas nicely appointed. Dinner was buffet - which proved to be an issue the next day as something caused a bout of food poisoning (not too bad considering we had the requisite drugs). Only negative about the hotel is the amount of smokers and the lack of separation for non-smokers.
 November 2017,5,Wonderful hotel!,The hotel room was very nice; quiet; and located near outdoor lounging space with pergolas and opportunity for drinks. There were no parties or other such distractions in the lounging areas. Very private. The dining room was set up for buffet breakfasts and dinners for tour groups and other guests. Quite a spread of choices in the meals.
 October 2017,3,"Beautiful surrounds, rooms could be better",This hotel is impressive on the outside. However the rooms are tired and ours smelt of mildew. General maintenance was poor. We booked massages to have on arrival only to be told that they couldn't be done. My friend ordered room service and it never showed up. Needs a great deal of improvement.
 October 2017,4,Very restful and peaceful place to stay,"Lovely setting, like being in a garden. Nice room and a good size. The food buffet was substantial and the food was good. Bring your swimming suit for a swim in the great pool. Very restful and peaceful place to stay."
 September 2017,5,A beautiful hotel! Would have liked to have stayed longer!,"Stayed as part of an organized tour and was disappointed not to have more time at the hotel. Our room had a separate living room which made it very comfortable. A lot of film and movie 'props' throughout the hotel, which makes for interesting corners and places to sit. A beautiful 'oasis' in Oaurzazate."
 September 2017,4,comfortable night's stay,"After three nights in the sahara, this was a great place to relax at for a change of pace. the room was very nice and spacious. the food was a good change of pace from all the moroccan food and the pool was just what we needed to relax. this was the only hotel we stayed at in morocco that did not include breakfast. we decided to order breakfast to our room instead of both going to the buffet. the price was still 200 dirham to have breakfast delivered to our room and it didn't include all the items that were mentioned in the menu. that was the only disappointing part of our stay."
 September 2017,5,Excellent stay,"The Hotel Le Berbere Palace is an excellent stop on the route through the mountains. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The public rooms and restaurant were also excellent. After a long day's drive, the hotel was a lovely place to unwind and relax."
 September 2017,4,"Good, not great","Spent only one night here as part of a tour. Our suite was large and well equipped although a good distance from reception. Whilst there was coffee and tea making equipment in the living area, there was no convenient power source. A lock on the bedroom window was inoperable.The pool area is lovely with some very merry gentlemen staffing the poolside bar. I went to pay my bar bill at 9.00pm and was told the cashier was not available and I should pay upon checkout. Not really five star service. The breakfast buffet was adequate but several folk on my tour, including me, pressed the cappuccino button on the machine and received hot chocolate. There are some interesting props from films made in the area, in particular the chair of the pharaoh from the film Cleopatra. Do not…"
 September 2017,5,Beautiful hotel so sad we didnt actually stay here,"Stopped here for lunch on our travels through Morocco and wish our tour company had booked rooms here rather than at some of the ""authentic"" filthy riads. The lunch was far superior to anything we had on our tour. After several days of tanjine and couscous it was nice to have actual food again. A definite shining star in the desert."
 September 2017,5,Moroccan Oasis,"Le Berbere Palace is a gem as you head through morocco. The accommodations are nice, but the surrounding resort features are outstanding! The staff was terrific as well. Only recommendation is on the food. It is the best game in town, but it is mediocre at best."
 September 2017,5,Moroccan Oasis,"After a number of rustic, sometimes filthy hotels along our Moroccan travels, the Le Berbere Palace was a welcome oasis. Large, bright and clean rooms promised a good night's rest. The different restaurants on site provided choices for Italian, Asian and Moroccan cuisine. We ate at the Italian restaurant one evening and the offerings were tasty and met expectations. Prices were fair - the fresh squeezed orange juice, in particular, was priced only at 20Dh, a super value. I highly recommend this hotel for her friendly, well-trained staff, the clean, comfortable rooms, the clean swimming pool and the convenience and variety of on-site restaurants."
 August 2017,5,Great hotel,"Stayed here a couple of times . Great hotel and buffet . Pool is brilliant . Quiet location, with a few things to do in the local area , but a good location to chill. Rooms are really nice and have the luxury feel . Would recommend"
 April 2017,5,Well maintained Superior Hotel,"Very nice hotel with big pool! Food was great and they offered a variety of choices. One small caution, the pool entry/exit is a little slippery. We enjoyed food and drinks by the pool and it was so relaxing. The room were very spacious and comfortable. There not much around the hotel, that we could find, the town seemed deserted but they hotel had enjoy beautiful grounds to walk and enjoy."
 June 2017,5,"Le Berbere Palace, Ouarzazate",We were part of a tour group. This hotel was the best hotel we stayed at during the whole 14 day tour. The rooms were spectacular and the food was fantastic! The pool area is a great place to relax. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone.
 May 2017,4,Nice luxury in an unexpected locale,"Having just spent 3 days camping in the desert, the Berber Palace was more than welcome. It is a large, full service, luxury hotel with all the commensurate amenities. Our room was large and comfortable with a sitting area off the bedroom. The hotel grounds are lush and the pool area is like an oasis. Quarzazate is/was a favorite locale for the movie industry in making ""desert"" pictures and many of the production companies stayed here. You can tell because the grounds are sprinkled with the former props used in the movies - everything from ancient statues to royal carriages and even Cleopatra's throne. Brings a smile if not memories. Restaurant food is quite good and the al fresco dining makes it even more enjoyable."
 May 2017,4,Special fun for movie freaks,"As we arrived a whole group of Spanish women dressed in purple djellabas wandered the lobby level taking photos while posing on Pharaoh's throne,with helpers waiving Ostrich plumes while Egyptian God statues rounded up the scene. Room and food very good"
 April 2017,2,"Grounds are lovely, but the hotel room was not very clean.","Really wish that we had stayed elsewhere. While the grounds are stunning the hotel is huge and our room was nothing special, very small bathroom with lots of bugs flying around. Glad that it was for only one night."
 May 2017,5,Always like to come back,"This is one of my favorite hotels in all Morocco. Calm atmosphere, great food, very good service and friendly stuff. The hotel itself is an experience when traveling around the country. There is nothing to complain about."
 May 2017,5,A pampering hotel,"A luxurious hotel. lobby, garden and pool are large luxurious and spectacular in beauty Large clean rooms are tastefully equipped with comfortable furniture and very pampering beds Restaurant A restaurant with varied tasty meals and high class service"
 April 2017,4,A covenient Oasis...,"This hotel is quite convenient for any stay in Ouarzazate. It has a great location, pretty good wi Fi, rooms full of space that offer a fair 4.5 star experience, beautiful pool area and hamacs. Has a great and huge sports-bar area, great lounge, an Italian restaurant that also offers a fair breakfast. Couldn't swim because the water was cold as ice; but tried the spa..... Magnificent experience and service received. I wouldn't hesitate to visit it again {!!!!!!!👍👍"
 April 2017,4,Luxury with character,The hotel impressed at first sight with its centrepiece tiled display pool and colourful tiled surrounds. It also caught the eye with its monumental ancient sculpture in its passageways reminding one of museums but in a decorative way. There is a large swimming pool although we did not use it.
 December 2016,5,"A well-named 'palace' featuring Berber culture! Highly recommended, especially if you drive an electric vehicle!","A really great team with a warm and enthusiastic welcome, to their marvellous and rather special hotel, set in extensive grounds, with mid-sized rooms, in nice comfortable chalets along beautifully maintained pathways. The spectacular massive adobe-built main building houses extensive function rooms, restaurants, lounges and encloses a spacious courtyard with terraces and swimming pool. The New Year's Eve party organised by the hotel featured mainly Berber musicians and dancers, also New Year little presents (with locally-produced cosmetics from roses cultivated along the Dades Valley!) were left for us in the room, which were very much appreciated! The hotel restaurant featured some really unusual, but amazing dishes (like beef & quince slowly cooked tagines and not only!)…"
 April 2017,4,MdS post race,"I stayed here for two nights after finishing the Marathon des Sables in Morocco. The hotel is beautiful with a fab pool. The grounds are lovely. Two is us shared a room which was lovely; two large twin beds in a large room on the ground floor. A separate sitting area with large TV. A separate WC and a shower/bathroom with bidet. Seemed more like a mini suite. The room was lovely and clean. The only niggle in the room was no tea, coffee or bottled water in the room. Luckily we still had some bottled water from the coach back to the hotel but we'd have loved a coffee. The only other thing was trying to find the room. We spent ages trying to our room, the numbering is a bit haphazard so a bit more signposting would be really helpful. We couldn't fault the staff or the food…"
 May 2017,4,Best in town,Best hotel in Ourzazate. Built for movie stars. Pleasant place with good rooms and dining. Comfortable place to stay after the desert. We did not spend much time here at the hotel or the town.breakfast included with the room.
 April 2017,4,Almost excellent,"After days in a tent, this place felt like paradise. A large pool with a bar and lots of seating, pretty grounds with flowers and seating areas, suites with a living area, bedroom, patio, and divided bath. It was pleasant and totally adequate. But the tub had a treacherous curved bottom and poor water pressure, the patio was a barren concrete enclosed space, and wifi was operable only in the lobby, It just doesn't rate 5 stars."
 April 2017,3,Nice Rooms . Poor Food,"We arrive in exhausted after a long trip and hope for an early dinner but the buffet is not open until 8.00pm. Then we are first in and get seated and quickly go for food and collect food that is already cold. The only tasty part is the lamb. The room is comfortable - beds good, fruit basket, separate sitting area. So it is a mixture of highlights and lowlights."
 April 2017,4,Nice Retreat!,"I stayed here after completing the Marathon Des Sables and after seeing other local hotels we landed on our feet! Reception has a large water feature and sofas. Pool area is nice with good seating just needs the odd clean but nothing major, pool is cool and deep! Bar prices are quite high so be aware. Room was a family room with 2 bathrooms and a lounge area. Gardens are kept well and staff are pleasant. At dinner they are too quick to clear tables and even removed 4 glasses of wine and the bottle which they replaced after a small debate. Food is if a good standard just not labelled as to what it actually is so a little guess work required. All in all a good hotel and there is a nice spice shop around the corner which also does a Hamman and massage, very recommend!"
 April 2017,5,Just Classy,"The only downside after checking into this resort was that we had to depart the following late morning. Lovely grounds, pool, stocked bar, and breakfast buffet to satisfy any temptation! Go, have fun . . .🍹"
 April 2017,4,Very tranquil,The grounds are beautiful and the pool area is peaceful. I stayed here for 2 nights after completing the Marathon Des Sables. The staff were very welcoming. Food was nice with plenty of variety. Wifi is available but it does drop out fairly frequently. The rooms are clean and tidy and cleaned every day. There are complementary 'smellies' too which is always a bonus! It is centrally located within walking distance to shopping areas. It seemed to be one of the nicer hotels in the area. Exchange rate is a bit iffy. Check and double check your bill....
 April 2017,5,Jasmine in the evening,"They shoot a lot of movies in this area, e.g. Jewel of the Nile, Gladiator, etc. The movie stars stay in this hotel. Jackie Chan was here when I was, but I didn't see him. The hotel is new and really beautiful--the nicest place I stayed in two weeks in Morocco. The food buffet was outstanding, for breakfast and for dinner. One glaring shortcoming--the coffee is brewed in a machine and was the worst coffee we had in all of Morocco. They have a lot of movie set pieces all around the hotel. Now, why did I mention jasmine? The rooms are in little bungalows and when you walk to them, you walk past a lot of jasmine bushes and it smells terrific."
 April 2017,5,Fantastic,"The hotel grounds, gardens, and pool are exceptional. Our room was quite large and beautifully appointed. The breakfast and dinner buffets were excellent. A fun tidbit: There were props from old movies scattered around the hotel. Ouarzazate is the center of the Moroccan film industry, which probably justifies having hotels like this available. We had a second floor room, giving us some views and nice sun exposure; the stairs were rather steep and tight, but the staff handled our luggage. Our impression was that first floor rooms might be claustrophobic."
 April 2017,5,Beautiful,"Beautiful hotel and grounds. Spectacular infinity pool surrounded by a large multi seating patio. Variety of plants and flowers dot the well manicured grounds. The bedrooms are spacious, well appointed with wifi, air conditioning, comfortable beds and a separate water closet. A fresh fruit plate in the room welcomes your arrival."
 April 2017,4,Functional and Enjoyable Hotel by Local Remote Town Standards,"The hotel is a rather place with ample space for many guests. There's a large pool and outdoor lounging area. Also one large main restaurant serving buffet that never seemed fully occupied when we visited. The hotel seems to be set up for far more guests than when we visited in April. One large bar was not open as a result but looked promising. Rooms were basic and decent, but not luxurious, so spending time in the rest of the hotel seemed more appealing. Service was friendly and helpful. The town seemed easy to walk around and looked reasonably safe... was a little disappointed we didn't venture out to try restaurants upon the advice of the hotel concierge that we should just dock to the hotel buffet restaurant. Not that the food was bad just that it was your standard…"
 April 2017,5,Two days tranquility after a week in the desert...,"Stayed at the Berbere this weekend after completing the MdS. The organisers had booked a number of hotels in Ouarzazate and this was by far the best of those I saw/visited. Both breakfast and dinner were on a buffet basis, and considering that the hotel was full, the standard of food provided was extremely good. Staff were very helpful and the place was very clean. We had a room with a double and single bed, and so had lots of space. The bathroom was a nice size but was probably the one aspect that was a bit tired (cracked floor tiles, old style shower in bath) but was still perfectly fine. One point I would make is to try and pay for extras in local currency as the exchange rates in the hotel can be a bit challenging."
 April 2017,5,Great Hotel Excellent Service,"We were surprised to come to such a great hotel in such a remote town. The Hotel and its facilities are first rate / class. The concierge was so helpful, polite and went overboard to get us a wonderful suite (though we paid for just a room). The lobby is beautiful, the gardens are immaculately kept and gorgeous. The room was out standing."
 March 2017,4,A nice spot in Moroccan Hollywood,"I stayed here as part of a group tour and I can't really complain. I will outline my experience: Pros: - beautifully manicured grounds which added to the peacefulness and tranquility - spacious room - breakfast buffet was ok - slept like a log as it was not noisy - rooms are like seperate villas amongst beautiful gardens - lovely pool area - towels were white , fluffy and clean CONS: - bathroom had mould in the grout in the shower tiles - shower over curved bath- very slippery - no tea and coffee facilities- you need to pay extra for that - no iron and ironing board - dinner buffet was rubbish except for the deserts Once again I think that the Moroccan idea of 5 star is different to the western standard of 5 star. I would not rate this hotel as 5 star. In my opinion it is 4…"
 March 2017,4,Large opulent hotel with Movie Set Themes throughout,"This hotel is large with large spaces throughout, including the rooms. After staying in a desert tented camp, this was a nice change to recharge for the rest of our trip. The front desk staff were polite but not overly enthusiastic. The restaurant waiters were more than enthusiastic to take your plates away when you were finished. The restaurant food was buffet style, a large room seating more than 100, and it was loud and crowded. The food was bland but there was sufficient ""spicy"" condiments to help the food along. As this hotel is utilized by lots of the tour companies, expect it to be loud, crowded, and noisy during the high season."
 March 2017,1,Terrible Stay - Stay somewhere else,"We booked this hotel through expedia, and was very excited to stay here. STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! The staff here is very rude, when you check in, no one speaks english, and they are very rude. Finally we got our key, and was taken to the room. The room is like an apartment, like suite style, one bedroom. The furniature is extremeley outdated, and the room is very outdated. Stains everywhere, cough is very old. The room smelled, so we asked to go to new room and when they showed us new room, it was smaller and smelled the same, so we stayed in our room. We wanted some tea or coffee in the room, and none. so we called, and the guy said you can call room service and pay for tea or coffee. We then called for towels, since one fell on the floor, and the guy said he doesnt have anyone who…"
 March 2017,5,Fantastic Property,The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was nicely appointed and very spacious.The buffet breakfast was excellent. A sightseeing tour of the hotel was required to take in all of the movie set decor. The wifi access to the internet was poor.
 August 2016,4,You feel like a Celebrity here!,"Immediately after you step inside this hotel you feel like you're on a movie set. Pieces from various blockbuster movie sets are scattered throughout this hotel. It doesn't take long to realize why they call Ouarzazate the Moroccan Hollywood. Movies like Lawrence of Arabia, Star Wars, Babel, and Cleopatra were all shot in this town, and a lot of the actors from those movies stayed in this very hotel. It's a very sheikh place, with villa style rooms, which means there are no towers, only ground floor rooms. The staff is super friendly, and the amenities are top notch, with a great pool area, and huge exercise facility. The food was the only thing that lacked at his hotel. It wasn't terrible, but not worth the price they were charging for it. There are a lot better meals…"
 August 2016,4,Straight out of Hollywood,"As soon as you enter this hotel you feel like you're on a movie set. Set pieces from various blockbuster movies are scattered throughout this hotel... you definitely get a good feel for why Ouarzazate is called by many the Moroccan Hollywood. Movies such as Star Wars, Babel, and Cleopatra were shot in this town, and many of the actors from those movies stayed at this very hotel. It's a sheik hotel, with villa style rooms. There are no towers, only ground floor rooms. The rooms are very spacious, and elegantly designed. The staff is super friendly, and the amenities are great. Nice pool area, and a very big exercise facility. The food was the only thing that didn't impress at this hotel. It wasn't bad, but not worth the money they're charging, and there a lot better…"
 February 2017,5,Just what you expected,"Very well known upscale hotel in the movie-making city of Ouarzazate. There are various props scattered about (Egyptian throne, chariot, etc.), in case you need to be reminded. Rooms (most or perhaps all) are in semi-detatched ""villas"" and have small (very small) outdoor terraces with a table and one or two chairs. Ours was living room and bedroom, with separate temperature controls. All clean, well kept, very comfortable--just what you've probably heard it is. Dining room serves buffet, and food is good, with lots of choice. No complaints at all."
 February 2017,4,Best in town,"I had a beautiful suite, room 45 I think. Very spacious, very clean, good service. Dinner was a little weak. Didn't like the person who seemed to be in charged. Breakfast on the other hand was surprising very good. What do you want, it's Ouarzazate, not Fes. Would definitely go here again."
 February 2017,5,Lovely and fun,"This is a lovely large hotel that offers a boutique hotel feel. The rooms are large, very clean and comfortable with extra touches like fresh fruit and flowers. Wifi is quick and reliably good, hot water is fast and plentiful, beds are comfortable with soft pillows and rooms have all the luxuries of the best hotels. The decor is modern but still has Moroccan touches and a Moroccan movie feel since there are items from movies made in Morocco displayed throughout. Breakfast is great with much more than the usual items. I especially enjoyed the fresh crepes. Dinners are also buffet style with a big selection, good flavors and with incredible deserts. The staff is friendly and it is a great place to stay."
 February 2017,3,Not my stle,"We were 2 couples on our way back to Marrakesh from the desert. From the outside the hotel looks good, but I must say the rooms were cheap looking and feeling. Getting in and out of tub to shower was an accident waiting to happen. The food was served buffet style for breakfast and dinner and I thought it was lousy quality food compared to other hotels in Morocco. It seems to cater to bus loads of tourists who don't care about food/room quality. The service, other than the bellmen was non existent. The problem is that there probably is not anything better in the area."
 February 2017,2,A very tourist and cheap hotel,"The entrance and lobby are nicer than the pictures they show but the hotel is a place for cheap caravans groups. We tried some cocktails by the pool as the pool bar was very charming. That was a big mistake, the barmen were terrible and the prices were as high as in Marrakesh. My horrible margarita had only lemon and a drop of tequila, he forgot the rest. The dinner was in a dark depressing salon with hundreds of tourists fighting for the cheap food served on a buffet. It would be ok if they charged at least one third of their exorbitant price. I felt sorry for those who paid all inclusive and would have to return next night."
 February 2017,4,comfortable attractive tourist hotel,"There are many of this type of hotel in Morocco and this is a step above most. The rooms are large, comfortable and spotless, located behind the main building that holds the pool area and restaurant. Dinner is sometimes buffet sometimes ordered off a menu. Breakfast is a large buffet. The food is good, not great. The staff is very good and helpful."
 December 2016,5,Hollywood Oasis inside a Luxury Palace,"The Berbère Palace is the epitomy of Moroccan hospitality and luxury! It is located in the Hollywood Film making capital of Morocco -- Ouarzazate. We very much enjoyed the props from numerous movies located in the common areas. Check the throne of Cleopatra -- really a great movie props! The staff is very friendly and attentive focusing on providing guests with a great hotel experience. Special thanks go to Ahmed Ouabdi the Chef de Cuisine, Driss M Bark, Oubdi Abdallah and Druss Agoujil. I love the Oasis pool including the infinity pool! Our room was a beautiful suite with all amenities included. It looked more like a private apartment than a hotel room! My son was absolutely delighted to have his own bedroom. The breakfast was exceptional with multiple stations…"
 January 2017,5,Lovely hotel in every way,"As one might expect in the film-making capital of Morocco, there are props from various movies positioned around the public spaces, which are appropriately grand and luxurious. Rooms are spacious and well-appointed, beds and linens are first-rate, walls are thick so tranquility reigns. Rooms can be a bit of a walk from the public areas but one can ask to be closer. The restaurant serves delicious fare and the breakfast buffet was excellent. Pool area is enormous and nicely appointed. All told a property that merits its fine reputation."
 January 2017,5,The Magic of the Atlas and Movie stars ;),"Absolute luxury, all you need and some! Great service, very pleasant swimming pool area. Rooms are big, even the standards and all private spread through the gardens. Main building with restaurants, bar and amazing sculptures left by the producers of the movies made in the area! Well worth a visit!"
 January 2017,5,A combination of the Arabian Nights and Hollywood,"Wasn't that George C. Scott's line about Morocco [in his role as Patton]? Well, it surely applies to Le Berbere Palace -- the setting, the lobby decor--here in the heart of Mollywood. Excellent food and service, too. A thoroughly enjoyable stay."
 January 2017,5,When you want a little comfort....,"Ouarzazate was experiencing a sudden cold spell. We weren't prepared, so we were cold. And miserable, particularly because there were only cold showers in our previous hotel. At the Berbere Palace the rooms were warm, the showers were hot, and we were welcomed with fresh fruits and fresh lilies and roses. It improved our mood no end and we completed our trip to Morocco with pretty positive impressions."
 January 2017,5,Wonderful Hotel,Stayed here with group and it was wonderful! Everything all the reviews say are true and I cannot find fault with anything. Restaurants are very nice with wonderful food and service. Beautiful setting and the rooms are large and comfortable.
 January 2017,5,Top of its Class in Morocco,"After spending three days camping in the Sahara two nights at the Berbere Palace was sheer luxury. After the Casablanca Hyatt Regency, this was the nicest place we stayed in 3 weeks touring Morocco. Staff is professional, courteous and efficient. Wifi worked perfectly. Beds were comfortable and the linens freshly laundered and pressed. Room heat worked well. The split bathroom was convenient and the decor beautiful. Nice bathroom amenities and plenty of hot water. Two English news channels on the TV. Lovely decor. The grounds are huge and make for a nice evening walk. The bar/lounge is comfortable and true to its billing as a movie industry center there were a group of men in the lounge discussing the next day's film shoot and whether they could land a helicopter in…"
 December 2016,5,Great place to stay,"We spend only one night at this hotel, but were overall positively impressed. Beautiful grounds, very elegant. The rooms are in bungalow style, with our bungalow having two rooms (living room & bedroom - TV in each room), a separate bathroom (bathtub was somewhat slippery and narrow) and WC. Wifi didn't work well in our room. Breakfast was plentiful; egg station available. Dinner (buffet) at the restaurant was plentiful and tasty. Vegetarian options available. Wine bottle costs 205 Drh., can be served outside bar for those who want to smoke (but no indoors smoking place, so it can get quite cold - hotel could consider adding some form of heating there). Across the hotel there is a minimart. You can walk to the town center in about 10 mins. (seems safe). Local shops &…"
 January 2017,4,Great hotel,"This is a fabulous luxury hotel. There is a movie memorabilia theme in the public areas which is interesting. There is a great pool area which would be terrific in warm weather. The rooms are modern and well appointed. Our only two small issues were that the reverse cycle air conditioners were very noisy ( and it was a cold night) and one of our two rooms had a cigarette smell, not bad, but noticeable. Wifi is good and fast We had dinner in the oasis restaurant, which was very good and the service was excellent. They have an interesting and extensive mix of Italian , Moroccan and French food. Buffet breakfast with an omelette bar also very good. Excellent place to stay."
 October 2016,5,Luxurious Accomodations with a Movie Bent,This is a top-notch hotel that has a long association with films made nearby. Everything is first-class from the spacious suites to the extensive meal buffets with fresh squeezed juices and items made to order. It's fun to walk around the property and see the memorabilia from movies that provides great photo opportunities. The setting is beautiful with multiple gardens and a lovely pool. We enjoyed a hammam at their spa that was well-done and reasonable. I would return here in a heartbeat.
 November 2016,5,An Oasis inside a palace,"This is truly a 5 star hotel. The Berbere Palace compound is hugh. The lobby of the hotel is large & beautiful. It is filled with large memorabilia statues from movie sets. The decor is very nice. Our room was a suite, which comprised of two nice size rooms. There was a safe & a small frig, a nice large bathroom with a tub. The breakfast buffet was the best & most extensive of any we have encountered in Morocco. Eggs & omelettes to order plus an extensive display of bread, pastry. You name it they had it. The dinner buffet was also very good & quite extensive. My wife & I had a massage which we needed after our camel ride a few days ago. The massage was great. The infinity pool is large & beautiful. The staff was very friendly & helpful. We needed a pharmacy on a Sunday & Ascede…"
 October 2016,5,Wonderful place to stay,I stayed for one night. Very nice hotel with a lot of memorabilia from the movies filmed in Morocco. Very nice rooms which are large and comfortable. Nice comfy bed. Bathroom is nice and clean. Rooms are spread out so involves a lot of walking. Wonderful restaurant and good service. Both breakfast and dinner are good.
 September 2016,5,Luxury at the edge of the desert,"Spacious cottage type room with all one could require, awesome food, spectacular pool and spa all sitting on the edge of the Sahara. After spending the day out in the desert in a four wheeler it was a dream come true to have a room here to return to."
 October 2016,5,Beautiful Hotel,"You have to walk a bit to get to your room and we got a suite...the room is cozy and comfortable, and the bathroom is a treat. The hotel is nice and quite. The room was a bit too cold and we had an issue trying to adjust the AC. The bathroom was a nice treat after being on the road. The food was ok, but not too many choices but it's comfortable and modern. We got the best surprise after breakfast with so many birds on the trees humming away...it was music to the air......"
 October 2016,4,Spoilt by the little things,"We stayed here for one night during our tour of Morocco as there was a late change of town to stop at one day. This is a very well appointed hotel. The rooms are good sized, with separate bedroom and sitting room and a well appointed bathroom. It was a shame that there were a few niggles to take the edge off the experience of staying here. Surprisingly, there was no room safe. Trying to make an international telephone call was fraught with problems (although it was eventually achieved). At dinner, whilst eating my dessert, I had hardly placed my last forkful of food on my mouth when the waiter snatched my plate from in front of me! Dinner was a buffet style. There was plenty of choice and the food was good quality. Particular mention should be made of the roasted 'half lamb'…"
 October 2016,4,Very nice hotel in the center of the city,"Hotel Le Berbere Palace feels like a luxury American hotel in a Moroccan city and feels geared for American tourists, but with a Moroccan style. We enjoyed sitting in the pool and outside bar area. The restaurant that came with our tour package was all buffet, which we felt was meh, but the food was fine. The room was very pleasant (yay for adequate outlets!) and quiet. My only complaint was with the WiFi, which was very flaky in the room. The techs haven't figured out how to get a decent signal or have a single zone, so when you move from room to pool to lobby, you have to reconnect to different zones. But that is a minor complaint. Getting a taxi to go out at night was not a snap because there is limited traffic past the entrance, but wasn't too bad. We arranged with…"
 October 2016,5,Great hotel,"I was there in October of this year, while taking a tour around the country. It was such a pleasure to arrive to this hotel, it is comfortable, beautiful, filled with gorgeous details such as the mosaics, nice rooms, great breakfast and dinner buffets. Truly a rest for the weary traveller, fully recommend it."
 September 2016,4,Wish we had more time at the Berbere Palace Ouarzazate,"Unfortunately we had little time here but wish we had more time to utilise all the facilities. This is a really nice place with plenty of facilities to enjoy. The rooms were beautiful, bathroom spacious, room service very generous, breakfast lovely, outlook over the pool very pretty"
 October 2016,5,A genuine palace!,"The A-listers of the cinema scene stay here. Beautiful grounds, lovely spaces, and sumptuous rooms--with a plate of fresh fruit and some bottled water. Great meals and attentive dining room service. We hated to leave."
 September 2016,5,Step Into The World of Aladdin and Ali Baba!,"A very elegant, rich atmosphere. An unexpected, pleasant surprise for lodging after three nights in the Sahara Desert. You feel like you're going back in time when sultans ruled and riches flowed. Sheherazade would not have had anything on you!"
 December 2015,5,A good stop between the Sahara desert and Marrakesh,"After a long and tiring drive, coming from the Sahara desert, it felt like an oasis to stop for one night at the Hotel Le Berbere Palace. Without exaggeration, the buffet dinner we had here was the best during our two-week tour throughout Morocco. Do not forget to taste the area's dates. The hotel rooms were comfortable, but some of them were kind of distant from the lobby."
 October 2016,5,"Very comfortable room, excellent food","I stayed here two nights in a single room with an Overseas Adventure Travel group. One night we had the buffet dinner, which has several stations (appetizers, dessert, a huge line of steam trays with different types of cuisine, etc.) The quality is impressive considering the number of people they're serving and the desserts are particularly delicious. The breakfast buffet features yummy fresh-squeezed orange juice and a lady making omelets to order. The rooms are spread out among several ground-floor wings. The walk to your room is pleasant due to the orange trees, palms, and other landscaping. Two rooms are off each entrance; the only time I heard any noise, other than the air conditioning (which is often a bit loud) was when those across from me put luggage outside their door.…"
 September 2016,5,Style & Luxury,"We stayed here for one night as part of a tour group, but we wished it could have been longer. The hotel is a large and sprawling property, with a desert / movie theme. Being at the center for Moroccan film making, there are movie props throughout the extensive main building. It is an impressive property, and one that we wished we could have explored more fully. Everyone in our group was assigned suites, which were either two bedroom on the second floor, or one bedroom with enclosed courtyard on the ground floor. These suites were very spacious, clean and well appointed. Although the separate bathroom and shower rooms were a little small, given the large area of the suites, we were quite happy with the accommodations. Given the huge size of this hotel, some rooms could be a…"
 September 2016,5,Lovely hotel in the desert!,"The room was really great, lovely comfortable bed, good bathroom looking out onto a very pretty garden. The food was also very good, and the pool area is wonderful. We were only there for 1 night, but it was a very good night!"
 September 2016,5,Wonderful resort,"We stayed here 2 nights after our Sahara camp- so nice for a little luxury after ""roughing it"" in the desert. Nice town, good food with a definite french menu. The pool was perfect, the decor is a little different, focused on movie props, in keeping with the motion picture industry of the town."
 September 2016,5,Great to be back at the Berbere Palace...!!,"Really looked forward to returning to this hotel, having worked in Ouarzazate a few times before and this place was always a pleasure to stay in. From checking in onwards, staff are friendly and helpful in a charming older style, it's very pleasing. The room was excellent, comfortable and spacious, just as I remember them. After long days working, a meal on the terrace by the pool was always looked forward to, a good menu and attentive service made this a great base for extended stays. My last visit here, I felt that this was a great hotel... I'm pleased to say that, 8 years on, I think it still is..! Many thanks Berbere Palace, I had a great visit...!"
 September 2016,3,Rude and expensive.,"The Berbere Palace Hotel is a very well appointed hotel with fine architecture, good clean rooms, a beautiful swimming pool and lounging area and with very nicely landscaped grounds. Altogether these ingredients should make for a very pleasant stay, but unfortunately two factors mitigate against this. 1. The reception staff exhibit personality issues that suggest that they they think they might be in the employ of the Gestapo. The first words that I was greeted with were "" What is your name, give me your passport."" They were consistently rude and unhelpful until my departure. It's like they get too much business to be bothered being nice. 2. The price of buying anything in the hotel is beyond real. A small bottle of Heineken is €6 for example, I think that most guests here only…"
 September 2016,5,Great oasis in the northern Sahara.,Great location in Ourarzazate. Great hotel in a sprawling complex. If booking a room ask for it near reception an it took me 10 mins to find it on arrival. Great pool area and good food. Staff very obliging and looked after me well as I had a tummy bug. Good gluten free options as well. Prices quite reasonable as well. Highly recommended.
 July 2016,5,Beautiful Hotel !,"We stopped at this hotel on our way to "" Merzouga "" and on our way back to Marrakesh! from the reception all the way to the waiters everything was just great and beyond expectation! The pool is by far one of the best pools we enjoyed in Morocco ."
 June 2016,5,"Great rooms, great food","We had a lovely suite. The bed and bath were very good. It was quiet and clean. Breakfast was excellent. The staff was great. It was fun to look at the ""artifacts"" from different movie sets from nearby movie sets. Overall, a very good experience."
 July 2016,5,Exceeded expectations,The suite was nicely appointed and spaceful. Bath products were abundant and of good quality. It has different restaurants and being able to have dinner and breakfast by the pool is lovely. Dinner was excellent. Staff extremely helpful. A real palace in Erfoud
 July 2016,4,Would rate this 4.5 (very good<x<excellent) if it were possible,"This was a great hotel. Everyone we dealt with, from bellhop to reception to dining staff and housekeeping, were friendly and showed great customer service. The property is beautiful, the complementary toiletries were top-notch. I only subtracted half a point because my room wasn't spotless (though this property was MUCH cleaner than many of the ""5 star"" hotels we stayed at throughout Morocco). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
 June 2016,4,"Beautiful hotel, some glitches, honest staff","This hotel is one of the most beautiful I have stayed in from the standpoint of the physical property, with a large pool, gorgeous landscaping, movie memorabilia as part of that since Ourzazate accommodates a lot of international film crews. My room was beautifully done. However there were some glitches. The hammam was a bit on the expensive side for Morocco and the attendants were not all that friendly. The room safe didn't work very well, and I was unable to drain the bathtub at one point. There could be better (or maybe just more) towels. The buffets for breakfast and dinner were good but I think could be better (especially in the morning). Staff was sometimes helpful, sometimes curt. However -- and this is a big however -- I left a makeup bag with medications in it…"
 May 2016,4,Film industry personnel abound,The hotel is home to many of those in the film industry who shoot in and around Ourrzazate on location or at one of the film studios. You are sure to run into them at the pool trying to get some much needed rest after a long day or night of filming in the desert. The hotel is a wonderful respite from the daily grind for anyone. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. I had a junior suite which included a separate sitting room as well as a private enclosed terrace. The grounds are beautifully landscaped and there is art work throughout the property. The breakfast buffet is enormous with probably some of the best waffles I've had in all my international travels. Definitely worth a stay if you are in the area.
 May 2016,5,Exotic Hotel in Desert,"From the time you enter the lobby until you leave, you will be very happy. The rooms are great and outside of the main lobby. We ate lunch by the pool and it was delightful. Breakfast and dinner were excellent and the artwork in the lobby was fascinating to look at."
 May 2016,5,Escorted tour,A sumptuous grand establishment almost out of a movie set. The pool provided welcome relief after sightseeing. A long walk to my room but enjoyed the garden and perfume. All in all my two day stay was memorable.
 June 2016,5,An Oasis,"A short business trip to Ouarzazate was made memorable with a stay at this hotel. It's not cheap. It is special. Rooms are bungalows or suites. The pool area is really good - clean, cool and a refreshing break from the sun. Staff are incredibly friendly. Highly recommended."
 June 2016,4,Stunning pool and resort has a wow feeling,We were here as part of a globus tour. Hotel is on w large parcel of land allowing most rooms to be on the same ground level. Lobby was impressive and the gardens were nice. Had lunch In the cafe. Had a pizza and spaghetti with mince and 2 cokes for 200 dh. Food and service were good. Had dinner in the restaurant which was s Buffett. Great selection of foods. Highlights were the desert bar and variety of hot meals. All tasty. Nice pool. A little crisp but surely does cool u down from the hot sun. Ifu need water or snacks there is a little store outside the hotel and across the road. Large water only 7 dh and coke 14 dh. The hotel ties into the movie set Overall a good stay. Beds clean and comfortable. The bathroom works well but it is a bit dated
 April 2016,5,A true Oasis.,A large hotel with modern rooms and a moroccan design. The room was very comfortable and clean. The buffet dinner and breakfast was one of the best we experienced during our three weeks stay in Morocco. There are many movie props throughout the hotels main building. The pool area was very nice and the service was good. The hotel seemed very busy.
 May 2016,4,Great pool-area,Stayed at this hotel twice and would book it again if going back to Ouarzazate in the future. The poolarea is amazing and great for hanging out. Thats definitely the best thing about this hotel. The rooms are a bit old but keeps still keeps a good standard. And its clean and nice. The food is so so. Eat at the french bistro opposite of the hotel instead.
 April 2016,4,Elegance in the desert,"It was only one night stay - sadly I missed enjoying the pool and relaxing courtyard experience. But it was lovely at night. The hotel is decorated with statues and furnishings from film sets which adds an unusual and exotic feel. Rooms were like an apartment, very comfortable and spacious."
 May 2016,5,Superb Hotel,We stayed here one night. We were in a villa with 2 bedrooms one bath. Property is very nice. Surprisingly lunch at the hotel restaurant was very delicious and reasonably priced. Good breakfast. You really can't go wrong here.
 May 2016,4,Wonderful !,"Peaceful, serene hotel with small groups of rooms set in individual buildings in a garden-like setting with orange trees and lush greenery. Hotel is filled with items from Egyptian movie sets, filmed in the nearby studios. Absolutely beautiful pool and terrace area with attentive service both there and in the restaurant. Highly recommended !!"
 May 2016,5,Magestic comfortable and top luxury,Although I arrived late and left early I got a glimpse of this beautiful hotel. To walk to the room I walked outdoors for about 4 minutes. Its almost like a mini village. Every room is like an apartment on its own. The beds are extremely comfortable and the theme in the lobby has a lot of artifacts from famous movies that were filmed in the region. The staff is beyond amazing. I would love to come back to enjoy more this Berber gem.
 April 2016,4,2 night stag,"I stayed at the Berbere Palace after the Marathon des Sables and it was a lovely place to rest up. Food was wonderful and the breakfast had everything you could wish for. Lounging by the pool with a bottle of Casablanca beer was just what you needed. The rooms were a little bit tired but better than I had anticipated. Clean and very comfortable and all the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. The area around the swimming pool is wonderful for chillaxing. I didn't get to see much of Ouazazate (blisters prevented much moving around) but what I saw was a lovely , clean , fresh city and would love to visit again."
 May 2016,5,Very lovely hotel that lives up to its reputation.,"Reportedly the place is favored by stars when staying in town to make films here in the Hollywood of Morocco. It is a spreading campus with a nice pool area, very nice buffet restaurant with wide range of choices (and 2 additional restaurants). Even the smaller rooms here have everything Inc good a/c. Wifi can be spotty. Grounds are beautifully landscaped and there are weird statues scattered about with info on the movie and director they are associated with."
 April 2016,5,Comfortable Hotel for our stay in Ouarzazate Morocco,We had a two room suite - large and comfortable. The town of Ouarzazate is a good stopping off point and seems to be clean and safe. The property was modern and the grounds were beautiful and well cared for. A full moon added to the beauty of the 'near dessert' setting.
 October 2015,4,A good hotel - dated but very comfortable,"We only stayed one night on route to the desert. It was a good hotel, pretty basic, but comfortable.The service was good, food was okay, pool looked good, and overall it was a nice hotel. We stayed mainly because it was close to some of the sites we wanted to see, but the sites can be seen in one day, so no more than one night in this area is needed. Our tour guide recommended only one night and that was perfect."
 April 2016,5,A great place to stay after the Sahara.,"Le Berbere Palace is a great place to stay after your Sahara experience. The rooms are terrific, very clean and comfy beds. The dinner buffet is also great. A great many choices. The breakfast buffet is also very good. The fresh orange juice machine is something to see in action. Ouarzazate is the location of many movies you have scene. The hotel has props from some of these movies around the hotel."
 March 2016,4,Pretty hotel with interesting artefacts,"We reached there after a long drive after spending a day in the tent in desert,so what we needed was a clean room ,hot shower and comfortable bed,and we got it all there.as lot of films have been shot in that area,they have made few sets and few statues and artefacts used in those films which makes it very interesting.buffet breakfast was very good,a very big spread but dinner was not very appetising.Italian restaurant served very big portions of food but not up to the mark.we had good service by the waiters.pool was very good,I would say the highlight of the hotel.lot of sitting areas."
 April 2016,3,Lovely hotel and facilities but let down by food and service,"The Berbere Palace provide lovely facilities and large suite rooms. The pool is lovely and there are lots of places to sit outside, both in the sun and shade, from chairs to day beds to sunbeds, etc. Having spent 3 nights in Marrakech with outstanding service, we were disappointed not to find the same level here. The service was efficient and helpful when asked but not forthcoming. The restaurant is buffet style and the food was pretty poor, especially for a 5 star hotel. The wifi was very intermittent."
 April 2016,3,Meh,"I arrived here after spending a tough week running the Marathon des Sables. Whilst the hotel itself seems very good for the area I took an almost instant dislike to it because of the way i was treated , and it seems many other guests that weekend had the same treatment. The hot water is rarely available , the rooms have a sweet 1970s opulent grandparents feel, a few of our lights didnt work in the room and needed attention. The reception phone is never answered, the wifi is sporadic and unreliable throughout the hotel. The staff insist on you paying for all drinks and food etc by cash at the time giving you a 'petty criminal ' feel rather than a guest that can charge to the room. when you pay the frankly outrageous prices for beer and food the waiter assumes every time that…"
 April 2016,3,oasis,"After running 267km through the desert this was just what was required. Nice clean rooms and good food. fantastic pool. Let down buy expensive drinks, haphazard check in and having to pay every item by cash rather than charging to room."
 April 2016,4,"Beautiful hotel, with flaws","The lobby, swimming pool area, and rooms are gorgeous. We had a suite with a small living room, one bedroom with a huge bed and a second bedroom with twin beds. Unfortunately, after a long day of travel, we were not able to get anything more than a trickle of lukewarm water in the tub and the shower didn't work at all. Wifi was only available in certain places in the room and would go in and out. The restaurants were good though, with wine and beer available, and the breakfast was extensive."
 April 2016,3,Pretty Hotel with Unhelpful Desk and Spa Staff,"Traveled with a group around Morocco and stayed at this hotel for one night (April 7, 2016). Room was very nice and spacious -- two bedrooms (one with two twins, one with king), living room (couch, TV), bathroom (shower, sink, bidet) and separate room with toilet. Had breakfast and dinner at hotel, which was good, and drink at pool bar. Servers were attentive. Down side was the front desk (not helpful with settling bill) and the spa. Why a nice hotel like this would offer this type of spa service is beyond me. No desk for reservations, and phone goes unanswered. Went down to make appointments and very brusque woman made appointment. Others in our group got no service at all. Would rate this hotel much higher if they could sort out the spa situation."
 April 2016,5,Oasis,These very comfortable rooms are clean and spacious. They are organised in groups of two and noise travels between the rooms. The tiled floors were clean and the breakfast both extensive and generous. The fresh omelette and the fresh crepes were particularly good.
 March 2016,5,Excellent Service and Comfort,"The Palace was great! I had a large suite with a separate living room, spacious bedroom, spotless bathroom and even a patio off the bedroom. We ate at the Italian restaurant and the main dining room and enjoyed caring service and good food choices. Very happy with this hotel."
 March 2016,3,Large hotel but with its faults,"Great place as such but it has too many faults to get a better rating I am sorry to say. Very lovely decore, everything about it is stunning, I personally liked the movie extras in there and thougth it was a nice touch to the place but at the end of the day, it was a bit of a eh, well, experience. Brought on mostly by the staff at the hotel, perhaps after all the personal attention at the riads, this hotel and it is a hotel, let me down. From the minute we checked in to the minute we checked out, the staff at the front desk was rather offish, I was more of a pain for just checking in and checking out, then a valued client. They were very impatient and very slow with all the people in the back of me, yes, just not even professional for a large hotel in this country. They charged…"
 February 2016,1,Unsafe!,"Here as part of a group tour of Morocco. Husband slipped and fell in shower, effectively ruining much of the remainder of the trip. Bath was updated, had a clear plastic surround on one side that was not clearly marked as movable, and when hand placed on it, swung out, so that he fell. Had to be taken by special driver for medical attention. Hotel aware of situation, but did not offer any assistance or comments. Slip hazards need to be clearly identified and remedied!"
 July 2015,5,So Beautiful...,"An absolutely luxurious hotel! The hotel itself is breathtaking, staff was courteous and our experience pleasant. We enjoyed our meals and we took advantage of the beautiful gounds and pool. We loved our room as it was quite spacious and very clean, we also quite enjoyed the fact that we had our own little private patio. Wifi was included in our stay. We would definitely return."
 September 2015,5,Unbelievable Hotel,"When we rolled off the hot and dusty highway into Ouarzazate, we were not expecting a hotel that was this luxurious. It is so beautiful to look at. The pool and cabanas were just were we needed, The staff was so helpful, the so bartenders so gracious, the food so delicious, and the rooms so comfortable. I would recommend the Hotel Le Berbere Palace to anybody."
 December 2015,3,"Pleasant, large hotel","This is a pleasant, large and impersonal hotel. The decor is a over-the-top featuring film studio props. The hotel is spread over well manicured grounds. Our room was on the first floor and dark since one had to keep the blinds closed for privacy. My one caveat is that you should not eat here (breakfast buffet excepted). We ate dinner here and it was dreadful!"
 December 2015,5,Good stay,"Good hotel, nothing much around and away from crowded area. They had all the three restaurant hotels opened and fortunately I could get to eat some vegetarian food. everything is nice. You can relax in the bar after a long day outing around ouarzazate."
 December 2015,3,Service leaves a bit more to be desired,"Stayed one night in Dec 2015. Reception staff was a bit indifferent, and didn't provide any explanation about our stay - I had to ask him if wi-if was available, what the code was, where and when breakfast will be served, etc. Rooms were spacious but a bit dark and air conditioning was not strong enough to heat the entire room. We ordered the harira and kefta tajine for dinner which were both absolutely delicious. Breakfast was average. All in all not bad but wouldn't put it alongside other 5 star hotels I've stayed at."
 November 2015,5,Luxury in the Desert,"This was our only night in Morocco in a ""regular"" hotel - the rest were riads and tents. The hotel is luxurious and frankly reminded us of many of the hotels in Scottsdale, Arizona. Our room required a good walk from the lobby but it was a two-room suite with all the luxury and amenities one would expect in a 5-star hotel. The theme of the hotel is the movie industry and there are posters and memorabilia from the various movies filmed in the area. Many/most of the actors and film crews stay at this hotel so it is definitely upscale. We arrived late and left early so didn't really get to enjoy the hotel that much.. The included breakfast was phenomenal with extensive choices. The fresh orange juice machine was the best."
 October 2015,4,A good base,"There's not a lot going on in Oarzarate itself, but it's a good home base from which to explore the huge oasis, movie studios, Ksar Ait Ben Haddou (a World Heritage site,) and a day trip to Zagora to see the sand dunes. Our room was large and comfortable with a nice seating area and a separate bedroom. Unfortunately, the seating area smelled like smoke much of the time as the guests next door puffed up a storm. The hotel's dining room has a huge and varied buffet; an excellent staff and delicious fresh picked and squeezed orange juice for breakfast. The various movie props and posters from films shot in the area add a fun note to this solid hotel."
 September 2015,5,A little out of the way,This is actually a beautiful hotel in the middle of nowhere. I don't mean to say it is out in the country but there is limited shopping close by. Most of it is closed in the afternoon. There is one good store across the street to the right but that is about it. There are only a few restaurants close by but not many. the food was acceptable and the villa type unit I had was clean and modern with a good bed. WiFi worked in the room. English is so so with the staff. Where the really shone was I had a medical issue and the front staff called a taxi and told him what I needed. The cab went to great lengths to get me my pills (you can guess why!) and the bill was only about two Euros although I paid him in his currency. That was both ways to the drug store and waiting for me. When we…
 October 2015,4,big chain hotel- little charm and empty - helpful staff,huge hotel at odds with everything else we had experienced in morocco - but very helpful staff - rather tired food - as hotel seemed empty - 247 rooms but only about 10 people eating in restaurant big rooms and quiet full of film set extra parts-
 October 2015,5,Base for trip to desert,"The overall setting was quite nice. Closeness to the airport is excellent. Only problem is that the rooms, especially the second bedroom were very poorly lit including the bathroom making it difficult to get dressed except in very broad daylight."
 October 2015,5,Exotic Luxury,"We stayed here for a night during a tour of Morocco. The whole ambiance is one of exotic luxury, and this extends to the rooms, most , if not all are ground floor, set in a garden with large areas for relaxation. The rooms are large and comfortable. There is excellent free wifi. The staff are competent, although there can be some language difficulties.. All in all, a very nice place to stay."
 October 2015,5,THE Place to Stay in Ouarzazate!,This place has undergone a face lift and it looks great! The rooms are quite large and very comfortable. The garden setting is delightful. The pool is amazing! The food is just so-so. The wi-fi works well in some areas; not so great in others. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in the area.
 October 2015,5,Great hotel,"Lovely, clean, hospitable place. Rooms are nice but can be a hike from the registration area. Very quiet. Breakfast is amazing! Great selection of just about everything. Fresh juices, yogurt, cereals, cheese, bacon, sausages, baguettes, sweet pastries and an omelet station. After having traveled in a Muslim country for three weeks, it was nice to be able to make a ham sandwich for breakfast. They also have a bar if needed. All in all, a good stay."
 June 2015,5,Another Centre for Relaxation,"We stayed one night at this hotel as part of our Moroccan tour. The hotel was very comfortable with a great pool which was a major attraction for us Kiwis. We enjoyed our time here. The rooms were comfortable, clean and the air conditioning worked well. The service from the staff was very good"
 September 2015,3,Nice property but terrible service!,"Stayed here recently on a tour. One of four hotels that we stayed and definitely the worst. The property itself is lovely, beautiful pool, good size accommodation totally let down by the poor staffing and service. Our party had 12 rooms between us and every room had problems, safes did not work, missing robes, our mini bar was empty, we had a fruit bowl with no fruit, light bulbs broken. The staff on reception were rude and dismissive, the waiting staff inattentive and badly trained. It could be a great hotel but needs better management. In comparison our other hotels were superb."
 September 2015,5,Hidden Oasis!,"What a hidden gem after a long drive from the desert!! This place was fantastic and exactly what we needed after camping in the desert :) The rooms are BEAUTIFUL and spacious. The pool scene is fantastic and they have some great hotel cats that were fun!! The food wasn't something to write home about, but they had a very large menu and the service was superior. Thanks for a great stay, I would recommend this to anyone passing through!"
 September 2015,5,An oasis in the desert.,Do yourself a favour and take your swimmers. Enjoy a dip in the beautiful pool and a cold drink around the pool from one of the friendly staff after a long day of touring. Don't forget to check out the movie memorabilia that is all around the complex.
 May 2015,4,Hang Out with the Stars,"Very nice accommodations, nice dining and a large pool. Buffet dining with a large selection of salads and entrees. Cocktails can be ordered around the pool and wine with dinner. Many artifacts from movie sets filmed in this film capital of Morocco. A large selection at breakfast."
 April 2015,5,stayed for a few nights after the marathon des sables,"great hotel, lovely staff and has a real old world french style and charm that I thought no longer existed. Very professional staff especially those in the restaurant. Did I mention great food and a very relaxed dining experience? Not stuffy but very professional. Nice rooms and welcoming reception area. The outside bar and swimming pool area is great, very relaxing. Used the spa and there is a wonderful masseuse there who is brilliant. Will return one day for sure."
 August 2015,5,Worth it's luxurious status,"Ouarzazate is a city on the border of the Sahara Desert, with not much to do (except explore the nature by quads, buggies or visit the famous movie sets). Berbere Palace is a gem in the middle of nowhere with amazing suites. The luxury hotel is definitely worth it's overpriced stay. The room has absolutely everything a five star hotel can offer, with two large TV screen, one for the bedroom, another gigantic one for the spacious living room. The ambiance of the hotel is very cozy and welcoming. It can get a little dark and intimidating at night for certain guests to roam around the hotel, but being such a large hotel with a big pool and very tasty restaurant give it it's high ranking. The hotel has a pit stop with touches and pictures of different movie stars who lodged…"
 August 2015,5,"Desert location, but the hotel is top shelf","Located in the town of Ouarzazate, which is known as Morocco's Hollywood, this hotel provides lovely 'cottage rooms' for each guest. Our room had a king size bed, a sofa, chair, coffee table and desk. Internet was free and a bowl of fruit was provided on our coffee table when we arrived. Large tiled bathroom with bathrobes provided. Beautiful swimming pool with lounge 'beds' and chairs...gorgeous setting. An on-site casual restaurant serves lunch and dinner, but a more formal restaurant is also available for fine dining. Breakfast was included with our package and the chef prepared omelets to order. The wait staff was very accommodating. Nearby is Kasbah Taourirt, an historic site, that included an interesting tour by a local guide (available on site)."
 August 2015,5,An Oasis in the Desert,"This is the best of Ouarzazate. I stayed here 14 years ago. The only thing that changed is it is no longer a Sheraton. And I'm sure there is new paint since the building and grounds are spotless. This is the best hotel in town. It is well worth the price difference to stay here. I was upgraded since the occupancy rate is low (middle of the summer in the desert). The suit is beautiful, 2 big flat screen TV's, good wifi, and the bed is very comfortable. The restaurant is excellent. You have a choice of Italian, Moroccan, and international menus. I felt the price was very reasonable (steak for $15). The swimming pool area is lovely and I'm heading out there now. Au revoir"
 March 2015,5,The decor is out of a movie !!!,"A little expensive but it deserves, for all those visting ouerzazate if you're looking for the number one hotel in the area berbère palace is all what u need, a great swimming pool and the décoration is hilarious, just ask for guidance you might get lost looking for your Chambre at night ""this hotel is huge"""
 July 2015,4,Overpriced But Nice Stay,"This place is a real must if you love movies. While there, a Bollywood movie was being filmed and the place was full of actors and staff. On the night of the King’s 30th anniversary they hosted a dignitary part for the city. This is the best place to stay in the area. The price, however, is outrageous. We stay in a special two floor suite for over 5000 MAD for the night. Yes, it was nice, but those are European prices. They had all the VIP amenities you could want; pool, spa, restaurant, grounds, bar. The pool was large, but the Jacuzzi was small and dirty. The Spa had almost no services and was much smaller than the photos. Wonder if it was the same place. It is the best place in the city, but very expensive."
 July 2015,5,An oasis on the long journey from Merzouga to Marrakech.,"We spent three days in this beautiful hotel. The rooms were excellent- we got an upgrade because it was low season. We were given a two bedroom suite, (one extremely large bedroom with a huge double bed and a tv, the second, smaller, with two single beds ), a living area, also with a tv and a large bathroom and separate toilet. The air conditioning was really cold- perfect for the time of year. The pool was beautiful. Breakfast was excellent- one of the best I have seen, and the evening meal was good too. The staff were all really attentive and pleasant."
 March 2015,5,Amazing hotel!,"Wow what a beautiful hotel! I loved everything about it - the lobby, the bar, the restaurant, the room I had! It was too cold to use the pool but it looked amazing! The staff were very professional and courteous. Breakfast was fabulous! I wish I could have stayed here longer!"
 June 2015,5,The Sweetest Orange Juice,This was a very nice hotel. The rooms are spread out across beautiful grounds. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The towels were the plushest that I have ever used and the toiletries were jasmine scented. The wi-fi worked well. The pool was large and beautiful. The food in the included breakfast and dinner buffet was fabulous. The fresh squeezed orange juice at breakfast was the best that I have ever tasted. There was also a lot of delicious fresh fruit for breakfast. There was a wide variety of choices for dinner. The staff was attentive and friendly! I highly recommend this hotel.
 May 2015,4,Beautiful,"Yes, this is a palace. The main building is beautiful. Beautiful swimming pool. Great buffet breakfast. Only spent one night here. The bedrooms are detached from the main building. Ours' was a suite with a very small LR and king BR. Separate WC from bath. There was a very small patio that we did not use. The lobby is filled with Hollywood movie props and posters from movies filmed in the desert."
 June 2015,5,Great respite after the desert,We were hot and tired after our time in the desert and this hotel was a much needed find. The pool was wonderful and so was the pizza by the pool! The breakfast buffet included with the room was enormous and had the best homemade yogurt. Highly recommended if you are looking for a place to splurge for a night.
 June 2015,1,bugs in the beds,"we arrived into this town and previewed a few places to stay & thought that because of the pool area and the size of the rooms because there were 3 of us that this would be the best option , unfortunately we were very disappointed in this hotel .. it is a nice property and with a great pool area but my daughter was bitten in her bed while sleeping over 25 times by either mosquitos or something else and we had not left any windows open .."
 May 2015,5,Beautiful Hotel,The Berbere Palace is a marvelous hotel. It is spread out over a large landscaped area. Great pool area and restaurants. Our room was a large suite with a separate living room .... very modern ....very clean. The bathroom was large with a great shower.
 May 2015,4,The palace with ants! Great food in the dining room!,"After traveling all day on a tour bus and then walking to what seemed liked the outer bungalow room that we were assigned, we noticed the bedroom floor was covered in ants. I called the front desk and attempted to explain the problem. They sent out a woman who then swept the ants out of the room. This was unacceptable when bug spray was actually needed. I then went to the front desk and got another room assigned. Based on the overall number of ants in the room, it was quite obvious no one had been in this room for awhile. On a positive note, the grounds are very nice including the pool. The food (both breakfast and dinner) buffets were delicious and one of the few places in Morocco where I felt I could trust the overall quality in terms of food preparation including…"
 May 2015,5,Simply Gorgeous,"I stayed for one night in a beautiful suite at this gorgeous resort hotel. I wish my stay was longer. The suite was well-appointed, quiet, with comfortable bed. The sprawling garden areas are beautiful, with pool and lots of places to sit. The food is excellent, with a fantastic dinner buffet and very good breakfast with lots of fresh fruit."
 May 2015,4,Refreshing Change...,"My visit to Morocco included stays mostly in smaller hotels and guest houses where services were not overly extensive or broad. The Palace was a welcome change. It is a large hotel with lots of amenities and extra services. Various restaurants, large pool, spa, piano bar, etc. are available. I notice some of the reviews of this hotel mention poor service. That was not my experience as service for me was very acceptable. I do have one criticism of my room at this hotel....inadequate lighting. I found my room to be too dark and without ample lighting, especially after sunset. The bed was comfortable and they do offer room service for food, although I did not use it. This is a large hotel complex with rooms spread out over some distance. If walking is an issue for…"
 April 2015,5,Resort style hotel,"This is a very nice hotel which is sprawling and feels more like a resort than your regular Moroccan hotel. Consider this if walking is an issue as rooms are widely spread out amidst meticulously maintained grounds with orange trees, palms and rose bushes. Felt more like a resort in Scottsdale or Los Angeles specially with movie props as decorations. The rooms were well appointed and the beds were very comfortable. We had a problem when the toilet door got jammed but staff came and repaired it immediately. We had an excellent buffet for both breakfast and dinner with various options from Moroccan to more continental choices (including ham). Dinner buffet included sushi and various salads. Desserts were very good. The breakfast buffet was the most extensive one I had in…"
 March 2015,5,Quarzazate Beauty,"The is an opulent property, fitting for the town where many movies have been and continue to be filmed. The decor features the era of the movies throughout the public rooms and in the photos in the rooms. The rooms can be quite a distance from the public areas, restaurant etc., and from each other - a problem only if travelling with a party or group, or having an early departure. The room we stayed in was actually a suite, with a living room area between the bed and the bathroom. A large alcove to the left of the bathroom featured a massive cupboard. The bathroom was very modern, with many 'amenity' samples. Ditto, as other reviewers have noted, on the wizardry of the shower features. The large bed with fine linens and a flat screen T.V. contributed to the ambiance of the…"
 April 2015,3,Over the hill,This is a beautiful property which is trading on their old reputation. The service is poor and the food leaves a lot to be desired from a place that has this reputation. What a pity that they have not kept up their game! Checked into our room with a couple of bottles of water in our bags which we drank while staying there. Never opened the minibar or drank the complimentary water but had a real hassle on check out when we weber accused of drinking water from the minibar and had trouble convincing the front desk. They continued to want to charge us for water we had not drunk.
 March 2015,3,Would have been higher except for poor service,"The rooms were good, comfortable, clean and spacious. I was not thrilled about the shower not having a separate door, but the bathroom was otherwise well appointed. The public areas were so cool! I enjoyed looking at all the movie memorabilia. My one comment was that the dinner time in their restaurant was disorganized with the drink orders going to the wrong tables and an inability to keep orders straight. They need training."
 December 2014,4,Definitely a destination for movie buffs,This is a great hotel if you are fond of movies. Ourzazate is the Hollywood of North Africa and a lot of international films have been made in this town and the hotel is littered with some very interesting remnants of the sets used for the movies. Really extensive property which was a downside because we had 8 rooms spread across the property and it would take half an hour to find our way around and collect everyone in a central point. The food and service is old style French (I mean it in a nice way) and we enjoyed our eventful (albeit short) stay. Rooms are very nice although using the shower would require you to take a course on using complex gadgets.
 August 2014,4,Supreme in its class,"The hotel rooms are comfortable, the most rooms are very big and have a good strengst WiFi signal, only downside is that the shower does not have a seperate door. There is a seating room With small tv in front of the bed. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful decorated with filmmaking attributes, typical for this area. Like almost everywhere theres a rather big swimming pool. The sauna is in poor condition resulting that is not used very Often."
 April 2015,1,Very bad experienceMefiez vous des serveurs,"We've been spent a very bad periode in there from 10/04/2015 to 13/04/2015... Despite the place and the rooms are wonderful,we experienced the worst stay in a very beautiful city like Ouarzazate -bad reception with no orientation -Neither the waiters have a sense of orgnisation in their work(old clothes) nor they smile (They need some smiling lessons) .. also they insoled us. -very bad food compared to a 5 stars Hotels ( like Marrakech..Agadir) -Noises in the morning caused by working stuff -waking up at 6h00 by a mistaken call from the reception.:: no aplogizing -A waiter had insolted us and he didn't even apologize...after a big fight with them..there is no respect (Discrimination against Moroccans). To Sum up : you can choose an Inn (Auberge) IN the sides would be better…"
 April 2015,3,Beautiful hotel with terrible service,"The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are great and so is the food. The service is very poor though; slow to serve, wrong orders, even slower to clear plates away etc, the lowlight been ordering a couple of beers which went to the wrong table, we pointed this out to then be given the same bottles despite the previous table having drunk some....disappointing as the hotel is lovely."
 March 2015,5,"Expansive hotel, quite posh","Quite an up-scale hotel with expansive lobby, bar and swimming pool/sun deck area. The layout is garden lanes to cottage type clusters of rooms. I like the rooms, good size, well furnished, clean, contemporary, quiet. Staff helpful as I had to put the heat on in my room. Unfortunately too cold to swim. Good selection at breakfast in large dining room. This hotel has movie props from famous films in the extensive lobby. Its really a very western hotel experience dressed with memorabilia from the Moroccan film industry. However, stay very pleasant and comfortable."
 March 2015,5,Luxurious,"This hotel provides a level of service we found no where else in Morocco staying at 5 star hotels as part of our tour. Our suite had a large bedroom, a large sitting room, a separate room for the toilet and a bathroom. Everything from the grounds outside to the room inside was spotlessly clean, the shower worked, the electrical wiring made sense -- who could ask for more from a Moroccan hotel? The lobby is fun, filled with old movie props. My only complaint is that the t-shirts sold in the gift shop were sized way too small. The breakfast was excellent as well with fresh squeezed juice from their own oranges."
 March 2015,3,Comfortable but unexceptional stay,"My husband, 18 year old son and I stayed overnight in mid March. It was a pleasant stay but unremarkable. Although the facade of the hotel looked like a beautiful kasbah from the exterior and the lobby was pretty, the rooms were a disappointment after our exotic stay in a Riad in Marrakech.The rooms were comfortable, soundproof and spacious. However the decor was bland and uninspiring. The tiles in the bathroom were stained-at first I thought there were blood stains, but realized they must be either paint or nail polish stains-not dreadful, but the look was really unappetizing.To be fair, we booked the least expensive rooms, however cleanliness should be the gold standard no matter what the room category. While we did not take the suites normally booked by the movie stars, I did…"
 March 2015,4,"An old establishment, may be the nest hotel in the area.","We had an over night stay at this hotel. The rooms are spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom are all functional. From the fixtures, you can tell this hotel had seen its glamorous days for the movie sets. There are three restaurants: Italian, French and Moroccan. The breakfast buffet provides ample choices. Services were very good throughout. It you need to spend a night in this area, you cannot go wrong with its accommodations. Its history with many of the movies that were shot in this town does make it more interesting."
 March 2015,5,Greatest service!,Outstanding dining service with superior traditional Moroccan food options-Abdoul Chajidi especially attentive to all our needs-the traditional menu the best-buffet good-our room lovely and spacious suite
 February 2015,5,Outstanding,"After traveling for over two weeks in Morocco, it was a relief to stay at Le Berbere. It was a clean, very spacious room where everything worked--plumbing, electricity, free WiFi, etc. The complex is beautiful and rooms well-appointed. The movie-set decor is fun. Buffet breakfast is by far the best I had in Morocco. The location is in walking distance to the old town area, although a bit circuitous."
 February 2015,5,"Movie-set decor, Art Deco","The hotel is gorgeous, especially around the pool area. We loved all the sculptures and artifacts from films as part of the decor, and the rooms in ""kasbahs"" surrounded by gardens. Our room on the first floor of the casa had a very good bed - but the lighting was too dim for reading or even using the safe. The living room lighting was also ridiculous; the room was good only for watching TV. We dined there for both dinner and breakfast, both very, very good buffets. 'Twas nice to have sushi (!) in the middle of Morocco as well as many French food offerings. At breakfast you could brew your own coffee to order. It is truly a hotel appealing to international tastes, and I would have enjoyed staying longer in a warmer month."
 January 2015,5,A restful night,"Quarzazate is Morocco's location for filming movies. Therefore, the theme in the reception area and lobby are movie props. The property is expansive, with rooms outside the main building in apartment style. There were two floors in our apartment, we had a lovely bedroom, living room, W/C, and bathroom. TV's were in 2 of the rooms. It would be a marvelous place to stay for a vacation, with several lovely outdoor sitting areas and another large beautiful pool area. It was quiet, staff was friendly. We thought the buffet breakfast was excellent...couldn't think of anything you could possibly want they didn't have. Omelets, to cereal, to hot dishes, to fresh squeezed OJ. There is a great French restaurant not far from the hotel!"
 February 2015,4,nice but has seen better days,The basic facility and grounds are very nice but seem a little run down and could use some updates. The pool area seemed real nice but we were there in February and could not really enjoy it. The buffet dinner and breakfast had a wide variety of good quality items but nothing seemed really outstanding. It is probably one of the best hotels in town but not in five star shape.
 January 2015,5,Movies and luxury,Movie set props litter the public areas of this luxury hotel. Our room was large and comfortable. The service was outstanding. The buffet breakfast was the best that we have had in Morocco. We would recommend it.
 January 2015,4,Great hotel with excellent service,"This hotel is rated as a 5-star and it does a good job living up to those expectations. Staff are very friendly and helpful from the moment you arrive until departure. The rooms are large, well lit and comfortable. Ample choices for meals if you choose to eat on site and both dinner and breakfast were a buffet, a real plus for those travelling with picky eaters (children). The only downside, and it was a minor one, is that our room had an outdoor only access and a set of very narrow stairs to enter with no landing at the top. This presented some difficulty navigating bags for three people however a very minor inconvenience. We highly recommend this hotel when visiting Ouarzazate."
 January 2015,5,My beautiful desert oasis,"Decadent breakfasts served by warm, friendly staff. A delicious pool, outdoor and bar area to relax in. A gorgeous bedroom with the biggest most comfortable bed I have ever slept in whilst away from home. For a while, this beautiful hotel has been my home away from home. I hope to be back again. I have loved every minute of staying here. Gina Bartholomew. Room 324"
 January 2015,5,Beautiful hotel,"The whole place seems to have had an update...lobby, restaurant, pool areas, spa...except the rooms....they still feel a bit outdated, specially the tub and showers. Great to be greeted with some fresh fruit in the room. Lots of options to choose from at the spa. Had an interesting new years eve ""party"" that ended at 1am (i am mexican and used to great parties, but I do understand that muslims are not exacly party people) Great breakfast buffet. Pleasant stay overall"
 December 2014,5,Beautiful hotel and grounds,"This elegant hotel contained lots of movie set memorabilia inside and outside. The pool area was very nice with lots of lounge chairs and shaded sitting areas. Most of the rooms are in 2-story buildings scattered around the property. The grounds are very large and although there were some directional signs for the rooms, several travelers in our group had to ask for help in finding their room. We had a very large suite with king-size bed, separate living room and a large bathroom. Breakfast was an immense buffet with made-to-order omelets, ham, bacon and lots of other selections (fruits, breads and a cappuccino machine)."
 January 2015,5,Beautiful grounds and rooms,"After I stayed at a variety of hotels that either didn't have hot water or heat, this hotel was like ""Ahhhhh"". I think I might've heard a choir when I walked in the room. The room was beautiful and the grounds are gorgeous! I wish I could've stayed here longer than just the one night I had. The restaurant is also amazing. Would definitely recommend it!"
 December 2014,5,Great value and comfortable,"Our suite here was spacious and well appointed, with huge bathrooms (which was very nice after spending a night in the sandy Sahara!). The staff was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast spread was amazing. The dinner is buffet style but actually quite good. Also, we traveled in December and it was quite chilly. While the heat was lacking at many other places we stayed at, we were able to get nice and toasty in our rooms here."
 January 2015,2,seriously not a palace,"We stay in this hotel for 2 nights, first the front desk is extremely arrogant and unfriendly negatif -they provide only two mini bottle of water for the entire stay seriously for this price they could provide you more water !!!! -the fruit basket is fill up with old fruit -the tv in the leaving room have a very bad quality -the room service take an hour to bring cold and very average food -the front desk dont react when you mention you dessapointement about your stay -is overprised 190 euro for one night -the spa employee are extremely unfriendly -the shampoo soap are not replace unless you ask -no sleeper and wardrobe -they mention balcony or terasse but we did have any in our room -don t look on the detail dirsty corner in the bathroom, smelly towel positive …"
 December 2014,5,Fun place to stay and explore,"This hotel has hosted many film crews due to its proximity to film studios and desert locations -- so it is chock full of statuary from film sets. It's fun to walk around its corridors and public rooms and see what's around the corner. It was too cold during our visit to take advantage of the nice pool area. Dinner was in a large dining room, divided up into many sections with a giant array of cheeses, desserts, hot dishes, salads, etc. Though I don't generally care for 'buffet dining"", this was actually very good. Service for wine and keeping the table spotless was quick and solicitous. Breakfast choices were unbelievable huge and delicious. Oddly, the entertainment was a live string quartet struggling with some Western classical music. We had wished they had broken out…"
 December 2014,4,A fine stay,A very nice albeit large hotel that is well appointed. Of particular merit is the food and dining experience. The Oasis restaurant offers a large and sumptuous spread (for dinner and breakfast) and the wait staff is extremely accommodating and very friendly
 December 2014,4,An Oasis after a day's filming in the desert,"I've stayed here four times when shooting in either the nearby studios or on location. After a dusty and hot day at work, the hotel is the perfect place to unwind. Yes, it's a little sad, and needs a spruce up, but it's a comfortable base where relaxation is the order of the day. (Try the massage!) The staff are all a bit gruff, apart from the Doormen, but if you accept that they are doing you a favour by being there, you'll be ok. The Dining room is very overrated, and most people eat across the road in the lovely french restaurant, where the service and food are exceptional. (I always make a beeline for it) Some rooms are a route march away, and on this last occasion I had the absolute furthest away from Reception, which was tedious if I forgot something as I was about to…"
 December 2014,5,Excellent!!,"I stayed here for 1 night during a tour of Morocco with OAT. The hotel, grounds and service are all wonderful. The movie props were interesting and unique for a hotel. The food and breakfast were superb. My room was quite large with a sitting area and huge, modern bathroom. Everything in the room was ""like new"". I wish I could have stayed longer."
 December 2014,5,Great rooms,"The rooms are individual suites, and beautiful laid out. Unfortunately we were on tour and for only one night at this location. Did not walk around the community but it did not appear as if restaurants grocery or other such accommodations were locally available."
 October 2014,2,In need of updating,"We stayed here for one night as a part of a tour. I suspect that it is a place to stay out of convenience. Firstly, we had a blackout that lasted for hours, not necessarily the hotels fault. We had a second blackout the next morning. The decor throughout the lobby is chintzy, from movie sets. It looks worn. The rooms have a mildewy smell but are roomy. We had a very trying incident with the wait staff in the buffet dining room. Our tour group was supposed to get water at hotels. As hard as we tried to explain this the point did not get across. The staff was downright hostile to us. I finally went to the front desk to resolve it. not my expectation!!"
 December 2014,4,Modern Hotel Spacious Rooms,one night as part of a OAT tour. This hotel was a modern surprise. My room was a suite with a large bedroom and sitting room. Both had flatscreen TVs. Fresh fruit was waiting in the room. The bathroom was modern would be where the tub is really slippery. Great service at the bar and the breakfast was excellent.
 October 2014,4,A Film Set Version of a Hotel for the would-be Jet Set,"Staying here is a slightly unreal experience. It is quite possible to rub shoulders with movie stars here. I saw Ben Kingsley in the lobby. The huge grounds are full of impressive props from the nearby studios, bringing Roman and Egyptian artifacts here and there that collide with the Moroccan ambiance. The rooms themselves are located in a sprawling maze where it is easy to get lost. If you can find your room, you will find it to be well appointed and comfortable, with a sitting area and a fruit basket. The restaurant, pool and bar are enormous and are wonderful places to socialize. You will have lots of stories to tell your friends about this place when you get home."
 November 2014,3,Unique Hotel in desert city,"Stayed at Le Berbere Palace one night as part of a luxury group tour. To me, the hotel has seen better days and is living on past reputation. It seems to be the only large hotel in Ouarzazate that I could see so is the only place a group could stay. The décor is flamboyant with large Egyptian statues and dusty, left-over movie props. The grounds and pool area were quite beautiful though and lively. The rooms are set about the grounds in 2-story ""villas"". Our junior suite was on the second story, up a very narrow and dark set of stairs. The suite had an unusable, tiny parlor (couch so hard you couldn't sit on it), but large, comfortable bedroom and separate toilet and sink area. Windows looked out to the next building about 10 feet away...so balcony was very unappealing. …"
 October 2014,4,"Very large comfortable rooms on a huge site, but highly variable service","This is an elegant hotel on a huge site, with lovely gardens and plenty of facilities: when we were there, for two nights, there were lots of film people, ranging from elegant (possibly) stars to scruffy film crew. Our stay didn't get off to a good start, as the first room we were allocated was covered in dust sheets as workmen were changing the furniture. However, one of the doormen saw the problem, went off and quickly organised another room for us. As it was mid-afternoon when we arrived and we hadn't eaten, we went to Tablapizza, by the pool. It was open and staffed, but we were told by the waiter that they couldn't do pizza! At that point a senior manager came past, and pizza suddenly became available again. The pizza chef appeared, and grumpily prepared our food: however,…"
 October 2014,4,Really nice stay,"Stayed at the Berbere Palace in Ouarzazate for 1 night. Compound is set out kind of like a maze of villas. We were at the end of a really long path and then found out we were upstairs - the stairs were REALLY narrow and steep, a real struggle to get 2 x 25kg suitcases up and then down again when we were leaving. Room was really nice though. It had a common living room area with lounge, tv and fruit basket, then there was one twin room and one huge master room with a huge king sized bed, tv, desk and wardrobe. The bathroom had a seperate toilet which is handy when everyone is busy getting ready. The pool area is magnificent! Just looking at the scene screams luxury!! We met Kelsey Grammar while we were there too! Very nice guy. Dinner and breakfast at the buffet were both…"
 December 2013,5,STUNNING,"What an incredible place! We stayed here for one night during a coach tour and it was beautiful. Vast grounds with heaps of lovely places to sit with a drink and just chat. The pools is massive and there is a great bar and restaurant to socialize in. We were there while they were filming the third season of Game of Thrones, so the place was bustling! The rooms are lovely, clean, large and comfortable. I wish we could have stayed longer. There are also a lot of props from films that have shot in Ouarzazate. The walk into town is about 15 minutes and I felt very safe on the streets at night. It's a different sort of town from the rest of Morocco and you can very clearly see the money that has gone into it from the film industry. I would LOVE to go back to this hotel."
 November 2014,5,A WOW place to stay in Ouarzazate,"Le Berber Palace! What a magnificent place! I was extremely impressed at this hotel which is one of the very finest in Southern Morocco. I very highly recommend it. My room had a king-size bed, a small closet, and a dressing table with large wall mirror. The bathroom had a large tub, sink and lots of amenities. There were lots of clean towels and a bathroom there. The commode was in a separate room. The included breakfast was served buffet style, and it was a fabulous feast. The entire hotel was large, modern, very clean, and had a friendly, helpful staff."
 October 2014,3,"Beautiful Grounds, Lots of Movie Glitz, Not Much Attention to Room Details","The spacious (and I mean SPACIOUS!) and beautifully landscaped grounds, huge outdoor seating areas, and movie props and paraphernalia are reasons enough to visit Le Berbere Palace. So is the dinner buffet. But if you want a completely functioning and well-maintained room, I would stay somewhere else. Many desert-themed films have been shot at Quarzazate, and the hotel houses many souvenirs from them, for example, posters, big statues, throne, chariot, and much more. Just across the road is a currently working movie studio, ECLA Studios. The big pool is sparkling and beautiful and surrounded by comfy cushioned chaises, umbrellas, even curtained canopied beds. There are many well-appointed indoor and outdoor areas to meet over a drink and pet one or more of the many roaming cats.…"
 November 2014,3,sterile rooms but huge,huge rooms though sterile-no warmth or style. buffet for dinner was mediocre at best though again there was lots of it. spa was strange: masseuse left mid massage then came back. also took a phone call! left the door open for most of the massage and there was only a small towel covering my backside. Ouarzazate is a film industry site and there were lots of actors around. also props from previous movies/tv shows. the grounds of the hotel are lovely.
 October 2014,4,not a 5 star hotel,"This would not be a five star hotel in many other places. To get to your rooms, you wonder around outside down the paths. There is an initial sign directing us and then no more. It was raining while we ran around searching for our room. If you have to walk outside a ways to get to your room, they should supply umbrellas (and have better signage or provide maps). Thank goodness the toilet was separate from the rest of the bathroom because the shower leak badly. The pool looked very nice although we did not have time to use it. The pieces from movie sets all over the lobby are fun and add a nice character."
 October 2014,4,Huge Hotel,"Convoluted pathways to our rooms made us feel as if we were in a hyper-modern medina. Typical of '5-star' third-world hotels the rooms were huge, the lighting barely existent and the shower funky.It sprayed outside the tub in 2 seconds. However, their breakfast was the best we had in a 2-week trip. The area is the center of film-making in Morocco and one of our group spotted Ben Kingsley in the lobby. It was also fun to see the studio with its 'Oscar' statues outside. We also saw some buildings where films were made, i.e. the room where the 'snake' scene was set from Young Indiana Jones."
 September 2014,3,Lacking character and good maintenance,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom ""superior"" room with separate living room. The size of the room was great, however, besides looking cheap and lacking character, one shower didn't work, the air conditioner has a timer and it shuts off in the middle of the night, and 3 light bulbs were burned out, making a dark room even darker. We tried calling the guest services but ""surprisingly"" the phone didn't work, after sharing our concerns TWICE the problems were fixed. On the positive side, the pool area was pretty and the food at the hotel restaurants was good with very reasonable prices."
 September 2014,5,My favorite place.,"The place is wonderful,the stuff of the hotel is very friendly.i have never seen a manager of a hotel going arround in the hotel all the time:the first one who will wake up ,and the last person who will go to bed:unbelieavable.i think passing by Ouarzazate in Morocco makes your trip extraordinary if you stay in Berbere palace hotel"
 October 2014,5,Elegant oasis for the beautiful people,"And for the not-so-beautiful, though you will run into movie stars looking just like you. Modern, European/Americanize hotel with large lobby, large pool (albeit frigid; why not heat it?), a plethora of mini suites with separate lounging quarters and large bedroom and modern bath. Why oh why, in a place as attractive as this does the water flow out of the shower and onto the floor because the glass partition is not long enough? Towels fluffy. Spa treatments. Good and reasonably priced massage at spa. My only regret: Not having hours and hours to enjoy the luxurious breakfast buffet, by far the best we experienced in Morocco. It is as if it is the one place that the French use of butter in croissant lives."
 October 2014,4,Great place to stay,"This building is Kasbah style with a great foyer stuffed with movie props. The rooms are set in fairly extensive gardens whic is a bit of a maze but very nice. Our room was spotless, bathroom a little dated, but spanking clean. The pool area, lovely with lots of seating. Dining area was nice, the staff were very helpful and friendly. The buffet food offering excellent. Great buzz around the place as film crews were staying there. Happy days!"
 September 2014,4,Loved the movie props,"Very pretty hotel. The pool area was quite lovely although the water was cold. For some reason, we were given a complete bedroom downstairs with a full bath and a living room and then a complete upstairs suite as well. Comfortable and spacious. In the middle of town but you didn’t need to go out at all. There were props from movies scattered all over the hotel which were fun. I’d stay there again. Note: as with most of the hotels lately, when I took a shower, there was water all over the floor as the glass enclosure piece isn’t wide enough. It was also easy to get lost in the complex as it was spread out quite a bit. Also note that when there are movies being filmed in the area, some of the filming crews and actors stay here. I was happy."
 October 2014,4,Very good hotel remodeling to regain greatness,"This, is like the last reviewer stated, is a palatial estate, with very nice gardens. The rooms are huge and all systems worked well. The a/c was efficient, and the rooms very clean and quiet. The beds were flawless The breakfast was also very good. The only criticism was that the hotel is dated, but they are starting a remodel as we visited. The pool was beautiful but surprisingly cold with air temperatures in the upper 80,s (low 30's C). We could not comment on value, as this was a hotel on a tour."
 October 2014,5,Marvelous palatial estate that looks like 1960s desert Southwest US,"Very quiet. many rooms. I had an outdoor private patio. they all have sitting rooms and comp fruit when you arrive. Everything works. Many features are a bit dated but it's charming and old movie stars will watch over you while you sleep. Breakfast excellent. excellent modern bed. AC is old style but worked well. Sparkling clean. Absolutely nothing to complain about here, at least for me"
 September 2014,4,Nice rooms,"The hotels claim to fame is that it houses a lot of the movie props from some famous movies filmed in Morocco like the Ten Commandants, The Mummy, The Gladiator. The rooms had a sitting room, and was very nicely appointed. The bed was very comfortable. The pool bar was very nice and the pool was great. The movie props to me seemed a little like a cheesy Las Vegas. The buffet was quite large but very crowded for breakfast. They had a nice variety."
 July 2014,5,Spectacular Pool Area,We had a suite with a separate sitting room and the bedroom had a very comfortable king sized bed. We spent most of our afternoon hours in and around the extensive pool area. Food was fine and we enjoyed our stay here very much.
 September 2014,3,Great pool scene....,This hotel has a very distinctive pool with lots of nooks to sit and enjoy the scene. This hotel has great WiFi connections. Very contemporary but no flat panel. The rooms do have patios. Note if you get a second floor room you will be carrying your bags up a winding stair case. Also there are light switched to illuminate the stairway. I learned this after using the cell phone to get to the top of the steps.
 March 2014,5,Lavish interiors....,"Quarzazate is the centre of the Moroccan film industry ! The lobby has pictures of Hollywood stars who have presumably stayed here. Makes for a good photo op. Lavish, great rooms, amazing pool and gardens, big spread at the breakfast buffet..... Didn't have enough of it. Gotta go back !"
 August 2014,4,Best Place in Ouarzazate,"I had the pleasure of having to search out hotels in Ouarzazate at last minute due to an issue with reservation in another place (it rain and the camping we reserved was all wet and humid), by far, after walking in and out of a few others, this is the best hotel in the area. If you have the budget, do not doubt it, stay here. We had two rooms for me and my family, they were outstanding quality, better than many so called 5* European Hotels. Very well maintained, exceptionally clean and comfortable. The Pool area is very big, the water was perfect and they have very good service for drinks and snacks, part of my family was feeling a bit off, so we stayed most of the day in the hotel and we had a great time. Breakfast was excellent with a very good choosing of cold and hot, nice…"
 August 2014,5,Beautiful Modern Hotel With A Gorgeous Pool,"The night before we arrived at The Berbere Palace we stayed in a tent in the dessert. While one of the most memorable nights of our stay, I was definitely in need of a real bed. We arrived at the Berbere Palace and we were greeted with warm smiles (Moroccans are great!) and a very nice hotel. The rooms are very big and the bed was amazing! Plus, the air conditioning was very strong and very cold! I loved that. The grounds reminded me of Scottsdale Arizona or Palm Springs. It was desert chic and very resort like. The pool was spectacular and the whole atmosphere was very relaxing. I wish we could have spent more time here. Berber people are wonderful!"
 July 2014,3,Interesting Hotel...,"The Berbere is a nice hotel but the decor is perhaps a bit dated. The rooms are a bit small. The Pool area is just wonderful and so peaceful, the water is always clean, with comfortable lounge chairs and beds. The food was good and the service pleasant."
 July 2014,4,Fair 3 raising to 4 stars hotel,"Nice place, fair food and services. Pool is very pleasant, room very nice despite of the few stairs to get to it in the upper floor. Tennis court was not in conditions of use. Friendly staff. Fair prices. You receive what you pay, but needs to improve to become a 5 star hotel."
 June 2014,4,Best hotel in Quarzazate,"The Berbere is the only place to stay in Quarzazate. Nice people who have all worked there for 20 years, it seems. The food is okay. Don't drink the tap water, of course. The rooms are small, although there are some bigger ones too. The pool is big and well kept, with comfortable lounge chairs and towel service. The bar is pretty well stocked, and they'll even make you a martini. The local beer is okay, but they have Heineken also. There is a very good French restaurant across the street from the hotel. Leave your AC on all the time, or some little creatures may decide to visit your room. The chill keeps they away."
 July 2013,5,large suite....good one,we stayed two nights ...service..cleanness..rooms are very good....hotel location is very good...food is delicious...staff is very co operative...very good hotel for long stay...would like to go again...
 May 2014,4,"Spacious suite, Eclectic Design in Common Areas","We had a clean, modern suite, which worked really out great for us, and seemed to be in much better shape than other rooms reviewed here. I found it very relaxing and the air conditioning worked well. I enjoyed the kitschy movie props used as decor in the main areas. (Given the nearby film studios, it was entertaining to see the film crews gathering for working meals.) We also enjoyed an afternoon by the beautiful pool. However, the one thing that wasn't to our liking, was the buffet meal plan. The quality was fine, but it's not our preference to line up and graze. It's a very large property, and overall, it worked for our two nights in this area as another smaller property was booked."
 June 2014,1,sucks and blows at the same damn time,"The staff are mostly very friendly but the service is terrible and the rooms and facilities are all in rather poor condition. Our AC broke four times and every time it was a hassle to get someone to come ""fix"" it. Eventually we moved to a different room. It's a shame because the pool area and even the restaurants have the potential to be really nice. The space itself is great. Unfortunately the food and the service are both abysmal. They call themselves a 5 star hotel but that's absurd. If they were rated by any legitimate hotel ratings organization they'd be lucky to get 3 stars."
 June 2014,4,The rooms are very spacious,"This hotel has an overall impressive look to it and they have taken advantage of the film industry based nearby, so lots of Egyptian statues and the like, good for photographs. The quality and finish of the workmanship in this hotel is not great, doors that don't close, unfinished tiling etc but as a colleague said to me, 'this is Africa!' We had an upstairs suite, the stairs are narrow and the coming down the clear head height is only about five foot where the upper level crosses the staircase so be careful. Be careful getting in and out if the bath for a shower, the nearest hospital is not just down the road! The pool is large, looks good but did not have time to use it so cannot comment further. The hotel was clean and tidy and I can recommend a stay here."
 March 2014,5,Pleasantly different!,"I would normally stay in a Fairmont or a Four season, I never needed to put a review because they always been up to my expectations , as a chain I know how it works, But in Ouarzazate there was none of the two and a friend in a movie industry from Hollywood recommended ""Beberbe Palace"" to me, The welcoming was great, especially with LEBACH, they served my wife and kids some amazing Mint tea while they swift me through the check-in, the family room was so spacious and beautifully decorated, the view we had was not that impressive at night when we got there, but in the morning, it was just breathtaking, you could actually see the Sahara dunes, just like you would see them in movies, it was just magical, the breakfast was OK! they served a buffet with Moroccan pancakes, French…"
 May 2014,4,Overrated,The hotel may be home to various movie production crews but needs some updating. I had an ant infestation in my room. TV was small. Gardens are nice. Breakfast was poor with cold eggs and hard breads. If this is best hotel in town look for a riad.
 March 2014,3,Fun Movie Props in Disappointing Hotel,"This is a large spread out property; in fact, we got lost trying to find our room. We had a first floor suite but it was dark (bedroom windows looked out on a small walled patio) with really uncomfortable furniture in the sitting room. The bathroom was crowded with basic amenities. The movie props and celebrity pictures in the lobby are fun. The service at dinner was atrocious; breakfast was fine but nothing outstanding. The pool area looked well appointed but since we were only there for one night, we had no chance to use the facilities."
 May 2014,3,Hotel needs some updates,The hotel is rates as one of the best in town howevere is showing its age. Needs a bt of updating in regards to the rooms. Lobby and public areas are very nice. I found ants crawling in my room. Hotel grounds are nice and little noise from city outside.
 May 2014,4,Piece of movie history,The reception area tells it all. The area is filled with movie setting statues from the famous history movies made in the area. But the rest is just as god. Rooms were spacious and well appointed. They offered us a smoking room which we had to change. The dining room is a spacious indoor-outdoor affair. Very reminiscent of the old days. Food was traditional morocco with some western touches. Service in the dining room and hotel was courteous and efficient.
 May 2014,4,Beautiful rooms but stairs are difficult,"We had a beautiful 2nd floor suite but the suite had only one access by a narrow twisting staircase. Nice big bed, separate AC/heat in each room, and a nice bath. The bathtub would not drain so we told the desk when we checked out. There seemed to be a faint smell of urine near the toilet."
 May 2014,4,Wish we stay longer!,The Le Berbere Palace was a very interesting bungalow-tyle hotel. The sparsely spread out accommodation gave it a resort atmosphere. The hotel also equipped with a large swimming pool with interesting day-bed and over-sized sofas around the pool. We were scheduled to stay overnight hence did not have the opportunity to enjoy the full facilities of the place. The room was sizable with large bathroom and sitting area. It was more like a studio apartment rather a standard room in city hotel. The lobby was furnished with various props either copied or the authentic one taken from the studio where several famous movies were made in Ouarzazate. The props were excellent for our memory photos. Great fun!
 November 2013,2,only a palace in the name,"Very disappointed and overpriced The food was just about acceptable i had a couscous at their speciality restaurant ...it was awfull , first time I was served a couscous without any sauce nor spice ..again had the name only. they seemed to accomodated very large groups of tourist coming from the US and Asia staying for a night prior to leaving for a desert trip or on the way back before a flight. Rooms ( we stayed in a suit ) were acceptable but lot of the aminities were broken , fridge , A/C . Bedding was ok. very nice staff though, helpfull. The swimming pool is fantastic"
 June 2013,4,Le Berbère Palace & Sahara Desert,"Le Berbère Palace is a fine place to stay if you're planning to visit the Sahara Desert. The hotel was comfortable and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. As part of a business conference, we visited the Sahara Desert for a couple of days and an overnight stay in desert tents set up by local Bedouins. The stay in the desert was arranged by French company, so in addition to riding camels through the dunes and eating fine Bedouin cuisine, the French brought along bottles of fine French wine to complement the dinner. Our Bedouin hosts did not drink any of the wine ... but they had no objections to us enjoying the wine with the fine food they prepared."
 March 2014,5,Fun and Funky,"This place is a wonderful cross between an excellent hotel and a movie set. All the rooms are set up in a sprawling mishmash suites on a large property where their room numbers are not necessarily sequential. The actual rooms are cozy, warm and wonderful. The dining area is equally large and spreads inside and out towards a very large pool. The whimsical piece is that one can see bits and pieces of past movie sets on the property.....an Assyrian bull here, a broken chariot there. It is very easy to overhear a bunch of people discussing the film production schedule for the next day. Oh, the food is excellent there too."
 March 2014,2,Flatters to decieve. Shoddy service. A transit hotel at best.,"We were here for two nights as part of our tour. This is a large hotel, so lots of changeovers and the lack of attention to detail in our room reflected that. Our safe was still locked so a couple of giggling ladies were sent to sort it out,eventually. We had no bathrobes and asked for feather pillows which took three requests. Tea took an age to arrive and the milk a further 20 minutes. The suite was OK but lighting was poor in the lounge area. Dining was buffet style and on the first night, the hotel had to cope with an influx of delayed passengers from the local airport, so very busy and extremely noisy. Breakfast was hopeless with tables not cleared and relaid. The dining room lacked a good Maitre'd. Food was average. Lots of movie memorabilia around the place, there are…"
 December 2013,5,A Lovely Property,We all enjoyed this hotel and the rooms were very comfortable. We had 3 meals here and breakfast daily and the food was delicious. The gardens and grounds are beautiful. It is a bit spread out...but after finding our rooms we found 'short-cuts' back to the main building. I found the staff to be very attentive and would recommend this property.
 March 2014,3,Time for a Remake,"The hotel is large and imposing. The grounds were nicely kept and the room was very clean. We stayed in a Vizir Suite which had two bedrooms and two baths. The real hang up I had was the fact that I fell victim to a bad lunch. While in town, we only ate at the hotel. Dinner the first night was rather uninspired Italian, all of which was close but not quite right. We slept in, and went straight to lunch at noon, where I ate the afore mentioned veal, and the rest of the family had chicken. I was stricken at 6 pm. The staff was very helpful after my husband discovered that the phones in our room did not work. Neither did our mobiles. They placed calls, got my husband a taxi to the night pharmacy, sent the cleaners in to clean both bathrooms. (It was bad. Really bad.) …"
 February 2014,2,Over-rated and pretentious,"Advertised as a 5-star hotel, it has enormous rooms (we stayed in a 'junior suite') but totally sterile and lacking in any charm or hospitality. The evening meal was entirely a buffet, but with almost no attendant staff. No guidance was given as to what was on offer; used plates were not cleared between courses; a request for a pepper pot was not actioned until the meal was finished. At breakfast coffee was available only from machines, so one had to go back to the machine each time for a re-fill. Checking out, there was only one staff member to deal with a small queue and it took 20 minutes. The fact that it is decorated with a lot of fake items from old movie sets says quite a lot about the hotel!"
 January 2014,3,Beautiful gardens shame about the rooms,"The Le Berbere Palace Quarzazate according to our tour guide is the only 5 star hotel in this area. Apparently, movie stars and rich French tourists are the main patrons of this hotel. He forgot to add tour groups to that list. The hotel has beautiful grounds and gardens, I think that is where the beauty ends. We were given a room that was on the second floor. To get there we had a flight of narrow winding steps which was pitch black for a person who could see but dangerous for those who are visually impaired. They had not bothered to turn on the main switch to have power and lights turned on in the room below us and there was no lights in the room upstairs that we were supposed to stay in. The people below us who were on the same Insight Vacations tour as us, fumbled…"
 December 2013,3,"Beautiful grounds, spacious but dated room","This was billed as a 5 star hotel, which I don't agree with. It was big and had lovely grounds and nice decor in the lobby and common areas. Our room was spacious but very dated and not modern. The ""mini bar"" was a rickety dorm fridge with two cokes, two waters and two beers (there were three of us in the suite), one phone didn't work, and one heating unit didn't work. Breakfast was huge and you could basically get anything."
 November 2013,5,Truly a Palace!,"Unfortunately, we arrived in the dark to this beautiful oasis at the edge of the desert. The hotel itself is beautiful and our suite was spacious with a living room area and fireplace. The furnishings were elegant in the suite and in the common areas of the hotel. Our only complaint was with the buffet dinner. Although the salad bar was large with many delicious looking options, the hot buffet table food looked dried out and over cooked. My husband ended up with an intestinal problem during the night with fever from one of the dishes. Our friend also tasted the dish and didn't eat it as she felt something wasn't right. My only suggestion is to order ala carte dinner not from the buffet. Breakfast on the other hand was delicious with made to order omelets and wonderful…"
 December 2013,5,Best hotel in Ouarzazate,"Entry It’s located in the center of the city and is easy to find. It has an enormous presence on the road so you can’t miss it. From the outside it looks like a large Kasbah/palace. Friendly bellmen greet you at the curbside and whisk your bags into the lobby with a smile. Reception was somewhat tedious filling out forms and answering lots of questions. Not nearly as friendly. The bellmen then carry your bags down the stairs and then up the stairs to your room. They do so as if they are enjoying their job which is a refreshing way for a hotel greeting. Room The rooms are large, new and comfortable. It appears that they are all “duplexes” – two room buildings with one on the ground floor and one above. There was no view from the second floor. Amenities were appropriate for…"
 December 2013,5,True Oasis,"Outstanding spacious rooms, beautiful pool area, excellent food (both occidental and local) and lovely Staff. If you are traveling towards the desert this hotel is not just a stop by; it is part of the trip itself. Reserve time to enjoy it."
 November 2013,5,Wonderfull Hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights, at the start and the end of our travel in Morocco. We didn't have enough time to enjoy the heated swimming pool unfortunately but the hotel, staff and food made up for it wonderfully. The manager is very friendly! The rooms are very spacious and the food in plenty and great! The hotel is located only 5 minutes from the airport."
 November 2013,5,Service ALWAYS with a smile,I have never been to Morocco and really had no idea what to expect. I traveled to Ouarzazate for work and needed to be there for over 5 weeks. The arrangements were made for me which can always be a little scary. Staying at the Le Berbere Palace couldn't have been a more pleasant surprise. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. The entire place is kept immaculate. The rooms were very comfortable. The breakfast in the restaurant was very good and the buffet I had for Dinner was ridiculous - - so GOOD and SOOOOO much food. I limped back to my room uncomfortable I ate so much. Couldn't stop. But really the best part of this place... the people. I travel a lot for work and have been to a multitude of cities and stayed in a ton of hotels... I swear this has to be the…
 November 2013,4,"Pretty hotel, average food","Overall -- a very nice hotel. Room was very comfortable and clean. We had a separate seating area. The walk to our room had lovely flowering trees and shrubs. Buffet dinners were marred by too many Continental dishes (the Moroccan food was good, but the rest -- not so much). The poolside dining was marred by the overwhelming smell of ""compost"" -- otherwise known as manure in the plantings. But -- there were lovely and very friendly cats who were anxious to be friendly and see how much of the continental dishes they could cage from the tourists -- which was very very nice for those who missed their pets!"
 July 2013,4,Le Berbere Palace - a refreshing stop in Ouarzazate,"We stayed at Le Berbere Palace for one night during a nine day tour of Morocco. We had a suite, with living area. We heard that Brad Pitt has a suite in the hotel when he films in the area. We were greeted with a bowl of fruit and walnuts. A nice surprise, but fruit flies took it over within a few hours. The pool is spectacular. Best one of our trip. It is not heated but refreshing in the warm summer evening. Had dinner and breakfast poolside. Great both times. The hotel is like a movie museum. Give yourself 30 minutes just to look at all the movie props and posters in the common areas and on restaurant walls. This is very much a film hotel. There were 6 industry guys taking shop over drinks at the next table to us at dinner. Very distinctive room key. Tried to purchase…"
 July 2013,4,Nice hotel,We stayed one night on a tour and this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in whilst touring morocco.our room was large with separate lounge room with another tv. Separate toilet.the room was very clean.reception was helpful the porters quick. The pool is very big but the water a little cool not that bad but.the pool area is large and quite nice with a bar. We had buffet dinner and it was by far the best we have had in morocco
 May 2013,5,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed here for one night on a business trip. I think I had a Superior room, it had a nice living area with sofas and bedroom separated with a curtain. Huge bed, very firm (which i love), and a giant TV. I was also greeted with a bowl of fruit, walnuts wrapped in Dates and salted almonds - Delicious and a nice touch. I was also lucky enough to have a look at the Kings Suite which is incredible if you have the budget, it even has its own dining room and 3 separate bedrooms. The only problem we had was with room service breakfast when they have to send a waiter to take your order in your room, rather than just taking the order on the phone, which obviously slowed the process down a little. I highly recommend this Hotel."
 June 2013,4,3 weeks here.,"I recently returned from working in Ouarzazate and Le Berbere Palace was my home for the 3 weeks. It's a very comfy and very friendly hotel. The staff are all very friendly, the pool is great (but REALLY cold) the food is fine, the drinks are also good. I felt that the rooms were a little dated, and showed some signs of wear and tear, but the bed was really comfortable and the cleaners kept it spick and span! I'm sure I will be back there, but I do definitely reccommend it!"
 April 2013,3,Very impressive pool and gardens...,"...however the accommodation is very spread out and one tires of the long walk to and from the room. Also a lot of the rooms, including ours, are on ground level right beside a walkway necessitating closing the blinds for privacy and losing most of the natural light as the rear only looked out on to a nearby brick wall."
 May 2013,5,Liked a lot,"As someone said some comments below, it might influence if you are coming from the desert and the tents or from a big city. After a difficult night in the bivouac and lack of sleep the night before, the hotel was a most welcome stop. But I´m sure I would like it even if traveling in the opposite direction. The Berbere Palace is an elegant hotel, of great comfort, excellent bed, with an interesting and beautiful horizontal distribution over a large area behind its non distinct façade. Big, comfortable rooms, with a separate seating area, at least the one assigned to us was such. The hotel has an inviting and much used swimming pool area and good restaurants, which we used for dinner and breakfast. We found excelent service and attention from the staff, in our case particularly…"
 October 2012,4,Very large hotel in the city,"This is a very large hotel, yet well organized and runs efficiently. It was a quick stop, in at the end of the day and out the next morning first thing. We were delighted to have a suite and there was more than enough room for our quick stay. The shower and tub were in separate rooms which made for easy clean up time. The buffet in the large dining room was extensive and lots of good choices to be made and delicious. The only problem we had were the extensive number of fruit flies in the tub."
 May 2013,4,nice hotel but expensive,"The hotel is nice, very clean and well placed for the town, the staff make this hotel a pleasant stay as they cannot do enough to help you. drinks are expensive and there is inconsistency with room rates. If film crews are staying here, its noisy and the pool area is crowded"
 May 2013,5,A very nice hotel in Ouarazate,"We stopped here for one night on our way to Marrakesh coming from Erfoud. It's a very nice hotel and makes a feature of all the films that have been shot in the area. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel as someone had recommended a local restaurant. Breakfast was served buffet style which was perfectly fine. The whole experience was very comfortable but the actual hotel lacks the charm of many of the other riads and hotels we stayed in. It could have been a hotel in California or Arizona. HAving said that, it is very conveniently located and all in all a very nice stay."
 May 2013,4,responses to earlier comments,"In general, I think it matters greatly whether you are traveling to or from the desert. Obviously, if you have been roughing it, the hotel will seem more glamorous and comfortable. If you are coming from urban, five-star accommodations it will seem less so. Specifically here are three responses to earlier reviews and room tips -- working backwards to the beginning of 2013: May -- There is good shopping down the street as well; don't limit yourself to the stores you can see from the hotel entrance. March -- The rooms are not the same; there are lovely suites available as well. January -- I thought the ""cheesy"" movie props were actually rather charming -- celebrating Quarzazate's film industry (Atlas Studios is one of the largest in the world.)."
 April 2013,5,Too bad we stayed only one night,"This is a lovely hotel, with a very large restaurant and bar area. The room was very private in the way it was situated - the hotel is laid out with rooms as separate ""cabanas"" - and in our case, only two rooms were in our ""cabana"". We enjoyed the breakfast buffet - the selection was wonderful. Don't miss the shopping across the street from the entrance!"
 April 2013,5,An excellent hotel,"Would recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit the Sahara desert as the hotel is 4 hours hair raising drive from the airport over the Atlas mountains! We went to see our son come in having run the Marathon des Sables and the trip was expertly arranged by Complete Morocco. info@completemorocco.com who only arrange bespoke trips to unusal places in Morocco. The hotel itself was beautiful and the service super - they even provided a full lavish breakfast for us all at 2.45 a.m. before our 6 hour drive to the finishing post ! Frankly, we were only expecting toast and jam. The rooms very comfortable and clean and the swimming pool and surrounding areas first class. Would highly recommend."
 March 2013,4,A Lovely Escape,"This is like an oasis of luxury in the desert city! The facade resembles a Casba wall, and seems foreboding. But you step inside, and it's all calmness, tranquility, and amazing movie memorabilia from many movies shot in the area by the local studios. The rooms are laid out in garden style, and, again, from the outside appear quite ordinary. But inside, the decor is a perfect harmony of colors, textures and accessories: plush rugs, comfortable couches with large throw pillows, tapestries. The bedroom is a nice mix of modern furniture with local art & craft enhancements, large comfy bed, and spacious closets. The bathroom is equipped with all the latest amenities and top-line toiletries. The restaurant is well-staffed, the service is efficient & courteous, though our dinner…"
 April 2013,4,Good rooms and lovely facilities,"This hotel is a lovely oasis when coming out of the desert. The rooms are large, with a sitting room and 2 TV's. Beautiful swimming pool area and bar. Dinner and breakfast were both buffets with lots of choices and good food. A down side is that the WIFI does not work in the rooms, only in the public areas."
 March 2013,2,Unhelpful and Unfriendly Front Desk,"The staff member who checked us in was dismissive and unhelpful when our credit card got misplaced at the check in desk with him, saying that we should look for it ourselves and ""next time, pay attention!"" (direct quote). I politely confronted him about his behavior an hour later after we'd settled in, and continued to be dismissive. I informed a manager on check-out and he was similarly unapologetic and unsympathetic - this confirmed for us that this hotel is not in the business of catering to guests but simply to complete the rental agreement. The pool area is actually quite nice and a pleasant place to be. The room was clean, but outdated (door fixtures painted over, AC unit not functioning, no furniture on terrace). The movie props out and around the commons areas are…"
 March 2013,4,Excellent facilities and service,A rather unique hotel with links to the movie business - the lobby is full of props from films made in the area eg Cleopatra's throne. The rooms are of a good size and have a nice sitting area and all the facilities you need including free Wi-Fi. The pool area is large with plenty of comfortable beds including doubles! Contrary to the expertiences of other reviewers we found the food good - we chose the buffet. In all cases service was excellent. In all an ideal stop if you are crossing the Atlas mountains and are en route to the Sahara.
 February 2013,3,Only for a travel break,"It is a hotel made entirely for a travel stop over and it serves only that purpose. It is very standard and nothing special. Food is terrible and you can easily avoid eating at the hotel as the main square is a short walk away where there are many better options to eat and try out. We unfortunately had dinner and breakfast included in our package and ate both meals which were very bad!!! We even returned most of dinner uneaten and the waiter asked us, ""Hope it isn't that you don't like the food and only that you are full""!! Breakfast was the standard fare as made for feeding bus loads of people. Few options when you are travelling and need a one night stop over."
 March 2013,4,Flash hotel,Enjoyed a good meal here on a day trip between Marrakesh and Ouarzazate which must be one of the most splendid car journeys in Africa. From minus 1 to 9 degrees in an hour or so and vice versa. The High Atlas mountain roads are superb. This hotel is weird in a nice sort of way. The restaurant empty as was the hotel but don't be put off. Huge swimming pool and the city is an interesting one especially if you want to visit the film studios that abound. Bit of a disney building reminds me of those old hotels in North AFrica from the past maybe fifty years ago. The Rif in Tangier and old Mamounia in Marrakesh as it was before the renovations. Service here was exceptional and I had my most delicious tagine in my trip.
 March 2013,3,Decent,"Clean-enough hotel with good-enough service. Food is terrible, but overall the experience is worthwhile if like us you're seeking someplace safe and convenient for a few nights. Good wifi reception. Very cute plantings & pool area"
 November 2012,5,Just What The Doctor Ordered,"We were very impressed with Le Berbere Palace. After spending 6 days rattling around the desert on an amazing journey, this was the cherry on top! We had booked a room online and were expecting something nice and we were not disappointed. At check in we were upgraded immediately to a 130 square meter suite at no extra charge! This room was tremendous! Beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean. 60 inch plasma TV and a sofa that could seat 16 people.The bed was enormous. I didn't know that they made a size bigger than ""king"". Much more than we needed or expected, but being plopped down into the lap of luxury after sleeping in the sand was absolutely fantastic. The grounds were also lovely and maintained at a high standard. By far one of the most beautiful swimming pools I have…"
 January 2013,4,no problems really,This hotel was basically okay. my room was warm (it got really cold at night) and clean. They had put a fruit plate in the room. the location was good for walking to things. The service was not super attentive and the wifi was a joke- it was very weak even in the lobby. Breakfast had a good selection.
 February 2012,4,"On the edge of the Sahara,not too bad then!!","Considering its location, quite remote, I think this hotel was quite good. I was fed well, I slept well, the staff were polite and helpful. I didn't see much wrong with the building itself, but then again I wasn't inspecting it that closely. This hotel is used a lot by TV and Film crews who are on location in the desert so you expect to see some familiar faces if you visit. I plan to take my wife on a tour of Morocco and I plan to take her here!"
 February 2012,3,Decent Hotel in the Desert,"We stayed here one night after our trip in the desert and on our way to Marrakech. The hotel is huge and seems ""grand,"" but up close it seems a bit worn and in need of an update. Our room was fine for 1 night, a bit small though. Because of the town's history, there are a lot of old movie ""momentos"" all very cheesy quite honestly. There is no wifi, only a computer room, and it was very tricky figuring out how to log on. Comapred to everywhere else we stayed, food was pretty average / slightly below average. All buffet style. I suggest the pasta station for dinner, everything else was not so good. Again, for a 1 night stay when making your way out of the desert it's fine, but definitely not a destination."
 December 2012,5,Very good staff,"The staffs at this hotel were very helpful and friendly. At the time of check-in, a room which we asked for was not available but offered us a free upgreade and provided us with an even better room for us without asking anything. Also, our departure flight from Ouarzazate was at 20:45 and we asked a late check out at around 18:00 and they offered us a late check-out without any extra charge. The room was very confortable and breakfast was offered from 5:30 to 10:30 which was very nice. The quality of breakfast was not an excellent level but considering the location of this hotel (not a capital or metropolitan city), it was quite OK. The location of this hotel is a bit far from downtown area but still walikng distance. Only the point we did not like was wifi availablitity in the…"
 December 2012,4,Oasis in the dessert,"This was an unexpected find in this remote town, especially after our night spent in a tent among dunes. Has a nice and comfortable lobby with plenty of comfortable seating and WiFi. The rooms are in a semi bungalo style, nicely and generously decorated with a plate of fruits waiting for us. No WiFi in the room though they had smartly put in an AP right in the room. TV was a little small and all has few English channels and no movies. Hotel has nice restaurants and a very nice and friendly bar. A nice big pool and many special artifacts from some of the famous movies shot in the studios nearby. Service was efficient and timely and the staff was kind and helpful. Definitely a good alue."
 November 2012,4,Not luxuriuous but nice,"Location- Not sure. Another come late leave early day. I like it so much better when we travel on our own. Escorted tours are lame, but with events in the Middle East we were a little concerned of going on our own. Reception – friendly and helpful for Moroccan standards. The king wants to double tourism in a couple of years. I suggest he improves the tourist education and standards of the first people you have contact with, hotel reception, taxis, tour guides, they are just so rude in general. Decor- It was very nice with props from movies made in town, but dated. Not of a 5 star quality. Breakfast- Just about everything you might want. Coffee was not too great. Room- we had a suit and it was nice but not luxurious Light- a little better than normal in Morocco Bed-…"
 October 2012,5,"Beautiful hotel, an oasis in the desert!","We stayed here one night as part of a National Geographic tour of Morocco. Our group loved it and wanted to stay longer, but we had to move on! We did not arrive until the cocktail hour, so enjoyed a drink by the pool. Before dinner. It was a beautiful and lovely evening. Our rooms each had a sitting room, very attractive and welcoming, but alas, no time to sit! We enjoyed seeing the items from movie sets. It was fun! If ever we are this way again, we would choose to stay here."
 April 2012,4,review,"my likes, - overall impression and quality - decoration - refreshing menus - comfortable chairs and sofas by the pool - services menu - one of the top hotels in ouarzazate by services and standards - good recommendations available from concierge for town historic sightseeing and restaurants"
 October 2012,4,Old Hollywood glamour but slightly frayed round the edges,"We stayed here for 3 weeks and absolutely enjoyed it! We were working in the desert most of the days and to come back to a crisp clean room and great snacks was an absolute treat! There is only one pool but still quite sizeable. The food is ok but there's a bunch of great restaurants nearby to choose from. Overall great value for money, very central, and definitely one of the better places to stay in, on Ozz."
 September 2012,3,The Barstow of Morocco,"I was in Ourzazate working on a film so this was my home for quite a while. The service was great and the people were friendly. The food here is pretty dicey and they make coffee from unfiltered water... Beware. The best restaurant in town is across the street so that makes this place worth it on that alone. The wifi only worked in the lobby or by the pool while I was there. We visited a few other hotels to visit and I definitely had the impression that this place was the best big hotel to stay in within town. With that said, it's not saying much."
 October 2012,5,What a good feeling this place conveys,"Ourzazate, the film capital of Morocco, is a remote town, the gate to the south and it's desert so don't expect big city luxury here but, that said, the Berbere Palace had nothing but good wibes for us. Good value. Charming staff, all of them, excellent no nonsense service, the best, meaning very fast, WIFI (free and everywhere), several good restaurants serving much better fare than the ones in town, very flexible meal offers and times, desert sunrise excursions oblige breakfast starts at 4,30 AM !. No effort is spared to make the clients comfortable. The staff is obviously happy to work but do not omit to tip them, they are poor and deserving. Funny ""kitch"" decor of movies having been shot around here. A charming hotel which even the sometimes too large tour groups could not…"
 September 2012,3,Great pool,"The highlight of this hotel is the pool, which given the hot weather was the place to be. The room was spacious, but a/c didn't work well so they tried to repair it and then switched us to a different room after a hot, sleepless night. Food was okay, quantity over quality and drinks were very expensive."
 August 2012,4,Very nice hotel,The hotel is beautiful but the rooms aren't very clean. The service is great and the staff is very polite. The hotel manager watches everyone closely so everything works perfect. I didn't like the food although it was beautifully presented. The location is good.
 July 2012,5,Ouarzazate's Finest,"This is THE place to stay in Ouarzazate for comfort and luxury targeted for Westerners. Beautiful lobby and side areas with interesting movie props and set pieces. Fantastic pool surrounded by well stocked bar, adjacent sitting areas and a large, shaded harem tent, all nicely lit in the evening and a perfect setting for cocktails. Dinner in the main dining room was a buffet, more Western than Moroccan, but good with enough variety to choose. That was okay, considering my friend and I visited in July which is low season. Rooms are in buildings behind the main building, and at the other end are pleasant sitting areas and even a modest gym. The hotel is just a ten minute walk to the plaza at the center of town for some local Moroccan ambience. The staff is attentive and…"
 May 2012,5,Excellent hotel and service,"From arrival through to departure the service was excellent. We had a problem with our hire car and the receptionist on our arrival arranged for it to be fixed straight away and organised everything with the hire company. Our room was a suite in the gardens.. Wonderful, spacious and spotless. Pool was great, and pool side service great too. We arrived late one night as the barmen were closing but they reopened to make us coffee without any hesitation. Some quirky relics around the hotel and great for photos. Not every day you can sit on an Egyptian throne before breakfast.."
 July 2012,4,You won't find better in Ouarzazate...but that doesn't mean much,"Obviously a 5 star hotel maybe 10 yes ago. Now just the pool is at that caliber. Rooms are very spacious, clean and makes u feel like u went back in time 15 years. Front desk staff was very nice and breakfast buffet was good. a bit on the pricey side but then staid I have found that with exceptions of riads, most large hotels that a guide considers 5 star is actually 4 star and is over priced. Booked by walking in same day...this hotel is very large so a room was not a problem."
 July 2012,4,Surprisingly good for the location especially,"Stayed a very pleasant couple of nights. Room was very large, spotless and well appointed. Nice big French style ( bidet and all) bathroom. AC was on when arriving thank goodness as it was 110 outside. Restaurant dinner buffet leaned too much on pleasing bland loving Europeans and we missed having more local dishes as Moroccan cuisine can be so amazingly good. Service was very good too the point of trying too hard in a charming way. Altogether very agreeable."
 June 2012,5,Great place. Pizza on the buffet!,"We had a nice room with two floors. Two floors with two full bathrooms, great air conditioning. I did a lot of hand washing of our clothes here, and appreciated having all the space and the good air movement to let the clothing air dry. One negative note, there were bugs all over the floor. Little ants. I know bugs are hard to control, but we really couldn't leave anything out on the floor due to the bugs. Even with the bugs, the management sprayed and did their best and it didn't ruin on our stay. They had a nice buffet that included pizza and pasta. After a week of Moroccan food, the kids were thrilled to see some American food on the buffet. The pool is beautiful and they had great bar service at it. I went to their spa and enjoyed it. Several in our group had…"
 June 2012,4,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for a week with my husband who was working in Morocco and he stayed in the hotel for 3 months. It is a beautiful hotel, particularly the pool area which miraculously manages to be both a suntrap and maintain a lovely breeze most of the time. The rooms are spread over the site on one or two floors. The interconnecting pathways are well maintained and shady with the occasional area of fountains and comfortable seating in shady gazebos. The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The maids did an excellent job with fresh flowers most days and bowls of fruit. A small fridge allows you to keep water cold, but you have to ask if you want a minibar. The TV is fairly useless, but we managed to get a broadband connection from our room (I don't think that is the…"
 June 2012,5,"Bebere palace, Ouarzarte",Can't fault this hotel. The food and service was excellent. The swimming pool was absolutely fabulous too. Should have been a six star!
 March 2012,5,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is very impressive. The artwork alone is extraordinary. Everywhere you are met with opulent design and decorations. We stayed in a very nice 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were spacious, and there was a wonderful row of stores right across the street. One store in particular is owned and operated by an old man and his son. They proudly collect and display theirbreathtaking jewelry and other cultural items. This small shop is an unforgettable shopping experience for those who are looking for one of a kind Moroccan jewelry, leather etc. Good prices. No one trying at all to pressure you into buying!"
 July 2011,3,good,very good hotel still expansive but the staff was amzing and helfull !!! managing it was poor i!!
 June 2012,4,Palace it is..,"After staying at the Mercure for more than 5 times in the last month, it was time to move to some place where the rooms are not claustrophobic and there is decent food to eat. The Berbere Palace has a great pool and Italian restaurant that dishes out fresh food (luckily vegetarian also) and it turned out to be the perfect place for me to stay after all my visits to ouarzazate. I am coming back here.."
 May 2012,4,Le Berbere Palace,Good Points about the hotel We were booked for Double Room but were Upgraded to Suite The rooms are Spacious and Clean The air conditioning was Good The staff was friendly Not so Good Points Decor is not Classy Limited Vegetarian Breakfast
 May 2012,4,Comfortable and Clean,"We stayed here twice. Both at the beginning and end of our trip to the area. The first time, they could not find our reservation even though we showed them the emailed confirmation. Thankfully, they had rooms available even though the hotel was quite busy with a film crew staying there and also an off-road racing tour. The rooms are comfortable with nice duvets and pillows. The air conditioning cools the room, but only to a point. We were not uncomfortable, but we did have it set to max. The pool is quite nice, they have poolside service for both drinks and lunch. There are also many nice areas around the grounds for lounging with a good book. The service was good albeit a little slow. They try to be formal. I can see how it could come across as rude to some, but we didn't…"
 May 2012,4,A nice place to stay,"Although our first room was so putrid with smoke 3 more people after us knocked it back also. The room we ended up with was smaller but not rendered impossible by cigarette/cigar smoke. The pool area is lovely and nice to sit by. Food was amongst the nicest we had, desserts to die for. It was a pretty nice experience."
 May 2012,4,Spacious hotel though old,"We got a two-level suite with a spacious room on each level. There is a bathroom and toilet on each level too. A living room downstairs completes the suite. Though it is a old property, the furniture seems well maintained. However, one third of the lights in our suite did not work. Room amenities are lacking. The dinner and breakfast buffet were forgettable. Surprisingly hotel of this grade does not have wifi in rooms. All in all, it was still a comfortable place for a stopover night at Ouarzazate. A haven after your desert adventure."
 April 2012,2,Not as advertised,"The air conditioning is very very noisy and there is no relief even if you switch it off. The room door does not prevent any noise at all, you think that all the people walk and talk in your room. The mini bar was empty (not even mineral water). The shower produced randomly cold and hot water. if you have a hearing aid which you can switch off, you will like the hotel, in particular, if you have your own food and drinks or do not bother being ripped off. Nevertheless, you should have some spare time. For all other travellers, the good thing is that you learn to appreciate other hotels."
 April 2012,4,Ouarzazate's Prop House,Stayed here for a couple of nights either side of running the Marathon Des Sables. the vast buffet breakfasts and dinners were great sustenance. The common areas were decorated with eye-catching film props from the nearby production studios. Beds were also very comfortable (especially after a week of sleeping in the desert)! Service was friendly and good. Perhaps not a 5 star by European standards but pretty fine for Morocco.
 April 2012,5,A welcome luxury,"Just having successfully finished the 2012 Marathon Des Sables I have to say that this hotel (apart from being the ONLY '5 star' in the town) lived up to expectations even though there was a very large number of guests all wanting the same things! Despite what others may say the food was good the rooms clean and the staff helpful. The town itself is a little remote (though quite large) but if this part of Morocco is your thing, this hotel is the best you can get in the area"
 April 2012,4,Excellent choice - perhaps best in town,"Stayed as part of tour - were more than satisfied. Our room included a separate bedroom apart from living room, and small sheltered outdoor sitting area (without view). Pool large and lovely. food very good, but wine prices high, as in most Moroccan hotels. Had trouble getting water hot enoough for our satisfaction, room large and clean. Hotel busy with marathon race in town at same time, but reasonably quiet in room."
 November 2011,4,"Quite touristy, but still good","There's a lot of movie junk in the hotel and the rooms are kind of small, but the grounds are nice the lobby is beautiful, and the breakfast is incredibly extensive. All in all, pretty good!"
 November 2011,2,Boring,"This hotel had nothing to offer, the service wasn't good, and the food wasn't very good either. Also, the rooms were cold."
 September 2011,5,An oasis,"I was shocked at how Western and well-equipped La Berbere Palace was. Ouarzazate is really in the middle of nowhere, and yet somehow the proprietors managed to create and maintain a sprawling, luxury hotel that wouldn't look out of place in Phoenix or Palm Springs. It has spacious, well-appointed rooms, a great pool, and good food. Semi-functional internet too! I will definitely stay there again if I'm ever in the vicinity."
 March 2012,5,"Great hotel, Great Service","Le Berbere Palace was described to me as the best hotel in Ouarzazate. While I can't actually state that's the case (as it's the only hotel I've stayed at in Ouarzazate), after my visit I don't really have any desire to look for somewhere else to stay. The staff are friendly and efficient, as one would expect from a hotel of this class. The rooms were excellent - I wound up in a two bedroom suite with a small living room and sizable bathroom. There were a number of common areas throughout the property where we could gather for conversation without needing to walk all the way to the smoky bar or the lobby. The pool area is straight out of a trendy LA hotel. The food--for us, at least was buffet style, but included Moroccan and international dishes that were very well…"
 February 2012,4,Nice hotel,I stayed there for one night with my family (2 children of 2 and 4 years). The hotel is very big. Our room was quite big with a little living room. The bath was ok and clean. The hotel has a swimming pool. We had dinner at the pizzeria of the hotel for my children. There is a very nice bar where you can have a drink. The service was very good.
 November 2011,5,Nice stay! Very up scale.,Very nice. We stayed during off season and the up graded our room.. The bed was very comfortable. The props from movies around was a nice touch. We even spotted a celebrity eating breakfast with us!
 November 2011,4,Breath of Fresh Air,"After having disappointing hotel experiences in both Casablanca and Marrakech, the Berbere Palace was a welcome change. The room was both clean and comfortable. The rooms are showing some signs of wear, but are quite nice. Roses on the nightstand; robe in the room. Lovely grounds. Friendly staff. Good food. Be sure to check out all the kitchy movie memorabilia around the hotel. The only negative was the sounds from outside starting at 6 am (doors opening/closing, bag carts rolling, etc.)."
 November 2011,1,this place is awful!,"My wife and I stayed here for a night before going on a desert tour - the reception staff were really unfreindly and unhelpful (didn't give us any introduction to the facilities, my wife waited 30 minutes in the reception area for a cup of tea), our room was ok but definitely not the standard we expected from a supposedly 5 star hotel, the rooms were very dated and most of the hotel is the same. The food was quite poor, staff unfriendly (apart from the cleaners who actually acknowledged us), it was a really weird atmosphere, even the guests didn't make any eye contact let alone say hello! It reminded me of the hotel in the Shining, but with less charm. I would recommend you avoid this place, there's a hotel 2 minutes down the road which is of a similar standard (i.e. not…"
 December 2010,3,Thank goodness for the fantastic pool.,"I stayed at the Berbere for 3 months for work. Now any place will get old after that long however the here are some of the pros/cons Pros: Absolutely AMAZING pool and pool area both during the day and at night. The Hammam was very enjoyable and the breakfast buffet was great. Service in the restaurant and around the pool was awesome. Rooms were big. Bathrooms were big and both were clean. Cleaning staff were awesome as well. front desk staff leave a little to be desired with their arrogance and condescending attitude. The rooms are very dated, mattresses not the best."
 October 2011,4,"Lovely hotel, but it is a bit dated","This hotel has beautiful grounds, and although we were generally pleased with our suite, it felt a bit dated, and in need of a renovation. The food (we had the dinner buffet) was very mediocre."
 March 2011,4,A must in Ouarzazate,"I've been to the Bèrbère Palace about 12 times and it is always a pleasure to return. The staff is capable and friendly. They organised on short term notice a private méchouie in a berber tent in the desert for us. The pool is great, food in the Moroccan restaurant excellent and the bars are nice places to hang around. However some of the older rooms would need a little refresh."
 April 2011,2,ok-ish hotel but the reception gave the worst service i have ever experienced,"The hotel is at best a 3-star rating, it's only 5 compared to others i guess. I spent 1 night on my own which i had booked independently through an operator, and the second and third nights, i was joining a very large group, of which my partner was part of. There had been a slight mix up, which resulted in me having to enquire about booking the additional 2 nights directly with the hotel - which they quoted me more than 4 times the price i had paid for the 1st night. We managed to sort out this mix up, as the group found my room booking - because of this mix up, we were then asigned to the worst room I have ever seen, at the very back end of the hotel, with dirty sheets, wet towels and no working shower. I was forced to complain, and was then thrown a new key accorss the…"
 December 2010,4,An Oasis,"Very nice hotel, helpful staff and great swimming pool !!!"
 December 2010,3,"hotel is good, rooms average, and a bit old","Rooms are very dated, need renovation - it does not deserve a five star rating At 3 star, it's a good hotel. We had a cockroach dead on our bathroom floor. Other than that, hotel is average."
 December 2010,5,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel, with helpful staff, great swimming pools and other common areas. We had booked a suite and got two huge rooms, two bathrooms and a living room. Would certainly go back."
 October 2010,3,Attractiveness of common areas do not translate to rooms,"The attractive and expansive common areas make for disappointment with the rooms. The property itself consists of seemingly endless choices of bars, restaurants, pools, fountains, and gardens. However, the rooms are disappointing and much in need of an update. My room looked like Holiday Inn circa 1985, dull and with outdated burgundy velour decor. Ick. This was disappointing because Le Berbere Palace is operated by the same company that runs the lovely and consistent La Tour Hassan hotel in Rabat."
 January 2010,2,"Big, ugly and impersonal","Before starting I must say that I generally dislike big hotels. I booked a ridiculously expensive room at Le Berbere Palace just because my mother swore that it was the only accomodation in Ouarzazate (my bad, I wish I had checked the internet before). Not only Le Berbere Palace is a huge outdated hotel, but it is also tacky and charmless, reminding me of the worst face of colonialism. It resembles a turist village more than a hotel: indipendent cottages, three or four restaurants, swimming pool, bar...everything whithin the structure so you could be tempted to spend your days inside and never go out and see that gem in the desert that is Ouarzazate."
 October 2010,3,Hollywood in Morocco,"On the day that we checked into Le Berbere Palace Ouarzazate, there was an entourage of the Moroccan King staying in the hotel as well. Hence, it couldn't be that bad especially when we had a worse experience at a hotel near the Sahara. The first impression was lots of Hollywood props. The hotel uses props from Hollywood blockbusters to decorate the common area. We checked into the hotel at about 7pm and the lack of signboards to the rooms was distressing. The rooms are housed in two-storey buildings around the hotel main building. You have to walk out of the main lobby in order to get to your rooms. The poor use of signs made us walking round blocks searching for our room. We wasted more than 30 mins just to get to the room. But after we got into the room, the…"
 July 2010,3,Great staff in the middle of nowhere!,"Despite the hotel being in the middle of nowhere it was a welcome break in the trip. So welcome in fact that we cancelled our trip to the desert to spend a day in the hotel and around the pool. Wonderful breakfast, all the service we encountered was excellent especially the food and beverage staff and our room was great. I would agree with other reviews that it needs a bit of a make over but it doesn't detract from the blue skies and sunshine! Unfortunately like many places in Morocco, there is not much in the way of restaurants etc outside the hotel yet I can imagine after being there a week (we stayed 3-nights) the menu may get a bit tiresome."
 June 2010,4,In need of refurbishment,All the hotel also still in good shape needs a major uplift. I was there 10 years ago and nothing has changed. Nice & bad: swimming pool quite cold because no recycling (overflow system with new fresh water).
 June 2010,5,The best hotel in Ouarzazate,For work I visit about 10 hotels in Ouarzazate. This one was the best one I saw. The prices is a bit high but worth it.
 May 2010,3,Le Berbere Palace was is in need of an update,"My husband and I and two daughters, who are in the early 20's, spent 3 nights in Le Berbere Palace. The pool area is very nice as are the common areas of the hotel. We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the ground level. It had a living room, bedroom, toilet room and bathroom. Our daughters stayed in a two bedroom suite, on the second floor. The layout of the suites was quite nice. The suites, however, are in immediate need of updating. The bathrooms were horrible. They felt old and dirty. The prices for this hotel are at a 5 star level. The accommodations, however, are not."
 May 2010,4,Nice Surprise,"In a city that's in the middle of nowhere (is more a stopover for the Dunes), this hotel packs in a good deal. Rooms are very spacious & clean. Breakfast spread is good & there's a nice pool (around which a Hollywood film crew invariably hangs out),"
 March 2009,3,Nice Enough but expensive,"This is an impressive looking building with large lobby area in traditional Morrocan style, pool and bar area with a good amount of nice seating and a large restaurant. I enjoyed the look and feel of the place and very quickly found myself getting settled in and comfortable. I stayed here on two separate nights the first room was perfectly acceptable but average the second a superior room much better. The staff were fine, neither great or poor, they did their job to my satisfaction. The restaurant was serving a buffet which in place like this can be bad, but it was fine. Good selection and good quality. Everything in this hotel is expensive. I am guessing its because they class it as a five star (its not) and because the town is remote. The prices are not justified, but if…"
 April 2010,4,Far better than expected,"We were very hesitant about the Le Berbere Palace hotel as our A & K agent felt it was not up to standards. We must say we found the hotel really quite nice. We had a lovely, large room with a great bathroom and all the amenities one could ask for. It’s not a 5 star hotel, but it is very nice and, like so many of the previous reviews, we wished we could have stayed an additional night. For us, like many others, it was just a weigh station on our trip to Marrakech. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s the best hotel in Morocco, clearly it’s not, but it’s far from the worst. It’s a fine hotel for one or two nights on your way to or from the Sahara and, I believe, the best in Ouarzazate"
 April 2010,4,The best hotel we stayed in during our tour of Morocco,"We stayed in this hotel during a tour of Morocco. Arriving at this hotel after a long day in a tour bus was wonderful. The check in was quick and the rooms were spacious, clean and everything worked. We found the service to be good and even managed to change money after hours, something which had thus far been a problem in Morocco. The food was good with both dinner and breakfast having a very good selection. As with most hotels in Morocco, there are no coffee facilities in the bedrooms."
 March 2010,5,This hotel is fantastic,"Ok. Living as an expat in Morocco for the past 18 months, I can tell you that Moroccan hotels are not great. Service usually is terrible even at the ""5-star"" hotles. However, Berber Palace is an exception. I found out during my stay that I had a serious issue with my taxes that needed immediate resolution. I was 600 km away from my tax attorneys. The hotel staff assisted me by finding some palce in Ouazarzate that could get me the right tax forms and arrange for courrier service so that I could get the right forms (signed) to my attorneys the very same day. Most places in Morocco would shrug their shoulders and do nothing. Ok so my situation is unique. Howver, I can tell you that the rooms are very nice (although with some old decor). The tub however, was…"
 November 2009,1,Potential Health Hazard/Dreadful Service - Believe the Negative Reviews,"Where to start? Let's just say Le Berber Palace is possibly the LAST place I would stay in Ouarzazate. Granted we went in the 'off-season.' And the town really isn't much. It's labeled as a 5 star hotel. I'm not sure what planet that would be on. It was so bad we checked out after one night and took an overnight bus back to Marakech. And we were staying in a PREMIUM ROOM. Here are the highlights... - it's outrageously expensive - the hotel down the road is just as nice for 1/3 of the price. - they say they take American Express but kept telling us that our Amex cards (three different ones) were being declined and that we had to pay with a Visa/Mastercard or cash. It turns out, they had a 'special' machine just for running Amex cards and didn't know how to work it. - the…"
 November 2009,5,Wish I could have stayed much longer,"I only stayed at Le Berber Palace one night, but it was fabulous! The lobby is great and the suite we (unexpectedly) checked into was sweet. (see photos). After a long day of driving through the Atlas mountains, arriving at this beautiful hotel with its spectacular infinity pool was just what the spirit needed. Having a wonderful buffet dinner outside by the pool was just a cherry on the sundae. The only downside was that my stay was so short."
 October 2009,5,Loved it!,"I stayed here for only a night, and really wish I could have stayed longer! I plan on going back just to Morocco just for this hotel!! The grounds were beautifully kept, gorgeous pool and courtyard area, decent bar and loved the dinner and breakfast I had. Staff were super friendly and attentive. I was in a 2 floor suite and it was amazing. Very clean, cute moroccan decor, 2 bedrooms, one on the ground floor and one upstairs. The master bedroom, upstairs, was huge with a large bathroom, living space and bedroom area. Downstairs had another separate living room, separate large bedroom and a separate large bathroom. Rooms came equipped with a plasma downstairs and upstairs, as well as a mini bar and safe. I totally recommend this hotel. You will love it!"
 May 2009,5,You must stay here while in Ouarzazate,"I loved this hotel. It was absolutely fantastic. I was so disappointed that I was only able to stay here one night because I was with a tour group. I cant say enough positive things about this hotel. The pool is stunning ...it's a very hip scene, usually frequented by movie stars due to the 2 studios in town (in fact, we saw one as well!) Sitting by the pool at night under the clear sky on a plush lounge with a cold drink is pure heaven. After a short walk down a garden path you will arrive at your room. There are several winding stairs if your room is upstairs but the 2 bedroom suite is like your own apartment...it doesnt feel like a hotel. The breakfast buffet is huge and well stocked with every option you could imagine. It is great quality food which you can enjoy at the…"
 April 2009,5,Probably the best place to stay in Ouarzazate,"I spent there 2 nights, one before going to the desert and one after. I enjoyed my stay a lot. The rooms were comfortable and clean enough, the staff were lovely, the food was also very good. I enjoyed a lot my stay there, I would recommend it to anyone visiting Ouarzazate!"
 March 2009,3,Not up to par for luxury hotel,"We booked a first class trip through Morocco and this hotel was by far the most disappointing. The room looked like a Holiday Inn, old beds and mattresses, plastic curtains, just depressing all around. The food in the restaurant for dinner was bad. The quality of the food was low and our waiter was trying to teach us Arabic throughout the course of our meal. Breakfast was better but not wonderful. On the plus side, the grounds were well maintained and the pool in the main courtyard was lovely. If you are expecting a true luxury experience you will be disappointed here. We were."
 December 2008,2,"A big hotel, but ok.............","The Berbere Palace is probably the best place to stay in this area. However, we were comparing all our other Riads to this hotel, and it didn't compare. But, we had just spent one night in the desert in a wonderful berbere camp, and coming to a regular hotel with a great shower and hotel amenities was good. We were there on New Years' Eve and there was a special dinner, however, we were so tired, we couldn't really enjoy it. We left the net morning after a good nights' sleep. Rooms are clean - beds are comfortable."
 October 2008,4,All the Amenities of a Large Hotel Combined with the Charm of a Small One,"It seems like they have upgraded the property recently because we found none of the problems experienced by reviewers in past years. Our experience was more in line with the more recent 2008 reviewers. We had what I would call a ""junior suite"" with a good-sized bedroom, a small sitting room and bathroom. The furnishing were new and the room was clean. There is a beautiful pool area as well as other sitting areas around the property. A very nice lobby includes photos and furnishings from desert movies that were filmed in Ouarzazate and, we can assume the cast probably stayed at the hotel as well. The large dining room is very nice, the servers helpful but the food (with the exception of the desserts) was disappointing. We only stayed one night on our way back to Marrakesh…"
 June 2008,5,Magical Morocco,"I went to Morocco on a film shoot and the whole crew stayed at the Berber Palace. I loved many things about this hotel...the beautiful pool, the huge Cabana next to the pool where I could drink gallons of mint tea if I wanted to and surf the net. The food was very good and the waiters were so very lovely. Rooms were pleasant enough. I could actually reach my hand out through my window and pick an orange off the tree if I had wanted to. Strolling through the pathways between the rooms at night was exceptional, especially when all the Moroccan style lanterns were lit . Beautiful flowers and trees all over the place. The staff at the front desk were always helpful and the center of town is just a walk down the hill. I am planning to go back there as I stayed for three weeks and…"
 July 2008,5,Pricess for a day,"One day during my stay in ouarzazte i was passing The Berber palace that i would love to stay there one day..knowing i could never afford that...but not knowing that i really would stay there in the very nearby future, infact i stayed there 5 days after i made this comment. My flight had for the second time this holiday been cancelled, the first time i was offered no compensation, but this time i was offered 24 hours accommodation at The berber Palace, I wasnt happy having my return to home delayed by 24 hours and had no alternative to but to accept the offer. The Hotel is just how I would imagine a Berber Palace to be, every part of where i walked i felt a wonderful peace and calmness, the decor was beautifully elegant, my room was delightfully cool, clean and well equipt, the…"
 March 2004,4,I Liked It!,"The hotel grounds are beautiful. It's very spread out, the pool is inviting, and the food is delicious. The rooms are spacious and clean. Two thumbs up!"
 December 2007,4,Good hotel,"Nice large clean rooms with separate toilet and bathroom. However, the bathroom is rather ""dated"". I enjoyed the breakfast at the hotel. They have a nice breakfast buffet which includes bacon!"
 December 2007,1,Hotel needs refreshing,"Have just returned from a trip to Morocco. Spent 2 nights at Le Berbere Palace. The hotel is resting on its laurels from 15 years ago. The lobby and restaurant areas are fine. The bedrooms are dowdy and depressing, with holes in the drapes which didn't cover the windows. Rotting wood around the windows in the bathroom, a shower curtain that was desperately in need of replacement, inconsistent water temperature in the shower and somewhat threadbare towels. We were told by our guide that there were no other hotels any better than this in the area. Definitely not a 5 star hotel."
 November 2007,3,Was a 5 star... 15 years ago...,The hotel seemed to be 5 stars but seems like it has completely been let down. Everything is old and dirty. We were a group of 3 and all of us had bugs in our rooms. It needs renovation and really fast. What I didnt also like was that the stuff was infoming us who was staying know in their hotel. They told 2 really known hollywood acters but I believe that these are sensitive private information and shouldent be spread by the hotel employees. Breakfast was moderate but not included in the price. A plus is the decoration with many movie statues. Of course no internet in rooms. Try something else.
 April 2007,4,Excellent but let down by the food,"The Berebere Palace is designed as a typical walled Moroccan village, or ksar. The central building contains reception, pool, restaurants etc. Around this, set in beautiful, well-kept gardens are the rooms, in small, 1 to 2 storey buildings. We booked a standard room which was a suite. Very comfortable. Very clean. Minibar in the room. Satellite TV (CNN, BBC world etc). No Internet in the rooms. Service was excellent. There were only 2 tennis courts instead of the 3 announced on the hotel’s web site but they were clay and very well kept. The pool is excellent. Service is excellent and very friendly. The main building is decorated with props from different films shot in Ouarzazate. The bar is good. It’s large, comfortable and has free WiFi access. There is also a large plasma TV…"
 April 2007,5,gorgeous suite,"We stayed here on the advice of friends. it was booked by our guide and so I'm not exactly sure what it cost. We were upgraded to a suite for $10 when we arrived. The rooms were gorgeous and huge. The pool was too cool to swim in March but was lovely. The buffet at dinner and breakfast was outstanding. Ironically my kids liked the simpler 3 star places we stayed at because they were more ""Moroccan"". If walking is an issue, make sure your unit is close to the main building as it is spread out. This hotel can hold its own against any luxury hotel."
 November 2006,2,Too big,"We had a lovely suite, which far outdid the normal standard room we had booked and we were never sure if they had upgraded us or if it really was an average room there! It was a very big hotel for Morocco and the only 5* hotel that we stayed in for the tour. It was also the most disappointing; the staff were very offhand, verging on surly and it didn't have a good atmosphere. In the evening there was a buffet with attractive food, but we both developed gastro-enteritis the next day, the only time we had trouble in two weeks. There was a huge tour group staying, who dressed up in what looked like paper bedouin clothes in the evening; we were glad that they were not British!"
 September 2006,4,Nice Hotel,"We stayed at Berbere Palace as part of a packaged tour, which included dinner and lunch. The facility is very clean and neat. The rooms are spread across the facility in groups of bungalows. Ours was large and quite comfortable. The food buffets were quite good and there was a good selection of choices. The staff was friendly and very willing to help. We had a technical problem with our electrical adapter, and a Maintenance man solved the problem pronto with a custom-made adapter just for us."
 March 2003,5,Amazing beautiful hotel,"My friend and I stayed here for 1 night in March 2003, and it was amazing. Truly a 5 star hotel. More than a hotel, maybe a series of villas. We had just come back from a 3 day trek in the Sahara, and we asked to be taken to the best hotel in town. We were hungry and dirty, and we just did not care about money at that point. With absolutely no bargaining power, we asked the front desk for a discount, and got a room for about $130 US, as I recall, which was much less than the rate he had just quoted us. He also upgraded us to a two story suite, since maybe he took pity on these dirty travellers, and also since the hotel was almost devoid of guests. All the rooms are in their own separate section of villas, the layout looks like townhomes. It is to date one of the nicest hotels…"
