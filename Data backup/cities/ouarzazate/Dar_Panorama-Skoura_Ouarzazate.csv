 October 2022,5,Gem in middle of oasis,We stopped over here for lunch on our way back to Ait Ben Haddou. This was recommended by our driver Mehdi. The owner and the staff were very friendly and the ambience was perfect for a hot and sunny afternoon. The food portions were great and at a reasonable price
 May 2022,1,A DUMP,DO NOT STAY HERE we were part of a tour so no choose FIRSH HINT WAS WE HAD TO WALL TO THE HOTEL AS THE BUS COULD GO DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE The staff we trying to be help full the room the bed was like a slab or stone and the pillows you could slide under the door plus the air-condition do not work in 43c you need that or at least a fan the food was very very basic I would not recommend this dump
 April 2022,5,Authentic Moroccan Guesthouse,"Our wonderful guide and driver included this guesthouse on our journey from Merzouga to Marrakech. We were enchanted by the beautiful landscape which consists of high desert with stunning vistas of snow capped mountains in the background. The guesthouse is located in a valley ( oasis) where an abundance of fruit trees grow. We approached the guesthouse on a winding road through the groves. The guesthouse is built in the traditional style and our comfortable room was decorated with many Berber items. We were served mint tea by Ahmad, Aziz’s son, on a roof top terrace where we had a panoramic view of the landscape. Aziz ( the owner) was extremely kind and welcoming. He invited us to share the Iftar meal ( meal at the sunset to break the fast ) and we were also introduced…"
 November 2021,5,"An absolute oasis in the desert! Warm and friendly, with beautiful views and delicious, healthy food.","We arrived after a long day coming from Marrakech. Ahmed greeted us with a very friendly welcome. He helped us with our luggage and showed us to our room. The hotel is beautiful, with large rooms, gorgeous views of the Atlas Mountains and all the amenities of home. Ahmed invited us for tea on one of their the large terraces over looking a 360 degree view. For dinner we were served a delicious soup, a couscous dish with vegetables and meat with a savory sauce. For dessert we enjoyed in season pomegranate and sliced bananas. The experience has been ideal and I highly recommend staying here."
 December 2019,5,Charming and welcoming,"We were a family of five aged 10 to 83 and had a perfect stay at Dar Panorama. The views were amazing. The food was excellent. Everyone was so helpful and welcoming. We felt like a family. We stayed five days and did some exciting and interesting exploring with a wonderful guide, Mohammad (Chofchuiya) and saw places we never would have known otherwise. He was patient and thoughtful and nothing was too much trouble for him. A relaxing yet exciting stay."

 May 2019,5,Amazing.,"Wow, wow, wow.. What an amazing place to stay, the guest house was such an experience. The food, the service, the views an experience ill remember for a long time. The food was home cooked traditional Morroccan food and you won't go hungry. Ensure you book a local guide to experience the nature and palm groves as it's worth the walk and hike."
 May 2019,4,Friendly family stay,"Wonderful stay in this friendly family run guesthouse, great views from the terrace. Quiet, delicious food. Walking tours through the palm groves to visit the kasbah a must do, also visit the family pottery workshop."
 April 2018,5,Authentic and hospitality,"If you are taking a tour to southern Morocco, do not miss the chance to stay at Dar Panorama. The accommodation there is totally different to any normal hotel we stayed in our trip. First we arrived there we were welcomed by Aziz and his family with a big smile. It took us a few moments to get interacted with the family and felt like home. The food was traditional and tasted delicious, it was our best meal in the tour. After dinner we went to the roof terrace to sit watching stars and enjoying the lovely view of the oases at night. I can't wait to go there again on my next trip. Thank you Aziz Family."
 October 2018,5,Comfortable rooms and a view that's hard to beat,"The room we had was large and comfortable but the best thing for me was the views. I've added a picture of the view from our bedroom, There various places to sit outside and chill out reading a book and drinking mint tea. We stayed one night on route from Marrakesh to Merzouga."
 June 2018,5,"Authentic, family owned gem","We stayed at Dar Panorama as part of a tour from Fes to Marrakesh. It was a beautiful, authentic and unique place to stay. Family owned, the hosts were so friendly, and the view was incredible. Could have relaxed here for a week if we had the time."
 March 2018,5,"Beautiful, Authentic Morocco","Loved this sweet dar! It has an amazing location and a beautiful deck and terrace. It is family owned and feels like you are visiting someone’s home. They have beautiful Berber crafts to decorate the dar and the place is very comfortable and nice. They cooked the most delicious food, and had excellent service, I would highly recommend this place!"
 February 2018,5,Stay at Dar Panorama,We have a lovely night spent at Dar Panorama. Ahmed was extremely welcoming and the views from this riad are stunning. We had a lovely meal and felt like we were in our own home. The beds were very comfortable and the whole stay felt very relaxing.
 February 2018,4,Nice room and great view,"We stayed for one night and enjoyed a nice 3 course dinner. The staff was very friendly and smiled a lot. The hotel offers a great view over the oasis on one side and a rocky desert on the other, with a number of different terraces. Our room was cosy and colourful, and we definitely enjoyed the warm shower."
 December 2017,5,Friendly and authentic,Authentic place with very nice view to the area around. I loved the breakfast in the sunrise. Our room was clean and big. A/C worked well to warm up the room for the cold winter night. Dinner and breakfast was very delicious and more than enough.
 January 2018,5,"Great stay at Dar Panorama, thanks to Aziz and his family","Stunning view from the roof terrace and from the rooms, over Skoura and its palmaraie, with the Atlas mountains at the horizon. Standard but big and comfortable rooms. Very good dinner, and a delicious home-made couscous on Fridays. Very friendly staff."
 December 2017,5,Beautiful Guest House,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful guest house as part of a desert tour. Our room was spacious and comfortable, our hosts were warm and welcoming and the food was amazing, but our favorite part of our stay was the beautiful views offered from our room and the rooftop."
 December 2017,5,Authentic relaxing Moroccan riad,"Amazing place with great views and authentic Moroccan feel. Very quiet and relaxing, we we're one of two couples as the only guests there, it was a very intimate experience. The staff are very friendly and hospitable!! Always greeted with a smile and hello!

Breakfast was an assortment of Moroccan crepes and bread with condiments, really helps you start the day!"
 November 2017,4,Desert trip stay,We stayed here for 1 night during a 3 day trip from Marrakech The location is amazing and great for viewing the stars and watching the early sunrises from the terrace. The service was exceptional and the hosts were always smiling.
 October 2017,5,Wonderful hosts,"The cheeriest, sweetest host around, Aziz, met us at our car and immediately swooped up our 7 month old while we unloaded. He instantly got big smiles as he was one of the happiest people we’ve ever met! The views were stunning, but it is the wonderful family running Dar Panorama that truly make the place special. Highly recommend a stay with these sweet hosts!"
 May 2017,5,Fantastic place to stay!!,"Dar panorama is the perfect guest house in a scenic location. We stayed here as part of a Sahara desert tour and we had an amazing stay. The hosts were some of the most amazing people ever, who were more than helpful in every way! They even provided wifi which is incredible for its location! On arrival they greeted us with open arms and made us feel so welcome, providing us with lovely cold drinks! Later that evening they cooked us an amazing meal. My boyfriend has a severe peanut allergy and was reluctant to try any local food just incase. When we expressed our concerns they provided us with the most amazing salad and endless homemade bread! They couldn't have done any more to facilitate us! We had a fabulously big room with an amazing view! There's a real touch of home to…"
 March 2017,5,Fantastic Moroccan Hospitality,We were greeted very warmly and treated royally. This family run guest house offers great views of the surrounding palmeries and desert with the Atlas Mountains providing a majestic background. The dinner was delicious with more food than we could possibly eat. Huge deck and lounge area featuring beautiful Moroccan decor. Very comfortable.
 March 2017,5,A jewel!,We very much enjoyed our stay here. Off the main drag and so worth it. Quiet and beautiful with such incredible views. Aziz has a fine establishment with excellent pricing for what you get! The rooms are clean and have heat or ac. The food is all home cooking and the portions are huge. Don't pass by on your trip. We'd come back in a heart beat.
 February 2017,5,Cozy,Cozy place in the middle of an oasis. Pretty surreal. You literally feel like you are in the middle of no where. The rooms are big and very eclectic (in a good way). The people at Dar Panorama are extremely friendly too.
 January 2017,5,The true berber experience - incredible people in an incredible place.,"We stayed here for one night on our (my wife, mother, sister and 3-year-old) way to Erg Chebbi. It was wonderful - the views are fantastic, it's incredibly quiet, good/consistent hot water and heat (we were there in January, when it can get pretty cold at night) - and the food was fantastic. Aziz and his family are wonderful hosts; they offer truly graceful hospitality, they know how to make you comfortable but are not overbearing. We were welcomed with tea and Aziz showed us the ""berber cheers"", walked around the grounds, and had a fantastic dinner. It was one of the best best dinners we had during our 5-week trip in Morocco. Everything is homemade from scratch and the bread is even cooked in a wood oven. Aside from the great hospitality and food, Aziz and his family gave…"
 December 2016,5,Brilliant views and hospitality,"Aziz and Ahmed have created a lovely calm, relaxing place in a beautiful setting and very convenient overnight stop off point on the way to the desert. We were immediately made to feel very welcome and as if at home. I couldn't recommended this place more highly. Our room was also very large and extremely comfortable"
 November 2016,5,Dar Panorama : the best views over skoura oasis and the atlas mountains,"Dear Aziz and Ahmad We’ve Loved our stay in the beautiful tranquil paradise. you’ve lovingly created here. The terasses are really special and perfect for relaxing. The food also has been a real highlight. Your cook is a star! And thank you also for all your hospitality and helpful advice, we hope to come back again. Soufiane and Souad (From Khamssa)"
 October 2016,4,Goed,"It is a beautiful Riad. Nice room although in the shower somethings were broken. Just need fixing. Good bed and a perfect view. Delicious breakfast. We were there just a very short time, late night early morning. The staff was friendly. Little different was that it was the only Riad where we did not get tea when we arrived. All in all good!"
 March 2016,4,Great experience,"We spent one night here on the way to the desert (Merzouga). Aziz was very welcoming, the room (Panorama, number 8) was large and comfortable. The views were very beautiful from the room and the terrace. Both breakfast and dinner were very good and the atmosphere was peaceful and serene. A nice place to spend a night."
 April 2016,5,Great family-run hotel that makes you feel at home!,"It was pretty late when we arrived here and the hotel seemed to be in the middle of nowhere, so we didn't expect much. Was pleasantly surprised to find very spacious rooms with great views. The hosts were really friendly and the dinner / breakfast was amazing with fresh, hot vegetarian food! :)"
 January 2016,5,Authentic and awesome !,Aziz and his family are very congenial and welcoming. They are a joy to meet after a long day travelling. The rooms were cosy and large. The evening meal was excellent and graciously served by Aziz in a dining room full of wonderful crafts and carpets. Breakfast was great. We loved the terrace view and being able to get up early and walk to the oasis. Great views of the palmery. Thoroughly recommend.
 January 2016,4,friendly Moroccan family run hotel,"As the name suggests it has panoramic views of the palmery. desert and mountains. Aziz, his son and all his family run this place beautifully.They were friendly and helpful and the food was generous and excellent. Our suite was clean and very traditional with niknaks and pot pouri making it feel like a home rather than a hotel, which was lovely. The two terraces offered up the most amazing views and the stars at night were good too. Ideal position to see the Kasbah Amridil,where there was a very interesting official guide who was called Redar. We will stay here again without hesitation."
 November 2015,5,Aziz is an amazing host!!,This is a family run Maison D'Hote and it is very comfortable but not glamorous. The floors are covered in rugs and the walls with works by a talented naive local artist. The food was fresh and excellent. The views from the terrace over the oasis to the mountains were beautiful. Aziz kept us laughing-a congenial host indeed! Highly recommended.
 November 2015,4,Excellent service mind from the owner,"Though the place was far away from the highway, once you checked in, you felt at home. The owner and his son were very happy to welcome you. Dinner was also great with the morrocian style. Glad to be here."
 November 2015,5,Lovely place run by a lovely family,The decoration in the hotel is lovely and authentic. The room is very clean. I love couscous which was served for dinner and crepe served for breakfast very much. The best thing is hospitality I received from the owner and his son. Highly recommend!!
 November 2015,5,Lovely hotel with wonderful people!!,"We had a great experience in Dar Panorama recently. I felt like I owed it to the hotel to leave a review. Our tour company introduced us to this lovely hotel on our way to Merzouga. All I can say is that the hotel was very welcoming, the management made every effort to make us feel comfortable. The whole feel of the hotel is very authentic with traditional rooms and lounge. The food was nice, the rooms were clean and comfortable. Highly recommend if you are in the area!!"
 October 2015,5,Lovely and authentic,"We had a lovely experience at Dar Panorama. Ahmed made sure we were taken care of, always with a huge smile on his face. We had lovely meals and a very comfortable room with a relatively modern bathroom. This was a great place to stop on our way to the desert. There's a gorgeous terrace upstairs, which gives incredible views."
 September 2015,5,Authentic and wonderful stay,This guesthouse it authentic and gives you a sense of the 'real' morocco. We were greeted with smiles and mint tea in this peaceful guesthouse. Dinner was delicious and breakfast just as good. This place is a must! Staff were wonderful and so welcoming!
 June 2015,5,Peaceful Retreat,"I stayed here one night during a trip to the Sahara. The rooms were stylish and very clean. The views were fantastic from the patio area. The patio is tastefully decorated with Berber tools and art. The owner, Aziz, took time to talk with me. For dinner, I had the best chicken tajine in Morocco. Best of all, the location is quiet and serene."
 June 2015,4,Excellent guest house,I really liked this guest house as the personel there was very friendly and willing to help. It was a little bit hard to find the way to this house in the desert. Conditions are pretty good for Africa.
 June 2015,5,Just great,"I'm happy in every way with my week here. If you want quiet, beauty, cuisine, clean, helpful, friendly ... this may also be for you. I would like to come back with my family and fill the place for another week"
 May 2015,5,Great Hospitality in a real oasis!,"We only passed through the place for lunch, some rest and sightseeing of the oasis. The view is great! Aziz is extremely friendly and his son Mohamed has shown us all the remote places in the oasis. It is impressive how water is managed in the oasis. Mohamed knew everyone in the oasis so we felt like insiders !"
 April 2015,5,Great Place to stay in Skoura,We were able to stay a night here on our journey from the sahara to Marrakesh. The owner as well as his son that run Dar Panorama are soo nice. Friendly from the second we arrived. The Dar is very nice and true to the Skoura area. They have a beautiful view from the top of the Dar you can enjoy watching the sunset. Dinner was delicious and it was just a great evening. Our room was large and clean. We really enjoyed our stay and glad this was a stop on our tour. Totally recommend staying here if checking out Skoura or traveling through. Enjoy!
 May 2015,5,I felt as if I was in a beautiful bubble ...,"We look for many things when visiting what can be termed exotic, but on the rarest of occasions everything falls into place and we are transported into another world, not just the location. I extended my stay two extra nights because I wasn't ready to join the real world yet .. hiding above the edge of the desert over looking the river and the snow capped mountains. The food and welcome were amazing. A thousand thousand thank yous and a nifty happy little Renault will always be a favorite memory of this wonderful guest house."
 April 2015,5,Great stay...,An excellent choice if you are visiting Skoura Valley and also if you are planning a trip to the desert...Amazing guest house with a magnificient view on the Valley... Aziz and Ahmed were very kind and hospitable The rooms were spacious and comfortable Thank you all
 April 2015,5,"A thousand, thousand thankyous","This is like staying with your family, the ones you like. It is a spectacular kasbah with views across the stony ground into the oasis and river. Isolated and the wind howls around the building reminding you that you are miles from anywhere in gorgeous Skoura. The food is sublime, so much of it! The home made bread, the musicians, the terrace, the terrace dining area, the downstairs dining room, the family who run it are all fabulous. We stayed 3 nights and explored the oasis and chilled out in the huge terrace room. The rooms are lovely and comfortable with interesting traditional locks. A beautiful place with lovely hosts, I could have stayed for ever. Brightly coloured lizards are in the rocks on the way in to the kasbah so look out for them when driving. A walk in the oasis…"
 February 2015,5,Wonderful little guest house,"We stayed here during a 4 day tour as a stop off between the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara and what a delightful little guest house it was! A family run, traditional berber house, upon our arrival we were given a very warm welcome of mint tea (obviously!), dried figs and sweet almonds before being shown to our lovely comfortable room. The view from the room was phenomenal...a full panoramic of the snow capped atlas mountains. The roof top terrace offers a full panoramic view of the palmere and at night offers some amazing star gazing opportunities. We were served our evening meal in a cosy little room with an open fire and the food was beautiful. The vegetables and herbs were fresh out of the garden that day and the breakfasts were huge and very delicious! The hosts were always…"
 October 2014,5,Friendly family-run auberge with lovely authentic Moroccan ambiance,"What a treasure of a place run by Aziz and all his lovely smiling family. Simple, but comfortable rooms. Amazing views over the palmeraie of Skoura and the kasbahs. Great simple Moroccan food with the best breakfast anywhere. Beautiful roof terrace and because the auberge is out of town there is no light pollution so lying on the roof terrace looking at the stars was an out-of-body experience. A memorable landmark on our holiday in the south."
 August 2014,5,spiritual night,"very recomendable place. Wonderful night looking at the stars, ecological place with soul and unforgetable breakfast. Its really suitable the name of the place with the surranding. The owner are very kind people."
 February 2014,4,lunatic view,"If you want to polish your sens organs, especially the Eye, don't miss the opportunity to spend some days in Dar Panorama' Skoura, south of Morocco between the Atlas mountains: I have been there between 24 and 28 February 2014, and I have enjoyed the nature in all its beauty including the sky at night with stars"
 January 2014,4,Friendly and Welcoming,"Dar Panorama is a little off the beaten track but is well positioned, on a hill overlooking the river and palmerie. It is a bit of a distance to walk down to the palamerie, but certainly do-able. We spent the evening walking through the palmerie, discovering ancient ruined kasbahs. There is large, roof-top terrace, with panoramic views. Rooms are large, comfortable but basic. The bathrooms are also basic, designed more-or-less like wet rooms. Wifi is available, but rather weak. Dinner was served in the dining room, and was very good, traditional Moroccan cuisine. Staff were very friendly and welcoming."
 March 2014,4,Amazing views and traditional lodging,"Wonderful welcome of mint tea and tasty treats while sitting atop the rooftop terrace. The rooms are basic but clean, quiet, and plenty of room. The best part is the great views from the rooftop terrace. We had a tasty dinner in a cozy dinning room with a real Moroccan feel to the whole place. We only stayed one night but wanted to stay longer!"
 September 2013,4,"Rustic, welcoming guesthouse","Couldn't have had a more welcome reception....mint tea of course, but also a tasty array of appetizer. Rooms kind of funky, but immaculate and very spacious. Great views from rooftop terrace, great wifi reception, excellent food, friendly host....what more could you ask for!?"
 September 2013,4,Berber hospitality and care,"We stayed here as part of an organised tour and when we arrived wondered where on earth we were and why. Any concerns were quickly dispelled by the family who run this guest house - extremely friendly and helpful. Views are indeed panoramic -from the terrace you can almost see forever. The rooms are simple, but ours was a good size and everything clean and comfortable. Dinner and breakfast were provided as part of our stay. Both meals were presented with attention to detail and we thoroughly enjoyed the meals."
 March 2013,5,Wonderful family run guest house.,"We stayed here as part of a tour, but had a great experience here. The family that runs this guest house is very hospitable, and their guest house has an amazing terrace that looks over the entire countryside. The rooms were simple but clean and comfortable, and the dinner and breakfast were great. Would recommend if you are in the area!"
 March 2013,5,Authentic berber guest house,"Had a lovely time here and learnt how to properly serve mint tea. The terrace has a stunning view over the oasis and the surrounding mountains / pebble desert. The staff was extremely kind, dinner was huge and really delicious served in authentic green berber ceramics."
 February 2013,4,Not to be missed,"This is a wonderful experience to be in and with a berber family guest house. Great views over the oasis from the roof top terrace. Rustic decor which adds to the charm. Rooms with on-suite with a big comfy bed. Clean and comfortable. Dinner, bed and breakfast included. Dinner in particular with good and there is plenty to eat. Lovely hospitable family. Not to be missed."
 December 2012,5,Lovely surprise in the middle of nowhere!,"We were driving through Skoura, in the beggining of the night. As we were tired and wanted to avoid landing in a big city, decided to hunt for an afordable and welcoming place. Chance brought us to Dar Panorama/Chez Aziz. It was a great stay. Staff is lovely, rooms are spacious, well heated and well lit (something hard to find in Morocco...), great shower, delicious homemade moroccan specialties for dinner and breakfast. The place has great views, and there are very nice sites to be visited nearby. We loved it and dearly recommend Dar Panorama/Chez Aziz for your stay."
 November 2012,4,Truly panoramic view,We stayed at this small family run guesthouse as part of a tour through the Atlas mountains to the desert. The hospitality and charm of this family was amazing. Home cooked dinner served in a dining room with fireplace to take the chill off the night air. Breakfast was on the roof terrace. The view at daybreak was of the nearby sandy hills bathed in a red sunrise. Definitely a charming place to stay!
 October 2012,4,Great Family Run Accomodation,We stayed for one night as part of a 5 day road trip. It was a fabulous place. Initially we wondered what we were heading to as it is on a dirt road but on arrival we were stunned by the beautiful palmery lying adjacent to this hotel. We wandered thru after our long drive picking and eating fresh dates. The owner Aziz and his son Ahmed were so friendly and welcoming and the food was delicious. We highly recommend this place.
 September 2012,4,Wonderful hospitality,We stayed here 1 night after a restless night's sleep in the Sahara. The room was basic but had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and I got a good night's sleep. The shower worked well but the sink was too shallow and drained somewhat slowly. The view is great from the terrace. Aziz and his family were great hosts - always smiling and they quickly set a table for us in the courtyard when we complained about the smokers in the dining area. They also had musicians come and sing and play during dinner and beyond. Dinner and breakfast were good and plentiful. This was a nice stop on our 3-day journey from Fes to Morocco.
 September 2011,5,Amazing Stay!,"We only stayed one night, unfortunately. We were a group of six in our way to the desert. It’s a family own hotel, in the middle of nowhere, but its well worth it. You are very well welcome, the food is very nice, and the quietness of this place, especially at night, in the terrace, under the stars, it is indescribable. It was one of the highlights of the trip. It’s a great place to choose if you are visit this part of Morocco."
 November 2011,5,Panorama view indeed.,"Amazing place. Owned by the most friendly family, best Tangine served during stay and... Don't forget the sunrise in the morning!"
 September 2011,5,Warm desert hospitality,"We were booked in here as part of a 4 day trip from Marrakech to Fes via the Jbel Sahro mountains & Erg Chebbi. We'd had a fairly long drive via Telouet & Ait Benhaddou so arriving at Dar Panorama was a welcome end to a great day. The friendliness & hospitality from the Berber family that owned the hotel was great, from the welcoming mint tea as the sun set over the neighbouring hills, to the delicious tagine dinner we had later. The room was clean, spacious & the place was beautifully quiet - that night we were the only guests, and as the hotel was located on the edge of the oasis, no local traffic or noise. Breakfast next morning was freshly cooked pancakes, honey, jam & coffee then we were farewelled by the team. A great, friendly place to stay."
 October 2011,5,A real gem,"We stayed here for only one night (unfortunately) on our way to the desert. Of all the places we stayed at in Morocco, it was probably our favourite and we wished we'd been able to stay there longer. It is a small, family-run guesthouse with an incredibly warm welcome, gorgeous views and delicious food. Everything seemed to work effortlessly and efficiently like clockwork. There is a large terrace area with tables and soft chairs where you have the most beautiful views and sunsets. Our room was large, very clean and had a huge en suite shower area too. The bedrooms and facilities don't aim to be posh nor luxurious, and they were more than adequate. The Dar is in the middle of a palmy oasis not too far from Ourzazate and would make a good base if you wanted to explore the…"
 October 2011,5,An oasis in an oasis,"After a very hot long drive over the Atlas , we were welcomed so warmly by Aziz and Ahmed - with smiles and tea, cakes, dates and nuts which were declicious. Yes, it is off the beaten track on the edge of Skoura and it is just a family guest house, but they do it so well. Friendly, efficient and delicious home-cooked food. The best tagine we had eaten all holiday.The room we had was large, clean and comfortable with a good size shower room with hot water. It has no pretensions of being luxury and all the better for it. We stayed just one night on the way to the desert. I would recommend this as a base for exploring this part of Morocco- for say 2/3 nights or just relaxing on the roof terrace enjoying the view over the oasis."
 September 2011,5,Had an awesome time in this guest house...,"It is in the middle of nowhere, which I loved! The owners are one of the nicest people I have met in Morocco! The food was fantastic and the view from the terrace is just awesome!! I can really recommend staying there is you are travelling around the Ouarzazate area. I would not recommend staying in the town of Ouarzazate if you are after an authentic experience - this overnight stay definitely felt authentic!"
 October 2010,4,Best fed and a better sleep,"Aziz and his family make the long drive to reach this guest house well worth the effort. Warm, welcoming, lots of interesting bits and pieces give this hotel a point of difference - the view is truely panoramic and the meals provided were wonderful. It's a bit quirky, it's very real and has plumbing that works...."
 August 2010,4,a gem in the middle of nowhere...but worth staying..,"first of all, you will definitely need your own car to get here...not sure if there are buses that will drop you off in Skoura and if it's easy to take a taxi that will take you there...or the hotel might be able to arrange for pick-up.. spent one night as part of a desert tour we hired with private vehicule...we were the only guests staying that night so had the whole place to ourselves...Aziz treated us as royalty and made sure the whole time we were comfortable and felt at home...I was impressed with his place...more than a B&B, it could easily become a small boutique hotel but he'd have to upgrade a few elements which could be done easily but not sure if that's the concept he's looking for...he collects and restores furniture and antiques from nearby kasbahs so most of the…"
