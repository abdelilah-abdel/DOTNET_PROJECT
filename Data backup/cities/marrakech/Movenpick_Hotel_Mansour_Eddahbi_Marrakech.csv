 December 2022,5,An oasis palace with authentically friendly & professional staff,"Such a beautiful oasis -- gorgeous colors in the large pool, beautiful tropical gardens, real actual art by artists not by hotel suppliers, interesting nooks, Moroccan designs, gorgeous gift shops, all a delight to the artistic eye. Best international breakfast with everything imaginable, energizing fitness classes you can join randomly for joy, and Ahmed, serving mint tea by a blue tiled pool among antiques, tropical leaves, bird cages to set a bit before launching into the city. The staff seemed authentic and we enjoyed seeing them have the freedom to celebrate the advances of Morocco in the World Cup, and felt like we were in a palace."

It s the 2nd time in 2022, we stay with our group at this Hotel, (Daycoval grp, from Brasil) and I can tell you: our group is a big one! In April 2022 with more than 200 guests, now in November around 90 guests. The staff is amazing, beginning at front desk with all of them, and specially Mr Souhail, also the cleaning ladies Sana and Noura - femme de chambres, incredible nice and gentle. Everybody at the restaurant, the Chef at breakfast, Miss Fatima, so so sweet, always keeping a table for me and when I had no time for breakfast as we are always running, she arranged for me a little something to eat, a croissant, an yogurt, anything. So, for sure, next time in Marrakech, I ll stay there, even privaste with my family. Rooms and beds and showers are great too.…"
 December 2022,1,Managers are Rude! Room pictures are deceiving!,The hotel managers are rude and will not accommodate you. The pictures of the rooms are not what the rooms are.

 December 2022,3,New Year in Marrakech,Large French hotel with all the facilities you expect from a 5 star but no real soul. Sadly whilst the grounds and facilities are all you would expect the service leaves alot to be desired. Restuarant/ Bar staff appear miserable and unfriendly and slow to meet the needs of guests.

 December 2022,4,Breakfasts shine,"The hotel is a standard five star hotel. The public rooms are lofty and attractive, but the area in which reception is situated is not well designed, and is inclined to be stuffy. Our room was comfortable and well appointed, although the balcony was too small to take full advantage of. There was always hot water in the shower. A big plus. The restaurant did not offer us an authentic Moroccan menu, which disappointed me, as a first-time visitor to the country. Room service was prompt, well-presented, and tasty, however. The best thing about our stay were the breakfasts, offering a wide variety of foods to suit all tastes, including Moroccan options like jben (a cheese) and m’semen (a bread). We were exceptionally well looked after by Bahija, and we commend her to management"

She is amazing and we cannot thank her enough. Our beautiful was kept clean every by the dedicated housekeepers Salma, Najat and Mina, we had everything we needed. These ladies were so nice that the children would recognize and greet Salma when they saw her. The breakfast buffet selection is very large and had a great selection of food.

Note there is no indoor pool as mentioned on TA page, but the temperature in the heated outdoor pool was very pleasant in late November. HOWEVER! This is NOT a four-star hotel. Most of our interactions with staff left us inconvenienced and with the impression they are either very overworked, unhelpful, or untrained. -Housekeeping was overworked and semi-responsive -One staff member told me to go next door to heat up my baby food while said baby was crying; it would have been nice if they took the 30 seconds to do it themselves -One staff member ""showed us"" where the spa and restaurant when asked by walking us all the way through the hotel before emphatically pointing and…"

They have a lovely swimingpool with good views. It was very good stay , I am so satisfied thank you housekeeping team you're the best good work 😊"
 December 2022,3,"Boring Hotel, not a 5 star","It is a reasonable property inside and is well spread. However it lacks the 5 star touch and hospitality and attitude by far. Staff are too relaxed. The room quality is average. A suite is not worth the money. Does not feel 5 star, many things in the room were looking tired. The food quality and choice is very disappointing. No choice at all. Breakfast was boring. I wouldn’t recommend to stay here. The only positive to this property was the location. My recommendations: 1) increase the variety of international cuisine and for vegetarians, add more food choice. 2) train staff to have a better attitude and care for guests. 3) make changes in the room layout and add bathroom doors for privacy."
 December 2022,5,Great stay,"It was an amazing experience at this beautiful hotel and Bahija at the breakfast, was so amazing , so full of life and always ready to help. We will definitely visit again. The pool is also usually warm and be sure to find the sauna and gym as well."

From the entrance to lobby to rooms this hotel really takes your breath away, we were welcomed by hamza at the desk who has catered for our every need and want (and we are quite fussy) This hotel has to be the best value for money as you get an amazing 5 star service wherever you go be it the breakfast area or pool or spa and valet parking, every member of staff that we met was polite and hospitable.

 December 2022,5,Picturesque!,"If you love photo spots, this hotel is one of the best. The permaculture system in this hotel works well, together with citrus trees that goes to the kitchen, several pools for your relaxing enjoyment, and landscaping where birds can fly free. The housekeeping staffs are excellent. In my experience, Karima is very attentive. The breakfast buffet was marvelous. Even though it is always the same menu everyday, we can choose healthy selections, local delicacies with several different high quality honeys, jams and preserves. The restaurant staffs are helpful, particularly Bahija, Fatima, Meryem, Youness, Haoud Elrddy.

I stayed here for more than a week and it was wonderful from start to finish. The staff were very attentive and helpful. Despite the language barrier, they always went above and beyond to make sure that I got everything I needed (and wanted). The housekeeping staff was excellent, especially under the supervision of Sana (thank you again for the birthday surprise). They always greeted me with a smile and made sure that we got some extra tea 😆 The breakfast buffet was marvelous. It's always the same menu everyday, and indeed, why change something that's already working well? The food is of high quality and I'm glad that they also offer some local…"
 December 2022,1,Movenpick Hotel Marrakech Review,"Good 5* Hotel with 2 star service Hotel is good location. Rooms are large and nice. Bed comfortable. TV not working. Restaurant food - reasonable Restaurant service - soso. Front Office service is very very poor. Except for Ms Hanane & Nezha, the other front staffs are very “cold” and irresponsible. 1-Triple room with only 2 sets of linen. Despite repeated requests and reminders, nothing done. 2-No morning calls for my group on Departure day despite prior arrangement. The worst staff is Hassan (Reception) he has a very bad attitude. Does not believe in providing service to guests. I stay in this hotel with a contingent of 20 guest. I was responsible to provide information to my group. I asked Hassan many questions and directions, he did not provide any. Has a “don’t…"

 December 2022,5,Safe and quiet sanctuary to return to.,"I came for a week on business and brought my 12-year-old son. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating and we appreciated the warmish pool in Dec. Highlight for us was Ahmed the Roi of tea, a true Saharaween and joy to speak with. I speak Moroccan Darija so it was easy to communicate but a smile is all you need. 😊🇲🇦❤️"
 December 2022,5,Experience at Movenpick Hotel Marrakech,It was a really good experience. The hotel is in a beautiful city.

I found the service of the Concierge desk excellent and was my best experience at the hotel! Rafiq, the senior Concierge was simply exceptional! He was polite, patient, and professional! He followed up on every request (and I had several - booking restaurants, Hammam, getting silver ring adjusted, confirming shipping details for carpets purchased, etc) to ensure that everything was done to my satisfaction! I did not have to worry about anything and cannot thank him enough! Lamia (concierge) was very helpful in giving me good recommendations for places to visit for shopping and Hammam.

 August 2022,5,Satisfactory,"The hotel lobby and public facilities are very nice and well maintained. The rooms (our family had two rooms) were satisfactory but certainly not 5-star quality. The furnishings were a bit worn and stained. We were also disappointed that there was no furniture on the balconies which basically made them useless. We enjoyed the swimming pool and surrounding lounge areas and ate several nice lunches at the restaurant next to the large pool. The concierge was very helpful in providing dinner recommendations and arranging an excursion to the Atlas Mountains. The biggest area for improvement is with service. Upon arrival at the hotel, it took almost an hour for us to check into our room. This was at the end of a long day of travel with our young children. Once we finally got into our…"

Stunning public areas, five beautiful pools with really comfortable lounge chairs and cabanas all available to use at no additional charge (exceptionally fluffy extra large pool towels). Perfect atmosphere, great location. But the real shining stars of this hotel are the staff. Everyone really went out of their way to accommodate our folks who are not the easiest! Smiles all around, very helpful and respectful. The dining room staff really went out of their way to assist and serve our group at the breakfast buffet.

I would point out that on Hotels.com and bookings.com you can’t tell that you do not want the non garden view deluxe rooms. We made that mistake but the hotel’s manager bailed out our mistake and really made our stay 10 stars. So to be clear you want the garden view deluxe room. Allaf you are a rockstar!!"
 October 2022,5,CEO Immizwar,"I can’t tell how happy I am to write you this review having enjoyed all your facilities and that couldn’t be possible without your exceptional staff and I’m about to happily state each and one of them: (please forgive if I did not mention some names here) early Az 🙏 Anass, Hamza, Ismail at the front door and that was at daytime, add to them the crew of nighttime Anouar, rachid, hamza and Hicham.

 October 2022,4,Week long family holiday (2 kids under 5yrs old),"Great choice for a family holiday. Both our children have food allergies, and the dining staff went out of their way to cater for these complexities, and there were no issues whatsoever. Massive thanks and gratitude to the following - Diane (Head of Food & Beverages) Sami (Chef) Nizar (Chef) Abdul latif (Restaurant staff) Mehdi (Restaurant manager) Zach (Front Desk) Omar (Swimming pool assistant and waiter) They all made a massive difference in making sure there were no allergic reactions for the kids, thanks so much all!"

 October 2022,1,Terrible service and other issues,Unfortunately this was one of the worst hotel stays we have had. - check in took one hour after travelling all day since 5am with 2 small children. Waited 4 hours for the room to be ready at 4pm - room not what we requested (ground floor suite) it was higher up and awful with one tiny window - cot and single bed not in room as requested took hours of chasing to get it - promised the ground floor suite after breakfast next day. Queued 40m at front desk not ready. Told to come back at 3. At 3 told to come back at 5. - wifi did not work in new suite impossible to stream a tv show or check in flights. Technicians came and went taking a up a whole afternoon no communication and no solution - terrace door did not lock totally unsafe - every interaction with front desk was dreadful…
 October 2022,5,The kids club,Touria was everything and more for us on our family holiday. My daughter always wanted to stay in kids club when she was steroids away from a swimming pool... and that's saying a lot. It was so relaxing to know that our kids were in good hands. Touria also sent me many photos of the kids having a good time. Thank you for all the memories to Touria and the staff at kids club.
 October 2022,3,Not 5 star hotel. 4 star. Really friendly staff.,"A good hotel, but not 5 star. The staff were all lovely but there we're so many little things that just meant the stay was not as good as what it could have been; - The cleaners left our door unlocked and open one day after cleaning - Tv had poor reception in the room - I paid extra for a room with a view, but it was just of a palm tree outside the patio door. I was pretty disappointed. It was not a 'view' at all. I complained about this to reception and there is a clause in the booking that defines the view as the pool or the garden but I felt pretty ripped off here to be honest. - One night we were kept awake from 4am because of a loud banging noise in the building. I complained to reception and they told me it was a recuring mechanical issue. We'd booked the Majorelle…"
 October 2022,5,Amazing Hotel Mövenpick Marrakech,"In September 2022 I stayed in Mövenpick Marrakech. According to my advice and invitation in October 2022 we stayed with 30 special guest at Mövenpick Marrakech. Our guest was invited by us for a very important event. Mövenpick team service, rooms , breakfast, everything was amazing. I definitely recommend Mövenpick Marrakech Hotel. I would like to specially thanks to Mr. Elmzouri Abderrazzak for all his support. Mövenpick will be my first choice in Marrakech. I strongly recommend."

 October 2022,2,Not a 5 star hotel,"We stayed at Movenpick Marrakech for 7 days and were overall disappointed with our stay. Even though the hotel is rated as a 5 star, the service we received was very poor and definitely not one of a 5 star. We noted several issues during our stay, none of which is the fault of the staff working there (the cleaning ladies were very nice and always happy to help) or but more a reflection of how poor the management of the hotel is: - bathroom towels: There’s clearly a shortage of towels across the hotel, which meant all towels and washed and redistributed in the evenings. Times where we would come back to the room and werent able to take a shower. We called reception on a daily basis to get towels and they would sometimes take up to an hour to bring the towels delaying our plans…"

 October 2022,1,This is more like a 3 star hotel,"This hotel should not be parading as a 5 star hotel. The hotel is run down, the carpets in the rooms, corridors and communal areas are worn, some areas have grey tape to cover up things, stains everywhere. The sofa in my room had stains on it. The service in the restaurants is awful - given a basket of bread that had a half eaten bread roll in it. The resort is quite expansive, but unfortunately nothing is really sign posted so you could spend ages looking for the gym, the main restaurant etc. I booked a twin room but was given a room with one bed. The breakfast buffet was awful - coffee and tea machines for hot drinks (very tacky and not what you'd expect for 5*), fruit and veg completely abysmal. Had they presented as a 3* hotel and adjusted the daily rate, then I'd be…"

Kudos to the entire Movenpic family."
 October 2022,1,Horrid Experience,"We checked in to our deluxe room, and it was a horrible stay. First off, the deluxe room building is the furthest building away from the hotel, and by the time we get to our room, the view from our balcony is of a construction site and parking lot. Our room had a particularly strong vinegar smell to it, and we asked to move rooms. We were told that every deluxe room was sold out and we would be able to move rooms the next day. Next day comes around and we didn’t hear from the hotel. Every call to guest services took at least 3-5 minutes until someone answered or called back. We also came back to our hotel room unlocked, and it seemed housekeeping didn’t truly close our door when they cleaned it. On our last night, the A/C didn’t seem to work. We called guest services and the…"

 August 2022,4,Excellent service but property needs some TLC,"The hotel and location is very good but the property would not fall into 5 stars or anything luxury. The rooms need some TLC and touching up. The pool tiles/drain needs to be looked at. My toe got badly injured and on the first day as coming out of the pool, which meant I couldn’t use the pool anymore with my kids with an open wound. I pent half a day at the local hospital to stop the toe from bleeding. Breakfast was very good. Excellent eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and fresh pastries but they need to sort out the earl grey tea supply and stop people from taking 20 tea bags (yes some guests were literally filling their pockets with tea bags as if there is a tea crisis). The hotel grounds are stunning with gardens and fruit trees like it is all over Marrakech. What…"

 August 2022,5,Movenpick hotel,I stayed in the Movenpick hotel Marrakesh for nearly one month with my 8 years old son. The service was excellent. The stuff was really nice. And i want to recommend the kids club who was one of the favourite part of my son journey. They are very professional . They was always happy to have more kids every day . And they do have so many different activities such as painting. Board games. And other group activities. My son speaks English it was hard for him to make friends in the hotel but once he gets to their kids club he didn’t have this problem anymore because the staff they all speak English perfectly and they helped him to make new friends and learn new language to communicate with them. I strongly recommend this place.

The amenities are lovely including multiple pools and the breakfast each morning is stunning. We will certainly be back and bring our family and friends"

With our transportation, the private tour of the gardens, Mosque, and souk. We did not have to worry about a thing! The consistency of hospitality we experienced from the restaurants and bars; was one of a kind. The staff at this property do their job with such pride, love and care.

 August 2022,5,Massage in the spa o de rose,Loved Najia! Great massage that was relaxing and calming. My husband and I enjoyed the experience together in a couples room then jacuzzi afterwards with the light coming through the roof was delightful!
 July 2022,5,In the spa,"We had a royal hammam followed by a lovely couples deep tissue massage with Bouchra & Najia at the Movenpick Marrakech spa. It was firm, relaxing and would highly recommend to others travelling to Marrakech!"
 July 2022,4,"Sensational setting and facilities, modest level of customer attention.",A really impressive and mature environment with excellent facilities. Service in the open air cafeterias wasn’t great to be honest. Staff a little disinterested and/or overwhelmed. But it didn’t spoil the experience as such.
 July 2022,5,Treatment with Najia,The pedicure with Najia at the Hotel Movenpick spa was wonderful. Najia worked very meticulously and carefully and left my feet looking new (and beautiful) again after many days of walking in the Marrakech heat! Najia has expert skill set and I would recommend her to anyone who needs a pedicure!
 July 2022,1,If you after customer service and peace in your room this is not for you.,"Check in was fine after an overnight flight, rooms were ready when we arrived at the hotel, hotel looked beautiful, in the evening we could hear loud loud music in the room, it was from the hotel opposite, it felt like we were literally on the doorstep of a night club, we had booked 3 rooms, this is the last thing we needed with children, we could not sleep till the music stopped at 12am, took 3 phone calls and 2 hours later before the hotel finally agreed to swap rooms, this is the last thing you need after you have unpacked and settled in your room, had issues with air conditioning in the room, engineer came at 11pm did something but make no difference, we ended up trying to sleep sweating in a room with aircon not working, it was horrible. Following morning I rang reception…"
 July 2022,5,Marrakesh vacation,It was excellent especially thanks to Hanane who gave us a nicer room with a view and accommodate us for a late check out since our flight was at 8 pm. As a frequent flyer with more than 4 MM miles flow all over the world I highly recommend the Movenpick Marrakesh!
 July 2022,4,Amazing service from Lamiae and friendly staff,"As this was my first visit to Marrakech, I needed all the advice and local tips I could get. Lamiae, the concierge, was amazing! She gave me great recommendations of restaurants, advice on what to pay the taxis and then the best service of all was when I needed to buy some gifts, she phoned the shop in Menara Mall and had someone ready to help me! It was a pleasure to stay at the hotel. All the staff, from the waiters in the restaurant, to the omelette chefs at breakfast, to the doormen and cleaning lady, were friendly, helpful and very professional. Thank you for treating me so well."
 July 2022,5,Amazing Treatment with Najia at Spa,Najia gave the best massage - didn't want to leave. Be sure to check out the hamam. It is truly an experience. The entire experience was peaceful. She is very nice and wants to make sure you're getting a great service.
 July 2022,5,Recent Movenpick Hotel Stay Review,"I liked the Movenpick Mansour hotel, very much. It is centrally located in the Hivernage district; Other lovely hotels, cafes and easy transport links. The roads are so clean there as well. The route from the airport is so close. I was surprised at the modern architectural design, as well as an unusual discreet entrance. It is a bird in the cage/ garden and fountain style entrance, with a huge bronze/brown automatic curved door. The floors are so glossy, and scent throughout the lobby is filled with the fragrance of fresh roses! I understand why they have a five star rating! The check-in was swift, attendance to take the luggage and proceed to the bedroom was also on point. I had a first floor superior room with small terrace, front facing the garden/side pool area; Just as…"
 June 2022,4,My time in Marakesh,"Beautiful hotel. Amazing breakfast. Accommodating staff. Main pool area could use updating as chairs were broken and/or cushions needed replacing. There’s an amazing spa like smell throughout the hotel, this adds to the feeling of relaxation."
 June 2022,5,On the up and up,"Stayed there 3 years ago, when it was a beautiful hotel ruined by incompetent management. Mercifully,and rather unexpectedly, the top management has been replaced, the staff now feel and act a lot happier, and this time we had a fantastic stay. Rather oddly, some of the in-house restaurants have not yet reopened, so worth checking exactly what is open now. But the breakfast is to die for, the pools are exceptional, and the staff are now friendly and cooperative. The concierge is fantastic, the Moroccan tea delicious, the Spanish restaurant delightful, The position is a little incongruous. In one direction is a shopping mall ( air conditioned, Carrefour supermarket), in the other the roads area bit derelict. But the neighbourhood is actually very safe, and the people you pass…"
 July 2022,3,Assistant Manager Nuzha,"I had an issue upon checkin and the assistant manager Nuzha listened, proposed changes and implemented. She is great in assisting and fixing issues. She was able to attend to my request to change the room in no flash. She is competent and problem solver. Great for the hotel to have someone like her. Other staff, Noufal and Othman, were quick in attending to my room change helping me in sorting things out in no time. Bravo"
 July 2022,5,Najia treatment at Movenpick,"I had two treatment sessions with Najia, massage and facials. Her hands are just magical to say the least. Najia is the queen of massage and facials. I travel around the world and have many spa treatments but Najia is without any doubt the best. Just go try and thank me later."
 July 2022,5,Traitement with Najia,I had a very massage with Najia and the treatment was very good. Najia gave me a very professional and delicate service. I will definitely come for another treatment with Najia before i leave. I recomemnd Najia to anyone who comes here. Thank you

Got a facial and massage it was best the I have had ever. Got a hammam with Hind which was outstanding as well and definitely will be coming back to Najia and Hind.
 July 2022,5,BRILLIANT BREAKFAST STAFF !!!,"I have returned to the Movenpick for my sixth time, and once again the service from the staff was impeccable as the staff could not do enough for us. Yet again, I was incredibly impressed. The breakfast staff were extremely attentive, taking great pride and care in their job and were such hard workers. In particular, My Youssef ( the breakfast manager) and the waiters; Mohamed skiriba, Mohamed kabaj and Bahija, who served us, could not do enough for us, and If we wanted anything, they would immediately try to meet our needs as quickly as possible and treated us as if we were royalty. These workers take hard work and dedication to another level and put it into perspective onto how little we have it in the Uk. These staff put great pride into their job and it shows in every…"
 July 2022,5,Massage,"I had a really good massage with Bouchra, she treated me so well and she was really nice all the time. She did an amazing job, 10/10 recommended!! The message was an hour long and it was completed, full body"

 July 2022,5,Wonderful Hotel,We had an amazing time at the swimming pool and the room was beautiful big shout out to the reception team specially HAMZA because we didn’t like our first room and he really try his best to give us a room with swimming pool view. We really appreciate everything and we definitely coming back again 👍🏻👏🏻
 June 2022,5,Marvelous hotel in a marvelous city,"We stayed at Movenpick Marrakech for our first visit to this special city. The property itself is first class and a great value for the price. Moreover, the service from the team was top notch. Concierge Rafiq set up a guided city tour for us, hosted by Rachid. I would highly recommend that you find Rafiq when you arrive and explain to him what you want to see. Rafiq also set up a camel tour for us, which was also a lot of fun. Go and experience all that Marrakech and Movenpick have to offer!"
 June 2022,5,Spa,Firat day areiving in Marrakech. The weather is hot so think will rwlax at the hotel. Had hammam and deep tissue massage. Excellent treatment especially the oil massage from Naijia! Would recommend her. Very nice experience everall. Thanks Naijia :)

 June 2022,5,Super Bahija.,This is our second time in this hotel and we are definitely coming back. The staff make you feel at home and the service is beyond great. My husband got sick with a sun stroke in the first 2 days and I was alone with my daughter. He could not leave the room. Bahija from the breakfast helped me so good and made me feel less alone. She advised me about what medicine my husband could take and what was good for him to eat. She is a live saver!!! Without her I would not survive these days. She took such great care of us and treated us like family. Amine was always quick to help set our table and offer us drinks and food. Very kind and always a smile on his face. The Manager my Youssef was on top of everything and new exactly what was going on and surely as soon as my husband was…
 June 2022,3,"If you want fancy, look more!","Very nice employees. The hotel is old and need a facelift. The SPA is a little disgusting. People can smoke everywhere, so if you don’t smoke, you will second hand! The breakfast is really good with a large variety of food. The pool area need a better maintenance. The check out was a nightmare."
 June 2022,5,Great stay!,Had a great stay with this hotel. Their staff are amazing. Amazing service from Bahija at breakfast. Salma from the hospitality team. The public areas are beautiful and well maintained and there’s a lovely smell. Thank you for a lovely and lovely time.

 June 2022,5,"Outstanding service, best hotel in marrakech",Excellent work from Leila at the reception and Hanane they are truely amazing ! They have gotten us a room super fast and according to our requirements. And also Muhammed from the breakfast has been super kind and he provided excellent service he actually took the initiative and brought us Tea and orange juice and kept checking on us.

 June 2022,2,Poor service and main pool not available,"I am on my 2nd here , staying at room 3233, I only booked this expensive hotel due to the main pool but it has been booked out for last 2 days for a conference. So all residents have to make do with a really small pool which you see in 3 star hotels at best. I came here 8 weeks ago and stayed at the riad dar anika which service is 10/10. When checking in I was told the pool will be available tomorrow which it wasn't. Also sitting here at the pool restaurant I have has to wait 15 mins to be served and there are about 4 staff and only 10 tables. Not looking forward to the next 5 days at all."
 June 2022,4,"Nice Hotel, But Not 5-Star","We stayed at the Movenpick for three nights and enjoyed our experience overall. The hotel is beautiful with modern Moroccan style, especially the entrance and lobby areas. The pools and manicured grounds offer a lush oasis in the hot desert climate, and the daily breakfast was plentiful in selection and quality (freshly made sfenj Moroccan donuts and fresh squeezed orange juice!). The female concierges were delightful and very helpful in answering questions about Marrakech, assisting with dining reservations and transport. Unfortunately, this is not a 5-star hotel. The rooms are quite worn with stains/tears on the carpet and bathroom tile, and fading and dirt on fixtures (lamp shades, bathroom towel bars/mirrors). The front desk staff were highly unfriendly each time we sought…"
 June 2022,4,clean neat great service,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel where is located about 10 minutes of car ride from the Main square. This spacious hotel consist of several separate quarters so you never felt it's over crowded & only have 3 floors. Room were always clean & bright, at least 3 outdoor swimming pool. I really enjoy their breakfast at Restro Savoy & was very well organized by their manger Myyoussef & Balija. Their English skill was up to the good service standard and great with details."
 June 2022,5,Honeymoon,Me and my husband stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon. Such a lovely and friendly hotel. Staff are really friendly and always there to help. The design and layout of the hotel is absolutely stunning! The hotel is situated near a little mall with lots of food places near by which also a plus. shout out to a lovely staff member called ayoub who works at the om yoga bar. such a lovely guy who made us every flavour of virgin mojitos that we couldn’t find anywhere in this big city. Not only that he was very welcoming from day 1 and always friendly. Thank you to everyone who’s made our stay lovely.
 June 2022,5,Massage by Najia,We had a couple massage in Spa Movenpick. I liked so much the relaxing massage by Najia. Her warm and tender hands and personal attitude for me really nice. Najia is very nice and always ask for feedback. Recommended.
 June 2022,5,"Amazing hotel, even more amazing staff","Movenpick is a very modern hotel, with imponent architecture, fancy and luxurious, bot not stuck up. The breakfast is formidable, infinite options, from typical morrocan delicacies to french pastries. Noteworthy the very kind staff that measure no efforts to satisfy guests, like the cheff who promptly squeezed grapefruits when I mentioned I liked the juice and the concierge, Monsieur Said, who was absolutely fantastic, with great suggestions and finding ways to make reservations at busy restaurants last minute and always asking about my experience."
 June 2022,1,Realistically a 4* Hotel AT BEST!,"I created a TripAdvisor account specifically to warn you against visiting this hotel. I wrote this review after visiting the hotel but it had been sitting in my review drafts since ny visit! There are so many problems associated with this hotel that I just can not mention them all. We stayed here for 8 days. I have split the review into Accommodation/resort, dining and service. I will start with the accommodation/resort: The main pool was ridiculously overcrowded and freezing cold. I have no idea why they did not turn up the heating a bit more. It was really unpleasant to swim in. There was another pool near the Abou Faris buildings, that was even colder than the main one! Absolutely freezing! It was also filled with lots of dead bees floating on the water. The suite was good,…"
 June 2022,5,Miss,"Amazing staff, very accomodating. Hind the Spa receptionist managed to fit us in for a last minute session and really friendly. Amal, the manager ensured we were greeted with care. The massage therapist had magic in her hands! Would definitely recommend."
 June 2022,5,"Nezha, thank you for a fabulous Birthday!","A Big thank you to Nezha for making my Birthday so special! This has been one of the most magical birthdays I have ever had!!!! I would also like to thank Abdellatif, Khalid from the front desk, lovely Bahija who always looked after us at breakfast and finally the hard working girls who cleaned our rooms Samira, Yassmine and Mina! Do not hesitate to book this amazing hotel the rooms are very comfortable and there is lots to do from spa treatments, 3 pools and 2 restaurants."
 June 2022,5,Luxurious experience,"We had a wonderful experience during our stay in the hotel. Particularly the quality of the atmosphere , the service as well as the commitment of the staff . My thanks to HASSAN and ISSAM of the SPA pool for their humbleness, kindness besides that my thanks goes also for the passionate and devoted YOUNESS of the pastry."
 June 2022,5,Fantastic hotel and experience. Many thanks to Laila at reception,We were immediately impressed by the staff at the Movenpick especially being our first time visiting Marrakech . Laila at the reception has been especially attentive catering to our every need aswell as offering recommendations. The lobby area is amazing aswell as the facilities and breakfast in the mornings. Our room was splendid and we enjoyed our stay. Will definitely visit again with family and friends soon Thank you Laila for being a fantastic host

 June 2022,5,Best hotel to stay… specially with small kids.,"Superb hotel with special attention to details towards its clients. The hotel is beautifully designed , it offers 3 different swimming pools and an incredible kids club. Touria, Nezha and Ikbal have been very lovely and caring with our children, creating everyday new games and fun activities for them to enjoy. We also wanted to thank Mme Naima et Sami from the restaurant for the lovely Attention towards my family and to Guillaume, the executive chef that prepared the best breakfast and meals throughout our stay. I highly recommend the hotel, we are definitely coming back. Very grateful"
 June 2022,5,Platinum service from Nezha from reception!,"Another fantastic stay at the Movenpick in Marrakech! This time I am here for my sisters birthday and thanks to wonderful Nezha, she has given my sister a Birthday she will never forget! On our arrival date Nezha wasn't even working, but due to her 10 out of 10 customer service skills, she kindly contacted her colleagues Abdellatif and Khalid to help me make my sisters birthday trip special. I can't thank Nezha and her colleagues enough for everything they have done! Movenpick hotel are lucky to have such a wonderful dream team! Keep up the excellent work guys! ."
 June 2022,5,Massage with Iman,"Literally the best massage I ever got in my life! Thank you so much Iman, leaving like a completely new person! I can’t recommend her enough! I had a traditional Moroccan oil massage and I felt in heaven! Thank you so so much ❤️"

 May 2022,5,Gear Hotel,"Nice hotel, great location, easy to get in and out of the city. The staff was wonderful. The hotel is well maintained. The beds were very firm, The food was good. We will stay here again when back to Marrakech."
 May 2022,5,Amazing staff and amenities,"Shout out to Othmane and crew. I had an unexpected extended stay here due to a covid quarantine and he and his team made quarantine way more bearable. Very attentive, kind, and responsive. Besides the wonderful staff there’s some really good amenities here. I loved the breakfast (which is a massive spread) and the pool / bar. There are at least 3 pools I think, and it’s really nice to sit and take everything in. Drinks are nice but I’ll admit there were a couple of drinks the bar staff wasn’t familiar with (but we made do). Overall great experience and great location. Hotel is able to coordinate doctors for PCR / antigen tests and arrange transportation to airports. They handled everything very professionally."
 June 2022,5,Massage of Najia,"She was a great masseuse, told her areas of concern in upper back and shoulders and she focused on these areas brilliantly. Very relaxing massage, felt very rejuvenated afterwards. Choice of music or no music offered. Would highly recommend!"

 May 2022,5,Best Staff and Hotel in Marrakesh,"It's my fourth visit in Marrakesh and my second stay in Mövenpick Mansour. I've been traveling around the world and I always like to stay in classy and stylish hoätels, and this hotel really really is one of my favorites. Especially the staff here is one of the best I ever experienced. The head of the reception Mrs Laila is definitely my favorite staff member. She always has a smiling face, no matter what I ask for: upgrade for a better room, more service, going to the gym when it's already closed, suggestions where to go for dinner or a to have a drink: she takes her time and she really cares about her guests to have a good time here in Marrakesh at the Mövenpick Mansour. She really is a total professional. So whenever you need help: ask Mrs Laila. This is arabic…"
 May 2022,5,Spa ô de rose,Amazing massage by Najia. I had the treatment with Najia I like it so much .she is very professional very dedicated .I had o lot of massages but it is the best.I recommend everybody to try a treatment with her.
 May 2022,5,Great service,"The hotel has great facilities, tough I couldnt utilise it due to work. Great for families as I could see. Want to extend à thank you to all the service people as they were all equally great and mohamed imad who is the only one I got the name in the end. Thank you"
 May 2022,5,"Amazing stay, thanks to a lady called Hannan","Some initial teething issues (as you would expect from time to time), but I have to say that it was totally made up for thanks to amazing management and certain staff members. In particular, I’d like to say a big thank you to a lady called Hannan at reception, who truly went over and above to rectify the issues and in fact, more than make up for it! Because of her efforts, the hotel eventually exceeded our expectations. Staff members like her are a real asset to the hotel. That lady really deserves a promotion!! If only I could get staff as switched on and dedicated! Overall a great stay. The resort feels excellent value for money, and is stunning, particularly in the evenings after dark. I also enjoyed the breakfast Would recommend"
 May 2022,5,Massage of Najia,"She was the best. The best treatment I got. She’s super kind and lovely and takes care of everything. Go to the spa and ask for Najia, you won’t regret it. Thank you so much for your delicate service."
 May 2022,5,"Visit this hotel, you will LOVE IT!","To help your decision of reading the rest of this review, I will summarise. IT WAS AMAZING! Now, on to the details. When you arrive you will be greeted by a gorgeous lobby and the scent of jasmine flowers, definitely Instagramable. Help yourself to some mint tea if you wish. The check in was quick and efficient and we were soon off to our room which was a garden view. Not the most amazing view but I wouldn't complain. The room is spacious and well equipped. The decor is classically modern with moroccan style oozing from every corner. It has all the essentials you would expect, 24 hour room service, conceirge etc.. it has 3 pools all of which have their own appeal. A lively pool next to a bar and cafe which serves hot stone-baked pizza on demand and then two smaller pools, one…"
 May 2022,5,"Nice hotel, nice city.",At the reception you will be welcomed by the most beautiful smile in Marrakech of Hanane and the greatest charme you will find of Othman. You want to exchange money for a good rate? Hanane is your bank. You need anything during your trip? Othman is your advisor. Both made our stay here in marrakech much easier!
 May 2022,5,Excellent Service,"Reception: Mohssin has provided us with excellent customer service. He had good communication skills, attentive to all our queries and went beyond our expectations. Kids Club: a special thank you to Touria, Nezha and the girls. They were fantastic, caring and has experience with taking care of the kids. My daughter enjoyed her time at the kids club and wanted to go back everyday. They provide great program where My daughter made pizza, played games, was creative and made a bouquet of roses for me. They take very good care with the kids and ensure that the Kids wash their hands. Breakfast: The breakfast was good and had a good selection of pastries and fruits. It was very busy and did not have enough English breakfast tea bag. The hotel: it was modern very…"
 May 2022,5,Massage of Najia,"The spa is fantastic, the deep tissue massage was excellent, Najia in particular is very very good. Thank you Najia. This is the best massage I have had, very professional. I will definitely come back again. Thank yo Najia for the best treatment."
 May 2022,5,Massage of Najia,"Had a great massage best I have had in a long time, relaxing and I was asleep in minutes. Very professional services from Najia. I will recommend relaxing massage when you come to Mövenpick . Thank you Najia for your delicate service."
 May 2022,4,"Overall nice, but...","Good enough location - 10min from the airport + 5/10min from the Medina by Taxi. Overall, very pleasant hotel and good value. Great rooms and very nice breakfast. However... - Staff at reception is extremely slow to take you in charge. Be ready to wait. I mean, patience must be a virtue for you to enjoy that hotel. - The management of the swimming pool is an an absolute disaster. Almost all umbrellas are broken and you wait ages for service. - Half board, it’s even worst. Quality of the food is good and the staff is nice. But dinner take you ages every single night. Also note this is Spanish restaurant, don’t expect Morrocan food."
 May 2022,5,T thanks Najia Movenpiq hotel,Excellent treatment. Very good massage. I was very enjoying the very good service at the spa bi NAJIA😍 i came every ti spa to get a very professional treatment. NAJIA was the best.

 May 2022,5,Iman massage 💆‍♀️,"Very good massage from Iman, and great service from receiption spa Hind. Thank you! Visiting Marrakesh with family and was a great experience. Hotel was very good also with great friendly staff I recommend very highly"
 May 2022,5,Magical city,"We spent 10 days in this magical city. We stayed at the Mövenpick hotel which is very central to all the amenities in Marrakesh. Our room was very large and the balcony (facing the French consulate) had a large terrace/balcony. The room was immaculate clean and this is all thanks to Salma who took good care of us everyday. We specifically wanted to point this out and had the chance to speak to Amina (in charge of housekeeping) who really seems to have everything under control regarding this important function in a hotel. Salma, you made our stay so pleasant and we are so grateful for all your efforts when coming back to an immaculate clean room every day! We would also like to thank Hassan (the SPA pool) for his great service skills and also Abdelharim at the restaurant for his…"
 May 2022,3,"Be warned this is really a conference hotel, not holiday resort","Positives: the hotel was clean, our room was large and well appointed, great breakfast. Location is great as you are out of the bustle of the old medina, but it is v easy to get a cab there - just haggle on price. Negatives: While we were there it was taken over by a huge conference. The main pool was unavailable as it was set up with food stations, so all the loungers were squashed up in the middle pool. The top bar was also reserved for conference attendees. A lot of the loungers were broken, cushions dirty. They were also SO understaffed -this could just be a worldwide problem in hospitality post Covid - but again we think probably because of the conference. The two nights we tried to eat in the hotel only one of the restaurants was open. Don't be fooled by 'Garden…"
 May 2022,3,Nice hotel but not worthy of 5 Stars,"Stayed here for 3 nights in May. Hotel has good facilities with very comfortable beds, however the level of customer service is certainly not worthy of 5 stars. Few examples: - Long wait at check in, in excess of 20 minutes not ideal after a long trip in the heat. - Pool staff unwilling to source suncream. - Main pool shut all day while they re-fill with water, surely this can be done at night? Overall the hotel staff lacked attention to detail shown in comparable 5 star resorts."
 May 2022,3,OK stay… not sure if it’s a 5 star hotel,"Not really a 5 star hotel. The foyer is amazing and The rooms were nice and clean, but ours had a flickering light that was not fixed despite asking. The check in process took ages l was waiting 45 minutes.. the reception team just looked disorganised and then visibly stressed and a bit rude. They seem to be well staffed, but Mixed levels of services from staff… some super friendly and on it… others just standing around chatting and not paying attention to guest so at times took ages to get any service. Breakfast was really good, but the food at dinner time was really bad. I would not recommend."
 May 2022,5,Wonderful holiday,"Very nice view in hotel with 3 swimming pools. Nice place to chill. Highly recommend the restaurant in the hotel, named ""Marcalona"". Staff here are really nice and helpful, especially my new friend Amal😁😁 Good gym with a lot of weightlifting equipment and strong trainer. Professional spa with excellent atmosphere. Imane is good at message skills, i would say"" must try"". It's a fantastic experience in this hotel!👏🏾👏🏾 非常棒的酒店，设施齐全，员工都非常热情，有什么需要，只要叫一声就会有人来了，健身房设备算是酒店里非常齐全的了。值得入住"
 May 2022,5,Very pleasant stay,"The room was large and clean, there is a very nice area around the swimming pool, and the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Outmane, who took care of my luggage on the first day. Also enjoyed the hotel bar and the adjacent restaurants - excellent food, and - to my surprise - even a local beer called Casablanca, which tastes rather pleasant."
 May 2022,5,Movenpick Hotel review,"The room was very clean and spacious! The staff was very very friendly! The night person Nadia , was awesome, she was probably the most helpful person and so professional Zakia and bushra were amazing too and of course we can’t forget Mohammed who also made sure to get everything we needed.definitely going back to this hotel when we visit Marrakech again. Thanks movenpick team from Al nobani family"
 May 2022,1,Worst Hotel Staff (receptionist) Ever,"I have booked this hotel for my parents and I have paid the total amount including taxes through Ctrip. When they were checking out, the hotel stopped them saying that the paiement didn’t go through and that they couldn’t leave. I spent almost 2 hours between talking to Ctrip operator and the hotel receptionist because she was claiming that there was an issue with the paiement. In the meantime, she didn’t want to let my parents leave until the issue gets fixed even though she knows that we already pre-paid the booking. As a 5 stars hotel, I think the least thing they should do it to not include the client in these matters and maybe review and fix their paiements before the check-in or during the stay. Beside that, the receptionist was extremely rude and totally unprofessional. …"
 May 2022,5,Excellent stay,I went to Movenpick on a business trip and I was impressed by this hotel. Excellent hotel and service. The personnel is friendly and very professional. Special thanks to Najia for her dedication and quality of service. Going back to Marrakech I would certainly put Movenpick on top of my list.
 May 2022,5,Perfect massage,I had a wonderful spa experience and a superb treatment by the wonderful NAJIA. I Would highly recommend. Best massage treatment. Very professionally and highly experienced. Great staff and wonderful experience so far.
 April 2022,5,Great hotel! I’ll be back!,"This was a beautiful hotel. We had the two bedroom suite with walkout patio and it was huge! 4 bathrooms and the living area was so spacious. It felt like an apartment. Closet space for your clothes was amazing! TVs in each room. 3 in total. Upon entering we were greeted by a huge tray of fruit, tray of macaron, chocolate and cookies! Impressive’! Our suite was Great for families, lots of privacy. The pool area was breathtaking. I cannot express the level of service you receive while here. Mustapha in the breakfast restaurant was the nicest most gracious host. The breakfast buffet was huge and had everything! Said at the front desk was kind and friendly. The lobby area and grounds are clean and groomed perfectly. There is an ATM in the lobby and they also will convert your…"
 April 2022,5,Extraordinary,"I have loved every thing about my experience, my family and friends were happy as well and excited. I usually don't leave comments however I have to say that Khadijah was more than great she kept asking if everthing was alright and if we needed anything, she's beyond professional and a sweet lady. I'm definitely coming back for both the food and her service."
 April 2022,5,"Good experience for us as a first time in Marrakesh, ond of the best time for my family I def initelyrecommend to ev ery","Top service by Nahima & abderrahim ✅ Very helpful✅ Me and my family super enjoy by the service, the food fresh and tasty, they spoil us big time, The hotel was great good costumers service and very quick response for everything We will come 100%"
 April 2022,1,THE WORST RUN HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN,"The staff were lazy and clueless a typical example of a budget Hotel company trying to go upmarket. we paid extra for a Suite and it had no Air Conditioning so they moved us to another room after arguing for hours, then the new Suite the taps fell off so for two days we couldn’t shower or bath! eventually they fixed it and it lasted 24 hours until they fell off again and we couldn’t turn the shower off so the room filled with steam. A NIGHTMARE and no one cared at all, do not stay here there are fantastic Hotels in Marrakech this is NOT one of them"
 April 2022,4,Great stay at the Movenpick Marrakech,"We just got back from a 7 night stay at the Movenpick. A great property with excellent facilities. Even when busy - the service was great and the staff very pleasant and helpful at all times. We were particularly impressed at the great service we got from the front desk team - Mohssin and Sohail were brilliant and went out of their way to make sure any questions were quickly addressed. The breakfast was also great, with a wide selection of options. The restaurant staff and particularly Naima were wonderful. Naima is so nice, pleasant and helpful - we looked forward each morning to seeing her. She's a true asset to the hotel. Overall a great stay and we are already planning to return next year. Thanks Movenpick - see you soon."
 April 2022,5,Lendani,I train at the Movenpick gym for almost 4 years now! Very professional team and wonderful spaces! Big swimming pool and cool vibes. Special thanks to Coach Amine for making everyday enjoyable and for the wonderful boxing sessions.
 April 2022,5,Beautiful hotel and phenomenal staff!,"The property is stunning, with beautiful fountains and intricate decor. The room was clean and cozy, and had a small patio to enjoy the garden area beside the pool. Most of all, the staff was friendly and accommodating. Especially Laila, who served us at the pool side restaurant. She was attentive and kind and we enjoyed meeting her."
 April 2022,5,Excellent stay at Mövenpick,"Hotel was excellent again as always, beautiful pool, rooms, surroundings and fitness. Special thanks to Anas who makes sure you are as comfortable as can be by the pool, nothing is too much to ask. And to Abdou the fitness coach eho makes your workout that much interesting 🙏🙏"
 April 2022,3,General get away,"I totally recommend Movenpick while in Marrakesh. The hotel and rooms are comfortable. I wouldn't recommend the buffet, bad food and bad service. Go elsewhere. I would recommend the breakfast however, good food and good service by Mohsive and Licham. If you want this to be a pool holiday however, be warned towels at dawn, limited sun loungers and parasols and plenty of kids to keep the noise level up!"
 April 2022,5,Great Hotel,"Spending whole the month of April in this great hotel. The location is perfect, the food is perfect (nice iftar buffet) & the client service is great. Thanks to the reception team, the hard working guys at the swimming pool & the Spa team (Fatine & Hind) to make it even more enjoyable!"
 April 2022,2,Pretty on the outside only,"Read the negative reviews. They are reflecting the truth. Quality if the hotel: The hotel looks amazing from the outside. The lobby is incredibly beautiful. At first sight this continues throughout, but then scratching only very little under the surface you will find that it was extremely poorly maintained. The loungers by the main pool are all broken. Their mattresses seem intact but never cleaned. The day beds once had cloth shades that now are all damages so that only very few even have them and those that do rather resemble little make shift tents than day beds. The number of umbrellas by the pool is very limited and most stands are damaged and not properly maintained. Even in the rooms the toilet seats have scratches. House number 7 is facing a night club and the music…"
 April 2022,5,What a fabulous trainer!,"I would like to thank Amine for his hard work, to raise my limits and keep challenging me, just the right combination of push and encouragement. And very adaptive to the materials and space at hand! Well done, Amine."
 March 2022,1,Avoid this hotel at all costs,When we arrived the room smelled TERRIBLE like sewage. AC did NOT WORK - the hotels front desk staff was extremely rude to a level where we had to leave the hotel. Disgusting experience and the hotel didn’t bother to amend the situation. AVOID. We were in room 2317. Expedia wasn’t helpful either in doing a refund and we stated at la Mamounia instead.
 April 2022,5,Coach Amine is AMAZING!,"The hotel’s gym may not have all of the equipment in the world, but it sure has the most attentive staff. Coach Amine is very keen on helping you achieve your goals by devising a workout for you, adjusting your form, and pushing you to your limits. His attitude is always positive and he always brings a smile to your face!"
 March 2022,4,My Experience,"Great location, easy to get in and out of the city. Have never had a bad experience and it’s right in the heart of city, so you can walk to everything. The staff was wonderful. The hotel is well maintained. The beds were very firm, too firm for my liking. The food was good. I, especially, enjoyed the view of the sunset."
 April 2022,4,Comfortable stay,"We stayed here for 5 nights in April and extended it because of relaxed atmosphere and location. This is our second visit to Marrakesh first time we stayed in the Medina but chose this time to stay outside and it was a correct decision. The area around Movenpick is calm and open, walking distance to most touristic places. The hotel itself grows on you ; when we first arrived we didn’t like it and found the staff aloof but soon we started to like it and enjoy. The breakfast at the hotel is excellent and the staff are very helpful; right from Fatima who serves delicious mint tea to chef Walid and Nora who makes good eggs and then Skiriba to name the few made every breakfast morning memorable. We will stay here again when back to Marrakesh."
 April 2022,5,Highly recommend,Mohamed skiriba top 10/10 Very helpful and kind. All staff are very polite and treat everyone with respect. It’s our second visit to the same hotel and I would definitely be coming back again in future.
 April 2022,5,Lovely stay,"I totally recommend Movenpick while in Marrakesh. The hotel and rooms are super comfortable and there are 2 great malls in the neighborhood. Fatima Ezzahra and Amine, from the breakfast team made me and my mom feel like home everyday. Special thanks to them and the amazing concierge that helped us a lot with a hammam reservation."
 March 2022,5,First time at Movenpick (and Marrakech) and not the last!,"This is our first visit to a Movenpick and to Marrakech itself! What is great about the hotel: - Breakfast is great, and the service is amazing! (Shout out to the staff that looked after us - especially Moulay Yousef, Skiriba and Karim!) - Great location, we walked to most restaurants in the evenings - Good sized pool - Good sized rooms - Good bar area, we were able to watch the football - Staff, very helpful and friendly. - Front desk made some great recommendations to local spas. Minor improvement area would be that the hotel could do with some minor updates as you can see some wear and tear. But this is very minor given COVID. So well done to the team for making our stay a memorable one! Best Steve (Room 2302)"
 March 2022,5,Never want to leave!!,"This hotel is so amazingly beautiful!! Its very well appointed from top to bottom. If that wasn't enough, the service is peerless. Laila in the pool area was attentive from day 1. I spent lots of time poolside and Laila remembered what food I liked (with additions and substitutions) and my very own concocted drink. Eventually we called the drink ""Another One"" because that was the way we referred it to it. Would definitely stay here again!!"
 April 2022,5,Delightful,"Staff especially Moulay yousef, skiriba cavalier and karim who greets us in the morning for breakfast are outstanding, making sure we start the day right. Hotel is clean but in some areas like pool could be updated. Try to get room facing the pool area as they tend to get better natural light."
 April 2022,5,Thanks Laila,"I had such a delightful service with laila this week she was so welcoming and delightful, always with a smile on her face and providing such a great service and made sure me and my wife had the best time ever, I would like to thank her so much she needs a promotion!"
 March 2022,5,The experience in Movenpick hotel Marrakech,Karim -fatimzqhera-skiriba 10/10.

 March 2022,5,Marcelona Team are the best,"The facilities and the lobby area were truly amazing. Breakfast was really great and contains various kinds of food that will satisfy everyone. Special and big thanks to the most amazing staff of Marcelona restaurant: Sukaina, the manager and the rest of the team. We chose to celebrate our Anniversary with them and they did amazing job. It was truly beyond expectations. This night will be memorable for us all the time. We really thank them from the bottom of our hearts. Will definitely come back"
 March 2022,5,Still fantastic and now even better,"Re-Opened after the stupid Covid scare that every government fell for (due to media hype), this excellent hotel is back and as terrific as ever. But I wanted to recommend the Spanish restaurant here which I didn't like much beforehand but now has a new chef and is absolutely excellent. Worth a trip if you're not staying here"
 March 2022,5,Amazing experience,"Great staff very helpful, Naima @ Breakfast was so professional big up to SAAD @ the Bar a wonderful host, was so good on Friday DJ fired up the place, Othman @ the pool was top notch the room was spacious and clean overall an amazing weekend spent in Marrakech with the family will definitely comeback thank you ALL for your kindness"
 March 2022,5,Nice hotel,I would definitely recommend staying here. It is well located with a nice variety of restaurants within walking distance. We felt perfectly safe walking after dark. My most important consideration is cleanliness and the hotel is spotless. The breakfast buffet is excellent and I love the espresso/coffee/hot chocolate machines. My espresso was very good. I also appreciate having a robe and slippers. It is things like that which elevate the experience. Some VERY MINOR suggestions to improve. The lighting in the bathroom is not adequate. There is a nice magnifying mirror for makeup/shaving but the light is on the other end of the counter so it is un-usable. Things like hair dryers should be checked and working. The built in was not functioning and they had to bring me 3…
 February 2022,4,Nice Hotel,"We stayed at the Movenpick for a week mid February and overall we had a good time. There was an issue regarding our rooms when we first arrived but this was quickly resolved by Hanane who was extremely helpful throughout our stay recommending restaurants and places to visit etc. The hotel is located in a lovely area, Hivernage which is just a 5 minute drive from the City Centre, Medina etc. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel which are very good, Le 6, Dameh and Dar Rhizlane, we always felt safe walking to and from the restaurants in the early evening. We ate at the Spanish Restaurant in the hotel on our last evening and I have to say we were very disappointed. We live in Spain for 6 months of the year and it was possibly the worst…"
 March 2022,5,Best hotel! Thank you Hanane!,"This has become my favorite hotel. The more I come here, the more I appreciate it. It really is a pearl and that’s because of the staff. I would like to put Hanane from the reception in the spotlight. What a great and wonderfull young lady. So warm, so helpful and very professional. Every hotel dreams of such a colleague in their team. She was there for us every day when we booked an extra day. Every time with a big smile and asking how we were doing and if we need something. Once you're here you don’t want to leave and that's because of the staff. Thank you Hanane, you are the sunshine of the hotel. We will leave in a few days but I’ll be back very soon!!"
 February 2022,5,Beautiful hotel and staff!!!,"It is very good to spend vacation in this hotel Good behavior by the staff. Hanane from the reception is very kind and friendly. Thans oui for your help. And I like to mention the brilliant waitress, Jihan, who treated us comfortably I recommend you to spend your holidays in this hotel."
 February 2022,5,Fabulous stay at the Movenpick,"We stayed at the Movenpick over the kids half term holiday and upon check in, the staff were so welcoming and we were given an upgrade, which was unbelievably kind! It was without a doubt, the nicest room we have ever stayed in. The lifeguard at the pool was so helpful in getting sun loungers and towels ready for the day in the sun by the pool. All of the waiters by the pool were great too. Breakfasts were lovely with fresh orange juice, eggs made to order and plenty of options for the kids. The interior design of the hotel is beautiful, with so many areas to relax and take in the surroundings. Would highly recommend, we had a wonderful stay."
 February 2022,5,Very nice experience.,This is our second time here. Excellent experience. The location is very good. The staff is professional.

We will come back"
 October 2021,5,"SPA- Hammam,Massage and Pedicure",Spa- I had one of the best spa experiences at the Movenpick hotel spa. The hammam bath done by Hind left my skin soft as a you know what and the massage and pedicure by Najja was relaxing. These ladies were professional and went out their way to make me comfortable. If you stay at this hotel please check the spa out
 October 2021,5,Excellent,Really enjoyed the stay. Hind from recepon and Buchra from guest relations were outstanding. Staff great in general. Surely would recommend. Breakfast was not bad but could be improved. Room was very clean. Location convenient.

 October 2021,5,Amazing,"Our 5 days at the Movenpick Marrakech were absolutely amazing . The hotel is very big and gorgeous as we wanted. We were so happy to wake up there every morning . The pictures on internet do not show all the beauty of it as we were absolutely WOWed by it when we arrived and saw it in real life. It has got a good location, lovely restaurants, 3 pools and a spa . The service was top class. We felt like celebs. The breakfast was really good, big choice and stuff was helpful. I want to thank Nezha at the reception as she was extremely kind and helpful and upgraded us straight away for a lovely room with a terrace and a nice view for my partner’s 30th birthday. We also received a nice cake to our room for the same reason which was lovely. At the SPA I would like to thank Najia…"
 September 2021,5,Wonderful visit!,We had a wonderful time at the Movenpick! Gorgeous grounds! The staff were very friendly. Make sure you check out the quiet pool behind El Medhi. Thank you to Hanane and Nezha for the wonderful service!
 September 2021,5,Lovely spa,"The hammam experience from Himd was fantastic and relaxing. The massage and manicure from Fatine was also wonderfully fantastic. The prices were higher than I'd like to spend considering the facilities, but that's what these type of hotels tend to charge. Regardless of my comments, I left the spa feeling incredibly relaxed and refreshed. I highly recommend."
 September 2021,4,Disappointing but still great,"There were elements of this hotel which were disappointing - it’s massively overpriced for food and drink, only 1 out of 4 restaurants were open and it was not a good restaurant for a vegetarian!, despite it being advertised as an English speaking hotel we actually found very few staff spoke English, and breakfast was hit and miss- sometimes they would have certain items, other mornings they wouldn’t. BUT. The location was excellent. The room was beautiful and immaculately clean. The lobby/foyer was magnificently decadent. The pool staff were lovely and very attentive. The spa was great, staff were friendly and we had very relaxing treatments. Would stay here again but knowing we must eat out at restaurants rather than expecting to eat in the hotel."
 September 2021,3,A Movenpick standard despite a disappointing breakfast,Not a big fan of this kind of hotel. No surprise at least. Breakfast is below average and the Spanish restaurant is overpriced. The rest is OK. It would need some refurbishment but location is nice and staff is helpful. The trim we had lacked of natural daylight but all amenities were not ok.
 September 2021,5,I visited the holtel twice this summer,"I honestly was blown away, the hotel is amazing it has a great pool I was also impressed by the stuff they had a manager called Saad i gues he was so friendly and made sure that we got all we needed Thank you see you next summer"
 September 2021,5,The best hanane,"we were at the movenpick hotel in marrakech it's been three days to just see the hotel or drink something thanks to hanane from the reception who offered us a good price and showed us a beautiful room in the Mamoun building with a garden view, we took two nights at the hotel hanane helped us with several other requests I would like to thank her for her quality service and I recommend her service 100% hanane see you soon"
 September 2021,3,We checked in the receptionist her name is Hanane gave us wrong rooms,"The receptionist Hanane was an unprofessional person we told her to give us rooms we've booked which are with a pool view and king bed rooms apparently she gave it to other guests! So she is a very bad image&reputation for a five stars hotel! Thank God Laila was such a sweetheart,professional and so kind and helpful. Otherwise the hotel overall is a very nice hotel all staff were lovely. Would definitely come back to meet persons like Laila at the reception and others but Hanane should at least get a warn from her manager so she doesn't do the same mistake with other guests! Thank you Movenpick well come back soon!:)"

 August 2021,5,Excellent Stay,"A great place to stay in Marrakech. This is a palatial property with beautiful well kept gardens and large and comfortable rooms in several buildings. As Accor Gold member was upgraded to a Deluxe room at check in. Room was huge with a large balcony, that was great for either relaxing or dining on, large bathroom with double basins, huge walk in closet and Nespresso Machine. All the staff we met were friendly and attentive, especially the restaurant and bar staff. Despite the Covid situation and 9pm curfew, the hotel does its best to serve an excellent buffet breakfast and all day meals and drinks by the pool. I particularly liked the spectacular lobby, the gardens filled with olive trees. rosemary and lavender, the bathroom amenities and the wonderful breakfast, enjoyed…"

 August 2021,5,Love Moroccan Hospitality,"We stayed here for 2 nights as a family of four, we arrived early for check in at 12pm we were first greeted with Moroccan green tea which was delicious and much needed from the 47c heat outside! We checked in and within 15 minutes we were taken to our room and shown were breakfast the pools and kids clubs were. We chose to stay in a Prestige Suite and wow we were blown away by the size of the room, the modern clean decor. The suite has a large living, washroom, bedroom with a walk in closet and a huge bathroom with a lovely bath in the middle and separate shower and toilet. The balcony had both a relax sitting area and dinning area. This has to be the best room we have ever stayed in! We really didn't want to leave the room! As it was my birthday the room was decorated…"
 August 2021,5,Moroccan Excellence,"We simply love the Movenpick hotel here in Marrakech and we would not choose any other hotel. We travel to Marrakech for our business regularly, twice a month on average and we always stay at the Movenpick. The hotel is conveniently located, being around 10 minutes from the airport, 10 minutes from Gueliz (the shopping area) and around 15mins to the main market square. The hotel is beautiful, as soon as you pull up to the entrance you can see the lovely architecture of the hotel whilst being greeted by the door staff and a Moroccan tea. As you walk through the foyer you feel a sense of tranquility and calmness, as the flowing water features in the hotel bring you peace. We'd like to make a special mention to the wonderful staff at the front desk, namely Leyla and Hanane, both…"
 August 2021,5,Very nice family hotel,"Stayed at the hotel for 1 week, very good customer service at reception especially Hind who was really helpful and went the extra mile. Munir collected our luggage and always happy to assist. Anas on the pool side was extremely friendly. Hotel management need to consider providing umbrellas on pool side as not sufficient available. This is basis items that should be available for customers to enjoy and relax at the pool. Would highly recommend hotel and in good area."
 August 2021,5,Vaycay!,"Best hotel ever ! This was our second time visiting this beautiful hotel. The service is allways on top. And the staff is very helpful and nice .

 July 2021,5,Wonderful stay!,"A peaceful and beautiful hotel with quality amenities and a strict respect of covid 19 precautions. The staff is caring and very helpful. Thank you for making us feel like at home, we’ll be back soon :)"
 July 2021,5,A wonderful holiday,"It was a really nice experience visiting the movenpick marrakech everything was on top; the staff, the emplacement, the equipments, there was so many pools, a fitness spot, and a great breakfast for all the tastes so many choices there! Me and my fam enjoyed every moment there, I want to thank everyone for the welcoming! So With no doubt I recommend this place👍🏻🌸"
 July 2021,5,Amazing Service,"La Movenpick is not only a beautiful hotel but also comes with amazing staff as well. Ms. Hind, at the front desk, was the first person to formally welcome us and she is amazing! She was so patient and helpful when answering all of our questions. My boyfriend told her it was my birthday, and she made sure we were given the best service. You can tell she puts forth a lot of effort to make sure guests enjoy their stay. Our room was beautiful and so clean. I hardly write reviews but I also don’t want anyone to overlook this hotel."
 June 2021,5,Great Stay,"This is a great hotel, as a previous post says it truly has ""mind blowing customer service"". I would like to thank ALL the staff, especially Laila at the front desk she was the first person to formally speak to us when we arrived and she made sure to help us with all the questions we had and ensured a speedy check in which we greatly needed as it was a long flight and we just wanted to go to our room and rest."
 July 2021,1,Worst experience in all Accor hotels,My worst experience in all movenpick hotels as well as ALL accor hotels. The lady in the reception her name is Hind was too rude with zero hospitality skills and not even smiling. I asked for my usual upgrade as gold accor member and she refused. She was so impolite and she didn't even provide the welcome drink that is granted for accor members worldwide.
 July 2021,5,Mind blowing Customer Service.,"Having visited many Marrakesh’s hotels for the past two decades, i have to admit that Mövempick staff are amongst some of the finest in the city. Particularly Miss Hind and Mr Mohssin, those two lovely front desk assistants are second to none. Nothing was too much for them and going the extra mile seemed to be a natural way of doing things. As a Moroccan myself, i am used to the kindness and hospitality of my people but those two surely have surpassed the national average of kindness. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. Allah, Al Watan, Al Malik. ❤️🙏🇲🇦"
 July 2021,5,Excellent home away from home,This is my 5th time to stay at Movenbic Marrakesh..with greatest thanks and appreciation to Miss Hanan at the reception for great service and making me feel at home. The entire hotel staff and services personnel are great help and made my stay most enjoyable with their greetings and smiles . Strongly recommended ...it will always be my place to stay in Marrakech . Eid Mubarak to All.
 July 2021,5,Laila Laila Laila!,"This is the second time we have booked at Movenpick in a 3 week period. The first time we met Laila she was amazing, took care of us super friendly and made us feel very welcomed. The amenities in the hotel is fantastic btw. For our second booking here we were lucky enough to see her again. It felt like coming home and seeing family. She is truly an asset to this hotel and made our stay very enjoyable. From booking the same room, remembering our names, offering to sort out our covid tests and much more. Thank you Laila, you really made Marrakech memorable and because of you we will always be choosing Movenpick when we are in Marrakech in the future."
 May 2021,5,Perfect service,"My wife and i came in marrakech to get way and Our stay was perfect! The hotel is very beautifull, the pool is good place to relax. The service from Leila, Hohssin, mohammed was incrdible! I would return without hesitation! They aldo reserve an hot air ballon excursion!"
 June 2021,5,Amazing hotel with top service,"I am short of words to describe our stay. It was a great experience. The hotel, location and staff were all 10 out of 10.

The staff are very friendly and helpful, won’t left me lift a finger to get my luggage, the property was nice and clean, the room was beautiful and I enjoyed sitting on the patio. The breakfast bar had everything you could think of and was included in the nightly rate. They even allowed me to do my photoshoot on the property. This was my first visit to Africa. WiFi works great. Definitely recommended."
 May 2021,5,I had the best time!,This is an amazing property! The customer service is awesome. Great service from the front desk staff Driss and Hanane. I had a group of 19 Americans with me and they loved this hotel and the pool!!!!

Staffs are so friendly.And I wanna give credit to Mr. Skiriba who assist us in breakfast buffet,also to the room attendant who assign in room#6107(dated May 13 to May 16, 2021) I really forgot to ask her name but she's really nice and doing her job very well.I'm looking forward to visit again next vacation 😊thank you to all the staff and the management of the hotel."
 May 2021,5,Leisure trip,"Staff was attentive and Accommodating. The rooms were clean the food was great the service was awesome! The supervisor or manager of the restaurant made sure there was something for me to eat because there was nothing on the menu that I wanted.

 May 2021,5,Amazing experience,Very nice hotel. Professional helpful staff (especially thx to Lella on reception). Very tasty breakfast and nice dinner. Big beautiful green territory with 3 heating swimming pools. The rooms are good furnished.
 May 2021,5,You must stay here when visiting Marrakech!!!,"This place was beyond amazing! There are soo many facets to discuss on why you need to stay here when you come to Marrakech. First, you are welcomed by the most stunning property with luscious gardens ample space to relax and multiple pools to enjoy. The location of the hotel is excellent as well close to the hustle and bustle of the medina, but not too close that you can have time to relax and get away from the craziness. What really sets this hotel apart is the staff. The staff, every single one of them accommodated us almost as we were their own family. A special thank you to Nezha, Abdellatif, and Mr.Khalid from the front desk and Mr.Omar from the restaurant they went beyond our wildest expectations. Throwing us a party with a cake when they found out there was a graduation…"
 May 2021,5,MUST STAY!!,"Movenpick is like an oasis you return to after a busy day. Leila checked us in at reception, and from our fantastic interaction with her on our first day, my husband and I knew we would love our stay. The staff is exceptionally nice and friendly. The dinner at the restaurant was so incredibly delicious. The hammam spa and massage was everything I wanted after our trip to the desert. There are touches all around our room that made us feel like we were at home away from home. And finally, the safety measures instilled in light of COVID, from the hand sanitizers all around the hotel common areas to the small bottles provided for each guest’s personal use, made me feel safe to stay here during a pandemic. The next time my husband and I visit Marrakech, we will definitely come here…"
 May 2021,5,What a fantastic stay!,"This hotel is absolutely stunning. The architecture, the details in the design makes this hotel remarkable. When you first arrive your pleasantly greeted by remarkable receptionists. I had the honor to be check in by Hind. Her professionalism, grace and ability to accommodate my needs truly left a smile on my face. The suites are so luxe and sophisticatedly designed. I also appreciated that the room service and the dinning accommodating the Ramadan time schedule. You won’t regret staying here and you are certainly in good hands if Hind is your receptionist."
 March 2021,5,My stay was excellent,"My stay was excellent because of the amazing staff. also the people in restaurant and room service go above and beyond. The hotel itself needs a little upgrade and they need more choice for breakfast, it was a little struggle with the choice : more cheeses, more cooked potatoes. The location of the hotel is in the new city but we walked daily to the old city Medina which took about thirty minutes. We tried out the gym and it had all the equipments to do an intense workout. I would definitely stay at this hotel again! The dessert place opposite the hotel is a must place to visit as well!"
 May 2021,5,Fantastic stay,"Just want to say thank you to everyone at the movenpick, from nousra at the front desk, the fantastic and very accomodating chef, the staff in the kids club. My husband and I, had a fantastic stay at the hotel as did our two small children. The hotel has maintained its high standards and hospitality despite the recent global issues. It is a perfect location from couples young and old, families or singles. So close to all the local amenities and the staff by the door are always on hand to help. Highly highly recommend we didn't want to leave. Hope to see you all again soon."
 March 2021,5,Just perfect,"Everything at Movenpick Marrakech is perfection from start to finish. From the moment you set foot in the door, you are treated like what I can only describe as royalty, yet without pretention. I have stayed at this hotel looking for a rest after a big period of stress at work, and it was a great choice for a total relax. Big thank to Hanane for everything."
 April 2021,5,Mövenpick Marrakech,Moustafa khoukh is a very enthusiastic and good person who works very hard since my tine here I’ve been very pleased and felt very comfortable and so is Oumaima a very hard worker and a kind employee as well
 March 2021,4,Two-night business stay at Mövenpick Mansour Eddahbi,"We had a two night stay at Mövenpick Mansour Eddahbi during our business trip to Marrakech and we found the hotel to be pleasant. During our check in, we were welcomed by lovely Ms. Hanane at the reception who helped us with everything we asked for. The rooms are large, newly renovated, and though missing some amenities the exceptionally large marble bathroom and the well kept hotel grounds made up for it. Our stay was during the Covid pandemic and the hotel had plenty of hand sanitizing stations scattered generously both indoor and outdoors. All the hotel staff wore masks and the restaurant had signs on the floor and barriers to keep guests at a safe distance from each other. Greetings and many thanks to Ms. Hanane at the front desk for helping us with great kindness and…"
 March 2021,5,Great service in the challenging time of Covid19,"I am writing this review while still staying at the hotel, because I was simply amazed by the service quality. From check in to cleaning to restauration, all staff are respecting the hotel and gov. sanitary instructions. At breakfast this morning, all tables were continuously cleaned and disinfected after every use. Staff were wearing masks properly, and providing amazing support to guests. Special thank you to Mrs.Naima who took very good care of us, always there to help and support. Big thank you to the director of accommodation for his special attention offering us free drinks delivered to our room."
 March 2021,5,Beautiful stay,"We were truly impressed with the friendliness of staff and their professionalism. The receptionist was great and made us feel truly welcome and went the extra mile to decorate our room as we were newly wed. The spa was brilliant,we had a hamam and massage which were truly great and up to our expectations. All the ladies working there were fab, friendly and professional. The massage therapist Khadija has magical fingers. We had little escape in the spa. Overall, rooms,restaurants, spa are nothing but amazing and true value for money."
 February 2021,5,Everything was good,Great moment and great hotel.amazing service.laila at piscine and restaurants was probably the most friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay again.the breakfast was amazing also.good staff good food .everything amazing
 December 2020,5,Great hotel and Service,"We spent 3 beautiful days where we enjoyed the pool and its amenities, the service was great with all safety measures and we had some amazing food in the Italian restaurant where Jawad the manager took great care of us so thank you and your amazing staff for making us feel safe and home. We will be back very soon"
 January 2021,5,Massages by the best! : BOUCHRA :),"Massage with Bouchra is a must try ! Amazing hands, wish I could get her massages everyday ! 🤩 back massage, hammam gommage, definitely you should do them with her! Love her service, super relaxing and nice !!"
 December 2019,3,Move Move Move,"Move Move Move As the name implies, would ""move"" to another choice “pick.” The Sofitel (new wing) in Hivernage was quite nice on a prior visit Positives + has amenities + newer hotel Negatives - this was an industrial-strength hotel and was generally poorly serviced - generally there is a taxi-racket where they all try to set an irrational fixed-price for tourists; you can find the normally priced taxis (after haggling), but need to walk a few hundred feet up the block - not very close to the city center - broken bed slanting to the side - breakfast buffet had low food quality and was a zoo; no service even though hundreds of staff members running around - very strange layout - staff are unhappy but also appear fearful due to lack of employment opportunities in Marrakech"
 December 2020,5,"Excellent customer service, beautiful hotel","We stayed in December the hotel is what you would expect from a 5 star, lovely grounds, pool and rooms. The customer service is second to none especially receptionist hanane who helped us so much Thanks very much for a pleasant stay"
 December 2020,5,Great service,"I would like to leave this review for the amazing service i received from Hanane during the duration of my stay. She was polite, very efficient, made checking into my rooms painless and always had a smile on her face! Great service, great staff, awesome hotel."
 December 2020,1,Can’t sleep no A/C,"It’s 7:06 Am and I can’t sleep because the hotel reception is claiming that there is no A/C. He claims that the system is only used for heating. I can’t sleep and I hope that the hotel management checks call records or who is on duty today during this time because this doesn’t make sense at all. After several calls he said that he will send someone however, I have been waiting and they don’t answer the calls anymore. I am sitting outside because of the heat."
 November 2020,5,"Om Yoga Studio, a heartwearming experience","The Om Yoga Studio situated by the poolside at the hotel culminates an experience of diversity, dynamism, and mindfulness. Its courses are guided by wonderful, lurid teachers who provide an encouraging and fun platform for people to step forward and simply release. Kamil and Mourad are a sincere delight to be accompanied by in their whimsical ways of guiding their respected courses ! Great people, and great catalog of activity choices - The Bungee course in particular, led by Mourad, offers a different experience compared to the yoga courses - a fun approach to fitness that leaves you looking forward to the next session. The inner child finds its home at Om Yoga Studio, thank you for the wonderful time."
 November 2020,5,Beautiful experience,"I was delighted by the hotel and the quality of the yoga studio inside, especially the bungee course with Mourad ,he’s so nice with everybody and always helpful ,I will definitely go in his course and recommend it !"
 November 2019,1,Being beautiful is not enough,"There is no doubt this hotel is beautiful but for the amount of money I paid, it was sub-par. First, do not book any excursions through this hotel. I booked an excursion through them and paid more than booking through the tour company. They scam you into booking tours and excursions with them and take a huge cut. Honestly, don't use the hotel. Second, the staff is lazy and rude! The bell boys stand around watching people and talking. When we asked for directions to the square, the guy was so vague and nonchalant. He told us it was a 10 minute walk... It is not! The man at the Chocolate Hour asked me if I was staying at the hotel while I was helping myself. Excuse me? The worst was when the AC didn't work at night. My mom couldn't breathe and it was like a sauna! We called…"
 February 2020,5,Gorgeous hotel Amazing staff,This hotel has one of the nicest group of staff in the entire world. It is a large hotel consisting of about 7 buildings. I was on a Gate 1 tour and decided to forego the optional tours that evening. Was so happy I did because I was able to use the spa and hot tub free of charge and had an amazing dinner at the poolside restaurant. I remember this hotel because it smelled of roses and then we saw these massive vases of red roses.
 March 2020,5,Superb hotel with all the amenities,We were here with a Gate One tour group. The hotel was much more comfortable and accommodating than the Kenzi Tower Hotel in Casablanca. The lobby was incredibly well decorated and spacious with usually a local musician or mint tea stand somewhere. Breakfast was excellent. We loved the outdoor tapas bar where about 15 of us congregated one evening. Rooms were spacious and hads everything you could possibly need. The staff of course was super cordial and helful.
 March 2020,5,O'De Rose Spa,One of the best spa treatments I've had in a while. The staff was supper attentive and the price was great. I recommend you ask for Asma she was very experienced and gave me a great massage. I look forward to another one before my trip ends
 March 2020,5,Best hotel in marrakech,"We spent me and my wife an unforgettable night at the Hotel Movenpick Marrakech for the first time to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was overall the best hotel experience we ever had so far. i really recommend this hotel. The design is very unique. Rooms are very comfortable with all the facilities. Swimming pool & Fitness center are exceptional food is amazing and the staf are very nice and attentive. We were greeted by a young and adorable young lady named Hind at the Reception, she made us a quick check in and the gentleman who served us tea with Moroccan pastry was also friendly. We were surprised by a beautiful decoration from the entrance of the bedroom and bathroom, I thank all the ladies very much: Nezha and Leila from the Reception, Mchmachi, salma and…"
 March 2020,5,2nd time here,"We came same time last year we liked so much we came back again . Peaceful,safe,clean and not rowdy and not too far from the main medina only a short taxi ride away. Staff here are exceptional always smiling. It was nice that some of the staff remembered us from last year but there was one member of staff that stood head and shoulders above everyone else and that was Laila what an asset she is to this hotel. We had a slight issue with one of the rooms and she had it resolved instantly. We really love marrakech and we'll be back next year and we'll only be staying here . Thankyou Laila and the rest of the staff . Au revoir"
 March 2020,5,Very Relaxing,"Asma was amazing. Very comforting, very accommodating. Best 1-hour massage in Marrakech. I will definitely be coming back and will do more than just the one hour relaxing massage. Asma was very professional."
 March 2020,4,One week friends/couples stay,"We were warmly greeted to the hotel by Nezlah and Abdullah who kindly assisted us with finding a room according to our preferences. The hotel is very grand and beautiful with all the facilities that one requires. Breakfast was delicious with very friendly chefs. However, it would have been nice with a larger selection of fresh fruits instead of canned. We enjoyed the interaction with the bar manager Mohammed who provided us with some nice local recommendations. Our most memorable meal in the hotel was at the Urban Brassiere where we were looked after by Mahmoud who was truly fantastic. He was friendly, professional and understood our needs. Moreover, the food was delicious. We did struggle a bit with the speed of the service when it came to requests to be delivered to our…"
 March 2020,5,Friendly,"I had arranged pick-up from airport with travel agent, arrived at hotel easily but had to wait for check in some time, because guests in front of me with special requests took all their (and my) time. But concierge with luggage was extremely friendly and helpful. The resort style hotel has very nice appearance, some swimming pools, restaurants, bar,... and also with several wall paintings, partly in Banksy-style. Quite nice here... The longer I stood the less guests were here - due to Corona tourism is suffering from cancellations... My room was very quiet and nice. I left my golf bag at concierge for daily picking it up and restoring later (Golfing was my main reason to come to Marrakesh). At end I asked for a late check-out, which was no problem, Mohamed from reception helped…"
 March 2020,5,Brasserie bar,"I had graet time in movenpick hotel espically at manso bar. All bar team are friendly, starting up with Jihan and end up with dj Without forgetting Saad (the bar manager) .also i want to thank Marcelona team (the restorant) for their hospitality ."
 March 2020,5,A magical holiday,"I absolutely loved everything about the Movenpick hotel! I was travelling solo so was a little worried that I would be bored at times, however, the Movenpick hotel staff are excellent - extremely polite, always smiling, attentive and made my stay a magical experience! I would especially like to thank the Jamra restaurant manager Youssef who made sure that I was having a wonderful time at the quiet pool! The restaurant serves delicious healthy food which is brought to you whilst you’re relaxing in the sun. Thank you for taking such great care of me! The hotel rooms are spacious and cleaned every day by very friendly ladies. Even on Women’s day they have thought to put a little rose in the bedroom. The breakfast was delicious offering freshly made Moroccan pancakes, omelettes,…"
 March 2020,5,Manso bar,"It's like the first time that i visit this hotel and it was so nice place the view the buffet was good all the waitresses ,in the bar are helpful and i would like to thank sara and jihane for the amazing welcome and also her manger saad for this wonderful time that i had"
 March 2020,3,Golf week,"Hotel location is great, but my experience with staff at reception rather poor. Same with staff at morning coffee. Pool restaurant should have better card, some more cold dishes, not only pizza. Missed a restaurant with local dishes."
 March 2020,5,The perfect spot to do it all in Marrakech,"I came to the Movenpick Marrakech with a friend for a relaxing break and some winter sun along with a chance to get out into the city to enjoy a bit of the local culture. The location is perfect as it's within a short taxi ride of all the main sights and restaurants but still feels secluded enough from the hustle and bustle of the Medina and busier tourist spots. The rooms are fantastic and a generous size and there are a number of pools with many sunbeds should you wish to spend a day relaxing in the sun. The real star of the hotel is it's staff, however. Everyone is polite, courteous and more than willing to do whatever it takes to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We would particularly like to thank Leila and Hanane who went over and above on several occasions to…"
 March 2020,5,Movenpick hotel /hospitality,"This is our second stay at the Movenpick (Marrakesh). It is a fantastic hotel, the staff are amazing (this was one of the reasons why we came back to the movenpick) kind, friendly, polite and extremely courteous. I had a few queries and Laila who's based at the reception dealt with them straight away, she was so professional and respectful. The whole ambience of the hotel is outstanding and the breakfast is amazing. For me the location is ideal (slightly away from the hustle and bustle). We will definitely be returning back to the Movenpick. Thank you to all the staff especially Laila."
 March 2020,5,Great stay!,"Great hotel full of great staff (in particularly Laila from reception), who made our stay even better. Fantastic hotel with brilliant views and food. Will be coming back to Marrakech next year to stay here again"
 March 2020,5,Movernpick Hotel,"This has been by far my best stay. Upon arriving to Movernpick hotel we were greeted and approached by the bell boy Mad Aimed. He quickly and politely helped us with our 5 heavy suitcases which were in the room waiting for us after we checked in. A few hours after check in there was a minor sanitation issue with our room. Once we made the receptionist Nehzar aware she quickly accommodated us. She was understanding, respectful and kind to us. She reported the issue to the manager Hadid and he upgraded our normal room into a deluxe suite. Nehzar also gave us two free spa vouchers. Their care and problem solving was greatly appreciated. At the spa we were massaged by Naija and Imane. They are real professionals. I was comfortable, relaxed and soothed thanks to them. They were…"
 March 2020,5,Amazing Hospitality!,"After an unfortunate start with the initial room we had been given, the hospitality we received from the movenpick, in particular Laila from the reception, to reprimand the situation was unbelievable. It is my second visit here and I will undoubtedly return for a third."
 February 2020,5,Excellent hotel,"Huge hotel with large, beautiful grounds and very nice pool area. Several dining options. Lovely large room. Great breakfast buffet. Good location down the street from a major mall and not too far from the old medina. This was our second 5* hotel stay in this area of Marrakesh, and the Movenpick was definitely superior."
 March 2020,5,Fatima Zahra was excellent,"The breakfast here is fantastic, so many different options and great customer service. A big thank you to Fatima for her beautiful smile, pleasant manner, excellent customer service and of course the fabulous mint tea."
 February 2020,5,Excellent stay in Marrakech,If you want to choose a hotel for your stay you can trust this hotel where you can experience a real five star hotel with a real five star Moroccan service. I move to this hotel after a bad experience with another hotel in Marrakech. A fancy lobby filled with the smell of flowers is ready to welcome you. Check in was so fast and easy. Breakfast was so tasty and covers all tastes. Room was so big and comfortable and was well designed.
 December 2019,4,Hotel is quite new and well facilitated,"The Movenpick Hotel is located some 30 minutes walking distance from Jama El f’na Market & Souks to its west, or 10 minutes' walk to the very modern Menara Mall to its south. The area feels quite safe, even as we hiked back to hotel at night. The hotel itself is quite okay, with all the facilities you would expect from a 4 star hotel. The breakfast is well stocked with varieties and choices. The staff members are generally friendly."
 February 2020,5,Huge hotel attached to convention center--great!,"Great hotel, beautiful corridors and rooms, lovely large outdoor pool. Breakfasts were terrific. Comfortable beds, nice bathroom and hot shower with lots of water, and the room was large. Service was good but not excellent--service sort of on Morocco time...."
 February 2020,5,Great hotel,"Great hotel, Rooms are nice and comfortable... breakfast is excellent. The food at the restaurant was excellent too. The staff are very nice and professional. Great pool facilities and friendly staff. Special thanks to Jihane, Othman and Anas. We will certainly stay again at the Movenpick during our next visit to Marrakech."
 February 2020,5,Youssef’s customer service skills was amazing,"He was very attentive and catered to all our needs, he’s very easy to communicate with and helped with everything we needed and more! Thanks, this makes our stay at the Mövenpick so much easier and helps us start our day amazingly! Also the breakfast is exceptional."
 November 2019,4,A very good hotel in a quiet residential area.,"The hotel is located in a residential area, 10min walk from Marrakesh railway station and ca 30min walk (10min in a taxi) from the old town. The hotel has 2 outdoor pools - one heated, and plenty of sunbeds available around the pools - at least in November, when the mornings were too cold to lie by the pool, we did not have an issue finding sunbeds around midday. We had breakfast included and there is plenty to choose from including fresh fruit, various cooking stations, etc. Our room was quite spacious, with decent size bathroom, clean and with all the expected amenities. The staff is friendly and helpful, just watch out for the taxi drivers outside - their asking prices are always 2-3 times or more what it should be, so negotiate before getting in!!"
 February 2020,4,A place to rediscover yourself,"Perfect balance between work and leisure if you are on business trip. Perfectly relaxing if you want to forget business and only think leisure. If you really want to discover Marrakech, do it from Mövenpick Hotel."
 February 2020,5,Perfect hotel,I advise you to chose this hotel if you ever wanna spend a good moment in marrakech. Everything was perfect Clean and organized If you go there ask for nezha in the reception she is a golden woman Thank you again
 February 2020,5,Excellent Staff,"Movenpick is an excellent hotel in every way possible. The staff is the key to make your stay at the hotel enjoyable as it should be namely Nezha, who went above and beyond the call of duty. Nezha is patient, professional and accommodating. Praise her, she’s a wonderful asset to the Movenpick chain."
 February 2020,5,The best place to be for kids;),"I am simply in love with this hotel!! I particularly appreciate the kids club, so spacious and colorful ! My kids can spend all the day playing, dancing and painting. They can also enjoy a delicious meal specially cooked for them:) Special thanks to kids club team, you’re doing a great job guys😘"
 February 2020,5,A great place to stay,"I have decided to celebrate my birthday in Marrakech and Mövenpick hotel was an obvious choice. We had a warming welcome by Hanane who accompanied us all along our stay at the hotel. Hanane was professional, friendly and very much client oriented. The room was great and the breakfast delicious. We highly recommend Mövenpick."
 February 2020,5,My favorite place in Marrakech,"A great experience above our expectations. The hotel has all the right installations to keep you inside. The team very warm and you feel all the time very welcome. Jamra Restaurant next to the pool offer a healthy menu w/o gluten and lactose next to the pool to allow you enjoy from the sun. Urban brasserie is the great choice for dinner or even the buffet menu at the pool terrace. The SPA open long hours with free access to Jacuzzi, Hammam and Sauna, reserve the hammam and massage on time! Thank you to FADOU, Dauaa, Jamila, Kamir, Mr. Bennani, Chef Ahmed & Chef Tariq. We look forward to come back soon."
 February 2020,5,O de Rose Spa,The spa at Movenpick Marrakech was a really good experience. I got the hands and feet treatment done by Najia at the Spa in Movenpick Marrakech. She took her time and did not rush. I would recommend asking for Najia as she will do it with care and pleasure. The 1 hour treatment was worth the money. I could tell the difference before and after the treatment and the service by Najia and the Spa overall was excellent.
 February 2020,5,Spa,"I had a spa package while on a business trip. The hotel was great and the overall service was wonderful. The spa package included a hammam, a massage and beauty feet. It was my first experience with hammam and I was a little nervous but my skin never felt so exfoliated and refreshed. I’m very picky about massage and am always worried when there’s a language barrier. The massage with Najia was probably one of the best I’ve had, just the right pressure, very intuitive and very patient with the communication. The following foot treatment was also wonderful. The overall spa experience at movenpick and with Najia was exceptional."
 February 2020,5,Fantastic & super friendly!,"Compliments to the staff of the Mövenpick Marrakech! Beautiful entourage, super cool graffiti art, Öm Yoga studio, fitness, Spa, 3 pools, bars & restaurants! Great possibilities for all kind of travellers! Special shout-out 😁🤩 to the following people: Saïd & Mohammed at the reception. Hassan at the pool bar. Kaltoum at the Spa. Skiriba at housekeeping. And the rest of the team! They all made our holiday a big succes! Shukraan lak! Thank you very much! Already looking forward to come back to beautiful Marrakeck!"
 February 2020,5,Family,"Staff are excellent especially in Saray. Breakfast staff Mohammed and all waiters, the ladies making msemen and sfinga bread are super and deserve my special appreciation. Special thanks to Mustapha and Fatima Alzahra. Great hospitality"
 January 2020,4,Pretty much as advertised,"Our tour started with 3 nights in this hotel. Considering how tired I was after first a long flight and second after a day of touring, the only things that I was really interested in was sleep and recharging batteries for my electronics. As far as sleep goes, the hotel was very good - I fell asleep quickly and slept soundly. Recharging however was another story. Like many of the hotels outside the US the room's electricity was disconnected when you took your key-card to leave the room and as a result all recharging stopped. I solved this problem by asking for a second card, which more or less worked except when the maid removed the card while I was out during the day. Since it was part of my tour, I have no idea of how much we paid, so I can't assess its value."
 February 2020,5,Marrakech with kids,"We have been staying in Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech for 5 days in February. Couldn't have been happier with the hotel that we choose. We had a wonderful experience. The rooms are spacious, the heated pool makes our stay even more pleasant. I want to write a huge thank you to the ladies who run the kids club. With 2 small children it was a perfect choice, since the kids have been entertained, busy with different types of games, and fed for most of the time of the day, and we had some spare time."
 February 2020,5,Brilliant hotel wonderful staff & hospitality,"The hotel is fantastic very good service and clean rooms. A lot of facilities to use also. The staff are great especially one named Moshin! He really took care of me during my stay, helped set up activities for me and even sorted out the refund for me when it got cancelled honestly made my trip very smooth. I’d definitely recommend here and can’t wait to return."
 February 2020,5,Incredible customer service especially from Hanane,Customer service here is exceptional but Hanane made our stay much more pleasant. She help us book our tours and assisted with anything else we needed. She is the best always helping out with a smile. Will definitely recommend the hotel and have them go directly to her.
 February 2020,5,Staff,"Honestly apart from the room, facilities, and overall experience the staff at this hotel is exceptional. Laila from reception is a dream to work with, as she made sure our stay was pleasurable and memorable. Her knowledge about the city and recommendations were always valued and sought for. It honestly makes me so happy to experience such a service as it can make a huge difference."
 February 2020,5,"Superb first experience in Marrakech, was amazed by the hospitality and was way beyond any of my expectation!!!! :)","Went on holiday for my mums birthday, was very hesitant at first as of what hotels in Marrakech would be accommodating to what she wanted. Extremely satisfied to say the least, staff offered excellent service (V.friendly, gave us excellent recommendations) Thank you Layla :) Hope to see you soon"
 February 2020,5,Reception Staff,"5*service from Poolside team,Monsef,Jihane,Tarik,Mohammed and Bar Tender Hassan. They made us feel very welcome. However the reception staff Laila and Safa were rude,lacked basic customer service skills and treated us with no courtesy.This is not what I expected from Movenpick as I have heard lots of fantastic things about this hotel,and also had recommended friends and family to visit,I have even thought about booking another visit there.Due to my experience I am not sure I will visit again."
 February 2020,5,"Incredible customer service, especially Layla","Extremely happy with the service provided to us by Layla she went above and beyond for us, she was extremely helpful and sorted any problems with the accommodation. Layla was very patient with us which you don’t get from many other hotels. If you want to witness excellent customer service then Layla is definitely the standard to which it should be. I want to thank Layla once again for her support and her professionalism to make sure that we will have a pleasant stay. Incredible service."
 February 2020,5,Excellent first experience in Marrakech with Mövenpick,"We were there on a company business trip, and have to admit that it was an excellent choice of Hotel. The outdoor pool is amazing, they have clean and very nice rooms, also one of the most comfortable bed ever! The staff is amazing! I had an experience with one particular staff member, called Hanane, that made the best suggestions for the free time activity. She was very professional and kind, making our stay easier and comfortable. Definitely worth a visit! Enjoy!"
 February 2020,5,SPA O De Rose,"After a few days of intensive visit of beautiful Marrakesh I treat myself with a well deserved pedicure ‘griffe’ by the beautiful Ghizlane in the O de Rose spa center. The staff is very welcoming, friendly and customer oriented. Many thanks. I now have “happy feet” again and ready to enjoy the evening. Christina from Luxembourg"
 February 2020,5,Excellent,I decided to go this place.i look on mobile this hotel. This is very good place. I am very interested in this. Very nice and beautiful place all services are available. Excellent customer service and best services provided by hotel.
 February 2020,5,Very impressive!,"I've decided to visit Marrakech for the first time to celebrate my birthday and couldn't have chosen a better hotel for the special occasion. From the moment we checked in, everyone was very attentive, kind and accommodating. My husband had recently injured his coccyx and they managed to get us a room with a bathtub for his recovery. They also spontaneously gave me a cake to celebrate my birthday, which was really yummy and covered with macaroons, which I love!! The hotel's facilities are also impressive and you can tell that each area is well maintained. They have 3-4 pools, including one calmer and more private, perfect for people with kids. Overall, my experience was very positive and I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone. A special thank you to Safa and Leila for…"
 January 2020,5,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel will take you into a fairy tale world of Moroccan interior combined with class and tradition! Well-trained personnel,great breakfast, warmed up outdoor pool and a beautiful room is awaiting for u. Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return."
 February 2020,3,Nice experience if you can even get in,"Me, my boyfriend and his mother (on holiday in Marrakesh) tried to access this hotel on a day pass to use the pool and restaurant area. When we arrived we were told by reception when we enquired there was NO ROOM and we would not be able to get in the pool because it would be so full. One member of staff rudely dismissed us and directed us to someone else. We then just booked the pass online, which we would have done before but we thought it would have been better to book face to face at the hotel and make sure everything was in order with the deal. Once presented with our booking She then eventually admired us entry but said we would not be able to get in the pool. Once inside, the pool area and loungers were basically empty, expect for a few families and couples sun…"
 February 2020,5,Beautiful resort with Brilliant staff,"We are a very lucky family ,we have stayed at some beautiful hotels. But the Movenpick in Marrakech is simply one of the best. The hotel is stunning, there's incredible art work in the reception area and you are greeted with beautiful sofas in stunning colours and it's obvious that this is a classy hotel. Our room was beautiful , it was incredibly clean and very modern and we had a lovely terrace which overlooked the well kept gardens. In the afternoon , I would sit on the terrace and I would spend hours, enjoying the absolute peace. The bathroom was great and had the most fantastic shower. The WiFi was excellent, there was a very strong signal. Breakfast was a wonderful treat. There were so many staff who would constantly make sure you had everything that you needed. The food…"
 December 2019,4,Very enjoyable and comfortable stay,"Upon our arrival the reception was full of guests waiting to check-in and most appeared to be tired and somewhat frustrated. Our check-in process was overly long and it appeared the front desk staff were overwhelmed. The chap who checked us iin was a bit of a smart alec who was speaking down to us until he was taken down a peg by me. I am annoyed that I failed to note down his name. We also didn't feel the usual Moroccan warm welcome, there was no mint tea (or any beverage) offered upon arrival. In addition, of the 4 rooms booked only 3 were ready and it took 2 hours for the fourth room to be ready. We eventually had to make a fuss and were given a complimentary dinner at the hotel's top restaurant, the Urban Brasserie, for later that evening. The hotel's interiors are…"
 February 2020,5,Amazing stay,"Professional staff and pay attention to details they are welcoming and warm, thank you abdellah and all the team, très jolie hôtel avec une piscine amazing décoration as well, très bien placé, près de palais congrès"
 February 2020,5,Hammam ô de rose spa,"I really enjoyed my hammam in ô de rose spa in movenpick hôtel, fatimazahra chouabi was wonderful at exfoliating my body and washing my hair so gently, she was amazing. I definitely recommend it and recommend her for anyone wanting to relax and enjoy the moroccan hammam but with a luxurious touch."
 January 2020,4,"Great service, nice resort but with tiring amenities","We stayed a week in January 2020 here as a family of four. The service at the hotel was near perfect. From the pool staff, through to the restaurant staff, and especially our room cleaner - Mina - they were excellent. For example, the kids loved to come into our room and find how their toys had been set-up that day by her. All were very attentive and kind. In terms of the rooms and amenities the resort is looking a bit tired. From mosaics coming away from the main pool floor to a number of faulty lifts it is in need of a little tlc. Equally we got adjoining rooms but they were connected by an antechamber that then had a separate door onto the hotel corridor which made us feel a little vulnerable with the two young kids in the next room. Our room had a balcony overlooking…"
 December 2019,5,Taha - Service,"Taha was a fantastic host, he was extremely kind with a great personality and provided excellent service at breakfast everyday. He was very welcoming which really made my family and I feel at home. The hotel was beautiful and modern but still maintained the Moroccan ambience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Marrakech."
 January 2020,5,Lovely resort with great staff,"Our company stayed here for our global sales meeting, buying out the property. It is a beautiful resort with multiple buildings for rooms, the spa, yoga, the gym, restaurants, etc. and it’s connected to a convention center, where we had our meetings and event nights. There are also a couple of swimming pools. The food was pretty good considering they had to feed about 550 people 3 meals a day plus coffee breaks. Mostly it was buffet, so it did get repetitive after a couple of days, but breakfast was always awesome and a few of the dinners were quite good. My room was quiet, clean and spacious. It had a mini fridge and water bottles were replenished with maid service. Huge bathroom with a large shower (no bathtub), robe, slippers, good towels, etc. Just no wash cloths, for some…"
 January 2020,5,Excellent hotel with great atmosphere,"The staff was very friendly and took care of us. At the front desk, Mohssine helped us booking great and interesting tours. Lovely ambience with jasmine-scented lobby with Morrocan music and mint tea. Great amenities."
 January 2020,5,Beautiful decor and grounds,"It was a great pleasure to take photographs in this gleaming hotel, with its modern Moroccan colors and motifs, fountains and small streams flowing beneath suspended huge golden filigreed lanterns, and beautifully landscaped and lit pool area. Breakfast was very complete and the bar was a fun place to chat with fellow tour members. It is located within walking distance of the square and the souks and is also near the mall."
 December 2019,5,A message for the hotel and Mrs Nadia guest service,Since my arrival Nadia was the best guest service I've ever met and she has to work hard to make me feel happy also she offered me a lot of help and she was so nice to me ... as a woman I was afraid but she helped me so much ... About the hotel I liked so much it make us feel comfy tbh I hope to see more guest services like Nadia / thank you so much Nadia Iwish you all the best I hope you receive this message
 January 2020,5,Excellente,"It was marvellous, the hotel was beautiful and the staff were so nice and welcoming. The breakfast was amazing with so much to choose from and we want to thank most of all Mohamed Skiriba who was so nice and helpful and made our stay so memorable, my dad was very happy with his café crème every morning👍 A big thanks to our favourite Mohamed from your Irish guests Mary, Alex & Sandy💋😘"
 August 2019,3,A beautiful hotel with a few shortcomings!,"On arrival the reception was totally packed with tired, frustrated visitors and only two staff members were on duty. We were given absolutely no tourist material or a map of Marrakesh. I had to ask for one the next day. We were upgraded to a very nice large room because our bedroom backed onto the neighbouring hotel's disco - we could not hear the TV in our room because the music was so loud. There were not enough sun loungers at the pool. And somehow they were reserved every morning with hotel towels until the ""special"" guests arrived. Otherwise all was ok.........."
 January 2020,5,Fantastisch hotel,"From January 7 till January 11 my daughter and I were guests in this wonderful hotel. The staff was unbelievably nice!! All of them were really friendly and helpful. I’ve travelled all around the world but this is really hard to find! Thank you for the great 4 days! If you are looking for a luxurious hotel with good prices, in the middle of Marrakech with a wonderful staff don’t look any further! This is your hotel. Even my Maroccan friends told me so!!"
 January 2020,4,5 Stars for the massage,Asma was my masseuse.. she was absolutely excellent.. her technique was perfect and her pressure was right on point. If I wasn’t leaving I would book her again. The room was comfortable and warm. The reception area was clean and the clerks were very hospitable.. and the tray served after was great!!
 November 2019,4,Solo time,"Lovely hotel with good facilities and good location.staff at hotel were very warm and helpful full. Nassima was very pleasant and allways smiling to all guests.In the busy morning breakfast restaurant. The heated pool was not warm at all,but overall all the hotel was very good.and would recommend."
 January 2020,3,Too large to feel authentic?,"We stayed in a variety of accommodations in Morocco and this place was the least welcoming. This might have to do with its size however as far as large hotels go, we also stayed in an all-inclusive and in another luxury hotel and these two were VERY welcoming. You know, have a seat with the mint tea upon arrival. I chose this hotel as I thought the photos made it look rather exotic. Quite the opposite. Again, just too big. Lastly, though the staff was very accommodating in keeping our two rooms within close vicinity of each other, we ended up in a wheelchair accessible room and it was not very comfortable: ie. stationary shower chair is right underneath shower head, difficult to shower. Fabric desk chair was in bad shape - quite filthy. For the price, everything should…"
 December 2019,4,"MRS. Nadia, Guest Services","Nadia, is the best guest service staff I have ever met since from my arrival and she has worked so hard to make us happy. very helpful and offered me the best services with hospotailty ,welcoming. She can handle pressure so well and I really appeciate. In future I am sure the hotel would recieve more guests with the extreamily well behaved services of Nadia. Apprecaite her knowledge and know how skill in guest handlinging. I wish Nadia a better future. Hussa Alqubaisi"
 January 2020,5,Excellent yoga and Spa facilities,"A very large hotel , well appointed and comfortable, set in lovely gardens with two outdoor swimming pools (one always heated to 26degrees). It is a brilliant place for a yoga week as the Om Yoga centre there is fabulous and has classes running through the day. Excellent breakfast and only about 10 minute taxi ride to the Médina. Polite, attentive, staff . Excellent Spa ( ask for Fatima to have a traditional Hammam ... she was great) . I plan to go again with my daughter for a mother-daughter yoga weekend and a relax by the pool. Lovely and good value ."
 December 2019,1,Staff attitude and service horrible,"I and my husband joined Insight Vacations for Morocco tour. We arrived in Marakech on Dec 25, 2019 and stayed there for 2 nights. Our Tour Director handed us the room key and confirmed that our room was twin bed as we strongly requested upon booking the tour. We were shocked the room given to us was not twin, instead it was double bed. The staff then re-arranged twin bed for us. However when we opened the door, someone was still occupying the room with her stuff all over the bed, so we quickly closed the door and informed the staff. They did not seem to show any concern or apologetic at all. Thereafter, the staff again re-arranged another twin bed for us which was away from the group. On the same night at around midnight, after washing my hair only then I realised the hair…"
 December 2019,5,Excellent hotel and excellent service!,"We travel almost every month to Marrakesh. I stay for the first time at the Movenpick together with my husband from December 8th till 12, 2019 at Movenpick Hotel in Marrakesh and we have been very satisfied and surprised about the quality of the hotel and the excellent service by all the Staff. Mr Mohssine from the reception and his colleagues where very professional and very helpful. Since my husband is an Accor Platinum (now Diamond) member, the ""Reception Staff"" ( Mr Mohssine and also two very kind and helpful ladies) treated us accordingly including the room upgrade. Check-in and check-out were quick. Since 2013 we stay always in another 5 star Accor hotel at Hivernage in Marrakesh. We both had a wonderful time at the Movenpick despite our short stay because we were…"
 January 2020,5,Wonderful Hotel in a beautiful city with amazing staff!,"The Movenpick hotel is an amazing place to stay while visiting Marrakech! It really is a vacation in itself, due to the kindness of staff. The rooms and grounds are immaculate. I actually extended my stay at this hotel because it is so good. Today, I walked into my room and the staff had placed roses and rose petals. Thank you to Baali Hanone,Ait ouarker Najaf madamme hilali for the beautiful presentation of roses. Also, the breakfast staff for providing a wonderful start to each day. Thank you also to Mr. Khalid Mawloud, manager, who took time to make me feel welcomed in this beautiful country."
 January 2020,5,The Spa and Hammam are a Must Visit.,"I had a Hamam - The spa centre is fresh, clean, hygienic and tranquil. The therapist who did the Hamam is called Kalthoum - she was absolutely brilliant. She was very professional, polite, courteous and she made the utmost effort to ensure you are comfortable and to maintain and to maintain as much privacy as possible. I highly recommend Movenpick and Kalthoum."
 December 2019,4,Week-long family vacation,"Lovely week-long trip to Marrakech with our family! Lots of positives, including an excellent kids club with great, motivated and attentive staff. Taha & Abdulkarim at breakfast were fantastic - they took great care of our large group. Thank you!! Amina (housekeeping) was lovely too. Thanks to all who made our stay comfortable :)"
 December 2019,5,Fantastic hotel!,"I normally stay at the Sofitel when I travel to Marrakech, but due to the hotel being fully booked for part of my stay I decided to try Movenpick for the dates I couldn't stay at the Sofitel. Well It ended up being such a blessing! As Movenpick is now a new favourite place that I will stay when visiting Marrakech! I had a wonderful time! Everyone was so lovely, especially beautiful Nezha at reservations she was extremely professional, helpful and very sweet and she would always greet me with a big smile! I would also like to thank a few other special people like Taha my waiter, he's truly an amazing guy, he seemed to genuinely love his job! Also Kamal the chef, ibtissam and Mahdi they both did the most amazing omelettes for me!! The lovely cleaners Noura and Fatima and finally…"
 December 2019,5,Excellent hotel with excellent service,I stayed with my wife begin December 2019 at Movenpick Hotel in Marrakech and was very satisfied about the quality of the hotel and the excellent service. Mr Mohamed (Reception) and colleagues where very professional and helpful. Has an Accor platinum member the Reception Staff treated me accordingly including the room upgrade. Check-in and check-out were quick. The food at the restaurant was excellent and also the staff. Breakfast could in some way a little bit better regarding the choice. The room was very clean. The wifi in the room was not so good especially because I need very good Wi-Fi for my work. LAN was not available. The IT manager have done what was possible to help me and reception told me that next time the Wi-Fi will be ok. I’m travelling almost every month…
 January 2020,2,Disappointing,"The experience was not 5 star, we paid extra for a room garden view result of it we were next to a big outdoor condenser that we could hear while trying to sleep.. Service is so so... i would not recommend as you will have for a lower price much better alternative arounds..."
 December 2019,5,Wonderful Christmas Destination,"Spacious rooms well appointed ,beautiful pool with comfortable sun-loungers ,breakfast with healthy freshly squeezed orange juice and delicious omelettes But the most note-worthy factor to mention must be the helpful friendly staff . On arrival after a long day travelling unfortunately our booking couldn't be traced despite being prepaid ,but NEZHA managed to sort the matter out and throughout the remainder of our stay was so helpful in supplying valuable local advice ,always charming with a beautiful smile Thank you Nezha -you made our family visit very special and we look forward to another Xmas in Marrakech"
 December 2019,5,Massage,"My wife and mother in law stayed here for one night and thoroughly enjoyed our time at Movenpick. Amazing massage from Najia, worry every penny paid! Beautiful spa and jacuzzi with very attentive staff."
 December 2019,5,Recent Stay,Taha and AbdulKarim were fantastic servers. They went above and beyond. Would highly recommend staying here. Very safe and clean and friendly staff. December would be best time to visit you! Don’t miss out
 December 2019,5,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at Movenpick Hotel for 4 nights over Christmas and came away very happy with most aspects of the experience. We arrived a couple of hours ahead of the check-in time of 3pm but our room was ready for us and the check-in process was handled quickly and efficiently. The hotel is situated in the new part of the city and some distance from the Medina and main tourist sights so you do need to think about using taxi's or tour company's to get around as its a long walk otherwise and there is not much to see nearby. Our room was one of the classic rooms but it was spacious, clean and well-equipped and the only negative aspect was that our room in block 2 was overlooking a service area with the aircon units and this was periodically very noisy if you had the balcony door…"
 December 2019,5,Excellent place to stay in Marrakech!,"One quick story first to tell the sort of place this is: We were a group of 6. We booked 5 nights + half board. Upon our arrival, we found out that our half board plan entitled us to one restaurant only (the brasserie) and that this restaurant was serving Italian food mainly. We like Italian cuisine, but hadn't come to Morocco to have anything but Moroccan cuisine. We complained about this to the reception whilst we were checking in. We saw the Head of Reception Leila taking our disappointment in earnest and doing her best to address our problem. Minutes after this, we received confirmation that the Chef, Tarek, would cook special menus for us. And so he did! We had 5 fantastic dinners cooked specially for us by Tarek and his team. One of the best couscous I ever had, a great…"
 December 2019,5,Good breakfast service,"Mohamed Skiriba was very attentive during our daily breakfast at your lovely hotel. He came round to ask if we needed anything else, tea, coffee etc and was very polite. Breakfast variety was also very good in addition to the top customer service from Mohamed"
 December 2019,5,Wonderful stay at this five star beautiful hotel!,"The hotel is beautiful and underwent a major renovation and it shows. Very chic but comfortable. The staff is incredibly attentive and want to do everything to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. I was collected from the airport by the hotel transport that is outstanding. It went flawlessly as it was my first time visiting Marrakech and didn't feel comfortable taking a taxi right away. The cost was affordable for such service. We drove up to the property and I instantly knew this was going to be an experience. Once checked in I was greeted by Asma, who invited to show me around the hotel at my convenience. I'm glad I took her offer and got to learn a lot about the brand and the hotel. To my surprise I was upgraded to a suite, which was truly magnificent for my ten day…"
 December 2019,5,Great service and breakfast!,"The hotel breakfast is located in a spacious restaurant with nice decor and has quite a few selections including local pastries which I recommend. They also have outstanding service. Our waiters Mohamed Skiriba, Yousafe and Amine Ouzit were very helpful to serve our big family. Thank you!"
 December 2019,5,Fabulous,"Wonderful experience. Staff are helpful and friendly. Located in the new part of the city, it's just within walking distance of the Koutubia mosque and Jemaa El Fnaa. The highlight though has to be it's design and amenities. It's spacious and has a lovely pool. Would certainly recommend it."
 December 2019,5,Quality Breakfast at Movenpick Mansour Eddahbi Hotel,"We stayed overnight at Movenpick Hotel, Marrakech and we truly enjoyed our time. The hotel courtyard is beautiful surrounded with hotel building that exudes Morroco's cultural architecture. The people here is also very friendly as we got acquinted with Mohmaed Skiriba and Amine Ouzit, who are serving us well for breakfast."
 December 2019,5,Mr Haq,"Excellent spa & hamam treatment/experience provided by Kaltoum. Beutiful Hotel and the service,breakfast buffet,restaurant is excellent. The food quality is very good. I loved my stay here and would recommend anyone coming to marrakech to stay at Movenpick."
 December 2019,5,Outstanding 5 star hotel ****,"We stayed here for 7 nights and no other words other than wow!! We were very satisfied with every aspect of the hotel. When we first checked in we had a very warm welcome, staff at reception desk were very friendly, especially Safae, she went extra lengths to make sure our needs were met, very knowledgeable and professional. Hotel room was beautiful, lovely black marble bathroom very clean. Nasima welcomed us everyday at the breakfast hall with a warm smile, always ready to help. Nasima is an absolute asset to the the hotel, she is extremely professional and really stands out, She is always on hand ready to help her guests in a very professional enthusiastic manner. I don’t have a bad word to say about this hotel, all the staff are always smiling and helpful and the hotel itself…"
 December 2019,5,Christmas holidays,"I can only recommend this place for those who are thinking about having some days of relax in Marrakech. This place is absolutely amazing and the customer service is outstanding (special mention to Mourad who kindly showed me everything around). I am pretty sure this place is one of the best in Marrakech in terms of quality-price. Rooms: I booked a classic room with a king size bed. Very clean and well equipped. Facilities: they have diverse pools, gym, spa area (they offer special treatments which are quite reasonable in terms of price), boutiques inside the hotel, different restaurants, yoga studio, etc etc. Customer service: As I mentioned above, it is outstanding. The staff is extremely helpful and kind."

 December 2019,5,Amazingly friendly staff,"Spent 4 days here, the rooms were sparkling clean and bed super comfortable. What deserves particular mention is the exceptional service during breakfast from Mohamed Skiriba who greeted us every morning and paid particular attention to each of our preferred hot drinks and had them ready for us at the table before we even sat down to eat. Great young man along with all the other staff at the hotel. Not a bad word can be said about our experience."
 December 2019,4,The Hotel is special.....,"with arts every where. Very big lobby without any guests. The garden is green all over and beautiful! There are few pools and a lot of benches, for many guests! The staff is very friendly and helpful! Breakfast is good the Coffee shop ok. The distance from the airport is 4 km. Only the room service needs a upgrade. Our refrigerator has wine but no corkscrew. We asked few times for one, at end we got one, but took us few calls ! They prefer to send some waiter to open the small bottle of wine. Second morning we wait until 3pm to clean our suite. Few calls and walk to the lobby helps finally ! Excuse was we have so many guests! But we are guest too! Our suite is costly for Marrakech. We are still at the Mövenpick and we want to enjoy our last night! We lived many years in…"
 December 2019,5,"Wonderful staff, beautiful facility and great location","I visited Marrakech for the first time with my family and I sincerely hope to be back soon and will definitely be staying at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and were keen to ensure we had a good stay. The hotel has a few pools, spa, yoga, restaurants, bars etc. On checking in, Hanane was very welcoming and set the scene for a lovely stay. She was caring and made sure our room was spacious enough for our family of 4. She was also there on checking out to say her goodbyes. The hotel has a lovely kid's club where we were able to leave the kids for hours while we had a relaxing holiday. The club is managed by Nehza who was absolutely caring and looked after the kids like they were hers. They were well fed and engaged in all sorts of activities (all free) The kids kept…"
 December 2019,5,Mohammed Amine - best service provider,"Beautiful hotel, would highly recommend it! Some days we preferred to stay in the hotel. Food is great, service is great and surroundings!

 October 2019,5,Hotel Movenpick Marrakech,"I stayed in October 2019 in this hotel. I would like to share my experience that I enjoyed from the moment I arrived. The hotel is outstanding located by Hivernage, where plenty of other hotels are.

 December 2019,5,Excellent 5 star experience!,"We really enjoyed Movenpick hotel for several reasons : the hotel ( bar, swimming pool , spa , ..) is just great. The room is big and comfortable! Breakfast is excellent : big thanks to the lady and gentleman who made us excellent eggs ! Also special mention for the relaxing massage of Imane at the Spa : Imane takes really good care of you !

 November 2019,4,Wonderful staff,"I stayed at the hotel for more than three weeks for business. The breakfast is a highlight, though I wouldn't recommend the restaurants for dinner. I found the staff extremely helpful and friendly. Special thanks to the team of ""service du soin"": Nezhatari Touri, Roqia Eloussoul, Sedki Khadija, Elhilali Khadija, Elmachmachi Amina, you made my home away from home!"
 December 2019,5,Great hotel,"This is a brilliant hotel with amazing service. The staff are all extremely helpful, in particular Yusuf who is part of the breakfast team has been amazing. After the first day he already knew what hot drink we wanted and brought them over without us even having to ask for it. Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Marrakech. Location is great too!"
 December 2019,5,Nothing to critisize-everything to praise,"We stayed 7 nights for a golf holiday. No matter where you stay you will always find something to critisize, but really I cannot think of anything at all we were unhappy about. It is a massive hotel arranged in blocks and as a result impersonal. After 7 days we did not really know any of the staff at all, but that was fine. Remi on reception was very helpful indeed, as was every single staff member we met. They could not have been more helpful, respectful and kind. The breakfast is superb, the best we have had anywhere, and the impressive boss of that service runs it like clockwork and clearly commands huge respect from his staff. The rooms, sheets, cleaning, pool etc etc were without fault. We relaxed poolside late afternoon and whilst it was crowded at times there was no…"
 December 2019,4,Excellent service,"I stayed at the hotel for 4 weeks. The best thing about the hotel is the staff. Ghizlane was particularly amazing, attentive, gentle, professional and thorough. She and the service staff keep the luxury standing of this hotel."
 October 2019,5,Nicely surprised !!!!,"I’ve been to several Movenpicks around the world but this one came on top, good servicing, great food and the rooms very clean. I knew that is was going to be a great experience in This hotel from the receptionist and all the efforts she did to make our waiting time a joy. Thank you Nezha for your time and dedication, your recommendations were very helpful during our stay in Marrakech. Hope to comeback soon"

They renovated the rooms which are very clean and well decorated. They have spacious bathroom with beautiful marble. the bed was also very comfortable.

 December 2019,5,Great stay,"I stayed in this hotel for one night, and it exceeded my expectations. The property is well maintained and I loved the classic décor. Room was spacious with a nice view on the garden and pool. The staff I interacted with was friendly and professional. I would especially like to thank Amine the Concierge for his helpful tips and for finding me a great tour guide. Lahcen from the Concierge Desk was also very friendly and attentive. I would stay again!"
 December 2019,5,Urban brasserie,I was there for a business and I have not much time to explore the city and its restaurants that's why I wanted to eat in the hotel I slept in. Simply Great experience with a splendid service especially at the Level of food. Haven't regret it thank you
 December 2019,5,Amazing spa!!,I had an amazing Hamam experience with Keltoum who scrubbed away all of the dead skin making me feel brand new. I then had an amazing back massage with Bouchra - so good I actually fell asleep. Thank you so much for making me have a restful holiday!!
 November 2019,5,Friend night with great food,We came late at the restaurant the Urban Brasserie and the manager took us in without rushing the food or service. We came back every single night during our stay as the drinks and the ambiance were too satisfaction. Thank you again for the all team and their management.
 December 2019,5,Urban Brasserie,We were staying in Movempick Marrakech and we had one of the best meals in the Urban Brasserie Restaurant.

We ate there every day during our stay and service and food was consistently great. Thank you for make our stay memorable and we will definitely come back. And of course we will miss the food!!
 December 2019,1,Not 5 star service,"If your looking for 5 star service then this is not the place. We stayed there for 6 nights and had multiple issues, during the night our shower went off by itself multiple times. I told the manager Amin who was very hard to get a hold of then finally when we did speak to him he was very dismissive of the issue and didn’t have any empathy of the fact that we both had a sleepless night and as a result told us we could change rooms with no upgrade offered, this was on day 5 so we asked him to send a technician to fix the problem which was fixed finally. He then offered us a drink at the bar, I was horrified by his response and refused that and said you should be offering us a lot more than a drink he then went onto say well you can have a meal. I’m sorry but if I can afford to…"
 November 2019,5,Fantastic family hotel & great location.,"We stayed here for 5 nights as a family with half board for my daughters birthday. Location was great, located centrally in Marrakech all the touristic sights were 5-10 mins away by taxi. Hotel room and layout was superb, staff were all very kind and really attentive during our stay. Breakfast was excellent a wide variety of foods to choose from, great selection for kids too. Pool and gym facilities were good and the small lounge restaurants nearby were convenient for grabbing a small snack during the day. If your looking to relax and unwind from the madness of the medina then the Hotel Spa is where you want to be, its fantastic and my wife loved her treatments there, would highly recommend it. The kids club was the best thing for my 4 year old daughter, all the team looked…"
 December 2019,5,Spa and Massage Treatmen,One of the best spa treatments i‘ve Ever had. I had a 30 min Massage Done By BOUCHRA in the spa area. She has done a excellent job. The spa area is very pleseant and all of the treatments are top. I was Here for 1 week and all of my Treatments were Done By Bouchra! Just ask for her!!
 December 2019,5,Spa Treatment,"I was surprised with a full body massage with Bouchra at Movenpick and she was very lovely, professional and I feel very relaxed. We arrived late for our appointment however the manager allowed us to come through and still gave us a smile. I would return here."

 December 2019,5,Great stay,"Stayed at the hotel with my family for a week, and felt like at home. Very clean rooms, excellent breakfast variety and very friendly and detailed service. Had lunch at the pool restaurant several times, and got a great service and they even remembered all my family’s names! Delicious cocktails and very friendly service at the hotel bar, where we had drinks daily before dinner. Tried the Italian restaurant twice, and my family and I loved it. Overall very personalized service throughout the hotel , and will definitely come back next year. Thank you Movenpick Marrakesh for making our stay a memorable one"
 November 2019,4,Vacation,"Provided room was quite good but being next to Lift that caused lot of noises every 2 -3 minutes. It was very disturbing mainly at night. Having raised issue to Laela Haily, Supervisor who was very considerate and helpful, changed room to Suit room. It was very commendable of her action. Room cleaners Rogia, Khadija, Nezha who were very very listening and leaving room spotless and attentive to our requests. They are really very good to her assignment. Morning breakfast along with waiters and waitress were great. Hence overall our stay for 7 days was fantastic."
 November 2019,5,Excellent hospitality,"Luxury at its best ., breakfast buffet was amazing and delicious. People at reception like ottoman helped us to book dinner at best dining places , Fatima zahra served us with great hospitality at breakfast . The facilities of spa , Hammam were outstanding. Will visit again"
 November 2019,5,Amazing staff!,"The Movenpick is a beautiful hotel set in a great location in Marrakesh. Its a quick walk to the mall and to the bus station. The breakfast is amazing and the artwork is breathtaking. When you enter the lobby, the smell is lovely and everything is just perfect. However, the best part of the hotel was the staff, on our second day we visited the Medina and I left my phone in the taxi. We attempted to chase down the taxi to no avail. I had lost hope, but later that evening I went to the lobby and the three girls (Nezha, Afaf, and Hind) helped me track my phone via Find my phone, in addition, they used their personal phones to try and ring my international number. Story short, two additional guys one named Faisal, and the other guy who translated for my husband also helped.…"

Thank you so much again for making my birthday weekend so special. Tosin"
 November 2019,5,Marrakech Nov 2019,"I was so glad I booked this hotel when I arrived. It was beautiful and it really felt like you were at a five star resort which was a great start to the holiday. It has several pools, restaurants, onsite shops, funky modern art and a spa. It is also in a good central location within 10 minutes taxi ride to Jemma El Fina and the popular clubs and high end restaurants. It's also a 10 minute walk from Menara Mall which is a modern shopping mall with many shops and restaurants. The best thing about the hotel are the staff. They are very hospitable and friendly but I'd like to make a special mention for Nezha who was really welcoming and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble so it really made our stay enjoyable and memorable and I'm really looking forward to going back and booking…"
 November 2019,5,Mrs,"Great hotel. The facility is absolutely beautiful. The service was top notch. Really enjoyed my stay. I would like to give a special shout out to Med Admine, a server in the restaurant. He went above and beyond to make sure me and my friends were well serviced. Thank you Med Admine!!!"
 November 2019,4,A very nice resort style hotel,"We stayed at this hotel as a part of a tour. This is a very nice hotel with multiple pools, restaurants and a poolside bar. It is located in an area of large hotels. The Medina is walkable but a long walk. You would probably want to take a taxi to the Medina and back if you want to visit it, It is a resort style of a hotel and there were a lot of families there. If that is what you are looking for, this is a great choice for a hotel. If you are looking for a hotel that is convenient to get to the Medina, there would be more convenient hotels."
 November 2019,5,AMAZING HOTEL!,The walk up the hotel reception is just something else! This hotel impressed me for the price I paid! I was checked in by HANAN who upgraded us to a suite and was very helpful! SAID the concierge was friendly and gave great information! Thanks to you both - they gave insightful information that was good value for money. Hotel breakfast was a good variety. 5-6pm was chocolate hour at reception - free chocolate and biscuits! I’d pay double what I paid for this hotel easily! See you all again soon!
 November 2019,5,Best service ever...😍 with Mohammed amin,"He make me feel very comfortable, and I felt like home ... I will definitely came back here thanks to him... He’s service was super nice and kind. The hotel is very clean and nice. Hope to find him again here."
 November 2019,5,This hotel made my stay very enjoyablew,"From the second I checked in, the staff at this hotel made my stay very enjoyable and smooth. The customer service was impeccable - from the staff ensuring you are comfortable and happy to recommending the best foods and places. The hotel was beautiful and the rooms are a good size with comfortable beds you struggle to get out of in the morning haha. Whilst staying here, all the staff were helpful but mainly Brahim who would look after us in the morning by serving us moroccan tea and checking to see if we wanted anything else, to a lady called Naima who was very kind and ensured our stay was of not only the best."
 November 2019,5,Brahim,"Good morning, Just to say Brahim the waiter at the food hall was so amazing! Always welcoming and helpful. Always attended to our needs. The hotel as a whole was amazing. Housekeeper however don’t really speak English so it was abit hard but overall 5*!!"
 November 2019,5,"Amazing massage, great hotel.","Just left the spa and had to recommend khadija for massage. The hotel is great. The beds are like clouds. The pool is like a bath. Breakfast, whilst a little frantic is good. The room behind the pool bar with the massive chairs was like a place to curl up and sleep. And when you’re relaxed, there’s chocolate hour!! Great find and would certainly return."
 November 2019,5,What an experience,I just loved my stay at this lovely hotel my four day stay I just wished it was longer the staff here were the most friendly I’ve ever come across right from day one I was greeted by a very friendly host Naseema who showed me everything around the breakfast hall Fatima zahra a sweet young waitress couldn’t do enough for us nothing was too much trouble and everything with a smile brahim was equally good and Dua who I believe was in charge of the HR was very professional and actually helped us to extend our stay as our flight was quite late in the evening a true gem in the midst of Marrakesh
 November 2019,5,Movenpick,"I want to thanks MÖVENPICK for their welcoming Also and especially i want to thanks MERIEM MAZL & OUMAIMA BEN LABSIN for their services and hospitality. #MyRoomSmellSoFresh&Clean You guys have made my days better, thanks a lot."
 October 2019,4,BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE,"5 days stay in October, full hotel, but the service was still impeccable! Clean and comfortable rooms! Helpful and kind staff! Full international breakfast but also full of Moroccan specialties! All great! But I especially wanted to thank the gym staff who knew how to fulfill my daughter's needs perfectly, competently and attentively. we had a suite for 5 people, and it was wonderful, cared for in every little detail from rose petals to flowers and the ever-present macarone decorated with funny emojis that the children loved!"
 November 2019,1,Salaheddine the worst employee on the Hotel,If you want to enjoy your stay.avoid any contact with this person.so rude doesnt know how to speak with the clients.infortunately there is a lot of good hotels at marrakech.never come back.No thanks..

 August 2019,5,Excellent service!,"We had a family holiday and stayed at the movenpick which I had previously been before and again the service was excellent. The staff especially the waiting staff Layla and her colleagues made us feel so welcome the Chef even accommodated for us, the manager sorted a problem out very quickly and efficiently! We all loved it including the children and definitely will be back again God willing."
 October 2019,4,Great location and lovley Staff,"I stayed at the Movenpick hotel for 3 days between October 21st to October 23rd, I checked out because I was planning to stay in different hotel for experience. The hotel I changed to didn't meet up my expectation so I decided to go back to Movenpick, all the rooms were pretty much booked at the Movenpick, How ever the reception girl Hannane who was super friendly and have helped us few times with our staying and places tips, have put more effort to assist us of finding room. I do appreciate this great service this girl have offered us even they were super busy on that day, all hotel team were super friendly and helpful and they always put the time to answer your questions but Hannane was absolutely a person that made things happened and made us appreciate how this hotel value…"
 October 2019,3,Great Hotel. Poor service,Really like the hotel. The junior suite was spacious and very clean. What lets this hotel down is the service in the bars and restaurants. The pool bar service is particularly bad as the staff just want to huddle at the side of the bar talking rather than serving. You could die of thirst waiting for a drink. Very poor.
 October 2019,4,International chain with a Moroccan twist,Positives about this place: - Impressive entrance and interior design which gives an image of Moroccan grandeur - Large selection of food at breakfast buffet which stays till 10:30. I sincerely appreciate the young gentlemen who prepares the eggs (he can make a very delicious omelette). - Clean and spacious rooms - AMAZING and highly resourceful concierge. Mr. Amine is truly a gem in this place. He truly presents a 5 star experience with his positive and warm attitude. He is very attentive to all guests and the Movenpick is truly lucky to have him on board. - Great location. Safe in the Eglise area of Marrakech. Negatives (potential to improve): - Slow check-in and check-out (they really need to improve their reception service) - Huge property. We were not aware of this! Our…
 October 2019,3,Nice Hotel with lots of potential but not five star,"There is a lot to like about the Movenpick Marrakech - Superior rooms are of a good standard. Breakfast is excellent. The pool area is spacious. Pool and cleaning staff are extremely conscientious and friendly. We had nice meals at the various Resturants. Notable employees included Ghizlane from the cleaning staff, Hind at reception and the lady who made the Omelettes. However there are a number of things which lets this hotel down badly but notably Reception staff - genearlly have little attention to customers needs. On one day, we asked for assistance about a tour to the Majorelle Gardens and was told to look at the internet or come back the next day when the concierge would be available. Even worst on checkout, we were asked to stand in a separate queue and were left…"
 October 2019,5,Ô De Rose Spa,"Having never experienced a Hammam before I didn’t really know what to expect. The staff at Ô De Rose on the Mövenpick Hotel, Marrakech are all very accommodating and welcoming. I was given water and tea before my treatment and made to feel at home. Then I was put in the very capable and reassuring hands of Kaltoum, who very professionally provided a detoxifying, relaxing and cleansing Hammam experience I will never forget and will definitely have again! For anyone wondering about Hammams, I can certainly recommended having one, especially at the wonderful venue Ô De Rose and I hope you are lucky enough to meet and be treated by Kaltoum. ☺️🧖🏻‍♀️💆🏻‍♀️❤️🙏"
 October 2019,5,The Spa,"It has been three months in Morocco and have not found a better tech than Najia. To anyone visiting whether or pleasure be sure to request Ms. Najia for your services, and the reasons why I would come back to Mövenpick Marrakech."
 October 2019,5,What a great pleasant surprise for such a huge hotel.,"Great surprise for an extended weekend in Marrakech. Every year we celebrate our honeymoon. Having stayed in Marrakech many times before like the Mamounia and different Riads in the Madina. we didn’t know what to expect and are pleasantly surprised. Despite the hotel being so huge it doesn’t feel that way, the spacious rooms are spread of a number of Villas, the walkways are surrounded by lush greens and great lighting. Plenty of pools, from large to small. Breakfast is amazing, difficult to restrain oneself from eating too much, the fresh made orange juice and Moroccan pancakes where my favorite. We had dinner at the hotel for our first night, too tired to go out, it was exceptional especially the service. Special thanks to Hasna in reservations, the front desk, i wish i got…"
 August 2019,4,Lovely decor,Lovely hotel with lots of hidden treasures by way of art work and decor of the public areas. Just loved the ambiance of the hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Stayed in the main block and the lift was a bit hard to find initially - all part of the fun!. My room didn't quite live up to the rest of the hotel. Despite being a non-smoking room it smelled of stale cigarette smoke and was rather small. Loved the rest of the hotel so much I didn't really mind. Truly awesome breakfast spread with a wide array of continental and Moroccan dishes. Nice pool area with a resort feel which could get a bit noisy during the day with the loud music played by a DJ. However there were several other pools including a quiet one near the spa. Several different eating options available within…
 October 2019,5,Fabulous,"Definitely highly recommend this hotel. Very comfortable, friendly attentive staff and excellent food. The rooms are spacious and the beds heavenly! Gorgeous black marble bathroom with separate loo. Also the hotel is very quiet. We had a massage which was lovely, the spa and gym facilities are beautiful. As you walk through the hotel you are surrounded with gorgeous smells. It’s about a 10 min taxi ride to the Médina, there were always taxis outside. There is a street next to the hotel that has modern restaurants and a supermarket. If I went back to Marrakech I’d stay here again."
 August 2019,5,Just fabulous,"Just fabulous,the staff were very helpful and friendly specially MRS harbi saida ,she makes us feeling very welcoming and also she provides us everything we need for our kids in Mehdi,we really apreciate the quality of the service and how clean were the suit,absolutly i récord it"

 October 2019,3,Beautiful Nice Hotel with Unfair Service Treatment,"The hotel it's impressive from the arrival. The architecture and the forniture and decoration it's amazing in all corners. But, to check in with a non smiling reception staff that takes 350€ from you credit card as deposit without warning firstly, it's not a good start. Another collegues travelling with me were taken up to 900€, this while our accomodation was previously paid. So they charge as they feel with the excuse that this way you have money in the room account to pay any orders at the bars or restaurants. This is another point to review. The prices of the food and beverage it's simply too expensive. 9€ for a glass of house wine or 7€ for a local beer it's too much in a slow and not smiling service. About the service, as low is the job position as more as they smile and…"
 October 2019,4,Very nice Kids Club,The Kids Club Staff is very nice and friendly and professionel. Program varies every day. Rest of the hotel is pretty old. Pool area not maintained. Spa staff professional but premises neglected. Spa Manager is missing. Watch out mainly Conferences and reception staff is not very friendly.
 October 2019,4,Large hotel with beautiful grounds,"I came here with a Gate 1 tour and was very impressed by the grounds and public areas. It's beautiful to walk around and discover all the art work and decor. The room was nice, mostly average with weak air conditioning. The bed was very comfy. I did the Royal Hammam treatment in the spa which was a unique experience. Not totally relaxing because it's a serious exfoliation, but the spa set up was lovely and the attendant gave good service. My only gripe was the service at the pool bar as it was slow and not attentive. I had to finally get up and ask for the check at the bar because the server never came back. I did get a margherita pizza there and it was pretty tasty. I think you'll be pleased to stay at the hotel and only a couple minor adjustments would make it 5 star."
 October 2019,3,Rooms are fine ac is missing,The hotel is fine the rooms are nice the breakfast is fine the one criticism is the AC was practically off Even after service by maintenance that got the air flow to work there was still no cooling effect from the noisy unit
 September 2019,5,Morocco Tour,"Wow - modern large hotel with great Moorish touches. Impressive pool, very professional staff, wonderful food and easy walk / taxi to many other restaurants and sights. Wonderful public areas, comfortable discrete seating - recommended!"
 October 2019,5,Staff du Movenpick,"Great hotel and staff, the pool is amazing, Abdelkarime et Mohammed Amine looked after us with big smile everytime, they where warm, friendly and helpful. Thanks to both of you and thank movenpick...."
 September 2019,5,Wonderful Stay,"I travel for work a lot, and I stay at chain hotel most of the times. I have never been disappointed at all using Movenpick Marrakech. Thanks for the friendliness and helpfulness of the reception personnel, namely Nezha, she’s been incredibly helpful which I am great full for. She’s an asset to Movenpick Marrakech, praise her. The breakfast was also my top highlight. The buffet has almost everything you need. The coffee is sooooo good. The staff were helpful especially the smiley lady I don’t remember her name. She’s great."
 September 2019,5,Restaurant at breakfast... excellent service Mohammed Amin and Karim were superb,"I come here regularly and breakfast is always a pleasure. Hotel a real maze but beautiful. Porters excellent too. No complaints. The pool and the pool bar really nice , very comfortable . You must try the pancake at breakfast it’s delicious."
 September 2019,5,Amazing breakfast!!,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. Only 15 mins from the airport. Staff are very attentive. Special shout out to Taha in the breakfast room, he was superb. We would recommend this hotel to anyone. Be careful with the taxis outside the hotel (or anywhere in Marrakesh). The guys on the front door to the hotel can advise a ball park figure for what you should be paying which is handy. Make sure you agree the price before getting in the cab. Once you are in, enjoy the ride, because the way the traffic flows and driving is an experience."
 September 2019,5,Wonderful Hotel,5 star hotel and service. Ideally located. The breakfast was truly marvelous and had everything that one could wish for in the morning. The servers were very friendly and helpful. Would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends visiting Marrakech.
 September 2019,5,Marrakech 2019,"Booked as a 60th birthday present the hotel went out of their way to make it a very memorable experience. We arrived late morning but recognising very quickly that we would have caught an early flight and would be hungry, Mohammed (Manager) from the restaurant treated us like guests in his home. Despite the breakfast service being over with he served us everything he thought we would like. On arrival our room was upgraded to a suite, and during the stay the hotel had arranged for the room to be decorated, and a cake to celebrate. Waited on like royalty every morning by the waiters at breakfast and the staff at reception always offering exceptional service, there was no single thing one could fault or complain about. Thank you to all at the hotel whose path we crossed,…"
 September 2019,5,Vacations 2019,"Hi! this was my first time visiting Marrakesh, Morroco and I had the pleasure to stay in this awesome Mövenpick Hotel. I just want to share my unforgettable experience since day one of my arrival.....I was greeted by the Hotel staff with a very friendly smile. I want to point out specially every morning in the Restaurant when I was having my Breakfast a waiter a very young nice looking man approached to my table and a very polite way he introduced himself as Mohamed Skiriba. He asked me how are you Madan ? And if I want a coffee. For the three mornings that I have a breakfast there he with his kindness really made me feel like at home. This Hotel itself is amazing, beautiful, comfortable, relaxing, but with the upstanding service by the charming and friendly employees like…"
 September 2019,4,Beautiful hotel,"I visited the hotel in September with my mum and it was amazing from the beginning. The decor is stunning, the staff were attentive and welcoming but one particularly stood out for us. His name was Mohammed Amine and he went to every length to ensure all our needs were met during breakfast. He’s a fantastic waiter and really made our stay all the more enjoyable. The hotel are lucky to have to him on board! The rooms were really nice too, well air conditioned and clean! The house keeping staff always fulfilled our requests too which was perfect! Overall we’d rate our stay very good and we would definitely recommend staying here; we both really enjoyed ourselves. The only downside was everything you pay for within the hotel, whether it’s food/massage etc is a lot more expensive…"
 September 2019,5,O De Rose Spa,The Hannah bath was something to die for. The 90 minute massage was excellent. The therapist were sincere in assisting. My wife and I were happy with our treatments. We forgot we were in another country and we wanted to book another appointment immediately.
 September 2019,5,Kids club at Mövenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi,"Words can not express our gratitude to the ladies from the kids club, namely, Nezha, Zahira, Touria and NouJoud. Not only did they look after our son with care and attention. They also organised a birthday party for our son at a very short notice, which he celebrated with his international friends.The ladies did an amazing job, which exceeded our expectations, we are truly grateful. Thank you again ladies, and keep up the great work. We look forward to seeing you again on our next visit."
 October 2018,4,"Very, very good! (And it is not too big!)","Very good hotel, service and location. Beautifully decorated and nice garden and pool. Super friendly staff. It has a large number of rooms, but it feels like a much smaller and cosier hotel. I can really recommend this place."
 July 2019,4,Long overdue review,"Excellent service here! The front desk agents (Nezha & Souhail) and the restaurant staff at Urban Brasserie were friendly and helpful. The pools were never crowded so it was plenty relaxing. We had two adjoining rooms - with a lot of space and a back patio for each room. Bathrooms were extremely spacious I could do yoga in it. The only thing I would be wary of are the taxi cab drivers that linger outside of the hotel looking for someone to overcharge for a ride to the Medina. With careful bargaining you can avoid the switch and bait. However, this should not deter Western travelers from enjoying this beautiful place (it's only a small nuance which you'll laugh about later)."
 September 2019,4,Good Stay,"Namaste! I stayed at your property during the PURE Travel event and I really liked the hotel for its central location, large rooms and good service. I would especially like to thank Bouchra, Front office, for the help extended to me during my stay. I will certainly book myself here for next years event."
 September 2019,3,"Customer service, timeliness and 5 star standards","I am on my 6th out of 8 day stay at the Mövenpick Marrakech. The hotel’s entrance is quite grand which gives a good first impression to guests. However the standard goes downhill from there pretty quickly. 1. 4 out of the 5 staff at the Jamra restaurant are rather abrupt. Service is very slow, and inefficient regardless whether busy or not. That was my first stop to grab a light lunch after I had checked in. I returned the next day for a quick bite in between outings. Same experience: forgotten to set my table whilst I was waiting. Had to go and get salt and pepper from another table, olive oil from the main counter..I have not gone back there since. Visit was @afternoon of Sunday 8th September around 3pm and again on Monday 10th September at the same time. Needless to say I…"
 August 2019,2,Not my kind of 5 star hotel,"Not sure how this is considered a 5 star hotel but it doesnt fly by my standards. I met 2 friendly staff members and thats about it. The hotel room is small, okay, however the shower pressure or just the shower head was so poor that my head was basically against the wall in order to get water on my head. The hose that is next to the toilet was broken and broken on the wall as well. The toilet stopped working at one point and didnt flush and my biggest concern was the the sliding door (we were on the first floor) didnt even shut / lock. I couldnt sleep the entire night knowing that the door was just open. zero security around the premises (unlike the four seasons). Our suitcases were lost so we had to keep calling out to call our credit card company and airline and we had to call…"
 September 2019,5,Kids Club - Thanks a lot!,"I spent 6 days at the hotel, and during working days, we left our son in the Kids Club. All the ladies there were extremely friendly! Our kid loved to go there, and when he arrived, he hugged them. I would like to thank Touria, Nezha that were very friendly and took special care of our son. And specially Zahira, who was taking care of our son most days! Thanks a lot, and next time we are back, we know we have an amazing place to leave our son! Regarding the place, is quite big, it has different type of games, for different ages. And everything seems to be very baby and toodler friendly!"
 September 2019,3,Average,"We're staying here for a trade show in the attached convention centre - this is definitely not a place I would choose to stay at otherwise if it weren't for the convenience of it. Most of the staff are friendly, but don't ask for anything one minute past their ""closing time"" because you won't get it... I had to beg for just a glass of wine after a long day of work and literally one minute past their closing time of 6:45 pm. We had dinner at their restaurant one night - it was buffet style and all the left overs that we had been served for lunch that same day. Housekeeping is never consistent and comes at all different times, half does your room and then comes back again. I never get the coffee / sugar / cream supplied in the same fashion every day. There's always something…"
 September 2019,5,PURE Life Experiences,"I booked an hour facial just to get relaxed after been jet lagged going for a few days. What a great decision as it was one of the best facials I've ever had (and trust me i've done facials at several luxury, 5-star resorts throughout the world)! Khadija was my therapist. She did such a phenomenal job I immediately went to the reception and booked her for a full body massage. Khadija is amazing and very knowledgable. If you ever get the chance I highly recommend the spa services and please make sure you ask for Khadija as you won't regret it!"
 September 2019,5,Best hairdresser in town,"I had the pleasure to have my hair done by a very professional stylist, Ms Khadija at the hair salon at the Moevenpick. I highly recommend her, she is amazing! I will surely come back and ask for her next time!"
 August 2019,3,Hotel,"Housekeeping rather poor, bathroom not very clean. A very noisy hotel more like a Spanish party hotel for teenagers. Tiny balcony. Expensive drinks & wine with prices not consistent from one eating & drinking venue to another. A very nice spa pool & terrace away from the rest of the noisy & crowded hotel leisure areas. Certainly not a 5star hotel experience."
 September 2019,5,most amazing hotel ever!!!,After reading some of the reviews I was a bit skeptical about staying new in this hotel however from when we got there till the end of our stay the service was beyond amazing and everyone was so helpful and polite. We also had dinner in the hotel which was amazing and the breakfast was delicious every morning too. We also stayed in a superior room with a garden view and the view was beautiful! Would definitely recommend staying in this hotel and would love to come back again :)
 August 2019,5,Signature Massage,"Excellent service, she is very good at the job. She is every experienced and deserves to be rewarded. She is a good professional. She is friendly and kind and offered me water. I will recommend her to all my friends and family and I will definitely come back.Her name is Najia."
 August 2019,5,The best!,"Good time and quality massage. You should try!!!everything was excellent, good atmosphere and perfect techiques. Once in a lifetime experience. She is a great person and a great professional. You will wish the massage it will last forever:)) try it, you will never forget!!!"
 July 2019,5,Movenpick Marrakesh is simply the best!,"My family enjoyed our stay at this very beautiful Movenpick hotel. The decor, grounds, ambience and service is outstanding. The hotel is very well located near the airport as well as in close access to the city center and easy access to transportation. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The restaurants were also exceptionally nice. Shout out to the beautiful and very professional staff at the front desk - Laila, Nadia and Hind. They helped to make our stay very pleasant indeed!"
 August 2019,5,Mrs,About breakfast lady FATIMA EZZAHRA at MOROCCON TEA service at Movenpick Very nice girl excellent service always smiling Well done Really impress with every person here Very nice ppl Really like the service
 August 2019,2,Avoid,"Me and my friends stayed here for 4 nights in the junior suites. The hotel is in a great location, scores of restaurants and the mall close by. It is also close to the airport around 10-15mins via taxi which is great after travelling all day so you can get to your room and relax asap. NOT in our case, we arrived at the hotel around 8pm and our rooms were not ready. I found this absurd as that room would have been empty when the previous guests checked out at the very latest 11am that day. Reception simply told us to wait in the lobby. I was not happy and after complaining was offered a drink. I said I'm hungry after a long day of travelling and to the hotels credit they gave us pizzas and drinks by the pool free of charge. The junior suites were incredible inside,…"
 August 2019,5,SPA Excellente experience,Excellent experience at the SPA this afternoon. Special thanks to Khadija massage and Touriya Goumez. A service worthy of the quality standards of a movenpick. Very good location at the city center near to Menara Mall
 August 2019,1,Not a 5 star at all!,"This hotel should never be a 5 star. Maybe maybe it should be a 4 star. All over booking places it says family hotel, that’s ok, because it’s lots of pools. So you think that’s no problem. But this hotel should be named to Movenpick KIDS hotel. Way to many kids. And the hotel is big. There is not enough sun beds at all! People wake up at 8 in the morning and “reserves” the beds, even the swim guards reserves for family’s and they get paid by them! This is very annoying, and the hotel just accept it! The breakfast is the same every day! The rooms are old, the aircoindition in the rooms sounds like a jet engine. It’s a a lot of loud music at night. I recommend this hotel ONLY for family’s with kids! This hotel is just hyped up by the name."
 August 2019,5,De Rose Hammam and Spa a must.,Having not had a hammam experience before I found Julia to be exceptional at guiding me through the elaborate process brilliantly. The 5 minute steam followed by a series of vigorous scrubbing and rinsing left years of dead skin on the cool marble slab I was lying on. Julia had firm hands and a ready smile which added to the whole relaxing experience. Now I just need to add hammam to my beauty routine regularly! Thank you Julia!
 August 2019,5,Friendliness,"I have stayed in this hotel many times during the past 3 years, this year for several weeks. After 43 years in aviation and close to 100 hotel nights per year, this hotel is certainly on my top 10 list with regards to value for money. The facilities and restaurants are hard to match, but what impresses me most is the friendliness of the staff. Aspecially the pool staff, but also cleaners, reception and waiters appears to be top motivated and always receive you with a smile. Whatever you need they will provide it, always with a pleasant attitude and some kind words. I can most certainly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially frequent travellers."
 August 2019,2,No air conditioning and lots of noise,"PROS: The hotel and grounds are lovely. The staff of the restaurant and restaurant was extremely good. Unfortunately, those positives end there. CONS: Where do I start? There were two major issues with this property. NOISE: Until about 12:30am there is extremely loud banging that goes on from the music they play downstairs. This music wasn’t that much of a bother to me because I stay up until late and it happens at other properties. If you are a light sleeper, DO NOT stay here! HOT ROOMS: Marrakesh tends to be pretty warm in the summer. The first room I had, 1303 was extremely hot. They sent in engineering, which brought the temperature to 25C (about 78/79F). I stayed the night and while touring, I asked my tour manager to call and ask them if the issue was solved. …"
 August 2019,2,Disappointing experience,"I am staying here on business. the hotel on first sight looks nice enough with separate buildings and a pseudo Moroccan architectural design. The interior is a strange mixture of oversized furniture and bizarre decor. There is a large and smaller swimming pool with bars attached, the problem is the larger pool is dominated by a sound system that plays continuous loud music throughout the day and night! It can be heard from 200 metres away and means one can't have the window open without the incessant noise ruining one's time off. It seems bizarre such a hotel that appeals to everyone has this policy more suited to a 20-30 something age group. I'm only glad I'm not paying to stay here. Other than that, things are okay, the staff are nice, but it took an inordinate amount of time…"
 August 2019,1,Pool daypass,Very bad connection with the hotel by phone and when the receptioniste called from our hotel to the pool they said it is only for hotel guests. On the website it says that it is possible but on the phone it was not. Bad service
 August 2019,5,Superb Kids Club,"impressively splendid kidz club, friendly and approachable staff. Well led, supervisor is apprachable and always smilling Great hotel to choose if you have children Suitable up to 12 years old My daughter Suraya loved it, full of fun and every day different activities I would not hesitate to recommend to families with children Well done team - Keep it up"
 August 2019,5,Very good experience,"Wonderful hotel. Very convenient I enjoyed everything in the hotel, the room was great, very clean and i am very happy with how well the housekeeping staff cleaned the room everyday, the room service i got with the happy birthday cake was beyond amazing, and the staff in the pool were just great. No negative comments in this stay, everything was amazing. Good job to all the staff and looking forward for my next visit. Thank you"
 August 2019,3,"5 star setting, 2 star service","I’m writing this review halfway through my current stay, that itself speaks to something. Don’t get me wrong the setting is beautiful and our room is well kempt. But appearance does not make a hotel 5 stars. The place is teaming with staff, you’ll never see more employees in one space, but the service is beyond slow and on several occasions already they have attempted to overcharge for drinks etc. The hotel also advertises several restaurants that do not in fact exist. As I’m writing this I’m sitting in my hotel bedroom nursing an all day bout of food poisoning which I am positive I got from here as it is the only place I’d eaten in the 40hrs before the illness started. Worst of all for me the brand prides itself on “sustainability”. This is the most unsustainable establishment…"
 August 2019,5,our favorite hotel in Marrakesh,"This is our second time at the Movenpick. We love it because it's family friendly, the design is beautiful, the staff is super friendly, and the breakfast buffet is just great! The kids club is what absolutely sold us on coming back. My girls have so much fun doing lots of activities, swimming, cooking and playing.. Touria was exceptionally helpful and knows how to deal with children. honestly, the best option as far as family friendly hotels that doesn't skimp on the other things.."
 July 2019,5,unforgettable stay,"I have stayed in the Movenpik Marrakeh in july, it's one of the finest in the world. the rooms are fantastic, the staff extremely attentive and what you would expect at a Movenpik. The grounds are impecably maintened, the pool is an ouasis, amazing spa, great kid's room, restaurants are all wonderfull. a big thank you to the pool crew tarik, abdulhaq and imad and to everyone who made our stay an unforgettable experiene. We had a wonderfull week and are definitely coming bak."
 August 2019,5,Memorable experience,Wonderful memorable experience staying at the movenpick hotel. The hotel staff were all so accommodating especially Naima who helped with breakfast every day. She made it very easy by delivering breakfast to our tables. She was brilliant and nothing was too much effort for her Adil was so accommodating with helping with delivering the luggage to our rooms even after changing rooms a few times. Lubna was very accommodating with housekeeping making sure our rooms were fully equipped with all the necessities.
 July 2019,5,Top-Hotel in Marrakech,"We had a wonderful stay in a quite, spacy and very clean superior room in this outstanding Hotel in July 2019. We would like to thank the staff to make our stay memorable and comfortable at all times. Our special thanks to Nossima M.from the pool restaurant and Brahim from the breakfast area for their always lovely and helpful asisstance!"
 August 2019,5,Lovely hotel lovely people,"From the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming and friendly. a Adil was so patient with us taking our group luggage between 4 separate rooms and dealing with a family of 8 adults and a baby. Lynn's the housekeeper excellent cleaning up after he young ones, and Naima at the breakfast lounge was so attentive to all our individual needs/allergies. All the people and more made our stay very pleasurable. The hotel is beautiful and peaceful."
 August 2019,5,"Excellent service
Movenpick Marrakech",I am currently here with my family and 1 year old grandson. Customer service is brilliant. All the staff are friendly and polite. The rooms are lovely and there are lots of communal lounges to sit in. Breakfast buffet is excellent with something for everyone. Naima looks after us every morning and brings us our endless cups of tea to the table. Thank you so much to everyone at the Movenpick for making our stay so enjoyable. We have a few more days left and are going to make the most of it. BRILLIANT!
 August 2019,5,Excellent service,"Had a lovely trip to Marrakech and stayed at the Movenpic hotel. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. As I was travelling with my 1 year old, I was very worried about coping but staff took care of everything. During the breakfast buffet, one of the staff, Naima, was beyond helpful. She would bring things to the table, even though it was a buffet to make things easier for feeding my baby. During breakfast she word help us with plans for the day and even suggest good things to do."
 August 2019,5,"Great fun, amazing food, super service","It was the best steak I ve ever had. Cooked perfectly to my order, amazing taste. Food was beyond expectation as well as service. Really good fun and really awesome attitude DIEGO/ Mohammed. He made our experience absolutely unforgettable. Even a little detail like a ketchup, or pictures... or simply anything we needed to have a great experience he did!!! 100% super service!!!! When I go to Marrakech again- MOVENPICK - will be first in my list!!! Thanks you guys for a lovely dinner! Special thanks to Diego ( bosa bosa)"
 July 2019,4,"Great hotel but could be better, careful with the activities they sell you.","Outstanding resort that needs a facelift in the elevators ,lobbies of the rooms buildings and spa.Great location close to shops, central station, restaurants and airport. 7 minutes taxi ride to the Medina and the Fna Square at EUR 5 a ride or 50 DM nice rooms with great bathrooms.Outstanding pool area and amazing main lobby. Great breakfast buffet in a nice patio . On the negative side, be very careful with the activities and excursions you buy from the front desk...They play with the prices as they wish."
 July 2019,5,Summer Holiday,"Absolutely love this hotel. We used the pool facilities nearly every day of our holiday. Everything is brilliant, the beds are really comfortable, the swimming pool was a perfect relief to a very hot day & towels are readily available. There is a newly added pizza oven which I took advantage of regularly. The team who attend to customers by the pool are so attentive - we were remembered again by Jihane & Anas. Their attention to detail is beyond excellent. Spotting when things need fixing. I am already planning my next trip for 2020 A***"
 August 2019,5,Magic Place,"Me and my boyfriend we have been there one week in August 2019 and we can say that it was a great place to stay in Marrakech. The breakfast was amazing, our waiter, Mohamed Skiriba was gentle. The only thing that we didn’t appreciate was pool that was always overcrowded."
 August 2019,5,@breakfeast,yassine hadhoumi @ restaurant saray give d me and my family an exellent service. Verry Nice and helpfull. Next year i Will comme back! Also Naima and brahim where out standing People with a verry classy service thx for that moment off real vacation feeling. I Will recommend this service to my whole Family.
 August 2019,5,Very good,"Very good stay, service was amazing and staff were very helpful especially Fatima Zahra, she was a great help during the breakfast service making sure we had everything we needed and more. Would highly recommend."
 July 2019,5,Relax in lovely environnement,We stayed in the hôtel last week and the service was nothing short of excellent. All the staff are very helpful.i was very impressed with laila restaurant. She gave us excellent servise in restaurant. Always looking dor ways to help and always smaling. The hôtel room are very nice.clean and have their own class about room The pool area is beautiful Breakfast is really good All in all reccomend this place
 July 2019,5,Beautiful,Overall beautiful hotel - pools are amazing - the restaurants are jot overpriced - all the staff is very polite - breakfast came with our room and the buffet was wonderful - Yassine waited on my table a couple days in a row and he was lovely. Merci beaucoup!!
 July 2019,5,Mira Feghali,We spent four days at this outstanding resort in Marrakech. Customer service was excellent with the help of Afaf and Nadia. They were both excellent and knowledgeable. Breakfast was also good with a big variety of options. I can only highly recommend this resort!!
 June 2019,5,Everything was as promised !,"Great hotel, lovely clean space, amazing service! Hind at reception desk and arrival was probably the most friendly and helpful. Overall, good accommodation for a reasonable price. we would definately stay again"
 July 2019,5,Hanane is the best,"Hi , I would like to point out this amazing person me and my friend met at the hotel reception. Hanane is the best employee of the hotel the most smiley person and the most helpful. She helped us book restaurants and assisted with anything else we required. We laughed a lot and made our stay much much pleasant."
 July 2019,5,Amazing,"We visited marrakech in July 7th for my birthday celebration. I could only say without Hanane (she is the receptionist at the Hotel), my trip would not had been so memorable. What Hannane did which made it so special? So I went back to our hotel room as you do, I saw a cake with a beautiful flowers all over, it took me by surprise and what a nice surprise! Not only did she went over and above her call of duties, it was really the thoughts she put in which made it so special and unforgettable. Truly a kind young lady. I would think all company would want an employee like her. Thank you Hannane we will see you again really soon :)"
 July 2019,3,No pool pass,"We wanted to spend a day at a hotel pool towards the end of our trip, and saw a few (recent) articles which recommended the Movenpick Hotel. Unfortunately when we arrived they said that the pool was for use by guests only, and they no longer allow visitors to use the pool. We went to Novotel Hotel instead which I can thoroughly recommend."
 July 2019,4,Nice but over priced,This is a lovely hotel in a great location. The staff were very polite and helpful. Unfortunately the food and minibar are way over priced.Brahim at breakfast was very helpful and couldn't do enough for you so I thank him.we had a junior suite which was lovely but again over priced. We had a lovely time at the hotel but £6.50 for a small can of coke and £15.00 for a club sandwich ruined the experience.
 July 2019,4,Good / improvement,"We stayed here in July . The hotel can arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel if pre booked . Unfortunately Marrakech airport is very busy and it took ages to clear immigration . We didn’t see our driver in the arrival hall and missed him so don’t go outside the airport otherwise they won’t let you back in, in the end the driver found us .. excellent Check in was good , we booked a junior suite OMG it was huge , large lounge and bedroom, fantastic bathroom and terrace to sit out on, the suites are located in the quiet part of the hotel -it’s worth up grading as far I can see the standard rooms balconies are very small . Unfortunately the costs of the mini bar are crazy as well as room service , £6 Euro for a can of coke , £15 for a burger- I know it’s a 5 star…"
 July 2019,5,Beautiful hotel and friendly staff,Stayed in this hotel for a week with my family and everything was great! There were multiple pools and the hotel itself is located near a number of attractions and restaurants. The staff here are also super friendly in particular Hind at the front desk was very helpful and Youssef who works in the restaurant was always very attentive and ready to get us anything we might need. Would recommend this hotel to everyone!
 July 2019,5,Excellent experience,"I had excellent experience at Movenpick Marrakech that is cause best service Offered by stuff at Movenpick . Let me correct my words it is become excellent experience with help of Hanene ( reciptionist) . Thank you for you smiling all the time , Thank you for your perfect english ."
 July 2019,5,Amazing hotel!,"Stayed in this hotel for a week! Everything was great! The pool is amazing and the food is outstanding. We spent most of our time in the hotel because it was too good! They have some of the best staff i have ever seen! Really friendly and always happy to help! Special mention to Hind, Nezha, Hanan and Sounail for making me feel at home. Cant wait to be back again!"
 July 2019,5,STUNNING!,From the moment we walked in we loved the feel and look of the hotel. Hind is the beautiful lady at the front desk. She is absolutely amazing and a superstar. She is always happy and always smiling and extremely helpful. She should manage her own hotel one day.💕💕 Mahmoed and Hamza at the pool bar are the perfect gentleman. They are always making sure that you are having a good time and that you do not lack anything. They make you feel good and welcome every minute. Omar and Amien at breakfast is so friendly and very attentive to you. Always asking if you need anything and always happy to assist. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms are cosy and spacious. I will definitely come stay here again.
 July 2019,1,Avoid! Not worth the cost!,"I don't enjoy writing negative reviews but our stay here was way below the standards of a 5* hotel. On arrival, the staff at the hotel looked utterly miserable and helping us with our luggage seemed as extra work to them. One of the bellboys dropped a few of our bags upto the room, spilling some contents and didn't even bother to apologise let alone help pick the contents up. The rooms were fairly well equipped, however one of our rooms had a broken toilet seat, broken locks & a crib bed rather than a proper bed. We promptly complained to the manager who arrogantly refused to do anything about this. He also refused to give us his name. We spoke to our booking agent and they reported that the manager had offered us a different room which was an obvious lie as we would have…"
 December 2018,4,Good,No complaints about this hotel. Nice and clean. The hotel bars service wasn't great- often hard to find a server. But this could be due to how we arrived about a week before the start of peak season. By the end of the week there were more waiters. The inclusive breakfast was very good.
 July 2019,2,Beautiful Hotel with Subpar Service,"Currently visiting the beautiful country of Morocco with my girlfriend, attempting to enjoy our first time in Africa and we have been repeatedly served with mediocre service from every staff member here. From the time we checked in we have been rushed, from grabbing a drink at dinner to laying out, ordering food at the pool. I was told today that I needed to hurry up and pay for a check in order for the attendant to “watch a match.” We obliged and attempted to pay with a debit card, the card declined and we were told “do you have another card?” in a very accusatory tone. We asked whether or not it may have been the machine, and when he ran the SAME card with a NEW machine, TRANSACTION APPROVED. After we paid, we wanted to continue to enjoy our day by the pool (still here) and…"
 July 2019,3,Very poor service,I am currently staying at this hotel my boyfriend and I have had both drinks at the bar and lunch at the pool. Both times the service has been below average. We are constantly being rushed and quickly asked to pay right after receiving our food. Today at the pool our server asked us if we could please quickly pay so he could go watch a soccer match. Then when trying to pay the card machine would not work and he insisted that there was a problem with my card. I asked him to run my card again and the machine worked. We are trying to have a relaxing holiday and this has made it somewhat unpleasant. We are trying to pay money to their hotel you would think they would at least be friendly.
 June 2019,5,June 22-29/06/19,Excellent hotel I’ve stayed in Marrakech a couple of times now at different hotels and this is the Best one to date The hotel is kept clean to a high standard the staff who greet you as you enter the hotel are polite and courteous this started the weeks stay off well. The accommodation we had was a suite 5103 it was kept so clean and tidy by the maid who was so polite and helpful 👍to this young lady. Kind regards Laurence. PS. To management and staff please kept up the good work you do I will be coming back to stay.
 June 2019,5,Good service,"We had an amazing time in this hotel. The service was excellent. I'd like to say a special thanks to Hind at reception for being so much help. She knew what we needed, when we needed it and most of the time she'd anticipate it before we did! The rooms were fantastic and thoroughly clean and breakfast was excellent!"
 June 2019,3,Mixed experience - CHECK YOUR BILL!,"We got a great deal on secret escapes - £300 for 3 nights, which we thought was good for a supposed 5 star. The hotel has an impressive reception and lobby area, rooms are fairly standard but the bathrooms are nice. Our room was advertised as ‘garden view’ but overlooked a couple of trees and the bin area. Breakfast was good, lots of choice and the lady serving the omelettes was lovely, however every morning the omelettes were quite undercooked with a fair amount of raw egg in the middle. The location isn’t great for the Médina - about a 30 minute + walk. Pool area good, plenty of sunloungers and the majority of the life guards were very attentive in getting towels and umbrellas when needed. The night prior to our departure we asked if there was anywhere we could store our bags…"
 June 2019,3,"Very basic, poor value","Everything in this hotel is way below expectations from declared 5*. Lifts and pool area have a lot of wear and tear, mold, broken tiles and carpet and look more up to 2* standard. Morning buffet is also very basic, minimal selection of food. The hotel is terrible value for money. For the price they charge you can be in real 5* somewhere in Dubai, or in amazing All Inclusive in the best resorts in Egypt. The only place which really lived up to my expectations was the Kids club. Very professional employees perfectly managing their little crew of (sometimes) misbehaving kids, well diversified program 10-18. Great job and thanks for what you are doing!"
 June 2019,5,Incredible Venue,"This was a stop for our tour group in Morocco and was absolutely perfect! It is drop dead gorgeous filled with incredible art pieces, shops, bar, restaurants and anything else you need. The rooms are comfortably furnished and tastefully decorated. Bedding was great, air conditioning was great, drinks, even with ice that’s been made with distilled water, were great. There’s a lovely pool and so many nice touches of fresh roses everywhere. The staff was so helpful, especially since it really is a sort of maize that seems difficult, but becomes easier to navigate with the help of the staff. Highly recommend this lovely gem!"
 June 2019,4,Beautiful but needs attention,"This hotel is really great and would warrant 5 stars but several issues need to be addressed. The elevators are terrible. Broken buttons, broken floor indicators, frequent bumps and lurches make riding them quite uncomfortable. For a luxury hotel chain this is not acceptable. Also guest services staff is not attentive or responsive. We had to call and go to the desk 3 times for a simple request to be handled. Others in our group had similar issues. Pool, restaurant/ Buffett and rooms were great. The parent company of this great hotel chain needs to visit here and see the issues and get them fixed."
 June 2019,4,A comfortable stay,"We stayed for three nights and most of our experience at this hotel has been pleasant. The landscape is beautiful and well maintained. Staff around the pool and breakfast area are fairly attentive and friendly. Plenty of choices are available for breakfast as well. The room is well sized and comfortable with fair level of furnishing. The room services needs to be improved as staffs are not attentive / trained to a 5 stars hotel standard. I need to ask for an item for three times before it was delivered. Overall, we did enjoy the stay. Could the experience be better, yes."
 June 2019,4,Nice hotel,"We had very pleasant experience in this hotel, reception people were accommodating. The restaurant people not as much. Nice pool, great breakfast. We stay for long weekend, could stay little longer. Recommend!"
 April 2019,5,Nice experience,"I had very nice experience at Movenpick Marrekech, or just let me correct my words: it became nice experience with the help of the stuff at Movenpick. First day, I arrived I had some minor problem with my room ( like wash room door does not close correctly), I reported that at the reception. So, they transfer my report to the problem solver Hanane ( receptionist). She render my experience totally different: first she speak perfectly english ( no one else could understand me),she upgrade right away my room, she took care of the transfer my language... She was smiling all the time even after 8 hours of work. If you would like to have nice experience go to Movenpick a’ and go to see Hanane. She will offers you the best service"
 May 2019,5,Well worth the visit,"Marrakech would rate a probably the most interesting place in Morocco to visit. There are lots of high end hotels, lots to do and the Movenpick is up there with them. Public areas are huge, rooms OK for size. Meals were fine, would certainly stay here again. Visiting the Medina especially at night is a must. Taxis are cheap and easy to find. We felt safe here."
 June 2019,2,Mediocre Movenpick Mansour Marrakesh !,"My husband Peter and I stayed at the Movenpick Mansour Eddahbi, Marrakesh from the afternoon of the 9th June until the morning of the 11th June 2019 . We were travelling as members of an Insight Vacations Group Tour visiting Morocco. Our time at this hotel in Marrakesh and subsequent enjoyment of our tour, was ruined by the incompetence, irresponsibility and totally unprofessional attitude of the management and staff of this hotel . Not only did the porters fail to deliver my husband’s suitcase to our room after our arrival , the management there denied receiving it and blamed the company we were travelling with for its disappearance . Mr. Badr who was in charge of porterage , was most unhelpful , and hours after the suitcase went missing , having been given a full description…"
 June 2019,2,Awful Service,"Stayed here the weekend of the 7-06-19 for 3 nights. I’ll list the things as I seen them. Check in: Basically very poor levels of service, the 2 x people on reception didn’t understand English, yes I know I’m in a foreign country but I have never had an issue in any other country in 5 star hotels. We eventually got told at 10:00 am no room was available till at least 14:00 we had no problem with that but at 14:00 was told still no room, what seemed to be a senior staff member who could actually understand English then got involved and got us our room. The first experience of a couldn’t care less attitude. They then gave us a cheap photo copy piece of paper which was meant to be a map and drew 2 circles 1 which I believe was reception and the other was where our room was. No…"
 June 2019,4,Holiday,"Would be 5 star review except for the Internet being on and off at times. Great breakfast and nice rooms. Lovely pool and big stand out was Hassan, a super friendly and helpful lifeguard who guided us on the best places to go. I have nicknamed him Hassan the Hassel Hoff, dark hair and big muscles lol."
 April 2019,4,Nice,This hotel was nice and very modern. I stayed in the King suite with my hubby and baby and must say enjoyed it. The bathroom was nice and big with his and hers sink. The balcony was lovely to sit out and chill. There was an issue with the kettle not working. This was a nightmare as I couldn't make up my babies bottles. The staff were very reluctant to give a new kettle until right at the end when they realised after 6 attempts the one we had was broken! Nevertheless. Despite this everything else was pleasant. The suites are a bit out from the other rooms but it is quiet and no one disturbing you. The strange thing about the suite is not having many plug sockets. They were either used for the kettles etc or on the skirting board which meant my UK adapter couldn't fit…
 June 2019,2,Bad service,The hotel is nice and is in a beaituful location. But the service is quite avarage. We had dinner with> 10 people . There was not enough number of waiters. They forgot and missed some orders. The requested iron to the room. I called the room service 4 times it took them 4 hours to brung. I ordered a hard pillow and called 2 times. No response still waiting for it. Quite expensive and not good value for the money...
 June 2019,3,Room,"+Very Nice staff +Clean and spacious lobby + comfy beds - bad smell in WC in room - there were some small dirts, for example on pic - restaurant should have better food Location: kinda far for those who wants to explore real Marrakech From my point of view this hotel is kind of “all inclusive” hotel which is bad for those who wants to really take a rest not in a crowded swimming pols"
 February 2019,5,Excellent hotel in a nice neighbourhood,"Stayed at this property for 2 nights with gate 1 travel .Beautiful hotel with different wings.Great decoration, Very fresh and comfortable rooms.Great buffet breakfast and great onsight restaurants offering local and int'l deicasies. Only complaint is all lobby, restaurant and room furnıture are very low making it impossible for elderly and disabled people to get up once seated. It is impossible . Normal height dinning room chairs and couches etc. should be provided. NOT EVERYONE IS 18 YEARS OLD......"
 May 2019,5,Plush is This Hotel's Middle Name,"While visiting Marrakesh we stayed two nights at the Movenpick Hotel. We would have preferred to stay a month. This is a great hotel and the staff is incredibly cordial. What a treat! The rooms are very comfortable as are the beds. A refrigerator, safe, wifi and coffee (with a heater) are provided. Plush robes and slippers are also provided. The biggest criticism about this property is that it is very large and you can easily get lost. The friendly staff can quickly get you going in the right direction. Food at the restaurant is excellent and sitting by the pool having breakfast makes the entire experience perfect. Dinner by the pool was an equally enjoyable experience. You will not go wrong staying at this hotel."
 May 2019,4,A pleasant stay...,"Our stay at the hotel was pleasant, and this hotel was beautiful! The centre piece lighting, and the various forms of art work were mesmerising. Pro: The majority of the staff were friendly and approachable Pro: the hotel itself was very clean and kept at a high standard Pro: the range of facilities at the hotel were good, such as the spa and swimming pool! Pro: the hotel was also located in a convenient area! There was a mall just up the road, the Medina was a ten minute drive away. The main attractions such as Jardin Majorelle, Le Jardin Secret, the Saadian Tombs and the Bahia Palace were approx a 10 minute drive away! Pro: the restaurant provided a good range of food from, starters to desserts! The deserts were notably the highlight of my dining experience at the…"
 May 2019,2,"Hotel grounds nice, service is poor","The lobby and grounds of the hotel are nice. They are visually pleasing and have a nice smell. Staff is not helpful. I booked 2 day tours with the hotel and the actual experience was very different than what was promised. The waiters at the restaurant are slow to serve you. I got up during my meal to get something from the buffet and when I came back my drink is gone. When I asked them about it, they said I had finished it and would have to purchase another one, even though I know it was not finished. i had to call housekeeping 3 times to request a simple bed sheet. They repeatedly told me they would bring it but they never did. Poor service at this place. Save yourself the aggravation. Book your stay somewhere else."
 May 2019,4,Lovely hotel,"I stayed 5 nights at the Movenpick Hotel and I couldn’t fault it. I booked a transfer via email, got a swift reply and on the day they were waiting upon my arrival. My room was spacious and lovely, maybe a little tired in places but you’d only notice if you were really looking. I used the gym, and it was very well equipped. I also booked a few massages in advance via email with Bouchra in reception. She was very helpful and responded to my emails quickly. I met her each day and she was very warm and welcoming, it was lovely to meet her in person. I had 3 different therapists each time Fatin, Khadija and Bouchra - they were all very professional, made me feel at ease and the massages were excellent. The spa was very calming and I’d recommend a visit. I had breakfast and dinner at…"
 March 2019,5,Beautiful!,"Beautiful lobby!! Beautiful rooms. Heated pool, kids pool, mini pool. Great breakfast! Great service at the restaurants (££££). Everything was great...we made my parents go the month after to the same hotel :)"
 May 2019,5,Excellent hotel!,"As soon as we walked into this hotel, with its gorgeous lobby, we felt great about choosing to stay here! The hotel lobby is stunning, and the rest of the property, pool, etc. are equally grand. We were also very satisfied with our room, with its black marble bathroom and luxe linens. The staff was very helpful, providing change for our larger denominated bills. The breakfast buffet is incredible - extensive and delicious. We ate dinner at 54 Steak. The ribeye was cooked to perfection. Service was superb. We also ate at Dada's Diner, which was a nice option for quick, casual meal. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
 May 2019,5,Breakfast,"My husband and I came chose this hotel for our mini vacation plus other things. The hotel is gorgeous and the views are breathtaking. The staff are respectful, friendly, welcome and are willing to go above and beyond to help. Breakfast is free and naima and Mohammed were always there to help us. Naima especially was always there to recommend things and chat with us. I surely fell like I was at home. I would recommend this hotel to.lots of people. I will definitely comme back again in the near future 🤗🤗🤗."
 May 2019,1,Not a five stars hotel ! Poor service quality and food,No welcome drink No recharge of toilet paper in the room Bar of the swimming pool closes more than one hour before the sunset and even 15 minutes before they do not take anymore any order Not enough umbrellas in the swimming pool and when we ask they just say « bad luck for you » Terrible food at the night buffet and very expensive (but breakfast is OK) Issue with the final bill (charged some beverages that we did not take) Very poor quality of service at the swimming pool (take 45 minutes to bring a diet coke) Clearly not a five stars hotel !! Maximum a two or three stars hotel... very disappointed by these vacation !!!!
 May 2019,3,Definitely not a five star hotel,"We are on day 3 of a four night stay and would like to share our feedback to assist anyone else considering this hotel. We arrived on Saturday after a long journey and were not given the rooms we had booked. My daughter and I are sharing a double bed and our friends are in tiny single beds next door. We were not provided with any refreshments on Check in (despite previous reviewers receiving this service) After checking in we were guided to our basic room in a worn out building with no mini bar, no iron, no hairdryer and no WiFi ! The tea and coffee in the room is not replaced once you have used the two sachets provided and there is no turn down service in the evening. Breakfast is very basic and on our second day we were not even offered any drinks from the lady serving…"
 May 2019,4,Short break.,"Just a short break. 3.5hr from Stanstead. Hotel is lovely. It’s quiet so don’t expect entertainment or shows. On the whole it’s top quality but is a little tired in places. Rooms are simple & comfortable but not opulent. Breakfast was basic but dinner is excellent. The venue is made that bit better by its excellent staff in particular, Naima in the breakfast room ... nothing was too much trouble for her (she should get employee of the year!)."
 May 2019,5,Concierge made it extra special,I wanted to say I was very impressed with the birthday cake I requested for my partner. He was visiting Marrakesh solo for his birthday. The concierge team arranged a cake on his arrival as well as on his actual birthday a few days later!! He loved it and will bring some back for me. Special thank you to Amine who handled my emails. Zahra
 April 2019,4,Nice hotel and friendly staff,We stayed four night in the Mövenpick and we really enjoyed our stay. Despite having more than 500 rooms the hotel is well designed and doesnt tell over crowded. The staff is really welcoming and professional and the bedroom are correct.
 April 2019,4,Funky Hotel,"I was in town for work and stayed for 3 nights. I found the hotel to be clean, to have good service and the interiors to be very colorful and hip. The gym had quite a lot of machinery and the food was great. i would stay again"
 April 2019,3,Okay,"My recent stay here was ok but not as great as I thought it would be. On arrival the lobby is grand with huge sliding doors and we received snacks while we were being checked in. Lovely! However, after the walk past the stunning pool area on the way to my room, my expectations took a hit. The elevator was rockery and frankly very tired with faded and patchy carpet. The room was just ok with no iron in the room (had to call the front desk for that) and a shaky toilet. When I turned on the air conditioning in the room, it was so noisy. On the positive side the breakfast is good with many choices and the restaurant by the pool has excellent food. The pizza and burgers were delicious and the bunnies hopping around were a fun, eclectic touch. In addition, the staff is very…"
 May 2019,5,fabulous stay at the movenpick,"my friend and I stayed 7 nights at the Movenpick in a junior suite, great size room, very comfortable beds, linens, very clean, large terrace with full sitting area and a table for 4. Housekeeping staff very attentive and accommodating to all our demands. the only issue with the room is that windows in the bedroom does not open, it can get a bit warm, but living room area has a slide door you can get lovely brezze at night, but it does not reach the bedroom. spa is fabulous with great prices for treatments, Hammam and massages were fabulous. Great buffet breakfast includes freshly made Moroccan pancakes and mint tea ceremony . ample space in pool area, it can get crowded. The highlight was the concierge staff Amine and specially Safae, went above and beyond with their…"
 May 2019,3,Good but not five star,"We travelled for a short break from the UK for our dads 60th. No real effort was made for the fact it’s his birthday. Which is fine but we have stayed in lots of five star hotels that have made a big effort out of no real special birthdays. The staff are lovely. Work so hard and really nice and caring especially the waiters in the evening. They recommended such nice food and wine for us which we appreciated over just telling us to get stuff for the sake of it. We only got to spend one full day at the hotel as we did an amazing private tour on one of the days, recommended by the hotel, he was honestly such a good tour guide, made our trip to be honest. On this one day we , obviously, wanted to sit by the pool. The sun beds are limited , not the fault of the staff and they try…"
 October 2018,4,Awesome place to stay with the most amazing staff and breakfast!!!,"I accompanied my husband on a business trip as the company he represents also organizes a spouse program with visits and activities which allows to discover the place pretty well. When we first arrived at the hotel, we were amazed to see the staff outside greeting us as we got off the bus. We were even more amazed once we entered the hotel which is not only beautiful but had the most sumptuous flower arrangements, all over!! We were of course greeted with typical tea and sweets which you tend to have about 10 times a day in Morocco as it is DELICIOUS!!! FYI, if you wish to purchase their tea, do so in the Souq or at the mall, don’t wait for the airport, you won’t find the kind they serve in the city. We were escorted to our rooms in one of the blocks closer to the pool so we…"
 April 2019,4,"Great, big, well run hotel","After travelling through Morocco, mountains, desert and all, we chose this place for a few days of relaxation before heading back home. Very good choice it was. The hotel already stuns you with one of the nicest and impressive lobbies ever.You can immediately feel it is nicely run. It is a big establishment (seven buildings?). We got rooms in one of the farther ones, which felt more like a serviced apartment, so spacious it was. Everything seems quite new and very well taken care of (cleanliness, landscaping, etc.). The pool area is nice, and on nice days the number of sunbeds seems limited. Might need to go early. The pool bar is great, has some dishes for a quick lunch break. The gym and SPA are also well equipped and the staff very helpful. The breakfast area somehow feels…"
 April 2019,4,DJ,"The Dj yassin is one the of best around, full of energy and excitement and it was the best part of the experience for me. The overall hotel experience was pretty awesome. I would definitive reccomand it."
 April 2019,3,"Good hotel, but ...","This hotel is lovely. My room is spacious, clean and comfortable. Hotel amenities are great - good breakfast, beautiful pool, lovely staff. Why is there always a “but”? Yesterday after my room was cleaned, I had no hand-towel or bottled water. Having only been here for one night so far, I asked at reception if water was supposed to be replenished daily. Yes was the answer. Also my kettle didn’t work. I had to ask at reception 3 times before I received a working kettle, a hand-towel and a bottle of water. Today my room has been serviced and, at 3.50 pm, I have absolutely no towels at all and my used coffee cups have not been cleaned. Maybe it is retribution for asking 3 times yesterday! I have already dried my hands on a bathrobe and have phoned guest services to…"
 April 2019,5,"Very clean, comfortable hotel in good location","The hotel has a beautiful pool area and a large choice of restaurants. The room was large, clean and the mattress was finally (after many hotels in Morocco), comfortable. The shower was also the best we experienced, however, ours was not pitched correctly and kept flooding the floor. The breakfast buffet was very good with flaky pastries. Service was attentive and the staff would walk with you to show you where to go. The location is on a main road which was pleasant to walk on and see the train station and royal theatre. We walked back from the souk, very pleasant, but not short."
 April 2019,5,Holiday,My sister has reviewed already but I would like to echo her comments Anas and Jihane who work at the lovely pool at the movenpick are a fantastic asset to the holiday experience nothing is too much trouble for them We certainly will be back time and time again
 April 2019,5,Holiday with Sister,"This is our 3rd visit to the Movenpick and it won't be our last. The main amenities we used this trip was the pool area. The beds are so comfortable, very easy to rest and enjoy the sunshine. The life guard Anas is an absolute treasure and as always looked after all the guests superbly. Anas remembered us by name after our last visit in July and the time before that in September 2017. We were also very pleased to see that Jihane the pool waiter was still working at the hotel. She is by fair the most attentive member of the team there. She is always watching and checking that the guests have everything they need and when delivering food she lays it all out neatly to ensure the guest has the best experience. The customer service demonstrated by Anas and Jihane is 2nd to…"
 April 2019,4,Good place to stay for short vacation,"The ambiance and decor of the common areas is worth a look. The rooms,though neat and clean, are however a letdown. The service and housekeeping is poor. The property has a number of excellent swimming pools , which are the main attraction during summer months."
 April 2019,1,Nasty,"Clearly, the toilet has not been scrubbed properly. I am so grossed out. The vanity had hair on it. There are marks & stains on the walls. There are stains on the carpet. The lobby has a nauseating overpowering gardenia smell. I think this is common in Morocco. It’s like the old lady with too much perfume on to cover up bodily smells."
 April 2019,4,Great place,We stayed in for the first few days of our tour. The staff was very helpful. The room was spacious and well equipped. The bar was well staffed. We ate at the restaurant and found the food tasty. The decor in the lobby was very eclectic. It was a 30 dirham ride to the souk. This hotel is located I. The new part of the city. I would stay here again.
 November 2018,5,Very Beautifull Hotel,Splendid and Grandeuse hotel . Enormous complex of hotel with convention center . Curated with amazing art and award winning restaurant . Room is spotless and swimming pool is heated . Surrounded by lush garden and fountain.
 March 2019,5,Wonderful Hotel,"Wow, this place is incredible, from walking through the main doors, this hotel definitely exceeded expectations. The room was good, we got upgraded, but downfall the rooms were so far from main entrance and back entrance near us had been closed off. Service was overall great, the only one thing was we were after specific Teas, and called room service about 5 times, after waiting for 3 hours we headed to the bar ourselves to request this. We felt we were right on the edge so it was nice and quiet and had our privacy. Breaksfast was great but super busy! Pool and amneties were fab, the restaurant manager was brilliant too, we really felt taken care of (3 girls) even thought the small tea issue. Lovely hotel, would come back."
 April 2019,5,"Great hotel, Friendly staff,","Friendly staff, nice poolside. The setting is very luxurious and it caters to the comfort of of the guests. My room was well appointed with all the usual amenities. Excellent buffet breakfast. We would highly recommend this hotel!"
 April 2019,3,The good and the bad,"The only true way to review this gigantic resort style hotel is to put the food of it against the bad... The Good: -Architecturally beautiful -Modern services and construction -Nice sized rooms (but not enormous) -Art exhibits around the lobby area -Several restaurants to chose from -Several pools, one of them quite large. -Nice plant and flower filled grounds. -Centrally located -Nice breakfast buffet -Free wifi -Kids club The Bad: -Room was infested with ants; housekeeping never did anything about it -Our hair dryer caught fire after starting it, the hotel change it after 24 hours and several requests at the front desk -Although there are several restaurants they share many menu intend throughout -Service at restaurants can be either efficient or extremely slow…"
 April 2019,1,Worst “5 star” hotel i have ever stayed at. Service and food quality is of the lowest possible.,"I seldom do reviews - but after spending 5000 eur on this nightmare it deserved one. lets start with the positive - IF you buy a 600 eur per night suite - rooms are relatively large / clean - and in generel all people are friendly and breakfast is decent. But - Forget any pictures you see on their website - was probably taken in 1999. after 2 hour wait in reception upon arrival as rooms were not finished on check in time - without any offer fro water or any other gesture - we recieved one room out of the 2- well after asking 5 times in reception whats going on as no one comes to you to assist. In insane amount of groups and package tours are slamming check in so you can get an extreme wait in generel at reception area. After 4 calls to reception and another 1,5 hour wait from…"
 April 2019,5,Amazing!!,"Amazing hotel... best location in marrakech, near to all activities (night clubs, malls, markets). staff super helpful. Big thanks to Bouchra from standard who was very helping with all my requests. To recommand !!!"
 March 2019,5,Hen Party,Has the most amazing stay at Movenpick Hotel as a mini hen break with my sisters. The grounds were stunning. We were upgraded to a suit which was also absolutely stunning. The staff were so helpful and very polite. A big thank you to Jaouad Ed-Dajjany who was the manager for the restaurant and his staff for the hospitality and making sure we were well looked after throughout the evening. Would definitely make a return trip!
 February 2019,5,Excellent,"Beautiful hotel, amazing service and sites. Not the prime location in the city, but far from being bad. Nice breakfast buffet in a nice setting. The hotel hosts an art gallery, but is has great art prices throughout the property."
 April 2019,5,Super family Hotel in Marrakech,"Nicely located not too far from the Medina, about 60 to 70 D depending on how you manage your negotiations. The taxis have nothing to do with the Hotel so the latter not to blame if you get caught out. Stayed with 2 adults 2 kids in a small suite perfect for our needs. Staff welcoming and super friendly, big thanks to housekeeping team. Breakfast a bit chaotic from 9 to 10 better before and after. Waiters under pressure to keep up supply of knives and forks and napkins. Good breakfast selection, not the best we have seen in a 5 star but good all the same, thumbs up to the omelette , and traditional Moroccan pancake teams. Other on site food options a bit limited really. Pool side by day – best to eat in the restaurant at the back of the pool sun bed service hit and…"
 April 2019,4,Crazy Mommas review.... of Movenpick Hotel...Excellent accommodation in nice location,"The Movenpick Hotel is set in beautiful surroundings. Has amazing art & gallery. We were in a-garden room 4010 with small terrace having been up graded because of problems with our accommodation when we first arrived. Receptionists very helpful kind and patient Thank you Afaf & Hind on reception. All the staff were extremely nice nothing was to much trouble the waiters Mouchine & Brahim in the Saray restaurant especially so. And also Warrda our room maid such a lovely attitude It’s a top class hotel and a great place to escape the manic traffic , hussel and bussel that is Marrakesh . Things to be aware of taxi drivers over charge & drop you off to waiting guides. Be careful when taking photos or you will have to pay. There is constant pressure to give... The Medinas & Souks…"
 March 2019,4,Lovely large hotel on the outskirts of town,Loved our stay out of season. Plenty of space and good service. Evenings by the pool as the sun set while drinking cocktails before good food in the hotel choice of restaurants was a highlight. Would definitely consider staying there again
 April 2019,1,Disappointed,Unfortunately our stay at Movenpick wasn’t great! Started off with the staff at the front desk taking ages to even assist us (even though they were available). The room was clean but we didn’t receive the Cot bed as requested. Service was very slow an any request had to be made two/three times before it was done. Staff for breakfast were extremely rude an inattentive. No cutlery or napkins most mornings. Coffee wasn’t great! Disappointed with the service at this hotel. Won’t be staying here again.
 April 2019,1,Very Loud disco noise outside room,"If you are looking for relaxation don't go here, unless you check if they are having an event outside in the courtyard area, with very loud music, which they do, and they know when time it is going to end, which they don't, when asked twice. They need to decide if they are an outdoor event space, or a hotel."
 April 2019,3,Movenpick,"I'm the customer of hotel movenpick I had stayed for 1week I really like the hotel location there is a nice view on the garden also I like the pool but the should some DJ music in the pool for people to have fun to to pass there time ,and even o would like tell you there is really bad service in the spa I didn't like it at all ,there is no changes in the food it's very poor the rooms it really very simple but the mades who that they really have a good service I would like to thank ouaicha khadija she is really amazing women and ait warker najat mdme hilal they are excellent people they know how to talk to people ,the hotel it's not perfect thank you I hope you change this things other wise the other the hotel gonna be so bad"
 April 2019,5,Beautiful Property,"Stayed here for 3 nights and booked 2 classic rooms. One of the rooms got up graded to a junior suite. Anyhow we loved both the room and the suite. The only setback was these rooms are far apart as ours was in front of the main pool whilst our children were in the suite block at the end of the property. Breakfast and dinner were both great. Good food with loads of choices. The location is also good as you can easily walk to Menara Mall in 15 minutes being maximum. It is a huge property as there’s a convention centre next to this hotel. Staff are great too! Plenty of facilities to choose from - Hamam, Spa, more than 1 swimming pools etc."
 April 2019,5,Beautiful!,"Great location, great facilities and seamless customer service! Thank you for having us! The only one negative was the vegetarian options for food were very very limited during our half board dinner and we ended up eating pretty much the same thing every evening which was a real shame. I can't fault anything else though."
 March 2019,5,"Good Hotel, Good Location, Enjoyable Dining","Stayed here for three nights. Good location, good sized rooms, great pool facilities, nice gardens, had a pleasant feel about it. Dined in on two occasions which is unusual for my wife and I as we usually dine at venues outside our accommodation. The tapas at Marcelona was good though the big screen sport is a bit loud. Buffet breakfast in the Saray Restaurant was probably the best we experienced in Morocco. And Ayoub always got us good coffees to start the day. Location is great with the old medina, supermarkets and other restaurant alternatives within walking distance."
 April 2019,1,Bad housekeping and irrelevant reception,"We have been staying in this hotel for two days, Firstly when we first entered the hotel room the electrical system of the room was not working, we waited for half an hour to be fixed but they did not find it suitable to give another room, There was no water in the room, we were calling for room service, but they did not bring, and the television did not work again, This morning the electricity was cut off again, we called and they said they would come but they did not, Our room number is 7507 and there is still no going in, I have never seen such a bad service that I have traveled to many parts of the world. I don’t recommend to anyone"
 March 2019,5,Truely 5 * worth!,"Super friendly and helpfull staff! Breakfast is super, great variety! Really worth its five stars! Beautiful hotel! Good location, did everything by foot but taxis are all day available in front of hotel."
 March 2019,2,Disappointing stay,"We were so excited to stay at the Movenpick before we left Marrakech. I little bit of lux & relaxation from a the medina before flew back. What a disappointment we had. The 1st floor grounds, lobby, artwork, & general design was beautiful but the service was atrocious. When you enter to check in the staff are not friendly or welcoming. They have a look on their face like you are bothering them. Minimal explanation of the grounds but you are given a half-ass map of the hotel which was barely helpful. We attempted to go to the Marcelona restaurant which was supposed to have Spanish influenced food. Well, don't count on it because they changed their menu & it was Moroccan than Spanish. The hostess did not crack a smile & she told us their was no table for 2 but pointed to the bar…"
 March 2019,5,Definitely five star,"The Movenpick Hotel in Marrakech is a wonderful place. The cavernous and labyrinthine lobby is simply a delightful place in which to get lost and to explore. It really is a worthwhile maze with lots of art work and beautiful and stylistic furniture to experience; and there is always a helpful employee to set you on the correct path should you be in a hurry to find your room, one of its restaurants or a convenient exit. Our room was spacious, clean, comfortable and well-appointed. Complimentary wifi and a bottle of water were appreciated. Breakfast provided a great array of foodstuff from which to choose and with two efficient egg chefs there was little time wasted waiting for your individually prepared omelette or eggs. With the super friendly and helpful staff this is a great…"
 March 2019,5,Great place away from the hustle and bustle...but not to far,"Don't usually stay in large hotels and this is large. However it didn't feel so due to the fabulous service we received whilst staying there from the exceptional staff , from the pool guys who found us sunbeds and towels to the maids who cleaned our room. Special shout out to Brahim in the restaurant who looked after us during breakfast. If you are looking for somewhere to stay and relax after a busy day sightseeing, it's perfect and only £4 in a taxi to the main square so you can come and go as you please, with ease. If you prefer to walk off those fabulous breakfasts it will take you 30mins."
 March 2019,4,Enjoyable stay at Movenpick,We visited Marrakech for one week and stayed at Movenpick. We loved the artwork and graffiti in the hotel! Although the hotel wasn't excellent the service we received from the hotel staff was. We were particularly looked after by Ayoub during all our meals.
 March 2019,5,Great place,Really nice place for a family .we are here the first time and we like the hotel very much .thanks too much all the stuff for being helpful.special thanks for laila marcelona very helpful mi family very happy of the servise layla ..thnk you
 March 2019,5,10/10 AMAZINGGGG,"This place is truly a gem! I went with my sister and cousin, staff, food, atmosphere and rooms are all amazing! Initially we were meant to stay at this hotel and one other, as movenpick didn’t have the availability when we first book for us to stay with them the whole holiday: anyways we stayed here for half our holiday and made our way to the second hotel 3 days later... WHAT A MISTAKE. The other was soo bad we had to return to movenpick. They were actually fully booked because of a Chanel conference but thankfully Nadia managed to find us a room which we were so grateful for because this hotel MADE OUR HOLIDAY ! Special thanks to Hind for sorting all our activities for us and being so lovely to us! This place is a gem and we are looking to come back to Marrakech and stay at…"
 March 2019,5,Nice stay,"The hotel lobby is an art gallery, full of paintings and sculptures. The room was very spacious, bed was comfortable, bathroom clean, there’s a safe, coffee maker and complementary bottle of water. Overall clean room, no complaints."
 March 2019,4,Overall a pleasant stay.,"Good hotel;however, it does need a little updating. The bed mattress not comfortable and dipped causing back pain. Good size bathroom but the toilet area is compact in comparison with rest of the bathroom. The staff are friendly and helpful. Thank you to Warda,young lady, who did a fab job cleaning the rooms everyday with a smile."
 March 2019,1,Deputy Export Director,Very good hotel with special thanks to Mr Mustapha in Sarai Restaurant for his good service and high sens of professionalism. His smile and his concern to satisfy the customer made of him the right person in the right place.
 February 2019,5,Amazing adress,"first of all i would like to thank a young waitress named laila she is very professional , a very nice hotel 😉 the restaurant (Marcelona ) is beautiful and the meal . Thanks for everything Best regards Jean-Yves family"
 March 2019,5,Bachelor Party in Marrakech,"We were a group of 13 friends for a bachelor party and spent 3 nights at the Movenpick. The facilities are great, breakfast is delicious and the staff is amazing. In particular Jihanne who took great care of us at the pool. Thanks a lot to her! Fully recommend to stay there."
 March 2019,4,"Good hotel, helpful staff, very pleasant stay","Obviously mixed experiences here, but we stayed for 4 nights in early March and had a good stay. - no complaints. The main (heated) pool and bar are busy, but the lower (unheated) pool with its bar/restaurant was a calmer spot. Breakfasts are very good, we dined twice in Marcelona restaurant and food was good and reasonably priced. Our standard room was clean, comfortable and well serviced. I agree Reception could be understaffed at times, they do themselves no favours by allowing you to quote any old room number when getting food and drinks, without checks - thus we found a spurious dinner on our bill which took time to sort out. But concierge were swift every day in retrieving our golf bags from storage. We were there during a busy conference in the Palais de Congres next…"
 March 2019,2,Avoid the satellite buildings: no A/C!,"Don’t stay in the satellite buildings! Management refuses to turn on the air conditioning until May. It’s 86 degrees outside and my one bedroom suite is an oven. Even at night or with a breeze blowing through it’s still hot. I heard several other hotel guests complaining about the situation to management, to no avail."
 March 2019,3,Average 5 star hotel. Needs improvement in service level.,"The hotel is huge with rooms spread in many buildings. Of course there is no covered pathway from reception or the restaurant to the buildings housing the rooms and this is a problem when it's raining. Reception is very very small and very slow. Very nice lobby and entrance. Very nice pool area but probably small for the amount of people in the hotel. Gym is not bad though a bit small for a holiday destination huge hotel. The rooms are nicely sized. The bed is nice and comfy. Decor is nice as well. There is tea and coffee facilities but strangely enough only 1 mug. Bathroom is nicely sized with a big shower. Some of the towels were soft and nice, others looked older. Toiletries were refreshed every day. I had a very tiny balcony but as i was ground floor, there is no privacy…"
 March 2019,2,Ruined holiday,"Such a shame i have to post this review, as i was really looking forward to our stay at Movenpick in Marrakech. I loved the design of the hotel, the ambience and trusting the great 5 star service and worldwide reputation i trusted this hotel to enjoy our time off. Booked the superior room for our short 3 day break. We arrived very late at night to the 5* hotel to discover our bathroom and bathtub were full of ants, dirty carpet full of stains and the phone completely not working (our building was very far from reception, about good 5min walk through outdoor area). Don’t get me wrong, the room was beautifully decorated, i loved the design and it was exactly what we wanted, however I expected it to be properly cleaned and prepared for the guests. We had to go a several times to…"
 March 2019,5,Great place,Really nice place for a family stay in Marrakech. We are here second time and we like the hotel very much! Thanks to all of the stuff for being helpfull and kind. Thanks to Jihane working by the pool too!
 March 2019,2,When 5 star rating means nothing,"During our visit recently to Marrakesh we stayed at two different hotels, Four Seasons and Movenpick. Both has the same top rating at for example Booking.com. It is a total joke. Our room in Movenpick was small and smelly. Toilet in bathroom a joke as well, it did not work properly. Pool area absolutely packed with people and difficult to find space."
 March 2019,5,Amazing hotel and best waitress,"The Hotel is super nice and very clean - and the waitress, her Name is Jihane, is the best!! We really appreciate her Service! We are coming back to this Amazing Hotel - Looking forward! See you soon Movenpick"
 March 2019,5,Badr,I had a good time during my work and especially I found your host parents at the reception and at the pool and especially the girl called JIHAN I liked his kindness and his home she is very nice ......
 February 2019,3,Would expect better from a Mövenpick,"The best part of the hotel was it's staff. Especially during the breakfast, even though that it was too many people, they could still find room for our family. The heated pool was great! The rooms had rather good size, loved the spacy bathroom. Comfy bed. On a negative side - the rooms are really outdated. The carpeted floor was very-very dirty, the carpets should be changed immediately. It seemed that even after room service, the floors were not really cleaned, there was still dirt on floors. We had to wear shoes all the time, as otherwise the feet/socks would get dirty. It was nice to have the balcony, but there was almost no view unfortunately. The elevators were a disgrace. The button lights were not working, you could not understand on which floor you were stopping as the…"
 March 2019,5,Fantastic,"My parents and I spent the weekend in this fabulous hotel. The amenities are top notch. Rooms are so confortable, with great quality toiletry. The breakfast is varied, generous and delicious. The staff is fantastic. In particular Mustafa (koukh?) in the restaurant who’s so friendly and attentive. For example we craved some meloui but the lady making them had left. We went inside the kitchen to order some fresh ones for us. Thank you Mustafa and thank you the rest of the staff for a great stay"
 February 2019,5,Great birthday celebration,"We recently discovered this amazing property as a birthday gift for our son. He had always wanted to go to Marrakech and this hotel did not disappoint! From the great care Hanane and Hind took to make my sons birthday special, to Dahjli at the spa, who was amazing! Thank you for making our first trip to Marrakech truly special!"
 February 2019,5,Amazing staff!,"Absolutely thrilled with the service we received! Came for a hen but arrived separately due to pregnancy. Greeted on arrival by lovely team - must point out Laila who was the receptionist who dealt with us, extremely efficient and helpful, even upgraded is. Thank you so much for a great stay!"
 February 2019,5,AMAZING,"To think I had almost missed this gem of a hotel. Upon searching for hotels Movenpick had not come up due to being sold out for part of my stay, but I liked the look of the hotel thus had chosen to atleast for the four days here and elsewhere for the remainder of my holiday and I was not disappointed. Arrival - check in was quick and efficient, our room was ready and the receptionist was very polite. Rooms - very clean, modern, comfy and not dingy looking like a lot of the rooms in other hotels in Marrakech. Bathroom - beautiful, showers were powerful and didnt leak too much like other hotels Breakfast - a lot of choice, fresh paratha and omelettes. Left satisfied everyday. Pool - Amazing, jacuzzi and sauna available too Wifi - Good but sometimes cut off but nothing…"
 February 2019,5,Simply bowled over by this hotel,What an incredible start to our tour of Morocco. It was a spectacular hotel with a lobby floor that stretched into a labyrinth of decorated enclaves and art displays. I think the Feng Shui is good as it has a grand water feature in front and a spacious lobby to let the good vibes in. High backed sofa chairs greet our tired jetlagged bodies_ we had flown for 18 hours and coached from Casablanca International airport upom touchdown. The rooms were so cosy and the beds luxurious. All the toiletries were arghan oil-based.. Although we went down late for dinner to an almost empty buffet we did not mind as we were more tired than hungry. The morning buffet was ample and the omelette chef took the trouble to decorate the plate. The pastries were excellent_ loved the authentic…
 February 2019,5,I would come to this hotel every single I come to Marrakech I don’t want to try anyone else!,"Hands down staying at this hotel was one of the best experience of my life. We arrived in the morning and we was greeted by the most lovely people who helped us move our bags in and more. Leila at the reception (god bless her soul) was the most amazing person to grace this planet, the way she made us feel welcome and greeted us and went the extra mile for everything puting us and our best interest first was just honestly so pleasing and wonderful. In addition, I want to thank Leila for her amazing work at this hotel and she is defiantly someone who really does her job to her best ability and I wish there was more Leilas in the world. I wanted to surprise my partner I decided to upgrade to a suite room from a classic room and now thinking of it was one of the best decisions I…"
 February 2019,5,Extremely professional service,"Me and my partner arrived by taxi at the hotel, where we were received by a helpful young man who took our luggage and lead us to reception. The service was fast and welcoming. We were quickly signed in to our rooms and further details explained. My partner wanted to surprise me and upgrade our room, where we were given a suite with no inconvenience! The rooms are amazing and spacious. The lighting is outstanding and incredible. The views are to die for. And the pools are ever so beautiful. Room service and maintenance is 24/7!! We forgot our adapter and they helped us out with no problem. Overall I love my visit here and hate the thought to leave!! Highly recommend for a perfect gateway, romantic or not, the location is perfect as there’s a mall just by 15 minutes walk.…"
 February 2019,5,Dr. Khaled,"Hotel Lobby was wonderful as a piece of art, didderent receptions distributed arround front office desk every reception reflects a specific stage of Marrakech culture, old African soldiers boat with hot colors and live musician shows all the day with traditional dress and tea as hospitality for audiences Staff are very polite, helpful and descent Restaurant was very clean, providing variety of foods local and western, Desserts very tasty and delicious fresh fruits every day Room was very clean and comfortable. Daily drink water supply, expresso, coffee and tea also renewed every day Heated Pool with different levels Meeting room was huge and well equipped with audio and video instruments Red flowers and very elegant smell everywhere Really it was very good experience"
 February 2019,5,Great service!,Spend two days at the pool and we enjoyed it a lot. Khalid the poolboy is a very happy guy who made our days even more relaxing! I would really recommend buying a day pass which is including a 2-course lunch.
 October 2018,5,Best Hotel,"The Hotel was beautifully designed, in typical Moroccan style, room was quite good. The staffs are helpful and generous. Food and the balcony view were amazing! I highly recommend this hotel to both business and traveling guests."
 February 2019,5,Movenpick manssoue eldahhaby Marrakesh spa,"I would like thank Najia the massage specialist and therapist in movinpuck manssour el dahabe marrakesh spa ,as she is the best in the world , really i have made many massage seesion all around the world ( malasia, hurgada, turky , barcelona) but no one lika NAjia ,U fully recomnend her for any one who visit Morroco or Marrakesh even if you not a movenpick guest she is the best ever seen regarding all types of madassagee"
 December 2018,3,Not to impressed,The hotel is beautiful. The lobby is impressive. The rooms are big. The spa is not too impressive. The service lack in some areas. I was charged twice however I already paid and once I told them I paid they still charged me.. The kids club lacks of activity done outside the club. My girls 5 and 6 sears old found it too boring. However they offer free lunch for children. The swimming pool area is very nice however even if heated the swimming pool in December was too cold. The restaurant service is not the best. Extreme long wait even if only 2 tables were busy and the waitress were very moody. We arrive to the hotel with a rented car and they couldn't find the car when we were leaving. Overall it is a nice hotel but I was not impressed with the service.
 February 2019,4,Very nice hotel- very good staff/services,"I spent a couples days there for work and I hope I will have the opportunity to go to this hotel again!! Very nice, well decorated, quite, huge outside (heated) pool, lot of choises for breakfast and a pretty good fitness area. Everyday there's a coach to help you with your work out session. Mohammed Amin gave a 30 min work-out and or felt like working out for 1 hour 😅 . Very good coach, advises and exercises!!"
 February 2019,5,Dinner,"Such a nice service, actually it was expected because this is not the first time. I've been here in a lot of events and they are always surprising me with their prestigious service. Food is nice. Music and lights are fabulous."
 January 2019,5,"Amazingly elegant and excellent staff, very comfy bedding","Spacious and beautifully well designed areas, elegant reception and very helpful staff. Rooms are spacious, finely decorated and clean. We had fresh flowers every day and the bedding was the best! This trip was planned for my birthday, and the staff noted this event. When we came back to the hotel the nigh of my birthday, they surprised us with our room decorated with rose petals everywhere and a delicious chocolate cake waiting for us in the stay room. Thanks for making me so happy!"
 January 2019,5,Amazing hotel and staff,"We stayed for a week in Mövenpick hotel, absoluloved every mintute of our stay, very polite and helpful staff. My daughter had a best time of her life. I can’t thanks enough Turin and Basma for looking after and playing with my daughter. They baked, danced and played all day. Would definitely recommend the hotel, specially the kids club, you can leave your child with them with a peace of mind that they are in a safe hands."
 December 2018,2,Sad experience - stay away !,"This is not a five star hotel as you know it. It's nice arrival, but I get a feeling that they don't have control. The room is big but dirty. There is a large dark oil stain on the carpet floor and everything is worn. The mini bar is empty and there is a kettle for coffee, but there is only dry milk left in the box. The internet is incredibly slow and I had to give up checking the news. On several occasions the reception does not respond when you call. I guess my expectations were bigger, but this is just sad and not worth five flat ears. The surroundings are nice and the breakfast was relatively good selection. But there were so many people, but it was included which is always nice. If you are staying here, I advise you to curb your expectations. The pizza at the pool was…"
 December 2018,4,Great Hotel,Great Hotel and location in the heart of the city.Rooms were large and clean. The grounds of the hotel are stunning from the lobbies to the pools and the spa was beautiful with reasonably priced and good services. Food at the pool and room service both pretty good. Breakfast was very extensive and nice. The staff at the front desk is great especially Hind. A little bit high rate but still looking forward for my next stay.
 January 2019,5,Yoga classes,I was pleased to finally being able to find a heaven spot in Marrakech to practice yoga. OM YOGA studio is definetly the place to be and it's located in Movenpick Marrakech. You are loaded with positive vibes as soon as you step in by meeting the gorgeous Morad!I had the greatest introduction to all the facilities and full explanation about their offer. This guy is a jewel in this studio and I am happy to meet such high standard service in Morocco.
 January 2019,5,Mr &Mrs,"We had a wonderful time in Marrakech, our hotel was very convenient and clean. We were impressed with the guidance of your staff ( especially Hind and Afaf ) they helped us to choose the best tours and outings of the hotel. We now look forward to seeing Marrakech again and MOVENPICK hotel in the next coming opportunity, thank you very much Dariush and Mahnaz Mobasheri"
 January 2019,4,Come to eat here.,This is a pleasant hotel with beautiful exterior and nice interiors. We liked it for their restaurant. Very good Moroccan cooking. And in the afternoon a perfect dessert place with great European style pastries and cakes .
 July 2018,3,Pretty from the outside but not so great inside.,"This hotel was chosen by our tour operators. The maze of hallways to get to the lifts was very confusing, and then once in the lifts, you realised that everything was only dressing. The lifts were antiquated and dodgy. Airconditioning in the room did not work well, and we were there in July, and they allegedly had someone ""fix"" it but they didn't have any success. The breakfasts, however, were magnificent, and they had a waiter preparing freshly squeezed orange juice for all. The pool was also lovely for a nice dip to refresh. Certainly could have improved some of the help at desks, as there were receiption, concierge, and other desks located in strange places throughout the maze like lobby."
 January 2019,5,Fantastic Gym Instructor,"During my trip to the Movenpick, I was eager to hit the gym during my stay. On entering the gym I was met by Mohammed Amin, the in house gym instructor. I would highly recommend Mohammed Amin as a personal trainer, having trained with him over a couple of days in January. He has a friendly nature coupled with a real focus on training and will certainly help you achieve your goals."
 January 2019,5,Gym instructor,"Mohamed Amin is really 1 of the best coach here. Friendly, approachable and definitely professional. He gave me advises based on my requirement and certainly did impress me with his knowledge. Give it a shot and you will understand"
 January 2019,5,Great hotel,"I was there with family in january 2019. Wonderful hotel, huge and delicious breakfast, comfy rooms. I would like to specially thank Mohammed Amine, the fitness center coach, who made his best at all times with our big group of 17 persons! He is a very experienced, polite and helpful person who cared a lot about every guest in the fitness centre! And speaks perfectly english, what is not common there! Thank you, Mohammed!"
 January 2019,3,Family 4 day break,Used Movenpick for the first time And the first day at the hotel was a real disappointment the TV wasn’t working and had issues with kettle aswell as the iron. Every time I called room service no one would come and at one stage the electric tripped and I had no electrics and was sat In darkness and was getting ready to go out for a evening meal for my wife’s birthday. I made reception aware of this and eventually some body came up and fixed it. Hour later electric tripped again and I found my self fixing it myself as I knew where the electric box was not something you would find yourself having to do on holiday. The rest of the staff and in the restaurant were lovely and that’s my main reason for scoring the hotel average score. Yusuf/Jo was superb through out my stay the…
 January 2019,4,Hotel with atmosphere,The entrance is very impressive. Rooms are spacious and the balcony offered a great view over the swimming pool. Food is very good and varied. Staff is friendly & professional. The hotel could do with an update as wear & tear is clearly visible. Recommended!
 January 2019,5,Marcelona,"Very pleasant atmosphere in Marcelona restaurant, enjoyed good paella and desserts, can recommend red Marrocan wine Eclipse, very good staff and special thanks to Diego and Khadija who made our two dinners there very enjoyable!"
 December 2018,2,Check your bill -1000euros fraud,"When checking out, we found on the bill almost 1000 euros added extra. One extra night was charged despite the fact that the full holidays were already paid, bills from the restaurant that did not belong to us were charged without our signature, the New Year dinner was charged twice and our credit card was biulled without our authorisation. The programme announced for the New Year dinner was a complete lie and almost nothing was respected starting with the duration of the party and ending with the programme itself. All above was consideredd by the hotel staff as an error!!!! Several errors amounting to 1000 euros. All attempts to have qualified responses failed. We intend to address the competent authorities in Maroc for serious fraud. There is no good choice for having a…"
 January 2019,5,Very good!,"We stayed at the hotel in early January. We had a bigger one in the building opposite the spa. We have been very pleased with the treatment from the hotel. We trained and used their spa daily. I want to thank a person named Abdel Rahman who works at the gym. He was there and helped us with the training in the mornings and his genius, commitment and his personality was super. We are glad we met him. Hopefully we will come back in sha Allah."
 January 2019,5,Fantastic staff,"I stayed here for 10days over New Years with my family. The staff are fantastic and are the reason I give it 5 stars. They are friendly, helpful and just really nice people (as all Moroccan’s we met were). They consistently went out of their way to make our holiday relaxing and enjoyable. In particular the staff around pool with special mention for Anas and Amine. The staff in the kids club were also very good and our 3 children enjoyed going there for a couple of hours each day, giving us sometime to relax. The cleaners did a great job with the room beautifully made up and spotless every day. Only issue I had with the hotel was the lack of information on the hotel and Marrakech in the rooms. There is no guest directory or room service menu in the room (a menu was dropped to…"
 January 2019,5,Great and Amazing!!!,"We moved to this hotel after a bit so good experience at Four Seasons Marrakech. I loved the whole ambience of the hotel, it has everything you need for a good price. The staff where super friendly and professional at the same time. Ibitisam at breakfast enthusiastically designed our plates with beautiful Moroccan art. They bedspreads and restrooms were very clean. It was a bit chilly this January so glad the pool was heated. They however need to upgrade the twin beds, not so comfortable."
 December 2018,5,A wonderful hotel with an efficient and friendly staff!,"We spent 4 nights in this hotel during the Christmas holidays and enjoyed our stay for many reasons, and in particular for the location, the ambiance of the hotel and its amazing staff and facilities. We could swim in the large and warm swimming pool, had relaxing massages in the beautiful spa, and we had excellent lunches and dinners in the various restaurants. The staff advised us on many activities to do in Marrakech and areas to visit. I really recommend this hotel to discover this city and spend relaxing holidays."
 October 2018,3,Just Didn’t care,"Whilst on the whole this hotel has a great location, good facilities the staff let it down. I stayed there for 4 nights and it always felt like I was an inconvenience to the team there. Food quality very good and outdoor pool stunning. I placed a shirt in for dry cleaning one morning to where that evening, but the shirt never made it back, even by the next day no shirt. The hotel couldn’t care less that they had lost a brand New shirt."
 December 2018,3,A really nice hotel... 20 years ago,"The Movenpick Marrakech is a very large hotel with hundreds of rooms. When you arrive, the lobby is quite impressive, but depending on where your room is, it is quite a walk to the room. Our room itself was ok. The room had had some superficial renovation (new carpets, wooden trims, paint etc). The bathroom however was original. The (separate) toilet needed replacing. Indeed, the porcelain had cracks and there was scale which had built up over the last 20 or so years which was not befitting the rest of the room. The common areas of the hotel need more than some basic TLC. The lifts are slow, damaged and unpredictable. They need to be replaced. The paint in the hallways was scuffed and needs re-painting. The breakfast restaurant too had seen better days. In the scheme of…"
 January 2019,5,Beautiful experience!!,"I Was in this hotel for the christmas holiday with my family, and it was a very nice exeperience... hotel beautiful and very comfortable! ...We’d like to say many thanks to HIND, the receptionist that organize us two incredible excursions! Hope to be in this hotel in a future! RACCOMENDED A LOT!!"
 January 2019,5,Mohammed Amin Personal Trainer,"Mohammed Amin is the best personal trainer I’ve met so far. Motivative, energetic and humorous to work with. Also learnt several new techniques and how to focus on specific muscle groups. Real talented guy and he knows what he’s doing. Hope to meet him again and gather some more experience to take home! Definitely deserves 5/5."
 December 2018,3,Poor service bar some great individuals,"The hotels accommodation is top class. The facilities like spa and gym were excellent, the decor is often beautiful, rooms are basic but they’re neat and tidy - I can’t ask for more, basically. Moreover, the location is excellent: 5-10 mins drive to airport, and a 5-10 mins walk to train station and shopping mall (which includes McDonalds and KFC for those who can’t hack the Moroccan cuisine) My only problem is the service. Any complaints u have with the room, don’t expect them to sort it out. I had a lizard crawl into my room. Called the staff 4 times, after 2 hours nobody came and I had to sort it out myself. If u get locked out from your room, don’t expect them to help you. There is no urgency at that hotel, and even more worrying there is no sense of responsibility. From…"
 December 2018,1,New Years Dinner Buffet,"I have stayed at this hotel before and so while on my business trip with my business partner Jaouad, I suggested we go to the hotel’s New Years Eve buffet dinner. The advertisement for the dinner buffet suggested we call to make a reservation which my partner did, and was told that a reservation was not required. So of course we showed up for dinner...and guess what we are told we need a reservation. My partner called back the reservation number we had called earlier in the day while in the hotel restaurant entrance and requested to speak with management. Anyway, nothing was done to rectify the situation. The sad part was that we are in the tourism business here in Morocco and was planning to book our future clients here.

 December 2018,3,A pleasant stay,"Ok...on first impressions the hotel looks nice, it was clean and looked impressive. In the colder weather the main pool is cold!!..even tho is “supposedly” heated to 25-26 degrees...u are shivering, this was one of the reasons I’d choosen this hotel as my son likes to swim in the pools but I greatly disappointed I think he managed 10 minutes on the entirety of our 4 day stay! The bar located next to the pool was terrible at customer service, you can sit there no-one comes over..the staff were always miserable and moody especially the older men working there...they were the same mood it seemed afternoon or evening!! they could do with some lessons is hospitalility. We had a superior room, these rooms are located at the back of the building (a little walk tbh) the room however…"
 December 2018,5,I’m staying at this hotel next time I visit Marrakesh...,"This is a gorgeous hotel, I had a wonderful time. Nice and clean rooms and the staff who went out of there way to make my stay feel like home. The front desk agent Souhail was very accommodating, helpful and excellent. Next door to the Convention Center (Palais des Congrès), close to downtown Marrakesh, train station and restaurants... place to be!!!"
 December 2018,3,Sick place,I'll never forget this place. Beautiful and all that but when i needed their simple service when i was ill they didnt help at all. I called for an urgent wheelchair 3 times when i was rushed to hospital no one acted.
 December 2018,5,Exactly the experience we expect,"Amazing stay at the Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech. Weather was great - sunny, warm enough to sun bathe and swim. Staff were amazing - especially anas at pool who were hugely attentive and helpful. restaurants and Bar and a Spa will satisfy all your needs. room our room located in masouda building was clean with amazing amenities , special thanks for the room made Soukaina for its turndown service and for its beautiful smile .Also a complete gym with ultra modern cardio machines. Highly recommended!"
 December 2018,5,Great Stay,Great stay at Movenpick Marrekech. The staff were really really nice and welcoming. I particularly enjoyed the spa and fitness area. I did a series of deep tissue mssages - great :)... A special thank you to Mohammed Amin - sport coach at the fitness centre who is a great motivator.
 December 2018,4,Beautiful hotel close to the old and new town,"We are a group of 8 adults and 8 kids and stayed at this property during the X mas season this year. It’s a beautiful hotel with a great location and ambience. We had asked for connecting rooms as we have small kids, however we were given two separate rooms with a common lobby in the middle. This was acceptable but may not be the best with very small kids. An important thing to note here is that the elevators are small and very scary and we would not recommend using them. The sensors on the doors do not work and the doors tend to bang, they also open up sometimes, thus we would suggest to avoid using the lifts in the main building. The breakfast spread is very very nice. They have hot meals, fresh juice and other juices, a variety of teas and coffees and hot chocolate for…"
 December 2018,4,"Lovely Staff, Comfortable Beds, Nice Pools, Best Massage","It's not a 5* hotel in the true sense: Things are slightly run-down; there isn't turn-down service; it can take a long time to get a response when you call for anything from housekeeping to concierge. Breakfast is fine, not amazing. Terrible coffee! Food in general isn't the best. BUT The great stuff: 1. The staff from the restaurants to the spa to the kids club are wonderful. SO kind, so helpful. Special shoutouts to: Khadija from Marcelona restaurant who is so sweet and even gave my daughter a free couscous and veggies dish (off-menu special) one night. Touria, Nheza and Basma from the kids' club. They made my children feel so welcome. They both loved going there. One night, I was late coming back from the Medina with my daughter (rush hour traffic) and Touria stayed with…"
 November 2018,5,A beautiful Hotel with first class service,I stayed for two nights at the Marrakesh Movenpick which is just a few minutes away from the Medina. The hotel is a place of calm from which you can venture forth to the total confusion of the Marrakesh Medina. The hotel has 5 restaurants but I only ate the breakfast at the hotel. Srrvice and food were very good.
 December 2018,2,"Beautiful hotel, Terrible service","I’m currently staying here & it’s a beautiful hotel. That’s where it ends. The service is the worst I’ve ever experienced. I’ve been here for 3 days so far. The problems have been... Electricity goes off in the room on Xmas day, takes over 2 hours for someone to change the fuse. I’ve called 3 times & even went to reception. The 4th time I start getting agitated with reception & within minutes it’s gitten repaired. Key cards are awful- it stopped working, the room was too far from reception so I called them to send someone to let me in. I desperately needed to get in & stated urgency but waited over 45 minutes. After many calls & then a huge rant they sent someone. - again I had to resort to being agitated before someone sorts things out. Oh & the best part- I asked to speak…"
 December 2018,5,My trip to marrakesh,"Great hotel ,great gym/martial art instructor (mohamed amine) , very professional, helping everybody,don’t hesitate to ask him for advices ,helped me get my motivation back ,décent breakfast too The whole experience was pleasing"
 December 2018,5,Splendid and delightful stay,"Spectacular service and gorgeous hotel. In particular, restaurant manager Jawed went above and beyond to ensure we had a fantastic time. It was my little girls birthday and Jawed made sure she was made to feel like a princess. Absolutely splendid and can not recommend enough. Attentive staff such as Affaf at reception made our stay very enjoyable. If there were more stars I would. All very beautiful."
 December 2018,5,Great Spa and Fitness Center!,I always enjoy staying at this hotel. The highlight for me this time was the excellent Fitness Center and Spa facilitates. Mohamed Amin was a fantastic instructor and highly recommended for anyone needing a holiday workout!
 September 2018,4,A good Place to stay,"a very nice hotel to stay , very scenic and the staff are polite...Good spacious rooms and very good service . the room service in particular is very efficient. the front desk is cooperative and friendly . the restaurants are good .."
 December 2018,5,"Great Service, Attentive Staff","Enjoyed my stay here, comfortable rooms and excellent service by Amine, Kenza and Shaimae at the Movenpick Cafe - delighting us each morning! Kasbah like architecture and intriguing banksy grafitti at each corner."
 December 2018,5,The coach Mohamed,Mohamed was amazing at coaching and making me a program that I can go home with! I came into the gym to do a lazy morning run and he turned it into two days of personalized training aimed and long term targets.
 December 2018,5,Fantastic hotel; 5 star quality; 3 star prices.,"Amazing hotel; beautiful, classy and with superb service. Lovely rooms, great pools and restaurants - very much amongst the best in Marrakech and far less expensive than others. Huge but still with fine personalised attention."
 December 2018,5,Great Stay!,"Had a 4 night stay in this hotel and it was great! Beautiful hotel, fantastic rooms, great location and staff. Visited the gym and met Mohammed Amin who gave me a personal training session in the gym, friendly guy and great workout! Only minus is that the WIFI could be better."
 December 2018,5,Good hotel good gym!,"I spent 3 weeks at the movenpick hotel,rooms are spacious and clean, breakfast is good and gym and spa also. In those days I’ve been several time at the gym mostly cause there’s a very good instructor (Mohammed Amin) that really push you up to the limit , he’s very gently and professional. He choose for me a perfect workout and I saw my body changes! So best hotel!"
 December 2018,5,Gym,"I did 3 weeks in this hotel and I am here to write a good review for the hotel in general, but I want to say that the gym service is amazing, Mohamad the trainer is very kind and professional, he teachs very well the body exercises and he takes care off you all the time, usually I don’t like the gym but here I went every day and Mohamad did a very great job. So... go to the gym and ask for mohamad trainer."
 November 2018,5,Perhaps the best hotel in Marrakech,"We had reserved seven nights at the near-by Le Meridien, a hotel not worthy of this famous and fine chain. So we checked out the first morning after a very unpleasant ""welcome"" by a snooty and unhelpful staff and went searching after breakfast for another hotel. We were very fortunate to find this jewel, the Movenpick, on the same avenue and the lovely Hivernage neighborhood as the Meridien. Although quite a bit more expensive, it was worth every penny! The public areas are grand but in a truly elegant way, the room most comfortable with a state-of-the-art bathroom, a charming balcony, and, best of all perhpas, a superb breakfast included in the room rate. Special mention must be made regarding a breakfast room employee, NAIMA, who excels in her attentiveness to detail,…"
 November 2018,4,Beautiful Hotel,Beautiful decor in the hotel. The service was great. Very helpful hotel staff. The breakfast buffet was average really. Better food in the hotel restaurants. Enjoyed my stay here. Had a great massage at the spa. Nothing bad to say really. Rated 4 star because I thought the breakfast wasn’t that good. The room was super clean and bed was sooooo comfy. Would stay here again!
 November 2018,5,Great time,"My family and I had a wonderful time in this hotel. The staff are really helpful especially when they see u with children. I want to thank basma and her team for taking care of my 2 boys in their kindergarten. I also had great time training with Mohamed Amine in the gym. He really cares about his customers and know how to motivate them to push the limits. Don’t not hesitate to ask him personal advise, he is very kind and helpful and a great coach !! Hope to see u soon"
 November 2018,5,Beautiful hotel!! The best!!,"We came to Movenpick to celebrate my husbands birthday, we was greeted at the front of the hotel by the wonderful staff very professional. We fell in love walking through the beautiful entrance leading to the reception. The staff at the reception was so nice and friendly especially Nadia who was always willing to help with anything! Checking in was super fast and went straight into our room. I was a little upset that the hotel did not do anything for my partners birthday as i already sent a request via email and also contacted booking.com to call the hotel which they did and Movenpick did send a email back saying a cake would be put out with a lovely surprise but it was not done. Also the window in the toilet was broke so on the same evening within being in the room for…"
 November 2018,5,Oasis of calm!,Great hotel - very close to the city centre and the old city. Staff were very cool - lots of helpful assistance and offers to advise and make things more comfortable Bedroom was immaculate every day. The cleaning staff did a very cool and thorough clean - like seriously :) pulled out the beds and washed under them etc. Amazing A special thanks to Houda Saltina who was always so helpful at breakfast and at the restaurant Pool and facilities were great
 November 2018,4,Gate 1 Tour: Impressive but not Impressive,"We stayed at the Movenpick Hotel Mansour for 2 nights as part of our Gate 1 Tour of Morocco. Overall, the hotel looks very fancy and refined, and it is for the most part, but there were a few things that could be improved. First off, the property is huge, many buildings, many rooms, a sprawling footprint. Even the main lobbies were a maze of hallways. We were placed in building 1 which is most likely their group building. Rooms were of adequate size, maybe a bit small. We had a toilet that leaked water all night so we needed to keep the bathroom door closed. You will be happy to know, the shower is Western! Best shower of the trip! Movenpick offered free wifi, but the wifi sucked--it was easy to connect to but slower than molasses. We did get good connections out in the…"
 November 2018,5,Kids Club,"I just wanted to thank the care takes at the Kids club at the Movenpick Hotel in Marrakesh, specifically Basma who took such good care of my child. My daughter wanted to be there all day. They did arts and crafts, treasure hunts, face painting and the list goes on.... I was able to leave my daughter and leave the resort feeling relaxed and enjoy some adult time on my vacation. Thank you all so much for giving me some time and entertaining my daughter we will always remember the love warmth and kindness!"
 November 2018,5,Such a beautiful place,"We had an amazing holiday in Mövenpick Marrakech. Hotel’s architecture and decoration is breathtaking and whole area is quiet and beautiful. Breakfast was delicious, room was clean and hotel’s staff was so kind to us. Especially I want to thank waiter Mouchine and amazing personal trainer in the gym. Only bad thing was wifi connection -it didn’t work well in our room. Still I would like to recommend this hotel highly for everyone who adores beautiful design and good service. Thank you!"
 November 2018,5,Very good,"Last week my husband and I arrived in Marrakech for the first time. We travelled to Marrakech to get married and were extremely excited. The moment that we arrived at the hotel we were absolutely impressed, because the Mövenpick is such a gorgeous hotel, on the outside and inside. The moment we were checking in the staff told us that our suite had a technical issue and that we had to wait. So we waited. After an hour of still waiting I asked the reception if we could maybe get some tea or coffee. That wasn't an immediate yes, she had to discuss that with the manager. Ultimately we got coffee while waiting. After two hours I started to get seriously irritated because no one offered us anything, we just had to wait. No communication at all. After those two hours we decided to…"
 November 2018,5,Fitness centre PT,"Excellent personal trainer in this gym. He approached me and was very keen to help plan my workout for the day. He was extremely motivating and very professional. If anyone is a gym goer please ask for Mohammed, he is very willing to help and gave me the best workout I have had in a long time."
 November 2018,4,Great hotel,Stayed here for my birthday trip The hotel is very nice indeed with great pools and gardens. The rooms are very good with plenty of room and balconies. We had the junior suit which was Fantastic All the staff at the hotel were excellent and could not be faulted. The breakfast was very good with a great choice. We ate lunch 1 day and this also was fantastic in the buffet section We ate at the Spanish restaurant which we felt could have been better and this is why it’s not a five marking. Would come again for sure 100%
 October 2018,5,Marcelona Restaurant,"Marcelona restaurant at Movenpick Hotel . This Restaurant is just amazing.One of our top restaurant experiences, The food is delicious and their service is fantastic. Staff are so friendly and attentive.definitely exceed our expectations"
 October 2018,5,Nice expérience,"Great international standard hotel that reflect the arabic style. Good services, nice decoration, good restaurants, gym, bar... ! The breakfast was on top and the personel was really helpful specially Kenza hostess at Saray restaurant .I will come back for sure. Thanks for everything"
 November 2018,1,THEFT OF MONEY,Money was removed from my room - very uncooperative management in dealing with my complaint - Got the impression that they felt my complaint was trivial. The issue is NOT about the amount 'misappropriated' [THEFT ] but about the Fact that this happened at this establishment AND the ATTITUDE of the management of the hotel in NOT being willing to deal with it~ Oh ...there is also no CCTV camera footage available on the floors !
 November 2018,4,Kids Club,Special Thanks to Touria and the friendly team at the kids club for taking care of our daughter ensuring that she was safe and entertained during our stay here. She absolutely loved her time there and couldn't wait to return each day.
 November 2018,5,"Thank you Movenpick Staff, specially Houda Saltani (restaurant staff)",I recently stayed at the Movenpick and I was very impressed with all the services and staff. Especially I want to compliment Houda Saltani who made sure we were very well looked after during breakfast and lunch by the poolside bar. The hotel is amazing and deserves its five stars. Well done to the team. I would highly recommend this hotel because it is close to the centre and old city - all a little walk or a short taxi ride. Thanks guys!
 November 2018,5,Awesome hotel,"This hotel is a certified 5 star. The hotel arranged my transfer from the airport to the hotel. The service is excellent. It reflects the hospitality of the locals. It was always a warm welcome 24/7. I would like to commend Naima from the buffet restaurant, she is so kind and looked after me during my breakfast, what a way to start your day in Marrakech. Concierge could also arrange tours for you. I just hope that the hotel could organize free shuttle to the Medina, if possible. In any case, Medina is not far from the hotel and taxi is affordable. Menara Mall is just 10 minutes away from the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants along Avenue Mohammed VI. I went for dinner at the Marcelona restaurant in the hotel, food and service are awesome. Shout out to the staff of this…"
 November 2018,3,Quite good but could be excellent,Stayed 7 nights at the hotel. Location we found to be very good - Walking distance to the markets in the old part of town but far enough not to be in it all the time. The lobby of the hotel was very nice but oir building Zinade definitrly in need of some repairs. The elevator carpets had partially come off. Our room was on the 5th floor but the view of the aircon units and piping didnt make us want to sit on the terrace. For such rooms probably shouldnt even have a terrace. We found the room nice enough with a large bathroom. Two things about the room were not good: it got extremely hot at night (despite temps of max 12C) and there was noise from the machinery on the rooftop. I am guessing this also caused the heat in the room. Opening a door was not an option unless we want…
 November 2018,5,Wonderful Service Received From Touria,"I recently stayed in the Movenpick hotel with my family and had a great time there, one of the highlights of our trip was the visit to the Kids Club within the hotel where one of the staff member Touria helped lookafter our children, they absolutely loved spending time with Touria who performed different activities like cooking, face painting, dancing, treasure hunting, gardening, colouring and much more. Touria has a great personality and her interaction with our children was amazing so I would highly recommend anyone visitng Marrakech to stay in this hotel and definitely take their kids to the Kids Club and have them make their trip memorable by spending time with the friendly staff there especially Touria. Thank You Touria for all the good work you are doing, pls keep it…"
 November 2018,4,A chandelier that Sia would be proud of!,"I have visited Marrakech a few times and always tend to try different hotels whilst visiting Morocco. Having heard a mixture of reviews my friend had booked this hotel and therefore I decided to stay here. The hotel is located within the Hivernage area of Marrakech and is walking distance from the station and the Menara Mall. Without doubt the entrance and the grounds of this hotel are amazing. The artwork (Banksy style) makes it even more intriguing and adds to the large display of artwork around the hotel. The chandelier in the main lounge is simply beautiful and the concierge explained the names of each of the difference sections of rooms located around the hotel which I found interesting. Unfortunately, as many have explained, the rooms were a tad underwhelming. My friend…"
 October 2018,4,Lovely Hotel,"this was our first time visiting Marrakech and this hotel certainly did contribute to a fabulous mini break! Our suite was just perfect - a large walk in wardrobe, huge bathroom and a comfy bed. The only downside that I can highlight was the noise from the nightclub opposite and the associated view from our balcony! The extensive breakfast buffet ensured that there was something for everyone. Service was a tad slower than I would have liked but it did not impact our break. Point to note - the hairdryer supplied was not very effective, take your own."
 November 2018,4,Front Desk (check-in /Check-out),"Front Desk employees should be more courteous when gusts are checking-in.... They should strive to provide the best ""1st impression"". The check in process was so so - they were all busy chatting between them instead of attending all of us who were in line....Then, only one employee ended up helping the long waiting-line...Front desk should also be more tactful and nice with guests."
 October 2018,5,Pleasant Stay,"It was my first time visiting Marrakech as a winner from Movenpick Hotel JBR Dubai & I’m blessed to this opportunity that I have had to visit this beautiful Marrakech. Everything went smoothly & up to the standards starting from the arrival & ending to the departure. All staff was very blessed & hospitalized from the doormen, concierge, reception, housekeeping, restaurant, in room dining, call centre & gym. I felt that I’m in my second home & enjoyed a lot. Restaurant has had the most delicious Moroccan authentic food that I will never forget the taste of it. The experience with the tourist tours was absolutely great & I enjoyed every moment either in Marrakech or even during our stay at Movenpick Hotel Casablanca. I’ll definitely repeat my visit to beautiful Morocco. …"
 November 2018,5,Excellent for families,"Fantastic hotel with the best kids club! Our 3 children didn’t want to leave! Special mention to Touria and Basma from the Kids club for their outstanding care, and especially Touria who babysat on 2 nights. Highly recommended."
 November 2018,5,Kids Club was amazing!,"The Kids Club at the Movenpick was highly useful and entertaining for my children. The kids loved it here and it was a great place to drop them off and pick them up during the day. The staff were extremely friendly, 3 ladies named Touria, Nazha and Basma looked after the kids very well and were always there to entertain them. Lunch was provided by kitchen staff who always had a smile on their face and stayed positive. Their programme through the day was impeccable, it included cooking, face painting, dancing, treasure hunting, gardening, colouring and much more. Overall the visit was wonderful and Kids Club was a great aspect to the hotel."
 September 2018,5,Wonderful Hotel in Marrakech!,Mövenpick Hotel Marrakech is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy your vacation. The rooms are very spacious and equipped with all your heart needs. With 503 rooms and suites it spreads out on a huge terrain you need a while to get to your room. The walk through most wonderful kept gardens and greenery is a dream. The six restaurants and Bars and a Spa will satisfy all your needs. Most wonderful the different 4 !! pool areas where you can enjoy the day in the sun or under the umbrella. On the pool-side as well restaurants and bars with great service. Specially for families a great deal – you will find a kids club as well as a pool for kids and many other amenities. I enjoyed my time at Mövenpick very much and can highly recommend the place.
 October 2018,5,Amazing kids club!,"Love this hotel. Turia, Basma Nezha really looked after our girls during our stay. The gardening added a nice twist to the ball park and arts and craft activities. Highly reccomended! Great family escape."
 October 2018,3,Mixed review,"We were a party of 12, chaps played golf and us ladies were there for a relaxing few days. We were in block 7, room 7407, lovely room, not such a nice view of the car park. Balcony door didn’t lock.....The rooms in this block are noisy at night particularly early hours as the night club across the way closes early hours, particularly bad on a Friday night/Saturday morning. Hotel accommodated 2 couples moving rooms but not all of us which was disappointing. We only eat in the hotel at lunchtime and breakfast, unfortunately lunch was very slow although the food was good when it arrived. We also struggled to get an itemised bar bill early evening before we went out. The breakfast area and food was lovely. You do need to do something about the coffee machine queues…"
 October 2018,4,So much to like,"Enjoyed a 5 night stay at the Movenpick. There is a lot to like about it. Rooms are spacious and quiet in building 7. Big balcony to enjoy and the bathrooms are quite large. Pools, spa and main lobby areas are quite lovely. All staff are friendly and helpful. Two major setbacks stops me from rating it 5 stars. Room wifi was horrible. I asked for it to be checked, but don’t think it was. The property is so large, not sure they have enough routers. Perhaps an IT expert can check this for them. It was very annoying having to always go closer to the lobby area to get good wifi. The second issue was restaurants. For dinner, only one good option for a large property. Would have been nice to have another option for guests who don’t want to leave the property. Other than…"
 October 2018,5,Amazing dinner at Marcelona Restaurant,"It s all about the Marcelona restaurant and its amazing authentic Spanish food and great service. I was invited to eat out with some business partner who were Spanish and really missed their food, and it was very satisfying for them and me. The decor is so chic and the colors are so welcoming and as soon as we got in the staff and manager took great care of us, we felt welcomed and comfortable which is rare these days. We ordered lots of food to share and taste and it was just delicious, and had to order more just to try other dishes. The deserts were tasty and very well presented so I would say Kudos to the Chefs for a perfect meal and Big thanks to the staff and manager for really making me and my clients feel like home."
 October 2018,5,"Tasty food, amazing atmosphere","As i l visiting marrakech, one of my friend from qatar advise me to visit Marcelona restaurant, because she knows that i like Spanish food, it was a great experience, the food was so tasty especially the paella and the pil-pil, the staff are very friendly the service was excellent the atmosphere is amazing, unfortunately i will recommend this restaurant to all my friends."
 September 2018,2,"The good, the bad and the ugly","Location: In the middle of an area which is full of Hotels, some 50-70 Dirhams away from the main attractions. Room: The good, a very nice room, big and spacious, a very nice bath and shower, with nearly all in that you could expect. Serious problems with stocking/restocking the Minibar. The ugly: The room was in a building at the far end of the real estate and no umbrellas are available. Going from the reception to your room could get you soaked. Food: The Spanish Restaurant had good food, good drinks and good service. The breakfast is a mixed bag, when it was full, long lines for the coffee developed quickly. For a Hotel of that size nothing specacular. Room Service was fast and delivered good Quality Public Areas: A large pool fo which 2/3rds are pretty flat, otherwise a…"
 October 2018,5,Excellent luxury hotel,Stayed here 8 days on business. Luxury hotel. Very stylish and lots of art abounds. Great outdoor swimming pools. Rooms very comfortable. Breakfast is pretty good. Staff generally food quality service. Not cheap but reasonable for the facilities. Location means need taxi to town but is taxi rank outside hotel. Takes 5 mins costs 50 to 100 Dirham.
 October 2018,5,Mansour Eddahbi,"Excellent hotel. Perfect place for a vacation. Attentive service, great food. Poolside facilities wonderful, all the guys at the pool couldn’t do enough for you. Lovely suites. It would be hard to fault anything. Breakfasts were just a great start to the day. A amazing display of SO many food choices."
 October 2018,5,Great hotel,"Excellent hotel , the crew was fantastic . Special thanks to Sana el Farassi for her hard work in housekeeping , she went the extra mile to make sure everything was perfect during our stay . The food was excellent as well , plenty of restaurants to choose from."
 October 2018,4,Grand Hotel,"Enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Very large modern rooms came with two double veds, with excellent air conditioning. Beautiful and functional shower. Also important in this day and age of technology is plenty of outletss that work! All the roooms provide safes. The hotel lobby and commib spaces are stunning."
 October 2018,5,Massage at the hotel,"I had a massage at their spa and it was the best. Fatine really did a wonderful job. I had a deep tissue massage, and it was very good. Fatine was professional and very polite. Thank you so much for a wonderful massage"
 October 2018,4,An oasis in the desert,"The location is really great,settled in the ‘rich’ area of Marakech.Fountains all around the structure are breathtaking and so the swimming pool.We had a bit of delay at check in since the room wasn’t ready but despite that everyone was nice."
 September 2018,4,100 strong,"This was a lovely hotel. Rooms, restaurant, bars and pool all very good. The check out was very slow. Location is good as it has a number of other places to spend time very close. Most attractions are with in 15 mins travel."
 September 2018,4,magnifique sejour,"it was an amazing experience , hospitality , good service, good moments , discovering new things , excited to do it again!! thanks to all employees ,they were kind and helpful ,specially tarik thanks to him !! it was such a confortable trip!"
 September 2018,5,Not perfect but highly recommend for the price,"The hotel has a great lobby, pool area, and rooms but certain areas let it down in terms of being a little tired for a 5 star hotel - the lounger cushions are very comfortable but a bit worn out, the lifts to the hotel rooms are very shabby and the spa could do with a paint in the steam rooms and locker rooms. Having said that it is priced lower than other 5 star hotels in marrakech so you have to take that into consideration. We found the service to be excellent throughout especially the waiters at breakfast who always served us quickly and kept us topped up with coffees and freshly squeezed orange juice. The breakfast is excellent with lots of choice. Overall we had a great stay, we'll return and we'd recommend this hotel."
 August 2018,5,Mansoo Bar,"I have been to the mansoo more then once, with friends and family, I gotta admit I am still going back because it's one of the best places in marrakech ! The service is top notch and the food is incredible ! Definitely going back !"
 September 2018,5,marrakech's best hotel,"hotel was soo beautiful, clean rooms, very classy, front desk are very very professional and smiling all time, waiting just to serve you and make sure your stay is very comfortable i say thank you yo Said and Abdellatif for making my stay great i recommend this hotel."
 September 2018,4,Good Hotel - Could be a great hotel,"Great Pool - some of the deck side chairs need to be recovered , a number of the umbrella’s are broken or in disrepair. Pool staff are reasonably attentive, but there is no place for a tip when you do a room charge, so you need to take cash to the pool. Restaurant food is acceptable, breakfast buffett is outstanding. Bar service is adequate. Hotel rooms are nice, comfortable, air conditioned."
 September 2018,3,Good but not great,"This hotel has all the makings of a great hotel but falls down in a few areas. The rooms are great, spacious, comfortable and very clean. Pool area is lovely and well maintained. Breakfast selection is very good with great omelet station. However, the hotel is like a maze with no signage to find your way around. After 4 days there, I was still getting lost trying to find anything, especially in lobby area which is enormous and very confusing. As many others have said, the service here is not good. There are lots of staff but they don’t know what they are doing. Six bar staff and it takes 20 mins for them to serve a gin and tonic. I was close to offering to do it myself. The most frustrating thing was that many people in our group had minibar charges on their bill when…"
 September 2018,4,Great hotel but service could be improved,"The Movenpick is a wonderful oasis in busy Marrakech and the hotel is very modern and clean. The room we had was in beautiful shape and the grounds are kept very clean. The one fault would be the service, particularly in the restaurants and with the concierge and front desk staff. It could be very slow at times and the concierge could not respond to some pretty basic requests for information. Overall, you will enjoy this hotel for a relaxing break in Marrakech and the amenities, property and rooms are all wonderful."
 September 2018,5,Perfect,"Have 0 complaints about this hotel, everything was perfect from top to bottom. Khalid Mawloud and his team were to hand to accomadate all queries, from restaurant recommendations, currency exchange, sim activation, to taxi advice. The room was absolutely beautiful, and I would have 0 qualms about staying here again. It’s well located, the breakfast is great and the pools are fantastic. Highly recommended!"
 September 2018,1,Worse restaurant ever,"9.45pm, 2 restaurants out of 3 are closed. Only one left open is Spanish: Marcelona You walk into the restaurant, no one to greet you. Finally they sit you at a table which is not clean. 15 minutes later take the order (ham and bread, gambas al ajillo, croquetas). 25 minutes later arrives the ham and bread. Still no drink. 35 minutes later arrives the gambas in some kind of tomato sauce, with the drink. The croquetas never arrived. All the staff are running around, the managers also. Some restaurants are better closed."
 August 2018,5,Amazing hotel walking distance to everything.,I stayed hear for a week and I can not fault their excellent service especially Sana and another lady at the reception. Sanas customer service was the best when we checked in to our room it was filthy and we got upgraded to a presidential suit which was perfect with the pool near and it was such an amazing experience I would recommend this hotel to any one and everyone who visits Marrakech.
 August 2018,5,Fantastic!,"This was our second stay at Mövenpick (in Marrakech) and it never disappoints. We also stayed there December 2017. The service is great with all staff being helpful and ready to be of any assistance. Both times we had our 6 year old son with us and he thoroughly enjoyed the kids club. Even when he was in the pool the lifeguard and pool staff kept an eye on him even though we were sat right there. We are going back in October (next month) and staying at Mövenpick again! It’s a great location, short walk away from local shops/ cafes/restaurants. The buffet breakfast also has a lovely variety of hot and cold food. I cannot fault the hotel or its staff! Definitely recommend!"
 August 2018,4,Outstanding hotel design confort and kids club,"Hôtel design is really awesome, Rooms so comfortable and spacious the suite makes you feel like home. Kids club is really my biggest super good surprise, the staff is so lovely with the kids and really passionate, kids didn’t want to leave them they made our stay memorable and relaxing. Thks to the lovely instructors👏🏼 Breakfast was excellent and varied but food for lunch or dinner a disaster a scam!! Service not worthy a 5star, staff quite nice but you need to be behind to have service completed."
 August 2018,3,"Gorgeous hotel, average service","Stayed for one day before heading to the airport. It's a gorgeous hotel, recently renovated with fabulous pools. Rooms are great, too. But as with many places in Morocco, it's the service that lets the place down. From a disappearing concierge, dismissive reception staff and impossible-to-find bar staff by the pool, it became a bit of a running joke for us. We foolishly forgot our sunscreen at the last hotel, and with a 3 year old in tow needed some. Concierge says ""there is none in the hotel"". Ok, where can we buy some? ""At the pharmacy"". Right, where is that? ""It's a public holiday so they're all closed"". Any other suggestions for sunscreen? ""No"". Hmm, not the service expected at a 5 star hotel. Thankfully we stumbled across the kids club and, as expected, they had some and…"
 August 2018,4,Good hotel breathtaking lobby decor,"Decor was brilliant, extraordinary hotel lobby designs, spectacular furniture, fixture and fittings in lobby. Rooms were average designs, our AC didn't work very well but staff did offer us an alternative room but that was too warm with the AC not working very well. We just stuck with our original room and the nights git very warm sometimes a bit difficult to sleep, that was the only down fall from the hotel. Hotel was very busy but still had time for you. Afternoon tea and snack was complimentary and was a good touch. Childrens club was excellent and staff did everything to make your child feel special, a great team. Swimming pool was good but again very busy and you hardly got any sunbeds during the daytime. Breakfast was good with a lot of variety and fresh omelettes…"
 August 2018,5,3 wonderful nights in Marrakech Movenpick,"Hi Guys, picked the family up from our family home in Rabat and head over to Marrakech. Firstly we arrived early at the hotel so we assumed we will be at loose ends until check-in time. Reception could see we had kids so Kindly searched for an available room that will allow us to check-in immediately. They could have simply said ""computer said no"" but from the start, you could see that staff want to be helpful and not resistant. Not only did we get an early check-in but also got an upgrade... what a lovely result. We stayed in room 5002 which was a suite, very clean and the bed was so comfortable, you just sink into the pillows. I want to give a special mention to the kids club, they were really friendly and really worked hard for the kids. I have a 6 year old boy and 7…"
 August 2018,2,Noisy hotel terrible pillows,"If you want to rest, this is a terrible place. Plenty of noise from surrounding discos and aquapark at night. Beds are comfortable, pillows way too soft. After two nights you will feel broken. Most of the staff isn’t very motivated nor helpful. Lovely swimming pool but not enough sunbeds/umbrellas. People have to lay in the grass. Fitness was lovely before now moved to the spa. Way too small and packed. I can’t recommend this hotel"
 August 2018,5,"Spacious Rooms, delightful service, good food.","Although we only stayed for one night, we could not fault the hotel. Check in was smooth, our family room was spacious and modern and the food was tasty and of a good quality. Communal areas were clean and of a high standard whilst all the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful."
 July 2018,5,Excellent hotel and a memorable stay,"At first, I was a little hesitant to book this hotel after reading entirely different reviews. After long thought and seeing the beautiful interiors, I went ahead and scheduled my visit. Please take into consideration that I visited during the low season (July), so the hotel was not as busy as it would usually be. Upon arrival, the staff were very welcoming and directed me through to reception where I was able to check in quickly and efficiently. As I was guided through to my room, the porter informed me of where the restaurants and facilities were on the grounds which came in use as the hotel does not have a directory or a map so there could be parts of the hotel that I never discovered. I stayed in a classic room and was surprised by the size. It was very spacious and had an…"
 July 2018,4,Lovely hotel but could be run better,"I think the Movenpick was having a bad week when we stayed. Check-in was quite chaotic and queues were long. We were assigned the wrong room at first (a twin room rather than a double). A few other guests were having similar issues from what I could gather; I heard someone complaining to reception because they were given a room with somebody already in it! Our room key stopped working intermittently, so we were back and forth to reception a lot. Then the lift broke, so we had to walk up and down 3 flights of stairs multiple times a day for our whole stay. Not too much of an issue for us, but it did make me wonder about the disabled guests. The air con in our room was more of a lukewarm fan (I assume it was faulty?) so sleeping was uncomfortable some nights. We asked someone…"
 July 2018,5,Best hotel ever!,"I can say this was probably the best hotel I've stayed at! The reception was absolutely breathtaking and always smelled amazing. Our room was very neat and tidy, the bathroom was big and clean. Overall the decor of the room was very luxurious. The staff were really welcoming towards us from the moment we stopped into the hotel, they were really attentive and took very good care of us. There was also a breakfast buffet included with our room and it was just simply amazing, they had a wide variety of foods to choose from and the food was delicious. On the hotel compound they had about 5 restaurants to choose from, we ate the main one ( I cannot recall the name) and the food was amazing. I definitely recommend staying at this hotel you will not be disappointed!."
 July 2018,5,Summer Holiday with Sister - 16th July 1 week,"This was our 2nd visit to the Movenpick and what was really lovely to be remembered by some of the staff there, who deserve a special mention. Omar, in the restaurant at breakfast, looked after us so well, and even delivered fresh coffees to our sunbed. And then there was Anas our pool butler, so helpful and friendly. A little child was falling asleep on the sunbed so he went out of his way to find an umbrella and cover the sun so the little one could sleep - how lovely is that. We also met Jihane, one of the waiters, on this trip who joined the hotel in March. From the minute we arrived on Monday afternoon she could not do enough for us, her English is really good and she couldn't do enough for us during our stay. It was so hot on this trip and we were given buckets of ice…"
 July 2018,3,Inconsistent!,"Negative points. Prior to arrival we booked a transfer via the hotel concierge to collect us from the airport. It never arrived! After 40 minutes of waiting, we called the hotel to chase this & eventually a car was sent for us. Not what we’d expect when paying a premium for a transfer. Shortly into our stay we heard from other guests that an event/ conference for 700 people was taking place at the hotel that day. This meant paying guests could not use the main pool or bar for the entire day. In the evening as part of the event a party took place around the pool. Paying guests were not permitted to enter. The music was horrendously loud, with heavy bass. At 10:30pm I called reception to enquire as to when this would end, I was advised 11pm. At 11:30pm the music continued, I…"
 July 2018,5,"Superb service from Khadija, Mehdi, Essef, Jessus and the Manager Jaouad","I arrived at the hotel on Monday and being a vegetarian didn’t find much on the menu to eat . I was not very happy about that and conveyed my feelings to the waitor and waitress. They then called Jaouad Eddajjani, who was the manager who sorted all the problems out. The chef called Jessus came out to talk to me and offered to make me whatever I wanted. Jessus was very helpful and made many dishes for me and my family , which were all very tasty and wholesome and fresh. He was very patient and sincere and made the food with much love and passion . He took great joy in knowing that I was enjoying his food which conveys to me a very loyal and good worker. The staff Khadija, Mehdi and Essef were very accommodating , polite and kind. . They were doing their best to…"
 July 2018,2,Not Great,"Having had our flight cancelled and turning up to this hotel, we were expecting a very solid nights stay, with top quality service and 3 meals that Easyjet had said we were going to have, and the maddest few hours ensued. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 10pm and a whole flight's worth of people got off and were told to go to reception to get allocated rooms. The people behind the reception desk were relatively good, albeit quite rude, but understandably so as having to check in nearly 200-300 people at 10pm was not expected at all until nigh on one hour before, but still, nothing much that could have been done so they could have been a bit less rude as no one wanted to be in that situation. Once allocated the room, and very quickly may I add, I was pleasantly…"
 July 2018,2,Incompetence,"Luckily we were only there for 24 hours, after a flight was cancelled and we were put up here for the night. Staff were rude and completely incapable if communication, producing itemised bills, telling you how much sonething cost, bringing food out and there was something dodgy going on with the card machines. Not expected at all from such a chain and when we first arrived looked so beautiful. Wouldn't return, not even for one night"
 June 2018,4,Movenpick eddahbi marrakesh,"I stayed at movenpick eddahbi during the months of June for 4 days and initially had a few issues with my room and not being attended to correctly by some staff on the first day which was slightly upsetting. However, we eventually managed to speak to Mr amine Berre the guest relation manager who was very helpful and hospitable and immediately assisted me and my friends and rectified our issues. I would like to thank Mr Amine Berre for his excellent service and would like to express that he is a fantastic manager. Due to his help we enjoyed the rest of our stay at the hotel. The breakfast menu was nice but i feel Could have provided an extended variety of food considering it is a 5* hotel."
 July 2018,5,Great stay @ Movenpick Marrakech,"I stayed in Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi from July 14 to 16, 2018. I was travelling with my family. We had a very enjoyable time and stay the superior room given to me was amazing, it was very spacious and comfortable. The hotel has very nice facilities, aside from the the Pools and the restaurants, overall ambiance was great. We had dinner in the restaurant the Food attendant was very friendly, cant remember his exact name probably Mehmed he is a young good looking guy with a very good english diction. Also a very accommodating Manager who was there to look after us as well Mr. Jaouad Eddajjani. Their kids center is amazing, my daughter had so much fun with their 2 staff who was very friendly, Rouua? (she was wearing eyglasses) and Ikhbal. Front desk staff was very helpful I…"
 July 2018,3,Room needs improvement,"Big nice hotel, grand designed of the lobby. All The staffs are welcoming, service good. But the rooms are quite disappointing. We booked two rooms for a family holiday. But both of the rooms are not that good as show on the website. Room size are ok. But carpet dirty, sockets failed, broken curtains,broken coffee machine, toilet locks broke, broken bathroom door, some light bulbs broke, birds poo on the fence of balcony, balcony glass fence was full of dust and ashes, balcony floor dirty leaves ours feet grey and dark. Ordered two extra pillows but wait for four hours delivered after chasing them. Overall the rooms are disappointing but hotel environment and staffs were good . It’s a over rated five stars hotel."
 July 2018,3,luxurious overall but room for improvement,"I just stayed for 3 days. Check in was brutal. Argument over extra person which was my teenage daughter. They wanted to charge me extra since the reservation did not include her by booking error on the app. Then came the room assigned. Moldy and not a garden view. Then tears, more complaining. 1 hour later finally in my room which was booked as a king but ended up a queen. The room was ok, pretty pool view which I guess was their version of an upgrade?? Said, the manager finally tried to make me happy after they pushed me to a meltdown. So besides a terrible check in, the actual room was small, It had a dirty carpet, the bathroom counter was not cleaned. and some stains on the setee. The location of the room was noisy so beware and don’t get a room near an elevator or above the…"
 July 2018,5,Best stay in Marrakech..top service,On our second visit to Marrakech we stayed for 2 nights here. The hotel looks stunning from outside including the walk from the entrance to the reception. Our room was as you would expect from a 5 star hotel however only negative is no usb charging slots and reception did not have adapters for the UK plugs however to be fare we did find one 3 pin socket but it was away from the bed. What I really liked about our stay was the service. All the staff including Mr Said at reception were the most welcoming we ever met! We asked for a late check out no problem. Room service staff very polite and smiling. The staff at breakfast were very polite and kept asking if we were ok and offered to serve us with drinks! Mint tea served as we pleased. All in all they made us feel welcome…
 July 2018,5,Wonderful Babysitter!,"My husband and I stayed at the Movenpick in Marrakech for 9 days. We came primarily for work and brought our 15 month old daughter with us. I was a little nervous about finding a babysitter in Morocco since she is so young, but the idea of leaving her behind for one week made me more uncomfortable. So, I arranged for a babysitter through the hotel. First of all, the Moroccan culture is extremely warm and welcoming to babies and children, so it felt right that I brought my little one along. But most importantly, we had a fabulous babysitter at the Movenpick. Her name is Raouia and she is on the staff of the kids club at the hotel. She was so kind, responsible, helpful, calm, and easy to communicate with. She speaks multiple languages and put me at ease upon meeting her. My…"
 July 2018,4,SHINE in Marrakech,Amazing hotel near to the city center. Rooms big and clean with city view. 2 main pools to enjoy and relax. Bar with Projector that you could see also Soccer match of World Cup. Interesting breakfast with local products. The cuisine is the only thing that needs a slight improvement (both quality & quantity).
 July 2018,5,Kids club,"The kids club is very nice within the hot. My daugther and niece loved it. They do everything to amuse the children. Nice games, dancing, painting, good food and very gentle supervisors. If you have children I would definitely recommend this resort."
 June 2018,4,Good,"Duration of stay: 7 Nights (23rd to 30th July 2018) Type of stay: Couples holiday Board: Bed and breakfast Room Type: Superior King Size Written on last evening prior to AM departure. I have been fortunate to visit Marrakech 6 times now and have stayed at various locations throughout. This was my first time attending this hotel with a view of experiencing a mixture of a relaxing and leisurely holiday. Staff: Throughout the duration of our stay the staff at the hotel in all areas; from the bedroom maid to reception staff, were very polite and attentive to our needs. Some spoke English fluently, but others who did not were able to understand my broken French and actions. In our experience we felt this did not hinder our experience with the staff or any requests. Although for…"
 June 2018,5,One person made a difference,"I loved my stay at that beautiful hotel. However, one person - Mrs. Naama that works at the morning restaurant made The difference! She paid attention to me from the moment I walked in until the very last minute when I got up to leave. Her sensitivity, her kindness and exceptional professionalism, made me feel pampered, cared for. She took the 'extra step' even in sending me a card with dozens of roses when she found out that it was my birthday. Mrs. Naama is an asset to the hotel - a blessing to every guest who meets her. Dr. Henya Shanun-Klein"
 June 2018,5,Kids Club,The kids club was so Fun I enjoyed it a lot we didn’t so many activities from building lego’s to swimming to baking I really enjoyed the kids club I recommended a lot if you want your kids to have fun just go to the kids club
 April 2018,5,One of the best hotels to Visit in Marrekesh,"This place is simply awesome. It's a beautiful resort hotel. Stunning pools, resort style environment with rooms that are 5 star quality. Very upscale and relaxing environment with great food quality and numerous selections for breakfast. I highly recommend!"
 June 2018,4,Lovely time,"Had a lovely 7 nights in Mövenpick hotel,lovely friendly atmosphere and the staff were so helpful. I would like to mention a lady Nayna at breakfast time,she was absulutely a lovely lady and looked after us so well,and very professional with her job. Thank you once again till we visit you again. Harshika Hirani"
 June 2018,5,Best staff ever at the hotel (Bahija) 🌹,"We are from the UK and have stayed here for 6 days (12-17th June) and during our breakfast we had the most amazing waitress. Bahija looked after us above and beyond her duties, she was so helpful and always had the biggest and heartwarming smile. I would deffinately recommend her to anyone that visits this hotel to see her. We stayed at room 2319 which had the swimming pool view from the third floor. Bahija gets 10 out of 10 from us"
 June 2018,4,Excellent !! Recommended stay everything you need,"I have just returned from a weeks stay at the Mövenpick resort. Grounds; lovely surroundings the lobby area is first class, beautiful touches with the velvet chairs and water fountains. The entrance is very impressive huge attention to detail has been well thought of here ! Rooms; nice size and equipped with everything you need. Staff were very happy to give us two sets of brand new hangers when we asked for some and more and tea and coffee on request this was never a problem. Rooms are cleaned to a good standard. Gym and Spa; used this most days. Excellent equipment in the gym with everything you need. My only reservation would be that the air con needs to be on and windows closed as it did get very warm! It also could be cleaned more regularly as the bin was usually full…"
 May 2018,5,Rest and Relaxation,My stay at Mövenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech has been wonderful. After a long plane ride it was a pleasure to be greeted with mint tea. The staff were warm and welcoming during my stay. I enjoyed my accommodations and will book this hotel again whenever I vacation in Marrakech.
 June 2018,5,Amazing amazing Super with amazing service.,"As u are aware Dubai is fake ( and human right ,,,, whattsssssss?..); South Africa is a place where people CAN t live toghether, My Italy.. I prefer to keep silence about rude, impolite manners . dirty expensive places ( sorry but is true) and London ( where I live is becoming a dangerous town. , Morocco is a place where u can find peace , respect, kind people, like YS Laurent said.

 May 2018,4,Room Service and Room Charges,"Just got back from the Movenpick hotel in Marrakesh after a 3 night stay. had a nightmare with signing food and drink to the room. 3 hours wasted to and from the reception and on the phone to bank . Eventually was made to pre-pay money before hand . This is before we had even spent it . The icing on the cake was been told the money I don't spend can't be refunded as it's a ""chore "" for them . Basically robbing me . Apart from the embarrassment of looking cheap the hotel is beautiful . I would recommend staying there in a heart beat as you really have to see it to believe it . Just a shame they fell at the last hurdle ."
 May 2018,3,clean but staff need some polishing.,"OK, not a bad hotel by any means but some significant irritations during our stay which a little bit of staff training could resolve. There is obviously a culture of extracting cash from tourists in Marrakech, and I get that. However, the guy that took our luggage to our rooms didn't take it to the rooms for 30 minutes so we couldn't change. To add insult to injury I tipped him for all 4 couples but he then took a further tip which my polite brother offered. The dining experience left a lot to be desired. Although the dining room was nearly empty we had to share menus. One member of staff repeatedly took the wine list away (perhaps for religious reasons?) but then when we did order a bottle of wine the cheeky wine waiter told us one bottle was insufficient!!!! - A new…"
 May 2018,1,4* food,"The standard of food at this hotel is terrible... I don’t need to say anything, the picture says enough 🤢 I can honestly say I have never had such bad quality Save your money and go to McDonald’s- thank me after !"
 May 2018,5,Fantastic hotel and service,"We jyst cane back from Marrakech today where we stayed at the Movenpick and had a great stay. We were in the 2 bedroom suite which was new, clean and modern. We had great house keeping service including a turndown service. Will definitely stay again next time."
 April 2018,3,"Beautiful hotel, poor service","The hotel is located fairly closely to the airport and a short taxi ride (€5-8) from the old town. We stayed at the hotel for five days and had a ""family room"" (i.e., two adjacent rooms) on the ground floor of the Zidane building. The hotel lobby area and the grounds are beautiful and the rooms are fine, although they feel a bit dated considering that the hotel was renovated fairly recently. Also, the kids club (free and starting at age 4) is good and proved to be pretty helpful during the rainy days we had. Similarly, the buffet restaurant offers nice breakfasts and ok dinners (although dinners are fairly pricey given the quality). The main thing that lets this place down is the service. On the day of arrival, I asked about a pressing service for my shirts and suits and was…"
 May 2018,5,Nice holiday,"We ( 2 adult and 3 boys, age 11, 9 and 5) spend 1 week in this beautiful hotel. We had a really wonderful time. Every one of the staff was so friendly. the entrance /lobby of the hotel was amazing. The rooms Nice and clean. A special Thank you to naima in the restaurant during breakfast. Every morning she was always so Nice and positieve, such a Nice way to start the day! Lots of choice during breakfast. Annas at the pool so friendly and and also keeping the kids safe. And Sweet Ghislaine and the Spa gave me such a Nice moroccain hammam experiense , it was super! All together we had a great time and hopefully we Will come back next year. Souad el Aouaji -Farouk"
 May 2018,5,"Great hotel, especially the bar staff","This isn’t my first visit here and I’ve been meaning to leave a review. This hotel is amazing and highly recommended to everyone even family holidays. The hotel staff are so curteous and welcoming especially the bar staff. There was a gentleman in particular called Ayoub, I believe that was his name... he was very pleasant and always made sure that me and my partner were well looked after. I will never forget his smile and how he was so attentive and treated all the guests the same. I wish I could give him more then just 5 stars. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 We will def be returning here again!"
 May 2018,5,Best kids club ever,"We have just stayed for three days in May and we love the hotel . But it definitely has a great kids club , the staff are friendly and caring and my kids want to spend the holiday in there . For families with younger children this is definitely worth being top of your list. All the staff are friendly and attentive but the ladies in the kids club are superb and have really made our stay both relaxing and fun."
 May 2018,5,Kidszone,"Stayed at Movenpick with my two children ages 1 & 3 Years Hotel was great food was good kidszone is a great place in the hotel to leave your kids or stay with them so they get to interact with other kids it is provided free of charge by the hotel kids get to play, dress up and learn about the Moroccan culture as well as painting and story time. My daughter loved it so much she wanted to stay there."
 May 2018,4,Ahlam,"This is not my first stay in this hotel ,already been here many times, the kids love it here 😊especially the kids club where the stuff is amazing , very good with the little ones , creating many activities for them and very helpful and patient.. would definitely comeback especially where my kids are happy so I can relax and enjoy the sun while they are in safe hands 😊."
 April 2018,5,Excellent,"We stayed one night in this hotel. This hotel is new and location is good. The lobby is big and comfortable! The room is cleaned and standard five stay hotel room sizes; services was good and foods ok , highly recommended!"
 April 2018,5,Excellent place,"A very nice place I went there with a few friends and we had a great experience one of the waiters was very professional and attentive We went to marcelona and we had a delicious dinner composed from a several tapas, A good Moroccan wine (lumiere) THANKS MEHDIIIII 💙💙💙💙 coming back soon"
 April 2018,1,Not even close to 5 star,"It is undoubtedly an attractive place, but that’s where the allure ends. Food options are limited and the meals I had (Jambra, room service) were bland and overpriced. It’s not hard to make a decent chicken panini... I had to ask 3 separate people and wait over 24 hours just to get a kettle sent to the room, despite tea bags and coffee being in there already. I had to ask a guy to show me how he would make a cup of tea before the penny dropped. Check in and check out experience was too long, badly organized and with staff more interested in talking among themselves and looking at their phones. My company got me a basic room which had a wonderful view of an air conditioning unit. The air conditioning in my room did not work and just blew hot air around. I asked to have it…"
 April 2018,5,Oasis in Marrakech,"I recently stayed at Movenpick after leaving a riad I had booked in the medina due to its poor condition and bad area. When I stepped foot in Movenpick I was delighted with the beauty and service. The room was very spacious and the bathroom high end. One also gets free access to the wonderful hammam if you are a guest, which I took advantage of and loved. When I return to Marrakech I will definitely stay here again."
 April 2018,1,Poor service,House keeping is asleep and simply does not bother to respond to requests even repeated requests. I thought this was just my bad luck until I met another guest who had an identical experience. It's a pity as it's a beautiful hotel.
 April 2018,2,Rooms lack basic items though hotel design is beautiful,"Rooms do not have a hairdryer, iron, or conditioner (for hair). The water kettle and desk lamp do not work. I am here for a business conference and have no way of ironing my clothes to look presentable. We are 350+ conference delegates here and many of us are complaining about this same problem. As a top-end hotel, the Movenpick should provide these basic amenities in all rooms. However, the design of the hotel is stunning and the decor beautiful. The staff have been warm and friendly. I am still here and hope management can address this issue quickly."
 April 2018,5,Amazing!,"Absolutely loved my stay, everything was amazing: great selection of food for breakfast; delicious dinner buffets in Moroccan style; well-equipped gym; several pools. Marcelona restaurant is serving Spanish cuisine in Catalan style - amazing tapas and main dishes, felt myself like in Spain but loved it even more. Chocolate hours are the great opportunity to try signature Movenpick chocolate and sweets. Highly recommend this hotel for vacation in Marrakech or short comfortable stays as it’s very central located and Medina with all the main attractions are in walking distance."
 April 2018,4,Lovely hotel friendly staff,The hotel is very modern and well fitted out. The reception staff were very helpful although at times there could be more at peak times. Both pools were clean and the pool staff friendly and the pool bar served good food. The half board menu is very tasty and has many very varied tagines and all fresh and plentiful. The only issue I have is the sound of car horns at 5am every morning from people leaving the night club next to the hotel. Would recommend it as a convenient location for exploring Marrakech.
 April 2018,5,Will go back - no doubt,"went with 11 year old son, great luxury hotel for children, they are really welcomed. Junior Suite was fantastic Service great Atmosphere was perfect Pool scene great, large pool is heated all year, this for some reason is hard to get confirmed, but it is heated to a temperature you are able to enjoy it. Special mention to whoever runs the team around the pool and pool restaurant - extremely organised, staff excellent, got beds and towels for you, food and drinks served etc Medi Terra restaurant was fantastic service, please do go in here, it may look exclusive but everyone is welcome and my son loved the tapas, the cost is also very competitve - service and staff couldnt do enough for you Dont understand the bad reviews, okay there are some strange little things but these are…"
 March 2018,5,Excellent service...,"the hotel looked newly renovated (at least the rooms we were in) with a nice mix of modern and authentic style. we took suites and they were very spacious. service was super excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful and that includes house keeping, concierge and waiters at restaurants. the only downside though was the room service menu which was in french only and had only like 6-7 options to choose from. Nevertheless, there are few restaurants in the hotel to dine in. i highly recommend this hotel for families and couples."
 April 2018,3,Nobody around to help,"This is a beautiful hotel so it’s such a shame they don’t have the staff there to run it. My room was lovely and spacious with a stand-alone tub and separate living space. But the rooms are not sign posted at all. And nobody from reception takes you to your room in the vast complex, so it’s a miracle I found my room at all. Nobody on reception answers the phone. Nor room service. So I was unable to arrange breakfast before my 6am check out. Not a 5* hotel in my book. Wouldn’t go back."
 April 2018,4,"Beautiful Rooms, Understaffed",There are many 5 star things about this hotel --beautiful grounds with water features and nice pool --comfortable rooms including excellent linens (great pillows and towels). very comfortable bed --rooms with nice terraces --nice bathroom amenities --big spread at breakfast buffet --40 or so minute walk to main square and less than 10 minute walk to mall But the understaffing easily knocks off a star --huge line for eggs at breakfast. Another egg person is needed! --no one at either reception to be found. We got caught in the pouring rain on our walk back from the center and wanted to ask for an extra hair dryer or see if we could pay to get our clothes dried. Not one person in sight in either reception area. Earlier in the day we waited for ages for a concierge so we…
 April 2018,5,Opulent luxury-wow,Movenpick was a brilliant hotel! The room sizes were good and they had all the appliances you would need. There is also different languages in the entertainment so anyone can enjoy. We had a big balcony with a table for dining and the view was spectacular. The food was delicious. There was a lot of variety for anyone. The crockery was very clean as was the food itself. The breakfast and dinner had lots of fab options and I thoroughly enjoyed. The pools were of a massive size and the heated pool was just warm enough and not too hot. The cold pool wasn’t cold enough to freeze you but was still cold. Movenpick‘s location was just right with a mall next to it. It was an amazing hotel and I would recommend that you choose this one.
 April 2018,5,Excellent Service,Very nice staff. Extremely friendly. Especially Mustapha et Hanaa at breakfast. Will definitely be back. The room is very comfortable. Bed extremely nice too. Large choices for buffets. Highly recommended.
 March 2018,5,Magical Movenpick Marrakech,Such an amazing hotel with such amazing staff. Nadine .... was a staff member that made my holiday... multilingual.. smiley... service fabulous... I left my wallet and the same hour she returned it without a cent missing. She even refused the 100 euros I offered her. Where in the world do you find such trustworthy gems. Certainly a hotel on your must visit list. I never return anywhere but here... I will be back.
 November 2017,5,An Authentic Moroccan Charm,"This hotel is so nice. It’s absolutely huge. So many buildings, pools, restaurants within the complex as well as a very large and professional spa. Check in and check out was very quick and all the staff are very well spoken. Rooms are very spacious as well as a walk in closet and large balcony equipped with table and chairs The variety and quality of the food in the breakfast hall was one of the best I’ve seen so far. The location is perfect within the area of Hivernage which is known to have the best resorts/hotels, restaurants and stores Whilst there we visited the main square a few times, it’s only a few minutes drive from the hotel. Here you will find the never ending semarina souk In the evening we went to jad mahal and Buddha bar restaurant for dinner and…"
 April 2018,4,Great family hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Movenpick. The restaurants were great - particularly the breakfast buffet. All the pools were lovely and we had a very nice room. Special mention must go to the kids’ camp and their fantastic, friendly staff and amazing daily activities - our kids didn’t want to leave when they went there! Also very well located from airport and center."
 April 2018,5,Very helpful staff and great service,"Beautiful hotel, very opulent and spacious rooms. Have to mention the Kids Club was great, the girls Raouia andTouria were excellent with both my boys who had lot’s of fun while my husband and I went to the souks and wanted some time by ourselves. The breakfast spread is great although the coffee from the machines never seemed to be hot enough, but that’s a small inconvenience . Didn’t see any alcohol on any of their menus , so if you decide to buy your own make sure you also carry a bottle opener as they don’t have one at the hotel. (We borrowed one of the Staffs personal Swiss army knife that he happened to have). Other than these small glitches it was a wonderful stay is a fabulous hotel."
 April 2018,5,"Great Hotel, excellent serviceb and kids club","We had a great time, my daughter loved the kids club and their staff, she would go everyday to play and feed the rabbits :) restaurants are very good, one of the pools is warmed for the colder days, and the staff at the pool are so nice. I highly recommend!"
 March 2018,4,3 night stay - Honeymoon,Checked in for 3 nights having spent most of our time in a Riad. Comfort level is exceptional. A couple of useless people in reception which makes life difficult but overall our stay was perfect - I wouldnt stay here for over €150 per night
 March 2018,4,Plush hotel near centre of Marrakech,"Opulent hotel with huge suites, ours looking over the gardens. Enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend... helpful staff and delicious breakfast with a vast range of food. Dinner was a little limited, but that could have been to the time of year we visited (March 2018). Rooms a little walk from main hotel building, but a choice of four pools. Go for the Hammam Scrub!!"
 March 2018,1,Worst hotel ever !!! Gave a bad impression of Marrakech for visitors.,"First time ever in a Movenpick, it will definitely be my very last. I stay in hotels 80% of the time in a year and hotel by far is the worst of the worst. Service is extremely poor and rude on the service center hotline, I don’t care if you have 500 rooms as an excuse to find me a iron and ironing board and having 500 rooms you do not have enough for your guests? Or rather you think your guests would love to go out with wrinkled shirts and pants ? Totally unacceptable. Food. Breakfast was ok but don’t except good service. Rooms. Doesn’t deserve a 5 stars, I was pretty excited to visit at first after looking at all the pictures online. When I got into my room, wow I was shocked, fourpoint Sheraton or doubletree could do a better job. Don’t expect your Air condition to…"
 March 2018,5,AWESOME HOTEL AND NO.1 SERVICE.... MUST READ :),I and my wife would like to thank everybody at the Movenpick Marrakech for a wonderful stay we had here. From the minute we checked in to the day we left everybody was so attentive to all our needs. The suite was amazing and had everything required for a perfect stay with great comfort and services. Mr Khalid and the reception made every effort to ensure we where welcomed into our suite with VIP experience and Emmanuel ensured our dining experience in the restaurants were spot on throughout our 5 nights. The concierge where always on hand and ensured we had all the information required and assisted us not only during our stay but before arriving also. The Spa team (I forgot the names) where very helpful throughout are stay and always smiling and pleased for a pleasant chat if…
 March 2018,5,Magical Marrakesh,Wonderful visit for CAF Women's Football symposium in March 2018. Everything was surreal and like jumping out of a genie lamp!! Rooms and entire hotel so beautiful. Reception. Area mystical. Wonderful food with so much variety on menu. Bar with lovely music and chocolate snacks. Was like being in a dream!!! Thanks
 March 2018,5,So much better than I thought!,"Was apprehensive booking this hotel due to few bad reviews, but needn’t of Worried , the staff couldn’t do enough for you,my husband was gluten free and The found gluten free bread ! The standard room had a small problem so we were upgraded straight away To a really lovely room and bathroom,felt so comfortable there. I loved the pool, once again pool staff were there for your every need Breakfast great ,was in a very convenient position ,u can’t go wrong !"
 March 2018,3,All that glitters isn’t gold,"Initially we were super impressed with the hotel. The grounds were beautiful and dazzling at first glance but once you got pass the initial wow it goes down hill quick. The staff at the reception desk were moderately friendly but it was clear after residing there a few days that they were overworked. It appeared that one young lady was at the reception desk for a period of over 16 hours. Our first room, was less than what was expected for a 5 Star Hotel, especially since it took 4 years to renovate. On outside of the elevator doors, the dry wall was cracking and falling apart. The fine details were totally missed in this hotel and the rooms were lack luster. We had to change rooms three times because of the room conditions. One evening it took over 30 minutes for someone to…"
 March 2018,5,Warm in March,"We liked this hotel, it's a good 4*+ clean, well kept and modern. Our room 7208 was large and very comfortable with a big terrace balcony. Monster bath and multiple showers with ample pressure and hot water. 3 restaurants and 2 bars. It could be better: house keeping, tv channels and information about the hotel and services it offers."
 April 2017,2,Great hotel but disappointing,"I stayed here for 4 days last year as a relaxing end to 10 days spent climbing in the Atlas Mountains. The hotel is absolutely amazing, really clean and tidy with a very nice atmosphere and great facilities. The location is good also and within walking distance of both the new malls and food chains in one direction and the old town/ square in the other. The breakfast options and service was also excellent. However the hotel was let down by the staff. I was ignored/ left waiting to check-in likely due to coming straight from the mountains so being in scruffy clothes.. they then tried to make me pay upfront when I had already booked and paid via Amex. All in total it took around 30 mins to get checked in. This was evening and the following morning I noticed that despite…"
 March 2018,2,"Unusable WiFi, poor service and security","We stayed 2 nights in this beautiful hotel, but looks are deceiving. The WiFi in our room was unusable slow and unreliable- we told the front desk on our first day, and while they said they would address it, it was neither fixed nor did we hear back. Several rooms in our group experienced similar WiFi issues. On the second day, another group of friends checked in and they were given the room key to a stranger’s room. They found out when they saw a stranger’s luggage after brushing their teeth and using the bathroom. Needless to say, lock up your valuables in case the wrong people gets access to your room."
 March 2018,4,Enjoyable stay,"We've just returned from a family trip and had a good time, hotel was very nice and the coffee shop in particular was good with some very good service from the waiter named Mourad, was very personable and made a very good cappuccino. Overall the stay was pleasant but we did have some issues with what we were told about 2 excursions we booked with the hotel, seems the concierge and reception teams are not in sync and have their own people that they use for the trips and this caused confusion and some stress for us as we had to deal with the guides and drivers when what we had signed up to was different to what the tour people thought was agreed."
 February 2018,4,Nice hotel,"Clean rooms, very kind staff, good breakfast, strong wi-fi. The hotel is really OK. But take care! If you go beyond the standard services of the hotel, you have to prepared to be cheated - like everywhere in Morocco. Taxi was about 20 EUR from the airport, but back to the airport it was only 15 EUR. Concierge was saying a totally different amount. We ordered a private tour quide at the concierge and payed for it. At the end we got only a driver with a car but he was not a tour quide. Etc etc etc... Be prepared that you gonna be cheated each time wherever you go."
 February 2018,5,Birthday trip made special thanks to Safae & Khalid,"We got there and the welcoming part wasn’t as expected. However we were then introduced to Safae and Khalid who gave us an exceptional service and ensured to look after us the whole stay. Thanks to both my husbands birthday was a lot more memorable! Thanks for going the extra mile! I would recommend this hotel as a stay in Marrakech as it has a lot to offer, the interior and exterior is beautiful and well maintained and it’s a great location!"
 December 2017,3,Good location for corporate event,"Had large corporate event at the Moevenpick and all was arranged very well. Food, accommodations and presentation areas / ballroom were all up to high spec. It took participants a bit of time to get used to the confusing lay-out of the hotel but rooms were good and clean. Bar and pool area were also good. Only let-down was the slow service at the reception desk. They take way too much time to check-in and/or check-out guests. Nice place overall though."
 November 2017,5,Lads Holiday!,"Good hotel, friendly staff, lost my phone and cleaning hijabi lady and their supervisor helped find it! Clean rooms and facilities! Nice area with shopping mall, McDonalds, kfc and train station within walking distance."
 February 2018,4,Good modern hotel,"We stayed in this hotel because of attending a Congress next doors. It’s a big hotel where it takes some time to get to know the way. The rooms were nice with very comfortable beds and bathrooms. Our view was nothing and I believe a big part of the rooms doesn’t have a big view as it’s closed in by the other hotels. Breakfast was wonderful, very diverse and tasty. Nice was also that just 50 meters from the hotel are the Medina bikes that you can rent. There are several stations in Marrakech, mostly at the main attractions. This brings you quickly in the centre, nobody is bothering you and you don’t have the hassle with the taxi drivers."
 February 2018,1,Major Disappointment !!,Me & my wife went to Marrakesh for 9 nights for my birthday. We stayed at this Movenpick Hotel thinking we will be getting excellent service but apart from the birthday cake which the hotel provided I got to say we were let down from the start. As soon as we got to the hotel there was a problem in finding our booking so it was a good job I had my hotel confirmation with me and I showed this to the receptionist. Now to my shock I was asked to pay £160 deposit for the room even though I had already paid my hotel in full. I knew that I had to pay tourism tax for the hotel but this I wasn’t expecting and as I only brought cash with this had affected our holiday. When we got to the room I noticed stains on the toilet floor and also a water leak next to the toilet. I reported this but…
 February 2018,5,Brilliant Hotel,"I went with my wife in the first week of February for 5 days. Even though the weather wasnt as we expected (it was 8 degrees with some wind and rain) we made the most of it. It's in a good location away from the hustle and bustle, but within good within of the main attractions with taxi. The hotel decor was amazing and the rooms were clean. The buffet breakfast was spot on with plenty to choose from. The staff were very helpful whether it be the reception, cleaning staff or the restaurant staff. During our stay there was a Chocolate Hour at 6pm and wow the varieties/taste of chocolate were amazing. We asked for a room upgrade (to a suite) on the 2nd day and our request was accepted. The only thing that bugged me was when we first went to check-in, one of the receptionist was…"
 February 2018,3,Inconsistent service but beautiful hotel,"I recently went to Marakech for a girls trip, I went in Feb the weather was nice, it rained when we arrived but after this the weather picked up. I chose a hotel as I have stayed in a Riad before. When you arrive at the Movenpick the entrance is grand and the smells are lovely, the staff were friendly and easy to deal with. When we got to our rooms they were a good size we went for the king size bed. As our stay progressed we noticed many inconsistencies, our rooms were close to one another, however a few of us had slippers in the room, one so us had the extra pillows, another had a card detailing who to call in emergencies etc etc... as time went on we found differences in the ways the rooms were cleaned and fresh towels were not provided, a bath mat went missing,…"
 February 2018,5,Amazing!,"So, so impressed with this hotel and level of service. Beautiful views and room service is delivered with minutes. Only thing I could mark them down for is lack of English speaking staff but other than that phenomenal and will be visiting again."
 February 2018,1,The Moroccan Job!,"The last thing you would expect while traveling is getting robbed which is what exactly happened with me during my stay in the hotel. An amount of USD 1500 was stolen from my room(most likely by the House Keeping Staff) while i was out. To make matters worse, another burglary took place the very next evening with my colleague whose wallet, mobile and watch were stolen while he was sleeping inside the room. This clearly reflects the audacity of the people involved. After all this, the only expectation you have is for the Hotel staff to be supportive and get into investigating the events. However, the response was extremely disappointing and questions were raised whether the burglary actually took place. What is more shocking is that Movenpick does not even have a proper CCTV…"
 January 2018,5,Excellent service for a group reservation and event planning,"Excellent service and event planning for a group visit. I would like to recommend Ms. Hafsa Ait Ouarham, Meetings & Events senior Project Manager, who was our contact person at the hotel. She was very attentive during the course of the planning and flexible regarding sudden changes in the tight schedules."
 February 2018,4,Good enough,"I had to stay at this hotel for 3 nights, to attend our sales kick off meeting. The hotel is good enough to provide the Movempick standards, and to provide the comfort enough, the hotel is located near walking distance to restaurants and clubs, and provide full fledge for business case as it close to the conference Center."
 January 2018,2,A disappointment,"We stayed at the hotel for almost a week. For the sake of providing a fair and balanced review, I am sharing the positives and negatives: Positives: 1) the hotel looks stunning and has beautiful decoration. 2) an amazing house keeping lady whose name is Kareema. She was amazing as she was committed, dedicated and friendly. Our rooms were clean and we had everything we needed. Negatives: 1) Key chains: we had to request key cards every single day. This was the first time ever that I had to change keys so often. That was a major area of frustration. 2) Wi-fi/ TV problems: wi-fi was consistently poor/ bad and on some occasions you will not be able to join the Movenpick network. The last two days of our stays the TV would stop working for hours. You report the issue and…"
 September 2017,5,Everything is just awesome,"I would give it 5 star for its location, food and service. It's at walkable distance from Marrakech train station and well connected to Marrakech airport. We were around 30 people from India, Germany and US. It was a global team from Merck. The stay was arranged weeks back and we were well received. I'd never been to a star hotel earlier so this was a new experience. I had a nice room with a king size bed and everything was just perfectly arranged. The food was awesome. I loved the Moroccan cuisine. The staffs were very helpful and my 3 days of stay was filled with nice experience.Good job. keep it up."
 December 2017,3,Book a garden view room,"Our stay would have been excellent if we had booked a garden view room. The staff around the hotel are excellent: pool, restaurant, gym and bar. The receptionist are not very helpful. We had a superior king and did not get any sleep. It was the last room in the resort next to a man powered gate that opens all night long. It sounds like a train is going by. Reception was not help, telling us the rooms were all booked and we could not change rooms. Every night I would check and sure enough there were still superior rooms available--such a disappointment. We could not even use our terrace because security sits at the gate all day and all night."
 December 2017,4,"Very large and opulent, nice in winter","Some aspects of this hotel are completely amazing - like the entrance, and like sitting curled up in a dressing gown on a cold winter's evening as the sun sets. The place looks brilliant at night. The room was extremely comfortable, although at this price a bath would have been a justified extravagance. After the Holiday Inn where I'm writing this review from even has a tatty old bath. Pool heated in winter. Highly wonderful. Breakfast was actually very average, with limited selection of foods and receptionists were incompetent for check-out."
 December 2017,2,Poor service,The poorest hotel in service ever seen by myself. The concierge is just a tourist package salesperson who refuses to answer any questions but only to market the corny tourist trap hotel packages. She refused to answer our simple direct to the point questions as if we were interrogating her. Room service is great if they ever pick up the phone. The staff at the reception do not mind yhier own business and ask odd questions. The breakfast area was infested with bees. The spa is always busy and the staff are rude. Too many children shouting in the corridors and doors squeeking like a horror movie. If you don't tip the waiters during breakfast you can forget about the service. Understaffed hotel with nice decor.
 December 2017,4,return to Spa Ô de Rose,"Last Christmas holiday we stayed with the family in the Mövenpick hotel. Because it fulfilled all our expectations that one may have of a 5-star hotel, good accommodations, friendly staff, good food, etc. we considered staying here this year again during the Christmas holidays. For me personally, an absolute motive to revisit the Mövenpick were the treatments in the Spa of the hotel, and in particular that of Najia. Without exaggeration, she gave the best massage I had ever experienced. We decided to go again this year and again I have experienced some treatments in the spa Ô de Rose. Again a wonderful experience, one not to forget! Special thanks to Najia who, with her professional and delicious treatments, gives a sincere reason to return to Movenpick Marrakech!"
 November 2017,4,Comfy little oasis,"I really enjoyed this hotel. Rooms were quiet, clean, and comfortable. The grounds were absolutely beautiful with several quiet relaxing nooks tucked away -- you would never guess you were in the middle of a city. All the food I had was pretty darn good, especially the breakfast buffet and the Moroccan restaurant in the back. The location was fairly convenient -- there are plenty of options within a 15 minute walk, and the Medina was just a bit further. Even though some of the streets were quiet at night around the hotel, we didn't feel unsafe. Conference facilities were also great, and the Palais des Congres is one of the largest meeting rooms I've ever seen. Staff was friendly enough but I did not find them particularly helpful when I asked questions. Not bad, it's just…"
 December 2017,3,Very nice hotel but disappointing service,"We arrived at the Movenpick the evening of the 30th December, we were fascinated by the design of the hotel, the reception looks truly amazing. We had booked a room for three people (my husband, our daughter and me) but once in the room, we found out that the room was set up only for two people, there was no bed for our daughter, no towels for her and only one cup to make our tea or coffe. And the minibar was empty, despite being a pricelist. We called reception to ask for those things to be delivered to the room but nobody came while we were undoing our suitcases. So we decided to stop by reception on our way out to dinner to ask for those things again, as upon our return to the room we would need to have a shower and go to bed. On our return only the towels were there but no…"
 December 2017,5,Business an Pleasure with Uriage team Belgium!,"The hotel was very nice in every aspect. The rooms were big enough, clean and had a high comfort level with very good and soft beds. The staff was very professional, helpful and very kind. The best thing about the hotel was the food, we would definitely recommand the restaurant. The equipment and rooms we hired for our seminar were very professional and extended. They fulfilled all of our wishes. The Spa and heated swimmingpool heavenly to enjoy even in a colder month. Our next seminar in Morocco will be in this hotel again! Special thanks to meeting and events manager Hafsa Ait Ouarham for the best service, everything was taken care of meticulously and with the biggest smile! Uriage Belgium Sofie, Zoë en Nicolas"
 December 2017,5,Great place to be!,"Lovely hotel, half board option is good value, nice rooms and services, one of the best we have seen in Marrakech, only things to improve is wait and speed of check-in and internal telephone services need to answer more promptly, otherwise vers satisfied and thank you again! It's our favorite stop-over in Marrakech!"
 January 2018,3,Decent room / Poor service,"Service was poor like most places in Morocco. Though the room was spacious and nice. Staffs are very unprofessional. For instance, both my husband's and my access cards stopped working so we had to go to the lobby to get issued new ones. The staff does not even check your ID and gives you the new access cards right away and no explanation when we asked why cards stopped working. The next evening, same thing happened (which I find bizarre). We went down to the reception, the guy just reissued the card without checking our ID and no explanation. Water temperature knob in shower was broken so every 15 seconds, the temperature would change to super hot.. so I had to wash my hair and shower with one hand while the other hand is holding the temperature knob. Next time we will…"
 December 2017,3,Nice rooms but not a 5* hotel,Not sure we will come back.. The service level was very poor. Though the rooms and balcony was very nice. If we would come back to Marrakesh we would probably pay that little extra and stay at the Royal Mansour instead.
 September 2017,5,very good,Very nice hotel in Marrakech with fantastic swimming pools and gardens. We had a spacious suite and the location is perfect to relax but also to attend the PURE Show. Service is fine and restaurant are quite good. Spa should improve as the atmosphere is not so cozy. Excellent concierge service
 December 2017,5,Excellent,"Very nice room, frendly and helpfull staff, great pool area and gym. The hotel garden was beuatifull and serene. Varied, fresh and delicious breakfast. Appreciated the choclate tasting every day and the aerobic class with Aziz."
 December 2017,3,4 days without peaceful sleep,We are a family of 5 so had booked 2 superior rooms for a 4 night stay after reading excellent reviews. First impressions are great especially the reception areas and poolside. Had to walk to the end of the resort to find the rooms on 2nd floor of building no 7. No inter-connecting rooms available in this building so asked for rooms opposite each other - this was not possible as all sold out. Had to make do with two rooms on same floor facing a busy road with a night club. Stayed up most nights with noise of metal garage door opening and shutting every 15 to 20 minutes - sounded like sound of metal shutters being shut next to the windows. Some nights also noise from night club traffic. Nothing was done about the garage doors despite complaining numerous times and room…
 December 2017,5,Day spa visit,"I spent half a day at the Cinq Mondes spa after a couple of days walking in the Atlas Mountains. It was phenomenal! The spa is beautiful and the staff enhance the experience. Mr Bennani, one of the hotels managers, personally checked on me which impressed me. Next time I’ll be staying at the hotel too. World class!"
 November 2017,5,Nice hotel,"Hotel is very nice, the lobby, swimming pool. We also like walk-in shower :) Great breakfast with live cooking, dozens of croissants and hazelnut cream :) One disadvantage of that place is its location. For people without kids I think its not a problem, but for us with a stroller it was a little bit too far away from all sights. All curbs are so high that walking with a stroller is almost like a gym :) Our son got sick and they helped us a lot. Very nice man from the staff (unfortunately I dont know his name, but I think he was a manager) organized a doctor within 20 minutes. In that kind of situation everything what is wrong becomes less important. We are so grateful to him for that."
 December 2017,4,"Good service, hotel too large","I spent one night at the Movenpick. The room was large,clean and recently renewed. The service was nice and the SPA ok. The hotel is so large that you get lost. Nice for business conventions. The location of the hotel is great."
 December 2017,5,Excellent position and excellent staff,Hope to come back again there At marakech And Specially at Movenpick With their fantastic swimming pool And near by rests The workers all very kind with good smile and helpful . Recomend it Highly Thanks
 December 2017,5,Excellent,Excellent place with very hospitable team in the restaurant amuse by the breakfast 🍳 with ibtessam we share its work on facebook and if available to attach screen shots from our posts i will make that ask about IBTESSAM when you reach to the restaurant at breakfast 🍳 also another female chef at the luanch also so hospital girl and so cute 🍎🍎
 December 2017,5,Great Hotel,"We had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel recently. All restaurants and bars are good, and staff attentive and helpful. The ‘turn down’ staff were particularly friendly (my wife had a cold), and I enjoyed ‘chocolate hour’. Oh also full marks for a great breakfast. PS It’s a bit too far to walk to the old town from this hotel, but only £5 taxi fare (make sure seatbelts are there!)."
 December 2017,4,splendid hotel,"great place to stay and enjoy quiet time. swimming pool is perfect, spa is very nice, food is awesome, and lying in bed feels as you were lying in a cloud. Wifi in some bedrooms is sometimes not very quick, but network engineer Najib was always available and willing help us with each issue and request. he was perfect!"
 December 2017,4,An excellent place for business events,Very nicely decorated modern hotel with excellent facilities for congresses. Maybe having meeting rooms with daylight would be better. Being in a sunshine place and not seeing the sun is a little bit a shame... But everything was very good.
 November 2017,5,Immaculate hotel and Impeccable Staff,"Movenpick Marrakech was an absolute delightful and fantastic hotel. All the staff are very happy and content in the work that they are doing, which makes the guests also feel happy and content. The restaurants in the hotel are fantastic, and provide an excellent quality of food and service. The breakfast area is immaculate, and there was always someone to tend to your needs. The quality,quantity and variety offered at breakfast is second to none. It's not just the facilities and location that makes a great hotel, its mainly the people. There were a number of people that made us feel like we were at home, and gave us a homely feel, and I would like to call out these people. Mr Amin for arranging the whole experience from our stay's start to finish. Mr Khalid Mowlad, who gave us…"
 November 2017,5,Great place to stay,This was the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in. We stayed in building 4 which gives you an idea of its size. The buffet breakfast was included in the price. If I were to go back to Marrakech I would likely stay there again.
 December 2017,5,Nice hotel with helpfull staff,"Hotel is very nice, the lobby, swimming pools. We also like our walk-in shower :) Great breakfast with live cooking, dozens of croissants and hazelnut cream :) One disadvantage of that place is its location.

 November 2017,5,Excellent Royal services,Spent 5 days in this beautiful Palace with wonderful service and friendly staff. Im humbled and will return again also recommend this as a great stay while in Marrakech~location is accurately placed in the center of almost everything~
 November 2017,3,"Fantastic, but my visit was ruined..","Mixed feelings about this hotel. The decor is amazing; it won’t let you down. Definitely luxurious. The ground staff (waiters, concierge etc) are incredibly friendly. The rooftop bar and the pool areas are all amazing. This hotel spells luxury. Breakfast is amazing; the range is fantastic. A special shoutout goes to my friend Safae who helped me to find places to eat outside of the hotel and made my stay comfortable. However, there is also a lack of professionalism which exists within the management of this hotel. The rules and regulations are atrocious and totally illogical. I had booked a Junior Suite and requested for my friend to come and visit me. We wanted to plan our days together and I thought we could sit in the living room and do this. However, to my dismay and shock…"
 November 2017,5,Beautiful hotel with many amenities,"I stayed at the Movenpick for 11 days in November, while attending a meeting. The grounds were lovely and open, the room was very nice with no troubles, and the restaurants were good. Breakfast was very good, also. The gym was well equipped. I did not use the spa. Although it is a few minutes from the old city, which I had hoped to stay closer to before arriving, it was easy to get there. I would stay at this hotel again, as would my wife who accompanied me for part of the trip."
 November 2017,5,One of the best hotels handsdown 5*****,"This hotel was unbelievably beautiful has to be one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at, customer service was it 10 out of 10 and the room was a 15 out of 10 just unbelievable words cannot describe how good this hotel is. I’ve been to a lot of hotels not just to brag but this has to be in my to top 5."
 November 2017,4,Great stay in Marrakech,"Very Good Hotel, Good and big rooms and nice service! I enjoyed the stay in that great Hotel very much and really would like to come back. I had a good time and the service of the hotel was very good!"
 October 2017,5,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel, clean and very comfortable rooms... very nice breakfast. The restaurants in the hotel are also very good. The staff: most are very good, few are average. I would stay again in this hotel."
 November 2017,4,Over-the-top opulence,"Traveled here for work. The hotel is excessively opulent. Everything gleamed and glowed and was illuminated. Grounds were beautiful and the rooms were spacious, clean, modern and comfortable. This is a very high end hotel. My only reservation is that the meals provided to us in the restaurant (I was attending a very large conference in the adjoining conference center) were reptitive and not very exciting."
 October 2017,5,Lovely Venue,"Marrakech is a wonderful destination which has all kinds of options for accommodation. The Movenpick Hotel Mansour is a place to go to be pampered, a bit out of the center but close enough to enjoy what the city has to offer. The main square and old quarter is a very short cab ride. The hotel could not be nicer and has choice of dining, pool, spa and what you would expect from a deluxe resort. The staff is friendly and helpful. It is priced so that even those on a budget might want to splurge a few nights."
 November 2017,1,Horrible staff and disgusting room,"My first time in Marrakech and wanted to stay in a nicer hotel to help familarizing the city. Little did I expect such mediocore front desk service from a 5 star hotel. The staff barely speaks any English, totally ignored people waiting online to check in, they all have similar ""do not ask me question"" expression when I first checked in and subsequently when I approached the front desk asked questions about the city or hotel facilities. The worst part is the room they gave us was in horrible shape. First they gave us a room with horrible sewage smell as soon as we opened the door, then there was strong cooking smell from the restaurant next building when we open the bacony window. When I explained the problem to the front desk, they did not even bother to apologize, just…"
 September 2017,5,"Attend a conference ""Creditinfo""","Excellent place, nice and clean. Just at two blocks from Ménara Mall and near Marrakech Medina. Modern rooms and nice Gym, the restaurant with excellent international food and local food. Security 100% you feel secure all time inside or outside, nice people in Morocco"
 November 2017,3,Nice setting - bad spa,I found the spa experience to be below par and overpriced. The room I was given was next to a noisy elevator. There were some good things about this hotel.... the staff were lovely and very welcoming and helpful and the setting is gorgeous .... but the whole spa experience was disappointing for what it was
 November 2017,3,Lovely hotel but rooms are a bit basic,"I stayed in this hotel for a conference this month. While the public areas are very luxurious, the bedrooms are a bit basic! I had to change rooms after a day because the shower leaked so badly it was flooding the carpet in my bedroom! When I went to lock the security chain on my door in the second room, it just came off the wall!! To be fair though, reception fixed it immediately and there were no further issues with it. The pool is lovely and warm and the breakfast selection was great. As a vegetarian the other dining options were quite limited. Service could be quite hit and miss. Reception didn't believe me when I said my phone wouldn't make outgoing calls, the TV didn't always work but had no English language entertainment channels, the TV would turn on every night…"
 November 2017,5,The best experience i’ve ever had in Morocco! Can’t wait to return,The hotel is amazingly decorated! The restaurant and staff are amazing! Mohammad made sure my preferred drink was always available! The cleaning staff was pleasant and Abdeslam Jeldi made sure that my room was comfortable and welcoming.
 November 2017,5,Great stay,"We stayed in this top rated hotel for two nights. Although the standard rooms are a bit small they are still very well presented. The room is very clean, modern and one of the best hotels in town for the money. Breakfast was excellent with many options."
 November 2017,2,"Nice hotel, but not so great service","I stayed in this hotel in relation to a conference taking place there. It is a very nice hotel, nice surroundings and nice setup. The quality of the service and of the front desk is below average. Food and bar are nice and good, but again let down by poor service. Very mixed experience."
 November 2017,5,I recommend,Good location excellent staff and service very clean good restaurants nice place to stay in recommend for couples and family's room was so clean and comfortable just the WiFi was fair and need more chanel for kids
 November 2017,3,Good but still some work has to be done,"Room was dirty, WiFi connection without coverage in my room, fridge not working, minibar empty. On the other hand - fantastic swimming pool, very good breakfast, great bar and very good staff. It's a good hotel but it needs some procedures to control the shape of rooms before checking guests."
 November 2017,3,"Great hotel, outstanding bad staff!","Very nice hotel, pool and spa ! but the staff overall is not worth the five stars!!!, room maids knocking on door at 0700 walking in the room etc, an absolut nogo! very disappointing (happened twice) concierges: only one guy up to the job. (friday, 17.11.17,10.30 am) all others not up to the job! restaurants and bars seem to occupy people that dont know their job. A no-returner!"
 November 2017,4,czaja,"There is nothing bad to say about the hotel.rooms are quiet. There is excellent mattress, bathroom and room was clean, and cleaned up each day.. swimming pool was clean also.staff is friendly. breakfast was good."
 October 2017,5,Great experience,"It’s realy a great hotel, clean, friendly personnel, beitiful landscape, very nice pool, well furnished, I realy advice all who comes to marrakish to use this hotel, and for me, I am planning to have a family trip to Marraksh, and will have Mövenpick as my address there."
 October 2017,4,"Decent, chained 5 ish star","It’s a big hotel. Entrance impressive. Public areas neat, tidy and well presented. Two main pools which look inviting but unfortunately are freezing cold so were quite unusable which is a pity. Booked junior suite which was actually a one bedroom suite with separate lounge and bedroom. Well furnished with very nice bathroom and terrace. Turndown was hit and miss. Breakfast standard affair. Nothing spectacular. As it’s a big hotel, it’s busy at breakfast and has a cafeteria type feel. Had buffet dinner one night. Ok, nothing special. Overall it’s what I would rate a good 4 Star. It’s not Deluxe. Service was hit and miss and surly at times in the restaurants and by the pool."
 November 2017,4,overpriced,"good hotel, high prices, poor staff. A big hotel , very nic, but services are poor and expensives.Marrakech is not either Europe, neither Dubai.. .. I asked a city map at lobby and they said ..We don t have. A Probably I don t recommend this hotel"
 November 2017,2,"Large hotel, poor service","A huge, well decorated place with an exceptionally beautiful pool (especially at night). But the service didn't measure up to the standard expected of this kind of hotel. It started with a cumbersome check-in process, slowed down by understaffing and inefficiency. Getting an ironing board to the room took several calls (first response: ""I don't have someone to send""). And the staff at the pool and bar was inattentive. Also, the wifi is very erratic and the breakfast ain't great. I think there are better options in town!"
 October 2017,5,Family stay end of October,"We went four days for a family trip in Marrakech. Mövenpick hotel is very nice, and convenient. The gardens are beautiful, breakfast is very good, as well as the moroccan restaurant. It would be perfect if the pool was heated :)"
 November 2017,4,Excellent hotel.,"Hotel is clean, friendly staff, good food, great location, beautifull hotel. Down side, high prices for alcohol and slow internet connection. WIFI not strong enough for e-mail, Netflix and Facetime/Skype."
 October 2017,4,Review,"I don´t have anything to add really after I filled out this survey. But it was a really beautiful stay and we enjoyed ourselves a lot. But, the wifi should be better because it was really slow and poor which is annoying."
 October 2017,4,Weekend Stay,Oversized Hotel but because it does spread out in area it does give an unusual warm feeling. Perfect for travelers that do not want to have trip with very close encounters with the local flavors with all the pros and cons that this implies. Excellent for families with small children.
 October 2017,5,Our second home,"What can we say, this hotel has become our second home! Every time we have been to Marrakech this has been our go to place, the hotel has made us feel comfortable, catered to all our needs and have treated us like one of them. We will definitely be back next year! Firstly we would like to say a massive thank you to some of the staff starting with: Ayoub What can we say, Ayoub was so caring and attentive to our needs, he made us feel like we are one of a kind! Always smiling and always happy and for that we thank him so much, he is one of the reasons why we will come back to the hotel. He is very professional and always makes sure our drinks/food was there pronto!. Hamza He was always willing to please and will go out of his way to make sure the service was perfect for us,…"
 October 2017,5,Exceptionnal,"this hotel is a real 5 stars, the quality of the employees and the decoration of the lobby is just amazing The breakfast is very good and very complete. The sunbeds are very good and comfortable i will recommand it for sure to my friends."
 October 2017,5,Movenpick,"Great hotel and would recommend to all. Located centrally with access to the main square and local to shops and restaurants. Greater service, food is excellent and facilities are very nice. The main swimming pool is stunning but unfortunately not heated. There is also a spa unit which not busy and provides a relaxing experience. Would also recommend the kids' club. There are three restaurants on site."
 October 2017,5,Great,"Beautiful, relaxing environment. The experience was great. We enjoyed the breakfast as family. Staff were helpful. Very clean. Only one thing early morning (6:30am) breakfast buffet set up was delayed which was slightly disappointing."
 October 2017,5,Exceptional,"We decided on a quick half term break. The food was very good, especially breakfast. The room we all had were deluxe, the bed gave us all the best sleep we have had in a hotel. All the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Sun loungers around the pool were the best we have had, better than the Burj in Dubai ! Couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Tried rebooking straight away and no availability !"
 October 2017,5,Family vacation,"Overall great vacation, wonderful location and friendly staff. Good buffet breakfast, nice spa/hammam. Room was clean, private hotel not noisy. Shisha was good st night on rooftop lounge. Penthouse was very spacious and loved the private pool"
 October 2017,5,Good experience,"Very good hôtel very welcoming ng staff, helpful and smiling all the times . The food was excellent and luxurious rooms, the issue is that some rooms are not far from noisy machines ( not sure what it was) the AC in the conference room was also so noisy that we should put it off Very good in general"
 October 2017,4,Very good experience,"In gneeral terms, it was a very good experience. The check-inn procedures should be improved; it took too long, too many information was requested, but in exchange for very little information or no information at all about the hotel, the city, etc."
 October 2017,5,very nice stay,"good hotel,nice restaurants but no so good service specially on the Mediterranean Restaurant... Breakfast was good but there was little offer on fruits on the buffet....Not easy to find your room,since is a very large hotel..."
 October 2017,4,A beautiful hotel in Marrakech,"The Hotel location is perfect for business and leisure. The minute you enter you feel you are at a Moroccan palace. The architecture, the decorations and even the smell are Moroccan. Hotel facilities are very nice. Staff is very friendly and food is great. The rooms are not as beautiful as the Hotel and they definitely need some maintenance and renovation. The furniture is modern but the colors are not attractive. Beds are comfortable."
 September 2017,4,panduit forum,Staff are friendly and services are good Other than the just one of the two passenger lifts that seemed to have some minor mechanical issue (door closing too soon) everything else was excellent. Air conditioning system in the rooms is very efficient. Hotel location is serene dinner and the dancers give me a unique experience.
 October 2017,4,Great hotel,"Very good hotel in the city. It has local architecture with modern room decorations and all amenities. The bathroom is very nice, the room is spacious. There are two outdoor swimming pools. The food is great too. The hotel is very big scattered in several buildings, so you may get lost."
 October 2017,4,Great setting beautiful **** Suggest Staff might need some training,"Attending a conference next door I stayed for 4 nights at the hotel. My first room 3325 was disaster terrible smell coming from room, reception and maid service unable to deal with it, opening windows, spraying something all to no avail. Moved rooms for the second night all is well. Very slow check-in and very slow if you needed any help from reception they seemed to spend a lot of time talking (and shouting) to each other to be avoided if possible. Maybe its a local way of communicating because the bar staff also spoke and shouted at each other, something not often seen in European hotels. The food was excellent including breakfast great selection and fantastic setting. There is a small cafe type place near the front which sells very nice food one particular person I think her…"
 October 2017,3,Not moved at movenpick,"Stayed at Movenpick Mansour for 5nights and it wasn’t all that. A very big hotel, so be prepared for the walk from reception to your room, in the most part out in the sun. For such a big hotel, the rooms were actually not as big as indicated. Appears more suited for conferences than family breaks. Buffet meals had a good variety to choose from at breakfast and dinner and the service there was ok though the staff often times appeared overwhelmed. Housekeeping was quite good and our chamber lady, Najal was very prompt and made sure our room was always tidy. Ordering coffee and cake at the cafe was good but be prepared to wait a while as they might have to go all the way to the restaurant to get the cake. Taxis are in abundance right outside the hotel and you hardly have to wait…"
 October 2017,1,Not up to Movenpick Standard,Staff kept chatting even though I walked up to the reception. This created a very bad first impression. The first room was very far from the reception and the pool view was non-existent because palm fronds blocked the view. Room had a bad smell so was moved to a room that had a blank wall as its view. Could not connect to hotel wifi and reaching the reception from the room was almost impossible.
 October 2017,2,All about fake / Terrible service,"Located in the Hivernage district and neighboring the convention center of Marrakech, this hotel has in theory a lot to offer for anyone on a business or leisure trip in Marrakech The reality is totally different: the service is terrible and specifically inefficient, extremely slow and light years away from the basics of customer service The bathrooms in rooms (we tried several rooms after complaints, all the same) are wrongly designed so that the water will flood your room rather than going the drain way. Every single request takes hours to be dealt with, probably because of incompetence more than bad will. There is enough choice in Marrakech to go elsewhere Not recommended"
 September 2017,4,Lovely staff made our visit special,We spent a relaxing week enjoying the pools and the food. The spa treatments were great. Our holiday was made enhanced by the excellent service provided by Nadine in the bar and Khalid who was always smiling and polite when delivering our room service.
 October 2017,1,Worst hotel ever !! Don’t go there,"Stayed at the Movenpick, for a getaway weekend to chill and relax I am very dispointed in all possible ways. 1st the rooms are tiny, the minibar is empty and when we called the reception for bottles of water, no one was answering. We had to go down to get them. The service is very bad: no menu if you wanna have lunch by the pool. U need to go all the way to the chalk board to read what’s on the menu. We left the room at 9am, by noon the room wasn’t made... never going back there !"
 October 2017,4,Nice hotel,"While I did read the negative reviews after staying here, most seemed service related and I must admit language a big issue for English and getting things done. Nice modern hotel, mini bar empty, hotel restaurants(3) are expensive...lunch buffet 32€ and no option for menu ordering...excellent buffet choices for all meals. 3 restaurants nearby by, but not high quality..however you can get anywhere by taxi for less that 8€. Beautiful pool and outdoor restaurant but , 18.5€ for a hamburger. Lobby and sitting areas beautiful and clean. Worthless screening system at door..alarm always goes off. But our visit was flawless with patience for language issues."
 September 2017,5,Total Luxury,"My friend and I stayed here to celebrate my 30th Birthday and I was surprised on arrival with an amazing chocolate cake in the room and every staff member we encountered were super friendly and wished me a happy birthday. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and super clean, the room was big with lots of space and the bed was really comfortable. The coffee shop is really nice as well and the service there was great. The breakfast was lovely and contained a great selection, the mint tea was delicious! Can't wait to go back!"
 August 2017,5,"Wow, amazing hotel","Visited this hotel last month for a work conference & stayed for 2 nights. This is a beautiful hotel, the rooms are very large as is the bathroom. Decorated beautifully. Lovely robe & slippers, safe in room & a fridge. Lovely pools with super comfortable sunbeds. Can't complain about the food either, buffet style breakfast & lunch. Never ate dinner in the hotel. The conference area in the hotel was very well thought out aswell. Staff all seemed very pleasant and helpful."
 October 2017,4,Amazing Hotel,"Movenpick was located in a beautiful location in Marrakesh. Very clean and tourist friendly - (apart from the few stares here and there maybe cos of my skin color). Food was great, ambiance was great. The only problem was that the bar wasn't well stocked and the barman took about an hour to make one cocktail, making it frustrating. They also mostly only speak french or arabic and that made it hard to communicate to house keeping, waiting staff etc. My mini bar was not stocked (even after request). The rooms are spacious and beautiful. However, I would still recommend this hotel."
 September 2017,5,Amazing hotel,"Visited this hotel for my friends 30th and could not have been more pleased. The staff were so eager to help and everyone was so friendly . The hotel itself is stunning and impeccably clean, the attention to detail is amazing from the red roses in reception to the petals being on the bed each day . I had contacted the general manager before our visit to inform him it was a special occasion we were visiting for and when we got to our room there was a birthday cake waiting for my friend was such a nice touch. We will be looking to go back asap!"
 June 2017,5,Splendid hotel,"This hotel is ideally located, and is stunning. There are several restaurants to choose from including a morrocan, mediterranean and a buffet. Staff are friendly. There is a business room with a computer and printer so that you can print off your boarding passes or other important needs. There is a large swimming pool in the heart of the complex. The breakfast is out of this world, with fresh soups and fruit and the usual cooked variety. Beautifully cut fruit and fresh mint tea."
 September 2017,5,Great place,"Spent five nights at the Movenpick in Marrakech. Our junior suite was very large and comfortable. It was clean; the bed was very comfortable; the bathroom was large and modern; the room had all the equipment we needed. Breakfast was superb and service was excellent. The hotel has several pools and is conveniently located between the airport and the medina. In short it was a lovely stay. By the way, the price was quite reasonable. We shall definitely return."
 September 2017,5,Excellent hotel and service,"This hotel is great! I was excited to leave a review here because I was so impressed with the service provided. All the employees at Movenpick are the most friendly and helpful people, they are so lovely. There was a day when I was ill and one of the managers of the hotel wanted to know if I and my family were fine, we had told him how we were feeling and he immediately assisted us. He took care of us in the lobby and ordered tea and water bottles. We met two managers of the hotel, unfortunately, I was not able to take their names, they were both so approachable and lovely and made sure we were happy with our stay. Everything about the hotel was exceptional, and I don’t give praise lightly. It was clean, stylish. The room itself was well equipped and comfortable. The bedroom…"
 September 2017,5,Definitely staying here again!!!,"What an absolutely beautiful hotel, the grounds are beautiful, gardens, pools, facilities....there is not one thing I can fault about this hotel. 10mins drive to Marrakech centre, 15mins drive to the airport. The lead in classic rooms are absolutely gorgeous with lovely big bathrooms. I visit Marrakech regularly and this for sure will be one I will be staying in again!"
 September 2017,4,value for money,"we had to go to the Palais des Congrés for business and as this is next to the Movenpick, ideal for this. we reserved a suite and this was very good for the price we paid for. A lot of space to work also.."
 September 2017,5,Great hotel,"Fabulous service at the restaurants and the hammam! I hope to go back. In particular, the food at Medi Terra and Dahbi was fantastic. Friendly staff, lovely pool area, especially at the small, quiet pool."
 September 2017,3,A fair room for the price. Wifi and Keycards a big pain.,"We stayed in room 3301 and 3309 for a business trip. The wifi didn't work in most places in the room (front door and tv only) and the keycards lost their magnetism too easily when in contact with your phone or wallet. With the room so far away from the front desk it was a pain to always have new keycards scanned for you. Other than that, the rooms were clean and well kept. The service especially at breakfast was awesome - I highly recommend getting a omelet from the lady there."
 September 2017,1,Movenpick Marrakech the disaster that Mr. Chavy knows,My comments are really clear. One of my worst hotel experiences ever. Many useless employees with any idea about the SOP of the hotel. Area manager treating their colleagues like slaves. Absurd guest experience strategy and horrible damage for the brand Movenpick.
 September 2017,3,Pure Life !!,"Just returned from 5 day stay which unfortunately coincided with a large (very large) event going on. No prior notice of any likely issues, even on check in, but having to queue through ""security"" at the buffet lunch by the pool made you feel like your business was not important, I just want to get to my room. Talking of the pool, the same large group took over the pool complex for four of the five days, it was closed to the ""outsiders"". Albeit they did note placed under some room doors on the day it closed. Lack of drawers in the rooms, wifi hit and miss in the rooms (if only you could sit by the pool!) others in our party had poor A/C. Finally got to sit by the pool on my final pm before my flight home, and the sprinklers came on! Guess it just wasn't my week. So you could…"
 August 2017,4,Very Good,Amazing location for families and couples. many things to do and explore. I rather enjoyed going out in the evening or late nights in the market for a buzzing and fun experience. very friendly people. I would recommend the hotel.
 September 2017,5,Best hotel in Marrakesh,"I had a wonderful stay with a group from Sweden. Rooms really nice, service perfect, breakfast wonderful. They only small problem was that the waiter did not understand well english at breakfast. If I asked for capuccino I got normal coffee with milk. But that is not a big problem"
 September 2017,5,Stay at MovenPick,"Really fantastic time. Would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. They're very receptive to your needs and willing to do whatever you need to make the stay fantastic. We were there for a business event and all of that went very smoothly as well. Also, there is a FANTASTIC exercise room."
 September 2017,5,Beautiful,"Visited this hotel for a few days for work. This place is stunning. Had a massive bedroom, wardrobe had a robe and slippers, there was a safe aswell. Massive bathroom with lots of lovely toiletries. The hotel was all marble and beautiful chandeliers. The pool looked lovely although I didn't use it. There was pool towels provided and very luxurious sunbeds. Food was very good, plenty of choice in the buffet. Staff were friendly. The conference area was really nice, very comfortable seats. The air conditioning was very good which was important as the temperature was in the 40s."
 August 2017,4,Lovely Experience,"Lovely stay, fantastic staff, slow internet at times and long waits for food or drinks orders to arrive, however most staff went out of their way to make you feel welcome and give you a helping hand. would definitely go back."
 July 2017,5,WSC ISI 2017,The services at hotel was excellent. I love the chocolate hour offered to hotel guests during my stay. I would also like to thank the hotel staff that was willing to provide us with an early breakfast on our the morning when we had to check-out by 6am in morning in order for us to be at the airport to catch a morning flight from Marrakech.
 September 2017,5,excellent,"excellent on the exception of the towels missing in the room, after requiring them , we received only the bigger ones and not the small ones....but in general and honestly speaking great service. Good luck"
 August 2017,3,Very good location but poor service,"Still waiting for a copy of the invoice 3 weeks after my stay at the hotel. When I checked out the system was not working, I was promised to receive it the day after. But nothing happended. Everytime I phone the hotel, they say they will do it immediately but nothing happens. I am very disappointed."
 September 2017,4,Enjoyed my stay at hotel,"A few issues but overall very nice hotel in a great location walking distance to Gileaz Good breakfast choices and included in the price was a pleasant surprise. Kids loved the hotel. A few issues: Fridge not working, iron not available despite asking a few times."
 August 2017,4,Movenpick Marrakech,"A nice setting in the new town away from the madness of the Medina was great for us as a family wanting a city break / time by the pool. Close to a mall for western style restaurants and a carrefour. Bear in mind you will need taxis to get to the medina etc - it wasn't far but in the heat you will want a taxi most times you go out. Pros - smart, clean hotel, nice pools, Moroccan restaurant v good Cons - service slow to non existent, housekeeping poor (had to keep asking for towels and even toilet rolls!), loud music by the large pool was overpowering. Spa overpriced and rubbish treatments"
 August 2017,5,Great experience!,"The experience was wonderful. The hotel itself is so beautiful. The location is awesome, 10 mins drive to the Medina and 3 mins drive to the train station. Walk to the train station and new city is 15 mins. Absolutely recommended"
 August 2017,5,Great hotel for families,"Newly renewed hotel. Very clean, friendly service, great large rooms and excellent restaurants. Nice pool area. One with music and the other to relax with kids. Attached to the congress center. Good location Good price quality value!"
 August 2017,1,Very strong problems,"The worst part: my room wasn't clean at all... A strong smell of smoking in the room from smoking smell in the room (very bad, it felt I was in a club). Long black hairs in the bathroom and in the bad (I'm blonde). The swimming pool was very dirty and they allow people and children to dive. So every 5 minutes you end up getting all wet... They allow people to drink and eat in the pool, that's so rong for many reasons. The worst pool ever, they let kids take their water toys and sorts of things into the pool, and this is a 5 star hotel?! You should fired the pool manager. The breakfast is very poor on service, higiene and selection of food. One of the employees made several times bad comments of me to another employee (Discrimination). Another employee gave me a dirty spoon…"
 August 2017,5,Great holiday!,I travelled to Marrakesh with my two daughters for a seven nights holiday! We had a lovely relaxing break. The hotel decor is beautiful with friendly staff and lovely food. We would definitely visit again!
 July 2017,5,A trip to remember!,Everyone has been very friendly with us in Marrakech Mövenpick Mansour Eddahbi & Palais des Congrès . The decoration was fantastic. The best has been the staff which was very efficient. The only nehative point has been the cards to enter the room which were not working most of the times.
 August 2017,3,So many things to improve,"Hi there! The lobby and the entrance of the hotel has a touch of grandeur and opulence, but that's all that is to say. In another place of the world this hotel round be a 4*. Very poor service, the breakfast is really bad (no tags to the identity the juices, no coffee spoons, very poor service, very poor quality and the staff is very rude). It was included in my booking but I did went out to have breakfast far from that poor breakfast hotel. The worst part is the swimming pool... NO RULES, they allow people to dive, people eating in the swimming pool, kids jumping all over, showering everybody in their chairs... Cigarette bits all over the place, food, toys, plastic bags, you named, everything was in the water... Only one guy from the staff was very kind and helpful, the rest?…"
 August 2017,3,Nice hotel but....,"Monsieur manager, for the love of God turn the music down by the pool! Wife and I like to rave as much as the next couple, but, as we reported to you personally yesterday, you've got sweary, night club loud music all day long at the pool. Are you trying to replicate Ibiza? That's not what the clientele sat round here look like they want. Cheers"
 August 2017,4,Perfect hotel,"Nice hotel with great location, good for relaxation they just need to work more on costumer services and improve the Staff skills when it come to dealing with issues and problems to meet the 5 starts hotels standards , I recommend this hotel for visitors 👍"
 August 2017,5,FAMILY VACATION,Very lovely and comfortable hotel. Very reasonable food prices . Beautiful environment . Very helpful and friendly staff ....So clean .Good for families with swimming pools and kids play ground .... Very safe with security check ...
 July 2017,4,"Clean, comfortable, relaxing","This is a nice hotel, well situated, with large and clean rooms, nearly of luxury standards overall. The swimming pool looked great as well. Breakfast was fine, although the young cooks need some more training in order to learn how to make fried eggs properly... The service at the bar of the hotel was extremely slow. The concierge assistance for getting a taxi can be very tricky! Pay attention! Make sure that what you are told by the concierge is the same amount you agree with the taxi driver! Otherwise the taxi driver will ask you for the double (of what the concierge told you that you are going to pay). Anyway, the situation with taxi fares in Marrakech is unacceptable/ one of the most negative issues hurting tourism. The authorities need to look at it seriously!"
 July 2017,2,Stay somewhere else where there's more value for your money.,"if you're new in a place, just book in a hotel for one day and then try to walk around and you'll get more value for your money. This is just one of those fancy hotels would very nice façade and lobby but you cannot expect the same when it comes to service. very poor. and breakfast is definitely better elsewhere"
 July 2017,4,Great Stay @ Movenpick,"We had a great stay here at the Movenpick. To summarise...the location is perfect as you are 10 mins from all the places you want to be: Jemaa El Fna Square, Jardin Marjorelle, Ben Youssef Mosque the list goes on. The thing we liked most is you were able to be in by hustle and bustle very quickly but equally we in the relaxation of your hotel very quickly. Two people we want to mention in particular are Ayoub in the Jamra bar and grill: looked after us all week nothing was too much for him. Abdelhaq in concierge answered all our questions and organised a couple of trips with no problems. The reason I have rated this 4 not 5 is there a couple of improvements I think could be made and they are only small: show you round the hotel when you arrive and make sure everything was good…"
 July 2017,3,Review,"This was a lovely beautiful hotel to stay at. All the ladies at the spa were amazing. So friendly, professional and made me and my sister feel very comfortable with the treatments we chose. I would definitely come again for the spa. Our room was lovely and breakfast was very good too. Although the staff at breakfast were quite rude. I asked for some breakfast to be taken up to our room for my sister and niece and was told no one could take it up for me. I felt they were very rude every time. This is the reason I am giving 4 stars. Need better staff , but the ladies and the hairdresser at the spa are amazing."
 July 2017,4,Beautiful big hotel,"Beautiful new hotel, having re-opened 6 months ago. Our one-bedroom suite was large and lovely. The hotel is very big, so the walk from our room to the main building was almost a quarter mile, but that goes past 3 swimming pools. They do a very nice job with water features throughout the lobby and hotel grounds. It is still in a soft opening stage, so staff were inconsistent in their knowledge. No one had a map of the hotel so you had to learn where everything was on your own. The restaurants near the freeform pool were the best, nice paninis and salads for lunch. This is a great location for meetings at the adjacent Palais des Congress, but it is away from the Medina (maybe a 15 minute walk)."
 July 2017,5,Exceptional service !,"I'm cheap when it comes to raiting a hotel Movenpick Marrakesh gets 5 stars ! We were thinking of staying one night, changed our minds and stayed for 4 more nights. Yes. We liked it that much. We stayed in the Mini Suits building. This wonderful resort has so much to offer in all categories. I loved the fact that we had a ""personal"" swimming pool near the suit. There's 3 more. I loved the Spa and its (free) Saunas and Huge clean Jacuzzi. I would like to point out the wonderful service we received in all hotel departments but you know sometimes a personal touch means the world to you. So Ms. Nezha in the reception that took the extra mile helping us in a personal matter and dear Mrs. Fatmah who took such a good care of us in her motherly manner during all our breakfasts. The…"
 July 2017,5,Excellent Hotel and staff,Reda was a helpful guy who showed me around marakech and the hotel and made me feel welcome! Will be returning very soon and telling more people of the beautiful place. The service in bar Le mansou by Reda was very good/ 5*
 July 2017,5,Excellent Hotel but better staff!,"The best staff for my wife and I was Ms. Nezha Afiry head supervisor of reception in the hotel, second was Ms. Samie Benkaddour Guest relations agent; along with Ms. Fatima Souhal in the breakfast and dining room area, she should be the Manager not a waitress with all due respect"
 July 2017,5,Highly Recommend Movenpick Hotel Marrakech,The hotel is gorgeous. The rooms are great. The concierges were very helpful. I loved the breakfasts. I am not that fond of the standard American breakfast. The hotel's breakfasts had delightful variety.
 July 2017,5,Loved loved loved,"Great new resort in Marrakech -- good location in Hivernage, super clean and comfortable and just absolutely beautiful grounds/facilities. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, wish I could've stayed longer!"
 July 2017,4,Very good Hotel,I bed room is very good and staff are excellent specially the service at breakfast. very good room house keeping the only comment is the weak wifi at room. the event businesses facility has problem in AC and small rooms doors sounds are very annoying. the round tables lunch box was not good
 July 2017,5,7 nights stay in Moevenpick Marrekech,Super good kids club. Very warm and friendly staff who really did great job. Children had a great time during I was working. Nice hotel with friendly staff. They tried their best to help. Delicious food.
 July 2017,4,Beautiful hotel but with crazy policy for bringing in food.,"We stayed at this hotel for a week while I attended a conference and my husband was a tourist. We stayed in a ""junior suite"" which was fantastic. It has a comfortable living room, and a well-separated bedroom, and a nice outdoor balcony. However, we encountered one situation that we have never encountered before in a hotel. One afternoon we invited friends over for a happy hour in our suite. We went to a grocery store in advance and bought snacks, like olives, cheese and crackers. The hotel has a security check when you enter, and they would not allow us to bring in the food! Other friends said they tried to bring in a box of cookies and were told they were not allowed. This seems like a really crazy policy for a hotel, especially one that has such nice suites and rooms!"
 May 2017,5,"Yes, superior hotel","Loved everything about this hotel, right location, spa, pool, food, lobby, mint tea, rooms were large and had a balcony. Don't miss staying here! There were able to get me a spa appt the same day as we arrived. So very accommodating."
 July 2017,5,A week in Marrakesh,"My wife and I vacationed in Marrakesh using this hotel as our base. Despite the 45+ oC temperatures the room was pleasant, the service was excellent and the included breakfast one of the best I have seen. I would definitely stay here again should I return."
 July 2017,4,Overall Very Good Stay,"The room and facilities were great. Very roomy. The air conditioner could be improved as it wasn't cool enough- however it was manageable. Need more information on the restaurants, map of the facilities, and amenities. The choices available for breakfast was excellent and the service was great. In addition, the café in the lobby was excellent for lunch or a quick snack."
 July 2017,3,"5 star hotel, 1 star staff","The hotel itself was beautiful, and very clean. Our room was a good size and very comfortable. I loved the pool area, it had really nice loungers and no trouble getting a bed no matter what time you arrive. It's in a good location, close to the airport and the medina, as well as some good restaurants. The breakfast was great - lots of options and nice outside area to eat. The other restaurants were very nice but no one eating there, so very quiet! The bar is lovely with a terrace looking over the pool, but again there was never anyone there. The negatives of this hotel fall down to the staff. I did not find them very helpful or accommodating. Trying to order a drink by the pool or in the bar was just hard work and they couldn't understand what we wanted even when pointing to…"
 July 2017,5,Great Guest Relation,"Awesome hotel and staff. Excellent Moroccan restaurant and staff. I would like to make a special mention of Amine- Guest Relations, who took great care of our needs and made our stay very comfortable. Definitely recommend for hotel comfort, decor and especially staff."
 April 2017,4,Morocco enough!,"It may not carry the charm of the smaller riads, but the hotel delivers Morocco as it should be. Every single detail of the hotel tells a story of Marrakech, you just need to pay close attention. The food at all restaurants was amazing. The best though was the massage at the spa!"
 July 2017,3,An average hotel,"The hotel has lovely modern and classy interior design. The rooms were the same as any other modern 5* star hotels. It did not have any touch of Moroccan art and culture. Breakfast buffet had nice options of hot and cold foods. Pool area always so crowded. Towels were provided in abundance. However, the staff members in the reception desk and the main entrance (guards) were not very hospitable. Their expression constantly looked serious and stressed. They did not look approachable at all. On the other hand, the other staff especially the one who did our hotel and room tour was very nice and friendly. He made us feel welcomed. We stayed in this hotel on the last part of our Marrakech trip as it is close to the airport. We will try another hotel in the same area on our next visit…"
 June 2017,5,Beautiful stay in Movenpick,Have a nice trip to MARRAKECH while staying in Movenpick. I can recommand easily this hotel for comfort and quality of the attention. You can also be in few minutes in the center for tourism and shopping Best regards
 July 2017,5,Perfect,"We stayed at Movenpick Mansour and had an excellent time! From the moment we arrived we received excellent service from Mohamed at the reception. Everything was perfect and we had a superb time. Everyday we spent time at the pool and received excellent service and attention from Imane Houd, she checked on us, brought us drinks and took excellent care of our every request. If you are looking for a beautiful hotel, centrally located, with all of the amenities you would want in a holiday look no further. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back."
 July 2017,5,Fantastic Experience,"What a great hotel! And excellent customer service. Great staff at every department- pool, spa, restaurant, bar, reception, concierge etc. Apart for the fact that this hotel is fairly new, the experience was absolutely worth it. I give this hotel 5 stars for everything ,including the value for money and the friendliness of the staff. Another brownie points for them is they don't typically allow outside food to be brought in. The staff was kind enough and said they would make the exception. Small things like that make a big difference to customers. Great hotel and I definitely recommend! Thank you!!"
 July 2017,5,Fantastic experience,"We have enjoyed Mövenpick Hotel for 5 days. Marvellous decoration, customer-oriented in all the staff, beautiful places to explore inside the hotel, very good meal in all the restaurants. The room was superb with no noise from outside. A strong recommendation to have a fantastic experience in Marrakech!!"
 June 2017,5,Nice hotel,"Nice modern hotel. Rooms are new and recently renovated The hotel has a nice big pool. our HK staff was amazing and big thanks to nouhad from reception Great location. I will come back despite some issue samia ""guest relation "" she tried to resolve on a good manner , this was due to luck cooperation by reservation manager."
 June 2017,4,Overall review,"Nice hotel, good services overall, front desk needs to much the standard of this hotel, nice and comfy rooms, enjoyed by the family, lovely breakfast, amenities suitable for families, would definitely be back again."
 June 2017,4,A little tired but still works well,"The rooms are a little tired. Some of the rooms have great views, some of the others look straight into an office building. The rooms are good size and everything works well. The lounge is good and the breakfast options are very good. The people are very friendly and helpful. Did struggle for anyone to pick up the room service phone. Reasonably central. Is a new Starbucks close by."
 June 2017,3,Beautiful hotel but average food,"this hotel is beautiful and when you enter you can smell the scent of citrus orange and that was the only thing I liked about the movenpick . the cons : No one spoke English and they were stand offish not really as friendly as they should be . Food was very average and expensive They never left us coffee for our room And I didn't like the location, I would stay in the Gueliz area if I were to come back there's more to do and nicer , cute, cheaper restaurants in that area ."
 May 2017,4,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a stunning hotel in both setting and facilities, multiple pools, spa, gym, on site restaurants etc. We had an issue with and overflowing shower which was partly fixed but on speaking to reception they immediately moved us to a different room which was bigger and better. The breakfast is excellent with great variety of continental and local Moroccan options including the delicious layered bread. The breakfast staff is wonderful too who are eager to help. The only complaint was the pools were not heated. The hotel has all the things you could possibly need including restaurants and bar on site. The area is upmarket and very safe."
 June 2017,5,Amazing luxury hotel,"I stayed at Movenpick Marrakech a long weekend and I felt like a princess! Everything was perfect! The bed very comfy, the room big and a spaceful bathroom. It's a real relaxing place! The spa is amazing!"
 May 2017,4,Nice option in Marrakech,"Nice option who travels to Marrakech. It is located in the new part of Marrakech, so the Hotel and the neighborhood are modern with restaurants and mall. Rooms are clean. Wifi Free. The service is excellent, from the Hotel recepction to the restaurant. The swimming pool and the SPA are excelent to rest and enjoy the day. It is near the downtown and the touristic attraction. You can exchange EUR or USD into Dirhams in the reception. But don't forget to spend all Dirhams before you leave Morroco. It is hard to exchange back."
 April 2017,4,Good hotel with slow service,"Visited this hotel for a few days stay. The hotel is in a good condition snd several choices of restaurants. We whent for the one with Marrakech cousine twice since they served very good food. Service at the restaurant was exellent. Poolarea was good not to crowded and breakfast was very good with a big selection of choices, the orange juice was really top notch. I am a frequent gym user and very picky about this altough this hotel had a gym well over my expectations, very good. The only really downside of the hotelexperience itself was checkin and checkout procedure took forever and this makes me put only 4 points in this hotel. I would recommend this hotel, please look over your routines for check in and out."
 May 2017,5,A pleasant experience,"A pleasant experience during staying at Movenpick,comfortable and quiet environment, excellent service and food, well-located and easy of access to airport, train station, shopping mall and scenic spot."
 May 2017,4,Marrakech,Lovely hotel let down by disorganised service during a business trip. Mini Bar not filled bar staff unaware of drinks orders and unable to cope with more than 20 people in the bar at any one time. Restaurant staff left others to pick up there work.
 May 2017,4,Comfort in Marrakesh,"Movenpick is a massive estate spread over a large area. Went there for a large international conference. My opinion is that this is not a suitable venue for a large conference. However, I am sure that Movenpick would serve well as a base on a leisure and holiday adventure. Food is good in all the restaurants - but still they all lack ambiance - just too sterile. People working there are very nice and friendly - but too much ""manjana"" - the efficiency and expediency of the service is absent for most of the part. People are running around in circles. The hotel is only about 15 minutes from the international airport and it is not far from the city centre where all the restaurants are. Taxis are readily available outside - but of course - one has to haggle over prices since there…"
 May 2017,4,Well kept and some rooms and suites are superb !,Diespite initial shortcomings and availability of hangars and iron (Conference so needed to iron shirts).. the staff eventually came through and made the stay comfortable. The facilities and location are very good. The concierge is also good and so are the hostesses ( excluding the over serious important looking and behaving manager of the Mediterranean restaurant ). The service at breakfast is excellent despite the large numbers of guests.. some tired people at the front desks. But a good job overall.
 May 2017,1,Rude staff and serivces are poor,"I stayed there due to a conference. when I arrived in the hotel, our meeting suites were not set up as what we required. the service to the meeting was also poor. we had times having 3 pots of hot water without coffee or milk, or with 2 pots of milk without coffee and 2 pots of coffee without milk. the check out and departure procedure were disturbing. I was given a departure ticket after checking out and I gave the ticket when I was about to leave the hotel. suddenly the hotel securities stopped my leaving and asked me to go back to the check out counter without explanation. the staff were extremely rude and treated me as a criminal when I refused to go back. Eventually it turns out no issue with my payment but it delayed my departure from the hotel. I missed my flight on that…"
 May 2017,4,Great Stay,"Stayed one week to attend a conference in the hotel (which is attached to a huge conference centre), accompanied by my wife. Selected a suite and had a wonderful stay. Room was spacious and comfortable and spotlessly clean. Service to the room was very good, though they seem to have a very limited number of irons and ironing boards if, like me, you need one to try and look smart. Good provision of restaurants and bars, though service is pretty slow. This was noticeable in the Medi Terra, but food is very good - it is partly in a courtyard which is a nice feature. The Moroccan restaurant was very good as was the poolside restaurant. Staff were very helpful and courteous. There are two large swimming pools and we found a smaller, private pool near the Spa which better suited us.…"
 May 2017,3,Decent but not great,"It's quite an impressive hotel, it's grand - two massive pools, a nice bar, lots of different bits and pieces to this hotel. But I felt it was missing the class that goes with a world class hotel. Maybe it was a bit of an off week for Movenpick Marrakech. Might go back if the price is right. Most people seemed to enjoy it."
 May 2017,3,business trip,"need improvements especially in time of service providing , takes too long food also need improvement especially at the Mediterranean restaurant internet is so week and many interruption some of the staff are excellent especially Mr Mustafa at breakfast restaurant"
 May 2017,5,Stunning hotel,"This is a visually stunning hotel, exceptionally comfortable and with with many plus points. The majority of the staff were very friendly and competent, though some of the staff serving drinks and food around the pools could do with some more basic training (we waited for about an hour for something we ordered on one day, and when we eventually inquired we were informed that the items were not available). The other pool staff (lifeguards etc.) were very attentive however. Breakfast were superb, with excellent fresh orange juice (and others) in great abundance. Touches like the ""chocolate hour"" (5-6 pm each day, with a variety of hand made chocolate delicacies on offer) and delicious hors d'ouevres at the bar from 7 pm were much appreciated."
 May 2017,4,"Movenpick Hotel, Marrakech","Excellent hotel, beautiful interior and pool. Staff very attentive to your needs, sometimes forgetful. Outstanding outdoor pool service. Service at the bar-restaurant is extremely slow, and they don't have all the drinks that feature on their menu, but food is all right."
 May 2017,5,Beautiful and relaxing,"Stayed there for a week in May. It was an absolutely beautiful hotel from the moment you stepped in. The staff were extremely friendly, even at the pool they would always ask if we were OK. The hotel itself is sophisticated with a modern take to Moroccan design. It had beautiful water features everywhere, so beautiful that you wanted to take a pic of each room. It was a very calm atmosphere, mostly couples or business people - but everyone minded their own business. There were no kids there at all when we went which made it more relaxing. The hotel itself is 5-10 minutes away from so many things including the airport. The only thing I will say however is that I probably wouldn't go back to the SPA, because even though it was beautiful, we chose a 30 minute treatment out of the…"
 December 2016,5,Newly renovated extensive paradise near the city,"We stayed at the hotel on our way South over the High Atlas in December, and on our way back in January. This is a beautifully renovated hotel with multiple buildings spread out over amazing grounds, with pools and greenery and a most extraordinary foyer. Great breakfast and very enthusiastic food & beverage director/deputy hotel manager. Well equipped and appointed rooms. The hotel's Director of Engineering and his team made a huge effort to arrange charging for our Tesla EV at the hotel, for free! The hotel plans to install more permanent electric vehicle (EV) charging arrangements in the underground car park, which would be a lot better. Easy to get a bit lost at first in the extensive grounds with multiple buildings, and internal layouts also take a bit of getting used…"
 May 2017,5,Site Inspection,I was very happy with everything! Marrakech is an impressiv city and the Movenpick hotel is a fantastic conference location. Also my client was more than impressed about accommodation and rooms in Palais des Congres.
 May 2017,3,Mixed bag,Nice room but the 2 bedside lights could only be turned off by unplugging them. The shower/tub was nice but the water goes all over the bathroom. Poorly engineered. Service at the pool and breakfast was great but in the evening restaurants was poor.
 May 2017,3,Not 5 star,"Half through a multi week stay and wishing I could move. It's too bad, really, it's a nice building to walk into but like many of those, the rooms and service don't match the look. After trying several of the restaurants found the food bland at best. The breakfast certainly isn't up to Movenpick standard. The promised 24 hour cafe seems to run out of food in the evening. All in, F&B not great. Service in general misses the mark in that promises just aren't met - I've given up asking to have my room made up early every morning, it happens when it happens. The infrastructure is worn, the tile floor of the elevator in my building is cracked and dips when you step on it, and why do I have it ask for a new key all the time because it stops working (which is really annoying because…"
 May 2017,4,Wonderful stay,Very good hotel in a good area in Marrakesh - wonderful staff and hospitality - the hotel is beautiful with decorations all over and water features that are very refreshing - very good smell of fresh flowers - the melas and breakfast buffet has a very wide selection of tasty food - enjoyed the traditional mint tea in silver kettle and glass as well as the Tajine meats and cousscous
 May 2017,5,Awesome,"We stayed at the Mövenpick for a week and it was a pleasant experience. The hotel is very well located in between the airport and the city center. The area (Héritage) is very clean and organised. Positives + we arrived very early and the reception desk showed us the bar, took care of our luggage and made our waiting time as comfortable as possible + the room is very clean, well furnished, has a huge restroom and a very comfortable bed + the breakfast buffet offers a wide range of dishes + we really enjoyed the restaurants, the meals taste great. Especially the Medi Terra, excellent cuisine! + the bar/restaurant by the pool (Jamra) was very nice! Tasty snacks, homemade ice teas (i highly recommend the rosemarin one), drinks and attentive personell + the pool boys were very…"
 May 2017,3,Service needs work,"Huge hotel, good decor, great pool + excellent breakfasts + lunches. BUT - after loooong queue to check in, I was allocated a poolside room that hadn't been serviced, then relocated with minimal apology to an inferior room at the rear of the hotel, which suffered loud singing late into the (mid-week) night from a nearby bar. There was no iron + only 1 small bottle of water. Check out process equally painful - system was down + car that wasn't booked added to the bill. Staff were friendly + reasonably helpful but these issues mean I can't recommend for business travelers + I imagine there are better options in the price range for tourists too. Quick tip for those having trouble with de-magnetising room keys (as so many did) - keep it well away from your mobile phone!"
 May 2017,5,Fast and fast,"Restaurant Medi Terra Mediterranean cuisine good and place wonderful. Outside is perfect, inside is cool. Three or four courses at your taste. Good options and nice deserts. Atmosphere and staff combined. Cheers."
 May 2017,5,Spa de rose,Had one massage when I arrived with Najia. She said will have best massage of my life and I did not believe but yes was Thanks. Love it sure to recommend if you come to this hotel. Thanks for all hope I can repeat
 May 2017,3,Clean and modern hotel but to many rules,"I thought the hotel was modern and clean but the service needs improvements, especially at the front desk. On check in they made me wait an extremely long time for assistance. I booked four rooms and came with six people three girls and three guys. The staff made me feel like a criminal because the girls are Moroccan. On the Saturday I went to the supermarket and got some water and nuts to have in my room, I was told this is prohibited but after a tip they allowed me though. In future I will rent an apartment as I do not want the hassle from hotel staff."
 May 2017,5,Simply wonderful,"This hotel was recently totally renovated, it's brand spanking new, it's gorgeous, the staff were attentive and helpful, the room is fantastic, breakfast was great! I had not one complaint. The location is close to the medina, a quick walk to the Menara Mall, and very quiet."
 May 2017,1,Don't go !,"Pros, nice small room, cleaned every day , pleasant communal areas , great service by the pool area, good choice for breakfast Cons; surly , unhelpful reception. No map available for the duration of the stay, if you wanted any help they couldn't help, ! No recommendation of restaurant, places to go, reception staff need lessons in customer service , this ruined our experience so would recommend you go elsewhere if you want a pleasant, friendly stay!"
 April 2017,5,Amazing,Really good hotel in a very good location Hotel is near main menara mall Also close to airport.staff was lovely pool area is beautifully designed and been kept very clean breakfast buffet has got huge selection and variety of different dishes overall we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel
 April 2017,4,Suite,The hotel also the suite i took were very good like rje service end cleanliness. The price i paid for the suite was top expencive. The breakfast was good bot excellent. Also the swimming pool was more than good.
 April 2017,5,GREAT HOTEL,"Just Keep Doing What You Are Doing. Put A Microwave In The Room. I Do Have One Compliant. I Came To The Convention By Myself And Did Not Choose To Eat Alone In Your Restaurants FOR EACH MEAL And Pay The Expensive Price For Doing That. I Chose One Night To Go Out And JUST Get A Pizza. I Was Stopped At The Entrance Saying I Could Not Bring Food Into The Hotel. Now I Can See That I Cannot Bring Food Into Your Hotel And Take It To Your In House Restaurants, Sit Down There And Eat It. The Room I Rented There Was My Home Away From Home. You Were Telling Me I Could Not Take Food To My Home Unless I Bought It From Your Restaurant. Your Concierge Wanted To Argue The Point That No Hotel Allows That. Prior To Staying At Your Hotel, I Stayed At The Atlantis Hotel On The Palm Island In…"
 May 2017,1,Not a 5* hotel - terrible service - I do not recommend this hotel,"This hotel doesn't worth any visit! The reasons why are listed below: - poor service - reception staff as no sense of customer services and are impolite with customers - the lovely terrace for breakfast CANNOT be used because it is surrounded by enormous bees (everyone had a look for a table inside!) - SHAME - food and drinks are ridiculously overpriced - food portion and choices as below average - air con doesn't work well in the room and make a strong noise (not possible to leave it on at night) - the pool water is super cold although it says in the hotel description : ""heated pool""! All of this has been related to the hotel reception but no one gives a S***! I came few times in Marrakesh, and there are so many nice places to go, but definitely not this one!!! Don't…"
 April 2017,4,Beautiful hotel close to the Medina,A luxury hotel located close to the Medina with friendly staff and beautifully appointed rooms and grounds. Although large it never feels overcrowded and the choice of 2 pools was lovely for afternoon sunbathing and swimming. The hotel has been recently refurbished to a very high level and the quality of food in the restaurants was good. Perfect for a longer trip or in our case with golf clubs - trekking through the Medina with gold=f clubs would have been a nightmare!
 April 2017,4,Pleasant short week end stay,"A very pleasant and comfortable experience. For a very big hotel recently re-opened, I found the staff very competent and most important, keeping the smile even under the pressure of the full house week-end of May 1st The hotel its grand in the middle of vast well groomed gardens, and a magnificent swimming pool .The buildings are spread so that its not overwhelming. we were given a first room (4426) that had a unpleasant view of AC pipes. Despite the limited choice, due to the hotel being full, the very helpful young ladies at the main reception, Nouhad and Nezha, did their outmost to accommodate us in a better room with a view. The breakfast is at the level of this 5stars hotel , luscious and abundant. from our arrival at the parking lot to our departure we've seen keen…"
 April 2017,3,Reception and service people,"You have to make sure at an early time point of the day that you get all the beds that you expect in the room. The first night we could not have the extra bed although we had orderede the room for three adults. Besides that, the rest of the hotel is very nice, clean and beatiful. The restaurants all serve delicious food in nice surroundings."
 April 2017,3,"Almost, a few niggles need sorting","Movenpick is a lovely new hotel, the decor and rooms are great. A few niggles, my room key stopped working on 5 separate occasions, a long walk back in reception for a 5 star hotel is not ideal with a little one. Breakfast good, staff pleasant but overall need training, always trying to pass the buck. Maybe we will stay again if things improve !"
 April 2017,1,Don't pick this hotel,I did not lake the service of this hotel the staff was very cold they make us wait 3 h before to give us the room I will never go back to this hotel is expensive for noting my experience was orible don't go to this hotel is you want to go to marakech they is so much better
 April 2017,5,Very unique and sophisticated hotel.,"Best 5☆ hotel in marrakech !! My check in and check out was quick, I've had a suite with twin bed me and my sister, food was fresh, customer service was great, staff very friendly and helpful, very professional, I have absolutely nothing to complain about, I will definitely go back in summer."
 April 2017,4,Very nice location,Very good quality overall with a nice location where you feel relax and confortable. The atmosphere is quite and the and the set up is very nice. I will recommend it for events or for relaxing in family or with friends.
 April 2017,2,BAD SERVICE,"Great hotel, great location, but really poor quality service. We felt no welcome at all, we had several issues with the staff since day 1. Rooms are great but a little noisy and not cleaned everyday i had to literally call when i came in (nighttime) to get it cleaned because it was still messy from 7 am when i left ... Waiters won't come propose to you drinks when you sit by the pool. Kids club smells bad, it is dark, i couldn't let my little sister stay there for a second. Due to her strict diet, i had to go shopping by the local supermarket to get her food to eat during the day but it was refused by security saying that the hotel doesn't accept food.. The manager was mean and unprofessional. Unpleasant experience, i don't recomand it. I hope the direction will deal with…"
 April 2017,1,"Beautiful hotel, TERRIBLE service!","I have stayed at other Movenpicks in the past and so I knew the quality of service which you would expect from this chain of hotels. Well my expectations could not have been more wrong. Don't get me wrong, the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very comfortable and clean, however, the service is diabolical. Our trouble started on arrival when we were told our room would be available at 3pm and it was not ready until 5pm. When we finally got to our room and started to unpack so that we could get showered and changed for dinner, we received a call that we were in the wrong room and would have to move. We were informed that someone would be with us immediately to show us to the correct room but they did not arrive for 40 minutes! In that time we called reception and nobody…"
 April 2017,4,Beautiful Hotel!,"Stayed at this hotel with my husband and two boys. The hotel is absolutely beautiful with amazing decor. The pool area is nice and relaxing and very clean. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. They do have a few service issues with regards to the housekeeping staff - many of whom do not speak english, however the Duty Manager - Amin, Karim in the restaurant and the General Manager went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. The staff were brilliant with our little boy he loved it here. The kids club needs a little work - maybe more organised activities during the holiday periods and an outdoor childrens play area. Would not hesitate staying here again. Thank you for a very relaxing 7 days!"
 April 2017,1,Very bad service. Chekking in or chekking out just for that reserve an extra day!! Lack of respect and uninterestesd per,Bad! Bad! Bad! Never again. I prefer to stay at ibis hotel !!!!!! Much cheaper and much better!!!! Personel badly educated. Not aware of 5stars at all. No mini bar. Ok an empty one and if you complain about it they tell you it s not necessary just call room service it s much cheaper. If you call for a service just wait and forget because they wont come. There s even no bottle of water in the room so if you re with a baby or child ............... so don t go there
 April 2017,5,The place to be in Marrakech,"Beautiful hotel and location, warm Morocan welcome and great service. I was there for business and took few days off to enjoy the city or Marrakech The architecture of the hotel is a nice mixture between Marrakech style, oriental and modern trends...the breakfast service is top notch and the bar Manso is very cozy offering a soft atmosphere. The bed is very confortable and the bathroom amenities are of good quality. I recommend this hotel to travellers coming for leisure or business puposes"
 April 2017,3,"Beautiful, but could be better","This hotel is advertised as a 5 star hotel, but it misses the 5 star hospitality. The positive: the decor is beautiful, the rose smell when you walk in is lovely, the pool is beautiful (no jacuzzi), breakfast is good, the rooms are a nice size. The negative: check in/check out is very slow, room service and restaurant food takes a very long time, my shower flooded and no one rectified after a complaint, my room keys stopped working out of no where, when I went to put my meal on my room it said I didn't exist as a guest and that my room was under someone else's name now, which was strange because I wasn't checking out for two more days. The hotel is beautiful, but these hospitality issues definitely are something to take note of."
 April 2017,3,Nice Suite but that's all,"We've booked a nice, modern and quiet Suite which wasn't very expensive. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing in this hotel. Reception staff is unfriendly and we didn't feel welcomed at all ; the lady at the reception even rolled her eyes to heaven because she didn't understand the name of the booking. The service at the pool is very slow and poor ; it takes more than 20 min for your fruit juice to arrive and sometimes you don't even get what you've ordered. However, the worst is the Spa. I had a ''semi permanent gel manicure'' and it took them 3h30 and 4 unsuccessful attempts to paint my nails. The treatment was very painful since they used wooden sticks without any gentleness and even made one of my nail bleed while pushing the stick under it. To sum up, if you plan to…"
 March 2017,5,super hotel,Very nice stay with comfortable atmosphere. After a city tour you can relax by the pool or the SPA. To recommend is a drink at the bar with pleasant live music. Nice to have breakfast outside. Thank you for the lovely stay. We like to come back.
 March 2017,4,"""Great hotel, service not up to par ...""","We arrived at the hotel there was no welcoming no bellman to carry our laggage , just some security guard standing at the front door , almost 30 min for the check in , still no bellman, until the receptionist had asked a janitor to carry our luggage who by the way was very kind , polite friendly and so happy to help., speaking very good english , his name is zakaria , that We highly recommend him as a billman .Beside , the hotel was spotlessly clean with its entrance and the lobby , the pool area is nice and clean , excellent food at the restaurants , rooms are clean and comfortable, I definitely plan to stay here again."
 March 2017,4,March in Marrakech,Beautiful lobby and public areas including large pool area. Room and bathroom spacious and modern. Excellent number of options at breakfast. Loved the chocolate hour. Only negative was the service levels by some hotel staff.
 March 2017,5,Excellent Stay,"had a very pleasant stay at the hotel , staff were very helpful , breakfast was very good , would recommend this hotel , has a lovely swimming pool , rooms were very clean and a lovely size bathroom ,"
 March 2017,4,Great hotel if you don't mind a couple of service issues,"The hotel is fab. If the service is polished especially in regard to housekeeping it'll be perfect. I was on business and asked housekeeping for an ironing board twice, it never came. Not a huge issue but not great either. othewise a lovey hotel."
 February 2017,5,Great customer service,"I was nicely welcomed and served, I still remember being welcomed by a receptionist called Dounia with an exquisite smile and a charming persona that pushes you to wanting to get back to visit Movenpick again."
 March 2017,5,Lovely attractive hotel,"Large attractive hotel in the new area of Marrakesh. Only several minutes from the airport and souks. Good size rooms, very clean with an excellent pool area. One of the pools is heated which was a Hugh bonus during March. Staff were very attentive and polite. Food and drinks were alittle expensive."
 November 2016,4,great breakfast and poolside area,"Located outside Marrakesh city wall, this hotel is in the recent neighborhoods close to other newer hotels. Room are clean but not luxurious. The pool side is good and ideal to stay in the autumn and winter when weather is great (not too hot) to enjoy the pool. The breakfast presents a great variety of locals products as well as the typical international options."
 March 2017,4,Take a suite,"We had a beautiful corner suite, but our friend had a normal dobbelt room, that was dark and small. We felt that we had a lot for our money, but she didn't. The breakfast vas all right, but nothing to talk about. If you vas hungry between 16 and 19:30 you have to go to another hotel or restaurants."
 March 2017,4,"Nice Stay and wonderful package of Location, Service and Hospitality","Good experience for a short stay in this hotel, I will return for sure next time but for a long journey to enjoy what is offered in this Hotel. I recommend this hotel for both kind of stay Business and Leisure."
 March 2017,3,"Luxury prices, not very luxury service",Wifi was awful never experienced wifi so bad for a 5 star hotel. Service was very average staff weren't very friendly nor did they go out their way to make you feek special. Our door card stopped working numerous times which was very annoying. However location was good and hotel grounds was beautiful. Very overpriced for what it is. We paid £5 for a sprite in a glass bottle worth 30p ridicoulous!! Would not stay here again.
 March 2017,5,Very pleasant experience,"We had an overall very pleasant experience. The hotel was lovely and we were really impressed with our room. The hotel itself and poolside areas were very clean and well maintained. We were most taken back by the service we received, we were made to feel really welcome. The staff really went over and beyond what was expected to make our stay as pleasant as possible."
 March 2017,5,john and annmarie cork,An excellent 5 star hotel with excellent facilities to suit everyone..the staff were always heplful and cheerful and went out of their way to make this an excellent stay. The only small complaint I have is that they seem to cater more for the travelling business clientele than the average tourist as there was very little information or recommendations from the reception on what to do in Marrakech...but this did not affect our opinion that this is a wonder ful hotel and we had a wonderful stay.
 March 2017,5,"Amazing entrance, beautiful grounds, modern rooms, mixed service","This recently renovated hotel has a beautiful entrance and lobby area, with lush, well maintained grounds. The rooms are of a reasonable size and are well maintained with regularly replenished amenities. The hotel breakfast was satisfactory, with freshly made eggs/omelettes available, however it would have been nice to see a greater variety of fruit on offer. The hotel is well located, 7-10 minutes walk from Menara Mall (and its restaurants) and a 5 minute taxi to the main square in Marrakech. The hotel has a significant security presence, with 10+ security staff visible at any one time. This can be rather confusing, especially when you enter the hotel for the first time, carrying your luggage yourself after a long flight whilst those who appear like staff members (although…"
 March 2017,5,Definitely recommend!,"Very nice stay, super friendly and welcoming staff. The suite was amazing! We enjoyed the comfort and we valued the extreme kindness of the employees, specially the restaurant staff. I would definetly recommend it!"
 March 2017,5,Lovely stay in beautiful surroundings,"We enjoyed a gorgeous stay in beautiful surroundings. The staff were fabulous and the breakfast legendary. The pool guy and the maitre de at breakfast deserve special commendation they made my mum, my aunt and myself feel like Queens for a weekend. Thanks so much movenpick"
 March 2017,4,Lovely hotel in a good location,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, it's set in lovely well kept grounds. The good points are: Good location Nice room Good breakfast Friendly staff Lovely pool area Negative points: Ridiculously over priced spa Overpriced food and drink Bad food & beverage service at the pool The room is kept clean but sometimes things were not replenished i.e. flannels, water, tissues, bathrobes Having said all this I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to friends."
 March 2017,4,Good hotel!! :-),"I had a great stay at this hotel we practically had the entire hotel to ourselves! It was peaceful, quiet, a nice location close to the city centre but far enough away to feel out of the madness, and the spa with the complimentary jacuzzi and steam rooms open until 9pm every night was beautiful and right next to our part of the hotel! The grounds are beautiful the pool is really clean and the staff are happy to do anything for you, you just need to ask as they won't approach you asking for drinks at the pool but if you ask them for a snack or a drink whilst you're sunbathing they will go out their way to accommodate you. I felt the prices of the food were a little steep but noticed that in general everywhere half decent in morocco shared the hefty price tag. I feel if the hotel…"
 February 2017,2,"Room was too noisy, sound of moving furniture from about 5 am to 2 am","I could have handled any other issues but this one. I could barely get 2-3 hours of sleep due to this issue. I spoke to the front desk and nothing was done. Service was OK, sometimes you had to ask for things twice. Hotel is located close to the Menara airport, so in about 10-15 mins you reach the hotel from the airport. There is the Menara mall nearby, and some shops restaurants. As I was on a business trip, I did not have the chance to look around much unfortunately so I cannot tell how good/bad the location was."
 February 2017,3,Great hotel - Bizarre Errors,"Overall, our check-in process took half an hour. Four staff dealing with one customer, then, twenty minutes to check us in, despite everything being pre-paid. Our key car failed 9 times in a four days stay, and as our room was at the far side of the hotel - the walk back to reception was not welcome. There were six restaurants, but no price information available to guests. The best example of the weird service standards is probably this - Our bathroom got flooded from a blocked drain, so we put towels down n the floor to soak it up.Maintenance came and fixed the drain but left the soaked towels on the floor!"
 February 2017,5,Excellent hotel . Extraordinary much personal attention,Beautifull Hotel as good for townvisit as relaxing in luxury Personal showing of all the parts of the Hotel by Guest Relation manager Othmane . . Personal service during whole visit by every asked personal . Excellent food . Three restaurants . Swimming Pool heated outside . . Stay here from begiining till end a happening !
 February 2017,5,Great evening at méditerranéen movenpick,"I visited méditerranéen restaurant food was Nice and the service was super special mention is Khadija, who provided us with the most super service. We were a team of 06 persons, totally satisfied this saint valentin's day evening. Jude Ambe and Romeo Tessa."
 February 2017,4,"Great hotel with good services, close to everything :)","With an astonishing entrance you are captured of the magic of this hotel upon arrival. The staff of reception made a quick check in and then the tour to the room guided by the bellboy gave only better tate of our stay. The room was big and comfortable and with everything you should expect from a hotel of this category. Nice and very friendly staff all over, they really took care of us during our busy stay. Definitely recommendable."
 January 2017,4,Business Conference,"Visited here for three days at the end of Jan with 120 colleagues from around the globe. The hotel was a fantastic base to work from, being linked directly to the conference centre next door. Being refurbished in 2015 the general decor and rooms where excellent. The food for breakfast, lunch and dinner was also very good with the staff being most helpful. Maintenance issues were not dealt with quite as quickly but overall a excellent place to stay. The hotel was also close to the Medinah square and other Marrakesh attractions. Would recommend depending on the rates paid."
 January 2017,4,Not value for money,"The check in process in the hotel is extremely slow . You need to fill a paper form yourself . it looks like a 5 star hotel from outside but once you got in you can feel it is lack of maintenance . The lift in our building 3 has at least four faulty buttons . The breakfast is good ,and staff are overall very nice and friendly. But I have to say no one is actually trying to help out . They just stand there and we have to call for help . ( on one helped out with luggage/ and they refused to tell us where to find a taxi ?! But why ? ) it is not value for money"
 January 2017,2,Will never come again,"The service at the hotel was extremely poor! The bath in our room leaked water and the entire floor became wet.. it took the hotel 1 hour to solve it The only good experience we had was with the concierge, Abdulhaq was amazing and planned great trips for us."
 December 2016,4,A nice stay in Marrakech,"A very good and excellent renovated hotel, but the service staff in the restaurant is not as goog trained as it should be in a five-star-category-hotel. Spa is very expencive and not worth. Not all of the restaurants were opened."
 January 2017,4,Relaxing,"We appreciated the relaxing and calm atmosphere of the Movenpick despite it is not far from the inner city. When the hotel is full, the breakfast room is very crowded and the service a bit chaotic. All in all a nice, recently renovated hotel."
 January 2017,5,"Top End Hotel, Stunning Accommodation","Read the reviews, deliberated over this and many other similar nearby hotels and trusted the trip advisor community, so thank you great choice this place is for film stars and A listers, luxurious rooms our Queen was a bit small and lacking storage space so perhaps upgrade! breakfast buffet is magnificent loads to choose from. Full Scottish minus the black pudding n beans. Continental, Moroccan fish options great thick black coffee. The pool area and spa are spotless we even have a group playing live music today by the pool bar. Move tomorrow to another hotel it has a certainly its work cut out keeping up with this one. Great way to spend your New Year. it is very French influenced but most staff understand English very well."
 December 2016,5,New Year's holiday in Marrakech,This hotel is a 5 star hotel but with a quite low rating in Hotels.com. After booking I read quite a few of the comments from precious guests and was a bit worried before arrival. However there was no reason for worries. From the minute we came to the hotel we only met extremely nice and helpful staff and the hotel itself is definitely wonderful. The interior design throughout the whole hotel is very tasteful. There is a large swimmingpool and several smaller pools placed around the large complex all cosy and we'll kept. The large garden is beautiful and constant being nicely kept by a large garden crew. We stayed in a superior room on 5th floor with a view of the rooftops of Marrakech on our extensive side and the Atlas mountains in the horizon of the other side - beautiful -…
 December 2016,5,"Recently opened, the hotel has almost all ingredients","Recently opened, the hotel has almost all ingredients for its 5* standard. Very friendly and competent staff, the heated outdoor swimming pool is a must, everything much better than at the Radisson. The fluidity of the service needs to still improve but I'm sure it will very quickly."
 December 2016,5,The Best Hotel in Marrakesh By Far,"Having visited Marrakesh Several Times , staying in Various Hotels, This Hotel is by far the best I have stayed in. The Photo's on the Website simply do not do the Hotel Justice, it is a stunningly beautiful Hotel, There are 2 different reception areas, both Beautiful, The staff were all very Polite and Professional, Nothing was too much for any of them. The location is perfect for Marrakesh, walking distance from the Menara Mall , and just a short Taxi Ride from Medina, and other tourist spots. We chose the 1 bedroom suite and were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite which was the most luxurious and spacious suite My Son's and I have ever stayed in, They didn't want to leave the Hotel ! The Pool area and all grounds are beautifully designed, a very well equipped Gym, which my Son…"
 November 2016,4,Movenpick Hotel Marrakech,"Hotel had excellent gym and swimming pool facilities. Good restaurant for breakfast, though I wished they vary the menu - practically same range for two weeks - scrambled eggs, Moroccan soup, Moroccan harira (ala Singapore Kacang Pool -the Singapore version had mashed kidney beans unlike the Moroccan's which had whole kidney beans), boiled eggs, sausage, pancakes, prata, selection of bread and cheese, fruits dates. The range of flavored butter was amazing, though. There was apricot butter, dates butter, fig butter - deliciously sweet and creamy - lovely on your bread. Moroccan tea was also served but you had to order from the waiter. The only snag is that me and some other fellow hotel patrons had problems with our room key cards - my card had to be validated every time before…"
 November 2016,4,Nice stay,"The hotel has been renovated rooms are luxiourious and food is excellent. Nevertheless some rooms had poor internet access. Building are quite far from the reception so when you have a problem with your magnetic card, which happened to me at least 5 times you have to walk a long distance back to the reception, which is not very convenient. No phones at the floors to enable you to contact the reception when you have a problem with your key and it's very hard to bump into one of the hotel employees."
 December 2016,5,Great Experience,This is lovely and calm hotel to stay and experience the top managing of the such luxury hotel. Location staff and service in high managing. I would like to recommended all to go and experience the relaxation.
 December 2016,5,Fantastic restaurant,Was lucky enough to be bought a birthday dinner by my friend in the restaurant here and it was absolutely fabulous. A delicious mushroom soup with foie gras and perfectly poached egg; excellent fish (John Dory) and a wonderful chocolate mousse cake. I drank Casablanca beer (which I thoroughly enjoy). Lovely room; great service. The hotel is most impressive looking.
 December 2016,5,Excellent choice!,"I am impressed by the hotel. Everything was excellent - quality of staff, comfortable room, beautiful surroundings, tasty food. This is a place where you can rest as well with clean swimming pools. I would really stay there next time!"
 December 2016,5,Good quality of service,"Just returned from THIS HOTEL and loved it. , first time on this HOTEL and it was really wonderful. Food was outstanding, best we've had , and drinks were mainly branded and flowed very freely for all inclusive. What really makes this place is the staff, spacialy the housekeeping staff their services were good during the day  but it was better at night  , The room attendant  at night was so professional and so polite and well mannered that we took a selfie with him ;) , i liked the fact that he could speak a very good english  , the room was very clean and tidy indeed. The bar staff were fab, cocktails were super and the waiters were good fun. the gym was clean with the best equipment , only one problem there was no showers and only one rest room . the public areas   were very…"
 November 2016,2,"Rude, grumpy, slow, unresponsive and inattentive staff.","I was here for a UN meeting as a country diplomatic delegate and I was greeted with by far the worst service attitudes I have ever seen in my life. Toiletries and tea/coffee are never replaced in room. Had to call and beg for these things every night. Room service leaves door open after service. Some of our staff had people entering their rooms unannounced. My room was near a stairwell which had slamming wooden doors. But I think more than 20 rooms could hear the slamming. Breakfast was in a mess- coffee never comes, never a clean table in sight. Rude staff scolds you for moving tables or asking for new cultery. Also unhygienic practice of giving you used cups when they are lazy to get a new one. Conceirge confiscates unsanitary items before entry to hotel. Be prepared for…"
 November 2016,3,"Beauiful outdoors and amazing pool ,but average rooms","Nice hotel with beautiful outdoors and internal decorations but room on the ground floor would get flooded. Breakfast was quite good, but room service was too expensive. Pool was great and location perfect for my business travel attending the Climate Change Conference."
 November 2016,4,Review of Movenpick Hotel,"Movenpick is a truly beautiful and extravagant hotel. I was generally happy with its service and facility. One suggestion is for the hotel to change its breakfast buffet menu once in a while. While the food served in the morning is good and tasty, eating the same food for two weeks had its toll on us. And it would be good if the room service staff spoke English as well."
 November 2016,4,Brilliant until the check-out,"Wonderful hotel with excellent service most of the time - it fell down at check-out and I nearly missed my flight. The breakfast was superb, with so much choice and lovely staff - especially the lady who worked at the omelette station ( the one on the left!). The rooms were nice and large and kept scrupulously c lean."
 November 2016,3,Mixed feelings,"The hotel is beautiful, and I mean both the public areas and the rooms. The lobby is quite compelling and there are many spots where one can simply lounge and take in the view. My room was huge and had a balcony, large bedroom and spacious bathroom. However, there is an issue in the design of the shower cubicle, as using the angled shower caused a little flood in the bathroom (other colleagues reported the same adventure). Housekeeping services need to be improved. When I asked if I could borrow an iron to press my business clothes, I was told that they do not lend irons out and that I could send my clothes for laundry service if I wanted. One evening, someone from housekeeping tried to enter my room at 10:00 p.m. to turn my bed down. I received a jolt as someone tried to…"
 November 2016,5,Nice hotel with superb swimming pool and friendly service,"I was there for the COP 22 in November and I enjoyed my stay at Moevenpick! The only issue was the mini bar in the room much too expensive and I was invoiced wrongly although I had never taken anything from the bar! The facilities, the gym, swimming pool, breakfast were excellent!"
 November 2016,4,Very nice hotel,Recommended to stay at this wonderful hotel. Breakfast is very good with various foods. The room and the swimming area are very clean. Hotel staff is friendly and always there to help. But the room-service and restaurant is very expensive.
 November 2016,4,A pleasant stay,Friendly staff. Nice poolside Good breakfast Nice layout of hotel compound Birthday cake for customer on birthday Card key tended to malfunction easily Cleaners might forget to give you towels or tea bags
 November 2016,4,Review Movenpick Hotel Marrakech,Somehow I felt that individual room thermostat did not function very well. This is vital item for guest stay. Sometimes it is felt attendance on request is slow. Had to remind the Reception a few times before it is done within an hour!
 November 2016,4,"Lovely decor, expansive grounds",I was very satisfied with my stay at Movenpick in Marrakech. The setting is very luxurious and it caters to the comfort of of the guests. My room was well appointed with all the usual amenities. Excellent buffet breakfast.
 November 2016,4,Luxurious place. A few details to be worked on,"The hotel is nicely designed. It offers luxurious spaces, a large swimming pool, a gym, etc. Breakfast food is quite good. It lies some 15 min walking from a large shopping mall, supermarket and restaurants. This is clearly a five star hotel, although a few details (faulty room keys, overwhelmed service staff during breakfast, no ample supply of drinking water, deficient room heating) lead me to discount a star."
 November 2016,4,fantastic facilities. Staff a way to go!,Great brand new hotel. The staff seems to be still getting to know how things work. No concierge and staff with no idea/no interest of providing guidance for dinning options and the alike (and the one restaurant they recommended had awful reviews in Tripadvisor....). No information int he room about hotel facilities and it is a huge hotel so you feel lost until you discover things by yourself. Food was fantastic!.
 November 2016,5,Beautiful decor,Recommended by gallerie of yahya to visit. King assembled the best artisans and artists for this hotel. Refined and exquisite - more understated than typical Moroccan. Once inside it feels like a completely different world.
 October 2016,5,éjour du octobre 2016 - voyage en solo,"good hotel i have been there for 6 days and was really pleased by the staff welcoming, i wiil mention zakaria the room attendant who served me twise he was very friendly and amuzing he speak very good english and french too . the food also was very good ; and i liked the pool and the gym . i wish the best for this hotel ; it is already at there ."
 October 2016,5,"excellent staff, amazing breakfast and comfortable rooms","the hotel is totally renovated, with friendly, smiley and devoted staff - particular thanks to concierge Bahia - with brand new facilities and super comfortable rooms. the food in the hotel restaurante is extremely good and diverse, for all types of taste and diets."
 October 2016,5,Movenpick,"Excellent hotel , good service and food, very comfortable rooms. Definitely a great place to stay in Marrakech . The staff were very helpful too. Beautiful swomming pool and located near town center. Thanks"
