 July 2022,1,Bad experience,"Very bad experience with this hotel, the room that we took was just horrible. It's very noisy and very hot at night ( no air conditioning) The staff is not friendly at all. The price was really very high regarding the quality of the service ( 63 $ , 630 MAD). The real room is not the same as you see in the photos.",Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2020,5,Helpful,After paying an extra 75 MAD for a room upgrade all went well for the few nights we stayed. Desk clerks in Maroc are always on the lookout to fleece a bit extra as here and there but the Manager in this place was honest and truly helpful doing his best to serve. Truly a breath of fresh air in a country that you need to be constantly vigilant.,Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2020,3,Some issues,"The hotel is ok , the issues that I faced in there the 1st night the room was not good , the phone was down, you need to walk down to the reception if you have a request , very bad view , when I asked the FD agent in the PM shift about that, he apologized about the phone , and informed me that he has rooms with a view but it cost me extra money just for the view which is not nice service, however in the night shift Abdulmajid was very nice and helpful , so thank you Abdulmajid for your help and good service, he offered me room move for free with a very nice view without hesitation and with awesome smile",Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2019,3,Poor Customer Service,"Although the hotel was clean and the rooms were decent, the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful. The hotel advertises its printing service (one of, if not the main reason why we chose this hotel), but alas the printer did not work. After appearing incredibly irritated upon being asked to help figure out what was wrong with it, he tried to help us fix it for all of 3 minutes before returning to his desk. He then refused to properly help us find somewhere else to print the boarding passes that we needed to board our flight in a couple hours. We eventually had to go to a different hotel where they were friendly enough to help and didn’t even ask for payment. All of this to say that although the hotel is decent, do not expect any type of customer service at all.",Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2019,5,No better place to stay!,"I could not have been happier with my stay at Hotel El Djenina. Not only are the rooms really clean and the staff very friendly, but the location is one of a kind. It is a five-minute walk away from the old town, just within reach of the Kasbah, and ideally close to the Marina. If you ever visit Tangier, I strongly suggest you stay here.",Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,5,About this hotel,I had a business trip and this hotel is amazing i recommend it to everyone who will have a business trip in tanger Also the room is so clean Manager is great responsability Also will get back again A+,Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2019,3,"Average, good location","The hotel is located near marina Beach and sea coast, the location is nice with all facilities nearby batoota shopping mall restaurants car rentals spa and other gift shops. The rooms are quite clean, but the hotel is old and needs some renovation. If you want to enjoy the city and have a place to sleep and keep your baggage it's the place for you. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Small elevator, small lobby. Price is a bit high for the rooms but for the location it worth it. Anyways I enjed the city more than the hotel as I spend most of my time outside.",Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2019,2,Place is falling apart,"Don't be deceived by nice entrance and seating at reception. The check in was simple and pleasant, paid cash but no offer of a receipt. Opened up to room 209 saw one towel and bedside lamps missing - instead wires dangling out.Decided we deserved a better room for $85AUD. As we closed the door, it handle fell off! Receptionist fine with changing room, 210...hmm, bedsidelamps but no bulbs! Shower was a bit dirty, their is no where to put soap or shampoo other than the floor plus the water leaks below the door so floor is wet beside the loo. Could not be bothered changing rooms again. There for one night. Quite a noisy street. Same side as hotel,going upthe street past a couple of stores is a cafe with nice staff and serving a hearty breakfast. Location pretty good.Recommend you…",Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2019,2,Not Impressed,"The pictures are very misleading, I was not impressed by this hotel at all. Wasnt very clean, had a musty smell and the bathroom was not great. Would never go again, hotel needs a massive renovation to sort out the current issues and make it cleaner. Wifi was extremely slow too.",Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2019,5,Great Hotel,"My wife and I traveled to Tangier, Morocco in mid-January of 2019. We stayed at the Hotel El Djenina. It’s a family owned hotel near the marina. The hotel is extremely clean and well maintained. The staff are professional and very friendly. You will find the owner around at all times. He is a very friendly and honest man who truly cares about his guests. He and his staff are happy to answer any questions. The marina is a short walk with a few restaurants where you can enjoy a great Moroccan, French or Spanish meal overlooking the bay. The hotel has a great location for walking to restaurants, café’s, bakery’s, beach and shopping. There is a money exchange right across the street from the hotel. My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay here and highly recommend the Hotel El Djenina…",Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2018,4,New and clean hotel,This hotel was quite very clean. We stayed there in December but I guess there is no AC. Wifi working very well. I would recommend to stay in the room facing not to the street as it was quite noisy over night. The staff was very friendly and helpful.,Hotel_El_Djenina-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
