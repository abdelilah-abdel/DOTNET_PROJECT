 December 2022,5,"If you want service before, during and after your stay, the Movenpick Casablanca is the hotel you want.","In late November I flew into Casablanca to begin a 24-day tour of the country. But I needed to leave some baggage in Casablanca; I needed a few other things too. I was looking at the cheaper hotels, but then decided that a full-service hotel was the way to go. Smartest decision I made this trip! The way I knew that this was a full-service hotel is that, before selecting a hotel, I emailed the Movenpick Casablanca with a few questions; they replied with thoughtful answers. I asked about getting my big box from the airport; got a quick reply. I asked if there were ATMs at the airport, as I had heard; another quick reply. A week AFTER I left the hotel I received an email from them, asking how was my trip was going, and inviting me to reach out to the Movenpick Casablanca if any…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We must admit to being excited when we found out where lunch was being hosted as we know Movenpick is a top end hotel. We were not disappointed. The hotel foyer is beautiful and we sneaked a peak into their stunning breakfast room. We headed upstairs to one of the function rooms for a luscious Moroccan feast including a beef tagine which included pineapple - wow! A first with us but we are firm fans of all the tagines that come with fruit or nuts. The staff were super friendly including an older Moroccan man who was on the buffet staff and ensured that we had top ups of wine and coffee and was simply charming.

 September 2022,4,Very friendly hotel in a busy part of the city,"Overall we were quite happy with our stay. In particular the concierge, Mr Hassan, was super helpful as our bags were lost by the airline. He continuously kept us up to date and called the airport twice a day to check on the progress of our bags. The location, however, wasn't ideal for a family trip. The crossroad on which the hotel is located is very congested with traffic and there is limited loading / unloading zones. The tram line is also right in front of the hotel, so it could be a good location for the business traveller. The rooftop bar was very cool, but the servers were not always available to take orders and help the clientele. The beds are nice and comfortable and the decor is quite up to date.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2022,3,"Some Good, Some Not-So-Good","Located in the business center of the city, this could have been perfect. However, the streets on either side of it were quite busy & noisy. The rooms were sound-proof so that helped. It didn't make moving around the vicinity very good because it was a high-traffic area. Our tour bus could not even stop for very long. Porters & Front Desk staff were efficient. The modern decor and the color theme of grey and black would have been something I really like but because the hotel and the rooms were small, the color made it seem even smaller. The black-grey color theme for the rooms just made them visually and actually cramped. So, this didn't work for me.

 May 2022,3,Definitely not a Movenpick,"Nicely located in the central business district of Casablanca, this hotel should probably have been brought down and rebuilt 30 years ago. The ground floor looks vaguely OK, but once you are on the rooms floors, it feels like you are back in 1980. Everything is depressingly grey, the walls are stained, the furniture is chipped... noise insulation is non existent and there is obviously a disco not far away with loud music till early morning. The staff does what they can and the breakfast is rather good, but it can not save an altogether depressing experience.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2022,4,Not great but good,Pretty good location next to the tram. Or taxis to everything. Sortrice and Ziwed do a good job on the room. Breakfast was plentiful but not hot. Pool was refreshingly cold but the one ladder was broken and you needed to pole vault out. AC was not adjustable so the room stayed warm ( maybe I didn’t know how to work it). Receptionist were all polite. Overall barely a 4.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2022,5,A Good Choice,"Arrived early at this hotel but dealt with by a very friendly, and professional receptionist called Fatima Alki . She was welcoming and sorted my room very quickly. The hotel had a nice feel about and my room was modern, clean and well equipped. I ate in the 16th floor restaurant and had an excellent meal and would happily eat their again. The hotel is ideally located near a tram stop ( to save westerners being taken advantage by less than honest taxi drivers) Overall a really good visit started by being dealt with by Faima who continued to provide great service throughout.

I was their on a business trip with 11 other people and everyone had the same experience, hellish !! The rooms had mold, they smelled are were very dirty, when you asked to be moved you got worse. Be ready to party because every night you can here the dj music until 3am, dont' bother moving, it is heard from every room.

 February 2020,1,Very disappointed and disgusted,"I stayed here for three nights for business. The hotel room was super dirty and smelled like mold. The bathroom had water damage and was growing mold on the ceiling. The cleaning service never replaced my water- in fact I was almost done with the first bottle I received and when they cleaned the next day, they just put the “complimentary sign” back on the used water bottle. They also did not replenish the vanity kit that was clearly used. They just put the empty box back in place as if they refilled it. The part that made me the most mad was when I can back to my hotel room on day three with the “do not disturb” sign. They took the sign down, cleaned part of my room and then left a clear display of opening and using my perfume that I had zipped up in a bag. Will never be…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2020,2,Needs some TLC,"Stayed here for 3 nights on a prepaid business trip, if it weren't a time consuming headache, I would've switched hotels. The entire place needs some urgent TLC, as others have stated- the smell of sewage is apparent on most of the floors. A lot of spot cleaning going on, with an obvious lack of deep cleaning. Careful of the elevators, some shake so bad or door creaks open so slowly it's completely possible someone will get trapped inside. Egg station workers not using gloves and one fork to mix all requests as well as transfer finished items to plates. No ATM on site, nor did they have enough cash to exchange money. All of the staff I encountered were extremely friendly, it's obvious that they have to apologize for the state of the hotel often.

 November 2019,4,Very Helpful Concierge Staff,"The Concierge Zouhdy merits a special mention. He was most helpful and accommodating to these first visitors to Casablanca. He couldn't help us enough which was very rewarding. This hotel was good. The rooms were pleasant and all the amenities were available. What let the hotel down was the restaurant on the 16th floor - well the night we were there. It was cold being open to the sky. It was noisy, the stereo was turned up too high. The food was disappointing ( no choice of soup, either chicken or fish, and no choice of desert, just a plate full of chopped up apples) The fish was soggy. I would recommend going to the other restaurants in the Hotel (not open when we were there). Very good choice for Breakfast.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2020,5,Exceeded expectations,"I spent 3 nights here early January. The Manager was softly spoken and highly, highly obliging when the Receptionist had me waiting 45 minutes because she couldn't process the deposit on my debit card. I was upgraded to the 14th floor which meant I was given a nicer room than my 280 euros had given me but beware of noise from above - music and chairs scraping from the conference facilities on the 15th floor. Now to the best bit. The Chambermaid that serviced my room on my 2nd day, I am told, was called Sumaya. This lady was sent by God as an Angel to set the standards for the lucky few that can see the difference.

 January 2020,2,Should not have the Movenpick Name,"If this was a normal two star hotel, I would say that everything was fine, but this is a Movenpick Hotel chain that does better than fine, and we expected that. We would say our stay was more akin to a Best Western or Holiday Inn rather than a Movenpick. However, we booked Movenpick because we are always impressed by the attention to detail by the staff, excellent service, and delicious breakfast buffet. The staff were not very helpful. It was my birthday, and I wanted a pedicure. Unfortunately, nowhere in the room was there a number to call the salon. So I walked upstairs, and waited over 20 minutes, and no receptionists or staff of the spa appeared. I spoke to someone in the bar, explaining I just wanted to book an appointment.

When we arrived, the front desk staff gave us a room that was still occupied. It was a non-issue so we just went back and got a different room. It turned out our new room (#501) was huge but needs a major overhaul. The fixtures have seen its days and the carpet was filthy. The hallway was rundown with wall panels coming off the seam and the worst part was the nauseous smell of sewage which the hotel tried to mask with a diffuser.

The hall ways had a very strange smell which at one stage resembled very strong stale fish, causing some American tourists I overheard to have to move floors. The elevators are also a variable feast and one afternoon it took me 20 minutes to get from the lobby to my room (only one lift was semi-working and my room keycard had been cancelled necessitating a slow trip back to reception).

The water in the bath was barely luke warm and they did not provide a washcloth for bathing. The barely warm water did not make for an inviting shower. The bathroom door wouldn’t shut all the way without getting stuck. Worst of all, there was some kind of weird techno music in the lounge from 11pm to 3 am that woke us every night.

Would definitely recommend.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,5,Wonderful hotel,"I recently spent a couple of nights at the Mövenpick Casablanca along with my 2 toddlers and sister. We stayed in 1414, I think it's the executive suite but Im not sure. Either way it was a lovely room with a spacious bathroom and a jacuzzi. Even though I always prefer a shower when living away the jacuzzi was a huge hit with the children. It sure took a while to fill the bathtub so make sure you put the tap on early. The bedroom was nice and cozy with a blurred glas wall facing the bathroom. Big TV with a good selection of channels. The living room area Was surprisingly large. Staff is great, every single employee. However Kawtar, the woman who checked us in is a real star. Very kind and super service minded. Thank you for a pleasant stay. We will definitely visit again.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 July 2019,4,Rooftop pool and view is spectacular,"Liked the location. About a 15 minute walk to the old city. Also right by a tram station (costs about 7 dhirem). We took the tram to Ain Diab beach (must change to yellow line) then walked along the boardwalk to Morocco mall which was amazing! Inside the mall there is a fountain and aquarium. Everything looked very new and modern (except the washroom which needs updating). The hotel room was good except the shower door was very poorly designed. Water gets all over the floor when you shower. Awful design! Also, I asked for an extra roll of toilet paper and the cleaning lady said you only get 2. I was shocked! I have never been declined extra toilet paper at any hotel I have stayed at! That was ridiculous! The room itself is spacious but the beds are a bit hard. Tip: if you want…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Location is in the city centre but there are lots of better hotels in the area.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,3,Lovely Staff compensate for issues,"We had some booking issues with the hotel for our group of around 25 which caused some of our guests quite a bit of discomfort. Despite this, I was impressed by the friendliness of most of the staff who spoke very good English and were always smiling.

 June 2019,3,Average - Unremarkable,"I stayed here for two nights on 05/30 - 06/01/19. The hotel is located in the commercial district and the tram for commuters is literally right outside the front door. The hotel is large with many floors and a rooftop pool and bar. Check-in was quick and easy. The staff were very nice. I had a room on the 4th floor but it nearly drove me crazy because it was so noisy - near the street and you could hear every honking car! There is a lot of honking too! If you stay here, get a high floor. I did not have a view except of the street. Nothing pretty here. Overall the staff was nice. The breakfast buffet was not included in the room rate and it was an additional 20 Euros. The breakfast was very good and they had a better than average spread of everything you could want.…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2019,3,Look else where,I was disappointed with Movenpick Casablanca. This is an older hotel in need of some serious refurbishment. Pool area and furnishings very sad. Rooms ordinary. Casablanca must have better to offer than this.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,5,Loved it,I stayef at movenpick casa for busines purpose. I liked the check in process the guy humbly took care of my car and lignage and walked me to my room.

 June 2019,3,Not a 5 stars hotel,"My first room was in a very bad condition, with shower broken, curtains broken and even a table broken. I changed room and it was a bit better, but rooms are faded and need a to be refreshed. Service is ok and people try to make you happy ou to help you. Breakfast is ok, with a large offer. But I know Movenpick, and here we do not have 5 stars. This is is correct 3-4 stars.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2019,4,Wonderful Hotel!,"I came to the Movenpick as a host or a large group and they, especially the 16th floor staff went above and beyond to accommodate my group! From a surprise DJ for our event to extra food and beverages, a great staff for a great hotel. The restaurant staff was delightful as well. Many thanks!!!",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2019,2,Is this a 5 Star Hotel?,"While we did not have a bad experience with the hotel, it is still surprising that this is a 5 star hotel. The lobby is average, the elevator is old and slow, service is dependent on who is at the counter. Even the Mint Tea at the 16th floor bar is too overpriced. Location is not that good for tourists Good things about the hotel: the bed is large, breakfast food is ok, the transportation people and the bellhops were professional. Location maybe good for those in town for business. Overall, hotel is OK but lower your expectations, it is not 5 stars by any stretch of the imagination.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Old furniture, smell of old in the room. The breakfast is always the same. The breakfast is until 10.30 in te morning. After 10.40. , in every morning, someone from the stuff said us we must leave the restaurant because they must prepare the lunch.

 April 2019,3,Typical big City hotel,"I would say this hotel is in between a 3 and a 4, but I can’t go half numbers, so I’ll have to go with the lower number. It is a up to western standards hotel that serves its purpose if you’re looking for western commodities for personal hygiene as well as for a good night’s rest. It is atypical of your big city hotel, basically is you forgot you were in Morocco you could have seen this hotel in any other big city. I didn’t take many pictures because there wasn’t anything that blew my mind away for the exception of the artwork pictured and us watching the Game of Thrones season premiere during breakfast. This place serves the purpose for a enjoyable visit to go sightseeing in Casablanca.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,3,Nice roof top terrasse,Clean room. Check in is a drag. No shower curtains or doors so water went all over the bathroom floor. There is a Nice roof top terrasse with pool.

 April 2019,4,A Nice Experience in Casablanca,"We have been in Casablanca for three nights and have stayed at this hotel. It is more than adequate but a little tired in the foyers. Our room was fine with sweeping views of the city. It was clean, a comfortable bed and good bathroom with plenty of products, safe, wifi etc. All that you would expect from a business hotel. All staff were courteous and helpful which was great as we have no Moroccan and little French language skills. THe hotel gym was a little small but adequate. The buffet breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and good coffee. THe real highlight was the 16th floor restaurant and pool. It was an excellent spot to enjoy some sun around the pool whilst enjoying a coffee or a drink. We had two dinners at the restaurant and Sayed and his team really…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,5,Room and Hotel Service,I’ve been at the hotel for two weeks and I have to say I’ve been really impressed by the service provided by the staff.

I’ve overall really impressed by the service.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,4,Modern with middle-eastern hospitality,"The room was comfortable and well-appointed. It is not super-modern deluxe but not Third World either. The staff was pleasant, the hot water was sufficient and the bed was comfortable. The restaurant was pleasant, and dinner the night of our arrival was Swiss night, served buffet style. Movenpick was always a Howard Johnson type of hotel which became more fashionable, so if you view it from that point of view you will get the proper perspective. (it is not a Ritz Carlton, for example, or a Hilton...)",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,1,"Nothing worth a 5 star, below Movenpick standards","Very unpleasant surprise as this hotel clearly does not meet the Movenpick standards. Where to start? Room: very old style, tired bedside lighting appliances falling from the wall but kind of new carpet and new flat screen TV. Very poor selection of channels for a 5 star (no Canal+ which can be found in some 3 star hotels here) , no Bein sport either, mostly free channels!!!) Decent wifi Bathroom: vanity mirror barely staying fixed in the wall, threadbare old towels, , chipped tiles, not very clean (chewing gum on the floor and hair in bath) Breakfast: very small room with max 50 seats for a 16 floor hotel!

 March 2019,4,In need of a makeover :>(,"For my first (and last) tour with Globus, I arrived a day early and booked a room through an online service. I then contacted the manager asking that to occupy the same room as had been scheduled for the one-night stay with the Globus tour. I prefer this to changing rooms, and know that it saves resources (laundry, housekeeping staff). Every request was honored, including a room on an upper floor, room 1014. I stayed in a different room when the tour ended the following Friday, thus the last three accompanying photos depict different furnishings. Upon arriving that March Saturday afternoon, a doorman greeted me with a smile when opening the door. How civilized!

 March 2019,1,Very Disappointing,"We were booked at The Kensi hotel but they did not honor our reservation due to the king visiting and sent us to the Movenpick Hotel , telling us it was a 5 star hotel. The hotel had a bad odor on our floor, smelt like sewage. The roof top restaurant and pool were nice but all of the tables were dirty, none had been cleaned after people left. We went to dinner at 7pm and were the only people there. We were a family of 4. We ordered soup for an appetizer and our meal. By 8:15, we had not received our soup yet. After complaining, we waited until 8:30 and left. Worst service we had ever seen. This is not a 5 star hotel, it barely makes a 3 star. BEWARE",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,3,Not enough for 5 stars,I am staying here for 3 days and stay 3 days more. Reception and breakfast was excellent. And it is near to the light train. And very good location. Rooms are also good but maintanence is not enough for 5 star. I had electricity problem. In my room when I open and if I close all light when I want to sleep. All electric is going and nothing works. In a day 3 times I informed reception to send somebody. And one night I did morning without electric. Also today the sink was bloked morning. When I came night it was the same how I left. Also no water for complimentary. And no hand towels. Maybe they came to clean and somebody call them after they forget to come back.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2019,3,our first introduction to Casablanca,this hotel is in a very busy and noisy corner. the rooms are odd shape and our room (#404) faced the next building's offices. the breakfast spread was disappointing and the dinner on the 16th floor (pool deck) was dampened by the strong cold wind entering the restaurant. it was unpleasant sitting there for a meal when the cold wind keeps coming in through the gaps on the glass panels. staff members at the check in were stern faced.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,4,A great business hotel in the city,"We stayed here for our last 2 nights of our trip. The rooms are spacious, clean and well decorated in this pleasant hotel that offers great value for money compared to others in its category. We opted to stay here rather than along the Corniche and that was a great decision as the hotels along the Corniche looked pretty dismal. Check in was fast even though we arrived an hour earlier than the check in time. Staff were always friendly and very helpful. Having the tram right across the hotel is a huge advantage (you can get to the Corniche simply and for less than a taxi) and there are lots of good restaurants in the neighbourhood. Try the famous ice cream parlour down the street or the burger joint just around the corner.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,5,"Despite heavy pressure, the personnel still made it work :-)","On one of the evneings during my stay I decided to have lunch in the restaurant on the ground floor. Apparently two large groups were also coming to the resto and consequently only a buffet service was available and not the usual A-la-carte menu. The restaurant was clearly understaffed (I don't understand this approach from the management), but Idrissi and Azekri managed to get everyine served and kept doing that with a smile and flair. Thanks to both of you, but management shoudl really take a look at the staffing when large groups are coming.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,4,Family Vacation for Chinese New Year 2019,Good location in the business district of Casablanca. Design of the hotel has a Moroccan feel and I like the smell of the hotel surrounding (some kind of flowery scent). Breakfast spread was satisfying with Moroccan cuisine as well as international. The buffet dinner was similar with mixture of Moroccan cuisine and continental fusion.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,5,Very good business center and meeting rooms,"Our company often rents meeting rooms in this hotel and service here is always perfect. The responsible person for the meeting center is always at your disposal and helps wherever he can. (Some items were forgotten and he came to bring them back to us.) During coffee breaks, there are always snacks (morrocan cookies, fruits) and drinks (morrocan mint tea, coffee,...) foreseen at the exact timing you ask for them.

Breakfast is good, basic and not a huge choice, but what is there is very nice and presented well. The room is great, very big and lovely big bathroom. All clean and i like that they give you the option to not have your bed sheets cleaned every day (to reduce washing/ carbon footprint etc) by just placing a small piece of card provided on the bed. It is still made... just not sheets changed which was fine by me for 3 nights.

Again the staff were exceptional, when we wanted to eat in the fine dining restaurant but couldn’t because of a private booking it wasn’t a problem.

It’s decor is tired with chipped doors and stained carpets, the non smoking floors smell of smoke, the breakfast is average at best (and be prepared to eat yoghurt with a fork) and the room service and drinks way over-priced. Our junior suites on 14th floor were directly under the pool so all you hear is gurgling - it’s like sleeping inside a fish tank.

 November 2018,3,Decent but Disappointing,"This is a fine hotel centrally located in Casablanca: clean, comfortable spacious rooms with good sized baths. The price is very reasonable by European standards, and only a tad expensive by Moroccan. Restaurant buffet food is interesting and diverse. Any given dish may or may not be to your personal taste, but there's always something good to eat. The staff is friendly and speaks French well. Many, though not all, also speak English. I presume Arabic works too though I have no way of judging that. The street noise is a bit excessive, even from high floors; and front desk staff warned us not to drink the tap water; but that's fairly standard for Morocco. I doubt you'll do better elsewhere in Casablanca. So why do I call it disappointing? If the Movenpick had stopped with good…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,4,Nice stay in Casablanca,"Recently spent two nights at this fine hotel. Centrally located the room was quite pleasant, modern, clean, with big comfortable bed, pillows and linen. Nice modern bathroom. Towels were a bit disappointing though. Small pool on the 16th floor with nice views. We were on a lower floor with no view. Free WIFI. Just a great place to relax after a long day in Casablanca.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,4,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel with all the basic enmity including a pool. Although I didn’t use it, it was very inviting. Hotel is 45 minutes from Mohammed International Airport. Hotel was clean, receptionists and staff friendly. It was a good 2 night stay",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,1,Absurdo,"What you would expect from a hotel is that you can sleep. They hosted us on the second floor when in a first there was a wedding party with percussion instruments and singers that ended 3am. Upon returning from the tour we returned to stay, asked to be allocated on a high floor, at breakfast we took a bowel infection that took us to the hospital on our return. I fainted 4 times on the flight. The facilities are good, but as they know we will not be back so early, they treat the tourist horribly.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,2,Night life,The roof top Bar ls very modern with good selections of spirits and food The only remark i had is the service is very poor compare it by the same flagship movenpick in middle east like Dubai . Need more training on customer service,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,3,Average,Pros: can’t get enough of their fresh orange juice and fresh pomegranate seeds at breakfast; WIFI is steady and reliable; room was a good size for 2-3 people; 2 comp water bottles per day; there is a bar on the top floor Cons: not close to any walkable tourist attraction; the gigantic Mosque is 30-40 min bus ride away depending on traffic; shower is either too cold or too hot and water temperature fluctuates so drastically several times while in use. Maybe they have a shortage of hair dryers because on 2 separate occasions we had to call front desk for a hair dryer. On our 1st night all the lights were working fine throughout the room but the electrical outlets are not working so we had to call technician who reset the circuit breaker so we can plug our chargers.

 October 2018,2,Poor Standard of Service,"The hotel services and description is not as advertised on expedia. The hotel is situated on the main road, all far from the tourist areas of interest. The room standard is poor, although the description says iron, kettle, tv provided in the room, this is not true. The tv did not work, there was no kettle in the room although there were tea cups and tea bags, the minibar was completely empty, and there was no iron only the ironing board was provided. The ac did not work, the bathroom extractor did not work. We repeatedly reported these areas to the reception, but nothing was done. When we checked out the reception charged for full stay although we have already paid via expedia. We had to point out that we have already paid for the stay, they also asked if we had anything from…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,2,Disappointing & very expensive,"Visited Casablanca in May and stayed at the Movenpick for two nights. Location was great and the size of rooms spacious. However, the images on the website don’t reflect the reality, hotel was clean but in if refurbishment, definitely overpriced ant not value for money. Good breakfast and roof top with pool offers spectacular views over the city. ❤️Casablanca",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,3,Not realy a movenpick hotel,"we did stay in many 5 star hotel but not realy like that one the hotel is old , so the room are not so nice as like hotel 5 stars the noise , the service too well i think the management must do some work to make the service better and the room as well.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,1,Worst experience,"This hotel lacks the basics relating to proper hospitality management. They are ill equipped to deal with large groups and the food is of very low quality. The rooms were dirty on arrival, toiletries half used were strewn everywhere and the mini bars were raided. I would recommend you do not stay at this hotel.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2018,1,Poor customer service,I don’t know how this place has scored those reviews. It’s a shame the movenpick group has put its name to this place. The reception and customer service and the standard of the rooms is just looks with no substance. I have stayed at Club Val de Anfa before and it is by far better than this poor place. I will never stay here please don’t be fooled by the Movenpick sign.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,3,Busy city center hotel,"My sister and I made the Mövenpick our “home-base” while exploring the area with a rental car. The valet service is great, the staff is very helpful, and the food is delicious, however, there were a couple of hick-ups: (1) our room was not available on arrival and we were down-graded with to a smaller room and a king sized bed ( we asked for two twins). Our room was available the next day and we were moved. (2) Light bulbs in both rooms were flicking (3) Hot water kettle was broken and it took five attempts to have it replaced (4) Beautiful 16th floor pool environment was diminished by loud, hideous techno music. Overall, it was a nice stay but not equivalent to a 5-star experience.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2018,5,Excellent hotel with outstanding staff.,"Excellent customer service! Upon check-in we received a complimemtary upgrade! Our room was great and the bed very comfortable - it was the best sleep my husband had during our entire trip. Great rooftop views, I took many aerial shots. Our only critique would be the set up of the pool - it's a little crammed with people facing you as you swim, but we still enjoyed our time in the area - the amazing views made up for this and there is a bar if you are so inclined. We walked about 35 mins to the Corniche area, but the hotel is very close to the old town and souks (which we didnt have time to see). Tram stop outside the hotel and plenty of taxis. We need to mention that ALL staff made our stay phenomenal, reception, concierge, restaurant - but extra special mention to Driss at…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2018,4,Great for a quick stay!,"My friend and I stayed here for an overnight layover. The staff was really friendly and they have 24-hour room service which was great after arriving late. The breakfast that's included far exceeds any hotel breakfast buffet I've ever seen! They even had fresh juices like beet, carrot, and green juice in addition to the ubiquitous jus d'orange. After a short hang at the pool, I went to the spa for a hammam. The woman who provided my service was so nice and professional and even held my phone for me when I forgot it in a rush to the airport!",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 August 2018,1,Aweful experiance!!!,"One of the worst stays ever in any hotel. Movenpick Casablanca claims to be a 5 star. All doors are broken, water leaking from bathrooms, flooding bathrooms, stinking rooms, stinking passageways, horrible housekeeping, stern and rough reception, very rude and poor quality staff. This is the last and final time ever we have stayed in Movenpick. Our child got locked in the rooms since he doors had broken handles After 30 minutes the housekeeping team came for rescue ! Reflection staff stopped attending to calls inspite of calling 20 tines. The duty manager was extremely bad and arrogant. When I said I shall complain they said DO WHAT YOU WANT ! This is very very bad for any hotel chain.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2018,2,Cutting corners and understaffed,"We are well travelled family of three and having been across four countries in the past 3 weeks we thought we would have a relaxing luxurious end to our travels before heading back to our Abu Dhabi home base. So we booked an executive suite at the Movenpick in Casablanca who advertised the usual extra benefits of spending the addition dollars on executive privileges. Sadly they did not deliver on the basics let alone the expectation of 5 star hotels. The issues: 1: Doorman was to busy smoking, to acknowledge us or even welcome us 2: No functioning executive lounge (see photo’s) 3: Minimal breakfast- one day we had an omelet chef, next day no omelet chef; no bowls; no spoons; no coffee and tea offers… 4: Room service- no answer on the phone for 50…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 July 2018,2,"Good location, nice re-designed bathroom but the service...","I spent 2 nights in the Movenpick for business. Centrally located downtown, we were able to walk to our business meetings without experiencing the petit or grand taxi. Rooms were OK but need some remodeling and refurbishment, except for the bathroom. The problem as other hotels in the region is the level of service: a large number of waiters in the breakfast area discussing among themselves without really paying attention to client needs; a restaurant on the rooftop when you wait forever for the menu: mustard and mayonnaise never came. Obviously could do better ....",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2018,3,Nice rooms,"Though the room was nice here, the service was pretty average. We arrived there at 12 and hoped to check in early as many hotels, if they have a room available, will give it to you. We were told that if we wished to check in early, it would cost us 600 dirhams. In addition, the housekeeping staff intruded our room at 8am on the day of our check out, whilst we were still in bed. Not impressed.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 July 2018,4,Stayed there on our last night as a way to be close to the airport,"This is a very nice western style business hotel. The amenities are exactly what you'd expect from a solid business hotel. Very nice rooms - clean and modern with all working amenities. A very professional staff that clearly cater to an international business clientele. The business center works well - very good wifi, etc. My only complaint is that the restaurants are super expensive and definitely not worth it. Very bland and boring food. Walk a couple of blocks and eat elsewhere. This is not a fun or interesting place for a vacation vibe. It's no nonsense, high-end business - and it does that very well.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The service was ok (neither slow or quick) but it was always an item missing when we ordered food/drinks, no joke every single time - however this could of course be a language barrier. The location however was brilliant as its a walking distance to most tourist attractions in the city.

After taking a cab from the train station, we arrived at the front desk where we were informed that the hotel was overbooked and our room was unavailable. Keep in mind that we had already booked and prepaid our stay THREE MONTHS in advance. The gentleman at the front desk was incredibly rude when I pushed back, even raising his voice at me. He then informed us that a Movenpick staffer would drive us “5 minutes” to a different hotel that would accommodate us. This was all after we had been traveling from Marrakech for several hours and were exhausted, and had already paid a cab to Movenpick.

After complaining and venturing around the hotel for thirty minutes to find somewhere to eat. We were forced to eat off an appetizer menu in the business center.When you are in a country where you don't speak the local language you stay at hotels and rely on their services because you might not want to venture out by yourself.

 April 2018,3,Mixed Thoughts - Clean and Close to centre but...,"We were satisfied with our stays at the Movenpick, but not overwhelmed. Maybe we were expecting too much. The biggest plus is location. It is not far from the city centre and most major sights, and right beside the tram line. Location is definitely an advantage. The rooms were variable. It seems like perhaps they are going through renovation. We had rooms on two different floors on each occasion. A couple of the floors were nice and the rooms were good. Other floors seemed rundown and in desperate need of repair. One floor was positively icky. If they are in the midst of renovation, be sure to ask for the newly renovated floors. There is a very nice rooftop deck with a small pool. Drinks were predictably expensive but it's a rooftop bar in a western-style hotel so we pretty…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2018,1,Hotel scams you. Be careful,The hotel was fine itself but upon check in they told us we were upgraded free of charge and breakfast was now included. I had confirmed the breakfast was free since our original booking did not have that. The receptionist had reassured with the upgrade it was. Next morning we have breakfast (definitely not even worth it) and they charge us 400 and tell us we were making it up. Reading previous reviews it seems like they scam people all the time with the free breaskfast and then end up charging everyone. Biggest scammers in casablanca.

To our disappointment we found out that the groups were placed at the old rooms , not the renovated ones. Our room no:302 was quite spacious though with lots of amenities but the materials are old and tired. The biggest shenanigan was kept in the breakfast. Although we were informed that all meals are taking place at a large hall in the ground floor, next morning we were guided to the first floor, where the so call breakfast buffet was offered far less products and quality than the one in the ground floor.

 January 2018,3,Decent hotel - Centrally Located,"I booked my stay through the hotel website and had taken the early check in option. However when we reached the hotel they didn't have the room ready, you can assume the frustration of not having a room after a 8+ hour long flight. Having said that, the reception staff who was initially 'cold' did upgrade my stay in to a two bedroom apartment. The apartment itself was nice, no real view as it faces the building next to it. Room service menu was pretty limited in choice. They have nice little bar by the pool on the rooftop, again decent nothing great.

 January 2018,2,Not 5*. Never.,"This hotel would be OK if it was advertised as a high 3* or a low 4* but to call it 5* is delusional. The worst issue is the breakfast. A poor choice, badly cooked and lukewarm. I arrived as a large Chinese tour group had fully depleted the limited breakfast buffet and the staff were unable to replenish it promptly. There was virtually no food, no coffee, no milk, no plates, etc. If the buffet had been of suitable 5* quality to begin with, the tour group could have been easily accommodated without leading to problems for other guests. But the buffet is so far below expectations, there is no way it could cope. The management here need to visit other 5* hotels in the region to find out how it should be done. I notice the manager responded to a previous complaint with a…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We were outside for 45 minutes while the two bus drivers were arguing, Finally We have to move out all of our suitcases out to the street and wait outside in the middle of a very cold morning for our bus, we even have to argued with the police so we could board our bus, it was a very bizarre situation, The manager of the Hotel did want to help us, He could request the driver of the other bus to move it out since it was on the Hotel property,…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The hotel is located at a busy intersection with a lot of car traffic, but we were on a high floor so the noise from the street didn't bother us. What bothered was the noise coming from the 16th floor (we were on the 14th floor). The hotel has a lounge/restaurant located on the 16th floor so I suspect that was the source of the noise. Entire night we could hear sounds of people moving things or rolling things around on the floor above us. Needless to say I didn't get a good sleep.

TV however didn't have interesting channels...not a problem though :) The top roof terrace is nice and offers a beautiful view on the city. The hotel is very central but has no parking; I had to leave my car in the street, which was a bit annoying due to the absence of security at night The restaurant was nice, and staff helpful, but the food was 300% bad and not always fresh: potatoes from the day before, hair found in my plate twice which means people in the kitchen were not wearing caps, not enough food for everbody; we happened to enter the restaurant and find empty containers and we didn't have time to wait until they were refilled, lunch was always cold, fruits were not fresh...…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Even before I book the room I already had problem with them not responding to my email which was really frustrating but still I decided to book with them.

Also the concierge failed to inform the taxi driver on the right location (we were supposed to go to Basmane restaurant which the concierge booked for us that day, but told the taxi driver to Le Petite Rocher restaurant instead) so we ended up at the wrong restaurant - Hotel had a money exchange service at reception.

 November 2017,4,Not great location,"It was a nice hotel but not in a good location. The buffet breakfast would have cost 20 euros per person. We walked across the street and had a good breakfast for much less at a place called?? Red Cafe or ??. The hotel was not close to the train station. We stayed three nights in Morocco (Casablanca - Marrakech - Casablanca). If I were to spend three nights again I would skip Casablanca. It was a very big city with little charm. I liked the movie much better than the city! We used Roundtrip for Hotels in Casablanca to get to and from the airport.

 November 2017,1,Disappointed..,"Let's start by saying if you were thinking about staying here, PLEASE think again. I don't think it's much to expect a double occupancy room to have a bathroom door that I can close without having to wrestle with. It would also be nice to have two bathrobes and not one. Breakfast looks quite nice on the face of it. However, once we sat there was nothing nice about it. Fried eggs were burnt from one side and raw from the other (definitely not what i asked for), pastry was from the night before at best. Had to share salt and pepper with one other table because there wasn't any more of that. Asked for a spoon the moment I sat down and did not get one at all..

Others who are with me on this business trip had complained about sewage smell in their rooms or very small rooms. Luckily I didn’t. Casablanca in general has “apparently” sewage infrastructure problems. Walking in the streets means you have to smell sewage all the time. The food was just ok @ the Movenpick ... nothing extra.

 October 2017,1,Do not recommend,"Not recommended for any type of stay.. The hotel is in a very busy and noisy cross road. Pros: friendly staff, beds were clean and AC worked.

I don't think there was any technical difficulties for they did check in 2 other guests. I think they were overbooked. Looks like we were not the first to experience this. I just saw another review in Expedia who had the same experience. Front desk staff was very indifferent and were not even sorry for the inconvenience caused. The hotel that they moved us into was ok.

There was a big Chinese tour group during my stay and when I went down for breakfast at 8:30am, most of the food was gone and tables were uncleared.

We did not understand why he had to take our passport if the hotel was oversold. We booked this room very early so we had a good rate and I think they thought the price was low, so he rathered put us in another hotel that he can make more in their own instead.

 September 2017,3,Just average with good staff.,Arrived at 8am and they had our rooms ready. Was only here for one night on a tour of Morocco. The breakfast was rough. I scraped together some breads with butter and a chicken dish that looked like it should have been for dinner. The location was good and the pool bar on the 16th floor was pretty cool. I would probably try another hotel if I visited Casablanca again. Staff were really nice.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2017,3,"Unfortunately, not again","Check in at the Movenpick was quick and easy, we were greeted kindly. I had booked a room with a great view of the city as I was celebrating a milestone birthday. We were placed on the 6th floor and the view not so great. The room - the room was okay, nothing over the top great, there are some lipstick and mascara mistakes but not anything really bad. The bed - one word ""great"". The windows cannot be opened and there are two sets of windows (rather disappointing) The bathroom - clean no real issues except when you have a shower, it is open concept and a lot of the shower water lands up on the floor. The really nice thing about this hotel - The 16th floor (the roof) is amazing, the pool is beautiful and clean and the view of the city is exceptional.

They are also equipped with an iron and a mini bar, unfortunately a hair dryer was missing. There is also a WIFI network available which worked fine. Check in and out procedures were unproblematic and quick. It is located in the center of the city so the major sights of Casablanca are easily reachable by foot. The personnell at the reception was also nice and helpful, they recommended an excellent authentic Moroccan restaurant and helped us planning our one day trip from Casablanca to Rabat by taxi. The rooftop bar and pool on the 16th floor with an awesome view over the city itself is pretty nice and stylish. It was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel.

 August 2017,3,A bit expensive for what it is,"Service at reception could be better, more enthusiastic. Staff at the pool bar did not acknowledge us in 15 minutes, after which we had to go and get the cocktail menu ourselves. Also, it is a shame that the windows at the pool level were filthy. Although Casablanca does not particularly offer a breathtaking view, it would still be nice to look outside through clean windows. I received a wax treatment at the spa, it was excellent, I never had it made so well. However if I was concerned by my privacy I would have been horrified, during the time I was getting waxed( including full Brazilian) 2 other members of staff came in the room without warning, and the treatment was made half by one, half by another one.

Idea behind booking a hotel away from the office was to get a chance to explore the city while travelling to and from office and then stop by interesting places on the way back :). I stayed in this hotel for 12 days... the rooms were very clean, service was good. The best thing that i liked was the room was pretty silent given that the hotel is on the main road junction where you have at least 6-7 roads meeting which means lot of vehicles + trams passing every 5-10 minutes.

 July 2017,3,Services was not good,"the services was really bad & slow. But the hotel is clean. the pool side cafe is very slow & expensive. We ask for some to go breakfast they could not provide us.

 August 2017,3,Not movenpicks usual standard,"Ok so we stayed here for 4 days recently. All I can say about this hotel is that if your used to the standard of hotels in Dubai then you will be disappointed! It seems Moroccan standards are not the same as the same brands in the Middle East/Western Europe. We have stayed in marrakech and Agadir and finding this at Sofitel and other good hotel chains. The staff were friendly enough and room ok. The rooftop pool is very small and more like a bath tub. This hotel is situated in the heart of Casablanca, a heavily polluted city with not much to do, but great if your on business. My advice if your looking to holiday in this area is perhaps to stay in Anfa which is much nicer, and commutable for shopping mall, mosque, ricks cafe etc. The breakfasts were limited with only 2 cereals…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

In a little pool increadible loud music. The front office manager Mourad El Meliani doesn't respond to client request. Cannot keep calm, just show off and no solution. No any respect to foreigners.

 July 2017,4,"Nice place, But","The location of the hotel is very appropriate for a multipurpose stay in Casa. The overall experience is satisfactory but I will emphasize on some issues. I had to ask several times each time for my room to be cleaned. When the housekeeper passed in the morning (everyday) and I was still in my bedroom, I’d ask her to come back later on (that was usually at around 8-9); I’d come back to my chamber at 3 pm sometimes and find it not done yet. The room is quiet spacious, real nice, but lacks mirrors. A cover in the closet fell on the first day uncovering the electric box of the room. When I was leaving the bath tub, I was close to slipping because the bottom of the bathtub is 10 Centimeters higher than the bottom of the floor. There was only one soap in the bathroom.

Though the room keeping staff are friendly, they refilled different room amenities every day but never refilled the whole set. 2. The food and beverages at the pool restaurant are way overpriced. 100 durham for a glass of gin tonic and 140 for club sandwich (the taste was below average) excluding the service charge. 3. Breakfast was decent but with limited choices. Tips: If you don't want to be ripped off by taxi drivers, you can take the train to Gare de Casa Voyageurs. It costs 41 durhams.

We explained/argued our case to 4 different employees (over two hours of our vacation gone), but every reply was essentially ""We never said breakfast was free, it is your fault for thinking it was free"". To avoid this issue, we should not have trusted the hotel's word, because they denied it, and we didn't have proof.

With a Boulangerie right opposite the hotel it fails me why is the bread at breakfast so stale n sad. 1 type of cereal on offer . The chef has no idea on frying an egg or making a decent omelette.

Nothing wrong with these hotels, sometimes people travel in large groups. I don't. The service matches the hotel's type. We arrived early for an extended stay of 6 nights. Most hotels are happy to have that type of client, but not here. Since we were staying for so long, we reserved and prepaid for an upgraded deluxe room to have the extra space.

He made sure we were attended to every time we stepped foot in the restaurant, good thing about him he is multilingual so communication was easy for those of us who did'nt speak Arabic.

OK, but then when we ordered most of the dishes were unavailable.

The worst: there was dampness on the air conditioner. The first day it rained heavily and water filtered through the main window. The bathroom is very small, in fact could not fit the paper, you could not close the door. And it could have windows because the infrastructure allows it.

The Sofitel is probably the best followed by the Hyatt and Movenpick. This Movenpick falls way short of what might be expected of the brand. True, public spaces have been upgraded to a more contemporary style. Bathroom fixtures in the bedrooms have been improved (but no walk-in shower, still a tub). However, it looks like the old carpets and furniture in the bedrooms have been retained, the level of cleanliness is not what it should be and sloppy paint work is widely evident.

To sleep under the sound of running water is terrible and certainly not possible. After the complaints, we, of course, were resettled, but why it was necessary to settle in this number of people already at a young age is not clear. I had to drag all the things to another room at night. The night is broken and of course the mood is very bad. Also in the hotel regret shampoo, gel and soap for residents.

The pickup time of (3:00am) and price were confirmed and agreed upon up front. The hotel staff introduced us to the driver the day before which was nice. The hotel also gave the driver a written note with the pickup time and agreed upon price - which was all great. On the morning of the pickup the driver loaded our bags in the car and then stated that there was a problem that he needed to speak privately about.

 December 2016,4,"Nice Hotel, excellent staff","The centre of Casablanca is not ideal for holidaying but if you want good transport links and a reasonable selection of restaurants then I can recommend this hotel. The hotel is well kept, large comfortable rooms and all the staff are very helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast is a bit chaotic for my liking but there's a good selection of food. We had one meal in the basement restaurant which was good (did get a bit tired of the looped music though). There's a bar, a little pricey but pleasant and a small pool area on the roof with good views.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2017,3,Need more variety in food,"Was staying in king size bed room . Room was pretty good. Surprisingly had to remind housekeeping daily to provide water bottles. Used conference rooms on 15th floor and they were perfect for meetings. Breakfast is same daily and less variety of food items,hotel's management needs to re look at what all to be served every morning.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2017,5,"Very Nice Hotel, Amazing Restaurant Staff","While the hotel rooms were very nice and comfortable, the purpose of this review was a promise I made to the restaurant staff from the Casablanca Cafe (on the lobby floor). They comped our entire dinner bill and provided us with an ice-cream cake when they found out it was my father's birthday. I've never had an entire bill comped before anywhere, even here in the US. I apologize that I don't remember the staffs' names, but they were awesome, and we were very grateful for it. If it helps at all, I believe they were working the dinner shift on January 3rd.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,4,Very Good City Hotel,"If you want to be in the heart of Casablanca, this hotel is it. The view from the rooms on the top floors are wonderful. We had a suite which was very large, had a huge bathroom with windows over looking the city, great bath and very comfortable beds. Breakfast was fabulous, lots to choose from and healthy options as well. The gym was well equipped with a four treadmills, bikes, rowers and weights. Did have the morning breakfast smell to it though. Nice roof top pool that was far too cold to swim in though. Good children's menu and room service In all this is a good hotel for a stop in the city. Its not 5 star, but its a good 4 star.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2017,5,Awesome hotel!!,Movenpick is located in the middle of the hustle bustle of Casablanca. Conventionally located near public transit and major financial area of the city. The lobby is grand and have ample seating space of guests waiting for check in. The staff is extremely courteuos and ready to assist at all times. The room was spacious and well appointed. High quality soap and toiletries are used which is a testament to the hotel's commitment to take care of their guests. I am thoroughly impressed!,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2017,5,Excellent place to stay,"A really nice hotel with excellent staff. My room was clean and nice and I have zero complaints, would stay here again. One note - breakfast is overpriced so I would skip it. The rooftop bar was a great place to relax, wish I hadn't been there in winter so I could have used the pool.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2016,3,Average,"The hotel is in a nice location and overall satisfactory. Considering the star level and the price, it is actually not impressive and perhaps even disappointing. Nice bed, large room with a couch made my stay comfortable but I was annoyed by the clogged sink that collected water in the tub and made washing hands/face a pain. The room was a bit noisy. The carpet in the room and room furnishing are due for an overall rehab. Staff needs training in being available but not intrusive.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,4,Movenpick Casablanca,"Good base to explore Casablanca - rooms nice/functional, though fairly anonymous - location praqctical for both business and tourist visits - did not try restaurant - rooftop bar looked interesting - would go back",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,4,Comfortable Stay,"On our visit to Morocco recently, we visited the city of Casablanca and stayed there for couple of days. As we have always had a good experience with Movenpick. We chose to stay in Movenpick Hotel in Casablanca. The hotel is centrally located and very convenient to travel around the city from there. Our check-in happened quickly and efficiently. As we were a family of 4, we stayed in a big room. The room was very spacious and had the view of the city. Loved the size of cupboards, bathroom and other amenities. All the facilities like swimming pool, gym, spa, restaurants etc were great. We had a wonderful stay.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2017,3,Average,I highly recommend Fatema for promotion as she made our stay a lot better. Otherwise we would have complained and asked to speak with the General manager. Front Office - service a bit of a hit and miss.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2016,5,Casablanca feeling,"I have spend 2 days in this hotel when I was on a 2 weeks trip in Morocco. We have booked via a tour agency in Hungary. I dont how it happened exactly but at the reception we received the key for the casablanca junior suite. It was really funny to stay in casablanca at casablanca hotel, in the casablanca junior suite, drinking casablanca beer in the jacuzzi, but it was a really funny story and somwething I will allways remember.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,2,Not worth your money! A HUGE disappointment for the Movenpick hotel chain.,"We were two couples traveling and we paid for both rooms. Knowing that Movenpick is an excellent hotel brand throughout the Middle East, I had very high expectations. My first and last impression of the hotel staff is that they're trying their best. However, the hotel itself seems a bit outdated. We were looking forward to the rooftop pool that turned out to be quite small. Nevertheless, we tried to enjoy a meal at the restaurant, which turned out to be a very expensive endeavor. We were provided no menus whatsoever so we had no clue what the prices were for anything. The meal was so large that we should have shared it. In the end, we asked to have it packed. The staff was VERY hesitant to do this. For the prices we were paying, I would expect Heaven and Earth to move!…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,4,Overall good stay,"Overall good, the rooms lack a balcony and the service at the restaurants and cafes are really slow.

 December 2016,5,Great place to stay,"A very well located between city centre and the see side area, very close and accessible to all attractions and areas of interest.

I would definitely recommend this hotel for friends and family, and would consider it to be my choice of hotel to stay in Casablanca or any other city in Morocco.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,4,Nice hotel,"The hotel is well positioned in the center of Casablanca, close to main financial and touristic áreas. The personnel is correct, and in general romos are well sized. Swimming pool is a plus, though the wheather was cold during my stay. I enjoyed the fitness center, well equiped with mills and training machinery.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,5,Great Hotel at a Very Central Location,"This is quite a good hotel. Rooms are spacious and most importantly it's quite. Instead of double pane windows to filter out the traffic noise, they put 2 layers of windows, which is pretty fine with me. Internet connectivity is very good as well and they have pretty decent TV shows which kept me entertained when the weather was sour. The only complaint that I have would be during check in and breakfast waiter. A little smile does go a long way!",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,Downtown stay,"Great hotel, perfect location close to our branch office, great service, prompt room service and attentive staff.

Food at the restaurant was sub-par and service wasn't great. I am sure that there is better value elsewhere in Casablanca",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,An Excellent choice !!!,"This is an excellent Hotel, in a great location with very good and polite staff.

 November 2016,4,Extremely helpful staff,"The hotel is nice and the staff is spectacular. They went above and beyond to help us find a taxi, buy tickets for the tram (and walked us to the pick up location), and recommend restaurants. -Central location (about 15 minutes taxi from mosque/Ricks) -Good wifi -Amazing staff Cons: The only major con was that it was incredibly noisy the night we stayed. I think they may have been hosting an event on the roof. We were on the 2nd floor and kept up until 1am by drumming. Breakfast is also really expensive.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,Hammam is Amazing-quiet rooms,"Wafaa is an amazing massage therapist. I have been carrying stress in my lower abdomen and she immediately detected it. She has great sense and great way of massaging. Moreover Ghita who performed my exfoliation was so thorough. My skin feels like a baby's bottom. the exfoliation of your body and the steam room are so relaxing and very healthy for the overall skin organ. There may be cheaper places out there but these ladies accommodate you to keep your expense down and give you a very calming, relaxing, health filled experience- On another note Mourad in reception is great! He accommodated me by doing a price match! Concierge help is also really great. By the way it was not noisy at all! Ask for a room on the upper levels -a quiet room and voila -you're taken care of! Enjoy!",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,Great hotel,"We stayed a week at Movenpick hotel Casa and it was a great experience.... +friendly reception staff, good food, good location, super friendly bartender Hassan at bar/Resto 16 -pool was not heathed, concierge was not helpful with picking up my friend from airport. Overall very good and modern hotel compared with other hotels we visited. (Four seasons no alcohol, Hyatt horrible service, Sheraton very old). I will book this hotel again...",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,3,Disappointing,"Good location, but for a 5* Hotel the Movenpick was disappointingly, and surprisingly, noisy. For most of my stay, I did not enjoy a single, uninterrupted night's sleep. Disturbances varied from loud music and inconsiderate guests, to room service and maintenance staff working in the evenings. There just seemed to be constant, and annoying, noise which I found, at times, uncomfortable. The housekeeping staff, although nice & friendly, were too noisy. An example of this were housekeepers and their supervisors shouting down the corridor to each other. I might be knit picking, but this hotel is not cheap. When staying in a 5* hotel you shouldn't need ear plugs! The sound insulation in this hotel is very poor. You should not be able to listen to conversations from the room below! …",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,2,Too noisy...,The hotel is right on the road and its too noisy...breakfast was also ok.

I won't stay here again for sure.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,this is the most friendly hotel,"Just having breakfast before check out but I will be back. I have used other good hotels in Casablanca but this is now the one I will return too. Great atmosphere , rooms good size and the sushi is excellent, go for the hot sushi it was great. The Skybar is excellent , views , space and service But what makes this a great hotel is the people.

It's in a good central location within ten minutes (taxi/tram) of both the main train stations. Check in staff were friendly. The room (a queen double) was a decent size with a small sofa and a large comfy bed. The room was very clean and comfortable. Plus points... nice,clean modern room with an extensive 24hr room service menu. Food was excellent. Gym, although small 24hrs too. Bad points.... any time in the Spa has to be prebooked including sauna/steam and is not free. Breakfast in the restaurant was poor... staff slow to serve and kept disappearing with an average selection of food for a top hotel.

 September 2016,4,Good location and good services,"The hotel is located in the business centre of the city (banking district) and on the cross of main roads and tram line. it is slightly dated in room decoration and all carpets should be replaced or at least properly cleaned. The rooms are of a good size and have all what you need. The breakfast has very reach selection of cold and hot dishes and also good selection of starters, fruit and sweets. There is a very well equipped gym which is not much used, so no problem to choose equipment. The swimming pool on the roof is small but as water was rather cold (late September) not visited but nice to use in the morning and late afternoon to refresh. The towel is provided by spa staff.

 September 2016,3,Pretty average,"We stayed here one night upon arriving in Morocco, before joining our tour. As we subsequently discovered there are many bad hotels in Morocco but for the price we paid for the Movenpick we expected a much higher quality. It is very expensive for what you get. The mini bar is exorbitantly expensive - about $7 AU for a small can of coke or a big bottle of water. The rooftop restaurant menu range is limited (sushi?) and the downstairs restaurant looked terrible. We ended up getting room service which was pretty good. The Red cafe across the road does an excellent breakfast special - thoroughly recommend it. All in all - not recommended. We're currently staying in a Riad in Marrakech which is beautiful and half the price. Perhaps explore the availability of these in…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2016,5,Great Staff! Great Hotel!,"In the heart of Casablanca, the staff of this five start hotel is dedicated to provide excellent services. We stayed from September 20 until October 4, 2016. The breakfast was included in our price. From the door men to Ms. Soukaina at the 16th floor terrace restaurant and pool, from the ladies cleaning the room to the personnel serving breakfast, the team works very hard to make sure you enjoy your stay. For example, at the breakfast where the choice is excellent, you can ask for different things that are not on their buffet. If they have it, they will provide them to you at no extra cost.

 October 2016,4,5 star rooms but poor food and service,"Lovely rooms, almost exceptional. However the food at 00 level was not that great, it was expensive and service was virtually nil. A real shame as this could be a blockbuster place to stay. Breakfasts are good with a selection of everything from local to international foods. Venue is within walking distance to most venues and the tram is right outside. As a five star hotel it was a shame the food and service was not up to scratch, but there are plenty of good quality restaurants close by, so try those. The fact that the restaurant OO was empty should have told us something.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Hotel staff was polite and helpful.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,4,Very nice service,"The hotel is central in Casa. To have a quiet room either take a room in the higher floors and one to the back. Everything is clean, and rooms are large, but not luxurious. The difference comes with the friendliness of the people. That is the part I enjoy the most. For dinner, the Arabic restaurant downstairs is very traditional. But the food is good. Breakfast buffet is fine. The restaurant upstairs has nice views, but not so much charme.

From the moment of check-in, the queues were long and there were only two check-in staff members that were at the front desk. I had to remind the staff member that a security deposit was already taken from my account and was very surprised that he was not aware of this. They ended up taking 2 security deposits from my account as their machines were not working and I am now awaiting for these funds to be cancelled from their end with an email they were due to send me as confirmation that I still have not received.

 September 2016,1,Terrible experience,"Besides the fact that the rooms are very tired to say the least, and do not reflect 5 star qualify, I had 2 very unpleasant experiences at this hotel : 1- At my arrival I went to the rooftop pool straight away, since it was one of the reasons I picked this hotel over the sofitel or fourseasons. At my arrival to the pool I asked the bar tender ""soukaina"" for the menu so that I can order some drinks. She did bring the menu and last minute decided not to serve me because it was ""eid"" and that it was forbidden to serve moroccan guests, I showed my US passport and I assured her that I am not muslim, but she would still refuse to serve me and went on a personal conversation about my faith and my name that sounds ""moroccan"" or ""muslim"" , she was serving other customers which felt very…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2016,2,Quite shabby for the price,"The stay was with family for vacation in Morocco. I would say I was NOT impressed at all on the service. This is just typical hospitality (or lack thereof) you would expect from Moroccan. The room size was small and the room was marginally clean and prepared. Breakfast was very minimal, very long wait time for ordering anything (espresso, omelet, etc) and the taste was very plain, given the general Moroccan cuisine are rich on spice.

At the check-in we got 2 communicating rooms, one of which was a luxury room. Beautiful room, swiss cleanliness. Breakfast was superb; fantastic buffet. All staff was extremely helpful and friendly. On the rooftop, small pool, excelllent late night food service. Sushi and tapas. The hotel has several different cuisine restaurants, one of which is Moroccan. Unless you are a fan of moroccan music and belly-dancing, we advise against. A classic tagine will cost you more than 20 €. Final note. This hotel deserves every one of its 5 stars.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,4,Very Nice Hotel. Food Over Priced.,"This is definitely a nice hotel. We enjoyed everything about it. However, the food is ridiculously over priced. We made the mistake of getting the breakfast in the restaurant. All the tables were dirty. Crumbs on the tables, smudges on the glasses and cups. Not what you expect from a 280 DAR breakfast (about 50$). It was a buffet style breakfast, but they ran out of eggs, so we didn`t get any. we stayed until the end and they never filled up the egg stations again. We had to eat our yogurts with a fork because it was impossible to get service to request a spoon (no spoons on any of the tables). I mean, if we had paid 30 DAR for this, we wouldn't complain, but charging 280 DAR each person, you expect much more. We got much less. Very disapointing. So too bad for us. So we…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2016,3,Nice hotel but poor service,"The rooms are a good standard, the lobby and rooftop terrace are very welcoming. I would have enjoyed my stay if it hadn't been bothered by countless little annoyances such as the daily struggle to get a spoon at breakfast (supply seems short!), getting a wake-up call 2 mornings in a row when I hadn't ordered one, the surprise to realize that you are only offered drinking water in the room on the first day (for some reason), the swimming pool closed because of a private event, etc. It's been ok but next time I would try another place.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,1,Awful hotel,"Awful hotel, from staff to cleanliness, passing by food and amenities. You don't get for the value of your money (rooms are very small, towels are so dirty that they are grey, breakfast is very poor and you still pay 25€ for it...). The wifi is not working well in the rooms, you book a king size bed and you get 2 tiny beds... No early check-in if you arrive early morning and you have to pay a full day charge ... This hotel doesn't deserve more than 2 stars! Some staff members (the receptionist Abdelmadjid and his manager Mourad) are very rude, unprofessional and do not care about customer satisfaction . I will never book ever again in this hotel...",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

So we left the hotel expecting it should be fixed by the time we come back . Later that night it was still the same and I have called the reception 3-4 times and none of these calls got through.

 August 2016,4,nice hotel in center,Stayed here for 4 nights The hotel is well located in the center of the city which means that the attractions are quickly reached with the red taxi. The staff was mostly friendly and helpfull. Be aware that you get a room on the higher levels or on the back side of the hotel because on the street side the noise of the street is loud. For the price paid for the breakfast i should have expect a bit more to me it was a bit basic and every day the same. The service could be better it is a bit disorganised. From the swimmingpool on the roof you should not expect to much it is there you can swim but thats it. The fitness room is good and was during the times that i was there always quiet.

The gym was reasonable with functioning equipment. The location of the hotel is very good and central. We used taxis initially but then discovered the tram and then no more taxis.

He then told us that there was a room available in another hotel not too far from where we were. However, he would not tell us the name or the address of this other hotel; at this point, I asked for the manager. We were told he would be 5 minutes.

They allowed my friends to use the pool after closing time for a quick swim on a very hot day. The food from the grill was great too, authentic Moroccan sausages and meats. I got $20 off by booking direct, but I had to remind the checkin staff as well restaurant staff about the discount (they apply discount towards breakfast). Check in staff also placed a pre-auth on the credit card for 50% more than the room rate.

This is unacceptable as the housecleaning must include washing the floor of the toilette every day. I don't compromise for hygiene. And the second day it was the same which means that housekeeping staff wasn't simply having this duty in their check list. The first day only I found complimentary water, not the second day: another disappointment. The restaurant where I had breakfast was without AC or anyway AC was not properly working.

Second stay the phone labels were missing, so I called reception to ask to be out through to room service. They were annoyed I didn't dial directly and told me to do so next time. Location is not great. And getting taxi from train station is a rip off. Tip: exit station (you'll see ibis in the right) and go directly straight across little car park to tram. Take tram in direction you just walked (away from station, right side entry). Get off at Avenue Hassan II.

Many of the taxi's will tell you that the meter is broken so that they can charge more but I found 40-50 MAD is the standard rate. The hotel is situated in the business part of town so it's far from restaurants. The hotel is also about 15 min taxi ride to the Casablanca Mall which is by the ocean. The hotel has good size rooms with your standard emmeneties. The beds are comfortable and clean. The hotel has a rooftop pool with a bar, a spa as well as a restaurant which is on the pricier side.There is also a small fitness room with treadmills and free weight which is free to use. Be prepared to pay a city tax…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2016,2,Terrible front desk service,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights n the horrible experience started from day 1. The staff named Jalila (or Julila I forgot exactly but I have her photo if you want) has bad attitude towards guests with no smile and unhappy working attitude. Rooms booked through booking.com was said to be not found in the system and she asked us to call booking.com by ourselves. She was holding our passports and asked us to wait. She couldn't solve the problem and asked us to look for a solution and stay somewhere else! What a suggestion, yeah? But it's true. The front desk manager only works until 5:30-6pm, so if you have any problem after that hour, you can only talk to staff like Julila and her colleague Fatima (who is also as unfriendly as her). Internet in several floors is hopeless. They…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 May 2016,3,Good western hotel in a average location,"It was a pleasure to come to a Western hotel after staying only in Riads all over Morocco, but this hotel was a little disappointing. The lobby is rather small and cramped, breakfast was not as good as in the Riads, and there was no view from the room. The bed was comfortable though and the small bathroom was very average.the location a little far from the center and one had to walk around 15-20 min to get to the old Medina.

 May 2016,3,It is not a 5 stars hotel,"The hotel is not so bad but when you choose an ""occidental"" hotel chain as Melia, Hilton, Sheraton, Hyatt, Sofitel or .... Mouvenpick it is because you expect a ""guaranteed quality"" mainly in countries as per on the North Africa where local hotel chains compete in the medium to high end. I have been at Mouvenpick Berlin and here in Morocco and quality is not the same.

 May 2016,3,Don't be fooled by pool picture,"This is not a terrible hotel--it is a centrally located, comparatively reasonably priced hotel with rooms that are average sized and reasonably comfortable if a bit dark. But for a tourist I think there are better options, and I had a couple of annoying problems: 1. The internet had huge problems during my visit (they say they are fixing it and gave me an alternate transmitter for my room). 2. They wouldn't let me into the breakfast buffet wearing a sleeveless shirt, and barred my entry in a very embarrassing public way. this was particularly rich given all the people in track pants and the dirty table sitting there without being cleaned even as clients sought to find someplace to sit down that wasn't dirty.

 May 2016,5,Very good but not a perfect 5.0,Stayed here 6 nights and overall it was very good. Breakfast bar is superb with international and local foods. As lunch/dinner also impressive. Very good wifi and attentive service overall. My disappointment was clogged sink basin and bath that was not fixed after 2 notifications. Also front desk staff were either culturally inept sometimes or rude. Either way they were not s friendly as dining and door staff. This is why I would have preferred a 4.5. I would not avoid this hotel in the future. It's a fine business hotel and convenient. Absolutely great roof garden/bar that perfect for relaxing.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Staff are super-friendly, efficient and helpful. My room was spacious and spotlessly clean, as were the other areas I visited. The 16th floor bar, restaurant, terrace and pool area is fantastic, although the drinks and food are quite expensive. Choice and volume of background music was great. Don't forget that, at breakfast, you can also order omelettes and other items that are not out on display. I found that several taxi-drivers did not seem to know or understand the name of the hotel - my client told me this was because it used to be a Holiday Inn, but that didn't seem to work with the taxi drivers either !

 April 2016,4,Very good hotel,"Good location. Rooms are clean and spacious. Staff are extremely friendly. For those who are looking for a good gym during their stay (with weights), this hotel is not the right pick; however, you will manage. Breakfast was so so but you will expect a better breakfast in such hotels. Wi-Fi is free but annoying as it kept on disconnecting. In brief, this is a recommended hotel and I will consider visiting it again",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Receptionists, concierges, waiters/tresses, are great professionnals and they obviously love their jobs! The hotel is fine though it needs some refurbishement in some areas. Paintts are getting old, curtains also, but it is ok. Lodging costs are fine but any other service is quite expensive, particularly the food and beverages : a coke would cost you 10 times its price in the closer shop... Our group of 5 visitors was charged around 90 Euros for a transfert from the airport which I found somehow expensive...on return we had 2 taxis for 60 Euros!

The registration person noticed this (from his passport) and secretly ordered a birthday cake sent to our room. My son was surprised and, of course, psyched about the cake.

If you are traveling on business it is functional and meets the requirements but with children there may be better facilities available elsewhere. The location is very good, a short walk to the Medina and a tram stop outside.

Once when we arrived and once right before leaving, a total of 3 nights. The first stay upon arrival our room was a bit tight, but overall very clean and comfortable. The second time around the room was much larger and offered the same comfort. The sheets smelled great, the bed was perfect and the bathroom was very clean (which I'm very picky about). The only negative thing I would have to say is that the half glass wall in the shower was poorly designed and the water seeped out from under it onto the bathroom floor. This is very gross and messy to have to deal with every time someone wants to shower. Overall, not bad and will return if I'm in Morocco again.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The same can be said of the staff uniforms - torn, dirty and a mismatch of colours. 3 people on front desk, only one working. Check in took 15 minutes despite having prebooked and paid. As usual, got asked to pay another deposit despite the hotel already holding a sizeable amount. Up to the room through a warren of dirty, old corridors and into an adequately sized area. All amenities are there, they are either of poor quality or tired (bar the TV and bathroom amenities). Example being the kettle which needed a serious decontamination before use.

When you get to your room, you are greeted with some complimentary water. Good start. However, the wifi was abysmal. I was unable to contact my wife or daughter for 2 days because Whatsapp, Skype and FaceTime did not work. I told staff but was not offered any assistance. As I opted not to get my room tidied, I thought I would ask for more water on day 2. The reception said you only get it on the first day.

Please note the wifi problem mentionned by several previous reviewers still exists despite the Manager's feedbacks below. I asked the receptionnist to get some help, he looked at the sheet with a ""process"" to get another wifi with a name with letters and numbers (meaning he never tried the ""Movenpick"" network - implicitly admiting it doesn't work) and seeing it didn't work, he advised me to go to the mezzanine floor ""because it perhaps works better"". Sorry? Is this an answer by a hotel that is full of guests coming for business? I will not come back.

 January 2016,2,Cold customer experience coupled with frequent inaccuracies,"From the lack of soft skills expressed on the part of the front desk team to the billing inaccuracies which were not resolved, the experience was more like ""death by a thousand cuts"" than the relaxing experience that I had expected. This was a personal stay, so there was more time and opportunity to pay attention to the close details that separate an ""okay"" hotel from a ""great"" hotel...it's a stretch for me to even utter that this was an ""okay"" experience!

 February 2016,3,My 1st stay at Movempick Casa,The hotel management should look seriously about the smell in the corridors The rooms are close to the main road - lot of noise Employees all are very helpful and always happy to help - might not consider for next time,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2016,5,Great stay at Movenpick - Mostafa the concierge is the best,"We stayed Feb 13 - 16 2016. Location was central in downtown Casablanca, in walking distance of Old Medina, Place Mohammed, Twin Center Casablanca. Mostafa, the conciege, was brilliant. Super warm, friendly, and helped us book a last minute day trip to Marrakech. He was also incredibly helpful making restaurant reservations everywhere we went!

 February 2016,2,Unsatisfactory,I felt a lot of work is required to train staff further more you cannot find a waste basket in the whole lobby. Needless to mention the breakfast selection was extremely poor & people in the restaurant have no idea about service. They stay one side & keep chatting without servicing their customers.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2016,4,Good visit until check out,"Aside from Internet inaccessible in lobby areas and same breakfast menu daily, hotel stay was quite decent. Prior to check out, I called for my ride to the airport via uber as I normally do (much easier for reimbursements from my company ).car arrived and the disaster began. Taxi drivers parked outside of your hotel decided to illegally interfere with my ride by surrounding the car with later the police to needing to get involved. Uber is legally allowed to operate in morocco but obviously some taxi drivers have an issue with them. Long story short Mövenpick staff refused to get involved on behalf of a guests whose right it is to choose whatever mode of transport chosen to ride to the airport with. Totally unacceptable experience and left me with feelings of displeasure with…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 January 2016,5,Great experience!!!!! I am sure I will go back to this hotel,"This is my 3rd stay at the Movenpick in the last 2 months. The hotel is well situated, the rooms are very descent but the best of all is the service from everybody. Something rare and special to this hotel is the availability and the care showed by the General Manager and his team. I requested to meet Mr Amr Kallini, the General Manager to express some personal wishes. It was amazing to see him offering a meeting right away, where he took the time to listen and immediately responded favourably to my request. The other point that I should mention is the competency and the excellent service offered by Mrs Habiba Alaoui, the Room Service's manager and her team whenever I had to interact with them.

 December 2015,4,Satisfied,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and was pleased with my stay. The overall appearance of the room is comfortable but not luxury with decent WiFi and spacious rooms. The location is average, it is about 8 to 12 Moroccan Diram using a red taxi to Maarif district that has Zara, Etam, Burger King and great patisserie such as Amoud etc. The stuff are helpful and friendly.

 December 2015,5,"Great rooftop pool, excellent tasteful rooms, great views","Check In/Check Out Check in was very fast. Even though I didn’t do any online check in, I didn’t have to fill in a form (unlike Mercure). All I had to do was sign a print out with my details. I was also upgraded from the standard room to a deluxe room, which was on floor 12, and featured a larger sitting area. Check out was a bit slower, even though there were two receptionists handling it. A couple in front of me decided to chat about their travels, while another person was making queries about hotels around the Movenpick and hotel rates. Normally, this wouldn’t bother me, but as I was trying to make the train, I wasn’t too happy about this.

 December 2015,4,Rooms ok but lack of English speaking staff an issue.,Original room was very poor when we arrived. We complained and God a slightly better one.

The hotel was centrally located and accessible via taxis and even tram service.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,2,In need of serious upgrade,"We arrived at this hotel very late and exhausted. The reception staff was nice and friendly, but the rooms were miserable! The view was literally blocked by an office building - so much for the panoramic view! We kept the curtains and blinds closed all the time. The bathtub is clogged. The mould is everywhere in the wet areas. The carpet in the room ( and in all corridors) is dirty and old , and needs serious cleaning or replacement. Towels look like they have been used for ages, there softness and colour faded. We slept like dead log, and checked out as soon as we woke up. Never coming back to this place again.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Some rooms can be noisy because of the road in front of hotel. I recommend to book room in upper floors.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,2,Bad Experience !,"I have stayed at this hotel several times, and I can safely say that this hotel does not live up to the Moevenpick hotels standard. First off, I arrive at 1:30 PM and I was told that my room is not ready, as the check-in time is at 2 PM !! I ask to be put into any other room, I get the response of we are fully booked ! After much debate and willing to pay more, I was put in a room on the second floor........Turns out trying to sleep in that room was almost impossible since the windows are very thin and you can practically hear everything going on outside, I had to eventually sleep with my noise-cancelling headsets !! On a different note, the hotel has a weird policy of only putting complimentary water once during your entire stay !

 November 2015,4,Very nice hotel and value for money,This is a very nice hotel. Good location too. Nice views of the city from the pool bar located on 16th floor ---fantastic. My only complaint is the size of the restaurant. Rather small for such a busy hotel.,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2015,1,Terrible,"My first stay at the hotel was great. I booked a second time but could not go because of a change in the schedule of my project, and they charged my credit card. Thats fine, as it was a non cancellable booking. I have been chasing them since August to simply send me a receipt/invoice for the charge so that I can regularise it with my company, but there has been no response! When I call they say we will look into it, but no status ever! It takes 5 months to give an invoice for money you have already charged?! And this after my company uses this hotel several times a month! Terrible!",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Once in the room, it was spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the bathtub was huge! We ordered a corkscrew and gentleman who brought it to us came back a second time on his own accord to bring us wine glasses and a plate of chips and olives. Another man was even able to run to the pharmacy for me and retrieve feminine products. Bless him! Will definitely stay here again if we are in Casablanca.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2015,4,Great Base in Casablanca,"Stayed here in November 2015 for 3 nights and apart from the hotel car not turning up at the airport to collect me and then the front desk seeming to block my credit card more than once, had a very pleasant stay. They upgraded my room to apologise for the car issue but it was at the very front of the hotel so the noise from the busy traffic junction was very loud from 6.30am until around 8pm. Hotel room was spacious and the pool bar and Spa facilities were excellent and good value for money. Despite the initial issues, the Movenpick represents a good hotel in a central location and it doesn't break the bank.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

I really like to have three options for meal services, the bar downstairs quiet and very private, the roof restaurant with very good sushi, and the lunch room at the reception level very good and clean but a bit too busy some times.

 November 2015,5,Absolutely lovely!,"Stayed at this hotel for a week. Faultless. My room was spacious, clean and sunny. Excellent quality bathroom amenities with argan oil. Maid service was superb, clean spotless room throughout the stay. Food was tasty and fresh, I basically ate mostly moroccan dishes but there is enough variety for others who want mainstream, for me if I am in a foreign country I eat the local cuisine so finding a hotel that answers to this is always refreshing. Otherwise whats the point! It was too cold to enjoy the 16eme bar on the roof though the view is worth it any type of weather. A must is Bar Seven, with its cozy arabian nights ambiance, for a end of day cocktail. The cocktails need improving though and there was no sushi and I had to have tapas instead. The staff at reception was very…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2015,3,Good but some shortcomings,"It's generally a good hotel, combining a good location, big rooms, nice swimming pool on 16th Floor with an excellent panorama of the city. However, during my stay there the first week of November 2015, there were some shortcomings which actually spoiled the impression. The hotel has problems with Wi-Fi on certain floors, thus in my room on 12th Floor there was none. The visit of the ICT specialist did not solve the problem, so I had to move to another room, on a different Floor. One of my colleagues experienced the same problem. Very regretful experience for a 5-Star hotel as it positions itself. Further, they started some maintenance or cleaning works in the main Cafe without notifying guests and with no Notice of Staff at its entrance. So, guests coming to the Cafe for…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2015,4,Great hotel in not so great location,"This is a city hotel next to a very noisy intersection of two main traffic arteries of Casablanca. I was on the 14th floor and the noise was still a nuisance when I had to work in my room. I suspect one of the window frames was skewed letting the noise in.

 October 2015,4,Good choice if you want to stay in the new part of the city,"I stayed here overnight en route from Marrakech for a morning flight back to the USA. I stayed long enough to have room service, shower, and sleep before getting up at 6 AM for transport to the airport. Check in was a mixed bag for me. The staff wasn't very friendly. Admittedly, I didn't look my best having just come off a 5 hour train ride where comfort was more important than style, so my chosen travel attire of a t-shirt, cargo shorts and flip flops probably was the cause for the reception desk's attitude. However, they did quickly find my reservation, complete the check out process, and help me bring my bags to my room. So at worst, this is a minor quibble.

 April 2015,1,"Be careful, very dangerous hotel!","Be very careful if you choose this hotel, the staff will steal and the hotel management will cover it up. Police would just get paid off and no one will do a thing about it. Even their central office in Europe will do nothing about it. Very intimidating and scary situation.

 October 2015,3,Not a 5 Star Hotel,"On the positive side - friendly staff - very good breakfast buffet - nice (but small) roof top pool + chill out area On the negative side - although staff is generally motivated, they often seemed not well trained. Examples: the concierge told us the guided tour at Hassan II mosque starts at 2pm but it was actually 3pm. One morning at 8:30am a maid just came into our room without knocking while we were still in bed. - bad windows, hence some street noise - hotel generally seems a bit run down. As far as I know, Moevenpick just recently took over the property.

First of all, it's not a 5-star hotel, not even a 4-star, according to the value of customer service, accommodation in general and design, as it doesn't reflect the qualities of a 5 or 4 star hotel. During our three nights stay we had more than a few unpleasant incidents with the staff. The housekeeping staff managed to enter our room without knocking for more than three times, they entered even when there was a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door, they entered with same sign on again the next day after we had spoken with the management about this issue.

 June 2015,4,"Not really a 5 stars, but good anyway!","Lobby is too small for this kind of hotels receiving many groups. In addition they have a big table with flowers, that looks nice, but it takes plenty of space from the entrance. Rooms are confortable and tidy, but some details need more maintenance. Breakfast price and restaurant service are overpriced for being Morocco and being nothing special. Service is very good. They are customer minded and helpful. Enjoy terrace around the swimming pool in 16 floor. View is great. Unfortunately you can't see the sunset, but sunset ambience there is great! Hotel is place in a quite centric place, to go by walk to the old medina, twin center, etc. But this square is very noisy because of the traffic and despite you are in a upper floor and windows are not too bad, the noise from 7am is…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The hotel is located in a busy intersection but not as chaotic or noisy as the area surrounding the medina. Casablanca is a wonderful city that can be well explored from this base. The hotel amenities are above standards with large and comfortable rooms. The breakfast and room service are expensive but it offers good food quality. The staff is attentive and helpful.

 May 2015,4,Comfortable hotel,"We spent 1 night here before flying home. The reception staff were very friendly, helpful & spoke good english. Our room was spacious, clean & comfortable. We were on the 11th floor facing the street but didnt find it noisy. We enjoyed the pool on the roof but didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment on breakfast, although it was expensive. The hotel is in a good location, if you follow the street with the tram it takes you down towards the port & city centre, along with the medina. After spending time travelling around Morocco we didnt like Casablanca & would recommend only spending a night there before flying out. Having said that though im sure it has its hidden treasures we just didnt have time to explore.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 May 2015,1,Abysmal,"You would think that you pay for what you get. Not for the Moevenpick Casablanca. I usually stay at the Sheraton Towers Hotel Casablanca but it was fully booked in this particular week I was in town. So, for the difference in price, where the Moevenpick is almost double the Sheraton's rate, I was very disappointed. The staff were not friendly, customer service was at its lowest, my guests were insulted, breakfast was poor - food quality was below average for the rates they charge. I had to live from my luggage for one week because the cupboard only had room for my suits and shirts! You'd think at the rate you're paying that they would have double glazed windows to cut down the noise from the traffic & the neighboring streets.

The rooms were very clean, spacious and well air conditioned! I think the cleaning lady was coming 2-3 times a day! The breakfast had a wide range and also some local choices. The pool was clean ,great view, and with space to sit, although it was a bit small. The location is good enough, the area safe.. it is a bit loud outside from the streets, and you can hear it in the room- but this is Casablanca! There is free WiFi but is keeps logging off.. In general I would go back again, thinking of the services and good price.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The check in was quick but the lights in our room did not work so we were upgraded to a bigger room which was nice. Pros about our stay: Room was spacious for all three of us. Very modern design with clean lines. Breakfast buffett was good but needs a bit more variety. Cigar lounge was great as was the Casablanca Cafe. They brought in chefs from the Movenpick Phuket for Thai Fest and we were served the best Thai food we have ever have. Service staff is fantastic.

Great little corner shop just across from the trams, just make sure you have money for your fair as this little shop is tormented with people looking for change. Great little ice-cream place as you turn the corner from the hotel just two minutes down the street that opens very late. My only negative would be from the traffic noise outside.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2015,4,Good hotel,"Good, pleasant hotel in Casablanca. After travelling the country for a while, I must say I found it quite comforting to arrive in this modern environment (meaning both Casablanca and the hotel). The hotel is more of a business hotel, but we still managed to create quality vacation time for ourselves at the side of the rooftop pool where they would serve you your highball and beer at the right temperature or something that comes close to it (during our trip we had experienced that in Morocco alcoholic drinks - if available - are almost always served way too warm). It probably was also the one hotel in Morocco that we had booked which came closest to the standard that it promised (which is nothing extraordinary, but it lived up to the expectations that you can reasonably have in a…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Soon came along the manager on duty, I believe his name is Mr Omar who kindly upgraded us to a junior suite room. The room was quieter and well laid out with all one needs for a comfortable stay. We did not eat at the hotel as we wanted to experience local food from local spots but had a peek at the menu and food lay out which looked tasty and delicious though for our Western palate. If you have an adventurous stomach like us, you may want to skip this as there were nice local spots around the area.

On the rooftop,there is a server to take your order if you want to order food or drinks. The room was a good size. We had wi-fi that worked in the room, but stopped for a about two days.It was clean and spacious. It also had a great view of the city.

 May 2015,5,Fantastic end to a Holiday,"My friend and I treated ourselves to a luxury stay on the last night of our epic 2 1/2 week tour of Morocco by staying at the Movenpick Casablanca - and we were treated like VIPS. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly (going out of their way to ensure that there was an English speaking person available to help with any queries...and booking of airport transfers). The food was DELICIOUS and well worth the money we spent The hotel is easily accessible from Casa Voyageurs Rail Station, with the Hassan II tram station right outside It was a fantastic way to end our trip!",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The food at the hotel was expensive but good. The breakfast was excellent. The business centre needs to be improved. I could not print an important letter. The shower is not fantastic.

After staying in riads for the rest of the trip, this hotel felt quite luxurious. The bed was huge, and the room very comfortable with all the facilities you'd expect from this type of hotel. We had great views from our 11th floor room, and didn't have any problems with noise (although the hotel is next to a very busy road junction). The hotel is in a decent location, with a tram stop next door. This was really useful for getting around the city, and to Casa Voyageurs station. There is not a lot around the hotel itself, but the city centre is a 15 minute walk or 2 stops on the tram.

Rented meeting room was not ready. Internets speed still way below acceptable despites all management promises (even on this website comments). Continuously being chased by hotel staff to sign for already paid bills. Shower flooded bathroom every time. And checkout again was a total disaster requiring 4 attempts before finally the correct bill was printed. This might have been a grand hotel ages ago but now it is by most a 3 star.

We were on the 12th floor, and the room was quiet with no intrusion from the noise of the street. The decor was attractive and the room had plenty of space with a large walk in wardrobe. Very good bed, and we slept well. The breakfast selection was very nice, and we particularly appreciated the chance to sample Moroccan specialities.

Mr Omar was a most gracious host, extremely apologetic about the circumstances, and went above and beyond in ensuring our stay was the most pleasant possible despite the situation. As part of his apology, we were treated to a complimentary meal at the Moevenpick's restaurant buffet. It was outstanding, and as expected, the service by the wait staff was divine.

Anyway, I was told that I couldn't stay there the night and that I needed to sit down in the lobby to wait for the manager. I went to the toilet and on my return.

I asked to have a room on the quiet side but, surprise, they were making renovation work on Saturday morning at 9! The noise was unbearable and it was impossible to stay in the room, let alone to sleep. I called the reception but they told me it was normal and proposed me to change rooms, without any apologies...

The lighting in the room is terrible, especially in the bathroom. This made shaving pretty difficult as I was unable to see much of my facial hair due to the dim lighting.

Even if the room was elegant and spacious, I have been given a very, very noisy room, just on the big avenue. All day and night long with traffic noise, horns, sirens,… Sincerely, I wouldn’t have expect it from a 5 star Swiss owned hotel, especially when you look for some relax and peace after a long day of meetings.

There was a large complimentary bottle of mineral water. The bathroom was roomy enough with the shower over a bath and a half screen - very European - luckily not too much water spillage over the side.

The room was clean and modern and the bathroom was excellent. Modern stand up shower and modern bathtub. There was also a separate partially private toilet area. The bed was comfortable. Most importantly, the staff was very friendly. French is the main language but there is enough English spoken so you can manage with some basic French mixed into your English. I would recommend.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2015,5,Excellent service for organizing an ad hoc wedding night,"Can you imagine an ad hoc wedding evening away from home with no dinner or any party arranged? Sounds like a fiasco, but not with the Mövenpick Casablanca staff. We got married on the 31st of December in the morning and were supposed to fly to Marrakech the same day. However, our flight was cancelled and our witnesses and us got stuck in Casablanca and happened to stay in this hotel. As the night manager spotted my bridal bouquet, upon arrival, gave us immediately an upgrade to a suite with welcome sweets and free massage in the spa which I really considered a nice gesture. Furthermore, even though we got to the hotel late and did not make it to the restaurant before 11 on New Year's Evening...., we still wanted to give it a try and have a nice dinner and evening.

We booked the family room on Expedia and expedia screwed it up. The staff was very helpful and I find no fault in the service they provided. Rooms were nice sized and well equipped. We were only 10 minutes from the main train station, 10 minutes from the mosque and 35 minutes to the airport.

 November 2014,4,Noce stay,Thats my first visit to casablanca. Lovely city and country The hotel by itself was located at the heart of the city. Its a business hotel. So don't expect a 5 stars lobby and many restaurants. The room was nicely fitted and clean. I choses 8th floor to be away of street crowd The restaurant is nice. I have tried it couple if times and food was good with plenty of hospitality Concierge tried to help in several instance. But they lack of professional Though they are extremely friendly as most moroccan people,Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2014,4,.wow...but..,"This hotel seems to have it all, It has a great pool on the roof, a huge breakfast and nice rooms for a good price. However service (not from everyone though - the concierge was amazing) is very, very slow (as most of Casablanca it seems). Internet proved to be a big challenge here. It depends on what room you get. My room was in a bit of a corner and the concrete walls might have obscured the signal, but being on a business trip not having decent internet was a big problem. The restaurant is VERY pricey and service is abysmal. Food is so-so all over but is nicely presented. One very good meal was the classic tajine, but you can get this for about the third of the price at any good restaurant in town and at the same quality.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

However when we went to book out we were shocked to find out that the average breakfast was £25 extra although this was never mentioned on booking in. They showed the very small print on pre booking in. My point is they should make it clear at reception. We did offer to pay half but they refussed. The fact also is we spent a fortune on the very exspensive drinks in the hotel bar. Very poor service and attitude.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The rooms are awesome,they have everything you need in them, iron included, nice beds, i do thinks there is something thermic in them. I had a wonderful night of sleep here. Smells good and looks good! The rooftop is also one of the best i've seen, with gym, pool, spa, and a nice view over the large city of casablanca. Definitely the best breakfast I ate, it has everything you can imagine!! International and moroccan food! It's difficult to look for negative points here, however i could sugest more electricity points to link chargers, ours only had 2 free, and neither of them mear the bed.

 August 2014,4,Great hotel,"Aside from the staff, who seemed very confused by our group (they couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that several couples travelling together had different last names), and who actually tried to check me into a room that was already taken by someone else, this hotel was very nice. I loved my room (as a result of the confusion, I got somewhat upgraded to a smallish suite with a king bed and a sitting area), and it was a shame my group only stayed for one night. I would have preferred one night in Fes and two nights in Casablanca. Very well located near the tramway, but quite a walk to the medina (at least 500m, I'd say). I found the hotel itself quiet but it is on a main street, and traffic in Morocco is definitely not for the faint of heart, so expect lots of road noise.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2014,1,Needs improvement ! Lackluster hotel and staff,"I guess smoking is a Casablanca thing because the hotel smelt like smoke, the entrance, the corridors, just about everywhere you went people were smoking. The water fountain outside the hotel doesn't work. What kind of 5 star hotel can't even keep up the appearance of their hotel. The hotel couldn't find our booking even though I had proof of booking from booking.com, so check in was a nightmare. We did eventually check in about an hour after arrival. The area in which the hotel is located looks fairly ok but we didn't venture out as it was almost 9 pm when we were eventually checked in. The hotel rooms are a decent size. Very modern and well decorated, although a bit on the dark side. The restaurant is very nice and they serve tasty food. There was a delightful gentleman Amid…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2014,3,Strange Hotel,"What a weird place. There's nothing awful about this place but there's also nothing great about it either. The rooms are also strangely cold. Black paint, thick curtains. Not very welcoming. Even the rooftop seems haphazardly decorated. Lounge chairs are crammed up against one another. While there are several food options, the prices are through the roof for what you get. Staff seems nice enough but also inexperienced. Located in a neighborhood with not much character and very few restaurants. Some of these things could be chalked up to the fact that the hotel has undergone new management and could improve in the future.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The hotel is expensive regarding the structural conditions of the building, especially in what concerns the acoustic comfort. The staff is very the staff is very nice but they have a lot of difficult to handle with the management rules and internal procedures. The reservations and invoicing system of the hotel is often with problems and it's normal to have clients complaining in the reception.

 June 2014,1,A mediocre hotel with inexistant customer service,"First of all, I've stayed in Movenpicks all over the Middle East and they've been sensational, especially the one in Petra. That said, the Movenpick in Casablanca is a joke. First of all, they refused to move my reservation when I reserved under the wrong date so I lost my payment of one full night, when all they had to do was change it to the following day. After I arrived, it took them a full hour to check me in. The man at the front desk was nice but absolutely clueless. When I asked if the hotel could offer me a complimentary drink due to the wait, he told me there was water in my room even though I didn't yet have a room.

It's a well meaning hotel with good intentions but fails to deliver at evey corner... but it is amusing! This hotel could be an excellant hotel, but somehow the Movenpick ethos ""Ordinary things in an Extraordinary way. Attention to detail..."" seems to have been badly translatted here or simply not to have actually been communicated to the local management team! I am sure if you are allocated a room to your liking (the rooms are an exccalnet size, with good amenaties.. but be aware, they are all diiferent layouts, and if you want a view, ask for a room on a high floor preferably above floor 12) and you don't hit any problems, then you will enjoy staying at Movenpick Casablanca.

 December 2013,3,"Good location, unhelpful staff, weird shower heads","Full disclosure: my first impression of the Husa hotel was marred by the fact that our suitcases got lost (my first time) and we had a stressful time getting to Morocco (our flight reservation from Brussels to Casablanca got mysteriously canceled and we managed to get on the plane to Casablanca in the last minute, after having almost accepted that we weren't going to make it). With this preface in mind, the Husa is very conveniently located just off of one of the tram stops. After you get off the airport train at Casa Voyageurs, you take the city tram for a few stops, and the hotel is right off of one of the tram stops.

Although they knew there were 3 of us in one room, we got up to our room and there was no cot for our daughter and towels for 2 people only. They advertise a sushi bar/restaurant, it was closed. The only restaurant open was the international cafe. The 3 of us ordered beef tenderloin medium rare. All 3 came well done. We sent them back. They came back almost raw.

From the moment we approached the front desk until the moment we left for the airport, we could not have received better service. When we were checking in, we asked for an extra quiet room as we were tired from the long bus trip and we wanted to get up relatively early to check out the mosque first thing the next morning.

Hotel room is decently sized and clean. My main complaint is that they tried to charge an extra $75 USD for a guest when I mistakenly booked a 1 person room (even though this was a king bed room, and extremely spacious). All rooms in the US are double occupancy, so I admit that there may be local customs I am not aware of. When I challenged them on this matter, they initially tried to extract an extra $75, which would have made this a $200/night room, which it is not of that caliber. Ultimately they came down to an extra $25.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Unless you're used to traffic noise, re-consider for staying here. It can be really noisy around 6-7 pm. Room size is okay, felt less spacious because it has a sofa in it, but eventually I liked having the sofa. Cleanliness was a bit of a problem, perhaps in 1 or 2 days I found my room wasn't really tidied up (only the bed was made), and cleaning service missed a big spot in the bathroom.

I suggested to the manager that a room that reeks of cigarette smoke is not actually a non-smoking room, but he didn't understand.

 May 2012,4,Good luxury hotel,"I stayed here one night due to the hotel that I actually booked was overbooked. So they arranged a room here. I didn´t see that much from the hotel. I arrived late and left early morning. Seems typical 5 star business hotel. Designed to keep people comfortable western style. It could be in any city in the world. As long as you stay in the hotel you might totally forget where you are. The style is dark. Long dark hallways. Decent sized quiet typical 5 star rooms. With lots of bedding, options and luxury bathroom. Typical hotel food and hotel-food prices but of good quality. Breakfast also typical for the class of hotel. They do have some local options like for example local mint-tea. Location is in midst of down town. Easy to find a taxi.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2013,1,Depressing,"After a trip to Marrakech, I went to this hotel in casablanca. What a disappointment!! Impossible to sleep after 7AM because the hotel is near a roundabout and drivers do not stop honking the horn. Windows have are not doubled. In addition I rarely saw the staff smiling. Never again I will go to casablanca for tor tourism nor for work. Burk :(",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2013,4,A very nice hotel in downtown Casablanca,"Nice modern rooms. The hotel has also a very friendly staff. Modern bathrooms. The beds are somewhat hard if you're used to high-comfort matrasses. Great view on top terrace, with a refreshing swimming pool.

 January 2013,3,Not a 5 star hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights and because our departure time was very early in the morning, we booked two different reservation (one night with breakfast and the other nitht without breakfast). The reception did not understand well the reservation and they tried to give us two rooms for mywife and myself!? and even after we explained, gave us two different room type for each day as the rate was different. After explaining many times that the room should be the same and difference is only breakfast, they understood. We booked a king-size bedroom and we asked for it to make sure at the time of check-in but when we walked in to the room, the room had two signe beds, and we needed to go back to the reception to change the room. The English level and quality at the reception…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2012,4,Served its purpose,"This was a very adequate hotel, clean and in a good location. We arrived fairly late at night and left early the following morning, so we cannot comment on all of its facilities. The bedroom had a good view over part of the city. It would have benefited, however, with more power points for our electronic equipment.",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2012,1,Never again,"We had an unpleasant experience in this hotel, which is currently called ""Husa Casablanca Plaza"" and managed by the Husa Group. Actually the bad feeling already started when booking through their own group website booking system. I made a mistake with the booking dates and tried hard to get in touch with them several times via emails and phone calls which they never replied, chasing them for days. The double room we booked through their website cost Euro 118.-- (including taxes). When we checked-out and had to pay the bill, the receptionist asked us to pay 132 Euro! We showed him our reservation but he justified that with the exchange rate difference (which is not specified anywhere in their website nor in the reservation page). We had a terrible argument and left frustrated…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2012,3,Good for business travelers but not a 5 star,"Couple late 30's, stayed for 1 night We stayed there before taking the plane back to london. arrived from the train station - 50 dir, tourist price for any taxi drive in the city without the meter... The hotel is modern, very clean, centrally located, 5/10 min to the mosque, 20 dir with the meter. rooms are really nice, ample space, good beds and very modern with all the usual items. however we were a bit disappointed because - the outside pool is actually not heated - sauna is not included in the price (gym is) - spanish restaurant was not opened - you can smoke in the main restaurant area (european food was fine btw) - they made us pay at check out before realising we had already done so when we booked otherwise, the mosque tour is one hour (120 dir) and well worth it The…",Movenpick_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
