 November 2022,5,Luxury in Casablanca,"This hotel is a beautifully restored Art Deco building, with stylish interiors. The staff are charming and very helpful. Our room was elegant, comfortable and spacious. The rooftop restaurant was clearly ‘the place to be’ in the evening. Our meal was wonderful - lobster rice highly recommended! The breakfast on the roof was absolutely delicious. This hotel truly lives up to its Relais et Chateaux status. The location is very good - no more than 30 mins walking distance from many of the places to see including the Hassan Il Mosque.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2022,4,Art Deco Gem with a Fabulous Rooftop,"This hotel is tucked away on a tiny, hard-to-find street. Originally built as a private residence, it is a beautiful and historic Art Deco building, with large rooms and large bathrooms. Our check-in was a bit less than stellar, and that might be because they are understaffed, but there were no major hassles. That said, there was no warm welcome, either. Our room was beautiful, and the bathroom so big you could have a party in it. Housekeeping was top-notch, as was the bell staff. The highlight of our short stay was dinner at the rooftop restaurant. The waitstaff were attentive and professional. Cocktails were perfect and the food was totally first rate! We had actually stayed at the Four Seasons Casablanca on the first leg of our journey, and I wish we had stayed here instead…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2022,5,Fantastic,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel with top rate service and and insanely comfortable bed. Breakfast on the rooftop was well worth the price and delicious, and we also enjoyed tapas for dinner. We would especially recommend the Andalusian octopus. Finally, although we usually like to explore alone, the front desk arranged a guide and driver for us and it was an incredible experience.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2022,5,It’s ranked #1 for a reason,"What a great hotel. Tucked away on a quiet side street. Helpful staff. Large pretty, well appointed clean rooms with large bathrooms. Comfy beds (which we found was a rarity on this trip). The softest most comfy slippers I’ve ever felt. And the rooftop restaurant food is fantastic - especially at dinner. One of the best meals I had. My only nitpicks are the beds are too close together especially for such a big room and the draping around the bed is just a dust catcher and unnecessary. Also they should stop putting decorative velvet pillows (which r not cleaned) on the bed touching the bed pillows where guests will be putting their faces. Nothing should be on a hotel bed that hasn’t been washed. I did have one issue at lunch where a server brought me the wrong dish (I assume…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2022,5,A meal to remember,"We had a superb meal in this out-of-the-way hotel in Casablanca. Service was first rate, the food excellently prepared and the cocktails heavenly! Being compact the atmosphere was intimate but by no means cramped and the decor was delightful. Having the roof open added to the special feel of the top floor setting. Highly recommended!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2022,5,Excellent dinner at Hotel LeDoge,We stayed one night at Hotel LeDoge and had dinner in the restaurant. We tried many Tapas so we could taste more foods.

The best staff by far of anywhere we have been before. The hotel is a delight of old style opulence and with the amazing staff, it really was a pleasure staying there. We had the 'standard' room and were more than happy - the maid visited every day and left complimentary bottled water, fruit and nuts. On arrival we had a complimentary bottle of wine too. We read some other traveller reviews that said this wasnt as good as others in the chain - well those other hotels must be beyond amazing! We were not disappointed with Hotel le Doge and would definitely return. To add to the hotel and improve guest satisfaction, it would be great to have a local map (for walking) and maybe a…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2022,5,Beutiful Hotel and Rooftop Restaurant,We stayed in Casablanca doing one of the legs of our trip to Morocco and had the opportunity to stay at the Le Doge Hotel & Spa. The hotel is well located near some areas of interest. We actually walked from the hotel to the Grand Mosque and back one day. The walk provided the opportunity to get to know the city and see different districts of the city. It was an experience. The hotel has this nice stair case that you see in many of of the pictures too. We also had some drinks on the rooftop deck and had breakfast included with our stay and it was yummy. The hotel is also part of the Relais et Chateaux.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2022,2,"Disappointing, not a typical R&C level!","Booked this hotel to have an interesting art deco boutique hotel experience, after having stayed at Riad Fes and the Four Seasons in Marrakech. Small property in a neighborhood that is hard to find. Front desk service not particularly helpful, made me show proof of free breakfast in our rate three times. Rooms are a bit tired and in need of updates. Midnight brought the sound of neighborhood dogs barking and motorcycles outside, heard through closed 3rd floor windows. The scent of cigarette smoke permeated the hallway air, wafting downwards from the 5th floor terrace where there’s a small bar/resto. By the way, no hot water in shower despite waiting 10”. Skip this one and stay elsewhere if you’re expecting a typical luxury boutique hotel experience. Not a true 5 star…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2022,4,Great staff,"Very nice, boutique hotel in a quiet residential area. My favorite was Great staff: Reception, bellman, staff on rooftop restaurant. Everyone was really wonderful.

It may be good to consider.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2022,5,Wonderful first stop.,We were only here for one night. We ate dinner which had amazing flavors on the roof and it was beautiful.

 June 2022,5,Stylish Retro Hotel With Modern Cuisine,"This is an excellent, stylish boutique hotel, especially if you like Art Deco and fusion cuisine. I liked the big splashy rooms and lavish baths, the rooftops terrace, the professional staff and the delicious cuisine. The breakfast on the rooftop was outstanding. My only quibbles were that the hot water was lukewarm and electrical outlets were few. The hotel is well located in a quiet one way street near the Cathedral and the foundation Slaoui Museum. Be forewarned that the street on which the hotel is located is extremely narrow and very hard to find. I would stay again at this hotel.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2022,5,Boutique Art Deco Hotel a great choice in Downtown Casablanca,"My wife and I stayed at the Le Doge Hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of our Morocco vacation, and 1 night on the way out.

 October 2021,5,An oasis in the busy Casablanca.,"We had a lovely two night stay at this beautiful small hotel. So many highlights, the building itself, once a family home and now turned into this one of a kind hotel. The gorgeous mirrored staircase all the way up to the rooftop restaurant on floor 5. The rooms all named after stars and decorated in that style. I stayed in Coco Chanel a beautiful room. So much care has gone in to the decorations, all very instagram worthy. I want to highlight the small treats given in the room. For the first time, all things so good and not only sugar, but nuts, oranges, special cookies. The staff was very nice, positive and attentive.

In fact, we had book a different hotel in Casablanca for our final night but, after our earlier experiences, it was an easy decision to cancel it and spend that night at Le Doge. We stayed in both of their ground floor suites - both completely different, both stunningly presented. These rooms have a terrace which was a nice private spot to read or enjoy a glass of wine. We also ate dinner at the rooftop restaurant on both stays. The chef is Spanish and the food has an interesting north African-European fusion…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2021,5,Beautiful Hotel & Fantastic Food!,"I stayed at Hotel Le Doge for one night. My room was beautiful, but the highlights were definitely the restaurant and the bed! The bedding they had was probably THE most comfortable bedding I have ever slept in (and I have stayed in many hotels all around the world!). I love down bedding and I like to just melt into my bed, and this is exactly what this bed was like! I enjoyed lunch on their rooftop when I arrived. They have a beautiful small open air rooftop restaurant/lounge. I unfortunately sprained my ankle that afternoon, so I ended up staying in and having dinner up there too. I am certainly glad that I did, because it was fantastic! Everybody in the hotel was friendly and helpful!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 July 2020,5,"Wonderful, and will definitely stay here again!","I thoroughly enjoyed my one night at the Le Doge, and will make a point of going back. I was only in Casa in transit for the night, and so it was a little further than I would normally go for such a short stay. The hotel arranged my airport transfers perfectly, and making the arrangements with the Executive Manager was quick and easy. The beautiful art deco room, with the most comfortable bed and pillow, were just what I needed. Not the mention the absolutely delicious dinner (I had Lebanese) and breakfast at the beautiful rooftop restaurant and bar! I liked that the small sized bar / restaurant was a bit busy with locals and not only guests early in the evening. It is well worth a stay.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

From the elegant greeting on arriving, to the quick tour of the beautiful property, to the very comfortable room (with patio), to the delicious food, this property knows how to work its' charm. The factor that even outweighs all the wonderful attributes above, is the staff who knows how hospitality works and prove it in every encounter.

We stayed one night in the Coco Chanel room! The breakfasts and dinners were delicious and so graciously presented and served.

 December 2019,5,Pleasant experience,"I had a wonderful stay in this elegant boutique hotel. The singular & original thing about this hotel is that each room has a specific theme.

 December 2019,3,Nice hotel and location but over rated,"This is a very nice hotel on a very quiet street close to the main square. However, in my opinion the hotel is over rated. The service is ok although in my case it was severely lacking. I requested a wake up call early morning to catch a flight. I confirmed the wake up call before I went to bed. In the morning - no wake up call. This is absolutely unacceptable at any hotel, let alone a five star hotel. When I asked the front desk what happened, they looked at me with glassy eyes. A quick, I'm sorry, and that was it. In addition, the balcony door did not lock, the design of the shower made taking a shower a bit of a challenge and they charge you for coffee in your room while the few soft drinks in the mini bar are free. Quite unusual. I would choose another hotel if I…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The staff were super helpful, arranging a tour and giving tips on how to deal with local taxis.

Rooms are named and themed after some of the era's historic personalities, some familiar, others less so. We drew the Josephine Baker room, decked out in purple upholstery and stylish French furnishings, with brightly colored posters of the famous dancer on the walls. The bed was plush, but drawbacks included the exceptionally dim lighting (a problem for early morning packing) and a slightly cramped bathroom.

My flight came in 3 hours late and Hafidi coordinated getting a driver to the airport to pick me up, since I had gotten in late and suddenly my plans to grab a dinner and check out the city were upturned. Hafidi immediately had recommendations, got me fed, set up a private driver to take me to the mosque and several sites the following day to ensure I got to experience Casablanca before having to leave for the airport.

Very attractive, food good with a decent Moroccan red wine. Location on a tiny back street is a bit out of the way and we saw no taxi stand nearby. But staff will call taxi. Coming back three times,no driver knew the hotel so be sure you have a map to show location. Even then you have to show driver exactly where to turn onto Hotel’s street. We had Fitzgerald room and 1st night multiple dogs barked loudly all night, making sleep difficult. 2nd night better. I know it’s trendy,but I find the heavy duvet irritating. We could only get A/C down to 72 degrees and with duvet on it was too hot, off too cold. Breakfast was extra, and a bit pricey for what we had.

They brought us delicious cookies and mint tea in our rooms since we were tired and ready to relax. They arranged a taxi to the airport for us, which was great because they had recently changed the direction of a bunch of one-way streets near our hotel, so some of the taxis had a hard time finding our hotel.

Breakfast is served at the beautiful rooftop bar and restaurant, as well as lunch and dinner. We especially enjoyed this green and quite oasis, where you can enjoy tasteful food in the most lovely environment. Staff is very professional and especially friendly. My special thanks and recognition to kind Monsieur HAFIDI from reception, who planned for us a whole discovery tour of Casablanca, including taxi service, the best ocean front restaurants in town and a fantastic day…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2019,4,Very Neat,"Stayed at this place on the last night of a trip to Morocco and was not disappointed. Everything works, it’s clean and quiet. There is a pretty good rooftop bar and restaurant though my lunch of duck was a little odd. All in all, pretty good.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2019,4,Great Place to stay in Casablanca,"We stayed in Le Doge the first two nights of our Casablanca holiday. Loved the boutique nature of the hotel. Atmospheric roof terrace serving Moroccan breakfasts and dinners.Enjoyed them all! Helpful and friendly staff. Easy walk to the Medina, the impressive new Mosque, and to 'Rick's cafe'. We were lucky as a 'walk in' for lunch at the latter but would advise booking.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2019,5,Stopover en route,"My small party had an enjoyable short stay at this centrally located hotel in Casablanca. It is nicely positioned in a small, quiet street off a busy main road. Boutique accommodation in a restored Art Deco building with a lovely ambience. Very nice breakfast on the rooftop lounge looking over the residential neighbourhood of the central city and nearby park. Staff were friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this hotel to travellers visiting Casablanca.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2019,5,Beautiful Art Deco hotel,This hotel is a bit pricy compared to other options but I completely enjoyed the decor and the service. The room was so comfortable and the room is aesthetically pleasing. I love the fresh flowers— a very pleasant touch. The bed is heavenly. I adore Morocco and want to come back again soon with family and friends. Would definitively revisit this charming hotel!,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,5,"Small Boutique, Comfortable, Quiet, Enjoyable Food and Service","We stayed two night, once at the beginning of our trip and again at the end; we got to stay in two different rooms (Guitry, and Fitzgerald). We prefer Guitry because the room is in the back, it is quiet, and has a lovely garden patio with table and chairs to sit and enjoy. The Fitzgerald is large, is in the front of the hotel, faces the street which is quite, but we were able to hear the dogs barking at night, but there is really no traffic, so it's quiet, but not as quiet as a back room. Both rooms are comfortable, the beds have nice sheets and are comfortable and the rooms are large with shower and tub. You cannot go wrong with either room. The Fitzgerald room is larger than Guitry, but Guitry has a patio. The rooftop is very lovely. It has a retractable roof and windows.…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,5,Art Deco Casablanca,"A boutique hotel full of charm, glam and personality! Le Doge is a beautiful hotel that the art deco design simply match the vibes of Casablanca. It was located in a quiet street near L'Eglise du Sacre-Coeur and the medina is within walking distance. Each room has a different theme name after famous art deco artists and designers. I like the little touch of luxury by putting a punch of Casablanca in the room and the fruits and chocolate in the morning and evening. The hotel response quickly to my request and very kindly to offer a room at higher floor for me. It made my stay perfect in Casablanca.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,5,A perfect refuge,"At the end of a fantastic month in Morocco, we arrived on the early morning flight from Fes, to spend a day and half in Casablanca before flying home. We had figured on dropping our bags at the hotel and then going out to explore the city until check-in time. My wife, unfortunately, got sick our last day in Fes, and was in no shape to be exploring and only wanted to rest. The staff at the Doge were SO accommodating: They set us up in the cafe with mint tea (of course) and told us they'd get us into a room as soon as they could-- which turned out to be around 10:30 a.m. and in a higher category room than we had paid for. They wrote off any early check-in surcharges or charges for the upgrade, and throughout our stay made inquiries into how my wife was feeling. The room was…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,1,Surprised by a Terrible Experience,"My husband and I have stayed at different hotels under the same brand so expected a high-level of service at this location. We were surprised as to how terrible of an experience we had during our last nigh in Casablanca and if I could give this location a zero or even negative points I would. 1. We were on the way to Le Cabestan and asked the front desk the best way to get there, the front desk person suggested we take a taxi, showing us where it was on the map. We then asked how much it should be since we had gotten ripped off the first night. He didn't offer to get us a cab, but we ventured out and it took us time to find one. However, when we finally were able to get into a cab at the higher rate. As tourists, we don't know the city so didn't feel like we could say anything.…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 February 2019,5,Boutique art deco pearl,"The place to stay, when in Casablanca ☀️- and to have a genuine Moroccan meal in the most beautiful restaurant, Le Jasmine! This fine little boutique hotel, art deco style, 16 rooms only, located perfectly in the historic art deco area right in the city center buzz, but where it’s calm, close to the old medina, a beautiful palm tree park and within walking distance to the mosque by the ocean. The rooftop is bathed in sunshine and Le Doge Café there is open all day and serves breakfast and tasteful Mediterranean meals and snacks nonstop. There is a little spa and I had the best hammam experience.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,Very nice art deco hotel,"Staying at this hotel was lovely. It's on a quiet block in an art deco district. Each room is fashioned differently and there is a restaurant on the roof. The room was large, with a patio and large bath. I loved the attention to detail like the doorknob. I was on the first floor and wasn't distracted by road noise at all. Each room has a name. The only one I remember right now is the Fitzgerald.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,4,Nice hotel in Casablanca,"This is one of very few boutique hotels in Casablanca! We stayed one night and our room was called ""Coco Chanel"". Very cute interior and really lovely staff.. our room was nice and comfortable. The location is slightly hard to find given the street entrance, but the location is extremely central. We enjoyed our stay. Only thing is the check in takes a long time if you go up for the mint tea.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,A wonderful end to our Morocco trip!,"We stayed at the Hotel Le Doge for our final night in Morocco and it was a perfect ending to our trip. The rooms are beautifully designed and decorated, the hotel is in a quiet setting and the service was impeccable. My only regret is that I didn't have more time to try out the luxurious soaking tub in my room!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,A luxurious and calm oasis in a bustling city,"To Casablanca for a few days work. The hotel is tucked away in a narrow side street near the magnificent Sacre Coeur cathedral. It’s moments from a major thoroughfare, but very quiet; my room at the back especially so. The interior decor throughout is dramatically art deco, and every detail has been paid attention to. Rich colours, period- style furniture, excellent lighting, wafts of argan fragrance suffusing the public areas. A very comfortable bed with exceptionally soft linen and duvet. Huge black marble bathroom with one of the largest marble baths I’ve ever seen in an hotel, separate large shower. Top end toiletries. Breakfast was served in the enclosed rooftop restaurant. Good selection of breads, eggs done to order. Fresh fruit coupes with house yoghurt, home made…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,4,"Loved the hotel, but not much to do or see within walking distance","Great service, loved the boutique feel, food was great. Just wished there were more walking opportunities around the hotel. Each room had a different theme - which added the charm. Great local white wine in the restaurant too.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,4,Exceptional boutique hotel,"We stayed in a ground floor suite with a terrace that was perfect for our three night stay. The staff were very helpful, they even parked our car and looked after it for the duration of our stay. Unfortunately breakfast is not included in the high room rate, fortunately we found a very adequate restaurant for breakfast within two minutes walk almost opposite the cathedral!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2018,4,There but for wash cloths goes the fifth star,We selected this hotel for its membership in R&C and were not disappointed. Very interesting hotel and the ambience and rooms were as described and expected. The staff was both congenital and attentive but not all spoke English and our French is limited - and our Arabic non-existent. That likely resulted in the only deficiency - we kept asking for wash cloths and did not get any - but that was offset by the many other kindensses,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,5,Outstanding dinner experience,"Perfect combination of food quality (excellent French & Moroccan cuisines), environment (roof top view on the old 'art déco' Casablanca) and service (among the best in Morocco). I only had meals at the restaurant, and never stayed in the hotel (have lived in Casa 3 years), but if the hotel is like the restaurant, this is must be a unique experience, quite authentic. Service was very nice, rapid and tailored to our needs. Probably the best Moroccan food I had in Casa. View from rooftop is breath taking, and it is unique in the sense that you see mainly art déco buildings which have been restored.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,5,A highlight in Casablanca,"This hotel has rooms and amenities to die for. Every room is different and named for someone famous, with the room amenities appropriate for that individual. The staff is the friendliest, their breakfast delicious with lots to choose from, and their upstairs lounge a nice place to relax. Loved our stay there",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,5,cocktails at the bar,"What an oasis in Casablanca! Beautiful setting with a short but lovely drink list. The accompanying snacks are delicious and the service is amazingly attentive and Rachid made our stay well worth the visit. Highly recommend for a comfortable, civilized respite.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,5,Excellent Stay,"The staff was very friendly, helpful and attentive. The room was very nice. The food in the two restaurants was some of the best hotel food I have had. We had dinner at another restaurant one night which was top rated and it did not compare to the hotel Moroccan restaurant. We would stay at Le Doge again.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,5,"Great service, perhaps a bit overpriced","Stayed here for one night before heading to Marrakech. The hotel itself is located down a small side-street, which makes for a quieter setting than other hotels in the area. The staff is very helpful and well-versed in multiple languages, providing recommendations for restaurants, obtaining reservations, and helping with airport transportation. My room (Majorelle) was on the fifth floor and had more than enough space - large bathroom, small balcony, sitting area. The room was clean, although there was a slight smell when turning the AC on. There's a nice rooftop area, with decent views of the city where they serve meals. One thing I noticed was that the pricing for meals was quite overpriced relative to restaurants in the area, with the servings being quite small. Overall, an…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,3,Great hotel with a sour end,"Stayed here for one night, the hotel is beautiful with a boutique feel and Moroccon heritage Breakfast was sensational the staff and cooks wonderful We left on a sour note however with the staff claiming we broke a vase in the room. They ran out to stop our car before we left saying the cleaners had entered our room within 5 mins of me leaving the room and found a “broken vase” so lucky we had our private tour guide with us as god knows what would have happened. Would stay here again but the end put a massive sour taste in our mouths so probably unlikely",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,5,Style and comfort in Casablanca,"Warm, welcoming reception for travel weary couple. We enjoyed the complimentary mint tea and cookies on the terrace while our room was prepared (we arrived early). Brilliant Art Deco styling, that shows that style and comfort go together.

 October 2018,5,An island of calm in the midst of Casablanca,"This small, elegant Art Deco hotel has lovely attentive staff...a fabulous Moroccan restuarant with exquisite decor and service.

The entire staff.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2018,5,Best Place in Casa,"Ended up 3 nights in Casablanca which was a little too long for a tourism stay but this hotel made the stay wonderful. The staff and food were excellent. Our room was the Chaplin room which had an outdoor courtyard - great for smoking a cigar. Bathrobes and slippers supplied. Our arrival was after midnight so we opted for a more expensive hotel call out taxi, but it really wasn't necessary as it is very safe to hire a taxi at the airport.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2018,5,loved our brief stay in Le Doge,"We only spent one night here before catching our early morning flight home the next day. Our experience started off well. The rooftop restaurant was a convenient, relaxing and good place to eat and recharge when we arrived tired and hungry after the trip from Marrakech. We had the 1st floor suite with a great little private outdoor patio. The front desk managers helped us line up a good dinner spot and an early morning taxi to the airport.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2018,3,Pleasant hotel on a quiet block,"While the art deco themed rooms seem a bit forced and the green velvet wallpaper in our room was a bit much, the room itself was comfortable and spacious with good light and decent internet. While we had a ""balcony,"" it was not large enough to actually stand or sit on. Two things happened during our stay, however, that make me wonder about their professionalism and commitment to customer service. The first was that the elevator was not in service during our entire stay. While they did mention this and apologize in passing when we arrived, they didn't even offer so much as a complementary cup of coffee to acknowledge the inconvenience. Second was that the water was off for a good part of one day during our stay - not just for the hotel but for the entire neighborhood. When I…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2018,3,Tired,"Centrally located and a comfortable hotel but not memorable. The door leading onto the terrace was broken, the air conditioning controls fell out of the wall, the shower had weak water pressure and there was no extraction fan.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2018,4,A good hotel but could be better.,"The assistance given and friendly service is fantastic. The bed is very comfortable and to have an open area to work in is great. However this had to be tempered against lift replacement works that continue until gone 2230 hours. No warning was given to guests that this was going to happen and when you have to get up at 0400 for a flight then this really is not a restful place to stay. For a five star hotel it is lacking in certain areas. Plus points are the staff, the location and the food. Minus points are no turn down service, no bathrobes and the noise. The hotel offers money exchange as long as it’s not GBP but a short walk will get you to a bureau de change who will change you money. Alcohol in the bar is expensive compared with local establishments.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2018,5,Art Deco and great service,"This charming hotel was great for our three days in Casablanca. It looks like there are only 16 rooms here, but with two restaurants, attentive front desk and doormen, I’d have thought they were staffed to serve a bigger group. The decor is a great throwback to 1920, and the location is awesome.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 May 2018,4,Casablanca charm,A wonderful first night in Morocco. Lovely room and roof top bar and restaurant lounge. The staircase is beautiful as are the art deco details throughout. It is a tiny bit worn around the edges but still stylish and enjoyable. Nice mint tea and cookies as a welcome when we arrived.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,5,Well placed boutique hotel with great food,"Spent 3 nights total at Le Doge in 2 different rooms. Both were very spacious and comfortable. The hotel is well positioned on a quiet street within easy walking distance of some of the busier areas of Casablanca. There are 2 restaurants - a classic Moroccan on the ground floor and a more eclectic International one on the roof where breakfast is also served. We ate twice in the Moroccan restaurant and, as there were a couple of weeks between our first and second stays I ate the same main dish both times - a very good tagine of monkfish and shrimp beautifully spiced. My wife had a chicken tagine the first time and requested and was given the same dish as me without the monkfish. In the international restaurant I had a superb meal of swordfish carpaccio followed by beautifully…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,5,Excellent value and great accommodations,"We really liked this hotel. They gladly accommodated a very early check in (gave us cookies and mint tea while our room was prepared) and treated us very well throughout our stay. The room was exceptional- beautiful velvet textured wallpaper, nice furniture, a clean bathroom, and a very comfortable bed. The terrace restaurant is nice. They offer a nice breakfast buffet and it’s more of a bar/lounge at night. A bit smoky for us, but that’s the way it is. The staff is friendly and very customer focused. You’re a short walk to the Medina and about 25mins to the Mosque. We’ve paid way more for hotels not nearly this nice. Highly recommended.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2018,5,Art Deco Boutique,"A perfect ""welcome"" to Morocco. The vibe was an interesting blend of romance and intrigue.

 April 2018,5,A lovely introduction to Casablanca,"On our first night in Morocco we stayed at the Hotel le Doge, a charming hotel full of art nouveau detailing, tucked into a quiet street. I'd been a bit concerned when booking a ""standard room"" that we'd find ourselves squeezed into a small space, but I need not have worried. Our room (Loukili) was spacious and resplendent in blue velvet walls. In addition to a comfortable, queen-size bed, the room included a sitting area with a comfortable upholstered chair and a table upon which stood a vase of fresh flowers. The bathroom was spacious as well, and the only downside for us was that the shower was a hand-held/wall mounted unit above a massive tub—a little bit of a challenge to get in and out of without slipping). A full array of toiletries was provided in the bathroom (not…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2018,5,Beautiful and comfortable,"This is one of the nicer hotels I have ever stayed in. The hotel is beautiful, with an overall art deco theme. We stayed in the Moulay Loukili room, which was decorated in dark blue and was incredibly cozy. Glimpsing through open doors, some of the other rooms appeared more open and light. The staff was very friendly and attentive and gave us a good recommendation for dinner down the street. The restaurant in the hotel looks beautiful (and quite upscale), but we did not get the chance to eat there (it looked crowded, so you may need to book ahead).

That said if you are looking for a five star pristine elegance I felt that this hotel Didn’t really hit that mark. Our room had an incredible canopy bed with fantastic artwork and great paint colors but we were on the ground floor and with a deck that was right out on the street so it was not ideal. It’s also a difficult hotel for entering and exiting due to its location on the side street. That said I thought the staff was really nice and because we had to leave very early in the morning they put together an extra early breakfast just for our group which was kind and generous of them and truly appreciated!!,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The hotel accommodated our early check-in and hospitably served us traditional mint tea and cookies on the roof terrace before guiding us to our room. The entire hotel has a striking art deco decor. The online photos don’t do it justice. We stayed in the Mallet room, which was roomy and elegantly decorated. We loved the marble bathroom with a soaking tub, bath salts, and his and her sinks. The mini fridge offered complimentary water, soda, and juice, which was a thoughtful touch. My husband loved the plush bed, which was a rare change from the firmer beds more typical in Moroccan hotels and ryads. Our room was quiet with a lovely balcony to sit outside as well. We didn’t have an…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,5,Awesome one night stay !,"Had a fabulous stay at hotel le doge. I booked thinking I would have some down time to kill in the morning as I arrived in Casablanca airport at 6am. When I arrived at the hotel they let me up to the rooftop for some tea and cookies - I got to soak up the sun until they let me into my room an hour and a bit later (still very early in the morning!) I was pleasantly surprised but the spacious room, super comfy bed, fabulous bathroom and cute patio. I enjoyed both dinner and lunch up on the rooftop and had a great meal each time. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going through Casablanca!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,5,What a perfect little suprise pacjage,"I can only speak in glowing terms of our two night stay at Le Doge. Everything from booking to airport transfer was executed with ease and politeness. Our room in this ( I call it a Riad in Casa) was so lovely and typical of Moroccan design.. and smelt if orange blossoms. The hotel was sparkling clean! I loved the little touches... expresso machine in my room, Moroccan almond pastries each day and complimentary bottles of water. Its these extra touches that for me make a memorable impression. Oh and the bed... heaven. Also for us an added bonus was the rooftop restaurant. What a perfect place for breakfast and dinner. The food on all occasions exceeded our expectations and the service was exemplary. We caught petit taxis to the major attractions and found it easy and not…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,3,As long as you like the scent....,This is a pretty hotel on a quiet street in. Casablanca. The staff was nice but we found it odd that they have scent diffusers on every floor. At first we thought the man at reception was wearing too much cologne but we later realized what it was. We didn't particularly like the scent which turned us off to the hotel. There were some other near misses. I booked a massage and then sat in the small spa room looking at peeling paint for 30 min before anyone acknowledged that my appt would. be late and this was only after I complained to the front desk. There were also some areas we found dusty. None of this was terrible but it stopped the hotel from getting more stars. We also found the rooftop bar to be extremely expensive.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,3,OLD!!,"Tired & characterless. Very difficult to access by car. Large room but dark & dowdy. No operating manuals for fittings/facilities. Sleep disturbed by barking dogs.Room phone to front desk not working necessitating several trips to reception to report problems. 3 technicians unable to tune in English TV channels. Mediocre roof cafe - no early breakfast facility. 3 star rating at best,",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,5,Great short stay,"We were here 2 nights ,one with a ground floor room and once on the 2nd floor . Both were well equipped but the ground floor one had a much better porch .

Quiet location .",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,4,Enjoyed our short stay,"We spent 2 nights at this hotel. Once after arriving in Casablanca and one before leaving (after spending 2 weeks in Morocco). Both time our rooms were comfortable and well-appointed. The hotel staff were very pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed. We had the breakfast buffet once but didn't get a chance to have dinner. The location on a side street makes it a quiet hotel which was welcomed by us after a long flight. All in all, a pleasant hotel.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2017,5,Couldn't fault it.,"Stayed one night having arrived fairly late from the airport. The room was very special - what appeared to be wallpaper was actually a fabric covering. Good facilities, but there's a charge for the Nespresso pods, although soft drinks are complimentary. Breakfast on the roof was excellent. It's difficult to find down a sidestreet, but that means it's quiet. Low level lighting in the room added to the ambience but made finding stuff in the suitcases difficult. A minor niggle.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,5,Loved the ambience,"Really happy I chose this Art Deco hotel to overnight at in Casablanca before commencing a 19 day tour of Morocco with my friend. Initially I was annoyed our room wasn’t ready when checking in at 3.30pm however management appeased the situation by offering mint tea on the rooftop and upgraded us from our booked executive room to a junior suite. Room was very clean, well appointed and equipped with 2 small balconies. Bathroom amenities were gorgeous and I loved the bath and shower. Funny moment when we realised no bath towels so had to dry myself with a hand towel and get some towels later. Rooftop cocktails were fantastic as we watched the sun set as was breakfast from this viewpoint next morning.

 October 2017,4,Wonderful hotel,My husband and I spent 1 night at Le Doge Hotel before joining a tour. What a fantastic stay we had. Our flight arrived early morning and our transfer from the airport to the hotel was waiting for us. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived but the staff made us feel very welcome and directed us to the rooftop terrace where we could have breakfast. An hour later we were given access to the Josephine Baker room. Absolutely beautifully decorated and space for miles! The staff were friendly and very helpful with restaurant tips and directions to places of interest.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,4,Almost perfect,"We stayed at Le Doge on our way home from Morocco. It was a lovely (if hard to locate) hotel in the busy Casablanca. Upon arrival, we immediately made reservations for the lux Hamman. We enjoyed the moroccan Hamman in the hotel immensely. It was a truly lovely oasis, and thew lady who massaged an bathed us was truly superb. We also ate at the rooftop restaurant. I thought this was a bit on the pricey side, but the food was good, and it seemed like a place to see and be seen for Casablanca residents. The room itself was lovely. We had the Coco Channel room. Really top notch bedding, and lovely claw foot tub. The only mar in the stay was when we went to check out. The gentleman at the the front desk in the morning -6 a.m was rude and cold.

 October 2017,3,Too expensive for the provided services,"Good:We arrived late and they provide an upgrade for free. The taxi driver set for the hotel was an excellent driver. Not that good: Doesn't look like a 4*, outdated for the price point. I had to send them three emails before receiving an answer to book a taxi to pick up us from the airport. The room was dark. The bathtub too high and was difficult to get out. When we did the check out we request them to call us a taxi and they ignore our request, we walk outside to pick up one ourselves. It may be good for a few days but for a one night sleep you'll be able to find much better options.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,4,Oasis in a sea of dust,We stayed overnight before a flight home. The hotel was comfortable and all of the people we met there were very helpful and friendly. Our room was very nice ( we had a junior suite at a reasonable cost). The rooms are all themed around literary or artistic figures and done well. We loved the Moroccan restaurant and will review it separately. Much of that area of Casablanca though seems to be under a large repair project. There is dust and construction work in a lot of places and some of the nearby places are closed for it. It looks like that is sorely needed in some of those areas and should make for some great finished projects. At present though the hotel stands a bit in a neighbourhood of building or potential projects. It doesn't affect the hotel's service but the city…,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2017,4,Romanticism in style,"Le Doge is an Art Deco themed hotel with its rooms named after some legends in the prior years, each has its unique and tastefully decorated theme. My wife and I spent one night in the ""Coco Chanel"" room on the 1/F of this lovely boutique hotel. We felt that we were back in time in the yesteryear with that sense of class and luxury. The room and bathroom were spacious and the decoration was carefully coordinated to create the characteristic of the icon and we appreciated it; however there were some minor points for improvements: 1. There was on TV signal though it was a newly installed LED TV; 2. Wifi signal was very weak at times; and 3.

 September 2017,5,Brings a smile to my face,"Le Doge is a beautifully appointed Art Deco hotel that to a non-Moroccan speaker, has, at times, a slightly flawed ""Faulty Towers"" feel but with a happy ending. The staff here are exceptional. They could not do enough to make our stay welcoming and memorable. The rooms are delightful, the roof-top terrace a gem, and the spa a real treat. Proximity to the Port, medina and French quarter is within easy walking distance and the hotel can organise just about any tour you could think of.

As our room was not quite ready on arrival we were offered tea on the rooftop terrace which is where we also had dinner and breakfast the following morning. However, one incident put a dampener on our stay. We arrived after a very long flight from Australia which was followed by a further fours hours to get to the hotel due to long queues at immigration and a mix-up with our pre-arranged pick-up. We were exhausted. On arrival the female staff member at reception was particularly unwelcoming and made us feel uncomfortable.

I had to prepare for my trip so he took me to an electronic store to buy a phone then to buy a SIM card and helped with getting me a car.

All the rooms are apparently different, but I can say the Majorelle (they have names, not numbers) is lovely. Spacious, nicely decorated and the most comfortable bed I found in all of Morocco (most of them are hard as rocks) - and a true double bed. The staff was friendly and helpful and the roof deck is very nice. They give you mint tea and tasty cookies on the terrace upon arrival. Breakfast is also on the terrace and you have a choice of a buffet or a la carte, The buffet is a little expensive compared to most of the food in Morocco (about $19 U.S.), but it is a nice spread. Although I did order eggs and they came out drowned in a pound of butter - totally inedible.

We were also told that all nearby restaurants were closed and only one store, selling drinks only, was open. Our room on the ground floor had a hedge-lined courtyard, but we decided to keep the courtyard door locked. In addition, and despite our request for twin beds, the bed was a large double. The in-room flowers were well past their prime. The huge bath was sumptuous, but highly impractical. We found the store selling ""only drinks"" and bought bread, cheese, meat, butter and fruit. Next day, we found that if we had walked in the other direction for about 5…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Le Doge is an easy walk from Casablanca's modest and rather disappointing medina. There are a number of restaurants nearby, but we elected to have dinner at the hotel. We had the first of many tajines there, and the lamb was excellent, as was the all-Morocco (or perhaps mostly Morocco) wine list.

 April 2017,4,A good choice for a short visit to Casablanca,"The website clearly shows the 'image' that is being created. We were in the Fritz Lang room. From the huge marble bathroom to the circular staircase with the brass handrail and wrought iron, or the 4 person lift the 1920s came to life. The bed was huge and the linen wonderful. The roof terrace for meals is excellent, apparently it only opened the previous Friday. The breakfasts are very good and we ate our evening meal there twice. The range of choices on each course was good with Moroccan or western options. The staff there and throughout the hotel were very welcoming and helpful.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The staff were professional and always on top of their game in providing exemplary service throughout the hotel. Our Charlie Chaplin room was charming, comfortable and spacious. We sat in the gorgeous library before dinner to have a cocktail. Best of all was our dining experience in the hotel's gorgeous, intimate restaurant, Jasmine. Dinner entrees are dramatically presented in tagines and were delicious, providing a taste of Moroccan cuisine. Breakfast in the same room in the morning sunlight was just lovely.

We witnessed an armed carjacking a block from the hotel while unsuccessfully trying to walk to a restaurant. Aside from no shower and an intrusive housekeeping that barged into the room without knocking, the staff was incredibly rude. There was a misunderstanding with breakfast and the staff became extremely accusatory and disrespectful.

All clean and well furnished.The lighting was very low so arriving at night made finding things in the suitcase very difficult. We had a private patio but did not use it during our 1 night there. The main problem was that the patio and bedroom were very near to the road and whilst this was a residential area there was a lot of noise from people walking by and bin men.

By the time my husband was done with his shower we had water everywhere in the bathroom so I decided not take one.

 January 2017,4,"Quirky, Interesting and Surprisingly Quiet","There were 4 things that were good and 2 that were not so good. The road into the hotel is impossibly small but this meant there was none of the chaotic traffic and noise that dominated the main street we came off (it was very serene - good). The first impression on entering the hotel and the bar, where we were sat for mint tea, was that this hotel was going to be interesting / quirky. It lived up to that expectation - each room was named after and designed with a writer in mind. We had Scott Fitzgerald and thus lots of 1920s and the jazz age (though the opulence would have surprised Fitzgerald who was did not achieve fame until after his death). The well appointed (if not large) rooms and public areas is definitely a plus. However, our rooms were not ready and the person…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Styling was masculine as per the theme and all very comfortable - loved the bed plush with great linen. The bathroom did not have the range of toiletries that you would get in a chain 5 star hotel which was a bit disappointing given the price point.

Unbeknownst to us it was an easy walk to the Casa Port train station, so with the help of Muhammad the concierge we were able to easily leave town and even soak in a little more Casablanca culture on the way. Had we done a little research we probably could have taken the train from the airport, but the taxi was only 300 dirhams (about $30). Our room wasn't immediately ready, so we were shown to the beautifully decorated library to drink mint tea and eat cookies while we waited. The room itself was small but beautifully decorated and immaculate... although perhaps a bit TOO small for myself and my father. Also, neither the Nespresso machine nor the bathroom sink drain…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,4,Stylish Art Deco Hotel.,Super Friendly and efficient check-in. Clean and large room. Very Comfy bed. Annoying coffee machine but otherwise no complaints! A good find and a good location. I would stay here again and I will recommend it.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,Deco Darling in Casablanca downtown,"Such a shame we only had the one night. We were lucky enough to get the Coco Chanel room which is so beautifully decorated. Enjoyed plenty of hot water in the bathroom, super fast wifi and blissfully comfortable bed. Had a very nice meal in the restaurant which is another amazingly decorated room. Super quiet. Highly recommended.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,5,Fantastic!!,"We stayed at Le Doge our first night in Morocco, and had the most amazing meal that we would have the whole trip! Eat in the restaurant and have the Lamb Tagine. Incredible! The breakfast was also extensive, and tasty. The staff could not have been more helpful in every way. The room was absolutely gorgeous, (although the bathtub was huge and weird, kind of a big roman tub with straight sides). We definitely recommend this hotel.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,5,"Beautiful place, lovely staff, well situated","Gorgeous art deco hotel, with friendly helpful staff and located in the colonial city center yet very quiet. Rooms, including the bathrooms, are large and well appointed. We were fortunate to have a patio in the Sasha Guitry room (most rooms looked like they had balconies), and enjoyed sitting on the patio (though lots of pigeons). Even though there is air conditioning, it was nice to have the sliding door open for fresh air. When the grand theater is completed, it will be a quick walk to and from a show. A bit hard for taxis to find as it's off a small one way street/alley, but just around the corner from another hotel on the main street.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,4,Charmer in Casablanca,"Charming small hotel on a small side street just off a main drag in downtown Casablanca. Very nicely furnished in the Art Deco style.

 October 2016,5,Charming Spot in Casablanca,"Hotel Le Doge is a renovated house in the old part of the city. It is located on a narrow street that our driver from the airport had never been on before but he found it nonetheless and we were so pleased that he did. It is a nicely appointed art deco hotel with 16 suites. We stayed in the Coco Chanel Suite on the second floor, next to the breakfast room and at the top of the lovely spiral staircase. Our suite was nicely appointed with a comfortable bed and large tub. The hotel staff provide great service at all levels. Breakfast is served in a beautiful moroccan style dining room and provides lots of choices. Try the customized omelet. So delicious. Room service offers the same menu as the restaurant.

 October 2016,2,5 star price for a 3 star experience,"We arrived at night, and were shocked by the hotel location, situated on a super narrow street in an area that looked a bit like a war zone. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, but the place was run down and dirty. We stayed in the Mackintosh Room on the 4th floor, and after exiting the dilapidated wooden elevator barely large enough for 3 people, we noticed that the upholstered chair outside our room had large dark stains on the seat and was generally worn. The room was small and cramped, the bed cover was stained, one of the bedside lamps was broken and patched up with electrical tape, there was only one bath towel and no wash cloths, and the shower was filled with mildew, My luggage was delayed so I didn't have any toiletries, and the front desk had nothing to…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2016,5,Voyage au bout des sens,"The Doge, located in the heart of the ""Art Deco"" district of Casablanca is full of unexpected surprises ! First of all I want to emphasize this sensory journey that they offer thru their oriental spa and their traditional Hammam ! For the first time in my life, I'd been scrub amazingelg, that inspired me to relax, through the sweetness of the lady when she rubbed. Oriental odors were present well from beginning to end, I've even been flavore with natural orange blossom after my hammam. And of course, after finishinf my hammam, I went to the rest room, where a nice jug of fresh orange juice and a masseuse were waiting for me. What esle can be better ? A big thank you to the Doge's team for allowing me to escape myself a few hours of reality because I was in a daydream !",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,5,One night is not enough to stay in this little drop of history,Thoroughly charming art deco hotel which takes you back to the Casablanca hey days of the 1930's. Exquisite decoration and attention to detail in every room which are all individually decorated. A little drop of Moroccans near history to compare with the ancient. Amazing bathrooms. Loukili has the most incredible ceiling. Perfect stopover.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2016,5,Beautiful Art Deco Hotel,"We only stayed one short night in this beautiful boutique hotel in Casablanca.

 December 2015,5,Charming Casablanca experience,"Casablanca carries with it an aura of splendor, romanticism and glamour. It is difficult not to think about the namesake movie when you are planning your Moroccan trip. Therefore, I believe you have to try this charming boutique hotel for a true Casablanca experience. It does not have the modern look and that's exactly why you want to stay there. Each room has a different ambiance and the food is reliable, with a great space for reading in their library. The staff is excellent, provides important and useful tips, is always available.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,4,Art Deco experience in the heart of Casablanca,"This boutique hotel will appeal to the artsy and is a step back in time to the thirties. Each room is themed on a famous person - ours was Jacques- Henri Lartigue - a famous French photographer. His photography work and decorations of the period adorned the room. An eclectic old boutique hotel with excellent service. great French styled restaurant. Being used to international 5 star hotels a few issues we not to our expectations, however overall we enjoyed our stay and the experience.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,5,Great Rooms and Service,"One of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in, excellent service, we were there only two separate nights so we did not see much of the immediate area.

 September 2016,5,Casablanca charm in Art Nouveau style,"Spent two nights in this beautiful boutique hotel. There are only 16 rooms/suites and it is worth staying here to admire the decor. My room has magnificent mirrors, cornices and photography all in the style of 30's Art Nouveau.

 September 2016,4,Would definitely return,"We had only a short time in Casablanca and are glad we booked this charming place. Loved the individual decor of the rooms. You'll want to take a peek into each when housekeeping is at work, as they're all unique with nice touches. Beds are comfy and linens are nice. (You may need extra towels. As other reviews have mentioned, the claw foot tubs look great, but if you prefer a shower, prepare for wet floors!) There's not too much within quick walking distance (except the cathedral, which is lovely), but cabs are cheap in town and Uber is not much more. The hotel is on a quiet side street that some drivers have trouble finding. They have a tiny map card in their brochure - bring it with you when you're out to make sure the taxi knows where you're going. Breakfast is a bit…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,5,Hidden Gem,"The hotel is a real gem in the middle of Casablanca: A villa with customized rooms where each room has its own design, the staff is extremely friendly and passionate about their work and amazing comfort and location!

 September 2016,5,Charming hotel!,"This art deco style hotel is a real gem. Don't let the reasonable price fool you, Let Doge is a beautiful, quiet, 16 room boutique hotel conveniently located in Casablanca. The high quality accommodations are surpassed only by the helpful, professional staff. And the restaurant is not to be missed. It offers the best Moroccan food in the city. Trust me, we dined elsewhere only to return for another outstanding meal. Our highest recommendation!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2016,4,Art Deco family hotel with an authentic feel,Narrow street and tight lobby. Good sized rooms. An air of authenticity with a feel of colonial Morocco.

Lovely library with comfortable leather seats.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2016,5,A slice of luxury in Casablanca,"We stayed here 1 night during a recent trip through Morocco.

 August 2016,5,"Beautiful, charming and personal!","We didn't even stay at this hotel while in Casablanca, but we ate at the restaurant, and the staff were extremely nice and helpful for us in figuring out our plans for the rest of Casablanca.

 May 2016,4,Charming Boutique Hotel,"Lovely hotel, experienced my first Mint tea show while checking in. Stayed in the Charlie Chaplin room which has a beautiful private courtyard.

 June 2016,4,great stop off,"we only stayed for half a day, as we had a 7 hour layover at Casablanca. it was perfect for this. I chose the hotel for its character and we weren't dissappointed.

We had just enough time to see the mosque, freshen up , rest and return to the airport.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2016,4,Nice stay,"This is an excellent boutique hotel tucked inside a peaceful street outside of the loud, dingy city centre. I would recommend it for the unique rooms, intimate feel and friendly staff. In addition, the hotel has a nice hammam with an experienced staff. My girlfriend and I could not have enjoyed the hammam/spa treatment more after a 12 hour flight. My only caution surrounds the 5 star rating. The ambience, decor and untimely construction sounds in early morning cause this hotel to fall short of a true 5 star hotel.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2016,5,"Despite the construction noise, this was luxe!","This oddball little place was more comfortable by Western standards than most similarly-priced accommodations I saw throughout the country. There is some English spoken by staff, but it would be helpful for guests to know French because they appear most comfortable with that. In a very French way. Firstly, we arrived early and I felt very grateful that they were able to accommodate us before check-in time. The facility and food standards are excellent. The junior suite we were assigned is not the one I thought I had reserved. It was loud with construction noise during the day and it was also over-upholstered. I have a dustmite allergy and prefer a somewhat more stark sleeping environment, but the room I'd have preferred was occupied by another guest. I should be clear that…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2016,3,A hotel impersonating Art Deco; unfortunately some flaws with room and breakfast.,"We stayed the last two nights of our trip to Morocco at the Le Doge in Casablanca. It's located in a narrow quiet backstreet, in which guards are taking care of your car. After parking we didn't have to car about our luggage and were served mint tea in the bar. Otherwise the location is quite close to the centre, about 5-10 minutes walking from Place Mohammed V and the tramway (from there 1 station to Place Nacion Unies and 2 to La Marché). We were given a room on the second floor with a nice terrace (without a view), that could have seated four people. The room itself was Art deco from top to bottom, the bathroom very well equipped with a separate bath tub and shower. The content of the minibar was for free. Lights were controlled remotely, which was unfortunately working…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2016,5,Great 2 night stay at end of Morocco trip,"Small boutique hotel, fairly central, excellent service. I must especially thank the manager, Hafidi, who was in charge the day we arrived. He was extremely helpful in arranging tours (excellent) and looking after our other needs. But the sevice throughout was excellent with very friendly and helpful staff. Only blemishes on an otherwise excellent experience were: blocked rain shower in Charlie Chaplin room and one room becoming very hot at night since AC had not been switched on (though quickly rectified when called at 4 a.m.!). Wifi in some areas is weak. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. So would have given rating four-and-a-half if that was possible. The clincher for five was that kitchen gave us their kettle to make tea at 4:45 a.m. prior to leaving for…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2016,4,A very nice (and quirky) hotel -- in an unexpected location,"Hotel Le Doge is an Art Deco hotel from beginning to end. Every room is designed around a famous person from the 20's or 30's. It's very convincing - even if a little cliche. The rooms are nicely appointed and quite comfortable, and the staff is very helpful. The hotel is in an unexpected setting - but still convenient. All in all, we liked the place very much. The Jazz Age / Art Deco theme may not appeal to everyone, but it appealed to us!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2016,5,Oasis within frantic city,"This was our first hotel in Morocco. What a fabulous place to start! While the city of Casablanca may not be interesting this hotel certainly is.

 May 2016,4,"Pleasent, short stay at Le Doge","There are only 16 rooms in this hotel and each is decorated/named after a famous person from the art deco age. We had the Charlie Chaplin and the Coco Chanel rooms, both of which were very nicely suited out. Bathrooms are very large, with two sinks each, tub and shower. Hairdryers and magnifying mirrors were welcome additions which we had missed in some other hotel/riad stays in Morocco. The restaurant is fairly small but again quite fancifully decorated. The dinner menu is not large but offers 2-3 options for starters, mains, desserts. (Do try the sorbets!) The servers were unable to answer a couple of our questions (where does the salmon come from, e.g.) but provided efficient service at table. The bread is house made, served warm and delicious.

 May 2016,5,Lovey hotel; super-helpful staff; terrible city,"The staff was terrific at Le Doge - it's too bad it isn't in a nicer city! They helped print boarding passes, call taxis, and make restaurant reservations, and answered lots of questions cheerfully. The hotel is very art deco and the room decor carries out the theme. We unfortunately cut our Marrakech stay a day short in order to see Casablanca and we sure regret it. Marrakesh was wonderful! (Unless your hotel orders the taxi, the driver is likely to rip you off. Make sure that the meter is running when you catch a cab in Casablanca.)",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2016,5,Wonderful Oasis in a very dirty town,"This hotel is a gem. Each room is named rather than numbered. Our room, Marjorelle, was so beautiful, with red damask walls and beautiful furniture. The beds were firm and comfortable and the linens were fine.

 March 2016,5,"""Wonderful Boutique Hotel""","We stayed at the Le Doge at the beginning and end of our two & a half week visit to several cities in Morocco. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this small; one of a kind hotel. The service was great, (attentive but not overbearing). All of the staff from the doormen/security to the reception staff were smart looking, courteous and worked to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable. Three couples were traveling together in our party, so we had somewhat unusual airport transfer & luggage handling requirements.

The rooms were large, well laid-out, technically current and elegantly & individually decorated based on themes of early 20th century literary and…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2016,5,Great boutique hotel,"First of all, there is a big difference between centrally located and convenient. Le Doge is centrally located, which means you aren't actually next to anything but it is located the middle of many attractions, although you are likely to hire a driver or taxi to get to those attractions. The old medina, the corniche, Hassan mosque, and Quartier Habous are all a few minutes away (in different directions) by taxi. Walking to all of those is probably a bit much, especially in the heat. The rooms are just lovely. Beautiful old wood, decor is perfect, and the bed comfortable and firm. Bathroom is exceptionally large. Very quiet at night, I couldn't hear any noise on a weekend night. We had dinner in the hotel. While slightly pricey, the food is fantastic. The service overall,…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Everything about this place has been thought out and built to perfection. The Spa was a particularly incredible and intimate experience. The couple's hammam left us feeling completely relaxed and disconnected. The products used were of top quality, the relaxation room was beautifully put together to every last little detail - from the fresh oranges, the tea selection, the rosemary water, to the large and comfortable relaxation beds and the background music.

It is located in a quiet neigbourhood within walking distance of the city centre, and the tram is not far away either. We heard the masseuse tell to another guest that she should be payed cash, and when we took a hammam with scrub a few days later brought cash. This (not English speaking woman) thought it was all a tip, and we had to pay the hotel for the hammam. Well it was our Christmas holiday so we left it like that.

You are welcomed to you room with fresh flowers, Moroccan cookies, and fruit, as well as a refrigerator that is stocked with water, juice and soda. The service from every member of the staff was exceptional. Literally anything we asked for was delivered with a smile Ina matter of minutes.

The location near the Cathedral makes it easy to find and easy to find the way out of the city. . The staff are attentive without being overbearing.

As this was our 1st night, it was a good segway into Moroccan cuisine. Breakfast was beautiful with a full buffet of fresh fruits/yogurts/cheeses/traditional breads of Morroco.

After checking into our room, appropriately named Coco Chanel, I had no doubt. We’ve entered a big epoch room, designed to emulate old glamour. The best was the bathroom. Grand black-and-white marble decorating the floor and walls, with a pristine white and brass clawed bathtub situated in the corner. Looked glamorous, but when you showered you quickly realized that it was missing something of importance. The shower curtain. So as I showered, water splashed everywhere. And when I finished with my decadent shower I spent 10 min wiping the black marble floor. Kind of sexy! Was fun to stay in this ostentatious setting!

The themed rooms are tastefully decorated and instead of room numbers, they all have their own titles. We stayed in a early 20th century starlets room and it was incredibly comfortable, very clean and roomy. The bedding was uber comfy too. The bathroom was huge, extraordinary and the tub was the most welcoming thing that I've seen in a long time. The tile work was modern and the same tile work ran from floor to ceiling. Absolutely gorgeous. They have a very nice dining room and a lounge area that was very inviting as well. The elevator was very memorable as it was the smallest one that I've ever been in.

They indicated that as part of the mini bar there was Coke and Coke Zero but there was only Pepsi and 7up and neither was sugar free so was a bit deceived about this. Internet worked on and off and had to use it outside of the room. Location was fine, walking distance to most places, though taxis also necessary. Casablanca is a busy city with much traffic and cars don't seem to pay attention to lights so be prepared for this. Staff was friendly and helpful, but don't rush to breakfast which is supposed to start at 0700 (a late time as it is) because one day nothing was set up until 0720.

Having been born and raised in this city, I only discovered Le Doge through a friend recently, and it is honestly the most unique, special boutique hotel in the city. The owners have made sure that the service and food (if you happen to be there during Ramadan, DO NOT MISS THE FTOURS, they are hands down the best in the city) have followed the aura of by-gone luxury and history that have travelled through this space. In a list of ever-growing corporate hotels in Casablanca, Le Doge stands out as a privately-owned and managed boutique hotel with a beautiful story.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2015,4,Oasis of civilization in downtown Casablanca,"We had been advised that there is nothing ""nice"" about Casablanca and no real reason to spend any time there. Well, the Hotel Le Doge was almost reason enough to visit Casablanca. It's an old mansion that has been beautifully restored and converted to a small hotel. It's on a quiet side street in a location near to some of the other restored art deco buildings, etc... Each room is unique, and since our group had 4 rooms in total, I was able to check out several other rooms besides ours. We had Youkili (hopefully I'm close on this spelling), which was the only Moroccan themed room. It was beautiful, quiet, and comfortable. The only caveat to that is that we didn't have a normal shower. Big tub with handheld shower nozzle. For a night or two, it was fine.

 December 2015,5,Cozy boutique hotel in heart of Casa- exactly what I need!,"Stayed here one night during the holidays and enjoyed it very much. It is a charming art- deco, a bit modern, little hotel, hidden in a small ally and away from the Casa craziness yet close enough to POIs- I walked to Hassan II mosque for example. Has security outside and very attentive staff. I loved the general décor and naming system of the rooms- very unique. I had the Mackintosh room that was very clean, quiet and comfortable. Other than a small incident with the shower drain, I have all but positive to say and would go back with no hesitation!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,5,Beautiful Art Deco hotel...,"An old Grand Dame of a hotel, each room was different. Mine was the Colette.... Absolutely lovely and inviting. We landed in Casablanca, and hit the ground running. After a fresh up and a delicious pastillas, --- really delicious---and mint tea in the lounge, we visited the Mosque and the Sea. Back for an early, and delicious dinner, and slept like a baby ready for our Grand moroccan adventure. I hardly recommend this hotel over the larger more modern American style hotels. It has character, history, great service and a fine restaurant. A great place to catch your breath.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,4,Very comfortable,"Location wise, the hotel is about a 10-15 minute drive from Casa Voyageurs. Most taxi drivers did not know of the address and only after some broken English pointing on Google Maps, we were able to explain our destination. The hotel and its facilities are pleasant and comfortable. A somewhat minor (but annoying) issue was that the shower screen in our room (Fritz Lang) was poorly designed such that water would drip out and wet much of the bathroom floor. There was a large bath/spa but the water was not hot enough to fill it. The service was good when, on Christmas Day (our second night), we were struck down with food poisoning (not due to the hotel). The hotel was happy to provide us with toast and mint tea for ""dinner"". The breakfast, when we had it, was great - and eggs can…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,5,Brilliant,"Staff was exceedingly helpful and gave us some unique insights into Moroccan culture. Location was superb, near the old town and in walking distance of most tourist attractions. Character of hotel was excellent as it was very artistic. We had the opportunity to stay in two different rooms (Fritz Lang and Coco Chanel) and we enjoyed their themed decor. We enjoyed moroccan tea and ""gazelle horns"" upon arrival.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,5,the hotel that made you feel at home.,back to 14th century I had Majorelle room it made me feel a bit lonely as it has an extremely romantic taste. it is a true piece of Art when you enter the Bar and Dining room. the staff is extremely nice and friendly and above all the food is amazing so you really have to think twice before booking a dinner outside this hotel. finally all I can say I've been to hundreds of hotels around the world but no doubt this one is truly different. if I ever visit Casablanca this will be my one and only place.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,4,Sophisticated design,"Every room has its own character follow literature , art or films. Nice environment , very nice bathroom. Hammam and massage are pleasant . Very good service - pick up , professional, knowledge with very good English city tour guide. Guide choose and pick best place to see in the city.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,5,Simply Great!,"Fantastic place in quiet little side street, only 16 rooms. We were upgraded to the Ernest Hemingway Suite for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed this warm, friendly place with great people, very helpful and kind. The bar next to the dining room has a baby grand piano, a fireplace, which was lit, and drinks are served here. Breakfasts are good with a young cook on duty who prepares omelettes and Moroccan pancakes, very light and sweet with honey. We missed a flight out, so we had to return and were given the flowery Lartigue room for an extra night. If you’re looking for a quiet, home-like place, this is the hotel to come to. Very nice, good people and definitely the right decision.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,5,Nice but over priced,"Good location, nice staff, above average breakfast, nicely decorated rooms. Soft drinks in the mini bar free, but coffee machine in the room counts and charges per cup. Was a bit difficult to locate but just behind the main street it is shown in the Google map.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2015,4,Lartique and Jacque cocteau,I gave 4 stars because hotel is not that perfect but its really nice the only thing i loved on this hotel was Food very very professionel and frond desk was ok service also and i liked also the historic pictures of Casablanca '' Mdina''. i was hoping to find a pool on it but its fine because this is the one of old hotels in Morocco since 1930,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2015,5,Art Deco period luxury hotel in Casablanca,"I spent one night in the beautiful Hotel Le Doge. The room was gorgeous (all named - I stayed in Majorelle) ... antique furniture throughout the hotel and in my room, very comfortable bed and sitting area in the room, large bathroom, coffee machine and fixings, free wifi and free mini bar. I had dinner in the second floor dining room next to the sitting area/library. Dinner was delicious. As there is new ownership, they have yet to secure a liquor license - so no drinks/wine with dinner. However, other than that blip, it is well worth visiting and staying here if you are in Casa!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2015,5,Beautiful Hotel,We had a fantastic stay at Hotel Doge. It is an old historical mansion built in the 30's and our room was spacious with an outdoor patio. The breakfast was served upstairs in the formal dining room and it was delicious & beautifully served. We especially loved Moushine who was incredibly helpful & kind!,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,5,A Casablanca treat to start our Moroccan honeymoon.,"The main part of our trip started in Marrakech, but the best flight combinations from Alaska ended in Casablanca. Rather than taking the train to Marrakech in a bleary, travel-worn, jet-lagged state we opted for a night in Casablanca to recuperate. Hotels in Casablanca all seem to be quite expensive compared to elsewhere in Morocco. Given that, and our limited budget, I scoured TripAdvisor for the best option. I can't imagine that any of the other options were better than Le Doge. We walked from Casa Voyageurs, carrying backpacks it took about 45 minutes, we were ""unplugged"" for this trip so I had printed out directions from Google Maps before we left home. We found the hotel easily and were greeted with a warm welcome. The greeting included mint tea and pastries in the lounge…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2015,4,Beautiful hotel,"We loved our stay at Le Doge. It is a beautiful boutique hotel. We were in the Hemingway Suite and it was lovely. We loved the fireplace in the living area and the fireplace on the terrace with its' double lounger. Fresh flowers in the room, comfortable beds and pillows, beautiful linens and a lovely decor make this a five star hotel but I had to take a star away because the bathroom lighting was really bad. They need lighted makeup mirrors or change the light fixtures. Check in was handled beautifully and baggage while we sat upstairs in the lounge and had Moroccan tea and cookies. I would highly recommend this hotel. We also ate dinner in the restaurant, the food and service were very good. It is worth the price.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,2,Great art deco design but too much interference with one's sleep,"If you like art deco, this could be the place for you. The design of the rooms, the dining room the lobby, etc all reflects that style. And the room we had was comfortable. The problem - and the reason for giving an average to poor rating - was simply noise. By 11 PM the people talking in the street outside had gone to bed, so we no longer heard them. The noise from vehicles traveling in the street or nearby road (especially the motorbikes) diminished with time as well. Which left us with one or two barking dogs which serenaded us from about 2 AM to almost 5 AM. After a heavy-duty 2 weeks of travel around Morocco, what we expected in Casablanca was to see a bit of the city and to sleep at night. You might argue that we wound up batting .500, but we checked out of the hotel in…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,4,Hidden Gem,"Located on a quiet comma of a side street in a part of the central city that has lost some luster, this residence turned boutique hotel is very nice. Its unimpressive outside presence does not match the quality of the rooms, library, delicious food and good service inside. The hotel is still waiting to get a liquor license since a change of ownership last January. We stayed in the first floor Hemingway Room, featuring two photos of ""Papa,"" dark wood paneling, and large, new leather furniture......very manly. There is a small ""rain shower"" shower, huge separate tub and a double sink vanity in the bathroom.....and a separate room altogether for the toilet. There is a fireplace and a private outside sitting area. Great king size bed. Only downside is that the room is a bit…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,5,Wonderful place to stay!,"Hidden away in Casablanca, we had an excellent experience at this old hotel! Wonderful breakfast with eggs and fresh orange juice! Beautiful rooms with a very comfortable large bed and a great bathroom! The hotel has a warm feeling to it! The decor was very nice! Service was really good as well! Our driver dropped us off and picked us up as driving in this city was and is not recommended!!!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,5,"Simple elegant rooms, kind attentive staff, quiet hidden location, so glad I found it","Summary: The staff, the rooms and the service at this hotel were so accommodating and so perfect for my 3 day business/tourism that I asked to extend my stay twice. Still reading? I chose The Hotel Le Doge based on Trip Advisor reviews and ranking, and I am so glad I did. Beautiful, quiet rooms in a kind of spare Art Deco style. Light and airy with french doors and balconies. GREAT showers (how rare is that?) Perfect breakfast in a fine morning room, several steps beyond normal hotel faire. An overall vibe relaxed and accommodating in every way. I regretted having no time for a sauna and massage. A quirky and unexpectedly delightful roof garden (with real grass) perfect for a bottle of wine under the evening sky after a good day. A gracious staff that helped me extend my stay…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,5,Magnificent,"It's rare to be able to spend time, and sleep in, an exquisite art deco architectural masterpiece complete with MacIntosh stained glass windows. Le Doge is divine, both in the public areas and the rooms. We had a Standard Double room which was spacious and gracious with a gorgeous bathroom. The room is absolutely silent at night, even if you leave your patio doors open. The breakfast buffet offers the full array of Moroccan breakfast options including Moroccan pancakes made expressly for you (and they will prepare standard eggs if that's your desire). We ate our evening meal at Le Doge and each course was delicious. We were able to park for free right in front of the hotel beside the guardhouse. We hated to leave.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2015,5,"Interesting place, central and amazing service","I loved this place So much I stayed here twice in the same week as my travels took me through Casa. First night I was upgraded into this beautiful room. I was so tired I made a couple of mistakes and the front desk guy helped me so graciousiously. They responded quickly to my emails and were responsive. Second time I stayed I was again in a lovely room and another great bathroom.. The service and ambiance was lovely.. Especially as a single female traveling solo. Centrally located, boutique hotel feel.. A good xperiene.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We (21 of us) stayed there on our arrival in Casablanca and just prior to our departure after three weeks travelling around Morocco.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2015,3,nice enough,"Nice small hotel with accommodating staff. The room was an OK size, very clean, décor is a little jarring for Americans but it is the Moroccan style and was the first place we stayed in that country. Breakfast was sparse. Overall it was fine.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 May 2015,5,Comfort in Casablanca,Our first trip to Morocco and our first place to stay. The experience set us in the mood for this cosmopolitan city. The hotel has a fine restaurant with breakfast included. Not many rooms and very well furnished. The staff was very helpful getting us started on our visit. It was also our place to stay the day before we left Morocco.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2015,4,Beautiful Hotel; Disappointing Experience,"I stayed here for my one night in Casablanca before heading to Tangier. The hotel itself is quite beautiful with its luxury decor. However, I found the staff to be a bit cold and less inviting than my experience staying at various riads during my vacation. When I arrived, no one was at the front desk and I just sat there waiting. Eventually someone came for me and brought me upstairs. The shower was a bit disappointing as the water leaked out onto the floor from the shower door. I needed to check-out of the hotel very early the next morning and breakfast was supposed to be ready for me around 6:45. When I came downstairs the man working had no knowledge of this and couldn't be bothered to assist. Eventually I asked for a cup of coffee to go and was provided it in a dixie…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2015,4,Nice but a bit Pricey,"We were originally booked in another hotel for 2 nights in July. But right before we left, that hotel informed us they could not accommodate us and so we ended up at Hotel Le Doge. The staff was professional and helpful while our room was large and beautifully decorated. The omelettes at breakfast were delicious. There was a problem with the shower in the bathroom. Instead of a shower curtain there was a glass/plastic barrier that extended only halfway across the length of the tub. This resulted in big puddles of water on the floor of the bathroom after we were done showering. We had to use every available towel to soak it up. I think the hotel staff is aware of this issue because when we left housekeeping entered the room. When we returned the mess was all cleaned up with fresh…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2015,5,Haven,"We have been travelling for 9 weeks and this hotel was just what we wanted! The rooms are huge! They are decorated in a quirky way that suits the hotel.

More importantly, in a very quiet, central area with surrounding restaurants . The bed - the best sleep in 9 weeks!!! We loved this hotel.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2015,5,Great spot,"Found a great deal on line - would expect to pay at least double to stay here. Rooms a delight. Breakfast wonderful and staff attentive and polite. A real boutique find. Sauna, steam room, Bose stereo, mini bar, fresh flowers all complimentary. Found it hard to get out of that bed.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2015,5,My Favorite,This is my new favorite place to stay. I've stayed at the Four Seasons and the L'Ermitage in Beverly Hills and they don't have anything on this place. There is just something about Le Doge. Maybe it's just the culture shock of Morocco against the tranquility of Le Doge but I have never been more comfortable on a hotel than I was here. We were there during Ramadan and were the last guests out before they closed for remodel so we were able to look in every room and they are all fabulous.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2015,5,Great position and very confortable,"The hotel was very conveniently placed in Casa, and the room ""Colette"" we were upgraded to had an amazingly confortable bed. In fact the whole hotel was very confortable and well decorated in an interesting 30's style. We ate in the restaurant in the evening and it was absolutely delicious",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2015,3,Not what I was hoping for but the bed was amazing!,"This is definitely not a Relais & Chateaux Hotel. The hotel, though lovely, is as other travellers have described: Somewhat faded. Which I suppose is charming in a way but not when the prices are this high. The service, though adequate, is by no means superb. The staff got our request wrong. My friend and I had asked for twin beds rather than a double and had reiterated that in three separate emails but when we arrived we found that the bed was a double). The staff were not able to recommend anywhere to eat when we arrived, although we later discovered by ourselves that there were a few decent options nearby. The main attraction of this hotel is the beds....it's like sleeping on a cloud.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2015,5,Hidden Gem,"Hotel and Spa Le Doge is a wonderful small French Art Nouveau Hotel hidden away in a narrow street (9, Rue Du Doctor Veyre ) in Casablanca Morocco.The rooms are beautifully furnished and very comfortable .

The Hotel is not far from the old Medina .",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2015,5,Felt like a little bit of Paris!,"This is a very unique art deco hotel beautifully decorated in a handy location in Casablanca. We were only here for our first and last nights in Morocco but the hotel is a wonderful place to start and end your trip. The rooms are all decorated with a different art deco French theme with beautiful furnishings and art works. The food was delicious and the dining room itself feels like something out of 1930s Paris. Staff were very helpful, although their English was a bit limited (can't blame them for that!). The hotel is an easy short walk from the old medina if you want to do a bit of shopping in the souk and handy to the tramline.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2015,5,great small boutique hotel,We started our first night in Moroocco with a night's stay in this beautiful gem of a hotel. The rooms were beautifully decorated and very well maintained. The service was exceptional and the breakfast was very nice. So much nicer than a bigbox hotel that seems to be the norm in Casblanca. The location was good as well.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2015,3,"Service is great, the room placement was not","We stayed in the Coco Channel room and it was right near the kitchen. Don't get a room right near the kitchen if you wish to sleep, they start prepping at about 5 am. The area around the hotel isn't safe for westerners after dark either, so if you go to Casablanca, do it in a day and skip the stay.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2015,4,Overnight stays to bookend our Moroccan exploration,"The staff went out of their way to help out in any way possible! A staff member personally walked us to a nearby store to help us buy a SIM card for our phone while another staff member ensured a small breakfast was ready for us when we left at 4:45am (even though breakfast didn't start until 7am). The rooms were spacious and the mini-fridge was stocked with complimentary waters, juices and sodas. The restaurant was cozy and served both western and Moroccan dishes. I recommend the triggerfish tagine over the chicken tagine as it was much more flavorful. Be advised the restaurant/hotel does not serve alcohol. We arranged through the hotel a hired car to pick us up from the airport. The driver's name was Youseff and he was wonderful. His English is minimal but it was…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 May 2015,3,Disappointed - Far Cry from a Relais & Chateau,"We were disappointed by this hotel. We were in Casablanca only one night to catch a flight home the next day. During our stay in Morocco (Fes, Marrakesh, High Atlas Mountains, Essaouria) we stayed in some magnificent riads and resorts. Le Doge was at the bottom of the list. I believe it has lost is Relais Chateau ranking and for good reason. The hotel looks tired. We stayed in the Ernest Hemingway room which had a small outside interior terrace. The room was satisfactory and quiet, the terrace uninviting. The dining room was strange - we were the only diners and I could see why.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2015,5,A great place to stay,"We spent the last night of our two week trip in Morocco at this hotel and we are glad we did. We enjoyed the character of the hotel from the funky yet functional room to the details in the restaurant. The location worked well for us and it was nice that we could park right outside the front door. The service was excellent from a warm welcome with tea and cookies to an efficient and friendly departure. The hotel is small and the attentive staff make you feel like you are the only guests. In addition it was an extremely comfortable hotel. The shower was great, the bed comfortable, the thermostat made it easy to adjust the room temperature and there was plenty of space in the room to spread out and relax.

The rooms are large and meticulously decorated. We stayed in two different rooms at the start and at the end of our Morocco trip. The Jean Cocteau room was particularly impressive with a small terrace attached to it. The beds are comfortable and rooms were quiet. Breakfast was served in a beautifully appointed dining room. It was varied and delicious with made to order eggs or omelets. The Moroccan crepes were very good. Unfortunately, we missed dinner on our first night because of flight delays.

Laurent, the manager, was absolutely amazing! I had to change my reservation due to a flight cancellation, and my second flight was hours late. I had called the hotel and without hesitation, they changed my reservation and car I had arranged to pick me up. Somehow, my message hadn't gotten through to the driver who picked me up and who had to wait for me for about 5 or 6 hours!

The hotel is amazing - a beautifully restored 1930s building, close to Casa Port train station. I stayed in the Coco Chanel room - spacious and clean. The bathroom with a deep free-standing bath was perfect after more than a day of travelling. Highlights include the Art Deco stained glass windows in the dining room and beautiful rooftop terrace.

While our room was not ready, (completely understandable at 8am) we were immediately offered a place for our bags and even better...breakfast. The second floor library was set up as a meeting was being held in the regular restaurant room. Nice little fireplace going and a delicious spread of pastries, yogurt, smoked salmon, sliced meats, pickled sardines, yes pickled sardines, (delicious by the way) and an offering of eggs to order by a cook stationed in the room.

While our last stay within the last year the manager, Mr. Delord, has offered me that I should send him a mail to get a special offer for our next stay. So I have done it and have not received an answer. Some weeks later I have written to the mail address of the hotel and have also not received an answer. So I have done the booking with a travel agency via internet and it became confirmed within minutes. Upon our arrival it turned out that the hotel was sold and there is a new manager.

Art deco paintings, stained glass windows and ceilings, deco furniture and lighting, bronze door handles, curvy railings on the stairs... it was an aesthetic treat. Each room is different and dedicated to a different period artist. Our room was very large and comfortable, and the bathroom was huge, with a heated towel rack and argon oil-based amenities. It's a good location in central Casablanca, not very far by car from the big mosque or from Rick's Cafe. Did not have dinner there, but feel certain it would have been first class. Breakfast was available with pretty much anything you might want. Easy to recommend this lovely place!

 October 2014,5,Lovely little gem,This lovely little hotel is a gem -- tucked away on a quiet street away from the Casablanca madness. Beautifully appointed in an Art Deco style with stained-glass windows in the lounge area makes one feel like they are in a comfortable home. Our room on the 4th floor was quiet and comfortable. The staff were professional and kind. The breakfast was quite adequate. Only (slight) complaint was that no alcoholic beverages were being served despite a 'drinks menu' in the lounge -- or in the restaurant. We couldn't get a reason as to why not. Hope this changes.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

I was very glad to return there even though we stayed at lovely Riads and hotels during the trip, none had the quality of service, the quality of food, and the attention to detail and comfort in the rooms like Le Doge. We stayed in a regular room at the beginning of the trip and a junior suite at the end. The junior suite was much more modernized having much better lighting, better seating, and a small balcony. I would strongly recommend the later. It was also nice to have an elevator as the other hotels we stayed in did not. The dinners both times were exceptional.

Bathroom tub/shower must have been designed by trolls. We were the only guests in dining room for dinner. No wonder. Food was poor quality and little variety. Breakfast is better at Holiday Inn Express. Flies on the fruit. Next time we'll stay elsewhere.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2014,4,Everything Great But The WiFi,"The Le Doge is a wonderful historic hotel. The service was great, the breakfast was wonderful, and the room quite comfortable. The 'Wi-Fi' was unusable however which was a disappointment given the cost for a room night.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2014,5,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"A nice surprise considering the elements. A quant little boutique hotel that takes you back into time. During check in we were immediately escorted to their sitting lounge where we were greeted by the manager and served traditional tea and cookies. We were then escorted by the manager to our rooms which were beautifully decorated. Each room had complimentary cookies. At night they turn your beds down and place chocolates on your pillows. The following day fresh fruits were in our room. We ordered a bottle of wine to our room, which was quite expensive but wonderful, included with the wine was three different bites for each of us. Breakfast was ok, not a big selection but was just enough. After breakfast we went to their rooftop which was a very cute place to relax. 5 minutes…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2014,5,"2nd stay, we'll come again","Different room this time, but same excellent experience, we'll come back for sure : original rooms, stylish building, nice staff, good breakfast, well located, ... nothing to complain, even price reasonably for what you get xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2014,4,Beautiful hotel...,"..but they do need to work on the service. It was not of the same standard as the hotel but I am sure it can be easily fixed. Definitely a beautiful hotel that is an oasis from a crazy city, and I would stay there again if in Casablanca.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2014,5,Stylish with excellent service,"Stayed here in two rooms with a family of 5. Stylish, beautifully decorated rooms. A light snack of fruit and nuts was waiting for us when we arrived. Breakfast buffet was excellent and one of the waitresses entertained out 1 year old while we ate. When checking out we found out that the booking (done via email) was unclear about the price, and they without much discussion accepted the lower price. Great experience, highly recommended!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2014,5,A little heaven,"We came here for a night. The service was excellent and the restaurant delicious. The staff was very friendly and the director came to welcome us. 2 minutes from the hotel, there is a great restaurant owned by a great chef. I forgot the name, but the hotel could inform you",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2014,5,"Clean, Friendly and Quiet","Utilized this hotel the first and last nights of our 11 day Moroccan tour. Hotel is very clean, staff is very friendly and rooms are comfortable and interesting. Food was very good. Staff went out of their way to ensure everything ran smoothly.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2014,5,Nice and quiet hotel,"Hotel was in the city centre and is about 20 min walk from the Mosque. It was our first visit to Casablanca so we did not know where is best to stay. I would have prefer to have stayed near the beach though as the area is nicer. We were disappointed with the breakfast. 20 Euro per person and on the level of 2* hotel. Very little choice, orange juice was not freshly squeezed which you would expect in a 5* hotel.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,5,Treated like a queen!,"I arrived at the Hotel Le Doge very ill having caught a bad bug during my travels. I needed to get home and was having many problems getting the travel insurance company to assist me. Traveling can present many challenges but none is more daunting than being very sick in a foreign country. I can only imagine how much more difficult it could have been had it not been for the wonderful people at the Hotel Le Doge. We want to thank the Assistant Director, Nawal Chakir, who was so very kind and generous to us. Also we want to thank Mohamed, at the front desk, who helped us with so many phone calls. In fact, everyone was so very helpful and went so far above and beyond what was required we will be forever grateful. The Hotel Le Doge gets big points for heart!

 April 2014,4,Central location but on a quiet side street,"Very pleasant place to stay, helpful staff and delightful Art Deco design. On the start of our four week holiday we stayed here two nights and I damaged the lenses in my glasses on arrival getting out go the taxi. Laurent was most concerned and insisted on immediately taking them to an optometrist for assessment. Within an hour I had a quote to replace the graded lenses and back repaired in 24 hours. Laurent was extremely helpful in resolving my dilemma. We had two good nights here, beds were good, breakfast did the job. Would certainly stay here again thank you Laurent and team.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,5,An art deco gem,"We stayed two nights in a suite. We took the car service from the airport which is expensive but very efficient. The check-in was quick, friendly and efficient. The hotel has been restored and furnished to a very high standard. We took breakfast on the terrace the first day and in the restaurant the second day. if you a are a light eater it would be better to take breakfast elsewhere as it is expensive, however if you like a sunsatntial meal in the the morning it is reasonable with a good choice of quality products. In truth there is not much to see in Casa but we were stopping over on our way to Rabat.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,3,Tasteful but dated,"On a quiet side street sits a small hotel that is a reminder of the Art Deco lifestyle. Stylish but a little dated. Our room, recently renovated with others, was nicely appointed, Renewed but still retained the 1920's atmosphere. The dining room and other public spaces retain their original charm at the risk of showing some ""wrinkles"". The breakfast was good but the waitstaff seemed somewhat distracted.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,5,Marvelous in Morocco,"We stayed at this property for the first and last night of our 11 day tour of Morocco. When we arrived back after 10 days Laurent and his staff welcomed us back as if we were family. Service level was excellent, good food, nicely appointed unique rooms and a beautiful roof terrace. The building is unique and tucked away on a little side street and is a little tranquil oasis in the midst of the bustling city of Casablanca.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,1,Filthy and deceiving....this should not have the Relais & Chateaux name,"On a recent last-minute trip to Casablanca, we had no time to ask for hotel suggestions but we felt comfortable when hotel staff at La Mamounia in Marrakech mentioned the Relais & Chateaux Hotel Le Doge...Thank heavens we arrived late and found a nice restaurant next door for dinner. The hotel lobby was dirty, the grand staircase had red carpeting that had not been vacuumed in months. There was dust and dirt all over. On our bed I found four dark black hairs and I actually slept fully clothed (long sleeves and pants!) because I could only imagine how dirty the sheets were. The pillows were heavy and felt like they were ten years old. I covered mine with a pashmina to sleep. The sheets were rough but some of the bathroom towels were brand new (felt like they were straight from…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2013,3,Lovely Art Deco - some infrastructure challenges,"This was the 1st hotel on our 2 week honeymoon of Morocco, we had stayed with Relais & Chateaux many times before so for us it was an obvious choice. The hotel is tucked away and we'd never have found it without a guide, first impressions were fantastic, they had laid out flower petals on the bed, clearly knowing we were honeymooners, had Moroccan tea and cakes waiting, and the hotel itself is a stunning throw back to Art Deco, which my wife and I both love. Shortly after arrival we had dinner on the roof garden terrace, it was small, but more then adequate and the lunch was quite enjoyable in the clear spring weather. Dining at the hotel is in a small restaurant (we were paying half-board so dinning in was ""compulsory""). We actually stayed in the hotel twice, once on the…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2014,2,Very Disappointing,"This does not live up to the Relais & Chateaux experiences we have had elsewhere. On check in on a Sunday we were told that the restaurant was close. We had just let our driver go so then had to put an emergency call into the Agency to get them back. Although the room was just OK the towel, robes and linens were worn and needed replacement immediately. The telephone did not work and they were unable to get it to work. The people were nice but the story kept changing when we reported to the agency that the restaurant was closed. They manage to somehow do some ""lunch"" but it was not up to our other experiences. We ended up leaving early so did not get any value for money other than a shower. The rooftop garden was a disaster and things were falling apart. I would never go…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2014,5,Helpful people at this fine hotel.,"We had no GPS so without our Moroccan driver we would never have found our hotel which is squeezed into a small very swanky residential area within easy walking distance to the main market (medina). Even taxi drivers within 1/4 mile didn't know the name or the street or hotel. IT WAS WORTH THE SEARCH ! Reviewers have written that Casablanca is a one nighter and my wife and I would agree, although as we left town for Marrakesh, we discovered the beach area which looks just like the South of France but is a taxi ride from the medina---which itself is not notable (especially if your headed to Marrakesh, Fes or Rabat). The hotel is really well done. The restaurant is decorated very nicely and the food and service were exceptional. The manager (sorry no name but he's French from…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2014,3,Disappointing,"Interesting place, nostalgic, great staff. However, the public areas were not as clean as they should be. Also, you should not stay on a sunday as the restaurant and bar are closed.... Surprising! We booked a junior suite: yes, very junior, certainly not a suite. Last, location is hard to find for taxis. Overall, very disappointing. Last I am surprised the Doge is a Relais & Chateaux: certainly not at the right level",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2014,4,Tasteful stay,"This was a unique and tasteful stay in a gorgeous art deco building in the heart of Casablanca. We did a 2 hour art deco walking tour that commenced at the church one block away from the hotel. Our room was the Scott Fitzgerald and had some photos and writings relating to the author, which really allowed us to absorb into the art deco era. The service was very personal. I like hotels where one is seated in a quiet quarter for the check in process, and the check in was done in the library area. Arrival into the bedroom was followed by lovely mint tea and cookies. The manager on duty also helped us book a lovely seafood dinner at Ostrea. Service was very friendly the entire duration. The French manager in the morning was very kind, and even offered us the hotel car to the train…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2014,4,Boutique hotel near main square,We spent two nights on two different occasions in this gem of a hotel conveniently located near Casablanca's main square that can be seen from the roof terrace. The staff could not have been friendlier and our rooms were quiet and tastefully decorated although some repairs were done less than expertly. Housekeeping is the week spot here and prevents a 5 star rating. Dust and mold appear in inconspicuous places. WiFi was spotty in one room. The food was of good quality and the breakfast buffet adequate.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,5,"Personal and friendly, individual Bijoux","Once a year I travel to Casablanca and seek to stay whenever available at Le Doge. It's a small Hotel beautifully decorated with a lot of taste. The French Director Monsieur Delord is always present to assure the best quality possible. In a country like Marroco this is a challenge as the culture is very diffrent. The understanding of service and cleanliness is not the same as for instance in Switzerland, but at le Doge I felt always very comfortable and well served. If it was a laptop to use in my room, or some cloth to be ironed nothing was too much for the crew. For sure I will come back! Best regards to all the team.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2014,4,For business,"Nice enough 'art deco' rooms and friendly service, but small and mostly, it seemed, frequented by well-off business men. At another time I would look around for a more authentic Moroccan hotel in Casablanca (or vicinity). Although the hotel is near downtown, I would rather not venture too much out there. In fact: I would skip Casablanca all together! It is an industrial city of 4 - 5 million, not something I was looking for on my vacation.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2014,5,Very beautiful room,"We had made an unrefundable reservation at this hotel and had to cancel our trip literally hours before our flight took off. The management was kind enough not to charge our credit card, based on the unusual circumstances. The hotel is not cheap, and is indeed small, yet the location and the beauty of the rooms and public spaces, as well as the service, easily make up for it. The room and the bathroom were among the most stylish I ever stayed at, as well as being very comfortable. Easily recommendable.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2013,3,Very average,"I booked the hotel based on the reviews in trip adviser and got really disappointed. First of all, the hotel is a small hotel and does't have much public area to hang out. There is not much to do in Casablanca at night and staying in a hotel that just has a small over priced restaurant was really boring. The room was spacious but our window that was facing a wall. Breakfast was too expensive compared to the local restaurants and very few items were on the buffet.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2013,2,Definitely not a five star,"After having great time at Marakesh and relatively good time at Fes this was not the ""happy ending"" we were hoping for. We were given a room with a window facing a wall and a bathtub not draining properly. Inefficient room service and overpriced poor quality breakfast is not what you expect when you pay a good price. If you are allergic to smoke stay away from the suffocating restaurant . location was ""relatively"" good and staff were ""relatively"" polite.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2013,5,Personification,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights before heading for a conference in Dakar, Senegal. It was this rare feeling that I had once I set foot in Le Doge. Air of elegance, amazing service, and personified interior design for the suite rooms. Second night I moved in to Hemingway's suite and I must say Le Doge simply knew how to translate into near perfection.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2013,5,Art Deco gem with all the comforts,"Beautiful Art Deco rooms and suites... each one different and uniquely styled basis prominent Art Deco designers/architects. The bathrooms are large and spacious and most have large marble baths... It's located very well in a beautiful Art Deco district in Casa and while it's tucked away in a small street, it's 15 mins walking from all the action in the city centre. The staff is very helpful and helped us with all transfers, great hotel recommendations etc. Breakfast is served in a cosy restaurant and the patisserie and spread is of excellent quality.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2013,5,Beautiful hotel in Casablanca,"We recently stayed at this wonderful hotel in Casablanca. Our flight from New York arrived at 6:25 AM, so we got to the hotel just after 8 AM. We were exhausted and the hotel manager made sure our room was ready for us. The rooms are beautiful and the service is great.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,5,proposal and wedding night,I have made my proposal to my wife on the garden roof of the hotel last June and we both came back for our wedding night (via a special wedding night deal offered by the hotel) on the 26th of October. The hotel will forever stay in our heart not only because of the two aforementioned events but also thanks to the staff who helped make them unforgettable.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,5,Fabulous hotel in Casablanca,"I loved our stay at Hotel & Spa Le Doge in Casablanca - the hotel is a lovely Art Deco, the suites are gorgeous and the hotel is very stylish.

Great experience and I highly recommend it.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2013,4,Chic Boutique hotel,Chic boutique hotel 1930s Art Deco. Lovely rooms with quality bedding and linen. Clean and spacious bathrooms. Each room features a celebrated liteary or artistic figure. Breakfast more than ample. Good French/Moroccan menu for dinner. Helpful and friendly staff.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,5,Fantastic Boutique hotel with good quiet location.,"Just back from Morocco and stayed here on two occasions. The staff were all extremely friendly, the food great, the rooms most excellent and the location nice and quiet for what can be a busy city. I was on a trip further south to Dakhla and had to overnight in Casablanca on both legs of my journey so decided after reading previous reviews to take a cab (organised by the hotel) into the city to sight see on the morning before my afternoon flight. It was a great idea. The vibe of this hotel is fantastic, each room having its own flair and very generous proportions with great high ceilings. Breakfast very good too. The location is tucked away off the main street so it is also nice and quiet at night and feels very safe too. A short stroll takes you down to the old Medina and…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,4,A boutique hotel nestled in the backstreets of Casablanca,"This hotel is tiny and bespoke, with only 16 - 18 rooms each of which is named after a legendary figure eg F Scott Fitzgerald, Somerset Maugham, Coco Chanel. It was built in the 30s so retains some lovely original period features, the higher two floors were added later. Room size was very generous as was the bathroom with an enormous fully marble-tiled bath (with rain head shower). Customer service is exemplary and the small, cosy dining room offered a choice of dinner options, if a little limited. However the breakfast which I had in my room, was huge....masses of fresh fruit, fresh juice, French pastries and rolls, dried fruits from the region, cheeses etc. It was enough for me to make lunch from as well. I walked around the area and could not see any other restaurants close…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2013,5,One of the best hotels ever,"We stayed at Le Doge at the start and finish of our tour of Morocco. It was excellent. The rooms were big, clean, and the service was first class. The dining room, and its attached library, on the first floor was an art deco glory. We ate in several times on both the roof, and the dining room. Both were first class. Could not fault the hotel.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2013,4,Good hotel but problems with staff at check in,This hotel is something special. It is a little bit old fashioned. It has a touch of beeing sophisticated. You can confirm it with old 5 star hotels in London. The hotel is a little bit hided. Without help it is difficult to find it. There is no parking space infront of the hotel. The hotel is only offering 16 rooms. Because of this you should expect an individual high class service. But on arrival you can see that normally there is only one person sitting at the desk and doing her phone calls. The guest has to wait and there is no welcome. I have had this experiences two times because I have stayed 2 times within one week in this hotel. The second visit was something special. The very unfriendly rude lady has asked me for my passport. I have answered that the hotel has noticed…,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2013,5,Outstanding Boutique Hotel and Restaurant,We stayed ay the Le Doge on our first night in Morocco. What an incredible introduction to hospitality and outstanding Moroccan food. The staff (everyone) is among the best I have ever experienced; the room was outstanding; and all staff were very attentive. We had dinner in the restaurant and found the service and food exceptional. This was my first time to have beef tajine -- awesome. This is a must stay place.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

From the minute we arrived yesterday, receiving a gorgeous mint tea, to the manageress ( not sure if this is her title) showing us how everything in the room worked,to a gorgeous pre dinner drink on the garden roof top everything was perfect. Delicious breakfast in exquisite Art Deco surroundings. best tip: check out the different themed rooms to find one that is really you. Our friends had Scott Fitzgerald and we had Colette, amazingly decorated and interesting. Large spacious rooms with lots of lounging areas. This hotel (and you can see we have stayed in a few!) my husband & I agreed is one of the most charming & comfortable. Love the feeli of boutique, not a lot of people.

 January 2013,3,"Fine place to stay, don't eat there","If you must stay in Casablanca at all (and try not to), Le Doge is a lovely quirky, clean upmarket hotel. The staff was excellent, recommended a terrific restaurant for lunch, the room and bathroom a decent size. It's definitely a 4-5 star place (we are in our 50s and travel often) but avoid the restaurant for dinner at all costs. The food was terrible, no other way to put it. Casablanca itself has very little to recommend for tourists... we had to stay a night due to flight schedules but avoid it if you can. If not, Le Doge is a lovely haven from the ugliness of the city.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2013,5,Beautiful Art Deco Hotel,"We planned out trip to Morocco flying in to Casablanca and flying out of Marrakech. Casblanca to be just an overnight stay. We chose Le Doge because of our excellent experiences with the Relais & Chateaux properties. They did not disappoint at all! We were met at the airport by their very courteous and friendly driver who had chilled water bottles and 2 saucerplates with dates and cookies for our ride to the hotel.We really loved the decor and architechture of the hotel. Check-in was conducted in one of their salons where we were served mint tea and cookies. Our room was the ""Coco Chanel"" Room, all the rooms are named and decorated in the style of 1920's celebrities.

 June 2013,5,Excellent decore and experience,"We changed to this hotel on return from our tour due to disappointment with one we stayed in earlier. When I reported that the wifi didn't work in our room, they immediately sent a technician who installed a temporary router. The themed room concept is great, but the drink prices in the bar were outlandish - the beer in the minibar were about half the price. Breakfast was a little disappointing with little choice.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2013,5,Worth it,"I said I was going to start writing TripAdvisor reviews since I use the site a lot, but now I've realised that I can't be bothered, because in this case, it's just going to be all gushing positivity. Everything was spot on: the room, free usage of the spa, rooftop garden and staff were all great. In fact, the staff were brilliant, not only while we were there, but when we rang ahead to switch the day we stayed. Le Doge is a little expensive, but then everywhere in Casablanca is, and this place is definitely worth the extra few quid.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2013,4,Art Deco Boutique Hotel in Casablanca,"Hotel Le Dodge is a small hotel however the bed rooms are rather large. Very personalized attention and we all felt safe, comfortable and content while we were there. The hotel can definitely use a renovation but it is nice (think, going to grandmother's house).",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2013,5,Outstanding Hotel - I would return just to be able to stay here again,"This hotel was a delight from the moment we arrived, hot and dusty from a plane, train and taxi trip. It is stunning - the pictures simply do not do it justice. It is an art deco treasure and the rooms, each distinct, ooze character without compromising on the comfort. Ours was delightful with a private terrace with table where we sat and had breakfast at 0400 hours in the morning. But what also marks this hotel out is the service. The manager and his team were utterly charming and always to hand. In fact at times it was a bit like an old movie whenever we stepped out of a lift or a door someone popped up from nowhere offering assistance. What completely took me aback was when they offered, at not additional cost, to serve us breakfast in our room at 0400hrs in the…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 April 2013,5,Perfect End to a Wonderful Trip!,"We spent the final night of our 10-day Morocco vacation at Le Doge and we're thrilled that we did! The service was impeccable from the moment we arrived. Along with a seamless checkin/out, they were very helpful in getting us dinner reservations, hiring cars, and very attentive with cocktails on the beautiful roof deck upon our arrival. Our room was perfect- a large bathroom with a HUGE tub and seperate shower. We had a small balcony and a tastefully decorated room. Our only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer! A MUST if ever in Casablanca!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2013,5,European elegance with Moroccan opulence. Perfect.,"We spent our last night in Morocco at Le Doge. Our stay was perfect. We received a warm welcome from Anna at the front desk. The manager, Laurand, showed us around and brought us to our beautiful room. After multiple opulent riads in Fes and Marakech the Le Doge was perfect. It was elegant in an entirely European way. Our junior suite was a tribute to Coco Chanel. The room was beautiful and the black and white bathroom with its claw foot tub was jaw dropping. The service was impeccable. Breakfast was great with both Moroccan and European items. Perfect for a romantic stay.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2013,5,Step back and meet Bogie and Bacall!,We arrived at midnight and left at 09.30 as we were on a schedule and would have dearly loved to stay longer. Stunning hotel!

 April 2013,3,Fawlty Towers?,"I had 3 days in the Hotel. It was ok but a long way short of the Relais and Chateaux standard we saw elsewhere in Morocco. Lots of staff everywhere, but I am unsure what they did. The manager on Day 1 told me there was very little to do in Casablanca - which is not what I expected to hear from the front desk of a city hotel. He said the meagre city plan they handed me was all they had, and really showed all there was to see in town, which was very wrong - but I had to work that out myself, with the help of a plan I was given in another hotel. Once something was used in your room, that was it.

 March 2013,5,Delightful Hotel in otherwise Mediocre City,"Cozy and quaint art deco hotel - we stayed there a total of three nights (one night in one room then after a few days in Marakesch two more nights on return back to Casablanca). Staff very nice, management very good and so was food- although more French/ than ""native"" Moroccan. Very nice breakfast buffet. Small but nice roof top garden too Only ""negative"" is the so-called exercise room. It is actually only four cardiovascular devices (i.e. treadmill, stationary bike etc in a semi-open area near hot pool so the temperature is a bit warm to work out in-",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2012,4,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for a couple nights before and after a road trip through Morocco, and we thought it was a great place to stay in Casablanca. It was in a nice area and we were able to walk to everything that we wanted to see, such as the Medina and the Grande Mosque. The rooms were large and clean, and I thought the themes were sweet. They had a small snack waiting in the room when we arrived, which was a nice touch. The rooftop patio is lovely and has a great view. We had lunch up there the first day we arrived and it was delicious. I would definitely stay here again if I went back to Casablanca.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2013,3,"nice hotel, so-so experience","Location was central. Hotel was nicely decorated. Food in the restaurant very French, which was nice after all the Moroccan food we had on our 12 day trip. Room was nice, bathroom huge, but not very clean. We only stayed for one night, so we were not bothered to complain so much. What i did complain about was the ""spa"" part. I had reserved online as a perfect finale to our Morocco trip. I chose the Oriental Program which is for 90 min for my husband and I. We were ushered into a steam room where we sat for 10 minutes while the room got warm. A girl came in and rubbed the special Moroccan soap on me, then I sat while rubbed it on my husband. Then she scrubbed it off with a little mitt that we got to keep. The whole thing took 30 minutes. We were then told we can use the steam…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 April 2013,5,Delightful art deco hotel,"We stayed only one nite but found everyone to be most helpful. We needed an early breakfast before leaving for airport and they were most accommodating. While we did not eat in restaurant, we had room service -- do not order croquet monsieur -- it has mystery meat. But the potatoes and shrimp cocktail were both excellent. They also brought us dessert treats which were lovely almond macaroon cookies. The décor is just fabulous and the rooms very large. We cannot comment on the neighborhood since we did not go out from the hotel by foot. The staff made us feel most welcomed and we would recommend them highly.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2013,4,Good with some down sides,"We areaaly liked the interior of the building. Service is good, our room was clean, elegantly decorated, spatious and with a lot of natural light. In the room there was a Bose Ipod dock. Some of the city landmarks, such as the former cathedral, the tribunal, United Nations Square and the Arab League park are just within walking distance. We did not like the gloomy corner of the neighborhood where the hotel stands, on narrow curvy street, often blocked by trucks and badly parked cars. The bathtub in our room was leaking water into the bathroom floor. In the room there is a Nespresso machine, but no instruction on how to use it (we knew, but still it took us a while to find out where the water filling should go), no milk and, of course, one could not prepare tea. I did not like…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 February 2013,4,The little tramp at home,"Tastefully, thematically appointed, we stayed in the Charlie Chaplin room. The little tramp would have been quite at home.

 February 2013,4,A Haven in an average Casablanca,"Adding a leisure trip on to the end of a work one in Rabat, we selected this hotel as our base from which to explore the city. It is an oasis. Superb rooms, roof terrace , hamam and drawing room. The service was excellent (although did get sent in the entirely wrong direction by the concierge which indirectly meant we missed the last tour of the mosque.. he even marked the hotel in the wrong place on the map!) We dined in the hotel one night and the food was good, the atmosphere relaxed, however the piano playing just a little too loud which made the odd bum note very obvious! Just added to the fun we had but we were pleased when he took a tea break. Would definitely recommend this if anyone found themselves in the city.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2013,4,The Lush Life,"Le Doge is everything you think of when you think boutique hotel. It's a one of a kind. It's artsy; it's jazzy - it's Lush. The rooms are the definition of well appointed. The attention to detail is remarkable. Nothing is quite the same, but all are quite exceptional in their own exceptional way. They are cozy and the beds are comfortable. Fall in love with a bathroom! My only complaint is that most of the rooms are masculine designed - not standard or boring by any means, but ""manly"", which I suppose is good for men who probably are tired of standard or frilly affairs. Just hope there's only one room available, so that you won't be taxed with the choice! You wouldn't think it, and you won't notice it initially, since its locale seems quite residential, but it's actually…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2013,5,A cozy riad in the heart of Casablanca,This was a wonderful find. We arrived late from a long day traveling form the US and even though the dinning room was closed the staff whipped us up a delicious snack that was more of a meal than snack. From this location we were able to walk to all the sights of Casablanca. Our room was like being at home with a fireplace and nice little private outdoor sitting area.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2012,4,Nothing Special,"After staying in Morocco for a couple of weeks this was our last hotel. We could not see why this hotel was rated five stars because the ambiance was nothing special after seeing and experiencing all the other exotic Riads and hotels in Morocco. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with this hotel but it was nothing special. Upon arrival we were greeted with a very small lobby which looked like an ordinarily house living room. Once we got up to our rooms it looked like we were staying somewhere similar to the Hilton. We just expected something with more of an exotic touch. The manager was very courteous and even went out of his way to show us to ou room and explain how all the gadgets and lights work. We also had to catch a flight very early in the morning and they…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2012,5,Great Boutique Hotel,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Doge in Casablanca. It is a small hotel with beautifully appointed rooms. The room and bathrooms were spacious. The shower was terrific with great pressure. Make sure you make reservations if you want to use the fitness room or the hot tub. We also loved the breakfast. If you are taking a taxi from the airport and your driver cannot find it, the Doge is around the corner from the Almohades Hotel.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2012,4,Art Deco lovlieness,"After driving round and around in circles we finally found this hotel which is down a very small side street. The staff were very helpful and as we had a hire car they were able to take that from us and park it, just as well as the parking on these small streets was impossible! The location is very convenient, we were able to walk to many of the major sites in Casablanca and it is right in the middle of the Art Deco district. We stayed in the Josephine Baker room, very nicely decorated and very clean. Really comfy, even if small double bed. We ate here one of our 3 nights and the food was delicious. Breakfast was also very good. The best part about this hotel is the architecture and interior design, really lovely.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2012,5,Elegant Art Deco tranquility,"This hotel was everything we wanted after a few weeks in West Africa, elegant, quiet, beautifully decorated and with wonderful service.

The staff were very helpful with reservations and taxis, and also purchased rail tickets to Fes for us. We would recommend it very highly.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2012,4,Peace & Quiet,"This is a lovely hotel to retreat to after a day out in Casablanca. The decor is fantastic and just what you would expect in the 1920's - ""Art Deco"" Style.

All in all a great place to spend a few days, don't forget to check out the roof terrace garden where you can have your drinks served.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2012,5,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed at this fantastic hotel for 2 nights at the beginning of our trip and 1 night at the end. We had different rooms for both of our stays and they were both very comfortable. The beds were cozy, room was large, clean and very beautiful. Bathrooms were also very clean and large. The service was outstanding. The breakfast buffet was also very nice. They have a very nice restaurant for dinner as well but it is very expensive. This is a great hotel to stay at. Enjoy.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2012,4,Lovely boutique hotel,The staff were very helpful. Sarah made some fantastic suggestions for dinner each night. Not just the touristy ones like Ricks. The rooms are very well appointed and all very different. There was a bit of chaos the first time where we were sent to the restaurant via taxi without directions. But we made it by calling the hotel. I would recommend for the non French speakers like myself you get clear indication on the map before leaving as taxi drivers are not always that knowledgeable. You could take the hotel taxi but it is ridiculously expensive. Petite taxi was 20 and hotel taxi was 200. I would recommend staying here it is actually very central between all the sights - within walking distance of most.,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2012,5,Wow!,"That pretty well sums up our stay in Casablanca at the Hotel & Spa Le Dodge Relais & Chateaux. Even before our arrival our contact with Amandine was great. Amandine arranged in advance for our dinner reservations at Rick's Café and obtained our train tickets for a trip to Marrakech. The tickets were waiting on the desk in our room when we arrived. All of the staff at the hotel were pleasant and attentive, but Amandine was outstanding in all respects. She was there watching over the breakfast in the morning, helpful throughout the day with our questions and needs and was still there to greet us when we returned from dinner.

But once found, it's actually one of the best things about Le Doge. It's really quiet which is crucial in the busy and noisy center of Casablanca. We slept wonderfully. It is very lovely, romantic. We chose the Josephine Baker room which we loved. The breakfast were succulent and very generous. We room had everything we need from safe, TV, air conditioning, espresso coffee maker. The service was excellent. Ah the legendary Moroccan hospitality. They gave us great advice. We loved the Rick's Cafe (think the movie Casablanca) where they made reservation for us. They secured the private free hammam/sauna/jacuzzi for us, which was wonderful after a full day walking around Casablanca. We…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The hotel was a bit hard to find and the taxi driver had to call for directions but other than that the hotel was great. I looked at a number of hotels before booking and Le Doge was by far the best! The hotel staff were wonderful, really helpful and friendly. We had dinner at Ricks Cafe which came recommended. Definitely a must if you are in Casablanca.

 September 2012,5,Attractive boutique hotel,"We stayed in this attractive and comfortable boutique hotel on the first two nights of a two and a half week visit to Morocco. Our room was comfortable, well fitted out and had excellent bath products provided. All the rooms are individually designed in a nostalgic art deco style, like the hotel itself.

We were so impressed by everyone's kindness and the hospitality was remarkable. Great restaurant with excellent service and food both at dinner and breakfast. The suite was clean, comfortable and had much character. The hotel is also very child friendly and our son found the lava cake in the restaurant the best dessert he ever had.

 June 2012,5,Wonderful manager,"We returned from a two week trip to Morocco last week. Our visit ended in Casablanca where we stayed at Le Doge for one night. It is a small boutique type hotel . The room was beautiful and the bathroom was spacious and luxurious . The manager could not have been more courteous and helpful. Our flight did not leave until 2am and he provided a room so that we did not have to wait in the lobby. The duck and chocolate desert were delicious . The staff were friendly and attentive. I have friends who are considering a trip to Morocco and I advised them to stay at Le Dodge. We stayed at other fabulous hotels (La Sultana , Palais Blue) and I enjoyed them.

 May 2012,3,Couldn't agree more with the previous review,Yes Le Doge is a fabulous building but with the exception of the front desk service fell well below my expectations. The waiting staff at breakfast as sullen. The poor service culminated on Saturday night when a neighbouring room had room service. The 'used' trolley was left on the landing outside my room and two and a half hours later when we returned from Rick's Cafe it was still there. I telephoned reception to get it removed and when it was still there ten minutes later my husband took it down in the lift and wheeled it into reception. What was meant to be the high light of our sort break in Morocco failed to deliver. Simply not good enough for a hotel of this standing,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2012,3,Disappointed; possibly over-expectant?,"I have mixed feelings about my stay. Overall I left Le Doge on the disappointed side, but that may have been as a result of having too-high expectations after reading the previous reviews. That said, the service (on a Sunday) was not to the standard one would expect here. The place is basically gorgeous. Set in a quiet side street, one enters a beautifully furnished and finished oasis; all the areas are lovely. My room, on the third floor was on the small side but again beautifully furnished. The window looked straight into a white wall but that made for quiet! I would have liked to have been asked if I wanted my bags taken care of (normally I carry them myself).

 April 2012,5,A beautiful jewel of a hotel in Casablanca,"My husband and I were in Casablanca for one night and decided to treat ourselves to a stay at a hotel that was part of the Relais & Chateaux chain. Although it was difficult to find, even with our Moroccan driver's GPS, from the moment we entered, we felt thoroughly pampered. This hotel was a small yet luxurious oasis in the middle of a bustling city. It was very elegant and quiet, while the city was extremely cosmopolitan and traffic-filled. The service was impeccable and the staff was there to meet our every need. We both had a good massage in the spa that was very relaxing at the end of our 12-day Moroccan adventure- a perfect way to end the trip.

We knew we would be tired from the overnight flight through Paris, so we wanted to stay in a nice place in Casablanca. We chose Le Doge because it looked interesting and had an excellent location. Le Doge turned out to be a wonderful choice. The rooms are superbly appointed and very comfortable—each room has a theme, but the themes do not get in the way of the highest comfort, quality and service. The breakfast was superb. The rooftop terrace was a beautiful introduction to Casablanca. We were able to walk to the markets, the medina and the ocean from the hotel with little difficulty.

While the themed rooms were in themselves unique and luxuriously well-appointed in every detail, the best part of our experience was the personalized service. All the way from Directeur Laurent Delord who personally welcomed us during check-in to the Bell person who even drove us to and from a restaurant. Kudos to other staffers such as Latif at the restaurant and Latifa the guest manager. Bravo too to the chef and the restaurant which surprisingly had excellent food for such a small operation.

It was a totally different experience from staying at a large corporate hotel. This was more like a bed and breakfast. Each room is named after a famous writer/poet and is decorated accordingly. The staff was super attentive and the general manager knows the true meaning of hospitality, from greeting you when you arrive to biding you farewell when you leave. The bed and pillows were so comfortable!!! And the room had been prepared with multiple personal touches. Although I wasn't able to enjoy the spa, I did go to the gym. That was the one disappointment at this hotel. There were only three machines and it was very hot in there due to the covered pool being in the same area.

The hotel's entrance is pleasantly upmarket, and the door staff were great and very friendly, as all the staff. This level of service extended everywhere inside the hotel, too - from check in to bar staff. My room was small but had been very well thought-through and finished, and the decoration was perfect.

 February 2012,2,All Show Don't Go,"My girlfriend and I recently spent the final night of our ten day trip to Morocco at Le Doge. Overall, we were very disappointed with our stay. The only positive note was that we were booked into the Coco Chanel Room at a discounted rate. The room was well appointed and clean, but practical matters like having no shower curtain around the tub with a large shower-head that sprayed water everywhere and flooded the floor, is in my mind, a gross oversight and signifcant drawback to a comfortable stay. However, when I did ask for more towels to dry the floor, they were readily supplied to our room.

A receptionist who couldn't identify the hotel location on the hotel provided map, another receptionist lounging behind the reception desk sending text messages ignoring guests, is this really a Relais & Chateux.? The room was okay nothing exceptional, the furnishings were starting to look tired particularly the desk in our room which was chipped and scratched like something you might find in Motel 6. I am sure there are better options in Casablanca.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2012,5,A delightful small hotel,"This hotel is quite small but the service is excellent. The staff went out of their way to be helpful. The rooms are beautifully decorated in the style of the art deco period. There is a spa and ham am, but it is small but service is excellent so if you want a massage and/ or scrub, be sure to book. There is good in house food service and at least two good restaurants within a two block walk GastroNom and the Moroccan Restauant in Riad Zitoun. On ly downside is that it is a little bit of a walk to the centre of town, but it is a pleasant walk, and the hotel has two cars available to drive you if you wish. You can get back fom almost anywhere by mini-cab for 10-15 Dh (<$2), although in the evenings prices may be a little higher.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2012,5,Wonderful oasis of luxury,"We had a wonderful time at Le Doge, staying over New Year’s. It is conveniently located near the medina of Casablanca. Le Doge, originially an Art Deco Villa built in the 1930s, was an oasis of luxury to which we happily returned each evening after an intense day out and about in the city. All the rooms are beautiful, each styled with an individual theme inspired by a writer or artist from the Art Deco era, such as Josephine Baker and Scott Fitzgerald. We stayed in the Coco Chanel, which we loved so much that requested it again when we returned two weeks later. What made the stay special was the friendliness of the staff, including Mouazzine and Sanaa, and especially the kind help we received from the manager Laurent Delord, who helped us considerably by facilitating with all…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2011,5,Boutique + Casablanca = Perfect Combo,"One of the most charming things we loved about Casablanca was the architecture and style. Le Doge is able to create the same through in this special little gem of a hotel. Uniquely designed rooms, very personal attention, and a level of care / concern of its guests that I haven't seen for years. The team at Le Doge took extremely good care of us. Having dinner waiting after a (very) late arrival to a personalized tour of the city in their hotel car ... it really as a surprise and special pleasure to stay. Would definitely recommend the hotel and we will definitely be back.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2011,5,The Best Hotel Ever!!,"Dear Laurent (General Manager) and the Wonderful team at Le Doge; Casablanca, Thanks a million for making our time an ‘unforgettable’ one in Casablanca! Your hotel is truly a heaven with its tranquillity, elegance and fantastic interiors and not to mention the intriguing history behind the building! Our Room; it was cleaned everyday with the upmost care and individuality and perfection – the girls were so courteous every time they greeted us!

 December 2011,4,"6 out 10 , average","A nice hotel , rooms are too small though , service is slow , staff is not multilingual. BUt overall experience is ok , too expensive though , i would get better for my dime elsewhere.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2011,5,Really a gem,"This really is an extraordinary little find. The clerk tells me all 16 rooms are different, and I hope to work my way through them on future connections. I will stay here again, so I really should give it one star and try to drive away you folks that might fill it up. But I'm too honest. Nice breakfast, nicely appointed room including, of all things, a remote control for all the lights (I want one of these at home) and a Bose sounddock for iThings. And, of course, just a nicely appointed little boutique kind of style. The staff is very helpful and accommodating.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2011,5,Great hotel in Casablanca!,"My wife and I, along with another couple, were treated to a wonderful night stay at the hotel. It was great to be greeted with a smile and great service which they are working on. As one of the bellman said to me, ""whatever you need to let me know, "" and they really appear to mean it. The room was excellent and the dinner/breakfast in the restaurant very enjoyable. quiet, clean, and comfortable.....all for a great stay before flying out. We recommend it if you are looking for an excellent hotel in the city.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2011,5,Luxurious boutique hotel!,"Hotel and Spa Le Doge richly deserves it's #1 ranking on TripAdvisor! My partner and I have also stayed at the Hyatt in Casablanca, and there's really no comparison between the two - for personal service, a terrific spa, a great restaurant, and beautifully designed rooms, Le Doge is the best. We enjoyed the restaurant for a very reasonably priced gourmet dinner, one of the very best we've had in all of Morocco, and my partner told me that the spa's hammam, sauna, and jacuzzi were also fantastic, and they are all complimentary! The service at all times is pleasant, efficient, and very friendly. This is a terrific hotel; don't miss it if you are traveling to Casablanca!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2011,5,Top class service,Le Doge is an exceptional hotel in Casablanca differentiated with its top quality service and staff. We had few hours in Casa and walked in to have breakfast and use SPA. All of the staff in the hotel did everything to make us feel home. Truly exceptional.. We will definitely come back!,Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2011,5,The best hotel I´ve ever stayed!,"I spent 3 nights at this hotel and it is fantastic! Nor even Ritz-Carlton has so nice service and comfort. The art deco is very nice and all the furnitures and bath equipments are top class. The SPA is fabulous...it is super exclusive that when you book certain period, you will be alone. Hammam, sauna and the jacuzzi are very good and the massage espectacular! The staff is very kind and patient, though language was a difficult barrier. But since I was not in a rush or stressed, I didn´t mind. The breakfast is good. Fresh bread basket and a small buffet. You don´t have many options, but for me it was enough. Hot things include scramble eggs (you can order any other type), baked potatoes, bacon, tomato). Fruits, corn flakes, cheese, ham etc are also in the breakfast. Room is very…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2011,5,Great Luxury Hotel,"The Doge is a really fresh, nice and new place to stay. very calm, with all-diferent themed rooms/suites wich have the names of many famous people (mine was Scott Fizgerald). Is a little bit expensive, and is not so easy to find a taxi that knows where it is. You can require the hotel's driver to take you fast to anywhere. at the evenings you can enjoy a piano player at the bar. Wi-fi is provided for free with a great speed connection. Definitively the best hotel in Casablanca!",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2011,4,Hidden Gem,"I spent a week in Le Doge.... The hotel is very charming , Art Deco theme which fits with the history of Casablanca. Each room has a unique theme,in a quiet and respectful area. The service is personal, the staff are very attentive and friendly. The roof terrace overlooking the Casa skyline, and the spa is small but does the job. If your looking to unwind or have quiet drink listening to Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole, the bar is one Casablanca's best kept secrets. Fahmi",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2011,5,Outstanding service and hospitality,"We recently enjoyed one night in Casablanca before catching our return flight home following a marvelous family vacation in Morocco. While Casablanca is not usually a tourist destination, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. It is a 15 minute walk to the medina, but be careful when you cross the street! The property's claim to fame is the unique design of each room, each one a tribute to a different art deco artist. However, the truly outstanding feature of this hotel is the superb service and hospitality. The hotel manager greeted us in person and with her entourage gave us a tour of the facility. For a reasonable service charge, the hotel's private driver took us to and from a seaside restaurant for dinner in a 4-passenger luxury sedan. If you don't mind not having a…",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2011,5,Dancing with an Original,"Hotel Le Doge is a lovely boutique hotel located on a quiet side street in Casablanca's Art Deco district. Rooms are individually named and decorated in tribute to a different artist of the era. I was in the Josephine Baker room, a confection of pink and black. Rooms feature en-suite facilities with both a tub and shower and lovely amenities. The hotel has a restaurant, salon/library, and spa. Much of original stained glass adorns this gorgeous property. Unfortunately I could only enjoy one delightful night at this hotel before heading on to Rabat.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2011,4,Secluded and very good!,"Very comfortable room and nicely decorated- I think all the rooms are themed which adds to the ambience-felt almost like home. Arrived at the property after 30 hours flying and had no trouble sleeping. However I did manage to flood the shower as the waste discharge was blocked. This was remedied quickly and efficiently by hotel staff. Room service was good, reasonably priced and promptly served. Would stay here again for sure. Very pleasant helpful staff.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2010,5,I have a house in Casablanca,"This hotel is perfect. I strongly reccomend to those who are picky and need comfort in their hotels. The hotel is small, but very tastefully decorated. The personnel is very friendly and proffecional. They do anything to make you feel comfortable. The rate is worth every dime. Their driver takes you through the city when available. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. I feel like I have a house waiting for me in Casablanca.",Hotel_Le_Doge-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
