 October 2021,5,Stay here!,"Our stay at Riad Ibn Khaldoun was amazing. I highly recommend that if you are going to Fes that you stay here. The owner, Lasrac, greeted us with such kindness and made us feel like home. The rest of the staff was so wonderful too. We had a traditional Moroccan breakfast and it was extremely fresh. The owner set us up with a tour guide and that went well too. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The water was hot and had great water pressure. I, without a doubt, will stay in this Riad next time I am in Fes. They all worked around the clock to care for us.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2019,5,Best Riad experience in Morocco,"This was by far our favorite riad from our trip to Morocco. The architecture was absolutely stunning, and the staff took excellent care of us. Someone kindly walked to help us unload our suitcases from our car, and then rode with my husband to direct him to the local parking lot. We had a fabulous dinner at the riad with mouthwatering dishes. They also kept us well supplied with tea, and served us delicious mint tea several times through our stay. We will definitely be back if we are ever in Morocco. We can 100% recommend this hotel.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2019,5,Everything perfect!,"We had dinner at the restaurant and everything was great. We asked for a vegetarian menu and a riad menu, one with soup and the other one with moroccan salad. The flavours were just perfect, the salad was huge and I was already full by then. And the place is so beautiful, with typical decoration. Omar hospitality made us feel really good and confortable. He was so kind and attentive all the time! We wanted a moroccan dinner and we had it, perfect! Thank you so much!",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2019,5,"Nice riad, awesome team.","Beatifull riad. Even if not renting a room there the restaurant has incredible decor and even better food, totally worth the stop! 5* for Omar who works there and was very helpful, kind and made everything perfect!",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2019,4,"Beautiful Riad, great staff","The Riad was very beautiful and in a convenient location (just outside the medina gate, so you can take a taxi there). All the staff was very helpful. They had a great rooftop where you could see a beautiful view of the city. What we didn't like though was our room on the 3rd floor because there are just too many steps to climb up (and steps are steep and narrow, so it was hard to walk). Also, they messed up with our transport booking and we were left hanging at the train station (they sent an email to correct it but it was last minute). All in all, confirm and confirm again and try to avoid the room on the top floor and you would enjoy yours stay.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2019,5,A place that makes you feel at home,"This beautiful Riad breathes Marocco's hospitality. Dilligent and above all super friendly staff made our stay (4 nights) a real treat. The stairs are bad news if you have trouble climbing them, but the rest easily makes up for it. Beautiful view from roof terrace, gorgeous building itself. If you want luxury, go somewhere else. If you prefer true hospitality, great food (I recommend harira!), good beds in AC-room, everything clean and well kept, nicest staff you'll ever meet (all of them, not just the omnipresent showcase of true friendliness and professinalism Omar) - stay here!. If you stay just one night, you'll sell yourself short. It takes a little time to soak it all in. If we return to Fes, we will certainly book here.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2019,5,"Local Riad, nice building and service","On our 5-day tour with Navette For You, one night stay in this Riad was included when we visited Fez. This Riad IBN Khaldoun was built in 1373 by a philosopher named Khaldoun. This building is traditional Moroccan. There are at least 4 floors ( I am not certain as the second floor seems to only be a pathway). There is no elevator, only narrow staircases. So travel light!! We had a nice big room off the ground floor, which can accommodate 4 people. When we checked in, there were also other parties checking in. We filled out the paperwork and got into our room. Then we were told we did not complete the check in process, we were invited out for Moroccan Tea, that was part of the welcoming process. They seemed to a little short handed. Our attendant, Omar, was very…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2019,5,A magical and colourful Riad,"Upon entering the Riad from the dingy alley way it was like a magical wonderland. The doors opened to what felt like a museum or palace. The attention to detail of the amazing decorations was just WOW!! The staff, especially Hamza, were helpful, cheeky, cheerful and assisted in directions and answering any questions I had. I felt most welcomed. And also the manager Mourad helped with onward travel which I was greatful for. The breakfast was better than most riads I stayed in with breads, croissant, fresh fruit, omelette and lovely coffee. The rooms were comfortable, clean and my first room was fit for a queen.. they must have known I was coming!! For the price I would say this riad is up there with the best of them. Don’t look any further and come and enjoy what felt…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2019,5,Lovely riad,"The breakfast was delicious and very complete, and the staff was very kind and friendly as they helped us at all times. The riad is located in a dead end street near a very crowded avenue, so we felt safe at all times. I would highly recommend this riad to anybody who wants to visit Fes.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2019,4,Great place to stay,"Huge rooms, clean, the AC was magnificent, very well decorated, very helpful staff, bathroom was clean and effective, but fixtures looked a little cheap. Didn't really matter - they functioned fine. Stairs are quite steep so if you struggle with mobility, might not be the place for you - but I think that's the case with a lot of Riads. I'd certainly go back.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2019,5,Amazing experience,"The Riad Ibn Khaldoun is just amazing and when you go inside, you will have a sensation, as if you enter a magical world, a atmosphere of a thousand and one nights. The hall is stunning, the room was cozy and furnished in real Moroccan style, the bed was very large and comfortable. The terrace with wonderful sight above Medina, the Moroccan breakfast was rich and fresh, the guys of the staff are very very kind and helpful with every needs, especially Hamid who asked me always if everything was ok. The Riad is near the Medina.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2019,5,Very good service,"The rooms are really nice and authentic, the staff so very helpful, the location good (though the hot location is near the other gate of the Medina, the blue gate.) Everything perfect though! As a restaurant, it is quite mediocre.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2019,5,Riad Ibn Khaldoun Hotel Recomended,"Riad Ibn Khaldoun Hotel have a very beautiful Classic Islamic decoration. The location of Ibn Khaldoun Hotel is very accessible by foot to the main attractions, the markets, all the beauty of Old Madina, It is just two minutes walk from the Blue Gate and the old medina. Hotel are vey clean. The staff, Sanna , Mohamad and Hamid are very kind people, they were very friendly and helpful , speaks French , English and Arabic. They suggested a great tour guide, made suggestions on what to visit. They speak with taxi if you lose your way. Several times during the evening, they served us Moroccan green tea without charges. It has a very nice terrace over the looking the old Medina. Internet connection was very fast. We will go back to them if we travel to Fes again.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,Lovely Riad!,"We stayed in this Riad for two nights. On entering the Riad we were welcomed and offered some mint tea. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. After our tea, we were shown to our room (Suite Iman). The room itself was huge and very authentic. The air conditioning was good and the room was cleaned everyday during our stay. The breakfast was excellent and beautifully presented. The roof terrace looks over the Médina so has pretty nice views. The riad is about a five minute walk from the medina and we were offered a guide which we declined, however the staff gave us a map. The only negative I can think of is that the riad is down an alley which is pretty dark however it is well signposted. I would recommend staying in Riad Khaldoun.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,3,Overrated but ok,We certainly did not see where the 9.1 rate is coming from. It is pretty to look at at first sight but really nothing special compared to other Riads we stayed in. Karim was great! He really made an effort to make our trip nice. But the room we stayed in (Suite Iman) did not have a window and was just at the lobby. We could here everything going on. Also there was no way to air out the room/toilet. The whole riad smelled a little weird which could easily be solved with some sentence oil. It was also dirty. I leaned with my head on a wall while sitting on a couch....my hair got stuck because it was sl sticky and I had to wash dem again. That was gross. Food was good but not the best we had in Morocco. But since we stayed in Ourika we are a little spoiled. So compardd to other…,Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2018,5,"Lovely, comfortable, safe, very helpful staff","This is my first visit to Morocco, and my niece and I are traveling alone. Fez is a bustling, exciting and interesting city, but it’s a lot to take in. We found a wonderful refuge in this beautiful riad: it’s cool, calm, and the staff have been so kind to us. Our room is on one of the upper floors, near the terrace. Ah, the terrace—stunning views of the city! We did not want to walk in the city at night, and so we spent the evening watching the city from the rooftop, listening to the calls to prayer from the mosques and enjoying the sunset over the ancient city. Our room is very large and air-conditioned. It is a walk up the steep narrow stairs but worth it (there are lower level rooms, though.) The staff carried our heavy bags up the stairs for us, helped us set up a guided…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2018,5,Gem in the Medinan Streets of Fes,"After a guide meets you outside the Medina, it is short walk to the Riad Ibn Khaldoun. Behind a gate and the typical Moroccan wooden door awaits a beautiful oasis from the hustle, bustle, and heat of Fes. Not only is the interior beautiful, but the staff is all incredibly warm and welcoming. They immediately offer tea and cookies and have a staff member go over the map of Fes as well as offering the services they can help arrange. I definitely recommend taking them up on the offer of a guide through the Medina, especially if you have never been to Fes before as it can be quite confusing. The breakfast is traditional Moroccan-ware, meaning various types of bread. However, you will find similar or worse anywhere else. All in all, I can fully recommend this property and have…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,5,Impressively beautiful!,"The riad is of a rare beauty: it is an old Dar with amazing zelij, high ceilings, wooden decoration, spacious rooms, clean and atmospheric, wonderful! The staff is friendly and ready to help you at any moment. The breakfast is correct but not something special. We appreciated our stay there in early April 2018. I recommend it mainly because of the grace of the building, it is of a stunning beauty!",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,4,Beautiful and honest,"Stayed here for the last couple of days. This place is beautiful, staff is very attentive and service is impeccable.

 September 2017,3,beautiful riad in good location,"after having read what people wrote about that Riad before, we had high expectation but weren't disappointed: it was probably the most beautful Riad we saw on our trip, with very nice rooms and a great roof top terrace to overlook the old town of Fes! staff is very nice and helpful (one thing we didn't like is that we were told that a tour guide is necessary in the old town although you will be able to see the city on your own too!). unfortunately we had problems with bugs but they took good care of it and gave us another room immediately. very good value regarding the price of the room too. if you come by car, note that there is a parking lot (20dh/day) right at the entry of the town (10 mins walking). don't let ""guides"" help you find your way (they will probably follow you on…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 September 2017,4,Great Location & friendly staff,"We stayed 2 nights in this Riad and it was good. The location is excellent. It is right outside of the Medina, and only a 1 minute walk from the road. Also there are cafes & shops close by. The staff is super friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was really good. The only critique I have is that the room was very small, we were three adults, and there was hardly any room to put our luggage and move around. Other than that, its a good place to stay while visiting Fez.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2017,3,Just Average,"Before staying at this Riad we had also stayed at Riads in Rabat and Chefchouen. Using these other Riads as a benchmark this Riad is ""Just Average."" The Positives: - The Riad is beautiful. From the moment you walk in to the main foyer you will see it's beauty. Likewise the rooms are beautifully appointed with 4 poster beds and stained glass windows. - Like all Riads the staff here are very friendly and helpful. English was not as good as others however this did not prove to be much of a problem. - Rooms are air conditioned and despite the rooms being large the air conditioning unit has no problem cooling them down. - The dinner was great although substantially more expensive (see negatives below) - The location on the outskirts of the medina is great. It means you can…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2017,3,Good Riad Option,"Like a true riad, this looks very unassuming on the outside, but the inside of it is a well designed Moorish interior, comfortably cool and quiet refuge away from the chaos of Fes. Having come in the middle of summer, the interior atrium of the place offered good respite from the heat outside. The detail of the decor is exquisite in lobby with antiques adorning walls. A welcome tea on arrival and check-in was a nice easy process. Being a solo traveller, my room was quite basic, but still comfortable enough for me to relax in. It was spacious enough, with a sofa and double bed. My views were looking out over the houses in the neighbourhood. A beautifully cool air conditioner in the room worked like a charm. The Moorish decor is continued inside the room and bathroom, although…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 July 2017,5,Affordable Luxury,This was the third destination on our honeymoon. We were astounded at the size of the room and the high ceiling and felt like royalty. We stayed here for two nights. The air conditioning was super powerful. We weren't expecting it to cool such a big room but it was more than sufficient. The bed was comfy. The breakfast was amazing and we also ordered food one night which tasted lovely. Staff were helpful.,Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 February 2017,5,What a great stay,"This is an aesthetically beautiful Riad in the médina and it's easy to get to. The rooms are well appointed, gorgeous and comfortable and gave us great sleeps. The pricing is ridiculously low! The staff, Jala, Brahim, and the manager, Abdul, cannot be more helpful although they try. The food is well prepared and extremely tasty and the kitchen staff go out of their way to satisfy their guests. Fatima, the chef, is very good. We can't recommend this Riad highly enough.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,4,Great Experience,"First trip to Morocco- arrived at 6:00 am after traveling all night. We were met by Ibrahim and guided a short way to the Riad through dark, dingy, streets but were very pleasantly surprised when we entered- even more so by our huge room. The Riad was beautifully refurbished in the traditional Moroccan style with beautiful tile, metal , and woodwork. The service and the kindness of the staff was much appreciated]- from Ibrahim to Abdul and especially Raja who went to great lengths to help us with information, guidance and directions during our 5 day stay. In the end the location was excellent- just within the Medina and walking distance to the souks but also easy to get taxis etc without having to walk through the myriad of small streets. We especially loved the dinners…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 June 2016,1,AVOID: Scammer's paradise,"Abdul, the road manager, is a complete scam artist and a difficult person to work with. First of all, he charged us twice for our stay and he is completely avoiding us to correct this issue. Secondly, he treats his staff terribly. He often barked at his staff (who were lovely and accommodating btw) to say how high when he said jump. Very sad. Overall, we have been scarred by this experience and it has completely dampened our experience in Fes.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2016,5,Beautiful Riad!!,"We were kindly booked at this riad within minutes as we had some problems at an other Riad. This place is literally a hidden gem tucked away just off a main road in the medina of Fes with a few minute walk to the souks. The courtyard is beautiful with detailed tiles and plenty of seating. The terrace is breathtaking with a view of the city, sun loungers and table and chairs. Our bedroom was sensational, with a massive four post bed, a dressing table, coffee table and chairs, fridge and en suite. The air condition was amazing! so powerful! we had stayed in quite a few riads on our holiday in Morocco and this was the best, super clean, extremely helpful, kind host and staff.

 May 2016,5,Elegant Riad and Accommodating Hosts,"My friend Meredith and I ended up at Riad Ibn Khaldoun in early May after the Riad we had booked (Riad Louna, booked through Airbnb) ""had a problem"" with our booking and tried to give us a room that was wayyyyy substandard to the one we had paid for. It was not a great start to our short stay in Fes, but once the whole thing had been ""sorted"" and we were brought to the somehow associated Riad Ibn Khaldoun, things turned around. We were given one of the stunning main suites, and felt immediately welcomed by our new host Abdul. Also on staff was a man named Ibrahim who was kind and very very funny and we absolutely adored.

 March 2016,4,Beautiful Riad,"The Hotel itself is an amazing building, with great tiles and decoration with huge rooms and a very tasty breakfast and a beautiful terrace. Unfortunately it is in a very narrow dark back street, which makes it at night a little scary for 2 ladies, and it has no lift, so it was a little difficult for my mum to went up the 3 floors.

 January 2016,4,nice riad wih great potential. Staff need to get their act together,"We booked this place on line and it seemed a very beautiful building. The place did not disappoint and it was indeed a very impressive old Riad which had been converted to a small hotel. Unfortunately while we were there, there was a change of hotel management and the old staff left to be replaced by a completely new team who did not know what was going on. They are still getting to grips with operating the place and small problems kept arising e.g. they missed cleaning our rooms one day and some guests were locked into the Riad as the manager left with the front door key.

Beautifully decorated - we had a lovely, large bedroom with four poster bed. Felt like being in a royal palace. Meals on the roof garden with exceptional views over Fez medina.

 March 2015,4,Lovely Riad with first class and friendly service close to Medina,"This Riad is tucked away down a couple of alleyways, about 5 minutes walk from the main Medina. We arrived at about 9.30 pm by car and were virtually accosted by various people on the street offering us ""help"" to find the place. If you accept their help, give them about 10-20 dirhams (approx 70 pence to £1.50). It's awkward to spot the alleyway which is clearly marked by a sign ""Riyad Ibn Khaldoun"" as the sign obscured by a tree. Anyway, when the door of the Riad opened, we were warmly greeted by our hosts and offered mint tea.

 October 2014,3,Meh... Not impressed,Our tour company booked a senior suite for us but we got a standard room when we arrived because we wanted separate twin beds. The standard room was on the rooftop and smelled very musky. I complained and they were slightly hesitating on giving us a better room by saying there are no other rooms ready. We told them we can wait for them to clean one and finally they agreed. We got them to do our laundry. It was pretty expensive (about$20 for a bag) and I realized I lost a garment afterwards. I'm not 100% sure if they lost it or if I left it behind but I'm usually good with packing my stuff. We did barter with them for a discount.

 March 2014,5,A taste of Morocco and a marvelous memory by itself,"We stayed two nights in this Riad in Fes. When first taken through the dark maze of corridors to the main door, we were a bit apprehensive. The doors opened and we were greeted with a spectacular ambiance of beautiful hand engraved plaster, hand carved and painted ceilings, a three story entrance hall and spotlessly clean. Our hosts, Tayeb and Achmed, could not have tried harder to make us feel welcomed. We were served a four course dinner on the roof terrace overlooking the town and being basked by a full moon. We had delightful breakfasts. Our hosts went out of their way to make sure that all questions were answered and would make suggestions for day and evening excursions. We felt the friendliness was sincere and greatly appreciated. Out bedroom was comfortable and the…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The view from the roof is amazing and not to be missed. We enjoyed our breakfast up there soaking in the sunlight and wonderful views. They also set us up for a tour with Lazrak-- highly recommended! He is very knowledgeable and funny. He showed us all the beauty Fes has to offer and really cared about showing us what we were interested in.

A central court that all rooms open off of and that soars up 3-4 flights, it is filled with Moroccan furnishings and you feel like you've stepped back in time. You will enjoy studying the fabulous architecture and furnishings. We were greeted by our host and served Moroccan tea and given an overview of what's available and the tour that can be provided. We were hoping to just spend a day roaming the pathways of the medina and he gave us exactly that, with loads of fascinating facts and showing us hidden sights we'd never have found on our own.

 December 2013,4,Traditional and good location,"If you want to experience Morocco in a more traditional way, Riads are made for you. This one is located very close to a parking and so, allows you to be in the medina, without having to walk too long with your luggages in the streets. Also, the owner, as friendly as his staff, has kept its traditional flair and the view from the terrace is wonderful! Rooms are also very well heated, which is a plus in winter.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 February 2013,5,Highly Recommended,"We chose Riad Ibn Khaldoun without realising what we were to expect and found an amazing place to stay in Fez close to the Ancient Medina.The warm welcome from the hospitality team - Karim,Rajaa,Ouafaa and Abderaham was fantastic as was their kindness and service throughout our five night stay in lovely traditional surroundings which provide a truly authentic feeling of times past. The proprietor, Mr. Lazrak Salaheddin introduced himself on our first night when we enjoyed a delicious Tagine and other delicacies and with him being so involved in the tourism industry,he gave us much interesting historical and current information. We had a simply wonderful time in this Riad which we can thoroughly recommend without hesitation as both he and his team will do everything to make your…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2013,3,It is ok,"The best tajine ever !!!! Everybody who is in Fes should go to have dinner there and order the tajine !!! The room is fine and bathroom is ok. The terrace is very dury and lot of stuff but a nice view, it is in the medina so for turist is perfect.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,2,Mangelhaft,Good location but not easy to find. The rooms ate clean but very dark. the bathroom is not to recommend and the terasse is full with waste. The breakfast is ok but you get 1 jam and traditional bread. No fruits ore some traditional food.,Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2012,4,Lovely Spot!,"This Riad has a great location, lovely roof top sitting area (but was too cold for us to use in March). Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Rooms were very clean and beautifully decorated. A nice Moroccan experience.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,Excellent home cooked Moroccan Food,"My family had an excellent Moroccan meal. It's home cooking at it's best. The quality of the food was first class and the ingredients so fresh. The soup was thick and flavoursome, and the lamb tagine definitely the best of our entire trip! The ambience was equally super. To end it all, our Super host - Mr Salaheddine Lazrak soaked us in Classic Moroccan culture including dressing up in full Traditional Moroccan clothes. Most memorable indeed. This is a Must for All looking for a super night out! -KOOparty",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2011,5,Very cultural-beautiful high ceilings/peaceful environment,"When I was looking for a unique Moroccan experience for lodging, I somehow came across this Riad. I wanted to stay somewhere with original tile work and history and feel like we were in a palace type room. We booked the Iman suite (about 125 euro, which is more than I usually spend, but felt it was part of the moroccan experience). Just to sit in the cultural hall of this Riad is amazing. The roof goes up so high and the beautiful, intrinsic tile work is really spectacular. The Riad is quiet and very peaceful, which helps in a chaotic place like Fes. You are in a great part of the Medina, the Andalusian quarter which has great winding alleyways, cute little shops and lots of history. One can also reach the outside entrance very quickly 1-2 minutes from this Riad, which is…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2011,5,WOW,"We booked a tour using Authentic Morocco and they asked ""did we wish basic, but nice or luxury"" as an accommodation option, we chose the former. Well if this is basic then I can only dream of what luxury must be like. On arrivial we were greated by Bilal and escorted up a dank & questionable passage way. What have we done?? echoes in my mind. On entering our abode, for the next 3 nights, we are ""gobsmacked"" & astounded at what a lovely place we have been presented. The roof top terrance provides a view over the old medina, where we will immerse ourselves. We have organised a private tour of the old medina & even our guide , for the day (he hasn't been inside this riad before) states he is amazed on how nice the place is. On our last evening, our host, organises a ""dress up"" in…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes

What an unforgettable hospitality!!! He made us feel at home!! The riad is charming, very beautiful, very clean too!! extremely well located for a visit to the medina!! Do not hesitate to stay in Riad Ibn Khaldoun as you won't be disappointed!!",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2011,5,It's Like Staying with a Family,"I stayed five nights at this beautiful riad conveniently located right on the edge of the medina (near the food markets). I was traveling solo and they took very good care of me, arranging a driver from the airport, a female guide (Farida Chaaibi, excellent!) to show me the sights, and even took me to the neighborhood hammam which is something tourists rarely see! Bilale and the rest of the staff speak perfect English and French, and were like family to me by the end of my stay. The food is delicious, make sure to book at least one dinner with them. I had a suite (even though I booked a single, there were empty rooms since it was low season) with cable TV (at least four movie and TV series channels in English) and a very good heater (in the winter, it may be mild in the…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2010,4,Quiet among the chaos!,"We arrived around 11pm at the Riad after taking a ferry from Tarifa, Spain and then a 5 hour train from Angier to Fes. So we were very please that the two nightes we stayd at Riad Ibn Khaldoun was just was we expect - quiet after all the Chaos that day. We were greeted with the traditional sugared mint tea. Checkin was efficient and Bahil was very friendly. The steps are very steep and I was happy that Bahil graciously carried my bag. We stayed on the 2nd floor - my husband and I in the ""honeymoon"" room and our two teenage children on the opposite side. The kids room had 3 twin size beds and a large bathroom so they were very comfortable. The second night we had dinner in the Riad and I would definitely recommend the food. It was a fixed menu and we were served bread,…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2010,5,unforgettable experience at Ibn Khaldoun,"Little did we know, when O and I decided to go to Fes, that we would end up in such an amazing riad. Our mouths dropped as soon as we walked in (the exterior is scary by UA standards, but don't worry about it). The place is breathtaking and so is the staff. In particular, you will most likely be greeted by Bilal (the hotel manager who wears several other hats). He is a true gem and a perfect gentleman. He took the greatest care of us as I am sure he does of all his guests. Mr. Khaldoun, as we have come to call him (it's not his real name but it is fitting since he is the boss), is equally amazing. What a surprise to see such commitment to a guest's comfort and happiness! you will love the place.*****",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2010,4,Don't let the alley stop you.,"Don't let the appearance of the alley stop you from going to the Riad Ibn Khaldoun's front door. Once you are inside, you find a comfortable riad, a very helpful and friendly staff, and a mini-museum of Morocco. Mr Lazrak is a great host and guide. Let him guide you through the maze of Fes. He seems to know everyone and he should be the Mayor. The Riad has a fascinating lobby, spacious bedrooms, and a terrific view from the rooftop terrace. The spiral stairs were a challenge for my old legs but the view was worth it.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2010,5,A Dream,"In this Riad my dream of 1001 Nights came true. Very beautiful and stylish old building. Very quiet and peaceful, right in the heart of the Old Town. The city of Fes is huge, but the location could not have been better, really everything is within walking distance of this hotel. My room (Suite Kaftan) was a dream. The bed was great (excellent mattress, variety of pillows for every taste). I had dinner in this Riad (hotel) twice, both times it was very good, the food excellent, the wine was delicious. Best part about the Riad: service. It seemed like everybody had nothing else on their mind other than how to make me happy. Bilal organized an amazing fashion show (I still have to smile when I think about it), the owner also organized a great guided tour of the Medina as well as a…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 January 2009,5,A Magical Place to Stay,"I didn't stay here, but when I go to Fes again I surely will. I was traveling in Morocco on a University sponsored trip to study the food culture of Morocco and we had one of our most rewarding experiences here. The proprietor showed our group around the food stalls in the medina and then the riads chef prepared a fabulous meal while we watched and lent a hand. We went on a tour. The minimal rooms were spacious and the roof had tables and afforded a great view of Fes. This is a small, yet professional run family establishment, which affords a rare opportunity to stay in a beautiful old building within the medina.",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2008,5,"Beautiful, elegant, unique","While I didn't stay here, I did have dinner here and it was a wonderful unique experience. We happened to have the proprietor as our guide through Fes that day when he invited our small group to his Riad for dinner that night. We had no idea what to expect but ended up being blown away by the experience. The place was gorgeous! We felt like royalty. As we ate a traditional Moroccan meal, we learned about the customs surrounding the procedure. The food and ambiance were wonderful. After dinner we had the opportunity to visit several of the rooms available for guests. They were very elegant with modern bathrooms. I wished I could have stayed for the night. After dinner we had the fun of playing dress up in some antique Moroccan clothing. Lots of fun and photos. Lastly…",Riad_Ibn_Khaldoun-Fes_Fes_Meknes
