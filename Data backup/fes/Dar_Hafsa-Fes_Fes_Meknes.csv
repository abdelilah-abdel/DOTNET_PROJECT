 January 2023,5,Pretty riad in the heart of the city,"Dar Hafsa was the best accommodation that we had during our Morocco trip! The riad is beautiful, especially the common area.

 December 2022,5,My Experience with Dar Hafsa,"It is my first trip to Morocco. The owner was personally there to meet up at the pick up point. The place was run by the owner and son. The hospitality extended was way above standard. We experienced many communication and co-ordination issues with the many tour operators and the owner and his son Aziz . In the evening, my wife and I join the family during the World Cup soccer game. I can now appreciate the Moroccan love for soccer. It is the human touch that I appreciated the most. Strongly recommended for those who want to find a cosy and convenient place to stay",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2022,5,My memorable stay at Dar Hafsa,"I am impressed by the hospitality by the riad staff. Going all ways to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The day we arrived (28 November 2022), the riad owner himself, Karim, was at the taxi drop off area to take us to the riad, Dar Hafsa, that was a lot of assurance that we would be in good hands as this is our first time in Fes. Thereafter, we were made to feel very at home. When we needed some help with the printing of boarding pass, the owner, Karim went all out to walk us to the printer shop, despite it being Friday and was very close to his prayer time. Very grateful for that. The owner's son Aziz was also very helpful and friendly throughout our four days' stay, watching world cup every night together and serving us mint tea while watching. He personally walked us…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2022,5,Number 1 in Hospitality,"The owner has amazing hospitality and helped with many of our requests. He assisted in coordinating with tour operators on many details. He also gave recommendations in shopping for various souvenirs to be cost effective. In addition, he was kind enough to let us extend beyond our check out time at the riad until our flight. In summary, this riad goes above and beyond in hospitality. Highly recommend!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2022,5,Absolutely amazing place to stay in Fez,"We took a bit of a last minute trip to Morocco and booked Dar Hafsa for our time in Fez. What a great decision! Abdul (the owner) and Aziz (his son) have been excellent hosts and amazing to us. We've gotten great suggestions on restaurants to go to, landmarks to visit, and more. Dar Hafsa itself is in a great location near the Blue Gate (only a few minutes walk) and near everything in the Medina. On top of that, the rooms are great and it has an amazing terrace on the top. We've had peaceful rest and they even still fed us breakfast the one morning we overslept. I am so grateful and appreciative of their hospitality with us. Absolutely amazing place to stay.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2022,5,Can’t Recommend Enough!,"This was the best possible place to start our journey in Morocco, I only wish we could have stayed longer. Abdul and his son were amazing hosts, and gave us the best advice for where to go, what to do, and what to avoid as well as what prices should be for anything we may want to buy or experience. The riad was both central to everything and beautiful with handmade mosaics everywhere and a terrace with the best views I had of the city. The bed was comfortable, and the included breakfast was delicious. We felt safe and welcome for our entire visit. If we’re ever back in Fez, we won’t hesitate to come back to Dar Hafsa!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Moreover, the Riad feels like a home with special attention from the owners. The rooms are beautiful, with amazing decorations and extremely clean. The beds are very comfy, and for me the most important are the bathrooms. The bathrooms in the room were not only clean but beautiful. Amazing warm water, great water pressure and new amenities.

He was also able to find a taxi for one member of our group who had to leave the city at 4:30 in the morning. He found us an excellent tour guide for our morning in Fes (ask for Muhammad!) For a good price and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. The dar itself is gorgeous on the inside and has a wonderful terrace on the roof.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The Dar is beautiful and has been recently renovated. As with all Dar and Riad, noise can travel from the central areas, depending on the other guests staying there. The room was comfortably furnished and there was always hot water in the shower. The breakfast was a wonderful array of breads and pastries and condiments.

He took my heavy luggage and guided me through the confusing alleys of Fes Medina. The location is one of the best: in the middle of all just 5 minutes to Bab Boujeloud and restaurants, 1 minute to the shops and ATM. Close enough to get everything what you need and far enough from the bustling noise. It's just a quite place and by the way it has one of the highest roof tops in town with an amazing view over the Medina.

There are many beautiful riads and hotels in Morocco yet this one stands out because of the owners who really care about their guests. We were stuck in Morocco (Fez) due to the border closing on account of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March 2020. Our flight was cancelled a couple times and we had no clue how long we'd have to stay in Morocco before being able to secure a flight out. We were the only guests of the Dar Hafsa.

 February 2020,5,"Wonderful decoration, wonderful staff.","Mohammed (manager) and Abdul Karim (owner) are fantastic hosts. Abdul Karim sent us a message with all the important information for our arrival. Nothing is too much for them. When we arrived, they had two rooms free, so Mohammed let us choose which we preferred. The bedroom was excellent. The bathroom slightly less so. It was extremely quiet day and night. There is a roof terrace with a wonderful view of Fes. Breakfast was huge, with a lot of variety of local bread and cakes. We enjoyed it enormously. We thoroughly recommend this hotel. Abdul Karim arranged for a lovely guide to take us around the medina the first day. This was a real bonus, because it is a real maze and he was able to take the best routes to all of the interesting sights. Also, as vendors realised we were with…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2020,5,Great stay,I stayed here last night with my sister and we had a lovely time. Very brief as we were only stopping over. We were made to feel so welcome that we’ll be returning later in our trip. The building is beautiful and I would definitely recommend.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,"Great location, great service.",Dar Hafsa was my home in Fes for 3 nights. And I did feel home in all and every way. I appreciated the clear arrival instructions on how to get to the hotel from the train station. I was met by one of the staff and we proceeded to the hotel which was easy to find on our own later on. The rooms were homy clean and decorated in the Moroccan style. Big breakfast was included and it provided us with all the energy that we needed to wonder around the old city all day. Abdelkarim explained to us everything we needed to see and how to get to different places. He is such a kind gentleman who went out of his way to make sure we had an enjoyable experience. Bab Almadina restaurant is a small place on the way where you can get delicious snacks. Also Abdelkarim recommended Almernesi Hamam…,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,4,Great experience,"this place is pretty amazing situated in the middle of the old Medina it gives you access to doors on both ends. The staff was very helpful. It might have been hard to find on my own but, that wasn't a problem as Ahmad met me at the gate and brought me to the guest house. Mr. Abdoul speaks English very well and happy to give suggestions on places to visit and for meals. Overall a great experience and I'd recommend it",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,Dar Hafsa - peace in the middle of the Medina,"We stayed two nights in Dar Hafsa. The owner met us outside the medina, at the Blue Gate, and guided us through the busy streets. The Dar is quiet, comfortable, very clean and conveniently located by the Main Street, which makes it easy to go back to after a day in the Medina labyrinth. The breakfast was a feast, with way too much food for two. The owner booked us an official guide for one of our days, so we could wander around and learn more about the history of the city. We recommend you bring cash, as the credit card machine is not always available. Great experience overall!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2020,5,"Great location, comfortable Home","Dar Hasfa is clean and comfortable, well presented and true to the pictures you see in Trip Advisor. This is not a hotel but a family home so my 5 stars is based on that as I was not expecting a 5 star hotel for the price I paid. There is some noise when other guests are coming/going but that is what you’d expect in a house and at no time was it disruptive. The owner Abdul Karim had Mohammed meet me at the Blue Gates so I wouldn’t get lost. Karim gave me lots of help understanding how to make my way around, interesting sites to visit and tips on bartering with salespeople. The breakfast was huge and kept me going all day until dinner. Karim arranged a guide, Redouand, who spent a day with me showing me the sites including ceramic making, rugs and weaving. Whilst I did buy some…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 December 2019,5,Great place perfect location,My son and I arrived late in Fes and were met at the Blue Gate by the staff who guided us to the hotel. The place is wonderfully decorated with timeless Moroccan furnishings and is 600 years old. Close to the action but on a back street as to be quiet at night. The owner and staff are wonderful and when we return to Fes /Médina we will stay here again.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2019,4,Lovely little place in heart of Medina,"Clean, with friendly staff. Great location. We stayed for a total of two nights, during which time we explored the city. On an unrelated note, I strongly recommend anyone who visits FeZ to plan most of their routes around the main streets in the Medina. When you veer off into back alleys, it can get a little stressful.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2019,5,A wonderful calm and hospitable place to stay in the Fez Medina -,“We had a wonderful stay at Dar Hafsa which was a comfortable and calm haven in the busy Fez Medina. The staff especially Abdul the owner and Mohammed were very welcoming and helpful. They helped us get the most out of our stay and were able to organise trips and and transport when we wanted them at very fair prices. They were always there to help and give us advice. The breakfast was wonderful and kept us going all day and mint tea was available when ever you wanted it. The location was ideal close to one of the main routes in the Medina so easy to find. If we ever go back to Fez we will definitely stay here again. We highly recommend Dar Hafsa where you will get a true Moroccan welcome.”,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2019,3,Friendly & Hospitable,"Well I’ve been back home for a week now. And it’s been a few weeks longer since saying goodbye to Morocco. The entire trip included visits to places afterwards, of which,the reality was nothing less than mind-blowing. I can’t give enough praise to my significant other for planning and sharing an awesome YOLO experience. I care more about who I travel with versus the places traveled. I have to cut this very short and say this trip puts an asterisk besides that sentiment The Dar Hafsa is quaint and clean. A nice private place to sleep and shower as you will want to be out in the medina to experience the culture of Fes. We paid for 3 nights yet only stayed 2 nights because of tours we had quickly arranged which overlapped our stay. We were still charged for a 3-day city tax …",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2019,5,Very Happy With My Choice,"I was a bit nervous coming to Fes as a solo traveller.I'd heard many things about hustlers,scammers etc as well as how easy it is to get lost in the 9400 streets of the Medina. I chose Dar Hafsa on the strength of previous TA reviews. I made the right choice.Right from the start the owner Abdul cared for my every need.From arranging the Taxi from the Airport to him personally meeting me at the Medina Gate.Nothing was too much trouble.The taxi he arranged was at a competitive rate.He was full.of good ideas about what to see and where to go.He also arranged Day trips to various places nearby.There was no pressure but it was nice to be aware of the prices,what to see etc. He really puts an effort in to please his guests.Although the prices for the excursions was quite steep it…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2019,5,Hidden Gem,My friend and I have recently spent two nights in hotel Dar Hafsa where the hospitality and location has blown us away. Upon arrival we were greated by the owner Abdul where we instantly felt at home as we sat down with some Moroccan tea and checked in. The owner even took time out of his night to walk with us through the Medina to show us the best restaurants and streets. The accommodation was in the perfect location and only a two minute walk from the Main Street. Abdul organised a guided tour of the Médina which was the best way to see and learn all there is to know about Fes. Would strongly recommend this stay to anyone travelling to Fes.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2019,5,Beautiful stay in Fes,"Me and a friend stayed in Dar Hafsa for 2 nights and the place is absolutely perfect. The accommodation itself is super clean and comfortable and is inside a traditional riad. It’s the perfect distance away from the main Medina and principle gate entrance into the Medina whereby the side street allows you to get a bit of calm amongst the madness of Fes, which I assure you will need if you are staying for a couple nights. The hosts Abdul and Mohammed really make you feel welcome upon entry and they make the best ‘Moroccan whisky’ (mint tea) whenever you want and will give you all the advice, guidance and tips to make your stay in Fes most memorable. Abdul actually organised a private official tour guide who took us around for a day and I can’t recommend this enough. He can also…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2019,5,Best place to stay in Fes Médina,"We are a family of 3 and we absolutely loved this Dar in Fes. The owner/ manager was so friendly nice and helpful . His staff went above and beyond for us. The location inside the Médina was perfect as only a 10 min walk from the blue gate and famous bab jould square and the incredible ruined garden restaurant which the staff helped us book a reservation. They organised a tour of the Médina our room was lovely, the breakfast was huge and delicious . The also helped us with options to get to Chefchouan and Meknes.

 October 2019,5,Moroccan hospital at its best,"We arrived in Fez from being overwhelmed in Marrakech. But our travel experience changed the moment we met the owner(Abdul) at Bab Boujeloud(Blue Gate). Abdul has really showed us the famed Moroccan hospitality we have heard about! He made sure we have beautifully prepared breakfast every day. He was checking in with us on where we were going to visit because he would give us the inside scoops on what to avoid, what to double down on, and of course offer recommendations on things we didn't know about. He also offered to connect usn with day tour operators and local guides. Though we didn't take up any offers due to our schedule, I have heard great stories from other guests at the same place. The rooms are clean and artfully decorated with Moroccan rugs, blankets, and zellige…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2019,5,Memorable stay in Fes,"We stayed here for 4 nights, and it was a wonderful trip! The city of Fes is certainly full of charm, and Abdul (the owner of this place) made our stay very comfortable. He was very attentive to each and every one of our needs, from tour options, to food recommendations and even walking us to get our bus tickets. Not only that, every single staff member of Dar Hafsa made us feel right at home (Mohammed and Yunis), were there to greet us first thing when we arrive, and also to wish us good night. The main area of the house (where we have breakfast) was just gorgeous. The woodworks, carvings, leading up all the way to the classic chandelier, bathed with the glowing natural light is a sight to behold (check out my photo).

 September 2019,5,"Would recommend, service was one of the best","We really enjoyed Dar Hafsa. The service was one of the best. The staff was proactive for the entire stay and treated you like family. We appreciated the initial email after booking letting us know how to reach their hotel and if we wished for them to organize a driver to pick us up (If it's your first time in Morocco or Fez, I highly recommend it because it is not that much more expensive (150MAD) than haggling your own taxi and then paying kids to show you through the medina to the hotel.) The staff gave us a tour and let us know about any logistics and tips (about food, shopping, haggling protocols, breakfast that is included etc.) and also answered any questions we had. You will not only feel physically safe at this place but rest assured if any of the shops really do a…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The communication before I arrived was appreciated- I was sent an email with detailed instructions on what to do on arrival at the train station. Make sure you take up the offer to have a member of staff meet you - I never would have found the place on my own. The owner is as friendly and helpful as all the reviews say, and our room had great water pressure, excellent air conditioning, and extra large sized towels. The breakfasts are as epic as they say, we were full until dinnertime. We arranged a walking tour with Reduone, he is fantastic! We wouldn't have seen half the sights he showed us if we tried to find them on our own. We were also given recommendations for places to eat that were clean and not too pricey.

 September 2019,5,Turned out to be the highlight of our trip to Fes,We booked our 2 night stay at Dar Hafsa after seeing the great reviews and now I can totally approbate those reviews. The place is a 600 year old home with great interiors giving you indeed an authentic experience. The rooms are beautiful and clean. The terrace has some really great views of the city. The breakfast was gratifying But above all it was the owner (Abdul Karim) and the support staff (Mohammed & Younis) that made our stay truly memorable. They welcome you with a mint tea while they do the check-in. They will give you honest and proper instructions about what to see around in Fes and and to navigate the famous medina.

We thoroughly enjoyed the Medina tour as well as the tour of Berber/Roman Ruins and Meknes for which Abdul Kareem arranged. We spent a couple of hours on two evenings drinking tea and talking with Eunis, the night staff. These conversations added immeasurably to my enjoyment of our stay. The triple room we stayed in was comfortable in every way, lovely towels, lots of windows, nice light. You will enjoy your stay at Dar Hafsa a heavenly calm in the busy Medina",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2019,5,Wonderful place and people,"We stayed 3 nights at Dar Hafsa and it was an excellent choice.

The instalations are lovely,including a terrace with good sights of the surroundings. The breakfast is huge and with good taste. But what makes the real difference and has made us feel like at home has been the people and the way they have treated us.

Abdoul met me at the main gate upon my arrival to Fes medina and walked me to the inn. Very helpful! You can easily get lost in Fes.

 June 2019,5,A gem!,"We only had a very limited time in Fes but our stay in Dar Hafsa made us feel that we had the best experience the city has to offer. The owner and staff are very warm, accommodating and kind. They spend time getting to know their customers and this made our stay truly rewarding. The place itself is a gem with its traditional Moroccan interiors, and the famous breakfast did not disappoint. The location is perfect as it is in the heart of the Medina, but situated perfectly so you are away from the hustle and bustle of the markets to allow restful sleep. Definitely a genuine gem of the city of Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2019,5,Value for money stay!,"The owner and staff really make us feel welcome and safe in medina! Remember to inform them about your arrival time so that they can pick you up at blue gate, we met a few ""aggressive"" people while waiting at the blue gate trying to ""help"" you carry luggage to your hotel. As we had only had 1 night stay, we booked through the owner a local guide at 250 dirhams for three hours to bring us around. Do your own research and inform the guide the places you want to go. While the local guide will bring you to souvenir shops to buy scarf/leather products/argan oil etc, there is no hard selling or pressure. The local guide also bring us to a very good food restaurant! As we need to leave early the next day for our desert tour, which is earlier than their usual breakfast time, the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2019,5,A home in Fes,"We stayed a group of three friends for a period of two nights and from the first moment we felt at home. The owner helped us plan our visit in the city and recommended us on good restaurants. The hotel is beautiful and the room was excellent. The location is inside the Medina so you have to go through crowded streets but it’s very close to many tourist attractions. Would definitely recommend and return if ever again in Fes. לכל הישראלים שמטיילים עצמאית ומחפשים מקום לישון בו, ממליץ מאוד. יחס חם וארוחת בוקר טובה",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2019,5,Absolutely fantastic!,"To be honest, I'm only going to repeat the other thousand five star reviews! Nestled in the beating heart of the medina, Dar Hafsa more than earned their reputation. Comfortable rooms. Helpful staff. Terrific views from the terrace. Enormous breakfast. Abdul is a gentleman, no favour too large. He organised a tour of Fes for one day, and a tour of Volubilis and Meknes for our second. Mohammed, his assistant, was an absolute star as well, forever helpful. The only suggestion for any potential guests is to contact the Riad before arriving as someone will then meet you, probably at the Blue Gate, and escort you through the chaos that is the medina!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2019,5,Short Break,"After getting off the taxi (which was arranged by the owner and cost €15), we were met by him (Abdul Karim) and he helped with our luggage to Dar Hafsa. We were also welcomed in by Mohamed and Younnes who bought us mint tea and sat and talked with us. They all spoke excellent English and Abdul arranged a tour guide (Redouane) for the following day. Our room consisted of a double and single bed. They were as comfortable as any bed we've slept in at any hotel in the UK. The room was traditionally decorated with lovely high ceilings and an air conditioning unit. The room was also spotless. The breakfasts were huge, fresh, tasty and impossible to finish. Dishes were whisked away in an instant and there was plenty of tea and fresh orange juice (the ideal way to start the day). My…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2019,5,Amazing riad!!,"This riad was absolutely perfect. Clean, comfortable, beautifully decorated, amazing food and great WiFi. What really makes this place, however, is the staff. They are kind, welcoming, and incredibly helpful in navigating the days you have in Fes. As a solo female traveler, I felt they always had my best interest at heart and went the extra mile to make me feel safe. One of the best places I’ve stayed — ever. I would highly recommend this riad to my friends and family, and I hope to return someday.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2019,5,An Experience of A Lifetime,"When reading the reviews of this warm, inviting, phenomenal home we found it daunting to match the eloquence of what has been written about Abdul, Miriam and the hosts at this house. Because they are all true and more. There are not enough stars to give Dar Hafsa because if there were we would give them. The description of the hotel on Trip Advisor and the area is exactly what it is. But we are not sure if words can describe what is in someone's heart and that goes for our hosts. One gets the feeling that they would move the sun, moon and stars for you if they could. There was nothing that Mariam and the staff would not do for us. Their warmth is genuine and it seems that they love what they do. Getting up in the middle of the night to take us to the gate and get us a cab…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2019,5,Rave,"Karim the owner is worth his weight in gold. Never in my world wide travel have I met a person so helpful,honest and friendly as Karim.

We loved the Dar all the people working there and especially the breakfast. All I can say is you are in real good hands.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2019,5,Wonderful experience here!,"Since our first minute at Dar Hafsa, everything was amazing. We were welcome by Abdul, the owner of the dar, who offered us the traditional and delicious Moroccan mint tea and was always ready to help us! Our room was beautiful and kept the traditional roots from the age of its construction (more than 600 years ago). Highly recommended for anyone looking for a friendly, traditional Dar in an excellent location. Thumbs up also for the breakfast and Yunus, the overnight staff, who is such a nice guy, always willing to help.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2019,5,An amazing Moroccan experience!,"What an experience it was staying at Dar Hafsa! Everything was perfect, the owner organised for us to get a car from the airport, he then met us at the top of the médina to walk us to the house. Dar Hafsa is a beautiful and traditional house, the beds are extremely comfortable, the showers are always hot and the place is spotless. And the breakfast... there was so much delicious food which will set you up for your day sightseeing. The owner organised for a good priced car to take us to Chefchaouen for a day trip, and also organised for a private guide to take us around Fes. He could not have been more helpful and it has made our Moroccan experience all the more wonderful! Thank you Dar Hafsa!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2019,5,"Excellent experience, excellent host","Located in the heart of the Medina and a short guided walk from the taxi drop off, they looked after us from the moment we got through passport control. Airport transfer, day trip to Chefchaouen, walking tour of Fez, guided walks to restaurants, all sorted out for us seemlessly and at great prices. Rooms were spotless, showers were hot and beds were comfy. The mint teapot was straight out every time we arrived back in the door - legend of a host!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2019,5,Highly recommended,"Located in the heart of the medina. Charming rooms with thick blankets available in colder seasons. Beautiful roof Terrance looking onto the hills. Great hospitality, we were allowed to leave our bags after check out whilst we explored the city on our last day. They met our taxi outside the medina after a late flight to show us to the Dar as it can be difficult to find the first time. Abdul gave us great recommendations for food and buying leather and ceramics. Overall a great first experience in Morocco.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2019,5,"A cozy Dar in Fez Medina, feel like home!","This is our 1st time visiting Morocco, no regret of choosing Dar Hafsa, a two nights stayed at this cozy Dar (600 years old house) located in Fes Medina the old city. The owner Abdul Karim and his staffs are very helpful and professional, made us feel like home. Beautiful setup, clean room and comfortable bed. He gave us good advise on what to see and do, the walking tour guide that he helped us to hire Redwan has good knowledge and very patient, we enjoyed our 6 hours walked with him. We strongly recommend Dar Hafsa and will definitely stay here again if we revisit Fez in future. Abdul Karim and team, thanks for your great hospitality!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2019,4,Friendly and helpful people,"This is a wonderful place to stay if you like to spend few nights inside the old city of Fes, the owner & his people are superb, very helpful and even help to advise us what need to take notes if like to walk around the old town, he even help us to contact official government tourist tour lead for us on heritage city walk tour.

 February 2019,5,Exceptional!!! Stay at Dar Hafsa,"Our stay was just perfect at this 600 year old DAR. We had a BEAUTIFUL room waiting for us complete with hot mint tea, breakfast was provided every morning. The staff was absolutely amazing and we were treated like family. Abdul and Mohammed answered all our questions, recommended where to eat and even booked two tours for us. Great quiet place to sleep in the Médina.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2019,5,Exceptional service with a smile,"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a 9 day adventure across Morocco and it was by far the best place we stayed. The thing that makes it really stand out was the hospitality of Abdul and Mohammed. They make a real point about the fact that you should treat the hotel as if you're staying with family and it really showed. As an example, on the last day of our stay Mohammed spent at least half an hour walking me across town to find somewhere to print out some boarding passes. In addition to the service the room was lovely and clean, there is a rooftop terrace with an excellent view over the city and to top it all off, you are presented with the most enormous breakfast each morning! Just a quick word of caution to anyone booking - when you book you should receive an email from…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2019,5,Stay here if you want to be pampered!,"This is the best place! Breakfast is immaculate and massive, always served with a smile. We arrived with no real plans and the staff took care of us. From day tours of the medina and tannery, to day trips outside of Fes; you will not have any let downs in this place. Great restaurant recommendations and even atraditional hammam. I cannot waitro come back one day!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2019,5,Awesome Little Gem!,"Dar Hafsa is run by a small family in Fes Medina with about 4 or 5 rooms, an awesome central room with an open ceiling, and very awesome and ornate decoration. The family was extremely nice and had the best recommendations of restaurants to eat and places to go. They had a great spread for breakfast, and always waited on us hand and foot. I'd recommend this place to anyone AND I also want to recommend their new spot that's opening up shortly. A thousand stars.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2019,5,Welcome to home away from home !,"This was our first time to Fez, when choosing Dar Hafsa we chose it because of the location. We received so much more then that. The owner Abdul goes out of his way to make sure you have a wonderful visit. He is a helpful, gracious and kind host. He assisted us with a guide to tour the mazes of the Medina, I suggest that the first day in the Medina you ask Abdul about a guide, you won’t regret it. Abdul also recommended excellent restaurants, tours and aspects of the Medina that made our stay even more enjoyable. Abdul’s staff at the Riad were also very helpful, we appreciated the incredible breakfasts and services that they provided, at the end of the day we very much enjoyed our mint tea and discussions with Mohammed. The Riad itself felt like a wonderful…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2019,5,Just Perfect- Book Now!,"Our visit to Dar Hafsa was truly excellent. The owner Abdul could not have been more welcoming or accommodating He truly went the extra mile from helping us look for table cloths at the market to recommending great restaurants and authentic Hammon. His staff was equally friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean, warm and beds super comfortable. Breakfast was delicious with an abundance of choices. The location is perfect-close to all- except expect to walk a bit to get a taxi. I would highly recommend Dar Hafsa - you cannot go wrong with this choice and will not be disappointed. I hope to go back one day and visit again.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2019,5,Home from home,"Beautifully decorated Riad with exquisite painted woodwork and traditional Moroccan blanket on the bed with matching curtains. The host and his Muhammad’s are very hospitable and they bend over backwards to accommodate your wishes, organise activities and help with shopping. Although it does not have the extra facilities of a hotel it has the heart and warmth of a home with an authentic Moroccan experience. On a practical note the bed is comfortable, the showers have great pressure and the breakfast is spectacular, served on traditional Moroccan crockery. Will definitely returning the future!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2019,5,Best Decision I made!,"When I have previously stayed in Morocco which I have done a number of times; I’ve mainly stayed in 5 star hotels. On this occasion I booked Dar Hafs with my wife for four nights, largely due to the number of positive reviews that this place has coupled with its superb location in the heart of the Médina of Fes. It did not disappoint and it was the best decision I could have made. Our flight was delayed but this still did not stop Mohammad from meeting us at the gate of the city at 1.30am even though he was back awake for the breakfast shift! The Riad is stunning, it’s been restored to a high standard whilst full of character. Our room was spotlessly clean & even in this cold weather we were grateful for the heating. There was a TV which had English channels but we spent most…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2018,2,Very disappointed,"Ok I had very high expectations having read the reviews but really this was the worst place we stayed at in Morocco amd we stayed at 8 Riads during our trip. I only added one star because the owner was kind enough to walk us to the spice store where we got really good quality spices. Other than that, it was really a very bad experience. The sheets had not been changed since the last guest. I found a human hair under my pillow when I went to get into bed. It was gross and disgusting. The bathroom had just one soap dispenser, it the worst part about the bathroom was that there was oenclsure or even a divider between toilet, sink and shower and so bathroom is flooded ter one person shower. So I just skipped the shower. I just wanted to get out of there.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2019,5,Amazing staff and cozy atmosphere,"Our stay at Dar Hafsa was truly unforgettable. Abdul Karim is a hands-on owner who takes the time to care for his guests. Everyone at Dar Hafsa wants you to feel at home, the room was beautiful and very comfortable, and we were recommended great things to do in Fes. The location is convenient and the breakfast included is delicious. My husband and I will not hesitate to come back to Dar Hafsa.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2019,5,All the reviews are true!,All the positive reviews below perfectly reflect our experience staying at Dar Hafsa for three nights. Perfect hosts who take greater care of their guests and a proud of their amazing city. Very generous breakfast (ask about the amazing butter) and lots of helpful advice. They are opening up a new larger place soon which will be very interesting to watch grow. Highly recommended and thank you Abdul Karim for your amazing hospitality.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2018,5,Amazing location off the main street,"From the airport we borrowed the taxi driver’s cellphone and a member from Dar Hafsa picked us from the ‘blue gate’ and led us through the Médina. After showing us some places to eat and have coffee we were amazed by how many narrow streets were in the old city that didn’t appear on google maps. After setting our things in the room we were welcomed with mint tea on the roof as we prepared to venture back onto the streets. Everything that we needed we could get help with from the staff at Dar Hafsa. Rooms were clean and cozy with amenities like warm blankets, towels, TV and comfortable beds. Delicious breakfast and very nice and friendly staff. We definitely recommend to stay at Dar Hafsa.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2018,5,Nice stay in Medina with wonderful hosts,"We stayed for two nights at Dar Hafsa during December, 2018. The property is in a nice location in the Medina and has a lovely breakfast area and terrace. Our room was on the first floor and was comfortable with a tv and couch along with the two twin beds. Everything was comfortable and clean, although the room was a bit dark due to the colored windows for privacy. The hosts were very warm and helpful with suggestions and always available for help. They met us at the car drop off and escorted us to and from the Riad. Breakfast was huge and delicious.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2018,5,Welcome home,"My mum and I stayed at Dar Hafsa for 3 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Even before we arrived, the family running the riad sent us e-mails asking how we were going to arrive and advising us about precautions to take when arriving in Fes. When we got to Bab Boujloud, Abdul Karim met us and walked us through the labyrinth of the Medina to the riad, a beautiful 600 year old building restored by his family. Every bit of this riad is a work of art; the intricately painted doors, zellij tiles, scenic roof top and even the variety of pots used to serve mint tea. Abdul Karim was very warm and affectionate, and freely offered suggestions on what we could do in and around Fes, from visiting Chefchaouen to wandering through the meandering pathways in Fes. His staff members…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2018,5,"Amazing hosts, service and mint tea!","We had the greatest three days staying at Dar Hafsa! It started with the Riad’s owner, Abdul, meeting us at the gate to help us navigate the streets of Fes. This was followed by enjoying countless numbers of mint tea, and getting great advice & help on what to see and do. Abdul helped us to hire a guide for a day, and suggested great places for us to visit. The riad was beautiful and the rooms are very nice and clean.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2018,4,The Essence taste of Medina,"When we arrived infront of the Blue gate of old Medina, I was surprised the owner of our homestead personally escorted us to where we are staying. He's there every day and explained everything. The place was descent and very homely. I had the best breakfast there. It's a family business, people are personable, caring and assisted us in whatever was needed. There's a heater, hot water, great tea/coffee, warmer than dessert. It was a good experience for shopping area, getting to know the people of Fes, and beautiful sceneries. I would highly recommend this place if you're traveling on a budget, short stay, and want to explore around.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2018,4,Dar Hafsa,"My friends and I stayed here for a few nights. The breakfast and tea that they provided was really nice and there was a helper who was very helpful.

But we did book our desert tour and transport from Fes to Marrakesh through Dar Hafsa which was good.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2018,4,Nice riad,Was here for 2 nights. Was met at the blue gate but the owner. The room was small but reasonably good with a small tv with Arabic channels. Breakfast was sufficient. They arrange a packed breakfast because we left early to the desert.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2018,4,Perfect place for 3 nights in Fes,There's nothing like staying in the Medina. Mohamed met met me at the Blue Gate and guided me through the short walk through narrow streets to Dar Hafsa. I was warmly welcomed and made to feel at home from the beginning.

We would not stay anywhere else when we return.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2018,5,Fantastic hospitality and great dar,"My husband and I spent three nights here while in Fez. The owner, Abdul, and Mohamed were amazing people. They helped us navigate the Fez Medina and make sure we didn’t get lost. They provided friendly advice on how to deal with the shops and the tour guides. When we needed to get our boarding pass printed, they offered to walk us to the Internet cafe and make sure we knew the price. As US southerners, their hospitality put us to shame. The accommodations were amazing. We had the top room and the room was amazing. Super comfortable and the bathroom had the hottest hot water we had all trip.

We sat in this beautiful traditionally Moroccan decorated house and shared some mint tea. How appreciated after a long day of traveling. Abdul tried to get a sense of what we were looking to see and do in Fes. He recommended that we get a tour guide, because the medina is impossible to navigate on your own.

Not only that but Abdul invited me around to Dar Hafsa for mint tea and took me on a tour of the Blue Gate where we bought street food. He has great knowledge of the area and likes to use local contacts for good food, services etc. He's even arranged for a private tour guide for me. The Dar Hafsa hotel is beautifully decorated, looked clean and tidy and feels welcoming and cosy. I believe there are 6 rooms in total, 4 for guests.

Mohamed was equally helpful and even took us to a kiosk in the medina to sort out our cell phone issues. Our room on the second floor was small but full of character.

 September 2018,4,Perfect location and a good breakfast to start the day,"Dar Hafsa is conveniently located off one of the main streets with its stores and, importantly, access to bottled beverages and snacks; and about 5 to 10 minute easy walk from the Blue Gate. The rooms are clean but small and a bit crowded. We had to keep our luggage under the bed to move around the room without tripping. Breakfast is fulfilling and a good start of the day. The only two things that bothered us a bit (and only a bit) is that the rooms have windows to the inner patio and there's noise, especially in the morning with other guests being served breakfast. The second is that, while they claim to act only in your best interest, the owner is a bit pushy helping you find guides, taxi drivers, and services which made us believe he is benefiting from those services as much…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,A little gem in a lovely city,"We thoroughly enjoyed our very brief stay in Dar Hafsa, and as many of the reviews here allude to it was mainly down to Abdul and Mohammed. They gave us a wonderful welcome, excellent conversation and a delicious breakfast! The room was pleasant - in case any new travellers to Morocco (like we were) are not aware, the rooms in a riad look inwards so are quite dark but this room was cosy and nicely decorated. The shower room was wet room style but functioned well with powerful shower. The roof terrace is lovely and the main space inside delightful with beautiful traditional detailing - a nice place to start the day with traditional Moroccan breakfast! We tried to stay here again on our way back we liked it so much, but unsurprisingly Dar Hafsa was fully booked. Next time!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,Great stay!,"Was only in Fes a few days and this was the perfect place to stay. Abdul and Mohamed are great host. My favorite part was evening tea with Abdul, Abdul’s son and Mohamed. We would sit and talk some nights about everything and nothing. Abdul is wonderful! And Mohamed makes the best mint tea lol!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,Stay at Dar Hafsa,"We loved our stay at this riad. So comfortable, so welcoming, so beautiful, so clean. Can’t say enough about the positive experience. Abdul Kareem picked us up from our taxi drop-off and greeted us with the most welcoming smile. We knew right off we had chosen the right place. From our convos over mint green tea to the recommendations of what to do/see/eat while in Fes to him and his staff helping to facilitate tours and taxi pick-ups, everything was executed flawlessly. Mohammed, who works at the riad, is one of the nicest people you’ll meet. He was the icing on the cake. Oh and the place is beautiful if I hadn’t already mentioned that. The roof terrace is a must. We’ve gone up there every night of our stay.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,Friendly and so helpful,"Started here for three days with my wife and son. Was able to arranged a transfer with the Riad directly (highly recommended) and the price was very reasonable and avoid the need to barter with the taxi drivers outside the airport. The riad is in very authentic in its decor and Moroccan owned, so was glad in supporting a local, homegrown business. Breakfast is extremely generous.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,One of the Best experience,"Stayed here for 3 nights. The positive experience started with the welcome email from the owner recieved immediately on booking. The email contained very valuable information that was relevant to a first time visitor to Morocco. As requested I called from the train station. I was met at the main gate (blue gate) by Mr Abdul Kareem and was escorted to the Riad. The Riad is on the main Street itself - less than 5 mins walk. The place beautifully furnished and looks more like part of 'Arabian Nights'. Very large sitting room with 20'+ ceiling and natural light. My room was very spacious, clean and aesthetically furnished with attached bath. The owners are very warm and friendly and go out of their way to make you feel at home and comfortable. They are ready with local tips and…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,First class Moroccan hospitality.,"We were greeted with a pot of hot mint tea and a smile, the owner and Muhammed were incredibly helpful and gave us lots of advice, we even got shown where the bus station was and sat and watched some football with them. The house itself is more beautiful than the pictures do justice to, and there is a lovely rooftop terrace where you can view the cityscape. Thank you very much for the stay Dar Hafsa, hopefully see you again!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2018,5,Very accommodating and kind,"Our stay at Dar Hafsa was fantastic, the room was lovely, and the location of the riad is almost central - breakfast is very nice, and the team were very friendly and gave us plenty of tips on how to navigate the city",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,5,Fantastic place to stay in Fez.,"We stayed here for 2 nights in April. Easy to get to with a little help from a local, from the Blue Gate. Lovely family owned traditional Morocco style accommodation. Great breakfast. Lots of cafes & shops within a few minutes walk. We loved our stay here.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2018,5,Felt like home!,"The dar hafsa team welcomed us very warmly and they made us feel at home right away. The communication before and during the stay was great, too. Wether we had questions about places in the city, desired to have some tea on the terrace or spontaneously wanted to book a room at their place again for the end of our trip: they were always willing to help and showed great hospitality. The rooms are simple but beautiful. We also enjoyed their delicious breakfast and the fun talks with the staff!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Great experience,"We had a very enjoyable couple of nights at Dar Hafsa. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable. The location in Fes was nice and central, easy to return to. The host, Abdul, met us personally at the Blue Gate when we arrived to guide us to the hotel. He also gave us tips on restaurants to eat at (which turned out quite good as it was cheaper than the others). All of the employees were very hospitable and friendly. All in all I recommend it highly.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2018,5,Enjoyable stay in Dar Hafsa,"Everything is fantastic! The staff is nice and make us feel like home, the breakfast is good, the room is clean, the location is convenient! Prior to our arrival, the host also had quick response to our query and sent his staff to pick up us at the blue gate. Will definitely stay here if I go to Fes again.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Wonderful experience!!,"Dar Hafsa is the best hotel we have stayed at in Morocco. It was very clean and reasonably priced. All staff were extremely kind, friendly, and hospitable-- they really went out of their way to provide us with a great experience. We cannot wait to come back again!!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Surpassed our expectations,"We had an amazing experience staying at Dar Hafsa. Starting with the owner Abdul Karim, to the staff, Soufian, Mohamed and Zakia, we received extraordinary hospitality beyond the line of duty. We stayed at the Dar for one week and felt truly at home. The house was spotless, the breakfast was amazing and the area was very safe. We walked the Medina streets late at nights (even passed 1:30 am) at the end of the Fez festival concerts and felt extremely safe. The service was second to none and was clearly from their heart. If we are in Fez again, we will be staying at Abdul with no hesitation. If you are looking for an authentic local experience, this is the place.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Exceptional experience in Fes Medina,"The whole team at Dar Hafsa were fantastic, right from Abdul meeting us personally at the Blue Gate on arrival - what a treat to spend time in this wonderful house, with great hosts and the warmest hospitality. We would definitely recommend this 'experience' to others - it is far more than a great place to stay, it will be our lasting memory of Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Authentic experience,"It was just a fantastic experience, it was like being with family or really good friends...very laid back and extremely helpful. The world cup was on and it was great just hanging out watching a game together and talking about stuff. The house is beautiful. You're right in the heart of the medina and that terrace with mint tea in the evening really makes you feel like you're just having an authentic experience. Just really great people.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Very nice place,We head a great time staying at Dar Hafsa. The hotel is centrally located in the heart of the Medina. The breakfast is really good an the terrace has a great view. Very nice place and very friendly and helpfull staff! I would come back anytime!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,The magic of Fes,"Let me start by saying that our host Abdul Kareem is one of the most genuine and gracious people we met in Morocco. This Riad, Dar Hafsa, is such a beautiful place and each room is special in its own way. We were lucky enough to stay in the room on the third floor with easy access to the terrace where we enjoyed mint tea and enjoyed the beautiful view during the day and at night. Fes seems like it would be easier to get around than Marrakesh but Abdul recommended that we get an official tour guide from the Department of tourism to take us to some significant landmarks in the Medina that otherwise, we may have missed. After our amazing breakfast served to us that morning, provided by Dar Hafsa, the tour guide came to the Riad to start our tour. The tour was only 400dh and the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Excellent stay with people who treat you like family,"Dar Hafsa has the best service I've received at any Moroccan hotel during my 12 days. On our first day, we got lost and ended up at the wrong parking garage. We called the owner of the hotel, and he sent one of his employees to the other side of the city to help us navigate to the proper lot. There, he negotiated with the parking attendant who was trying to rip us off (30 dirham a night versus the normal 20). He walked us to the hotel, and checked us in. The owner came later in the evening and answered all our questions about the city and where to go. He gave us the name of a tour guide (who was phenomenal) whom we contacted the next day, as well as helped us with getting our clothes laundered (via a maid, who we dealt with directly). He and his staff were absolutely phenomenal…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,A Home To Stay In,"To preface, this is my first (and most likely will be my only) review on Trip Advisor snd I have created an account so that I can confirm this is a great choice. My 2 night stay at Dar Hafsa was truly sublime; the employees and owners were cordial and helpful, and went out of their way to help us have an amazing time in Fes. We were guided to the hotel through the city and were given excellent recommendations for eating, leisure and shopping. The owner would join us for tea and breakfast and make sure that everything was to our liking. We were treated like family by all who were associated with Dar Hafsa. The rooms were beautiful and everything was in excellent working order. I strongly suggest staying here on any trip to Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Great hotel and the nicest owner!!,"We had a great experience at Dar Hafsa!! Beautiful hotel, great breakfast and location. Abdul Kareem made us feel like family by showing us around on our first night and checking in with us to make sure we are doing well. He arranged a great tour for us and gave us advice on where we could walk around on our own. The hotel is very clean and the tea is incredible!! Definitely recommend this place for anyone traveling here!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2018,5,Perfect Moroccan Trip,"We had an absolute fabulous time at dar hafsa! As two American university students we did not know too much about fes coming in, and the staff at Dar Hafsa completely took care of us from walking us to and from the taxi to the airport, arranging a tour for us, and giving us any help that we needed. The building itself was also beautiful and everything we could have asked for!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Excellent,"This was a great place to stay. The location in the medina is excellent, the accommodations are very pleasant, and the staff is fantastic. The owner Abdul was a huge help to us in many ways. Highly recommended",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Great start to our moroccan trip!,"Thank you Abd-el karim, Soufyan and everyone else for a fantastic 2 nights in Fez! Staff are very friendly and the interior is very beautiful, and authentically moroccan! Located in the heart of Fez Al-Bali it's also a great location to go exploring from and take a mint tea break on the roof halfway through The first but hopefully not the last Egyptians to visit!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Comfy stay in medina and quite close (and easy access) to the blue gate,"Room is comfy and clean with daily housekeeping. Though it's inside the Fes medina maze, it's along a side street which directly connected to one of the main street. And it's just about 10 min walk from the blue gate (Bab Jeloud). Breakfast is good. Host and staff are very friendly, helpful and informative.If you wanna try to stay inside the medina to get a taste of the way of living and neighborhood, this b&b is a nice choice. Rooms doesn't offer any view (well, it's inside the medina) but the terrace gives a nice glimpse of the boundless and dense medina.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Great stay for a quick visit to Fes,"I had a short two night stay in Fes before heading back home, but I was made to feel very welcome by the team. The location is great, 5-10 mins walk from the main gate (depending how quick you walk and how busy it is) and is very easy to find. You wont get lost trying to get there. All the staff have great conversational skills and can offer travel advice or just a quick chat when heading back into the Riad for the evening. The breakfast spread the the most varied, and largest I ate on my trip. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again in the future. In hindsight though, the walking tour I booked through them was probably not so worth it for me as I didn't want to buy anything/shop and a large part of that was spent going into various shop (note, there wasn't any pressure to buy…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Enhance your trip to Fes,"You’ll probably find better places, better amenities, better price etc etc in Fes But that’s not what a holiday is all about. It’s about perceptions and how you feel. And that’s where Abdul and his team excel. They make you feel good. Of course the place is pretty good too and has all the basic amenities you’d expect at this price and in the heart of Fes el Bali. But that’s not what sets it apart. It’s the personalised looking after that does. Running a guesthouse is a hard job and so many things can go wrong. Of course people are entitled to their opinion and have expectations. But know what you are getting into. It’s a 600 year old house lovingly restored to look traditional yet have modern amenities. The rooms face each other around a small courtyard as also the streets of…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,A completely magical place!,"Absolutely stunning restored ancient riad. Could not be a better taste of exotic, timeless Morocco. Our room was spacious with lots of character and comfort. We arrived after hours, and the staff was tremendously helpful and accommodating. They really went above and beyond to make sure we got here safe and sound. Even though it is in the madina, it was totally quiet, and we slept well. Breakfast was splendid, and the staff helped us plan our time in Fez. Very satisfied, will definitely stay at Dar Hafsa the next time we are in Fez!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Beautiful riad in the heart of the medina,I love this riad! The service was impeccable. They met us late around 11pm at the entrance to the Medina to guide through to the riad. They provided us delicious mint tea whenever we requested and the included breakfast was a feast of various pastries. The riad itself is incredibly beautiful with intricate inlaid tile and woodwork throughout. The room is gorgeous and it is located far enough from the Main Street at night that it will be relatively quiet (you may hear a cat or two). Be sure to check the views from the rooftop! Highly recommended.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Moroccan Hospitality at its Finest,"Incredibly happy with our choice to stay three nights at Dar Hafsa. Owner Abdul Karim and his staff Mohammed and Soufyane are truly wonderful hosts. From the moment we first exchanged emails to book the room the communication was smooth and efficient. We appreciated Mohammed coming to meet us at Bab Boujloud and showing us where to find parking for our rental car and helping us with our bags through the medina. Dar Hafsa has been wonderfully restored and the rooms are tastefully decorated in a traditional Moroccan style. The rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, the water was hot, and the shower had lots of water pressure. The WIFI was fast and worked well. Breakfasts were plentiful (including coffee) and they accommodated my Celiac gluten-free diet. Abdul and Soufyane…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,"Beautiful riad, friendly staff","The riad is beautiful, the staff very helpful and friendly. Breakfast huge- combination of local and continental, with fresh eggs. Extra bonus was recommendations of treatments for cold from Muhammed and tea with night staff- Sufjan, who is very eager to learn foreign languages!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2018,5,Dar Hafsa was great!,"We’ve had the most wonderful 3 nights in Fez. The city is great but it’s Dar Hafsa that has really made the trip wonderful. We’ve been looked after at every step from the moment we walked through the door. The rooms are very comfy, breakfast plentiful and the roof terrace tranquil. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,5,Our introduction to Morocco,This is our first visit to Morocco. Our host and his staff at Dar hafsa were incredibly helpful and welcoming. Breakfasts were fresh and big and any requests we made for help in booking tours or locating food were received with enthusiasm.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,4,Lovely,"Great hotel, clean, lovely atmosphere and good location. Mint tea on tap and staff showed me how to make it. Happy to arrange tours for us at a reasonable price. Good value for money, the breakfast was huge and included in the price. Would recommend and would come again",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,5,"Wonderful staff, homey experience","Really loved our stay at this dar (better than the other Dar we stayed at) because of their extremely kind hospitality, mint tea welcome, cute and cozy room, really great breakfast spread, and overall wonderful owners and staff. Highly recommend. We also took an okay tour arranged by their affiliate because we were in Fez for only a short time (only recommend the tour if you are tight on time because it was a mediocre tour).",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,5,Nicest hosts you can come across,"We started our 12 day trip of Morocco at Dar Hafsa. We were picked up in a taxi arranged by the Riad and greeted by the owner who showed us through the busy streets of fez medina and to our hotel. We were welcomed with tea and a chat while we checked in. The owner was lovely but we spent more time with the other two staff, these guys were super nice, humorous, and friendly. We felt extremely well looked after by everyone at Dar Hafsa. They seemed to genuinely care that we had a good stay. The building is charming, very old and quaint. The breakfast is lavish but unfortunately nothing vegan was available which the staff apologised for and tried their best to cater for us. We are now at the end of our trip and we have to say that the hospitality at Dar Hafsa has not been matched…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,5,Fès Dar Hafsa,"Great place to stay within the walls of the Medina. Clean, great food and incredible staff. We felt welcomed and at home. Anything you need, the Dar Hafsa will gladly provide. Enjoy your stay in Morroco !!!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2018,5,A gem in the medina,"Service was very friendly and helped us get linked up with a great guide to tour the medina. Wish I could have stayed longer! Staff were able to meet us at the blue gate and guide us to the hotel, which would have been difficult to find on our own. It's not far from the blue gate, and located near lots of shops and restaurants.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2018,5,Great place to stay in Fès,"My wife and I stayed at Dar Hafsa for two nights in March and were very happy with our stay. The owner and the staff are very friendly and they really make an effort that everything is well. Very good location for exploring the Medina. Good breakfast consisting of local bread and pastries plus egg, yogurt, marmalade, cheese and coffee. There is also mint tee offered to guests during the day at no cost. The building is very impressive, about 800 yrs old, and inside it looks almost like a little palace. It is very nicely decorated. You have everything you need for a comfortable stay, including private bathrooms, but of course in a building that is 800 yrs old you can not expect everything to be like in a modern hotel.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2018,5,Wonderful hospitality from the very beginning!,"Our visit started with me leaving my mobile phone in the cab. The owner, Abdul Kareem, sprung into action and got us back to the train station and then to the police station, where my phone was found. He would take no reward for his help. The property is beautiful and peaceful and 7-8 minute walk into the Medina. At first it seemed inconvenient, but after one day, we were so happy we were there. We stayed in the blue room. What a wonderful visit to Fes and Dar Haddad was a big part of that. Two days wasn’t enough!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2018,5,Excellent Hospitality in Fez,"Owner and staff are wonderful. They offer helpful advice, guidance and an authentic experience in Fez. Wonderful breakfast as well. Housekeeping even laundered my clothes after a long trip throughout Morocco. A wonderful ending to a great trip in Morocco.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2018,5,An authentic experience,My daughter and I stayed 2 nights at Dar Hafsa and our host Abdul was very caring and looked after us very well. He arranged for a car to take us to Casablanca and suggested a wonderful inexpensive place to have dinner. Abdul arranged for a tour guide as well. Do not expect high luxury. You will be staying in an old dar that has been in Abdul’s family for over 100 years. The breakfast looked delicious though we didn’t have any choosing to walk first and get a cappuccino elsewhere.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2018,5,A Beautiful Dar in the heart of the Medina,"We loved our stay at this beautiful Dar conveniently located close to one of the main streets in the Medina. We were welcomed at the Blue Gate by the owner Abdul who personally walked us back to the Dar. We enjoyed a cup of mint tea while he arranged a tour for us and made suggestions for our dinner This is a beautiful traditional home in the heart of the old city and we were made to feel like honoured guests in every respect. The breakfast was substantial and delicious and the rooms comfortable and charming but the part we valued most was the warmth of our host and his staff. If you want to experience the old city at it's best we highly recommend Dar Hafsa. Thank you Abdul, Mohammad and Sofiane for making our stay so wonderful.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2018,5,Best place to stay in fes!,"My boyfriend and I spent our first 2 nights here in fes and couldn't have hoped for a better welcome. We were picked up from the airport and walked to the riad where the owner welcomed us (despite it being 11:30 at night!!) Throughout the stay the owner and his staff were amazing - so helpful and nothing was too much. On our first morning they sat us down with a map and marked out things to see. He also gave us advice on booking our trip to chefchaouen, on where to eat, hammams etc and even arranged a trip to volubilis and meknes for us the day after we checked out! Once we were lost and bumped into one of the guys who worked at the riad down a side street and he walked us all the way to the restaurant we were trying to find! Breakfast here is the best! Huge and loads of…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2018,5,Cozy Riad in excellent location in Fes,"This Riad was my trip’s best surprise. Mister Abdekkarim is a gentleman always willing to help.

 January 2018,5,Excellent place to stay!,"I chose this place based on the perfect reviews. I was not disappointed! We spent 7 nights in this Dar. The owner and staff are so friendly, hospitable, nice, helpful, and funny. We loved being in the Medina or historical center. It is the highlight of the city of Fes and all of Morocco. This Dar is located in an easy to find part of the Medina, near the main road, which is important because the Medina is an extremely complex maze of 9,400 streets! The shower has plenty of hot water, which is far from a certainty in North Africa. The heater kept our room at a comfortable temperature in cold winter days and nights. The bed was comfortable. The Dar was beautiful and clean and so was our room. The guide the owner of the Dar reserved for us was excellent and this is essential for…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2018,5,Your Home in Fes,"Dar Hafsa feels like a riad should-- your home away from home. The space is comfortable, clean, and beautiful. Check out traditional Moroccan design without compromising comfort-- the rooms contain spacious bathrooms that provide a refreshing place to shower, as well as comfortable beds. Each room also contains an AC/heat unit to keep it at your desired temperature. What's particularly notable about Dar Hafsa is its staff. Abdul Kareem made us feel exceptionally welcome, more like family than paying guests. He himself picked us up from the Blue Gate and walked us to the riad so we wouldn't get lost. He arranged a wonderful tour guide for us to see Fes, and provided his own recommendations about what we should see around the city. He sat and chatted with us over mint tea, and one…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2018,5,Outstanding Riad in the Heart of Fes' Medina,"Over 600 years old, Dar Hafsa has a great deal of history for guests to experience. First, there is intricate, Moroccan design work in the common area and the guest rooms. Second, the Riad is in the heart of the Old Medina. Both of these qualities allow guests to have an authentic Moroccan experience. The rooms are extremely comfortable with everything one could possibly ask for: AC/heat, TV, bathroom, shower, and much more. The Riad also has a terrace with a sitting area that is protected from the sun and rain. From the terrace, guests have a gorgeous panoramic view of the Old Medina and the distant mountains. Finally, Dar Hafsa is minutes away from Fes' best sightseeing attractions. Perhaps the most outstanding aspect of Dar Hafsa is the owner of the Riad and his staff.…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2018,5,Great value for money,"Dar Hafsa is a nice and clean house in a calm part of the medina (but very close to one of the main “arteries”). The staff is very friendly and willing to help with all kinds of advice. The rooms are comfortable (the beds are nice and firm). The only complaint is that the pillows are very stiff (for our taste). Bathrooms are clean and there are no issues with hot water. The breakfast is included and is huge (mostly Moroccan breads, delicious honey, olives and cheese). Very recommendable if you want a reasonably priced and very comfortable stay.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,5,Dar Hafsa Rocks,"Dar Hafsa is a small guesthouse in the Medina- it offers comfort, good food, and personalized service by owner Abdul Karim and his staff. Our room was well heated with a great mattress and plenty of hot water. There is also a roof terrace with views of the Medina and mountains. Communication with Dar Hafsa was efficient and stress-free. We wanted a tour of the history and culture of the Medina and Abdul made arrangements for a guide at a reasonable price. He also recommended a visit to see the Roman ruins which was amazing. On our first day we arrived tired and a little overwhelmed. Our host kindly took us to a small restaurant with tasty food and we successfully navigated our way back to the Dar! If we had any questions Abdul and his staff were always available to help. …",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,5,Service above and beyond !,"Being a frequent traveller who had stayed at various hotels in more than 30 different countries, i must say Dar Hafsa offered the most awesome and memorable stay. I stayed in Dar Hafsa together with my girlfriend for 3D2N in December. One of the main highlights of the hotel is the element of personal touch.The owner and staffs of the hotel are all very amicable and go the extra mile for service. Their excellent customer service was apparent the moment we arrived in Fes. Having arrived at the Medina at ~1am due to a flight delay, a kind staff (Soufyane) from the hotel took the trouble to fetch us from the main gate of the medina so as to ensure our safety. The owner of the hotel is very proactive in ensuring we get the best experience in Fes, constantly giving us great…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,5,"If I can, I would totally rate this awesome place 10 stars out of 5 with no hesitation !!","Efficient, thoughtful and dedicated, the owner and 2 of his staff (Soufyane & Mohammed) have put in their heart and soul to ensure that the guests feel comfortably at home and have indeed went FAR beyond my expectation in terms of providing that personal touch! For instance, I have arrived late in the midnight due to a flight delay yet Soufyane has made extra effort to bring us from the blue gate of Fes right to the hotel. Dar Hafsa is well situated at the heart of Fes Medina and the decoration is beautiful! Fes is a city that has many narrow streets which may be daunting for many tourists to navigate but the staff have helped ease this worry of mine and make sure that I get to my destination or my plan for the day without having to fret over them too much. For instance,…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Right in the center of Medina,We stayed in Fez was just one evening en route from Merzouga to Chefchaouen. I don’t remember the names but the owner and the young guy were very welcoming. They picked us from the outer gates of the Medina to the Riad. We didn’t have a bus ticket to Chefchaouen so the younger guy took us to the CTM bus stop and showed us how to get there. With out his help we would have struggled to find the place early next morning. Regarding the room we had a queen and a single bed. Very spacious and clean and had Wi-Fi. I missed the breakfast since our bus was at 7am. I wish I would have stayed another day but oh well next time. If you looking for a place then look no further.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2017,5,Home away from home,"Convenient located in the heart of Medina, 10-15 minutes walk from Bab Bou Jeloud, the Dar is a true gem. Our two nights stay at the place was lovely and the staff and the owner Abdul Karim are warm and kind people, very welcoming and accommodating in making your stay enjoyable. They arranged for a taxi from the airport and picked us up from the Blue Gate. We were welcomed with the traditional Moroccan mint tea. Abdul recommended a really authentic restaurant for our first night and arranged a tour guide for the following day. You feel among friends here as him, his family and the stuff spend time with their guests telling stories and sharing valuable tips about Fes and other places in Morocco. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing. On our last night me and mom…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,"Fantastic Hospitality, Strongly Recommended","We trusted the many TripAdvisor reviews for this place and it really paid off. The entire staff are incredibly welcoming, and the hotel itself is cosy, clean and absolutely beautiful. The house has been in the owner's generation for over a hundred years, and the building itself is six centuries old, but constantly renovated. Beds are comfortable, single arrangements and the facilities are simple - what makes Dar Hafsa five stars for us was the staff, who go truly above and beyond to take care of their guests, and the beautiful cosy character. They prepare amazingly varied and delicious breakfasts (with over ten different dishes!), and go above and beyond to make your staff a welcome one. Some examples: The night I arrived, Mohammed, after picking us up and personally…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,one of the reasons to go back to Morocco,"I can only agree with the previous reviews. The place is enchanted and we'll never forget the staff: the lovely owner, Sofyan, Mohammed and the tour guide Ali, pure entertainment :) we were tempted non to hire a guide but honestly it was 100% worth it. The rooms are clean and finely decorated, the breakfast is a feast for your eyes and palate.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,An amazing place!,"Stayed there for two nights. I arrived in the Fez airport late afternoon, took a taxi arranged through the hotel, and went to one of the gates of the old city. From there an assistant took me to the hotel. I do not know whether I could have got to the hotel if I had not reserved the taxi. It was already dark, and I did not have a local SIM card to connect to the Internet. It cost 150 MAD, but it was worth it. The staff are really helpful, and the old house is just amazing. The room I stayed in was incredible. I highly recommend this place.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Enjoyed a lot!,We stayed at dar Hafsa for 2 nights and we loved it. The room was beautiful and comfortable. On arrival they offered us maroccon famous mint tea - it was fantastic !!

 November 2017,5,Very nice hotel in middle of the medina,"We stayed for two nights in the Dar Hafsa hotel in the middle of the Medina. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We loved the room and the breakfast was delicious. We would definitely come back when we return to Fes. When we booked the room they send us a phone number to call when we would arrive to Fes. We decided not to call, but had troubles finding it. The location on google maps was not fully accurate and it’s easy to get lost in the Medina. Luckily locals were helpful to point us in the right direction. So don’t be stubborn and call them when you arrive!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,"Great Location, Amazing Hospitality",Seriously the entire hospitality team here is out of this world. They were beyond friendly to going out of their way to help us with things such as handwashed laundry and helping to buy us fruit in the market. I honestly have never encountered this level of hospitality and kindness at any other accommodations - they really went above and beyond. The riad is also in a good location in the middle of things and the room was nice and comfortable and the interior decor is gorgeous.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Home away from Home,"Located in the Medina, maybe a 15 min walk from the gate Bab Boujouloun - so get a true sense of life in Fes. Hosts, Mohammed and Abdul Karem, are so friendly - helping to find guides of the Medina, to arranging dinner, and even escorted us to buy a bus ticket so we would not get lost. They make sure you have the best time in Fes and are comfortable in the riad. Beautifully decorated - tile and painted woodwork throughout the riad. Comfortable and rustic place to stay while visiting Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Perfect place to stay in Fes,"I stayed for 4 nights.So welcoming, it was a pleasure to be part of the family! Everyone spoke great English and were really interesting to talk to. Convenient location in the medina, down a quiet back street away from the main areas. Fabulous breakfast. Lovely roof terrace. I would thoroughly recommend this place.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Another level of Hospitality!!,"everything is great: rooms,bathroom,terrace..but 5 stars here are just not enough to express hospitality of the family that owns the place.

More than recommended :)",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,"Beyond excellent, true hospitality","My boyfriend and I stayed one night at Dar Hafsa but we wished we could of extended our stay with them! From the moment we got off the taxi at the blue gate, I knew we were in good hands when one of the staff introduced himself (with a picture ID!) and walked us to the hotel. The property was very clean with a homey feel and I fell in love with the terrace. The owner gave so many great advices and tips for our stay in Fes and beyond. Unfortunately we couldn’t extend our stay bc the property was full the next night, but the owner took care of us and booked us a different property. True hospitality!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Terrific!!,"We are really happy with our stay at Dar hasfa. Mr Abdul Karim and his family made us feel very welcome and Sufyan who worked there was always ready with a helping hand.

Would definitely stay here again!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Good ratings justified!,"My friends and I had a great time in Fez, and I highly recommend those intending to visit to go stay at Dar Hafsa. When you’ve been travelling for quite a bit, it’s the little things that makes a difference between a good experience and a bad one. I’m happy to say that at Dar Hafsa, you will get only the best treatment from Abdul Karim and his family. They will help you with all your travel needs in Fez, and even beyond. The rooms are clean and tastefully furnished, and the setting of the place is intimate enough for you to feel at home. Breakfast is always generous and filling, and I feel bad that we couldn’t finish everything on offer. It’s just too much to eat! I highly appreciate Abdul Karim’s help in getting us a guide around Fez, definitely the highlight of our stay…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Home away from home!!!,"There are not enough words to describe how fabulous my experience with Dar Hafsa was. From the very beginning I got a taste of the warmth and excellent service they provide. While booking online they were super responsive and extremely helpful, even pointing out the cheapest and most convenient way to get there. They are constantly looking out for your and your best interest. When I arrived at the gate of the Médina Abdul Karim was waiting for me with a smile. He walks you to the house, even though it’s a short walk through some of the main streets, so very easy to find. They welcome you with the traditional Moroccan tea and make you feel right at home. I was traveling solo, and as a woman there are always things to watch out for. But Abdul and his family took care of me as if I…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,So welcoming!,"I can't recommend highly enough, from the help given by email beforehand booking a taxi from the airport, advice on restaurants to eat, places to visit, a fabulous breakfast each morning, accompanying me to buy dates and nuts at a recommended stall so I got a fair price, we couldn't have been better cared for, like staying in a family home. The beds are really comfortable, everything clean, beautifully decorated - the hand painted doors particularly impressive. Great location at end of alley so very quiet too. Thank you! This is an absolute gem - don't hesitate to choose - we felt so safe here.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2017,5,Weekend visit to Fez,"Very much a family run guest house. The staff went the extra mile for us all the time. This little gem, hidden at the end of an alley, makes this a superb place to stay. Can not recommend Dar Hafsa too highly.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2017,5,Fabulous Service!,"My husband and I stayed at Dar Hafsa for a week. We had the most amazing service and assistance from Abdul and his staff. We had so many questions and the staff had all of our answers! Staff assisted us with getting to and from restaurants, purchasing snacks, assisting with mailing our postcards, carrying our bags up and down the stairs, and arranging a guide for a tour of the Medina. The breakfast was awesome. And, we had mint tea in numerous places in Morocco, and Dar Hafsa had the best tasting tea of all of them! We had to work during our stay, and the internet was stable and allowed us to complete what we needed to do. Thank you to Abdul and his staff for a wonderful stay!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2017,5,Warm and Friendly,"Dar Hafsa was warm, cozy and welcomed us with open arms. When we first got there, I was amazed with the beautiful decorations. The room we stayed in was clean with a soothing atmosphere. The rooftop terrace became a place for us to wind down with mint tea and relax as late afternoon turned into evening, resting our aching legs and feet. Breakfasts were delicious and often carried us all the way our next meal (later lunch/early dinner). Mr. Karim and Soufyane were so friendly and accommodating. They helped us, like giving us tips while exploring the old city, connecting us to other locals for tours and such, accompanying us to buy bus tickets (we didn't even know there was a sales office near the old city), or simply talking to us. I'm glad we chose Fes as our first city to…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2017,5,Wonderful stay,"We spent 2 nights in this Riad, and had a lovely time. The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. When we relaxed in the public area, Soufyan and Mohammad would talk to us, that is so nice.

 September 2017,5,I Would Like To Live Here,"My friends and I were a little nervous about staying in the Old Medina, but the staff at Dar Hafsa were the nicest people we've had to pleasure of meeting so far in Morocco. We were met at the gate and shown the way to the hotel by a young man who made sure we felt comfortable and informed us of useful facts as we navigated the streets. Dar Hafsa was kind enough to let us check in early, even though our room was not ready due to other guests checking out, but they made us feel right at home! They took our bags and showed us to their terrace balcony and brought us mint tea and sat with us sharing stories of the city, it was a wonderful conversation. Once our room was ready our bags were brought up for us. The Manager arranged a tour guide to meet us the next morning to ensure…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2017,5,"Cosy, quiet dar in the middle of the Medina","This dar is a safe haven in the middle of tge busy Medina in Fez. It is a little bit of a walk from the Blue Gate and you cannot rely on google maps to get you to the Dar. Ask the hotel to pick you at a designated time so that you dont get lost. The Medina itself is quite busy and loud, but the Dar is in a side alley that keeps it away from the madness. The lobby is cosy and inviting. The best part about the Dar are the hosts. We were met by the night manager Sufian, who was amazing! He helped a lot with all the arrangements, made sure our driver picked us up the next day, gave us highlights about Fez etc. The rooms are small and cozy. The AC works well and the bathroom has a good enough shower. We stayed on the top floor, and our only concern was thet the floor tilted…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2017,5,Excellent!,"I highly recommend Dar Hafsa. The staff (who seemed to be treated as family more than employees) were kind and welcoming. The riad itself is breathtakingly beautiful. The architectural details are stunning and it is kept very clean. The location is perfect. The breakfast was delicious. But, again, what made our stay so wonderful was the owner, his staff and his daughter. They went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and well taken care of. We all shared laughs and great conversation. You cannot go wrong staying at Dar Hafsa! It is like a home away from home. I cannot wait to return some day. I highly recommend!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2017,5,A bit of home abroad,Dar Hafsa is a very recommendable place to stay when visiting Fès. Our days started with a big and yummy breakfast and more than once ended with a mint tea either in the nice common area or on the beautiful roof top terrace. The owner and the staff were very welcoming and helped us to organise several trips (i.e to Meknes). They also had Restaurant recommendations for different price ranges.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2017,5,EXCELLENT!,"The owner Mr. Abdul Karim was a very gracious, relaxed, and welcoming host. The entire staff was friendly and a lot of fun to talk to. All of the staff speak many languages! This 600 year old family riad was gorgeous and sparkling clean. My mother became slightly I'll during our time in Fez and the whole staff helped us get proper food and medicine for her, and allowed her to rest as long as she needed.

 August 2017,5,Great place and great people,"The first time when i reached Fes, i was scared a bit because of the things i heard about this area before and its complicated identity. However all people who work in this beautiful hotel make their guests more relax and feel safe. Whenever and whatever you need, they help you. Also the hotel is much cleaner and safe than others. Rooms have really nice design and in these rooms you can reach things whatever you need. Everyday, they clean rooms with your permission and if you do not want them to clean room, they do not enter your room for sure.

 August 2017,5,Fabulous Experience,"This was my first visit to Morocco, travelling with a friend. I do not speak French or Moroccan and being a woman I was a little unsure of how to navigate. We arrived late so we missed them at the gate but if we had called they would of returned and met us. I was enchanted the minute we arrived at the front door. In all of my bohemian travels across the globe I have never been greeted so warmly as at Dar Hafsa. Immediately we were put at ease by Abdul, Mohammed, Soufian and Rashida. Dar Hafsa is a hidden pearl nestled inside the medina. Sincere hospitality, authentic artisinal decor and moroccan breakfast. The roof top terrace invites a beautiful panoramic vista of Fes.

 August 2017,4,Friendly and helpful!,"The staff and owner of Dar Hafsa make Fes a more pleasant place to stay. Fes is a difficult place to maneuver inside the median. There are over 9400 small roads!! At Dar Hafsa they will meet you places and also facilitate trips, drivers and people to meet you at the Dar!! This is crucial!! Our room was clean and quiet. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious . But the best thing about the Dar was handing out with the owner and his two assistants Soufian (I made up this spelling!!) and Mohammed!! Be sure to take a day trip to Volubilis!! Most amazing Roman ruins!!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Mr. Kareem gave us great tips as how to plan our short stay the best. We had a great next day with our guide, she took us through the beautiful highlights of the medina. We visited the different artesan quarters and got all the sounds, tastes and smells of the local markets too. The official guides are a bit pricey but absolutely worth it!

 July 2017,5,Most hostile experience in Marroco,"We loved it here! If you know you will go to Fes, try to book this room in advance because there is not a better place where you can stay, and it would be a pity if it is full. The staff is the most friendly you can find and they treat you as if you are a king. Whatever your question is, they will help you, walk with you to the place you are looking for, and make you the best mint tea. Also it is a beatiful morrocan building, 600 years old, you will enjoy every centimeter of this riad. Great roof terrace and wifi.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2017,4,In the heart of the Medina - Fes el Bali - without the chaos,My husband and I stayed in July. We stayed in the double room at the top of the stairs which had windows opening up to the roof top of the old (courtyard house. The place just oozed history - exactly what we wanted. The decor was in keeping with Moroccan style - both colourful and beautiful. We were greeted with a cup of mint tea which soon became a favourite and thanks to Soufyane I can drink at home after being taught how to make it - although I have not mastered the art of getting the froth on top! There was nothing better than sitting in the rooftop area with our mint tea being greeted by the cooler evening breeze after a day touring around in the heat. Wonderful lasting memories.

 July 2017,5,A Welcome Home,"For the student, the intrepid explorer with not quite a lot of cash, or simply those who seek a comfortable place to stay in the commercial chaos that is the Fez medina, Dar Hafsa is the perfect hotel. Situated conveniently in the heart of the medina itself, it is also sufficiently far from the noise of the hustle and bustle of Fassi vendors. Karim, the owner, is a compassionate and above all honest host with a warm smile and plenty of recommendations. He set us up with an excellent tour of the medina and a delicious restaurant near the Blue Gate, both for extremely reasonable prices. I cannot overstate his candidness and evenhandedness—I was never in doubt that Karim did not have our best interests at heart.

Instructions where clear: call the hotel upon arrival and we were told to go to the Blue door of the medina. There we met Abdul Karim who walked us to the hotel. We were warmly received with mint tea and Soufiane helped us with our luggage to our room. We had barely made any plans so our hosts suggested restaurants and that the day after we hire a guide to visit the medina. Our room was just like in the pictures, small but very comfortable and equipped with everything we needed including air conditioning.

 July 2017,5,Great place to stay,I stayed 2 nights with my wife. The owner and those working there were very nice and helpful. What I appreciated most was the owners honesty. Never pushed anything and we had some good conversations. Gave great advice. Called a difficult to find restaurant and had them come pick us up. He even walked us back to the parking lot outside rolling one of the suitcases. I believe he does this because it's good for business which every owner should but I also believe it came from his heart and for those reasons I can recommend staying here . Location is perfect as well.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2017,5,Beautiful Dar in the Fes Medina,"I decided to travel to Morocco by myself with absolutely no plans in mind. Luckily when I arrived in Fes I found Dar Hafsa online and booked two nights not knowing what to expect. A kind man met me at the entrance to the medina and led me through to what seemed like a small hidden house. Once inside the 700 year old home, the beauty was outstanding! The interior is colorfully done in a very old fashion. Rooms are small but efficient, and the best part of this house is definitely the people. The owner welcomed me with open arms and I immediately became friends with the staff. The next two days, the owner had set up so many activities for me and told me the best places to eat without worrying about getting ripped off. I strongly recommend Dar Hafsa for the full experience they…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The room was stunning (the one featured above--I felt like I was in an old Hollywood movie it was so gorgeous), the location was easy to find and accessible, and the hosts were so lovely. You felt like they really wanted you to leave Fes loving everything about it. We wished we could have stayed longer. The only thing I could conveivably think to recommend would be having the possibility (I'm not sure if it would be possible eeeek) to have breakfast on the rooftop because the view was amazing!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

We arrived late at night and had organised with Dar Hafsa,to pick us up at the airport for a fee of 15 euros. We had no hassles in finding our driver (he had a sign bearing my name) and he was polite and spoke passable English. Half an hour later, we pulled up somewhere just within the old part of Fes. There were a couple of young men waiting for us in the drizzle with hoods up, and it all seemed a bit ominous, but we really had nothing to fear - in fact, one of the lads turned out to be the nicest guy we ever met.

Mr. Abdul is the happiest and most helpful man I've met in a long time and consistently went out of his way to make sure that our stay in Fès was as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. He hired a driver to pick us up from the airport, met us at the bab in the middle of the night to walk us to the house and brought us amazing mint tea to help us settle in. The next day, after an enormous and delicious breakfast,he contacted a tourist office to have a guide take us through the medina.

There are two men helping him to keep a 24-hour service and they are happy to offer help or company for trips in the medina.

I then read about Dar Hafsa's central, convenient and very quiet location, it's unmatched hospitality and saw the photos of the spectacular interior. Then when I saw the modest rates, I figured this has got to be the best value in Fez and signed right up! After staying 6 nights at Dar Hafsa, I can attest that all Hafsa's glowing reviews are certainly true. Dar Hafsa has 4 bedrooms but Dar Hafsa's extremely personalized attention to each guest's needs is what sets it apart from all other Fez accommodations. No favor, advice , directions or accompanying was too inconvenient for Mr. Abdul Karim, Soufian and Mohamed. They all immediately…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The mint tea was endless and delicious. We had a triple room. The room was spacious, comfortable, and very clean. The housekeeper is adorable. In sum, I could not stop thinking how much better our experience was than being in a hotel: our stay was very personalized and there was always someone there to help!

After only a few hours we quickly realized Ahmed is a true, genuine gentleman who love Fes deeply and only wants the best for his guests. We only stayed one night as we travelled around Morocco, but even when we were back in Fes and staying at a different riad he helped to arrange things for us. He found the best prices, suggested the best restaurants and overall was so helpful we almost cancelled our other reservation to stay with him again.

 May 2017,5,amazing hotel with a super good price,"i spend four days in Fes for my first morocco trip by myself, as a cheap New yorker, i love place has so much local stuff, same as this hotel showing me the not-poor-local people house's look. It is mystery cover by many stunning display items, it is making a morocco house for me. first of all, if you choosing here to stay, please get them a call or email before you go. For example, my flight was land in 2 am at fes airport, i dont even mention about how hard you get a taxi or car to get there at the day time with some nice price and the driver is not going to get you a trap, i just like talking about if you arrive the gate of the town how can you get your direction of everywhere you would like go... if you do call them, they will send some one to pick you up. Second, this…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2017,5,"Friendly, helpful and great value--best included breakfast we had in Morocco","It was a great basic riad with AC, included breakfast, pick up from the Blue Gate and help arranging a taxi for 429 Dirham. Everyone was very friendly and provided useful directions and food suggestions. Everything was clean and functional and the wifi was great in comparison with the other wifi experiences we had in Morocco. The only negative: the bathroom we had a bit of a strange layout. The toilet, sink and shower faucet were all very close together and shared a common floor. Things didn't seem to drain super well after the shower and the bathroom always had a wet, dark sort of smell. None of this was a dealbreaker though.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2017,3,Basic riad with good location,"This is a small lovely riad with very helpful staff in a good location. The owner comes across as friendly and helpful, but our experience made us very wary of his intentions. On our first day, he asked about our dinner plans. We informed him of a restaurant we intended to visit which he mentioned is good but very expensive to the tune of over 500 dirhams for a meal for 2. He quickly suggested another restaurant (Dar Tajine) which is 140 dirhams per person; not a cheap price in Morocco standard. We thoroughly enjoyed Dar Tajine and think it's well worth it's price, however we later found out the initial restaurant we intended to go to is very moderately priced with a meal for two costing ~150 dirhams. We felt a sense of pettiness with the owner as there is a lack of bath…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2017,5,"Wonderful hospitality, friendly and happy to help.","The owner Ahmed, organised our transfer from airport to Dar. When we arrived we were greeted with the traditional Moroccan Mint tea and given a choice of rooms. Abdel was happy to make recommendations for visits on our stay and arranged for a wonderful guide to show us around the sights of Fes. The room was clean and simple, breakfast was lovely, with attention paid to my food allergies. We could store drinks in the fridge too. The staff were so friendly and fun. We learned a lot about Moroccan culture, education and Mohammed has the sweetest singing voice, giving a rendition of Rai music. Abdel very kindly arranged to buy us a tea pot at a good price and was able to make good recommendations of where to eat and shop. I would strongly recommend you visit and make Dar Hafsa part…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2017,5,Fantastic place and people,Stayed here for 3 nights and everyone couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating. Nothing was too much trouble and Ahmed was the most gracious host. He even helped us by getting some things we wanted and made an effort to look out for things we needed. Rooms were clean and cosy and breakfast was generous and classicky Moroccan. Choose this place!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2017,5,Friendly owner and centrally located in Medina,"We had a pleasant two-night stay here. The owner and other staff members were extremely helpful and assisted us with all our questions and requests. When we required a pharmacy, one staff member even walked us there to ensure we reached it. Breakfast and unlimited mint tea throughout the day is included and delicious. A further note on Fes in general. Please be aware of extremely persuasive carpet salesmen and ensure you do research first! Don't ever feel obliged to buy on the spot. I appreciate this seems like obvious advice, however these salesmen are well rehearsed in persuading tourists (with plenty of complimentary tea thrown in!)",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2017,5,Fantastic service,"We were most impressed with the staff who gave us good advice on all aspects of visiting Fes. They linked us with fabulous tour guides who spoke excellent English and who were very knowledgeable about the history and interests points. Very good breakfast, clean rooms and lovely roof terrace where you can enjoy the mint tea. Also they are extremely friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this Dar Thanks again Dar Hafsa Anna & Marek",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2017,5,Better than home!,"I can't tell you enough about how well we were treated at the Dar. The owner, his son and Sofian did everything they could to make our time in Fes a delight. From dinner reservations to bus tickets to tours as well as tea served whenever we wanted. The house is beautiful and we couldn't stop taking photos. The breakfast is so good and big we only ate 1 other meal the entire day. What great memories we'll have a Fes because of our stay at Dar Hafsa!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2016,5,Perfect stay in Fez medina,"We stayed four nights at this wonderful Dar located deep inside the Fez Medina. It’s a 10-15 minutes’ walk from the gate to the Dar. Miriam and her father, Abdul, are wonderful hosts who do everything they can to make travelers feel at home in their Dar. When we arrived at the medina gate, Abdul was there to meet us and escort us to the Dar. The B&B has only four guest rooms, and you can feel like part of the family after a day or two. We had a twin room upstairs, which was small but adequate for our needs. There is no closet or other place to hang clothes, except a coat tree. The bathroom is tiled and we never ran out of hot water. There is free reliable WiFi. Breakfast is included and is served on the first floor. It is a typical Moroccan breakfast of breads, pancakes,…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2017,5,Best place ever,Dar Hafsa is a great place to sleep while visiting Fes. Located in a very small street only short walk from the main street this is wonderful location for exploring the city. The house is beautiful and the rooms are charming and very clean. Above all the owner Abdul Carim and the Riad's team are very kind and very helpful. Abdul Carim met us in the entrance when we arrived and showed us where to park and the way to the Riad. He gave us lots of advices and great tips and also sent us to one of the best meals we ever had. It was a great and very joyous experience to stay at Dar Hafsa- super recommend!!!!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2017,5,Oasis from the hustle and bustle of medina life,"Dar Hafsa is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Medina life in Fes. Kareem, Sufjan and all the hosts at the Dar were extremely hospitable and friendly. Close to two of the Medina gates, Dar Hafsa caters to guests looking for a taste of Fassi life that has existed for over a millennium. The owner Kareem is more than happy to suggest places of interest to visitors, including official tour guides of the Medina for all your sight-seeing and shopping needs. If that's the route you want to go, Kareem will arrange things for you very quickly: within minutes of our arrival, he had arranged for someone to lead us through the maze of the medina to a delicious dinner. Jump headfirst into Fes and feel comfortable that Dar Hafsa's accommodations and staff will meet your needs in this…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2017,5,A perfect place,"I spend 2 nights at Dar Hafsa. Everything was perfect. Room are beautiful and bed are really confortable. Roof terrasse is quiet and you'll have a beautiful view. M.

Feel like you're home.I definitely recommend it.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,Fabulous stay!,"This is a lovely property with the most hospitable staff I've ever met! Our room was clean, cozy and quiet. The breakfast was more than ample and served with lots of lovely Moroccan coffee. We enjoyed several wonderful meals at places that Abdul recommended. One night he even walked us to the place and made sure that we ordered what we wanted as we don't speak Arabic. He also organized a great guide for us to tour the medina one day and a safe driver to take us to the mountains the next. We enjoyed many cups of mint tea as we got to know the friendly people who work here. We're so happy we choose to spend three night here and are certain you will be too!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,"Great hospitality, great place to stay, great service, great location","We were given extensive instructions on how to get to this lovely place to stay. The location is in the heart of fes el Bali, the old city. It is located 30 seconds off a busy lane, so is out of the way enough for there not to be a constant babble under your window. They have furnished a lovely terrace which has a great and quite expansive view of the surrounding area, which develops into lovely views of the minarets lit up at night. The hospitality starts before you even get to dar Hafsa, as they send a guide to bring you to the nearest gate for free. The guide will be one of the two receptionists or the owner himself. They will give you lots of advice on the way, and make you feel comfortable as you go through the winding roads of fes el Bali to dar hafsa. They also offer…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,Loved this Riad,"Can't say enough wonderful things about this Riad! The owner is fantastic, making our short stay in Fes memorable and worry free! They took care of everything - including arranging for a guide to show us around the city. Ali made sure the guide took care of us. For dinner, we overheard another couple compliment Ali about his recommendation for their meal the night before. We asked him about it - he not only took care of making the reservations, but also had someone pick us up from the Riad so that we didn't get lost on the way! Highly recommend this Riad - you won't find better service or price anywhere else!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,Wonderful place with warmhearted owners,From the first moment we felt like home. After a warmhearted welcome we got served a fresh mint tea. We had a really good feeling from the first moment. We arrived in the evening and Sofian the friendliest guy we met in Marocco offered to order some food because we haven't had dinner at this time. The room was really beautiful and clean. The view from the roof terrace was spectacular. The breakfast in the morning was really good and we were missing nothing. Just wonderful. All in all the best stay in our entire time in Marokko. Thanks to all the nice people from Dar Hafsa We will be back for sure Roger&Alex,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,Fantastic riad in the middle of the Medina!,"This was my second time staying at this riad - and I would come back again and again! This is a beautiful property that is over 600 years old, but has been fully renovated and is absolutely splendid to stay in. It's in a quiet alley in the medina - a short walk away from all the hustle and bustle. The owner met us at the gate when we arrived and was extremely helpful throughout our stay. The rooftop terrace is splendid and it was the best included breakfast that we've had in Morocco. Also, they will make you mint tea whenever you want! The shower became hot very quickly (unlike a lot of the places that we have stayed). I would definitely recommend Dar Hafsa to anyone coming to Fes!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,Will only get better but already wonderful,"I have had a lovely time here. Although I was only able to stay two nights, with the generous assistance of my host, Abdul, I was able to pack a lot into my short time in Fes. This is a riad that will only improve with time as the owner's plans become reality. Finishing touches to the roof terrace will complete this little gem of a place. In the meantime you have a charming, beautifully restored raid - clean and quiet on a side street of the medina. Just steps away from the bustle of the souqs, this is the best of both worlds. To clarify the amenities and hotel style section below - one may smoke on the roof terrace. Like staying at the home of an old friend, the entire staff go out of their way (especially Abdul) to make your stay memorable. I can't say enough about the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,"Great people, great place",Stayed for a week mid-march 2017. The owner and the two staff were very welcoming and helpful. They give very good tips on bargaining and prices for local shops and tours - though I found I wasn't very good at this. I also got on very well with the other guests and I think this is encouraged by the friendly nature of the riad. The riad is very easy to get to from bab boujloud but not so close to the main street that it's loud or crowded the second you step outside. I will definitely be staying here again if I have the chance,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,Highly recommended!!!,"My partner and I stayed 3 nights at Dar Hafsa. It was our most memorable stay on our entire Morocco trip. Abdul, Soufyane and Mohammed took best care of us, they always made sure that we got the best out of every day. Also they speak very good English and we always felt welcome to just sit and talk with them over many cups of delicious mint tea. The riad is easy to reach (10min walk from the blue gate), there is a local hammam to experience, the rooms are big, clean and warm due to a heater and ample blankets. We could not have asked for more and can only recommend Dar Hafsa to every visitor of Fès!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2016,5,awesome riad with great people!,"I stayed in that riad for 3 nights during November. I was truly amazed by the spirit, hospitality and friendliness of the owner and the other people there. The riad is absolutely beautiful, in a central location, exceptionally clean and the owners do everything needed to make sure that customers get the best experience of the riad and of Fes. Be prepared for the breakfast, as it is delicious and massive. If you take the tour, make sure in advance, what you will cover, in how much time and what the price will be as he s quite deceiving and doesn't stick to the price proposed by the riad. I definitely recommend both Fes and this Riad for anyone.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2017,5,What a gem!,"Dar Hafsa was wonderful. It was a gem of a hotel and we enjoyed every moment of our experience. We arrived an hour later than expected via ONCF (at 1:30am), and Soufiane met us at Bab Boujloud to take us to the hotel. We had an early morning tour the next day and he awoke early to prepare our breakfast, too. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, it felt like home. Abdul, the owner, was equally amazing. Always willing and wanting to help for our sake. He truly wanted us to have a good experience in Morocco and Fes. If you're in need of a guide, just ask. He can call the tourist bureau to request one. Knowing from experience, it's cheaper to book tours locally than through, for example, viator because in Morocco, everything is negotiable. And haggle,…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2017,5,Wonderful experience!!,Abdul was the best host! He took care of us from pickup to the private tour to the desert to making sure we enjoyed it upon arrival back to Fes!

Thanks to you all at Dar Hafsa.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2017,5,Simply amazing,"I couldn't recommend this guesthouse anymore!! The service was excellent from start to finish! The staff went out of their way to make our stay excellent, whether this was hand drawing maps, recommending restaurants or organising tour guides for the medina. It's definitely worth calling the hotel once you arrive in Fez, as they can arrange with you a meeting point (rather than you trying to head into the medina and searching!). The rooms were really well kept and the free breakfast was a spectacular spread! The view from the roof top is also a great feature!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2017,5,Made fes easy from start to finish!,"We had a perfect stay at Dar Hafsa! Thank you to all the lovely staff; for picking us up from the airport (and waiting for our delayed plane), the lovely mint tea on tap, helpful directions and warm hospitality. The hotel is splendid and our room was large, beautifully decorated and comfortable. We also appreciated the tour guide and dinner recommendation, and never felt pushed at any point. We'd suggest other guests use a tour guide as well (we had a particularly short stay here) as it made exploring so easy, relaxing and included so much. The breakfast is also amazing and we were lucky to get portable breakfast for our early morning flight. Many thanks and we hope to return! Would highly recommend to all travellers.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2017,5,Unbelievable hospitality and generosity,"My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights at Dar Hafsa and had a truly incredible and memorable experience in Fes thanks to Abdullah and his family. Where to begin? First off, the building is beautiful and wonderfully decorated. Our room was close to the roof for sunset views and very cozy. Abdul arranged a guide to take us on a tour of the medina and we had an amazing time exploring the city. Breakfast was the best ever, with 10 different kinds of bread/pastries served each morning with coffee, yogurt, orange juice, cheese, jam, and honey. So good! We didn't need lunch until late in the afternoon. Most importantly, everyone we interacted with (including other guests!) were warm, welcoming, friendly, and hospitable.

 January 2017,5,Fantastic hospitality!,"My Husband and I just spent 2 nights at this lovely hotel/riad. We were greeted at the door by the owner and served a delicious breakfast upon arrival - generous and warm. We were then guided to the best restaurants and tour guide.

We highly recommend this hotel for an authentic, hospitable and welcoming experience of Fes :) Thank you to the Dar Hafsa team!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2017,5,Ideal way to enjoy Morocco!,"I can't say enough about Abdulkarim and his staff. They made sure our time in Fez was unbelievable. The property itself is gorgeous, from the rooms to the roof terrace, and right in the heart of Fez. Breakfast is a must. He set up an amazing tour of the city and always made sure we were in good hands. Most importantly, he organized the highlight of our whole time in Morocco: a trip to Merzouga and the sand dunes of the Sahara. We hadn't planned on going but after a chat over tea we decided we couldn't miss it and he took it from there. For a reasonable price we ended up staying a night in the desert and another near Ait Ben Haddou with a private driver and lots of activities. I can't thank him enough! And on that note, I also want to highlight his amazing staff. They were all…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2017,5,Lovely and intimate place to stay,"The hotel consists of a large traditional house (Dar) in the old town of Fez (Medina). To get to the hotel, either contact the hotel beforehand or go through the Bab Boujloud gate and walk for fifteen minutes and turn right (not left as indicated by Google Maps) when you see a small sign with the number 7. The hotel has only four rooms, which makes the service more personal and intimate. Abdul, Mohammed and Sofian are excellent people. Generous breakfast, from 9 to 11 am. Highly recommended, espeacially for romantic couples. For eating, I would recommend a place turning left just before the metioned gate coming from the hotel, named Chez Hakim, excellent food.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2017,5,"Amazing Host, Excellent Riad","After booking Dar Hafsa online, my partner and I arrived in Fes by car and parked in a nearby parking garage. We didn't know it, but someone at the garage had contacted the owner of Dar Hafsa and he ran to find us and guide us from the parking garage to the Riad. The owner and his staff were equally eager to please throughout our two night stay, making arrangements for dinner, a guide around Fes, and purchasing goods in the Medina. All of his recommendations were excellent. He even went the extra mile to make sure we had breakfast when we left. He is very dedicated and proud of his clean and handsome Riad. Strongly recommended.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2017,5,Wonderful stay!,"We stayed at this riad in Fes for two nights and had a great time. The riad is beautifully decorated and our room on the top floor was very comfortable. The view from the Terrace is wonderful. Coming from the quiet desert, it was great to have a friendly host feel like a friend and help orientate us to the busy medina. Staff helped us feel at home and were always happy to sit, drink a cup of tea and chat. They had great food recommendations and knew exactly how we should try to tackle our very short one day stay in Fes. Highly recommended!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Charming riad,"I strongly recommend Dar Hafsa, located in the heart of the medina but in a peaceful side passage. It's a charming beautifully remodelled riad, the place is very nicely decorated and the staff is great and very helpful, they gave us good advice and tips. Breakfast was a real feast, with great variety.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Good place to stay in medina,The host was very friendly and helped us navigate the medina. The riad is in the middle of the old city so very good location. Room is clean and nice. Breakfast was plentiful. I would recommend if you are staying in fes.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Home away from home,"My husband and I spent two nights in the Dar Hafsa, and enjoyed our stay so much that we extended our stay by three more days. Karim is an incredibly gracious host, who made us feel welcome and comfortable in a very unique and foreign environment. He helped us arrange several different day trips- one exploring the medina, one exploring the outskirts of the old city, one to the Atlas Mountains and one to Volubilis- and we found the medina to be an excellent base for these day trips. The riyad is located just off the main 'strip' in the medina, which is an incredible place to explore. There are dozens of alleys and winding lanes to explore within meters of the riyad, and it's definitely worth hiring a guide (as recommended by Karim) to help you navigate! The building itself…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,The perfect place to stay in Fes,"TripAdvisor reviews led me here, and I was not disappointed. Dar Hafsa is a beautiful small hotel in the heart of the medina. The owner Karim is very welcoming and friendly; he is more than happy to help you arrange tours of the of city, as well as any transportation you may need. He assisted us in day trips to Volubilis and the Atlas Mountains, and we were very satisfied. Also serves a great Moroccan breakfast. Doubt you'll be disappointed.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Outstanding Experience,"Having read previous reviews on Trip Advisor, I booked my stay here and from the moment I was met at the airport, I knew I had made the right decision The proud owner Kahrim treats each of his guest with outstanding hospitality He shares his passion for his city with his guests and you truly are made to feel like family Nothing was too much trouble for him or for his staff Soufyane and Mohamed I was organised with an outstanding guide Hamid, given recommended restaurants, sights and tours Your stay hyere will be a hgighglight and I will be sorry to depart",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Wonderful hotel in the Medina,"Dar Hafsa offered exceptional hospitality during my stay; the owner and the staff were very accommodating and went out of their way to assist me with securing an official tour guide and providing guidance and advice with regards to navigating the medina in Fes. The owner made every effort to assist the other guests and always welcomed you back with a smile. The breakfast was more than fulfilling with fruits, several varieties of bread and baked goods, jam, honey, orange juice and Moroccan tea. Highly recommended for those visiting Fes for the first time.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,"Highly recommended, would go again","Dar Hafsa is the best place I've stayed in Morocco so far, and I'd venture to say one of the best guest houses I've stayed in while traveling anywhere. The owner, Karim and the entire staff were incredibly helpful, and available for any questions we had and gave some excellent recommendations. Karim came out to where our taxi from the train station dropped us off, and walked us to Dar - which was quite unexpected, and turned out to be very helpful (if you don't have a phone, you could ask the taxi driver to call him). I definitely got the impression that they really cared about ensuring we had the best experience in the city, walking us around to a few places (street food, cabs when we were leaving), providing recommendations for dinner and so on. They served mint tea anytime…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,One of the best I've ever stayed in,"The service in this small riad is some of the best, if not the best I've ever experienced. The room was superb, mint tea and breakfast delicious, and the owner and his team not only told me everywhere to visit and eat in Fes, but essentially helped plan the rest of my Morocco holiday for me, without me ever asking them - amazing. Sofiane, the one who stays during the night, is also a legend. Not just for this incredible price but for any price, would definitely recommend, 10/10.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Family riaad in medina Fes,"We spent 2 days and 2 nights at Dar Hafsa in Old City Fes. The owner and staff are the best hosts a guest could ask for. They treated us to mint tea, breakfast, organized our tours, and showed us where to buy the best souveniers to suit our needs. Highly recommend this place to travelers looking to experience the medina. Excellent rooftop views of the medina, too! Hope to return someday soon!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,We had a wonderful time at Dar Hafsa!The hosts were very welcoming and had many great suggestions for us during our stay,The home is very nice with beautiful craftmanship. We enjoyed mint tea many times a day and loved the big breakfast each morning. The entire staff was welcoming and went above and beyond the entire time. They set us up with great local tour guides for the medina and the mountains. They also suggested very good restaurants and shops to ensure we didnt pay too much for things we wanted to purchase. I had a great stay and plan to come back again. 10/10 and hope to be back soon!!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2016,5,Great place to stay in Fez,"Dar Hafsa is a very nice place to stay at in Fez. It is close to the center of the Medina, but very quiet when you desire some rest. Karim, Souffiane and Mohammed are fantastic hosts and gave us a warm welcome and great support and advice throughout our trip. Whenever we needed some help or the route to a place the hosts would kindly draw a map, walk with us or arrange a pickup. The room itself is warmly decorated, very clean and the bed is super comfortable. The breakfast is the most extensive we have seen and tastes really good. I would truly advise anyone to go here when you want to stay in Fez.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2016,5,Lovely riaad in old city Fes,"We spent 2 nights in this riaad, and i would definitely return. We arrived almost at midnight by train, the hotel gave clear instructions of where to go. We were met at the blue gate by Soufiyen who walked us the short walk to the hotel as cars cannot fit on the small streets. The rooms were a good size and the place was absolutely lovely. Breakfast was a delicious spread of various breads made by the hotel, with cheeses jams, honey. The staff were warm and friendly, and even showed me how to make the traditional Moroccan mint tea! We met the owner who was very welcoming and went out of his way to accommodate us. As an example, when we happened to mention to him what specific items we wanted to buy from the market nearby, he offered to come with us in the pouring rain to…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,3,"Nice place, skip the tour","The guesthouse is clean and well located, right off one of the main roads in the Medina. The breakfast is quite nice and the staff are helpful. Do not take the recommended tour. It's way overpriced and just visits shop after shop, followed by an expensive lunch (which I opted out of). I ended the tour about 2 hours early.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2016,5,Familiar hotel and welcoming staff,This is a beautiful hotel with really nice staff.

 November 2016,5,the personal touch,"Staying in Dar Hafsa was an absolute pleasure. The house is beautiful- lovely traditional tiling and painted wood, with lovely views. The breakfast is out of this world, with an incredible variety of items. We never managed to eat all the types of bread/pastry in one morning, but I recommend you try different things each time, as they are all delicious. Best of all, the owner and the staff were so incredibly friendly and helpful, all spoke good English (along with a dizzying array of other European languages!) and knew the local area well. There was always someone there to answer questions or make suggestions. On a desert tour before we arrived my mother's suitcase had been accidentally taken by another person on the tour and the owner was amazingly helpful helping us get…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2016,5,"Wonderful Stay, Friendly Staff",We stayed two nights at Dar Hafsa and had a wonderful time. When we arrived in the evening we were met with smiles and mint tea. The staff was extremely helpful and we had a great time conversing with them during breakfast which was a wonderful feast of breads and spreads with orange juice and coffee or mint tea. Our room was clean and comfortable and the shower nice and warm. We enjoyed spending time on the roof top terrace looking over the medina. Overall a great experience near the middle of the medina. We would highly recommend it!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2016,5,Like Coming Home,"From the moment we stepped into this Riad to the moment we stepped out, we were accommodated for to the furthest extent! Comparatively to Marrakech, the Medina here in Fes is much larger, with many MANY more streets. It's pretty daunting, and it would have been easy to get overwhelmed and not explore the city as much as we did without the help of our host! We were given HONEST advice, wonderful dining and tour recommendations, and friendly employees of the Riad helped us get from place to place. It was a perfect visit!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2016,5,Very accommodating,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Dar Hafsa. The owner was welcoming and extremely helpful in recommending restaurants and a tour guide for the day.

 November 2016,5,Very Helpful,"The best part of this place is the people, Abdul and his family/staff.

Beyond that the place is authentic and charming (also clean) and the breakfast substantial.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2016,5,Lovely Dar with awesome service,"We stayed in this hotel, a lovely dar in the Medina, for 3 nights. From the first time we received a very warm welcome from the owner and his staff. Starting with the food, breakfast was tasty and large enough for not feeling hungry for the next few hours. Moving to service, the owner and his staff were really helpful, recommended tour guides, restaurants, places to shop and arranged our transportation to the airport. Our room was comfortable, clean and quite, and with strong WiFi connection, that are all you need to have a pleasant stay. Not to mention, the polite, amiable and friendly staff of the hotel (Soufyane and Mohamed) who were excellent professionals and with whom we spent considerable time chatting. Highly recommended for any sort of trip!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,5,"Family run, comfortable stay close to Blue Gate in Fes","Dar Hafsa gave me a authentic taste of Moroccan hospitality. The proprietor and his staff gave me a warm welcome even for just one night. He helped me grab a salad and showed me the blue gate and madrassa areas in Medina. His honesty and warmth made a difference in feeling welcomed in otherwise hustle and bustle of the merchant culture. I need to spend more time in Fes to fully experience the the confluence of artisan, cultural and historical aspects of the city next time.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,5,Lovely Riad With Lovely Staff,"We arrived Oct 12, and were met at the train station with a driver we had arranged in advance.

We were suppose to stay 2 nights but had to leave early after 1 night and we had a wonderful breakfast and a great nights sleep.

 October 2016,5,Very nice place to stay,"Stay two nights at this riad. The riad was not easy to find as it is located in Medina. Have to pass long and very crowded way. I was greeted by the host in front of the Blue gate and public parking was near blue gate. I traveled several Morocan Medina, Fes, Chefchaouen, Rabat, Tangier, Meknes...and found that riads located in old medina are very old private houses and surrounding area and outside looking is not so clean and sometimes dirty.However, when you go inside the building you can find totally different looking. Dar Hafsa was the same, The room is clean with nice decorations. Also, the host recommend me a good dinner restaurants, one near the blue gate and the other one is in Medina, I really had nice dinner with reasonable price. Breakfast was really fantastic and…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,5,OUR BEST STAY IN MOROCCO!!,"We were in Morocco for 2 weeks this October, and stayed in 6 different cities. We had never stayed in a Riad or B & B type thing before so not sure what to expect. But this Riad def. exceeded our expectations. After a long flight, train ride, and then taxi, we finally arrived in at the Medina gate in Fez. Our taxi driver called the Riad and Abdul came to meet us at the gate (thank goodness bc we would not have been able to find the place without him! We were welcomed like family with a refreshing glass of mint tea. Room was small but clean, wifi good strength, and shower nice and hot.

Rooms are quaint with traditional style decorations.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2016,5,Nice owners and clean rooms,Nice owners they recommend my friend and I a nice tour guide ( it was 400 drh - 2ppl) - better to get a guide tho. Its impossible walking around alone! Medina is such a maze. Bathroom and room was small but has everything! Bathroom was very clean. Nice and huge breakfast - American style 주인이 친절해요. 워낙 메디나가 미로 수준이라서 길 찾기가 어려운데 택시 내리는 곳에서 픽업 해주셨어요! (아 픽업신청했었는데 150디르함 / 15유로 였습니다 굉장히 쎈 가격입니다...그냥 가까운 택시 공항에서 잡으시면 10디르함에 가세요 ㅜㅜ) 가이드 투어도 신청했는데 나쁘지 않앗어용. 가격이 쎄긴 했는데... 조식도 많이 줍니다 빵이랑 치즈 잼 등등 줘요~,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,4,3nights in Fes,"An amazing little local houses,very beautiful entrance and decor. The breakfast was lots of Moroccan local breads, olives,eggs, honey cheese & coffee the only problem was breakfast was not served till 9.00. We did go down early and we were still served. Would defiantly recommended arranging to be collect at airport specially if you arrive at night as you would not find the riad easily. The only negative point is the noise you hear everything that is happing in the house but for the price it was spotless and very convenient for a short stay. Do not bother with the guid you can managed most of the main attractions in Fes on your own with out being hassled.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,5,3 nights at dar hafsa,"We've been 3 nights at riad dar hafsa and it's been a very good experience. Is located inside of the Fez Medina and is not easy to find to find it for the first time if you dont know how to move inside. Karim, the owner, waited for us at the main gate of the Medina, bab boujloud, and he accompanied us to the riad. Its a little 4 room hotel, very nice decorated and with everything you need, you will feel very comfortable there and even more with the staff. They try to help you all the time and they gave us many good advices about what to do, what to visit and even what to eat inside the Medina.

At first it is hard to find but you'll manage - if needed with a little help. The main entrance is spacious and beautifully decorated. The chambers are also in style with nice carpets, lighting and other decorations. Breakfast is huge and delicious and the staff very helpful. All in all a highly recommended place!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,5,Great stay. Definitely recommended,Right in the middle of the medina and super hosts. You will enjoy your stay guaranteed.

Relax on the roof terrace looking over the city.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,4,"Rooms Amazing, Staff great, owner sketchy","The hotel is gorgeous and in a great location in the medina (old part of Fes). The owner is sketchy. When you get there he is very kind and seems trustful. He explains how everyone has a piece of the pie, so be careful to not seek help in Fes - which is true. 100%. Everyone will get a cut of what you purchase, even if you ask someone in the street - they will take you there personally and you'll be charged extra so they can get paid. Even if you hire a professional, they will take you to only certain shops where they will get a ""piece"" of the price. You just have to keep in mind, ""is it worth the price for you."" Some things were worth it to me and still very inexpensive. MOST things can get a 1/2 of the price and they're still making a huge profit. Promise. When bargaining, go…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2016,5,In the Heart of the Medina with incredible staff,"We stayed here for two nights and had a great time. The staff is so kind and helpful, all with great English and French. Abdule El Karim stayed in touch with us before the trip to Fes and gave a lot of good advices, Soufyane helped us with basic Arabic and supplied us with an endless stream of fresh mind tea. The guesthouse (Dar) is a small, beautifully furnished house in the heart of the Medina. Easy to find from the Blue Gate and close to the main sights. Our room was clean and comfortable. We are definitely going to stay here again on our next visit to Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2016,5,Excellent Hospitality in the Heart of the Medina,"Our 4 night stay at this riad made our stay in Fes so much more enjoyable! The rooms are clean and away from the chaos of the main streets in the medina. We were so impressed by the genuine hospitality of Abdul, his daughter & Soufyane!

Thank you for the wonderful hospitality!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2016,5,A great chilled out place,"Right in the middle of the old Medina, right in the heart of it all.

 September 2016,5,Felt like home,"I had such a nice stay at the Dar Hafsa, everyone was very nice and always attentive that everything was good for us. I am very happy and very satisfied that we chose this place for our stay in Fes. Sofiel was great, very helpful and a wonderful person.

He picked us up from our driver's location and lead us right to our accommodations. The worker, Soufyone, was an unbelievable person with the greatest personality. He was always willing to do anything for us and had nothing but helpful comments about what to see, where to eat, and where to go next. I will miss our mint tea and conversations before bed! Our room was very cute and very clean. The rooftop terrace was lovely and a great place to relax from the crazy medina.

We felt like we were at home right from the very beginning and it seems like all the staff pride themselves on giving the best service possible. It was in an excellent location and while the room was clean and the rooftop view was amazing, what made this stay memorable was Soufyone. The owner Abdul Kareem was really nice and helpful but we spent the most time talking with his worker Soufyone. He was such a kind hearted and friendly young man and he really made this stay special. I hope everyone that comes to visit has a chance to sit down and have mint tea with him because that certainly made our trip to Fez.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

A beautiful man with a gorgeous heart soufyane the gentleman who works there was very attentive to all our needs and a lovely gentleman !

The house itself is beautifully decorated with local furnishings and ornaments, and our double room was comfortable and well air conditioned, which makes for a very welcome break from the heat and bustle of fés. The owners and soufyane who works here are polite, generous, friendly and helpful. They make a fantastic breakfast that will set you up for your inevitably busy days exploring fés and its surrounds. They were very helpful in organising tours, we did the tour of the medina and a day trip to nearby voloubilis, moula idriss and meknes. Yes, people will try to sell you things along the way but that's Morocco and you can just politely say no.

 August 2016,5,Two nights in Dar Hafsa.,"We spent very nice two nights at Dar Hafsa. The location is very convenient, just close to main medina street, which helped a lot to get orientated. Abdul Kharim and Soufyane was very kind and helped us with everything we needed, such as sightseeing in Fes and other things we asked for, all with consideration our budget and no pressure to go for expensive guided tours. The room was nice and clean and breakfast was a very tasty Moroccan style served. When we booked the Dar we received an email with information and phone numbers on how to get to the Dar. We called the numbers given in the email and was guided by the owner of the Dar on how to get there and if we wanted we could get picked up by someone.

 August 2016,5,Your Home in Fes <3 (but DO the tour),"We spontaneously booked our stay at Dar Hafsa in Fes and were treated like family right away. We were picked up by Soufyane at Bab Boujeloud (blue gate) right when we were dropped off by our driver. He carried our luggage and navigated quickly through the buzzing little streets of Fes. The Dar is a small (4 guestrooms) guesthouse located in the middle of the old Medina right next the main street. Its the perfect starting point for exploring this medieval town. It also has a terrace overlooking the town which can be used at will while enjoying some traditional mint tea. Abdul Kharim (the owner of the guesthouse) took perfect care of us and recommended a nice little place for us to have dinner (60 DHS pp.), right next to the blue gate - you should go there as well.

 August 2016,5,Our New Home away from Home,"This was our first time to Morocco, and what an adventure it has been. I can honestly say that one of our most memorable experiences was staying at Dar Hafsa in Fes. The owner Abdul, his daughter Miriam, and Soufyane became like family in the few days we were there. They made sure we had the best guides for our adventures in their magnificent city including Nouradine, our city guide. Soufyane and Abdul also made the best mint tea in Morocco that we would drink durning conversations on the rooftop terrace overlooking the medina. If you are planning a visit to Morocco, Fes and Dar Hafsa should be at the top of your list. I look forward to returning and spending more time in the beautiful surroundings of Dar Hafsa and Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2016,5,Wonderful Welcome to Fez,"Wow, what an amazing place to stay at while visiting Fes. I don't believe I have ever experienced a more welcoming group of people than at the beautiful Dar Hafsa. Miriam was so helpful with our arrangements and emailing us so promptly even with suggestions about safe travel. They are so accommodating, the owner Abdul set us up with guides, car tours, even helped with our bus tickets for the continuation of our trip. Our guide thru Fes was remarkable!!! I would highly recommend using a him, Noureddine was his name and his English as well as historical knowledge was amazing. Soufyane was so helpful and considerate and makes a delicious mint tea!! Best place to stay in Fez with the most welcoming and kind people.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2016,5,Gorgeous Dar with Attentive Service,"My sister and I had a wunderful stay at Dar Hafsa. The Dar is located in the centre of the Medina in a quiet side alley. The beautiful interior is decorated with the typical andalusian style of Fès with painted wood, carved clay and mosaics and has a rooftop terrace with a great view.

The owner organised an English speaking guide for us and he was brilliant took us round all the historical sites and then to the craftsmen, with no pressure to buy! We made a purchase of a leather footstool from the Chouara tannery, but of our own decision! We were also recommended a brilliant place to eat and including tip cost us £8.00 each for 3 courses and drinks! We definitely recommend Dar Hafsa for your stay in Fes 😀",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2016,5,Great Riad (but don't do the tour),"We spent a couple of nights in this Riad, and everything was excellent. The beds were very comfortable, rooms were clean, and you were given more than enough food for breakfast (standard Moroccan pastries/breads, jam/butter, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, and juice/coffee/tea). The staff was really helpful in terms of finding good places to eat and finding our way around the medina. The only thing that would not be recommended is taking a tour through the Medina - when we first arrived at the Riad, the first thing that was mentioned was that we should do it to really see all of Fez, but you end up being taken to about 5 or 6 different shops and are pressured into buying things, which we found really uncomfortable. All in all a great stay in Fez, just don't waste your money on an…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2016,5,Fantastic family hotel,From the moment we booked we felt confident that our stay would be a success. Meriam contacted us to meet us at the bab boujloud gate.

We enjoyed a late night chat and more tea with Sofiane and some other guests up there. Very memorable. Breakfast was a delicious feast!

The staff at the Riad were so kind and detail oriented. Especially.. Soufyine who made our stay especially special. He was very friendly...and took care of every detail. He made us the best cup of tea I've ever had in Fez...and was so friendly. The Riad is gorgeous and in the heart of the Medina. My daughters and I felt very safe and taken care of. It's also very close to the train station. Very hospitable and felt like I was amongst family. Would definitely recommend this to everyone:),Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

He also organised a tour of the medina and a day trip to Chefchaouen for us. Sofiayne and Miriam were also very helpful and made us lots of delicious mint tea. The riad is beautifully decorated, the terrace has great views, and the air con works a treat. Easy walking distance to all parts of the medina. The brekky is delicious and plentiful, and on the days we left early in the morning they gave us a take away breakfast. You won't be disappointed if you stay here!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 July 2016,5,Best little Ryal in Fez,"If you enjoy friendly service and feeling like part of the family, you'll love this place.

 May 2016,5,Great staff and quiet location,"We had a wonderful experience during our one-night stay at Dar Hafsa. If we had more time, we would have loved to stay longer! We were in touch with Abdul who was very prompt with e-mail replies and easily reached by phone prior to our arrival. We were given instructions to take a cab to Bab Boujloud where Soufyane promptly met us and walked us to the riad. We didn't get the chance to meet the owner but Soufyane took great care of us, offering us mint tea and chatting with us on the terrace. Soufyane was by far the friendliest host we had during our travels through Morocco! Him along with Miriam, helped us set up a guided tour the next day to maximize our time in Fez. After showing us the way once, we were able to navigate around the medina and back to the riad quite easily.…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2016,5,Top notch hospitality,"We had an excellent time at Dar Hafsa!

There was a driver and car waiting for us when we arrived with a sign. They drove us to the Medina, which was pretty far and totally worth the 15 euros extra. The owner, Abdul met us at the gate and was super nice and walked us to the hotel. It was a pretty long walk, through a slightly overwhelming crowd but we were happy to arrive at the beautiful hotel. All the rooms were awesome, and because there was an empty room that was slightly nicer than the one we booked we got to stay there with no additional cost. Abdul was phenomenal and actually took us to dinner with him shortly after we arrived and lent us dirham because we only had euros. The stay was…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,"Incredible value for lovely, centrally located, very helpful riad","We chose this riad because of it's excellent reviews, and we weren't disappointed. It has wonderful traditional decorations, a lovely roof terrace, and is centrally located in the medina, but just off the main thoroughfare so that it is quiet. It is incredible value for the price. But the best thing of all is the staff. My husband was sick when we arrived (and we ended up cutting our trip short and returning home), and Abdul Kareem and his daughter Maryam were most helpful, including Maryam going with us to the doctor and translating for us. We didn't get to see much of the town, but hopefully we'll return one day, and this is definitely where we will stay.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,Amazing hospitality and location in Fes medina,"What a delightful experience we had staying in Fes at Dar Hafsa. Abdul Karim is a warm host, with a terrific property in an ideal location inside the medina close to the ""blue gate"". We have stayed at other dars (lg homes) and riads in Fes and other parts of Morocco. Dar Hafsa receives our unreserved highest rating for the quality of its lodging conditions and Abdul Karim's genuine interest in the quality of our experience in Fes. He set us up with three touring expeditions in our 4-day stay -- each one satisfying to our family. Friends and family have been monitoring (some nervously) our trip through our daily social media posts. Those considering following in our steps to Fes will surely book with (now our) friend, Abdul Karim at Dar Hafsa. Oh, did I mention that this Trip…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,Lovely oasis in the bustling old medina,"Great location, quiet at night, lovely roof top terrace for when you want to unwind from the insanity of the medina. As a single traveller I really appreciated the personal touch the owner and his family and staff showed me. They were always there with mint tea, engaging conversation and directions, they found me a driver to see the sites outside Fez and a guide willing to take me to the tile factory. When I expressed interest in experiencing a local hammam, the owners daughter went with me! I recommend this riad and the lovely people warmly.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,4,Super value for money,"A wonderful cosy Riad off the main street in the Medina where the bustle is. The location is perfect as it is close to the most interesting monuments and to the very hub of things. The owner, Abdul Karim himself came out to the gate Bab Boujlad to meet us ( where the taxi could stop ) and guide us through the Medina maze directly to the Riad. The owner, his daughter Meryam and assistant, Soufyane treated us like family and guided us to where we could get delicious meals for reasonable prices. He also helped us with providing an English speaking guide who took us to the interesting spots, shops and monuments in the Medina. Good breakfast too. One could ask our Abdul Karim anything and he would always help. A generous gift of cinnamon powder for instance which we will take home !",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,Easy access location,"The place is a very traditional raid. Owner and his staff speak good English & we have no problems in communication. Anything we do not know, they can provide us the answers. They even take us to do money exchange. The breakfast is very good and has plenty to eat.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,Beautiful riad & excellent service,The owner is super friendly and personable. He met us at Bab Boujloud and walked us back to the riad which was beautifully decorated. He offered good recommendations on local guide who was very knowledgable and on restaurants. The riad is on a quiet location and convenient to old town.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,First Trip to Morocco,I would like to say that the Bed and Breakfast staff and owner were very personal and extremely helpful in assisting with directions and providing five star service!!

 May 2016,5,Great place to stay!,"My friend and I traveled to Fes in May 2016, and stayed at Dar Hafsa. We really enjoyed our stay. The owner was fantastic and really made us feel at home. He was extremely helpful, gave us tips and information, and was very generous. Next time we are in Fes, we are definitely staying in Dar Hafsa.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,Best Oasis of Hospitality in Fez,"What a wonderful place and an authentic Fez experience! We were welcomed by a local family from day one, and their hospitality made our Fez visit truly memorable. Everything was perfect- from advising best places to visit, arranging a good Fez guide, arranging our day trip to Meknes and Volubilis, and even helping with going shopping with Moroccan haggling along the way- every part was a highlight! And how can we forget the breakfasts with great choice of home made breads, and of course Moroccan mint tea, which was available any time for us! Great location too- only a few minutes from the Blue Gate and souks, but quiet at the same time so guests can relax after a busy day in the medina. Very child friendly place and ideal for families with small kids. Highly recommended for the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2016,5,"Beautiful Riad , great service!","From the moment we booked they were very helpful with information and details on getting there! Abdul greeted us at the entrance of the Medina with a big smile. He gave us all the tips and recommendations to make our stay great, and was always making sure we didn't pay more then we should around the souk! The breakfast was delicious, with tons of breads and pastries. Beautiful Riad , cozy and small enough to have just the right amount of guests.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2016,5,The best of Fes!,"As soon as I had made my reservation, I received a welcome from the riad staff. They encouraged me to call when I arrived,,so someone could meet me at the gate to the medina. They discouraged me from accepting 'deals' from strangers on the way. Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly by Abdul and his daughter. The air conditioning works. There is hot water for the shower and breakfast is incredible! Abdul arranged a tour for me, gave recommendations on restaurants, and showed me how to get to the Royal Palace and the gardens. He was especially nice in his concern for an older woman traveling alone. It is close to the Main Street and any kind of Moroccan shop you could want. Their night clerk is also extremely solicitous and helpful.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,Excellent Stay,"We stayed at Dar Hafsa in March this year. We were there for 2 nights. - Rooms are beautiful, clean and comfortable - The breakfast is AWESOME!!!! We so looked forward to it every morning. The presentation and the overall ambiance of the common area where you have the breakfast is very beautiful. - The Riad has a roof terrace, although a little small but the views of Fez are really good. - It's a small family run business. People are kind and helpful. Good hospitality. - This is a good value for money Riad.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2016,5,Great place to stay,"Ideally located in the heart of the Medina of old Fez, this small friendly family run guest house proved perfect for me as a single traveller. I was treated very much as a guest, and the cups of mint tea served up by Soufyane at the end of long day were very welcome as were the chats over the tea. The owner, his daughter and staff Soufyane were all very helpful with useful suggestions as to what to see and do. The house itself is a minute’s walk off one of the main streets, yet is a haven of peace from the bustle and noise close by. It is beautiful inside (traditionally decorated) with a small roof terrace with great views. Breakfasts were a treat and set you up for the day. Helpfully, I was met at an entrance to the Medina on arrival and guided to the guest house. Similarly,…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,Stay Here!,"Dar Hafsa was a great place to stay in the Medina, easily accessible, with a really warm staff, lovely space, and wonderful breakfast. The beds were comfortable, you get to stay in a historic part of Fes, and the furnishings are really colorful. Breakfast comes with more kinds of bread than you thought possible, along with eggs, olives, jams, coffee or tea, juice, and another dish. There's a nice rooftop deck for looking out over the city. You can spend days wandering nearby, or can take a taxi from the front gate, which is nearby, to sites beyond the Medina. The staff is very helpful in making arrangements and giving suggestions. Fes itself is a wonderful city, don't miss it on your trip to Morocco!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2016,5,Absolutely loved our stay here!,"The owner and staff here are so gracious and welcoming. They gave us great advice on sights to see, places to eat, and even arranged a tour guide for us. The house itself has a very traditional feel with a beautiful sitting area where breakfast is served as well as a rooftop deck with great views over the Medina rooftops to the surrounding mountains. Breakfast was delicious and abundant and we loved the complimentary mint tea that was generously brewed whenever we wanted it. We even had the pleasure of being included in a family meal of couscous with the owner and his daughter. The wifi worked great, the shower water was hot, the room comfortable and clean and the location convenient to all the major sights. A definite winner!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2016,3,Quick Stay in Dar Hafsa,"The room was spacious and comfortable, the people were polite and helpful. Because of our schedule we arrived around 8pm and left early the next morning. Make sure you call ahead of your arrival so the staff can meet you at the entrance to the medina, otherwise you will have a hard time locating the place and may run into some pushy sketchy characters offering to ""help"" you.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,Magnificent stay in Fes @ Dar Hafsa,"Great Riad family owned and operated. The owner was very helpful and informative, was a tremendous help in arranging recommendations of restaurants and guides personally escorted us from Blue Gate into the medina to his Riad on first night, also upon leaving he escorted us to the Blue Gate and hailed us a taxi. Ran into him later that week upon our return from the Sahara, we were trying to locate another Riad (unfortunately, Dar Hafsa was fully booked) he gladly directed us to the competitive Riad. In my opinion, that's service. I highly recommend Dar Hafsa and will definitely return again.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,"Highly Recommend! Great Location, Wonderful Management...","As other reviews have mentioned, the location is wonderful --right off of a main street (so it's easy to find, when you're exploring the souks on your own) and yet very quiet-- and the management are really invested in making sure you have a great stay. The breakfast was filling and the rooms were clean. I hope to see Mr. Karim and Miriem soon. My stay was not long enough!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,Mesmerizing,"Quintessential Moroccan hotel. This family run hotel is fantastic. While within the maze of the medina, once there it is quiet, and very comfortable. The owner is very accommodating and made our stay so very enjoyable. WiFi worked very well in the room and we were on the top floor. Breakfast was traditional and satisfying. Within minutes of the ""main"" medina thorough-fare and about a ten minute walk form the blue gate. If you book, follow the instructions you will receive and you will have no problem getting to this place, and once there I am sure you will enjoy it as much as we did. Certainly would give this my highest recommendation - I would stay here again if ever back in Fes!!!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,Great place to stay in Fes.,"Had a very lovely stay in Dar Hafsa. The interior is beautiful and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Nice roof terrace to sip some mint tea.

 March 2016,5,A hidden gem in Fes´s Medina,We stayed in Dar Hafsa for two nights and we couldn´t have been any happier. Mr Abdul-Kareem and his daughter were exceptionally hospitable and made us feel like family. Kareem helped us plan our time in Fes and arranged for an official guide. The Riad itself is beautiful and the rooms are cozy. Highly recommended!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,Mrs Rafudeen,Amazing hospitality. The owner and his daughter including the young gentleman that helps at night went completely out of there way to assist us with exactly what we needed. Will recommend dar Hafsa to anyone that would travel to Fez,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,Good place to stay,"The hostel is a good place to stay since it has a good staff and host which treat us like a family. The staff is called Soufyane and he is handsome. Girls must come to meet him!!! Breakfast contains a variety of foods and we think it would be good to most of the travelers. Moreover, decoration of room is nice and it is a comfortable place to sleep. The photo is take by the host of the hostel.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,My favorite Riad in Fes,"I just have one word to describe my stay at riad Dar Hafsa, amazing. My experience since making my reservation was incredible. They provided detailed information in how to get to the riad as well as provided helpful tips into where to park my car. Once at the riad we were received with a hot cup of mint tea and provided a map with sites of interest. Breakfast in the morning was a great spread of local baked goodies as well as fresh fruits accompanied with coffee and freshly brewed mint tea. After breakfast our host kindly offered to go up to the terrace and show us the Medina. As we did small talk about what activities we had planned for the day he offered to personally take us to visit several local artisans so we could buy souvenirs at a fair price. This is invaluable since as…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2016,5,"Helpful owner, homely feel","The owner was FAB! We arrived late on in the evening and he recommended a few options for dinner places and called the tourism office to arrange a guide to take us around the city as we only had half a day in Fes. If we hadnt stayed at Dar Hafsa we would never have seen and done so much, so we are very grateful. There was a really homely feel and it is what I would imagine staying with a Moroccan family would be like. The breakfast was an absolute feast. No question went unanswered and we were given assistance with everything including where to get our boarding passes printed and where to get taxis from. The owner came to meet us on arrival in Fes",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,4,"Great location, friendly staff, comfortable room","We stayed here in March 2016, and cannot speak highly enough of Dar Hafsa. The owner was very friendly and helpful, making sure we were able to see the city, helping arrange transport and providing some tips for seeing Fes. Our room was very comfortable and the inside of this riad is really nice to look at with its intricate decorations. Would definitely recommend anyone visiting Fes stay here.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2016,5,"Great place, location and people!","Just when you thought Moroccan hospitality couldn't get any better, we checked in to Dar Hafsa in Fes. The riad is stunning and very beautifully decorated. It's run by a lovely set of people that were extremely helpful and cheerful to be with. They offered us great advice and were able to answer our many questions. We loved the location - it's very quaint and quite easy to find in the medina! The view from the terrace is simply beautiful, overlooking most of the old city. Lovely place, lovely people! We would highly recommend this to anyone looking to stay in Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2016,4,Good riad,"Dar Hafsa is a lovely Riad at a quiet enclosure close to the main streets in the Fes Medina, Mr Abdul-Kareem and his daughter Maryam are warm, welcoming hosts who treat their guests very well. During our stay we were the only guests and benefited from attention from them. Maryam kindly accompanied me to buy clothes for my 10 year-old daughter whose suitcase we had forgotten! They also do tours though we cannot give any feedback on this as we had had ours booked with a different agency (which turned out to be very good). I do need to caution though to those who take recommendations from Mr Abdul-Kareem for shopping e.g. carpets, ceramics etc that they DO NOT give any ‘reasonable’ prices based on being an acquaintance/guest of Dar Hafsa; so do bargain as if it is any other…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2016,5,Beautiful riad in heart of Fez Medina,Dar Hafsa is a stunning place to stay in the middle of the Fez Medina. The staff is absolutely wonderful and welcoming- they accommodated us last minute after we arrived from Marrakesh at 3 in the morning. The breakfast was great and had an array of choices. It is a wonderful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2016,5,Great place to stay in Fes!,"We enjoyed our stay very much and felt like home from the first minute on. Thats why we even stayed two nights longer than planned. Especially at the breakfast table we felt like royals. It was the best breakfast we had! I recommend it to everyone who wants to stay at a familiar, peaceful and lovely place in Fes!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2016,5,Wonderful riad and welcoming host,"Kareem and Mariam were wonderful hosts. They were extremely accommodating and helpful in going above and beyond to make our trip enjoyable. i would highly recommend to have the airport pickup as the madina can be confusing for newcomers to orientate. The rooms were spotless and the bathrooms are large, facilitated with hot powerful showers. The rooftop terrace is beautiful where you can enjoy your breakfast while overlooking the city. I am so glad kareem helped us organise the desert tour, as we have had few companies replying back with extortionate prices and sending constant pestering emails with gradual price decreases. I really liked that when dealing with kareem, he was fair and helpful, everything was swift and direct. We went on a two days desert tour which consisted…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2016,5,Home away from home in Fes Medina,"My wife and I were in Fes for 2 nights towards the end of our two-week journey in beautiful Morocco. We stayed in many Riads in Essaouira, Marrakesh, Dades, Merzouga, etc. and I can say, without a doubt, that we felt the most at home at Dar Hafsa. The Dar is family run, and the welcome and support we received during our stay truly exemplified Moroccan hospitality for us. We truly felt that we had a family of our own in Morocco that cared for us, even going to the extent of accompanying us to see a doctor when I arrived in Fes with a bad case of upset stomach after our desert trip, or going out of their way to book appointments, guides, exchange money or find a place to eat. It's what we truly wanted in Morocco after a hectic trip: simplicity, kindness, honesty and care. We saw…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2016,5,Fantastic stay!,"We had a fantastic stay at Dar Hafsa! The first stop on our trip in Morocco, our stay in Fes was made truly incredible by the staff at Dar Hafsa. The staff made us feel so at home, sweet Moroccan tea was plentiful, and breakfast was abundant and delicious! The owner of Dar Hafsa, Karim, and his family went above and beyond picking us up at the main gate, arranging tours and dinner reservations, and even helping us get the best price for souvenirs and hammam experiences. We would highly recommend Dar Hafsa to anyone coming to Fes!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2016,5,Amazing stay!!,Dar Hafsa was our first stop on our trip in Morocco. The staff was so friendly and made us feel right at home. The owner Karim came to pick us up from the train when we arrived and greeted us with Moroccan tea. Each morning we got a delicious breakfast with lots of treats to try. Karim also helped us with booking tours and his daughter brought us to the Hammam to make sure we got the best price. Overall we had an amazing stay in Fes and couldn't have stayed at a better hotel!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2015,5,Best hosts in Morocco,"Walking into Dar Hafsa was a breath of fresh air.

 December 2015,5,Very friendly owner,"The place is very nice but the owner really makes the difference. He was very helpful and friendly.

I definitely recommend this place.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Enjoy this wonderful place!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2015,5,"Great, intimate place to stay in the old Medina, with a fantastic owner.","My father and I stayed at Dar Hafsa over Christmas and had a wonderful time. It's a beautiful Dar, wonderfully decorated and quite intimate. The shower has consistently hot water and the WiFi works fine. But I believe the true gem of this place is the owner Abdul Kareem who has been one of the most helpful people on our visit in Morocco. He speaks excellent English and was very helpful in acquainting us to Morocco and helping us get train tickets, suggesting places to eat and places to see in Fes. The Dar is fairly central though hard to find, thankfully, Abdul Kareem was very helpful organizing a ride from the airport late at night and taking us to his Dar once we arrived at the steps of the Medina and showing is the way highly recommended.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2015,5,Amazing trip in Fes,"Staying at Dar Hafsa was amazing, and our trip would not have been as good as it was if not for staying there. The rooms are very nicer, we were recommended great places to eat and was very hospitable, and right in the center of the Medina! I would recommend asking the owner about the Desert camel excursions, ours was great! We were driven out to the Sahara and rode out over on camels where we were able to stay at a Berber camp where we slept for the night and explored the beautiful desert! For sure you should email Dar Hafsa about this as it was all set up by them!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2015,5,very nice weekend,"We really enjoyed our one night stay at Dar Hafsa, the staff is very sweet and the room was comfortable and clean. As we had only about 24 hours in Fes, we were grateful for the owner's help in finding nice restaurants and organizing an official tour guide for a half-day excursion in the medina. The owner picked us up when we arrived and the hotel was easy to find after that initial trip. When one of us was feeling under the weather, a staff member was wonderfully helpful and accompanied the other into the souk to find vegetable soup, bread, and dates to keep spirits high (and brought the lot to the room on a silver platter!). Breakfast was lovely and very copious, all sorts of Moroccan crepes, and different breads served with fresh butter, honey, jam, cheese, etc. Highly…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2015,5,Authentic and attentive,"I agree with all the other 5 star reviews. The owner, manager and staff go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. You are met at the blue gate and brought to the Dar, which is a must when staying in the Medina. From then on it is 24 hour service. Really, Mohammed, who is very friendly and funny, stays at the Dar with you. Owner and manager greet you for breakfast (wonderful and plentiful) to ensure you are having a good stay and help with any question about Morocco. Place is better than pictures and terrace is great.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

They gave us suggestions on places to eat and how to get to the next destination. The riad is very clean, the beds very comfortable, the showers very warm.

The location is also in the Medina and very close to all the main sites. Staying here is a no brainer!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2015,5,Gem in Fes,"Our first time in Morocco and our first time in Fes, and we stayed at the amazing Dar Hafsa in the heart of the Fes medina, and we could not be happier with our stay!

 November 2015,5,amazing stay in Fes + desert tour,"We had an absolutely amazing stay at Dar Hafsa! I couldn’t speak more highly of it for anyone traveling to Fes – a great host makes all the difference in Morocco. Abdul organised a two-night desert tour for us at a far better price than what we had been quoted by any tour company and it was perfect, we had a spacious private car, rode camels at sunrise and sunset, and saw incredible sights on the long drive through the country. He was so on the ball with us throughout our trip – he booked us a day tour with a fantastic guide named Noureddine, which was definitely the best way to see Fes (in its confusing enormity)! He also recommended a restaurant where we ended up having the best meal of our two weeks in Morocco.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2015,5,Don't miss this gem when visiting Fes,"I can't imagine a better value for the money than this impeccably restored, well located, former family home which is the perfect base for visiting Fes medina, which is like going back in time. Although with outstanding restored bathrooms, hot showers with European fixtures and comfortable, well appointed rooms Dar Hafsa offers many advantages of a modern home. From responsive pre arrival communication to thoughtfully escorting us from the medina gate to the inn, the charming polyglot owner of Dar Hafsa took care of us as though we were his daughters. Abdul, as well as his attentive employee, Mohamed, went out of their way to ensure that we had a comfortable, safe and enjoyable stay.

 October 2015,5,Ending on a high note!!,"I cannot fault this hotel. Excellent value for money!  The owner Abdul and staff (esp Mohamed) have gone out of their way to make us feel at home. From the 'meet and greet' at our car on arrival and cup of mint tea when we checked in to organizing someone to show us the way to and from a wonderful restaurant on our first night (the Fes medina is very confusing when you arrive, so this was very welcome) The interior is decorated in a similar style to some of the historical buildings we had seen; mosaics, painted doors and plaster engravings. Charming. Other positives: clean bedrooms and shower room; gorgeous HOT showers; comfortable beds, generous breakfast, we felt safe walking in the area and had no problems with noise during our stay. I will definitely stay here again if I…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

It's worth your time to sit down and have a cup of mint tea and chat about whatever comes up.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2015,5,Amazing hospitality and kindness,"This is the best hostel we have ever stayed in. The owner and his staff are extremely welcoming, helpful and selfless. Not to mention the huge delicious breakfast they serve. The day we arrived he helped us find a guide and even walked with us to our parking to ensure our car was parked in a safe place. You cannot go wrong staying here and the price vs quality is out of this world. Mohammed his main employee is very kind and also a great singer. :)",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2015,5,Best place to stay in Fes,"From start to finish our stay was superb. Dar Hafsa arranged to pick us up from the airport, and we were taken to Fes and met by the owner, Abdul, who had come out specially to greet us - even though it was late - and provided us with some very much needed mint tea. Everybody was friendly and helpful, and anything we needed was no trouble, barely even needing to ask before it is done. Tours of the medina and the mid Atlas mountains (a welcome break from shopping!) were arranged for us. Mint tea on the terrace was relaxing in the evening. The only complaint is that there is a noisy cockerel somewhere in Fes, which starts about 3am and doesn't give up until it gets dark again!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2015,5,Staying in Fes? Look no further ...,"The second I booked my stay through TripAdvisor I knew I was in good hands. I received a courteous email immediately after booking from the owner, Abdul Karim, offering to arrange a ride from the airport to meet me at the gates of the medina of Fes el Bali and escort me to Dar Hafsa. Upon arrival he and his daughter received me with warm hospitality giving me mint tea (a Moroccan tradition) in their beautiful family Dar. Then and there Abdul Karim provided sound advice on what to do during my stay. He explained where I could find the best panoramic vista of the medina and recommended the best meal I had in Morocco.

 September 2015,5,Go here if you want a warm welcome to Fes,"Owner is very hospitable, speaks good English and even helped me find another place to stay since I could only stay for one night instead of three. Great breakfast, beautiful room He'll pick you up from Bab Boujloud - main entrance to medina. I paid 430 dirham. Totally worth it. He arranged tour with driver to Meknes, Volubilis and Moudray Idriss (800 dirham) for me. He recommended great place to eat just outside Bab Boujloud with rooftop terrace",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2015,5,Incredibly friendly and accommodating,"My girlfriend and I booked this place without reading the reviews but are so glad we did. It was by far and away our favourite stop in Morocco. Karim and his staff were friendly and helpful, without being intrusive or pushy. When we arrived at the medina, we rang Karim and he picked us up in minutes. The location is ideal and once you've got your bearings it's simple to find. My girlfriend and I always felt safe. The breakfast is huge. We were there for several days and Karim made sure it was not always the same. We booked a tour of the medina through Karim. It was reasonably priced and lasted the whole day. Our guide was Nourdinne, whose knowledge was second to none and we learnt so much. We saw a lot of great sights during the morning. In the afternoon, we were taken…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2015,5,Back again,"We said after our last visit that we would be back again but we didn't think it would be so soon. Everything was just as it was on our last visit. Friendly greeting, helpful family and comfortable room. Breakfasts being excellent on the last visit we didn't think they could be improved on. Wrong. The starter for want of a better word was a delicious fresh fruit and yoghourt cocktail and that is praise because I rarely eat fruit. The day trip that was organised for us was well planned and every bit as interesting as the last and well worthwhile",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2014,5,An inviting and wonderful home,"We had a wonderful time staying in a beautiful, spacious room in this gen of a home, welcomed by the kind and hospitable family. We particularly enjoyed the plentiful, delicious breakfast, consisting of hand-made breakfast pastries obtained from local bakers. It's not an exaggeration to say this was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2015,4,"A solid bet, though was expecting a little more","My wife and I stayed here for one night, and although it has the facilities and friendly staff, we were expecting something slightly nicer based on the reviews (we booked through tripadvisor). The rooms are clean but not as big as we'd imagined. The en suite bathroom we had was a little disappointing but clean nontheless. Thankfully the upstairs room was available as the downstairs room didn't appear to have as much privacy. We didn't have the breakfast as we were fasting for ramadan, but the staff were kind enough to let us use the fridge to put some of our drinks and fruit in for our pre-sunrise meal. The room had air conditioning which was useful because it got quite humid. The collection of guidebooks in the lobby was impressive and wifi was quite fast. Overall, this is a…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2015,4,A family house,"The Dar Hafsa was a little hard to find, with all the hustlers trying to deviate us from our path, but fortunately a friend help us overcoming another hustle, and lead us to the Riad. We were very well received, and, even at late hours, got a lot of tips on how to deal with the city, and we were offered a very good mint tea, and a nice moment in the terrace. Our room was changed to a better room, just because was available. A nice touch from the staff. The rooms are very good, and overall, the Riad is a very nice place to be at. The next day started with an amazing breakfast, clearly a big plus. Then we were recommended to the ""best restaurant in Morocco"". It might well be, but that has clearly a cost. We were going back to Marrakech by the second night, but Abdul gave…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2015,4,Comfortable but nothing special,"This is a quaint hotel that is fine for an overnight stay. The room was reasonably clean, but it was stuffy, and the toilet was basic. I would say it's 3.5 stars, but I can't give half stars on Tripadvisor. If you need to quickly book a place, this hotel does the job, but don't expect anything outstanding.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2015,4,"Welcoming host, good location","An excellent place to stay- felt very welcomed, and everything we asked for- from dinner recommendations to a tour guide - were taken care of without hesitation.

 July 2015,5,Brilliant hospitality,"I've had a brilliant stay in Dar Hafsa this week, the service has been impeccable, the staff and owner helpful and friendly. Abdul-karim and his daughter arranged a taxi from the airport and he met me at the gate of the medina. As a single female traveller I was assured of my safety and made to feel confident wandering around alone by his friendly advice and tips for how to keep myself oriented in the maze of streets. The breakfast was plentiful (more than enough in fact). The house and the rooms are beautifully presented with local fabrics and traditional decoration/ fixtures, as well as being perfectly clean and comfortable. I took a guided tour of the medina with an official guide, hired through the Dar. The guide was really excellent, easy to talk to and ask questions of,…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Everybody speaks English in the hotel which was a nice bonus. The owner helped is with an official guide from the city to show the Medina. He also advised us for good restaurants with great views and good food. A tour was also arranged for us from Fes to Marrakech going through Merzouga, Todra Gorges and Aït Benhaddou in a very comfortable car with a nice driver who was also very accomodating.

 July 2015,5,The Best place to stay in Fes,"First of all i would like to apologize Karim for a small delay with writing this review: I promised to do it within two days after our check-out but since we traveled further into the country i had small problems with that :) But going back to the point: frankly speaking i can't imagine better place to stay in Fez then Dar Hafsa. Its located almost in the center of old Medina in narrow quiet street, the stuff was very nice and helpful the place is very clean, quiet and really, really beautifull from inside. It has free internet, decent breakfast, conditioning and nice bathrooms - basically there is nothing i could have problem with. Karim - who owns the place - can give you advices where to go or what to see or if you are interested he can organize for you a professional turist…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2015,5,Great location with helpful host,"We stayed two nights at Dar Hafsa. It's perfectly located and easy to find within the labyrinth that is the medina. The house is beautiful and the service is excellent. Abdul the owner accommodated our every need. He even took me to the pharmacy when my sister didn't feel well. If you're looking for a small and quiet place with a good location, this is it. And the breakfast is tasty too.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2014,5,Excellent hosts,"This is a family owned Riad and the family was extremely hospitable. The owner was extremely helpful. He helped get us a tour of the city and helped us get a driver out to Volubilis and Meknes. While we didn't really feel like the tour of the Medina was really worth it the driver to Volubilis and Meknes was perfect. The driver drove us out there, stopped when we wanted to take pictures, helped us order lunch at a restaurant that didn't speak english, and was a very safe driver. He even made suggestions on where we should go and what we should see. The owner even let us borrow books on Volubilis when we went out there. The breakfast was plentiful and the son showed me how to make mint tea the Moroccan way. My wife and I were very pleased with our stay and would stay…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2015,4,"A good place to stay, but don't take a guide","My husband and I stayed in Dar Hafsa for two nights in May this year. This Dar is well located and it is quite easy to find it considering the number of streets in the Medina. It has been beautifully decorated in authentic Morrocan style by the owner’s daughter Meriem. The roof terrace is also a pleasant place to enjoy your coffee or tea. Our room was fine, though I did not sleep well (not sure if that was because of lack of fresh air or an uncomfortable bed or something else). The bathroom has an unusual set up, but it was fine with us. It could do with a couple of small improvements, like more cloth hooks and toilet paper hanger. We were served very good breakfast. On the day we were leaving early in the morning it was prepared beforehand and packed for us, which was nice. The…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

From start to finish, Karim and his family made us feel right at home and went out of their way to make our stay memorable. Karim arranged for a driver to meet us at the airport and then met us at the gate when we arrived at the medina and personally escorted us to the house. Our room was quite comfortable, and we were very thankful for the air conditioning during this hot time of year. The breakfast Mariam served us was wonderful! We really appreciated Karim's recommendations for what to see and do on our whirlwind stop here. We were so glad he set us up with a tour guide for the day. We saw and learned so much more than we ever would have on our own. Thanks again, Karim and family, for an…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2015,5,Stay here!,"Amazing place to stay in Fes. Especially if you're young and traveling alone or with friends. We got there our first night and sat down in their super authentic living room for tea. We had no idea what we were doing and the owner helped us plan our entire trip. He set us up with a private driver the next day to go see some more rural areas (which was great and cheap) and made us a dinner reservation for that night. A man from the restaurant came to the hotel and brought us there himself. The owner also helped us find ATMs/places to buy bottled water and was very accessible. Breakfast was great, filling, and felt very authentic. Super fun, intimate environment that's perfect for your first time in Morocco. Can't recommend this place enough.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 June 2015,5,Wonderful hospitality,"We were greeted by the owner, Abdul Karim, who was most attentive and hospitable to us throughout our stay. The rooms were cosy and clean. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was wonderful. The air conditioning was a godsend, given the warm Moroccan evenings! Only a stones throw away from the main ""high street"", Dar Hafsa is ideally located. Abdul Karim helped us with organisation of transport from the train station and to the airport, helped recommend and organise a lovely Hammam experience and ensured one of the best restaurants in Fes stayed open beyond its usual closing time just so that we could eat when we returned from a day trip late in the day. The breakfast was a Moroccan feast - an abundant array of the finest foods, including many different varieties of bread.…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2015,5,Dar Hafsa is the best!!!,My stay at Dar Hafsa was amazing!!! I had such a great time in Fes and much of it wouldn't have been possible without the excellent planning and help from the staff! As an American woman traveling alone it was great to have such a reliable resource! The breakfasts are to die for with traditional Moroccan food and a neverending source of mint tea! Located right off the main street so very easy to find on your own!! Beautiful tile and traditional decorations in every room! Great amenities including internet and western style toilets. Would definitely stay again!!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2015,5,"Fantastic trip to Fes, loved every minute!","Dar Hafsa, located on a tranquil side street of the medina, is beautiful and inexpensive. Full, delicious breakfast & free mint tea anytime you want on the roof terrace. The staff could not have been friendlier--they picked us up on our first night, showed us around the first day and even came with us to a carpet shop that turned out to be a scam (thanks to their help we got a full refund). You MUST stay here while visiting Fes, especially if it is your first time. Large, clean rooms in a perfect location--couldnt ask for a better experience.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2015,5,"Great stay, great host","Dar Hafsa is the best place to stay for a first time visit to Morocco! The owner is incredibly kind, knowledgable, and will always steer you in the right direction (which can be difficult to do in a city of 9,000 streets)! The day begins with an incredible breakfast-- oranges with cinnamon, cherries, honey and dips, multiple breads, eggs, fresh-squeezed orange juice and tea and coffee!! A great way to start the day!! The rooms and building are beautiful, and the rooftop terrace is an especially wonderful treat after a long day!!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2015,5,Fantastic riad with very friendly hosts,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights and have no hesitation in recommending this place to others. Great location not far from the blue gate, breakfast was really good each morning, the breakfast was really fresh. But what makes this place more worthwhile is the attention to detail of the staff especially the owner to all their guests, ensuring everyone gets the most out of their stay not only in Fes but of Morocco, I felt the staff treated their guests as more family than guests and there is always a staff member nearby. Only issue we was that the shower train was near the toilet but that didn't impact on our stay at all. If you want a nice, affordable stay that is close to everything than look no further.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2015,5,"Good location, helpful staff","Had a lovely three-night stay here. Staff were so helpful booking a guide for us and advising on a place for dinner (Dar Tagine). Centrally located, not far from the Blue Gate, but the boys came to meet us and guide us to the hotel (otherwise we might not have found it). Quiet location and a bit rustic, but the beds are comfortable, it's in a quiet location and the friendly, helpful staff really make for a great stay.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2015,5,Best place to stay in fez!,"I have stayed in Dar Hafsa for seven wonderful nights. My time here has been fantastic and I couldn't be more pleased with the accommodations. I am a woman traveling solo, and I highly recommend this place as the perfect ""home base"" from which to explore the magical medina, and also to take day trips to Meknes, Volubilis or Chefchaouen. If you are a single woman traveling (or a couple) this is the place for you! The location is ideal and safe, especially at this time of the year (May) when the sacred music festival is on. Dar Hafsa is within walking distance to everything and easy to find once you orient yourself to the layout of the medina. The house is wonderfully decorated and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. I stayed in the top room with private bathroom and it…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2015,2,Not as good as some of the reviews,"We chose this riad solely based on the reviews it got on tripadvisor. Our stay here was a disappointment. The owner pushed us to get a tour guide or try food at this one restaurant he kept recommending. We told him many times that we wanted to tour on our own and had no intention of getting a tour guide or be taken to any restaurant. For breakfast we received some bread and spreads with ONE boiled egg for two people. Our room had two beds and we asked if the beds could be joined since we are a couple. The owner said he would join the beds while we were away but did not do so. We ended up doing it ourself. One of the days we were there, the owner told us the maid left and couldn't clean our room because we were in the room.

The owner Abdul Karin came and picked us up from Bab Boujloud which is the central square and the main entrance to the Fes medina. He had previously emailed us detailed instructions via email on how to get there and more importantly on avoiding some of the tourist traps if you are coming in via bus or train. There are a couple of scams which are going around where people say that your reservation is cancelled or the Riad owners are not to be trusted. In our case, the advice was helpful as we encountered some locals trying to misguide and cheat us at the bus station. Regarding the hotel, it was well kept and clean and the rooms are quite nicely done. Breakfast as a lot of reviewers have…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2015,3,"Nice, but part of the money making machine","We stayed in Dar Hafsa for two nights. Pros: The place itself is very attractive, breakfast was enormous, the owner came to meet us and show us the way, and they packed us up some food when we were leaving too early to make the regular breakfast time. Cons: the owners don't stay there themselves so you have to do things on their schedule when they're there, they seemed more keen on making sure they got their money than the welfare of their guests, the bathroom was an odd set up with the shower flowing round down to the loo. Finally, the owner sent us to two places - a tour of the medina, and the restaurant Dar Tagine, that were essentially just more expensive tourist traps. We didn't feel like they acted in our best interest, and more like they got a back-hander for sending…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The house is beautifully designed and you will never run short of different types of tasty breads for breakfast. Only possible advise to fellow travellers is to plan your tours and eating spots based on your budget and preferences (read up!). For example The owners daughter was kind enough to organize a taxi to volubilis and moulay Idris for 800 dirhams , however we managed to do it for under 250 Dirhams by taking the train and cabs which was relatively easy.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

That means they'll advise you with the real insider information. For example the daughter of the house told me were to find a hammam thats not for tourists but for fessi. Furthermore it is both very quite (situated at the end of a narrow road) and central (3 Minutes walk to the very heart of the medina). The roomes are nicely decorated, everything is perfectly clean.

The owner is extremely friendly and will give you great advice, greet you warmly in the morning and in the evenings and the other staff there were also great. The rooms are simple, but comfortable.

I ran into other trAvellers who told me about the colour coded trails through the medina--info they received from their dar hosts.

We had booked the double room and when we arrived Abdelkrim offered for us to stay in an even nicer room upstairs, for the same price! The riad is easy to find in the medina. We were given very helpful recommendations for restaurants and places to visit, and we had a lovely time. The riad only has three rooms so it is quite intimate. Make sure you check out the terrace which offers a lovely view of Fez. We definitely recommend Dar Hafsa !",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2015,5,Fantastic Dar woth exceptional breakfast,"We spent 2 happy nights in Fes which were made all the more enjoyable with our hosts' knowledgable recommendations. We found the dar easily,a short walk from the main gate. The rooms were spacious and comfortable with a the best working shower I have come across in Morocco. The breakfast was larger than most dinners we have been served! I would certainly recommend this dar to my friends and family.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2015,5,"Not just a Dar, it's an experience! Already booked to return!","We experienced such wonderful hospitality from some of the most amazing hosts we have had the pleasure to meet! They went above and beyond to show us good restaurants, and even negotiated the price before we ate! The dar is beautiful, authentic, and rooms are very nice, and the cost is so low for the value. The hosts met our taxi right outside the gate, and it's very easy to find once you've been shown the way. They also arranged for a top notch guide to take us around the city. In addition to great stories about the history and culture of Fez, he also helped us buy a carpet at near cost price, that would have cost us 3 times more if we purchased it on our own! Definitely stay here - we have already booked to return for another 2 nights this weekend!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,"Fantastic, hospitable stay","One of the best hotel stay experiences I've ever had. Abdul-Karim, the owner, is extremely hospitable, helping with excellent food recommendations and things to see and do. Riad is absolutely beautiful and affordable, great to see someone who cares so much his guests, would strongly recommend to anyone heading to Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Excellent - welcoming and knowledgeable,"We stayed here for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The room was lovely and all the staff were friendly, knowledgeable and spoke excellent English. The hotel is a short walk (about 10 minutes) from the blue gates but can take longer if want to peruse the lovely stalls in the Medina. We were met and escorted (including luggage transport) to our hotel on our arrival in Fes (quite useful in the Medina!) They even collected our sunglasses from a shop where we had lost them. They sorted out our guide for a day - ensuring he was official and that we weren't cheated. Breakfast was awesome - the biggest selection we had in morroco! Basically they really looked after us and ensured that we had a great stay. Overall excellent value for money.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Excellent ! Great value for money.,"Great location in the hearth of the Medina, easy to find after the first time. My wife and me, we stayed in Dar Hafsa four nights from March 23rd to 27th. Our room was in the ground floor, it was not so big but very clean and with a very comfortable bed. Wifi perfectly working even from the room. Breakfast delicious and huge. The owner, Karim and his family are incredibly friendly and helpful, they make you really feel like at home. Highly recommended. We would definitely come again to Dar Hafsa if we will visit again Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,2,Disappointing,"Although it looks nice, I found it far from the Fès Medina main entrance. The stairs to the room that were proposed to us were uneven, high and you have to be cautious when you walk up. Better visit before you book. Small rooms with two simple beds, tidy though, but not so welcoming. I did not find the owner nice. He kept arguing and showing signs of nervousness/defensiveness when we expressed our discontent regarding the location and after visiting the room. Then, he insisted that we should pay for the first night before retracting somewhat himself but not so clearly. We choose however to pay (out of peace of mind). Next time, I'll be more cautious when choosing a hotel from feedbacks looking too positive !",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Great location and very friendly,"We stayed 3 nights and felt like home in Dar Hafsa! We were contacted prior to arrival and got some suggestions on how to get to the place. Everything worked smoothly and we got picked up at the main gate to the medina. A welcome mint tee was a very nice refreshment - and we got plenty more of the great tea during our whole stay. The breakfast (which was included in the price) was delicious and very filling - including fresh orange juice and the great mint tea. Locality of the place was also very convenient, just few steps from the heart of medina, yet in a quiet side alley. Our room was in the ground floor, with a private bathroom - very clean and tidy, with extra covers if we would get cold. The place itself is a very nicely decorated traditional house which is run by a very…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Greatest care and hospitality !!!,"Our first stop in Morocco was Fez and Dar Hafsa. We were met the moment we stepped out of the taxi and were treated like family immediately. We were put in the right direction for buying SIM card, food, bus tickets and guides for day trips inside and from the medina. We are traveling on a budget and needed a quality, safe place at a comfortable price. I believe living in the medina is the best way to experience the history & culture of Fez. The family type atmosphere, experienced owner and huge breakfast will set one up for a wonderful experience. We can not recommend this place more.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Local Royalty,"We found Dar Hafsa on trip advisor and what a find it was. It was our first time in Morocco and had no idea what to expect. We were looked after like royalty, it was amazing. Felt like a local as the owner showed us where to eat while making sure we were happy with the price and checked for any food requirements. Organised the perfect walking guide who had lived in fes his whole life. Racheed, a top character and I would highly recommend doing a day out with him. A true local gentleman. The staff go out of their way to make sure your experience of fes is one to remember. It's such a change from the accomodation service you normally get. Also the breakfast is one that will leave you feeling full but you can't resist it. All in all I would highly recommend Dar Hafsa to everyone.…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Highly recommend for an warm welcome to Fes,I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone travelling to Fes. We were made to feel very welcome and the owners really went out of their way to make sure we had an incredible time. They arranged chaperones to and from dinner for us when we arrived knowing that we would be easily lost in the maze of the medina and escorted us every time we needed to get somewhere new. We also had an excellent guide arranged which made the most of our time in fes. We are very grateful to everyone at dar hafsa for making our trip so enjoyable and relaxed.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The 600 years old house is nicely decorated , it is clean and the beds are very comfortable. Free Wi Fi in the house, main car park area just 10 minutes from the Dar.The location is amazing . All the staff are very nice and friendly. There are many areas of attraction and historical land marks nearby ..old mosques and ancient souk within the old city is something very unique. Many traditional resturants are located not far from the Dar . The level of security is very good ..and the atmosphere in the old city take you back to the 8th century when the city was built.

 March 2015,5,Incredible experience,"We stayed 4 days in Fes and it was the highlight of our trip! A big reason why is Dar Hafsa! Located in the heart of the Medina, right off the main street, it's the best Dar/Riad/B&B I've been to. Their willingness to help and make your stay as perfect as possible is touching! From picking you up at the Gate, helping plan your tour of the Medina, finding great places to eat and other hidden gems, they go above and beyond! The Dar itself is quiet, clean and beautiful. Breakfast is great, lovely rooftop terrasse overlooking the city, confortable beds, just perfect! Enjoy the mint tea! I will defintely comeback someday! Marie",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,Best Place in Town!,"We booked Dar Hafsa after reviewing all the comments on Trip Advisor and even after seeing all the positive reviews, we were still blown away by how friendly, nice, helpful they were!!! We stayed 3 nights (on our honeymoon). The breakfast is included and delicious! The prices are a true bargain! The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. The Dar is well maintained and very clean and the staff are so kind and generous. Dar Hafsa was so helpful in advising us on where to go, what to eat, how to plan your days. They found an official guide (Nardine) who was great in showing us all the beauty of the Medina! They booked a taxi van so we can go visit Meknes/Volubilis on a day trip. For each restaurant we went to, either Dar Hasfa escorted us to and from the restaurant or an employee…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,"""Beautiful Riad , attentive host""",This is a very nice place. The family who run Dar Hafsa are incredibly nice and very genuine. It is very well located. The beds were comfortable and clean. What really makes this place special is the owner. he went out of his way to make sure everything was just perfect. There is a roof terrace with a beautiful view of the medina. I certainly recommend it.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2015,5,In the heart of the Medina,"This is like all small hotels in the Medina, not easy to find, but the proprietor will meet you at the popular main Gate, Bab Boujloud. Once you settle in, there is no way you could be lost again. The hotel is like a bed and breakfast, and is family run. The owners served us tea when we arrived, and by chance, we were upgraded to a nicer room at no extra charge. This charming hotel was a private home, now redecorated into four guest rooms ,each with its own bathroom. The owner speaks many languages. There is also a roof top for enjoying the view of the city. I think in the warmer seasons, perhaps they serve breakfast there? The breakfast is a feast, many dishes, I could not eat half., for example, fresh orange juice, eggs, pain au chocolate, croissant, bignet, 3-4 kinds of…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2015,5,Excellent choice,"You can't go wrong here. Abdul is an outstanding host taking a personal interest in the comfort and enjoyment of every guest. He is enthusiastic and passionate about Fes, his guest house, and his country and hopes his guests can share some of that too. He can arrange many different excursions to amazing places in the Fes medina and to other sites by auto. My wife and I really enjoyed our second honeymoon at Dar Hafsa.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2015,5,Charming guesthouse in the center of the medina! Excellent!,"If you find yourself in Fes, you must stay here! The building is beautiful and located on a quiet street in the medina, but only a ifew steps away from one of the main streets. But what makes this place so great is the owner and the employees! They met my friend and I when we arrived and walked us to the guest house--even though we arrived at midnight! Then they helped us book tour guides and a private driver. They make you feel like you are at home!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2015,5,Amazing!,"Beautiful place, incredibly helpful and friendly staff, great location and a wonderful visit! Owner helped organize everything for my friend and I, including booking a tour guide for visiting the Fes medina, a private driver for a day trip and personally escorting us to various places in the medina and giving us clear directions. Highly recommended. If you want a truly amazing visit to Fes, you must stay here!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2015,5,Very friendly and helpful,"We stayed in this hotel 4 nights and we are very satisfied. The hotel is very beautiful and traditional,breakfast was a unique experience :) the owner and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.

Never hesitate asking them for help :)",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2015,5,a wonderful base to explore Fez,"Situated in a beautiful old converted Road in a side street in the Medina, Dar Hafsa is a great place to stay. The rooms are very beautiful, decorated in a traditional Moroccan style, the staff are very helpful and present 24/7, helping with directions, airport transfers, day trips. There is a roof terrace for great views of the Medina, and breakfast is included. It is located just off the main road from Bab Boujeloud to the Kairwan mosque, about ten minutes from the gate, making it easy to find when you are lost. Will definitely come again.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2015,5,a quiet oasis,"You must stay at this Dar if you vist Fes,it is fabulous! Great welcome,lovely Moroccan style rooms built around a courtyard.breakfast is overwhelming with breads and jams with plenty of tea and coffee. Mint tea seems to be a constant habit in Fez and indeed in this old town house. Abdullah Karin and his family could not have been more attentive and and helpful. From advice as to where to eat to calling taxis and getting us a guide, he was full of humour and patience. We had a great adventure in Fez but this great quiet location was a relaxing oasis.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2015,5,What a gem,"We have just spent 3 super days staying at Dar Hafsa. This is a gem of a place run by a lovely family. Abdul and his family are so helpful in everyway. Nothing is too much trouble for them. The house is beautiful, clean, and breakfast is superb. It is right in the heart of the medina but is very quiet. A guide was organised for us and we had such a great trip round the medina and the main sites. Advice was given re restaurants and we really enjoyed Moroccan food and hospitality. We can really recommend Dar Hafsa. Wonderful.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2015,5,Central spot in the Medina,Very well located just 7 minutes walk from the Medina's main gate where you meet Dar Hafsa's owner Abdul. Fantastic service and warm welcome upon arrival. Tour guide service offered to guide you through the labyrinth. Would certainly recommend for a weekend stay.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2015,5,Beautiful place to stay in heart of Fes medina,"Stayed here for 4 nights this January. The place was cozy, sparkling clean and beautifully decorated. Finding the place was no problem as the manager met us at the taxi drop off and led us through the streets. The location of the riad is perfect - very central to main monuments, shopping streets, market areas, etc. - while still being quiet and peaceful inside. A great combination! However, it is the managers that really make this dar excellent. Because we arrived on a chilly day, they made sure our room was fitted with extra blankets and the heat was turned up in our room prior to arrival. They also got our laundry done efficiently. One other scenario also speaks to how excellent the staff are: before arriving in morocco I caught a cold and stomach bug. After a few days of…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2015,5,The best!!!,"I simply cannot say enough about how great the fine folks at Dar hafsa are. They provided amazing help getting around town. The room was SO comfortable and warm in the cold nights Fes. Breakfast was the most gracious that I have ever seen in Morocco. Folks were nice and chill here. There's only 4 rooms, so reserved early. The owner was very sweet on the phone while booking. Basically, this is one of the best options in Fes!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2014,4,Great Stay!,"I stayed here with my partner last year. I must say both owners (daughter and father) are great people and I would stay there again over the sumer. They looked after us, arranged some tours for us, and so on. The strongest point would be the breakfast (omg, so good!) and overall guest service. The only reason why I didn't give it a better rating is because it was cold in Fes in January and the heater wasn't really good. Also, although we had a private bathroom the shower floor was inexistent and although no major floods occurred it was kind of uncomfortable. Other than that I have really no complaints about it and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for an authentic moroccan experience :)",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2015,5,Highly recommended,"I arrived and spent five days with this wonderful family, the owner, Abdul Karim, his beautiful daughter Miriem (and a special mention to Eunice the Night Porter who was there late in the evening and first thing in the morning and always enquired as to how I slept the night before). Getting here was relatively easy. Once I had booked, I received an email from the owner explaining the way. Simply get off the train at Gare el-Fez (Fez Central Train station) and catch a petit taxi to Bab Boujeloud (often written as Bab Bou Jeoud) which is the main Western Gate to the old Medina. That cost 30 Dh (AUD$4). Then use a public phone to call Dar Hafsa (05356-36702). Either Abdul Karim, Miriem or Eunice will walk out to collect you and guide you back in, no matter what time you arrive. …",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 December 2014,4,Very comfortable stay in Marrakech,"This was an incredibly charming hotel, it was small, quaint an decorated in a lovely Moroccan style, it really did feel like a home. To get to it, if you are coming from the blur gate walk down the Main Street of fes, very easy to locate (just a small veer to the right from the blue gate immediately) and follow is road for 10-15 minutes. You will eventually come to an arch with leather goods being sold around the arch and a broken western u ion bank sign just last the arch in the right. Take the right turn just before this arch and follow this street until the door is in your right.

 November 2014,5,Great Place To Stay,"I was a little apprehensive booking this hotel having never been to Morocco before. But was pleasantly surprised at the warm welcome from Eunice (the night porter) despite our arrival not being 'til midnight. The hotel was a nice peaceful sanctuary in what is a very busy medina. our room was spacious & very comfortable although the bathroom was a little basic (but we where in North Africa). Our breakfast was amazing, plenty of home made breads with a selection of honey & fruit dips as well as cheese, eggs. Excellent!!!!!

Dar Hafsa met my every wish. The dar has 4 colorful rooms (all with good wi-fi) wrapped around a cozy courtyard filled with couches and decorate with elaborate tilework and plaster carvings. The owner, Abdul Karim, is the definition of warmth and hospitality with a twinkle in his aye and always a smile and ready laugh, who went out of his way to make sure we had the best tie possible.

 November 2014,5,Our Sanctuary within the Medina,"This ""Das"" or house was one of the best parts of our trip to Fes. It is a peaceful sanctuary within the bustling medina, steps from one of the main roads of the medina. But once you're inside you feel the cool tranquility of the house. The service is impeccable and Karim is willing to go the extra mile for his guests. We had wonderful breakfasts the 4 days we were there and we could go to him with any question or clarification about the right places to eat and shop. The first day we had booked a tour and when he asked who it was with and hadn't heard of the guide he was concerned and coached us for how to avoid buying things at the shops that were owned by the guides friends. When he saw that our guide was an officially licensed guide he relaxed. That's the kind of active…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2014,5,A Memorable Time,"Our first time in Fes Morocco and thanks to Abdul Karim and his kind people, our four night stay was a memorable and fun experience.

 October 2014,5,Great and Perfect Hotel,"I went in a trip beginning with Chefchaouen then Fes and at last Marrakech (Ourika) , my staying in Fes for one night in DarHafsa was a great experience , i recommend it for every one . try to ask DarHafsa people for any info you may need, they always provide helpful information, when you walk in old city of Fes , do not ask any one for any information because you will pay for it.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2014,5,There's A Reason,"For all the great reviews of Dar Hafsa. I wish I could add a lot more to the hundreds of 5* reviews, but it's pretty much all been said. Since good beds and good wifi are important to me, I can say that I was completely pleased with the quality of the beds and the fact that in the most distant room from the router, my internet connections worked perfectly at all times. I should also mention that the A/C blew very cold and the shower and bathroom were excellent. Also, they are located fairly close to the Blue Gate, but down a quiet street, thus making for easy access to the action, while also providing an peaceful escape from the scene. Although I didn't spend much time watching TV, I don't think I've ever stayed anywhere with so many channels....Yemen? No problem. Libya,…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Abdul Karim spent a lot of time talking with us about Fes and our trip in general, arranged everything we asked for, and gave us great tips for our next destinations. All the staff here are lovely and show a lot of concern for their guests. Fes can be a very overwhelming place filled with scammers so we appreciated the honest advice and service.

 October 2014,5,Everything you need,"Dar Hafsa is a charming traditional Moroccan townhouse in the medina of Fes. For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, the medina is definitely the place to be and Dar Hasa is located well to act as a base for exploring the medieval heart of Fes. The accommodation itself is excellent value for money; it's on the value end of the price spectrum but still has key features like full AC and wi fi. It's nicely decorated in the traditional Moroccan style and the breakfasts are a sight to behold. Can't fault it for the price. Our host, Abdul, did everything he could to make our stay pleasant, from sharing his local knowledge, to arranging restaurants to meeting us at the edge of the medina.

Tip: try to catch a sunset on the roof deck – it was gorgeous. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. The family who runs the guesthouse was so kind and welcoming, and they truly made our stay a special one.

We were only staying for two full days and three nights. We checked in the wonderful room and Karim showed us the view from the roof terras. It was late at night but Karim arranged a boy to pick us up and bring us to a lovely restaurant where we had some great food.

It is a relatively small, simple, beautiful 600 year old family house near the main street of the old city. Abdul Karim and his daughter Miriem run the business, and you could not wish for more pleasant and helpful hosts. The atmosphere in the house and rooms is charming and quiet. The facilities are simple, clean and adequate including a private shower, television and air conditioning.

 September 2014,5,A gem in Fes,"A welcome antidote to the culture shock most travellers experience on entering the medina, Dar Hafsa feels like an oasis of calm, quiet and comfort.

The rooms are well decorated and very clean and the breakfast is a feast.The excellent official guide Fouad which the riad organised made navigating the maze of streets a fascinating and rewarding experience.

The breakfast spread was fun with so many Moroccan breads, tea and watered down juice (beware of the water). The rooms comfortable and traditionally decorated. There's a small terrace overlooking the medina rooftops. Don't let them hire you a ""guide"" from the tourist office, though. That was a crook and waste of time.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 August 2014,5,True Moroccan Hospitality,"Esccelent-not just good. The owner knows the importance of keeping his guests happy and go above and beyond help. He helped us find and confirm our pre-booked restaurant using his laptop. When we wanted to visit the medina, we sought for his advice to hire a tour guide just from the main gate(bab boujloud) as they were plenty of them there but he suggested not to have any guide but to call the tourist office to send an official one to avoid problems. So,we searched on the internet for a tourist office number. we ran into him to call them for us and he was happy to do so We weren't disappointed, our tour guide was really funny and very knowledgeable. As the riadis family own, owner's children were very helpful and hospitable. The riad itself is beautiful, Well decorated.…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 November 2013,5,Lovely family dar...,"If you are deliberating over whether to spend more and stay in a fancy riad or save a little and stay in a friendly dar, opt for this lovely family dar. We're so glad we did. Firstly, the location is so easy to find (in the midst of one big maze, this is very useful!) The owner met us at the Blue Gate and guided us to his dar, pointing out signs to help us with our bearings for our future exploring. Secondly, the dar is beautiful. The internal courtyard is colourful and some of the rooms have pretty shutters with painted design. We were upgraded to the larger room with three beds, really pretty fabrics and it was great having the three internal windows. The bathroom was basic but clean and functional. Thirdly, the hospitality was fabulous. Father and daughter were always on hand…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Beds are super comfortable and feel new. The cleaning is to a high standard and breakfast is delicious and plenty. Hosts are accomodating and very professional. Excellent advice even given before arrival. We were picked up from the main gate and guided to the hotel. Fes can be overwhelming but just trust the people and listen to local knowledge.

There is clearly history in everything. Furthermore, the quality of some areas have been renovated and provide cleanliness/modernism to a high standard. But mostly the building has maintained its heritage. Breakfast is an experience in its own, we felt spoiled by the choice and attention given by staff. The pictures say it all. The roof terrace is to a good height which means u can see across the whole city. Sunrises and sunsets are great to view from here. Staff advice and recommendations on trips are worth listening to.

My brother and I are staying here for 5 nights and the experience has been incredible (we have 1 night remaining). I've never written a review before checking out of a place which tells you how positive my experience has been. As others say the riad is very well located, reasonably priced, and clean, but what really makes this place truly special is the owner, Karim. Karim has gone out of his way to make sure we've been well taken care of by helping to arrange side trips, inviting us for dinner with the family, and even ensuring we were able to make an exchange on a purchase we weren't quite happy with. I've never had an innkeeper care so much before! The whole family is lovely and I…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2014,5,A truly great experience!,"From the moment my girlfriend and I touched down in Fès airport - we were treated with warmth and kindness from the Dar Hafsa family. Not only do they show you the ropes, they will help prepare / organise any trip or experience you have in mind! The best part of our whole time at Dar Hafsa, was being invited to break the fast with the family during Ramadan - a truly unique and wonderful Moroccan experience. (The soup was better than any restaurant we went to!!) The beds are great, the breakfast is good, the location is good, and the price is very favourable. What more could you ask for! And above all this they invited us to watch the World Cup and drink tea with them whilst we were there. 10/10!! Very happy young travellers",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2014,5,Most Amazing Nice Family and Hotel in Fes,"Dar Hafsa is a small family run hotel in the heart of the old city Medina in Fes. This hotel has definatly been the highlight of our trip to Morocco. Karim (the owner) is incredibly hospitable, he made us feel like part of the family as he welcomed us into his home. He also gave us lots of great advice, he's not out to rip you off like a few other people around Fes. When you arrive, he invites you in to the common lounge area for some tea (delicious) and asks you what your plans are for your trip. He will advice you on things to do in Fes and the surrounds so you can have the best possible experience of Morocco. He tells you where best to go to avoid getting hasseled and what is a good price for things you may want to buy. He will also organise tours for you with genuine…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2014,5,Budget Riad in the heart of the Medina,"I selected this riad for a three night stay in Fes, for my sister and I on our first trip to Morocco based off of emails with the owner and other reviews. The owners emailed me back promptly each time and answered my slew of questions. We chose to set up a taxi with the riad, and despite our flight getting in late the taxi driver was there waiting for us. We drove as close as we could to the medina/riad (it is not accessible by car), and a minute later the owner met us at the taxi and brought us to our riad. After showing us our room we were served mint tea. While the riad is down a side street of the medina, it is very easy to find off the Main Street of the medina, a minute and a halfs walk. There is also two or three convience stores to buy water and a western union directly…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2014,5,A great trip,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Dar Hafsa. I was slightly nervous about my sister and I traveling to fez alone but we have had a great experience thanks, in part, to this riad. Located off one of the main streets of the medina, it is very easy to walk around and the blue gate is only 10 minutes away. The riad was clean and the staff was very helpful. When we first arrived we all had mint tea together, which was delicious. The owners were able to answer all of our questions and gave many recommendations. Although we did not take all of them I appreciated the advice. His daughter even did henna for us when we asked. For someone who did not know the city and who are young women traveling by themselves all of the information they provided was helpful but if you are more of an…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The Dar is a meticulously renovated house rich with carved stucco, painted woodwork, and tile detailing. Comfortably arranged and meticulously clean bathrooms with ample hot water. Good beds. Good WiFi connection. The breakfast was a lavish array of varied breads and pastries, plus orange juice and tea or coffee. Our host arranged an excellent guide for our day long tour of the medina (you cannot do it with any thoroughness in less) and offered to arrange more tours for us, but we were out of time.

Fez is an amazing place but extremely confusing and the staff helped out with locations and a guide for the day. The staff were very friendly, the owner who's name I've forgotten picked us up from the blue gate after our driver got us lost and helped us find a place to eat on the first day. He also set me up the TV to watch the football when I couldn't find anywhere else in the old town. Idrissi, the younger girl, was very helpful as well and we talked about Fez, phones and even traded books before I left. In terms of the place, I saw a couple of awards about it being the best small hotel in Africa while I was there and it certainly lived up to it. it was very clean, homely and better than the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Makes it almost easy to wake up in de morning! The people of Dar Hafsa will make sure you enjoy your stay and are extremely friendly. Make sure you try the Moroccan tea here!

Our desert tout driver dropped us at a wrong meeting place, so the riad owner's father who picking up was super angry when he saw us... but the other day, he's fine. However, the riad owner (the daughter) was too serious, she ORDERED us to sit at the table for breakfast even we prefer another (no other people at that time). and she ordered us to step on the stairs quietly at 8:xx in the morning in a rude way (we didn't make loud noise indeed), her ""attitude"" gave us very bad feeling...

It's clean and has all the expected amenities: free wifi, comfortable beds, plenty of places charge phones and laptops, and even a delicious free traditional Moroccan breakfast. One of my favourite things was the rooftop. It has an open-air sitting area, shaded by a white awning supported by a metal structure wrapped in vines.

The owner goes went out of his way to ensure that our two days in Fez were as satisfying and productive as possible. Both the driving and walking tours he arranged were exceptional. While we were skeptical of the dinner recommendation, we were quickly proven wrong (best meal in Fez meal, 500 durhams!).

Ten very different types of bread (with jam, honey, butter, and cheese at your choosing), along with a boiled egg, olives, fresh orange juice, coffee, and AMAZING tea kept us going…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2014,5,"Best hidden gem in Fes, cannot wait to stay here again!","Having never been to Morocco, I was really nervous. Luckily, we chose the best place to stay! The entire staff was so helpful and kind, and truly went above and beyond for us. The manager booked wonderful excursions for us at great prices. Both the excursions were great. The rooms were beautiful and the entire riad is done in a lovely moroccan style. The room was incredibly clean and comfortable. The riad could not have been in a better location either! Not to mention the delicious breakfast every morning! We were helped and guided in every aspect of our explorations in morocco and they could not have been more helpful. I absolutely have nothing negative to say about this place and would recommend it to anybody. My only regret is not staying longer!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2014,5,Excellent service,"I'm writing this in my room at the Dar right now. My husband and I have stayed here for the past 6 nights and tonight is our last night here. It's an excellent experience staying here - we have everything well taken care of, by Karim and his family/team. We didn't get to plan much prior to our trip as we were busy with our wedding preparations, so we were really thankful for the suggestions given by Karim. He helped us book our driver and also suggested when we should visit each place given the weather forecasts. As such, we got to explore some very beautiful places in Morocco. We travel often and the family-styled hospitality we received from the Dar is exceptional - it's as though we've made some good friends in Fez! We will surely stay here again if we visit Fez again! …",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2014,2,All talk no action. Rude staff,"Manager was rude.When we left he snatched the Maid's tip from us out of her hand and said '70 dirham, is that all.' Shower squirted water and soaked the bathroom,light in room didn't work, no hot water on first day, set us up with a rip off tour guide who was constantly sleazy all day (charged 40 euros when going rate is 30). Manager constantly interrupted us when we spoke, listened in to private conversations, told us off for talking in common area at 8pm because guests were sleeping, every time we asked for tea it was a chore even though he was drinking it in front of us and pouring himself teas. Wouldn't stay here again. Breakfast is good and room is nice but it was dark to the point we couldn't see anything at night. He said he would get it all repaired but didn't in the 4…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2014,5,"""Excellent""","Despite we didn't have opportunity to live in this riad, but I was deeply convinced it was a nice hotel in Fez. My girl friend and I was delayed to arrive this riad one day than our booking date and unfortunately this place was full booked that day. After 10+ hours driving from Sahara, we were too exhausted to find out the other available hotels at that moment. The oweners of Dar Hafsa were so nice. They provided us free wifi to find the hotels. Moreover, they helped us dial the other 3+ hotels for the space without asking any money. That's so different compare to other Morocco ppl. We were so appreciate for their will treatment and recommend this hotel to all of you.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2014,5,Best place to stay in Fez,Based on TripAdvisor reviews we decided to stay in Dar Hafsa when in Fez for a night. We were welcomed at the medina and escorted to this beautiful dar Hafsa... we were very happy with our stay here and extended our stay.. its really dar(house with lovely team of people) hafsa and made us feel really at home.. we took the team's help to get a tour guide. We again enjoyed a whole day of tour around medina and best part was that we never felt tired. . All in all an excellent and memorable experience. Highly recommended.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2013,5,The gem of Fes,I find myself writing about this gem of a riad once again. I was able to spend a few days here again last december. The place still retains its charm of being a cosy traditional house in the medina. Mr Karim and his team are always there to help you out. On this visit helped me to find traditional food and medicines that I would have spent ages trying to locate. I was able to save both time and money! All in all I would definitely stay here again.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2014,5,"Lots of Character, Helpful and Friendly Staff",This riad is very nice and very affordable. It's conveniently located in the medina. Hospitable staff was helpful with directions and recommendations as well as with teaching us how to make an authentic Moroccan mint tea. Good wifi connection was also a big help.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2014,4,Recommended,"The staff are very accommodating - making tea, cleaning when you wish, giving you help with directions/recommendations for Fez. It is located near the Blue Gate/main gate of the Medina so even if you are bad with directions you should be able to find your way back. It is a comfortable space. May need a bit of an update with lighting and heating, and the washrooms are quite small (shower is essentially above the sink) but overall, comfortable and close to main gate, while being inexpensive. Breakfast is very unhealthy/lots of pastries, but it’s big and fills you up!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2014,5,beautiful,"The place is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are very nicely arranged, full of color an warmth. The service is very personal and kind. And the breakfast will leave full of energy and happiness, it's a fact. Thank you for it all.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2013,5,Highly reccommended,"The whole family welcomes you to their small, but beautiful, guesthouse. The rooms are individually decorated and have a lot of charachter and are very comfortable. Being on a small side alley in the medina it is very quiet, but within a minutes walk of the hustle and bustle of one of the two main streets down from the Blue Gate so easy to locate. Karim can organise excursions if you wish and makes you feel totally at home, and the hardworking Mariam is always at the heart of things, and seems to answer your emails almost before they are sent! The breakfast in the morning is extensive and sets you up for the day very well!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2013,5,"Gorgeous Riad, Great Hospitality, Amazing Value!!",Really beautiful Riad set in a perfect location for exploring the magical city of Fez. The owner and his family went to every effort to ensure our stay was as pleasant as possible. The breakfast was particularly good and the roof terrace was a great place to sit and absorb the atmosphere after a long day. Would definitely go back!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2013,5,Traditional Fes made easy,"I've had a few years experience visiting Fes, and using Dar Hafsa as our home base made for one of the best trips yet. The location is excellent: in the centre of the medina, but easily found off the main road from Bab Boujloud, so easier to find your way back than other places I've tried. The hospitality is excellent, very helpful but not too pushy, and the best breakfasts I've had in any hotel or B&B, so you can head out for your daily adventures with a full belly. Rooms very clean and comfortable, with a great view from the roof (it's well worth it to set the alarm for dawn, get a few photos from the roof, then get a few more hours sleep). Highly recommended.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2013,5,Really Great experience,"This was my first time in Morocco, and I had a great experience and a large part was our Host at the Dar Hafsa. The Hotel was beautiful and had everything we needed. We had two rooms and they were very clean and so comfortable. The hotel has wifi bathrooms in every room. The hotel is located in the perfect part of the Medina. Our family, 2 adults 3 children, were very comfortable and well accommodated. The breakfast was lovely. Our Host arranged so much for us. He even took the time to teach me how to make Moroccan tea. I would recommend this place to everyone. We felt special and very secure.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2013,5,Legendary hospitality and kindness.,"The incredible hospitality I found at Dar Hafsa has been unbelievable. From meeting me at the gate of the Medina more than once so that I would not get lost, to arranging a tour of the Medina with an excellent guide and out to Meknes and the Roman ruins at Volubilis with a first- rate driver, to helping me out with unexpected financial problems, I have been overwhelmed with kindess from Kirim, Myriam, and Mohamed. The dar itself made me feel I had stepped into one of Scheherezade s 1001 nights. I slept wonderfully, enjoyed a hot shower, and ate delicious breakfasts -- perhaps 10 different kinds of bread, juice, cheese, olives, goat butter, jam and honey. All beyond belief0",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2013,5,Very helpful host!,"Lovely place within easy reach of the blue gate. Karim was kind enough to organise a trip into the desert for us which worked out a lot cheaper than the companies we had seen online. He booked us a driver who showed us lots of interesting places and views on route and a nice place to stay in the desert region plus the camel ride and night stay in the desert. Great trip I would recommend it to anyone coming to this part of Morocco. After we got back we stayed another night and woke up to a lovely breakfast of various breads and pastries. Karim could not have been a more helpful and welcoming host. Good stay, great value!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2013,5,a little slice of heaven in the medina,"We had the great pleasure of staying at Dar Hafsa while we were in Fes . It is a charming little oasis in the midst of all the wonderful chaos that makes up Fez. Our hosts, Kharim, Mohammed and Mariam were delightful, warm, funny and helped us in so many ways from meeting us at the gate to the medina to ensure we didn't get lost , to delicious mint tea , a great breakfast every morning and many helpful tips on navigating the city. The Dar itself is beautifully decorated, immaculate, well situated and well priced. Our heartfelt thanks to our hosts for all the hospitality and hope to see you again inshallah!

 November 2013,5,Beautiful old world guest house,"We found excellent reviews for Dar Hafsa on Trip Advisor and booked a room for three nights. The reviews were absolutely correct! It is a clean, beautiful, well kept guest house in the center of the old city (Medina). Breakfast was huge and good and the staff is outstanding. They are friendly, helpful, interesting people. The staff is fluent in several languages including English and French. Very helpful. I have no complaints or even suggestions for improvement. Stay here, you will be very satisfied.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 November 2013,4,Great Location and Very Welcoming,The owner and his staff are very friendly and know the area very well. The owner also offered to come meet us near where we parked so he would guide us to Dar Hafsa. We enjoyed the days we were able to stay here. Note: Cash only,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2013,5,Great hospitality and location in Fes Medina,"We loved staying here. It is a beautiful and very comfortable riad in the Medina of Fes. The best part was Abdul and his family. They all speak very good English so communication via email and when we were there was easy. This made a big difference. Abdul Karim, the owner, was incredibly helpful with advice and answering our questions and helping us with where to go and what to see.We enjoyed chatting with him and his daughter and son. He sent a taxi to meet us at the airport and met us at the Medina gate and took us to his riad through the Medina alley ways. Breakfast is huge and delicious. This was definitely one of the best places we stayed at in our six weeks away.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2013,5,"Beautiful Riad, great location and wonderful business owners.","For a student like myself--I was looking for a place to stay in Fes that was moderately cheap but classy. This riad was everything I could have asked for and more. My friends and I were treated so well when we arrived, literally it was as if they rolled out a red carpet for us. I felt as if we were treated like family, we were taken to the roof top terrace and served tea to discuss our stay. I explained my situation to our host--my friends were going on a four day tour that I could not afford and needed advice on an alternate option. The owner of the Riad took care of me and set me up with bus tickets, accommodations and more. I am so thankful for him and the staff at the Riad. The riad was beautiful inside just like the people that work there. I recommend this Riad…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2013,5,"Fantastic location, helpful hosts","Highly recommend this super comfy riad in the heart of the old medina. You cannot beat the location...minutes from the main entry, the Blue Gate. We were able to call from the train station and the owner met us at the Blue Gate to show us to the Riad, which would otherwise be very tricky to manage for newcomers to the Medina. We stayed in Room 3 - upstairs with great firm beds, and only very minor ambient noise that one expects from a riad - in fact the hosts are very careful in the morning to be quiet during breakfast to respect all guests who may be sleeping in. The riad is on a very quiet street otherwise. We very much appreciated how helpful and ever-present the owner, Karim, and his daughter Maryam were to our needs - offering directions to anything we wanted to see. A…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2013,5,Fantastic Guest Houst!,"You can tell from the other reviews that people love this place. If you are staying in Fes, stay at Dar Hafsa. Accommodations. The rooms are basic but offer a great place to rest your head after walking the medina. The place is small by American standards (such as they are) but it is beautiful. I especially enjoyed hopping up on the roof for some awesome vistas of Fes. Services. The friendly family running Dar Hafsa offers a feast for breakfast that should not be skipped. This was the best meal of my stay in Morocco. Honestly, you might want to stay at Dar Hafsa just to eat here in the morning. Getting there. If you grew up in the medina of Fes, it should be easy to find. For everyone else, good luck! Tell the owners when you will be arriving and they will arrange transport…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Nothing to say but Great!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2013,5,You can't get a better bang for your buck...,"This guesthouse is located inside the old Medina, conveniently close to one of the main entrances (the Blue Gates). My husband and I didn't get into Fes until well past midnight. Knowing that we'd probably have troubles finding the old Medina, let alone the guesthouse inside the old Medina, we'd made arrangements with Abdul Karim, the owner, to get from the airport to Dar Hafsa. Sure enough, when we arrived, there was a taxi driver waiting for us. He drove us to the Blue Gates of the old Medina (15 euros - which we later learned was a good fare because when we left and hired our own taxi, it was 20 euros) and from there, we were greeted by a friendly teenager who helped us with our luggage and walked us directly to Dar Hafsa. Even though it was now close to 2AM, Abdul Karim…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2013,5,Great location and great service!!,I stayed at Dar Hafsa with my girlfriend and brother for two nights. We were greeted at the gates to the Medina by Karim (very helpful owner of the Dar and has lived in the old city of Fez his whole life). It was great to sit and relax on the rooftop of the Dar which overlooks the beautiful old city and enjoy tea with Karim while he explained the intricacies of the medina. The service is absolutely flawless and the brekky was top notch! I will definitely stay here again and recommend to all my family and friends who ever get the chance to stay in this amazing city.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2013,5,amazing time...,"I stayed at this fabulous place with my brother and his GF for 2 nights. The breakfast we had each morning was delicious, and the man who runs the show is very welcoming and is always available to help you in any way you need. He met us at the gate where our taxi dropped us off, made us tea on arrival, showed us where to get the best food and experience the culture, booked our tour, aswell as our transfers onto chefchaouen.

 October 2013,5,Amazing Dar in Fez,"My husband and i just enjoyed a wonderful three night stay at the Dar Hafsa in the medina of Fez. Our trip started off great by us being personally greeted at the gate by ABDUL Karim, the owner who walked us back to the Dar and ensured that we made our way through the maze of the medina with great ease. Upon arrival at Dar Hafsa ABDUL Karim showed us to our room where we were able to drop off our bags and then proceeded to take the time to give us a complete tour of the Dar as well as briefly explained the history of the medina to us from the lovely rooftop terrace.

 September 2013,3,Uncomfortable Stay - Disappointment of Our Trip,"While the location is nice, it's not worth the fake kindness and rude treatment from Dar Hafsa's proprietor, Kareem. We arrived late to Fes after driving 8 hours from the Erg Chebbi in the Sahara, and Kareem rudely told our driver over the phone that he wouldn't meet us at the Medina gate if we arrived after 10pm. When we met him at 9:30pm, he greeted us and proceeded to walk incredibly fast way ahead of us through the steep, crowded, winding streets of the Medina, leaving us to fend for ourselves in trying to keep up and keep him in sight. We were 3 women with 2-3 bags each, exhausted after a long travel day, and he didn't offer to take even 1 of our bags! When we asked if we could have the complimentary mint tea in our room since we were beat, he replied, ""That's not part of…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2013,5,"Wonderful, gracious hosts, beautiful accomodation","Our stay at Dar Hafsa was the best of any of the places we stayed in Morocco on our trip. Kareem met us at short notice to show us the way, organised a guided tour of Fez for us and was always on hand to help us with anything and everything. The twin room we had was clean and neat and had everything that we needed. Breakfast was delicious with lots of variety and very, very generous portions. Both Kareem and his daughter were the most wonderful hosts and our stay exceeded our expectations. I would highly recommend Dar Hafsa to other travellers.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2013,5,Real hospitality in peaceful spot,"Dar Hafsa really understands hospitality: balancing the warm welcome with mint tea on arrival, the lucky upgrade, beautiful rooms, the wealth of info and advice and the fab breakfast with leaving plenty of space to its guests. This made our two nights there before travelling onwards a fabulously relaxing and enjoyable start of the holiday. Afterwards, popping up out of the blue without reservation after our Moroccan journey, we found the rooms fully booked (and deservedly so). Despite this, Kareem and his family made the time and effort not only to find us alternative accommodation for the night but also to arrange a 5am taxi to the airport the following morning.

As a girl traveling alone, I did appreciate the location. The twin room I choose was nice and comfortable, with Fan, AC and private bathroom. The lady who was working there at night was also very kind. The breakfast is your chance to taste all those different breads that you see everywhere in Morocco. The rooftop terrace is also a nice place to catch the breeze and relax.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

We arrived via overnight bus at 5am and were given great instructions on how to get to the hotel. They even allowed us to check in early at around 8am and gave us a superior room at no additional cost to accommodate our early arrival. The breakfasts are absolutely amazing, around 10 types of pastry's and breads to try including the famous Berber ""whiskey"" aka mint tea. The location is great, right in the thick of things inside the Medina, but in a quiet spot just off the main street.

From the moment we arrived in Fes we were met at the main gate by the nice and charismatic owner Abdul Kareem who kindly walked us to the Riad and gave us a brief introduction to the city. The hotel itself is a beautiful guesthouse in a secluded street, away from the noise and hustle of the Talaa, yet conveniently located close by. The room was nice, clean and the aircon worked a beauty in the scorching heat of August. What makes this place special is the owner Abdul and his staff.

We shouldn't have worried! Even before we arrived to Fez, the owner answered any questions very promptly through e-mail, arranged a pickup from the airport and welcomed us at the entrance to the medina to guide us through the winding alleys. Dar Hafsa itself is a great little quiet oasis very close to the main streets of the medina (i.e. it is easy to find your way back after exploring the souks.)The room we stayed in was spacious, air conditioning and wifi worked without a problem, and breakfast was very, very generous.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable, fitted with air conditioning, and the rooftop terrace offers an awesome view over the medina.

There is a beautiful view of the roof tops from the rooftop terrace and the breakfast was good and very large. Khareem is a fantastic host and he helped me book a two night trip to the Sahara and the Todra Gorge. He organized everything and took the hassle out of my short stay in Fez.

 June 2013,5,Perfect place to stay in Fes,If you're looking for a place to stay in the old Medina in Fes then look no further. Myself and my girlfriend stayed here at the beginning of June 2013 and we have never felt so at home in any hotel throughout our travels. The owner Karim treats you like one of the family and you can tell from his friendliness and enthusiasm how much he loves Morocco and wants you to love it too. We arrived and were collected from the airport and then met at the gate by Karim who guided us through the streets to the house. Once there we were treated to tea while Karim suggested a place for us to eat that evening and booked us a table. The restaurant he sent us to was a beautiful hidden house deep in the Medina that you would never find unless you had a guide (which was arranged for us). Overall…,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2013,5,Nothing was too much trouble,"My brother and I stayed at Dar Hafsa for 3 nights in June 2013. The owner - Abdul Karim was incredibly friendly, helpful and the perfect host (as were the rest of his family) We were only there for a few days, and so didn't have much time to explore but with their help, we really made the most of it. The trip was a surprise birthday present for my brother (he only found out we were going to Morocco on the way to the airport) and so we had no plans of what to do when we got there. Our host arranged for a taxi to pick us up from the airport, a tour guide for both days and plenty of advice and tips for things to do whilst we were there. We might have saved a few pounds by finding our own guides and haggling, but we definitely wouldn't have had as good a time. As for the the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2013,5,"Perfect, calm place to stay in the middle of the medina!","My boyfriend and I stayed for four nights at Dar Hafsa and could not have asked for a better place to stay during our trip to Fes! From the moment we arrived in Fes the owner, Abdul Karim could not have done more to help us. He met us in person at the Blue Gate and guided us through to Dar Hafsa- which is brilliantly located on a quiet side road off the main street, only about a 5-10 (if you walk slow like us!) walk. The guesthouse itself is beautifully decorated and our room (on the ground floor) was lovely and peaceful an also kept very cool- which is very welcome after a long walk in the medina! There is an air conditioning unit in the room if you like but we did not find we needed to use it. Abdul helped to make our trip in Fes the very best it could be- recommending us…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2013,5,Very good find,"From the moment we arrived to when we left the staff were excellent. We were told the best places to go and the owner put all the effort in to arrange things for us. This was especially helpful in a city as large and confusing as Fes. Neither me nor my girlfriend are bad navigators but if it was not for the help of the owner we would have been lost for sure. The room was very nice and comfortable. It managed to feel luxourious yet be affordable at the same time. The breakfasts which are included were very large, with a wide range of pastries to choose from. The view from the terrace is simply breathtaking. You could be excused for spending the whole stay up there. In short you will certainly not be dissapointed if you stayed here.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2013,5,Fantastic Place to Stay,"Dar Hafsa and its owner, Abdul Karim, could not have been a better fit for myself and my two grown children during our stay in the Medina. I chose it base on the Trip Advisor reviews but was thrilled to have our experience far exceed our expectations. We were personally met at the main gate despite our late arrival hour (12:30AM) and walked to Dar Hafsa through the quieting streets. Abdul Karim spoke with us along the way making us feel instantly comfortable. We had agreed in advance not to hire a guide, but when he asked us and explained why it might be a good idea (35 Euro for the entire day) we all changed our minds quickly. And he was correct. 9000+ winding alleys with no markings or points of reference make it impossible for a visitor to find their way in one day. Not to…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2013,5,Great stay during Fes festival,"I had a great time in Fès, and Dar Hafsa's staff played a key role in this. Besides offering a great place to stay, they also gave us very valuable advices and arranged everything for this trip to be perfect, from arranging a guided tour to recommending nice restaurants. Thank you guys!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Fantastic stay,"My 4 nights stay in Riad Dar Hafsa in Fes was a fantastic experience. The place is very conveniently located in the old medina about 5 minutes walk from the Blue Gate, a few minutes walk from tanneries and places with souvenirs and restaurants are abundant nearby too. The riad is very clean and well looked after with a beautiful decor throughout. The room was spacious and cosy and had all amenities, breakfast was delicious and there is also a roof terrace in the riad overlooking the medina with a beautiful view. The place overall is a hidden gem with a very good value for money. But the most pleasant thing about it is the host who gets out of his way to help you and assist you with his answers to any questions and requests you may have. I have never met a more polite and kind…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Amazing time!,"Our experience in Fes was made all the more amazing by Karim and his lovely daughter Mariam. Staying in the beautiful Dar Hafsa felt like staying at a favourite uncle's house! Waking up after a comfortable and quiet sleep, you can expect to be greeted with warm smiles and a great breakfast. Karim is very knowledgable about the city and will recommend you the best places to eat, sites to see, and places to shop. He helped us organize the rest of our trip and made sure that we had an authentic and very pleasant Moroccan experience. Dar Hafsa was very clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated - not to mention in a great location. Coming back to genuine, warm smiles after a long day of exploring Fes made all the difference - they are truly happy to go the extra mile for their…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Perfect for old Fes,"Knowing that spending a week in Fes is quite a challenge we deliberately chose Dar Hafsa on the basis of previous reveiews recommending it for its convenience for the old Medina and for the helpfulness of Karim and his family. We were not disappointed! The place itself is perfect, just off one of the main market streets with its shops and cafes. Karim and Mariam are perfect hosts, ready with advice and all the help you need (and a cup of tea when necessary!) including where to shop and the best places to eat. They also organised two day trips with a car for us which enabled us to get out and see some of the surrounding area. Old Fes is a great experience but quite daunting for the unitiated. It takes a few days to properly attune yourself, especially to walking around the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Wonderful stay in Fes,"For 2 college girls travelling to Morocco for the first time, we were unsure of a safe, comfortable place to stay but we are now so relieved that we chose Dar Hafsa. It offers excellent accomodation for budget prices. The place is beautiful and clean and even has a rooftop terrace overlooking Fes. The owner is very sweet and gave us many insider tips about the city to avoid trouble and tourist traps. He went out of his way to guide us himself to local shops and gave us great restaurant recommendations for low cost delicious traditional Moroccan meals. I would recommend Dar Hafsa to anyone travelling to Fes who wants to feel like they are at a home away from home.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Fantastic! Warm and welcoming!,"Karim and his daughter helped us sooooo much! A warm helpful welcome went their extra mile for us! Such a calm soothing atmosphere in the hotel, very charming place and clean! Great place to stay with family or friends, very safe. They are truly lovely hosts. Highly reccomend to stay here in Fez and in a good location. Karim and his daughter are 2 people you will remember and appreciate even after you leave Fez!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Very hospitable!,"Dar Hafsa was like a haven as soon as we had entered. Mariam and her Father Abdullah Karim were very much helpful!! We were two girls, and he had taken care of us and made sure we were taken to our correct destinations. Very hospitable, definitely recommend!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Brilliant Dar ran by a kind and generous family,"My wife and I spent two weeks in Morocco, and Fez was by far the best city we had the chance to experience. Although you need a life time for Fez alone. Karim and his daughter from Dar Hefsa were very welcoming and allowed us to really get a sense of the relaxed fassi life. The Dar himself is amazing, beautifully renovated by the owner, with excellent hygiene standards, and well located off tala sghrira, which makes exploring the medina at any time of the day very easy (especially after one of the copious breakfasts in the dar). I would recommend asking Karim for any information about where/who/what and how in fez. He is very patient and helpful. He was also useful in setting us off for the next leg of our journey to Essouira. If you want a place in Fez that makes you feel at…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Home from home,"It was our first time visiting Morocco and the family-run Dar Hafsa riad was an ideal intoduction to the country's famous hospitality. Visitors are made to feel so welcome that you might get the impression that you are staying wih a favourite uncle rather than a businessman. Copious glasses of mint tea are accompanied by friendly and essential advice about Moroccan culture and what to do (and what not to do!) while in Fez. The riad itself is beautifully decorated and the rooms are first rate. Breakfast is a real treat and even the most ravenous traveller would be hard pushed to finish it all. To top all this off is a roof terrace with a great view over the surrounding area. With regards to location, you couldn't ask to be closer to the Medina and the cities main attractions…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Excellent Dar in the centre of Fes - fantastic value,"Fantastic location with beautiful Moroccon decor in this Dar tucked away down a quiet residential alley. Lovely rooftop garden to look out over the city. Very clean and tidy and lovely room with great ensuite (very good shower). There are four guest rooms - I would recommend asking for one of the higher rooms. Karim is a great host and goes out of his way to make sure you are happy and can organise taxis, tour guides etc. Impressive breakfast with mix of breads and pastries. Great value, location and atmosphere - highly recommend. Went with a friend and it was perfect as a base.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,Very homely riad,"Highly recommend this homely riad. Beautifully decorated in traditional crafts, materials, fabrics throughout, with roof terrace with great view across the medina to the hills beyond Fes. In a quiet location in the heart of the medina, a true oasis. Excellent value for money, welcome mint tea upon arrival and fabulous breakfast. Thank you Karim and family for a wonderful stay in Fez.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2013,5,One night was not enough.,"Our train from Marrakech was 6 hours late (accident delay) getting into Fes. We were dead tired at 11pm so I can't tell you what a welcome sight it was to see Karim, the Riad Dar Hafsa owner, waiting for us at Bab Boujeloud Gate ready to escort us to his riad, a 5 minute walk away. The riad has been in his family for 130 years annd you can tell he and his family take the upmost pride in making sure everything in this wonderful establishment is as perfect as it can possibly be. Unfortunately for us the Dar Hafsa was fully booked past our initial first night. But Karim came to the rescue again, personally took us to another impressive but well priced riad a short distance away and made sure we were happy in our new digs. Great riad, great people, and very well priced. Give it…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2013,5,With Karim you are in good hands,"The hotel itself is lovely, a minutes walk from the hustle of the medina. It is clean, quiet, and elaborately decorated. The best part if staying here though is the owner Karim, who throughout your entire stay works tirelessly to make sure you are happy and informed about where to go, what to see etc. As part of a two girl group it was really reassuring to know we could ask Karim anything and that he would look out for us, advising us where to buy jewellery (out in the desert), organising a trip to the Sahara with safe reliable people and describing the local delicacies even get his daughter to take us to the local hamam. I would recommend to everyone, Karim and his family are truly wonderful people.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2013,5,Best value and experience,"A great riad experience in the heart of the medina, but away from the noise of the ""commercial"" hustle and bustle. Karim and his daughter were wonderful hosts, proving cultural insights into Fes and Morocco, advising us for our activities, organised an official guide for the medina when we requested and were just happy to chat with us any time. Also, the communication when we booked and before our arrival was extremely helpful, eg, beware of 'touts' on the train to Fes. This warning meant we were prepared for that to happen - which it did! Karim also met us at the gate when we arrived and led the way to the riad. Breakfast comprised an incredible variety and kept us going all day. This dar was the cheapest dar/riad we stayed in during our two weeks in Morocco, yet provided one…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2013,5,Excellent introduction to Fez!,"I would definitely recommend this Riad. New to Fez the owner (Karim) was fantastic at making us feel comfortable and welcome. As two girls travelling alone the first few days in the busy medina can be quite daunting but Karim went out of his way to make sure we got the most out of our stay, visiting the tourist hot spots as well as experiencing some of the hidden gems of the medina. The hotel itself is lovely, clean and comfortable with a great view of the medina from the roof top terrace. The breakfast is equally good and very filling! Wanting to see the desert Karim arranged for us to meet with a local,family ran tour provider to organise our trip, which we really enjoyed. Karim treats you as one of the family and we would definitely return to the Riad should we ever return…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2013,5,Home away from home,The Dar Hafsa feels like home. Kareem and his staff are more than willing to give advice and any help they can to make your stay the best it can be. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. All come with a private bathroom. The breakfast is especially excellent. Giving you all the energy you need to explore the medina and souks all day. My stay here made the time I spent in Fes even more enjoyable. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a home away from home.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

For this price range we were absolutely amazed!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2013,5,A gem,"If you find that you are going to be in Fes and are looking for a great economical place to stay look no further than here. The place is family run and by the time we left we felt like a welcome member of the family. The owner could not have been more helpful from meeting us at the gate to walk us to the place, which is not difficult to find after that, to giving us directions to wherever we wanted to go. We've eaten breakfasts in many places in Morocco since we stayed here but none has lived up to what was offered here. WiFi available in your room, English spoken",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The rooms are comfortable and the excellent breakfast in the ornately decorated home was a treat. The terrace upstairs was nice to look out from at night. Wifi and the attentiveness of the service was excellent to have. Dar Hafsa organized a taxi/guide for us to tour the countryside.

Great stay, my only complaint was lack of toilet paper. Only the owner knew where the toilet paper was.. So uncomfortable night!! Other than that brilliant hostel!! About the tour...unrelated to the hostel. I will warn you that if you get a tour guide he will take you to lots of shops and truly encourage you to buy things for commission. We KNOW the true prices of the items. We went with a marocan family to a market in Rabat and paid 50dirham for a great quality tea pot. I.e. Local price... Fez... For the same similar design teapot.. 200dirhams So haggle AT LEAST half off... They'll still make a killing. Bear in mind the average salary is 2000 dirhams..that's.200…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2013,5,"Nice place, pleasant hosts","What makes this place great are the hosts. Abdul Karim and his family took care of us well. We felt well staying at the riad, which felt like their home. They were helpful with their recommendations and directions. For example they told us about the perfect way to see the tannery, without falling prey to the local hustlers. The airport pickup for 15€ they arranged was also a nice touch, and worth it. Abdul Karim was waiting for us at the gate of the medina where the driver dropped us off. Abdul Karim also offered to arrange tour guides and shopping, but made it a point about not being pushy. We actually ended up buying a carpet at a place he recommended, but only after we expressed our interest in going there the next day.

The staff being Karim (the owner), Maryam and Aziz (his children) and Mohammad were super helpful and made our stay as comfortable as possible-their hospitality and down-to-earth mannerisms were the highlight- accompanied by the traditional Moroccan breakfast that we feasted on in the morning. We were a family of 4 with 2 elderly persons who faced great difficulty in climbing up and down the steep and rickety stairs which were the reason for our cutting short the intended 3 nights stay to 1.

The hotel is a converted family home, and you are treated like family there. The owner is extremely friendly and helpful, and speaks very good english and french. He arranged a tour guide for a day for us from the tourist office (highly recommended) and gave us good restaurant recommendations. He also was able to change money for us at a good rate. In the mornings we were given a huge breakfast of tea, coffee, and 10 different types of bread and pastries. The hotel is somewhat rustic, with sparse bedrooms and old fashioned bathrooms. There is very little privacy. However, the hotel is very pretty inside, with beautiful tiled walls and floors plus a nice terrace.

Was in town solo to research for a group that's visiting later in the year and their knowledge, insights and recommendations were invaluable. Rather than just shy away and retreat to my room after a tired day out, I can't help myself in wanting to spend time with them to share with them my adventures, exploits, no matter how big or small. Room was cozy, bathroom clean, and though the way back to their place might seem daunting at first since its in the maddening maze of the medina but not even the most fabulous riads will lure me away.

 December 2012,5,The absolute best in service and kindness.,"I cannot say enough good things about Dar Hafsa. My sister and I stayed here in December 2012 and loved it. The owner, Abdul Karim, was the kindest, most knowledgeable person in the whole Medina and his children were a close second. The location of the hotel is splendid, a short walk from Babb Bougloud gate and very easy to get to from the train station by cab. My sister and I had some scheduling conflicts during our time in Fes and Abdul Karim could not have been more accommodating. The breakfast in the morning is delicious and hearty enough to provide fortification for a day of exploration in the Medina! Our only regret is that we could not stay in Fes longer to continue to enjoy the Dar Hafsa House's kindness.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 November 2012,5,FANTASTIC PLACE,we really thank the family dar hafsa for making us so welcome there . they have made such a great effort to make sure we have had a fantastic stay in fez . it's greatly appreciated and we will not hesitate to recommend to anyone visiting fez .,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2012,5,Excellent riad in the middle of the Medina,"We had an excellent stay at this riad at the end Nov/beg Dec. The breakfast is massive and you'll not need to eat lunch! It was quite cold but there are heaters in the room and lots of blankets (to be honest most places we went were cold except for much more expensive hotels which we certainly couldn't afford to pay for). The family are lovely - they picked us up when we arrived (we were exhausted from a very long car journey from our tour), they also helped arrange tours for us in Fes. We were poorly prepared for this part of our holiday and it was most appreciated that they offered advice and suggestions for what we could do. Would definitely recommend this place particularly if you're on a budget - it's a great location, great food and fantastic hospitality. If we go back…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2012,3,3.5 stars,"The location is great, right in the middle of the medina. The service is okay. Every time we asked for tea we feel like it is a huge bother for them. Also the biggest draw back is how cold the place was. They did not told us about the heater and we were there for 3 nights in the freezing cold...not fun.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2012,5,Excellent place to stay in Fes,"Dar Hafsa is a great riad to stay in Morocco. Run by a family, you can really feel at home here! They had a car picking us up and the owner was waiting for us in the square. Breakfast was great, a real moroccan treat. I will definitely come back!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 November 2012,5,A beautiful and peaceful stay in the crazy fes medina.,"I had a wonderful stay in Dar hafsa. Our host was a kind and very helpful and made us feel very safe and welcome. He helped us find a guide and made the best breakfast we've had in all our time in Morocco. We had a stunning terrace overlooking the medina and our room was absolutely spot on. We were also lucky enough to be the first to arrive that day so we got an upgrade to a larger suite. The best way to get there is to call the hotel from outside the medina's blue gates, the tall walls of the medina make it tricky to move round in there without getting somewhat lost in a city with over 9000 streets. Good luck with a map! a lovely stay, Dar hafsa is as good as everybody says. We will not forget the kindness that Dar hafsa has shown us. With many thanks and beat wishes. Enjoy…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2012,5,Place you can call home!,"This lovely Dar is in the very heart of the old medina and Abdul, Aziz and the whole family will make you feel like at home.

We've also enjoyed watching the football matches here...and what more can you ask? :) Very special place and very special warm-hearted people! You would want to come again!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 November 2012,5,Wonderful place to stay,"He Dar Hafsa is a small, family run hotel just one turn and a few steps off one of the main drags in the Fes Medina. The owner, Karim answered my e-mail about directions to his place immediately and told me to take a cab to the closest Medina gate and he would meet me there. A call to him from the RR station upon arrival and 10 minutes later I exited the cab and Karim shook my hand. The hotel is small but very clean, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. We had mint tea while settling with Karim and meeting his son who also helps run the place. Dinner was included on the first night which Karim's wife prepared and it included a delicious soup, chicken tandine, and breads. Breakfast was also included and featured coffee and a large variety of homemade breads and pastries with…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2012,5,A gem in the most intriguing city inthe world.,"The owner met us at the Medina gate and walked us to his hotel. At first you are worrried as you snake through the many winding paths of this ancient city. When he opens the door and you enter it is just startling. We were offered a choice of rooms and chose the one on the very top. It was comfortable, clean, and well worth the price. The meals were impressive and laundry was done while you visited the city. Excellent in every way. Kudos to the owners and workers. Also note that this building was started only 15 years after Columbus discovered America!!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2012,5,Fantastic,"From the first welcome to the sadness of saying goodbye, we were treated as one of the family.

 November 2012,5,an unforgettable experience,"Not only was is the best accommodation , but the best foodwe ate in all of morocco . real home cookingand better than any restaurant . think slow cooked chicken with almonds and a sause that makes your mouth water . tender lamb with sweet prunesto blow your taste . and the hopitality was second to none. we woke up to a freshly made breakfast everyday and sat on the terrace as the sun went down. an unforgettable experience.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2012,5,"Delicious food, comfy beds, friendly staff",I really enjoyed my stay at Dar Hafsa. It was the highlight of my stay in fes. It is clean and beautifully decorated. The owner had no problem letting us change our reservation as we arrived a day too early ( we miscalculated what date it was) We even got a free delicious home cooked meal on our last night. It was the best tagine I have ever tasted. The staff are very helpful. Thank you!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2012,5,Dar Hafsa Experience,"My stay at Dar Hafsa was nothing short of excellent. Beautiful, clean Riad with extremely friendly staff. Without even replying to an email asking if we wanted a meal on arrival we were treated to a beautiful Moroccan dish after arriving tired and hungry late at night. Helpful directions and suggestions on worthwhile sights made the stay in Fes even more memorable.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2012,5,Good hotel,"Very nice little hotel: good food, friendly staff who will recommend shops and restaurants in the medina. The staff will also come and meet you at Bab Bouljoud to show you the way to the hotel, which is very helpful because the maps for the medina are not very detailed.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,must stay,I and my friends really enjoyed our stay at dar hafsa . we spent 3 nights there and really it worths . the Riad is beautifully decorated with an authentic moroccan feel . the rooms are spotlessly clean . beds are comfortable . the breakfast was one of the best we have ever had in morocco . but the thing which made our stay the most enjoyable was the hospitality and the warmth shown to us by the familly who run dar hafsa . they were very approachable and very knowledgeable. they helped us in our arranging our tour to the desert which was really a good deal . they gave us the directions where to go .to do shopping and even to enjoy our time overall . we can definitely recommend dar hafsa to everyone who is visiting fez and looking for a nice place to stay.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,3,"Good experience, but needs to work on several things","We spent two nights at the dar. Location is good, in the medina, near one of the main streets. We had a room for 3 persons (although we are 2) so there was enough space. But the double rooms seem to be a bit small. The bathroom is like in India, which means that everything is wet after your shower, and you need to walk on the wet floor if you want to go to the toilets or if you want to go back to the bathroom to wash your hands. Not so confortable. Soap and shampoo are not provided by the owner, we had to ask, and he went to buy some. Breakfast is too heavy with average quality. Would be beneficial to decrease the quantity and increase the quality. Owners are nice people, but sometimes Karim is a bit too present (as said in other comments) !",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,Home away from home,"This is our first visit to morocco and fez , staying at dar hafsa was really a good start . we have been welcomed with a great hospitality by the owner and his family. The riad is really lovely and well decorated with oriental ornaments the room is very clean and spacious .We felt like this is home away from home rather than just being in another hostel here because of the kindness of the owner and his family who were always wishing to help .. complimentary mint tea was always available . Make sure to save appetite for the great free breakfast. I would definitely recommend it and go back here .",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,3,"Great in some ways, but some things need work","The dar is very well-situated in the medina - close to one of the exits, just off one of the main streets, but quieter so that you can have some peace and quiet. The dar itself has a nice traditional Moroccan look to it and feels more authentic than some of the more spruced-up riads that are run by Europeans. Our room was a bit on the small side (it was really hard to open our suitcases) and the bathroom, while big, lacked things like places to put your toiletries. Certain aspects of the bathroom needed more work (the toilet-paper holder was broken, for example), and I didn't like the open shower (so that while showering, you'll get water all over the bathroom, including the toilet seat). One complaint was that you had to request for your room and bathroom to be cleaned,…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,Hospitality at its best,We are two female travellers who arrived after 3 manic nights in Marrakech and 7hour train journey!We were met by Kareem who took my suitcase and led us through the street to the Riad. We were immediately impressed by the well kept riad and Kareem showed us the terrace straight away and our room was beautifully furnished and comfortable and best of all the bathroom had a door ( which was a welcome addition given our riad in marrakech had only a curtain! ) we were really hungry after our journey from Marrakesh and Kareem arranged for a younglocal to meet us at riad and escort us to the recommended restaurant where we enjoyed our meal.we were then taken back to the riad and slept very well. Karreem and his family really care about their guests and it was an extremely pleasant stay…,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,A wonderful experience,"From the moment we arrived in Fez we were made to feel welcome as Kareem came to meet us at the blue gate and guide us to the Riad - a welcome relief for 2 female travellers after a long train from Marrakesh. We were very pleased with our beautifully presented room and the gorgeous roof terrace, as well as the incredible breakfast feast we were presented with each morning! During our stay Kareem and his family made sure that we were incredibly well looked after, recommending places to eat and even arranging a tour guide from the tourist office to show us around (an excellent way of navigating the maze that is Fez whilst actually seeing the sights!) From start to finish we were made to feel like part of the family and would definitely recommend Dar Hafsa to anyone looking for…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,A good experience,"We had an amazing stay at dar hafsa . from the moment we set foot in the house we were carried away by the beauty of the architecture .however, what makes dar hafsa so special is the warmth of the family that run it . abdul and his family go above and beyond to make sure that you are enjoying your time not only in their house but also in fez , they truly made us feel that dar hafsa was our home away from home . i would highly recommend it .",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,What a happy experience for six days!,"The hospitality of Kareem and his family exceeded all our expectations, help with shopping and trip planning in particular. Breakfast was an extradinary sampling of ten or more traditional Fassi breads with all the beverages, cheese, honey and olives. Interesting conversation, respectful care all around. The quiet safe location was particularly welcome at the end of a long day.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,My new home in Fes,"After the madness of Marrakesh, it was a joy beyond joys to arrive in Fes. We were met at the medina gate by the owner and had a friend by the time we reached the hotel. Finding this guest house on TripAdvisor just reinforces my belief IN TripAdvisor. My wife and I have stayed in everything from shacks to chateaus around the world - this is the kind of quality and kindness that keeps us going. Also - our bathroom was bigger and better than the one in a previous Riad that cost triple. Fes is a treat. I just came back from a 20 minute walk to the bus station and back. Not once was I harassed in the medina. Not once. We will talk about the amazing breakfast until the day we die. Really. Get to Fes and let it undo the damage done in the Marrakesh's Jamaa el-Fna.

 October 2012,5,Great Place to Stay in Fez,"I had a really nice time with this family owned business. Absolutely amazing breakfast and really friendly service. Morocco is a different world and requires a different way of thinking. Originally there was a shock but the welcoming environment of Dar Hafsa helped to ease any concerns. Stick closer to the uptown Medina late at night and just be smart about things like any other big city. Ask for official guides, as some will take you to their friends and try to sell you things.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 October 2012,5,The most wonderful place to stay in Fes!,"The Dar Hafsa is a beautiful riad, located right in the Medina; owned by one of the kindest and most wonderful families I've ever met. Kareem is a very attentive and friendly host. From the moment we walked in, we felt right at home. We were welcomed with the most delicious mint tea; and had lunch at Sekaya, a restaurant we were able to find because Kareem was gracious enough to arrange for someone to walk us there. Also, we had some of the best breakfasts we've ever had. Besides the beautiful decorations and the outstanding service, the Dar Hafsa has a rooftop terrace overlooking the city, where you can sit and enjoy that wonderful mint tea that I had to mention again because it is so good!

The riad is conveniently located in the middle of the Medina, making it a great spot for exploring all the attractions in the Medina (all within walking distance). The map on their website was very useful for navigating through the medina alleyways to the riad. Our room was comfortable and very clean. The breakfast here is amazing! As you can see from some of the other traveller's photos. But the most wonderful thing about staying here is the hospitality of the family that run it, they really do so from their heart. They helped us with recommendations on where to eat, where to shop without paying tourist prices, helped me find a good hammam, helped us organise taxi to the airport. I would highly recommend this place to others.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Lovely, filling breakfast. Central location. What really made our stay was the hospitality of owner, Karim and his family. They were so welcoming and inclusive, they invited us to a party at their home, which was a fabulous, unforgettable experience.

I canno't complain about the Service, everyone was really nice and more than helpful, they helped us book a guide for the day to visit the Medina and He was great. The Breakfast was really filly as well and very good. There was aircon in the room (Twin beds room) which was great (some of our previous Riads didn't have). And the Terrace was nice too and helped to get a view over the packed Medina of Fès. However I was surprised that the Riad had a roof, usually in the Riads the Patio is open air.

The owner meets people from the Blue Gate, the entrance to the medina, to accompany them to the Riad. It has a beautiful, very Moroccan interior and the owner's daughter was waiting there and got us Moroccan tea. They were welcoming and warm, and we stayed there twice during our stay in Morocco and felt like we were returning 'home' the second time! And one of the highlights is the impressive breakfast in the morning. Oh, and the lovely roof terrace. And the warmth of the family. Definitely 10/ 10 and highly recommend.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

They really go above and beyond a 'hotel', you feel like you are a guest in their home.

 July 2012,5,lovely riad in the heart of medina,"i stayed at dar hafsa with a friend for one night in july the owner and his family were very kind, helpful and hospitable, they did their best to make our stay perfect and unforgettable one the breakfast was the best we have ever had during our stay in morocco,it consists of tea, caffée milke, oranges juice and seven types of breads. i would highly recommend this place.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,Wonderful hosts and fantastic breakfast,"Dar Hafsa is in a fantastic location in the Fez Medina and has wonderful views over the Medina. The rooms are lovely and offer all mod cons (air conditioning, TV ensuite bathroom). The two best things about Dar Hafsa have to be the breakfast and the Idrissi family who own the guest house. Breakfast is absolutely delicious with various different breads and as much tea or coffee you can drink. The Idrissi family are wonderful hosts and are very polite and friendly and extremely helpful. No request is too much. They will happily organise a trip to the hamman for you, or a day trip out.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,"Great location, lovely restored Riad","My partner and I stayed at the Riad at the end of July, we found the location, breakfasts and the rooms excellent. The family who run the riad have created a lovely place to stay, that has a real authentic feel. We found the family to be extremely helpful, they did not put us under any pressure to book trips, but in fact would walk us to the main path in to the Medina in order to show us which way to go (all this was free of any charge too!) The owner and his son were great, this was our first stop in Morocco and we both really appreciated all the advice they gave us- not just about Fes, but the rest of the country too.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2012,5,Nice riad at the centre of the medina,"My wife and I had a great time at this family run riad. To sum up our 2 night staying, we really felt as if it was our home, as the owner and his son have been looking after us the while day. Highly Raccomanded!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,3,A nice uncomfortable place,"We stayed a few days at dar hafsa. At first, we were under the charm of the place. The rooms are nice, the hotel is beautiful and the staff was very welcoming. But as the time passed, we figured out that the owner's kindness was not sincere. When you refuse some offers that he will make you (excursions, shopping), you will feel his disappointment which create an inconfort. And in the end, he will insist a lot that you write good reviews about his hotel. We were very disappointed that the nice hospitality that the owner tries to show is in fact only fake.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2012,5,an impeccable riad!,"I had such a fantastic time, the people were very friendly and welcoming. We stayed in a 3 bedroom and found it a comfortable stay. They provided great service and advice especially the son, aziz and the owner. The breakfast was a treat. I recommend this place for anyone :)",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2012,5,Great Dar in the Medina,Dar Hafsa is a beautiful Dar in a central location in the medina. The rooms were great and very comfortable especially after travelling for over 30 hours. The best thing about the Dar was the staff. The Dar is a family run business staffed by the owner and his children - all were very friendly and very happy to help with anything and everything. I would recommend if coming to Fes.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2012,5,Beautiful cosy Dar,"My friend and I stayed at the Dar Hafsa for 2 nights. We had no problems booking and organising our accommodation here. Upon arrival we were met at the entrance to the Medina and were escorted to the Dar, which is only a short walk from the entrance. We stayed in a twin share room, which was very cosy and importantly the aircon worked well. We had our on bathroom right next door. The room and bathroom, in fact, the entire Dar was very clean. Our room itself was very quiet, which was great. The traditional breakfast each morning was also very good. The family was very friendly and looked after us very well. Always full of good advice and making sure we knew what to avoid when wandering around the Medina. The Dar itself if only about a 2 min walk to the main strip through the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,Nice Riad in Fes,Traditional Riad in a beautifully restored house in the middle of the Medina. It is a small cosy place with four rooms only. The rooms have nice funiture and are clean. A nice longe where an excellent Moroccan breakfast is served. The staff was very friendly and helpful.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,4,"Excellent overall, but...","Dar Hafsa is a beautiful riad. Its rooms are comfortable, nicely decorated and there's a plentiful supply of hot water. Karim, Aziz and Mohammed were very friendly and always willing to offer directions and recommendations. The food was also delicious - the best I ate in Morocco. However, it should be noted that Karim appears to make a point of placing some pressure upon guests to write positive reviews. I heard him ask if he could read a review written by another guest. This rankles. Five stars minus one for pressurising guests = four stars.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,"Family atmosphere, friendly, well located","Our hosts were incredibly nice and attentioned. The helped us finding our way in the medina and recommended some very nice/good restaurants and shops. The place itslef is family owned, very charming & reakfast is the best we had in Morocco. Room are simple but clean, very good value for money.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,One of the best places we've ever stayed!,"This is a wonderful riad located right near the Blue Gate. The rooms are spotless, showers clean and hot water/ac worked perfectly. The best thing about this riad though is hands down the staff. They were kind, overly generous and hospitable, and made our stay in Fes easy, comfortable, and enjoyable. Even though they were observing Ramadan, at their 'breakfast', the first meal of the day, they offered us some of their sweets!The owner called the tourism information office for us, arranged a guide, gave us directions to everything, and even advised us on how to get to our next travel destination. We would recommend Dar Hafsa to everyone, you will definitely enjoy your stay.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2012,5,"We'll be back. Fantastic Location, Hospitality, Food, and Rooms.","Absolutely loved staying here, the atmosphere, the service, the food. The friendly family were amazing and caring, we felt safe, and the recommendations they gave were very much appreciated. It was lovely to come back from the crowded full on streets of the Fes Medina and feel so at home. I really can't rave enough about Dar Hafsa, I would absolutely love to go back, and would most certainly stay again.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,A great riad,My partner and I recently stayed here - a great riad. The service was impeccable and the rooms were great. We stayed in a twin room the first night because the double room was booked out. We then moved into the double room for two nights. The double room was as it appears on this site. There is even hot water! I'd definitely recommend it if you want an authentic riad experience.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,"Great Riad in the Fes Medina, offering great staff and service and an excellent location.","Friendly staff look after you while staying in Fes, and can advise and organise day trips, shopping, restaurants and anything else you might be looking to do while in Morocco. Highly recommended if looking for an authentic Riad stay.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,3,A little disappointed,"We had mixed feelings about our stay. While the hotel was very clean, beautiful, and had a great breakfast, we felt uncomfortable at times with the owner and his son. We were a little bit turned off when the son was speaking poorly about some nationalities (Russians and Bulgarians, for example). Also, they were both very attentive to our needs, but at times too much. While we wanted to relax, at times they were constantly watching us. Our last night, Kareem the owner invited us for a tea to say goodbye. We thought this was a very nice gesture, but instead of doing it out of kindness, he asked us to write an ""excellent"" review of the hotel online. Our last complaint was that while they were very good at giving recommendations, they seemed to get offended when we chose to…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,A Beautiful Experience,"Dar Hafsa is unquestionably a riad of the most genuine beauty. It eminates, first and foremost, through Kareem and his family. When you find yourself sitting in the equisitely renovated traditional Moroccan centre room (not sure of the appropriate terminology), which no doubt you will, it will feel as comfortable and warm as your own home. This is wholeheartedly down to the Idrissi family (plus another young Moroccan chap who works at Dar Hafsa and we must surely not forget) and their welcoming, informative, relaxed and cheeky manner. Might I say as well, you may find it hard at times to concentrate on the plethora of useful instructions being dealt your direction due only to the fact that you have found all around you is craftsmanship of the most sublime detail and beauty. Now…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,Not just a hotel but a whole experience! Just amazing,"If you want a Holiday to truly remember and cherish, then Dar Hafsa is the place to go to. I have been coming to Morocco for 10 years now and I have to say this place is one of the best stays I have had. I would never hesitate to come back here again in fact I am going to book a week at this place for next year from now. The owner of the place Mr Karim and his family are the best hosts you will ever experience in Morocco. They will treat you as if you are a member of their family and will really go out of their way to assist you. I am truly enjoyed my stay here and look forward to going back.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,Incredible!,"This riad is stunning in every way. We were welcomed from the moment we booked by a personalised email and then greeted from our taxi by Kareem. The decor of the riad is beautiful and the attention to detail incredible. Our room was spacious and clean and the perfect haven from the heat and husstle of the medina. The riad is family run and are all incredibly friendly. They were always there to offer help and advice, nothing was too much for them. On top of all this we were surprised by the enormous and tasty breakfast. This is a breakfast you have to try. I highly reccomend anyone to stay here!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,Great experience!,"The family who owns this riad is really, really nice and helpful. They sat with us to drink tea, showed us local places to eat, found us a great guy to tour the city, and the daughter took me to the local hammam. I loved the experience. The riad is clean and tide.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,Perfect place to see Fez for the first time!,"The service can't get any better. A very friendly family welcomes you and ensures that your stay in Fez will be nothing but great. They have served us an amazing breakfast (best one in Morocco), provided great laundry service, arranged for the best official guide (Asadin 06-63102536), and provided excellent advise thru-out our stay there. I would only request softer pillows (you will see what I mean when you get to Morocco) and to keep the A/C on during the day to keep the temp a bit lower during the night. Totally recommended for first visitors!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,Feeling like a family member,We (2 adults and 2 chidlren 15 and 17 years) spent 3 nights at Dar Hafsa. The location is excellent in the middle of the Medina. Our stay was great within the beautiful house with Abdul Karim and his family who looked very well after us. Breakfast was overwhelming with different Maroccean specialities and dinner as well. Special wishes like fresh fruits or a special tasty olive oil were arranged for us. We learned a lot about the Maroccean culture while talking to Karim or his children. The structure of the house supports meeting of Karim and other guests. We got a lot of tips where to go and how to reach. Sometimes we were even accompanied to find the way. We would like to come again to that great place and recommend it absolutely. It seems to us as a very authentic place.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,"A great building, host and experience","Dar Hafsa is a gem in Fes. After arriving from Marrakech somewhat tired and sweaty after a 7 hour train journy, we were calmly advised to take a petit taxi from the station to Derb Boujloud for 20 dirhams and were met there by Abdul Karim. He's a great host and showed us around the medina and recommended a local restaurant that had some of the best tagine kefta we had in our week in Morocco. He also organised visits to the tanery and carpet shop - we didn't feel obliged to buy, which is a bit of a rarity here! They were very flexible about us changing the dates of our stay and although we didn't get breakfast one morning as we were leaving at 7.30, on our last day we had a generous spread that kept us going until the flight home. A little on the pricey side for some but it's…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,3,"Ok in some aspects, but we wouldn't stay there again","Our stay at Dar Hafsa began in an unfortunate way. We had arranged by e-mail five days before with ""Idrissi"" (the name used in Dar Hafsa e-mails) to be picked up at the train station in Fes for a fee of 5 Euros (about 60 dirhams). We arrived at the train station at the agreed upon time but no one came to deliver us to the riad. After waiting for about 20 minutes, we took the advice of a local man in the train station who suggested that we walk past the taxis just in front of the station and hail a taxi across the street. We did that, and the fare to Bab Boujloud (the closest drop off point for Dar Hafsa) was 15 dirhams. Using a map from the Dar Hafsa website and carrying our luggage, we found our way to the riad (about a 10 - 12 minute walk through the medina). We were…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,Haven amongst the hustle and bustle,"We only had the pleasure of staying in the Riad for one night but were made to feel extremeley welcome from the moment we walked through the door. I called Abdul when we reached the Fes train station and he was waiting for us outside the Medina gate when we arrived in our petit taxi. The Riad is about a 10 minute walk with luggage down the main street on the Medina and then off down a small side road. We have stayed in a few Riads tucked away in Medinas, and this one has been the easiest one to find so far! We booked the cheapest room available however Abdul upgraded our room at no extra cost to a larger room as it was not in use. The Riad is beautifully decorated with rich colours and fabrics. The Riad has a nice terrace to see the rooftop views. Abdul called the tourist…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2012,5,"Great place, amazing friendly service!!","Dar Hafsa, is amazingly well run and by the friendliest of families you can find anywhere. They are so accommodating and wanting your stay with them to be memorable and it shows. Abdullah and his son and daughter were very nice, always helpful! They arranged guides, and also let us stay in the living room area, using the computer etc. until midnight after checkout so that we could catch our overnight train to Marrakech. Again I truly must say the hospitality is the best I've encountered anywhere! This is definitely a must stay location in Fes!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2012,5,Great Accomodation in the heart of the Medina,"This Accomodation was all organized and found on trip advisor. Abdul the owner and His family were by kind, and helpful.

I would highly recommend this Riad to stay. It was a real treat.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,Dar Hafsa - a home away from home,"Dar Hafsa was a great choice! The family atmosphere makes you feel welcome and at home. Abdullah Karim was a great host, and his son and daughter were also very sweet and helpful with any request or question we had. We felt very welcome and enjoyed every minute in this beautiful Riad. The breakfast was the best breakfast we could find all over Morocco! Very convenient location, beautiful and very clean rooms with large, private bathrooms. Very highly recommended!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,The only place to stay in Fes - wonderful.,"What an absolutely wonderful place to stay. I've travelled extensively around the world and have to say that Dar Hafsa rates as one of my most favourite places to have stayed. The family who run the house could not be more welcoming, kind and genuine. They make you feel at home from the moment you arrive - going out of their way for you at every opportunity - and leave you wanting for nothing. The breakfast is phenomenal (even for me - who can't eat wheat - they prepared me a gorgeous fruit salad every day). Don't waste your time looking for anywhere else to stay - you will not find better! Thanks so much Karim and your lovely family!!!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2012,5,Wonderful Moroccan hospitality,"Dar Hafsa – a family run riad is not your five star hotel but has five star service and location. Karim and his son/daughter team were very thoughtful and gracious. Karim recommended restaurants, places to see and arranged day trip and transportation to the airport. The most important thing is we felt we are at home with wonderful Moroccan hospitality. You will not be disappointed!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,A quiet oasis in the middle of the medina.,"The owner did everything he could from the moment of our arrival to make it as enjoyable as possible. He booked day tours and a 4 day trip to the desert, taking care of everything down to the meals and all at very reasonable prices. The hotel is beautiful and we felt at home the entire time we were there.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,A home away from home _kindness hospitality and friendship,"I came unannounced to the Dar Hafsa, without a reservation. Even though they did not have a room for me, the son came to get me. They offered me a lovely meal and then found me a place to stay nearby. The owner escorted me to the other Dar, helped me get setup and then walked me back to his Dar. We sat together and had tea while he called around to find me a tour guide. As I left he asked me to come back that evening to watch the football match. When I returned from a day in the Medina, he again served me tea and had one of his boys get me some dinner. My experience here was touching and heartwarming. Even though I offered, he would not take any money from me. Dar Hafsa is a genuine home away from home. If you are coming to Fes try and stqy at Dar Hafsa? it is a gem.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2012,5,Amazing stay at Dar Hafsa,We recently had the pleasure of staying four nights at Dar Hafsa. It's been an incredible experience. Karim and his family were super nice and attentive. They helped in any way they could. They organized a day trip to Volubilis and Meknes and even took us to one of the local hammams. It was amazing. It really was a dream to stay in this amazingly beautiful riad and to get to know the family. Definitely thumbs up!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,Perhaps the friendliest hotel in the world,"We really enjoyed our stay here. This was one of the friendliest accommodations we’ve ever stayed in (saying this after 5 months of continuous travel). Many people have told us to make ourselves at home, but here they truly made us feel like we were at home. There’s a nice terrace where you can hang out and take advantage of free mint tea, or comfy couches in the main area. It’s located in back alleys, so was much quieter than most riads we’ve stayed at. Dar Hafsa also had some of the very best breakfasts we’ve had in Morocco – around 9 different types of bread/pastries, plus olives, jams, and big bowls of fresh fruit mixed with yogurt. Would absolutely recommend this place if you're looking for a chill stay in Fes at a place run by superfriendly Moroccans!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,"awesome place, great service, really enjoyed our stay, breakfast is a must try (Complimentary!!!!).","We arrvived in Fes after a hellish 10 hour local bus journey. The service at dar hafsa was impeccable. A small family-run etablishment, the owner and his family made us feel right at home straight away. Showing us in from the gates, the owner Karim and his family welcomed us in with a friendly smile. Everything else was a dream.

Their home is aesthetically beautiful, clean and well-run. They are incredibly responsive to the needs and desires of their guests. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. When Karim heard that I can't eat wheat, he made sure that I had fresh fruit every morning for breakfast. He was happy to arrange tours and excursions. He even went to buy bus tickets for us when we couldn't go ourselves because we were on a tour. All this would be enough, but what makes this place really special is the kindness, caring and generousity of Karim, Aziz and Mariam. Karim took care to give us good advice about navigating the medina, and what to do to insure a safe and fun visit. He checked in…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,Wish I Could Give It A Ten,"Just spent four days in this jewel of a riad. It is family run, a father, son, and daughter team. They did everything possible to make our stay comfortable. They picked us up at the medina gate, set up tours both in fes and in the surrounding area, chatted with us about our days adventures, served us delicious foods, and made us feel as if we were a part of the family. The riad is absolutely beautiful and spotless, and the location is perfect, close to everything and in a very safe, well lit area. But above all Karim, Aziz, and Miriam made our stay wonderful. When I remember Fes, I will remember their warmth, their hospitality, and their kindness.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 June 2012,5,I recommend this place with all my heart,"If one were to read my other reviews you would see that I can be pretty tough. That aside, Dar Hafsa is truly a special place. The home is old and unique, but with all the modern amenities that a five star hotel would have. Abdel the owner, and his two children, Meriem, and Aziz( young adults) are always around for anything you may need. Abdel found us a great guide for the day for a reasonable price, and Meriem helped my wife find a fabulous spa at a fair price. Aziz, a university student was interesting and quite informative. They made our stay in Fez so special. I forgot to mention the panoramic views of the city from the rooftop terrace and the breakfast which was generous and memorable as well. After reading this you probably think that rooms are $300-$500 dollars…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 June 2012,5,giving 5 stars is too little,we - 2 adults and 2 teenagers - had a great stay. the best was the whole family of karim. they all went out of their way to make us feel at home. the home breakfast was like a buffet and tasted fantastic and when we requested fruits they were added immediately. dinner every evening was always home made. the best we had in morocco. the arranged tour of the jewish cemetry and the pottery factory was perfect. karim personally ensured that we did not loose the way. he also gave us great tips on where to go. it was wonderful to chat with his son and daughter on lots of topics. 2.5 days went off too quickly. if you are looking for something personal in a beautiful home then this should be your destination.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2012,5,A wonderful place to stay,We turned up at Dar Hafsa without a booking after a long night on a night bus and an online booking elsewhere that fell through. It was such a relief! The staff were wonderfully friendly and the room was clean and comfortable and the shower hot. We spend most of the day relaxing on the sun terrace and had an amazing sleep in the comfy beds. The staff recommended places for us to eat and shop and gave us directions to explore Fes. I would recommend this place to anyone!,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2012,5,"Friendly, welcome - the best we have found in Fez for the price","We have visited Fez many times over the past 4 years looking for somewhere that isn't expensive and offers clean comfortable rooms with a good breakfast and good service. We have stayed in 4 or 5 places and seen more than 15. This is the best place. The quality of the rooms, the service and the hospitality are great. The location is great as you can pop back to the Dar when you are tired midday and you are still in the centre of the Medina - many other Riads require a massive hill climb to get back - something you don't want to do when you are hot and tired. I will try to stay here every time I go to Fez.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Abdulla met us at the main gate in Fes and walked us to the Dar and immediately brought us to the roof top for the best mint tea we had in all of Morocco. The view from the terrace is gorgeous and a great place to unwind after a long day or to welcome in a new day.

 May 2012,5,An *excellent* place to stay in Fes,"I have nothing but good things to say about Dar Hafsa. The family that runs it is kind, helpful, and thoroughly knowledgable about Morocco. The rooms are comfortable and clean, with climate control and hot showers. Karim, the patriarch of the family that runs Dar Hafsa, is more than happy to recommend restaurants, organize tours of Fes or its environs, and keep a conversation going in four languages at once - all while keeping everyone's glasses full of hot mint tea. There is always someone from the family ready and eager to offer advice or keep one company in the lovely Dar Hafsa.

 April 2012,5,Great Experience,"The first experience that we had with Dar Hafsa was that we did not know where it was (we were new to the medina-style setup). One of the family members came to the main gate and walked us to their dar. Upon entering, the facility was amazing. There were so many colors and classic Moroccan patterns. We really enjoyed the enormous couch in the main room and sat on it every morning when we had our breakfast that came with at least 10 different types of bread. The family was really kind, willing to chat, and helpful (they walked with me to a store and translated for me when I needed to get some necessary medication).

 May 2012,5,Warm hospitality and great value accommodation in Fes,"My wife and I really enjoyed our time in Fes which was made all the more enjoyable thanks to a great choice of accommodation in Dar Hafsa in the heart of the Medina. We didn't know what to expect this being our first time in Morocco but our time in Fes was greatly enhanced thanks to the high quality accommodation and customer satisfaction and enjoyment focused approach of the family run Dar Hafsa. You couldn't ask for more: a great location in the Medina; fantastic value; clean well-furnished accommodation; a real Moroccan feeling; a warm friendly family environment; top advice on how to survive our ""Moroccan experience"" and a breakfast to die for! All in all we were truly impressed with Dar Hafsa and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality, good…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2012,5,Excellent hospitality in the heart of the medina,"From the minute we walked in, Dar Hafsa exceeded our expectations. For the price, we really only expected a clean room and warm bed. Instead, we were surrounded by a beautiful home and warm hospitality. The owner Karim and his family went extremely out their way to make us feel welcome and the location in the heart of the medina can't be beat. They also suggested (but did not push) activities that we should do in Fes and obviously love the city. Last but not least, the breakfast. What a spread! The seemingly endless Moroccan and European treats finished off with mint tea and coffee was the perfect way to start the day. One note, Karim always seemed to have recommendations for activities in Morocco as a whole so if you plan on staying it might be worth getting recommendations…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2012,5,"Beautiful, small, family run hotel in The Fes medina.","Dar Hafsa was quite a pleasant surprise. On a quiet residential side street just off the main road, this is a small jewel-box of a family run hotel. The owner and his children are incredibly gracious and kind hosts, fluent in French and English as well as Arabic. They have obviously spent a lot of time, money and effort in restoring the beautiful tile and zellij work interior, and keep it sparkling clean. The rooms are surprisingly spacious (especially compared to our tiny but pleasant one in Marrakech). The breakfast spread is a bountiful treat. We would not hesitate to stay here again and send everyone we know.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2012,4,"Good value for money, feels like you stay at the people's house though","If you want to be completely immerged in deep Morocco and the medina, go for this place. If you want to have some intimacy, you should consider staying elsewhere. Positive points are: the price and what you get for it and the fact that it is situated deep in one of the medina's street so noise from the actual Medina is limited. Breakfast is good although with no fruit and this is surprising giving the fact that Morocco has a lot of these to offer. I would recommend offering less pastries and adding some fruit to the breakfast. Also the riad itself is small but well restored and traditional. The family owing the riad is nice and over present which means that you inevitably interact with them every time you walk the front door of the riad. They actually spend the whole day there…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2012,5,"Great, honest people with a lot of enthusiasm.","We stayed at dar hafsa for two nights and everything about it was perfect. It is owned by the people that run this riad, and they do a great job servicing your every need. It is located close enough to the middle of the medina so you can access all the important places (university, tannery, cupper and bronze crafting square, etc.) But also close to the main gate where you have access to the restaurants and taxis to go to the new city. This hotel has an amazing breakfast. Overall had a great experience and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean, very friendly, and enjoyable place.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2012,5,The perfect start to our trip!,"If you are looking to experience a traditional morrocan riad look no further! I stayed here for 2 nights with my boyfriend and another couple and truly enjoyed my stay. The riad is recently renovated and its beautifully decorated mosaics and painted doors do justice to the meaning of riad, wich translates as "" small palace"". Karim, the owner, and his family were very helpfull in answering our numerous questions about fez, morrocan culture and in providing advice to plan the rest of our trip in Morroco. Myriam was as nice to take us along with her to the public hamam and arranged for us to be taken care of of. She also helped us to find good stores when we wanted to do some shopping. Location wise, the riad is a 2 minute walk from the main street in the medina. However it is in…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 April 2012,5,Best service in the city,"First time in Morocco, we felt very welcome. Good communication beforehand. Picked up at airport, brought to the riad by the owners son, Aziz. Very clean, neat rooms, good shower, beds and toilets. Mr. Hakim (owner), Ms. Meriem (daughter) and Aziz (the aforementioned son) helped with everything, getting us very good prices, guiding us to places, helping with hammam visits and more. They even found us a guitar so we could play in the desert. We stayed 3 nights total, I would blindly recommend this riad to anyone (please be advised that ALL houses in Fez have high stairs, so book the main floor room if you have bad legs). Breakfast at Dar Hafsa is wonderful, by the way. I don't think I had better or warmer service anywhere else in the world than at this riad.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

Friendly, gracious, great breakfast, excellent mint tea, and wonderful conversation with hosts and other guests. When necessary, Karmin and Miriam are there to offer suggestions, advice, and provide that extra service that a vistor desires. The location is excellent, easy walking distance to everything. For the older female traveller, feeling safe and secure is important - particularly in a place as surprising as Fes. Dar Hafsa delivers. I felt completely comfortable staying here. Breakfast was a true introduction to Moroccian hospitatlity. The rooms were provided comfortable beds with ample space to relax.

It's not the most elegant of accomodations in Fes - I will leave that to the 5 star hotels that cater to the haut gam tourist and the large moneyed tour groups - this is comfort, quality, value, and amazing location, all packed into a B&B that has only 4 roorms. Talk about personalized service. You will get to know your host, his kids, his wife, their neighbors like old friends - and when you leave you will know that you have had the opportunity to do something extremely rare - see a place up close and extremely personal.

 March 2012,5,Everything I was looking for..,"With trepidation, I travelled to Fes alone and was looking for a place that would ""take care of me"" in way that a hotel would not. Dar Hafsa met all my expectations and more. As arranged, they met me at the Blue Gate and escorted me to their charming place; they immediately made me feel at home, allowed me free access to their computer, provided me with a knowledgeable guide to the city (Nadja) and found other Hafas residents who would share the cost of this. They answered all my questions with infinite patience, served me tea at every opportunity. I enjoyed their breakfasts (though as a low carb person, they presented a bit of a challenge). Also loved the delicious, cozy dinner a few of us ordered in advance. Because of the nature of Dars with their rooms situated around…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The riad looked beautiful but a man claiming to be the owner took us to another riad along the road. Although they knew that we had been on a local bus for 10+ hours he waited until he walked us to the top floor with our bags before he told us the price. This riad was of a much lower quality and he wanted to charge us the same price. When I queried it he screamed and shouted and insulted us. I would have normally voted with my feet by my friend wanted to stay as we were already tired, frightened and intimidated. So we paid the money.

It's obvious that the father is very proud of what his family has accomplished here and there are many awards from booking agents to highlight their commitment to great service. The rooms are very well decorated, the beds fantastic, the showers hot and everything was really clean.

The hostel owner is a local family with high-level language ability, including French, German, English, Spanish, Arabic, even a little Hebrew. Except the sumptuous breakfast and warm mint tea, a good conversation with the family tells you lots of knowledge on the tradition, the culture, and the religion. 5 star, no doubt.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

It’s an easy location to find in the old medina, with access to shops, sights, restaurants, etc. Our host was very gracious and attentive to details, and we looked forward every day to the sumptuous breakfast we were provided. Though our room was comfy, the bathroom was pretty rough with water seeping up from underneath the tiles and a sink that took forever to drain. We never tried the shower; it was too scary to think about what with the seepage. There was one thing that really turned me off, however. One afternoon, we came back and asked the owner’s daughter if she knew of a good local shop to buy argan oil. She said she wasn’t sure, but…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The room wasn't extremely big, but it was very cozy. Breakfast was always amazing, I could probably say the best I had during all my stay in Morocco. The owner and his son are really nice and extremely helpful. The only thing I did not like was its location. You had to walk quite a lot into the medina in order to reach it. At night, especially after 9 pm, I didn't feel safe at all walking on the narrow, dark streets of the medina. I suppose if you have a man accompanying you, you wouldn't feel scared. However, as women, we didn't feel safe walking all that distance alone at night. Anyway, I suppose this is not a big issue as long as you don't intend coming back so late.

They understand that providing good and honest service is the key to building their reputation, and they do a great job at it. The hotel itself is clean and inviting, the rooms (I stayed in two) are comfortable and well equipped. The breakfast was particularly great.

We sipped mint tea on the rooftop terrace as we watched the moon rise over the medina during the evening call to prayer. The traditional Moroccan breakfast was delicious and more than we could eat!! What we appreciated most was Karim's honesty and willingness to help. He gave us advice on where to eat, how to bargain, where to go to a hamam, and arranged for an official guide from the tourist's office.

Exhausted from our long train ride, we could tell that we were in good hands and eagerly entered to the smell of mint tea. After having some, we quickly retreated to our room for a little down time. The room was very cozy and the decorum contributed to its warm feel.

We drank mint tea on the gorgeous rooftop terrace and slept comfortably in the bedroom suits and there was always someone home in case we needed anything. The breakfast that was prepared for us was the best we had on our trip.

This is a family-run place with owners that truly care about their guests. From day one, they treated us royally, showed us where to go, prepared an incredible breakfast, set us up on tours (not pushy at all), and generally welcomed us and chatted like friends with us. The place is charming and been in the family for generations. (Karim was born in this house actually!) It's clean, homey, and a great place to re-ground after a day of wandering around the winding streets of Fes. I can't say enough great things about Dar Hafsa!!

During our three days here they provided a breakfast that was so large we barely needed to eat the rest of the day, guided us on how to negotiate for good prices around the medina, and introduced us to potential guides (without any pressure, unlike other places we've been to). If you come here, ask them to introduce you to Nadia for a guided tour of Fes - she taught me more in a half-day of walking through the medina than I learned the whole rest of a week in Morocco.

We could not have been in better hands during our quick visit. Aziz met us outside of Bab Boujloud and walked us with our luggage to Dar Hafsa. Karim found us an excellent guide for the day who did an efficient one-day tour of Fez medina focusing on history, trade, and food. Dar Hafsa is tucked away in a safe and quiet area, off of the noisy main drag. The breakfast of fresh baked breads, olives, honey, butter, home made marmalade, and and mint tea is delicious.

The inn itself is absolutely stunning. The high ceilings, terrace and beautiful artwork that decorate the inn make for a surreal experience. Breakfast is from 9 to 11 and is a must as is the terrace. The rooms are very cozy and nicely decorated as well. Mr Idrissi is a very laid back, wonderful person.

The twin room we had was cosy with ensuite bathroom on the top floor. The guesthouse has a roof terrace and a lot of character. The place is inside the old town so have to walk about 5 mins from where the taxi dropped me off. I was impressed with the big breakfast especially with the donuts and the pancakes!

They certainly live up to their reputation on Trip Advisor and will go out of their way to make your stay as good as it can be. We hired a guide for a tour of the medina, which they arranged.

Everyone at Dar Hafsa has gone above and beyond our expectaions. Karim has not only made reccomdations, but has helped us make further travel arrangements, set up cooking lessons, personally brought us to different areas of Medina and negotiated prices for us.

Breakfast is spectacular and there IS coffee - contrary to some reviews - and it IS good. Many languages spoken, all cummunication before and during stay was great. Clean room, good water pressure, hot water. Good place, good people.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2012,5,"Great experience, heartwarming!","I stayed in this Riad with my friend. We did a trip from Marrakesh to Casablanca to Fez. We came by train from Casablanca and a (false) guide tried to convince us that this place was trouble. He told us to book some other place, but luckily we where informed by Dar Hafsa and Lonely planet for the people who work on trains to get commission if you change your booking. Don't believe them! We were picked up at the blue gate to find the hostel and from the minute we walked in we felt very welcome! Room: we had the top floor room witch was great for us. Two separate beds, ensuite bathroom, heating and beautifully decorated. Close to the terrace Breakfast: Great choice of different types of bread, with jam, honey and cheese. The best we had in Morocco. Service: First, we…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2012,5,Lovely place,"If you are looking for a plain, unpersonal riad where you are just another guest then this is not the place to be. If on the contrary you are looking for an accommodation where they take care of you as if you were a member of the family then Riad Dar Hafsa should be your place of choice ! Warm, caring, lovely owners who assist you in any way they can. Having trouble finding that special item to buy, picking out the right restaurant, wondering how to make that yummy tajine ? Sit down and have a cup of mint tea with your hosts and they will tell you. Delicious, lush breakfast; cosy rooms; a sunny roof terrace and the feeling that you have a home in Fes, that is this riad in short. Recommendation: Take a cooking class with the lady next door and find out how to prepare your…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2012,5,Superb. Stop looking and stay here!,"Amazing location, beautiful rooms, terrace and courtyard, and the most friendly and welcoming owners you can imagine. This was the best place we stayed in during our visit to Morocco. We loved that Abdel and his family would sit and chat with us over tea, it really felt like a home away from home in the midst of this chaotic city, and they were always ready to help us with any question we had, even helping us find a fantastic tagine at local prices! This place is truly something special and such good value for the lovely atmosphere and service... And who could forget the incredible breakfast every day! Thankyou Dar Hafsa!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 February 2011,5,Like being in a fairy tale,"Description of the house: a Moroccan home with a cozy atmosphere and a roof-top terrace from which you can see the Medina. What else can you ask for??? However there IS more: the kindness, warmness and hospitality of the family who run this place!!! Words are not enough to describe how this family made us feel. The owner and his daughter and son are really warm people. They advised us, bought some CDs for me (at prices I would have never been able to get!). I was even taught how to prepare mint tea! They looked for a professional and honest tour guide, who showed us the medina. They made sure everything was ok and took care of the smallest details. A VERY caring family indeed!!! A BIG thank you to that lovely family for my experience in Fez! I will never ever forget this…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,4,a nice and homelike hotel,I together with my friends just came back from Morocco and it's a great journey!!!

And this hotel just meets all our requirements and also guys there are really nice.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,Great little hotel..beautiful old clean building in centre of medina..highly recommend this..we lucked out!,"The rooms are spot on, very clean and the showers are top notch, cosy room with great rooftop views.

I really recommend this place to stay in fes, its right in the middle of the old town/Medina too. Mark, Irish.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,Great place to stay in the old medina!,We arrived from Ireland to stay in Fez for one night and ended up staying another. This riad is owned by a very friendly owner and his son and daughter are extremely helpful when it comes to asking directions or finding information. The room was perfect and the interior of the riad is beautifully decorated and it boasts a rooftop terrace you can sit out at. The shower was hot and water pressure really strong! Breakfast was a huge selection of breads and pastries and the coffee was great. A perfect place to explore the old city of Fez with the perfect host. Recommended 100%. Will stay again.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,Home away from home!,"There are not enough good things I can say about Dar Hafsa. This beautiful guest house sits only minutes away from the busy Medina but feels like a world away. From the moment we walked through the door the owner Karim and his family made us feel more than welcomed with their warm and calming demeanor. Throughout our stay the entire family was attentive to our every need. Additionally, when we asked for suggestions as for places to visit and/or shop in the medina the owner himself walked us around ensuring that we did not get lost and paid the best prices. I highly recommend this guest house to anyone visiting Fez. You will not be disappointed!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,Perfect place to stay! Will definitely return.,"This was a terrific choice for our stay in Fez. While it was initially hard to find once we were settled in, the owner and his family made us feel extremely welcome. The entire home is beautiful and the rooms are a good size, clean and very comfortable. The owner was very helpful during our stay and provided clear directions for everything we wanted to visit during our trip. I would definitely recommend waking up for breakfast before you head out for the day and enjoy the tea as well. This was a perfect place to come back to after exploring the somewhat overwhelming Medina. I absolutely recommend this homestay and plan to return here on my next visit to Fez.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,What a nice surprise!,my first time in morocco and i dindnt know what to expect; but dar hafsa was much nicer than i expected from the pictures; the breakfast was with 9 differenty breads and fresh home made pastery; the beds clean and even a heather in the room - morocco is cold this days; and the most important for me: very hot shower; qt the top a nice little terrace with the view of the whole medina.,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,Gorgeous,"We book the accomodation online, and the response was verry quick. The owner provide to us a driver, who pick us up at the airport for a resenable price. The driver took us to the gate of the old city (Medina), where the owner was waiting to us. We just follow him to the raid and we thought to get lost, but is really, really easy to find the riad alone without help. When we've seen the riad, we've were nicely surprised, because is much more beautiful that in the picture. Our room was the smallest, but verry spaceous and comfortable, clean and very warm blankets sat tv, air condition, heater. We had our own bathroom with hot water and very clean!

Breakfast was enormous and very tasty. What a great way to start the day. I would return in a heartbeat.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2011,3,Mixed Feelings,"We stayed at Dar Hafsa for three nights in November and have mixed feelings about the riad. Upon arrival we heard the owner asking another traveller to review the riad on TripAdvisor before they left and also if he could read over it before it was published. Because of this we weren't suprised when he asked us to do the same but we advised that we would do so upon returning home. The positive points are, firstly, we had a good sleep in our quiet room at the top of the stairs and our breakfasts were a filling way to start the day (although if you are looking for fruit or orange juice look elsewhere). It is also in a good location and a close walk to the main street in the medina. The points to improve on are, firstly, we had to ask for toilet paper and towels, I'm not sure why…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,Wonderful homey Riad,"I booked 3 nights with Hafsa and extended one more day. The family (Abdel, Mourem, Aziz all speak near perfect English, and Hafsa who is 13 and learning) is very helpful in giving advices and direction for what to see, how to get there and the local price of what things should cost in general. The place is centrally located inside the Medina but they offer to pick you up at the Blue Gate (Bab Boujloud) when you arrive the first time. It is a beautiful, cozy, and clean Riad. Though they offer to clean my room daily like a hotel, it is good to let them know should you choose to accept as they try not to enter your room for cleaning when you are not here. I had chose to treat it like a home rather than a hotel. When I expressed the liking of good food, Abdel told me that he…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 December 2011,5,Couldn't imagine a more hospitable place,"If you're coming to Fes, or Morocco for that matter, you have to stay here. The owners of Dar Hafsa set up a van to pick 5 friends and me up from the airport upon our arrival, which drove us as far into Fes as the roads would allow. The owner himself--the incredible Abdul Karim, who we all still hope will adopt us one day--then came to guide us through the narrow, labyrinthine streets of the Medina to our building. The location of Dar Hafsa is perfect: it's a short walk (~10 minutes) from excellent restaurants where you can try out some tasty beef tajine with dried prunes, and it's far away from any sort of road, so it's very peaceful at night. On top of that, every morning the family prepares a spectacular breakfast with many types of bread and cakes with cheese, honey,…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2011,5,Friendly riad in great location,"Beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable hostel. Run by a very friendly family who speak excellent English and went out of their way to make us feel at home and make the most of our short stay in Fes - we were picked up from the edge of the Medina, given great advice about what to see, how to get there, where to go shopping and what to pay etc. The breakfast and rooftop terrace are also gorgeous. Great mid-priced option.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 November 2011,5,Fantastic!!,A beautiful place In the middle of the Medina. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean with hot showers. We were made to feel very welcome by the lovely friendly family who were always on hand to help with any questions we had and had lots of suggestions of places to see and visit. We were met at the blue gate when we arrived and given a room to rest in on our last day as as we were getting an overnight train which we were so grateful for. All in all it is a wonderful place to stay and hope to be back one day inshallah :),Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 November 2011,5,A must stay! :-),"Our stay at Dar Hafsa was nothing but perfect. The owner of the Dar and his family were extremely welcoming. After a bad experience at another Riad, we rang Dar Hafsa at 10pm on the off chance that they would have a spare room. Within 5 minutes we were met at the blue gates and were guided back to Dar Hafsa. The Dar itself was beautiful. The room was very clean, comfortable, beautiful decorated and amazing great value. In the morning we were greeted with the most amazing breakfast. We have never had anything quite like it! Through-out our stay, we were constantly thinking about the next breakfast. It was fresh and extremely tasty. The Morocco tea was also incredible. Dar Hafsa is situated in a perfect location. It is located in the middle of the Medina. It is less…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

 October 2011,5,Great hospitality,From the moment of booking to my departure to the airport I was made to feel extremely welcome by the owner and his friendly staff.

 October 2011,5,Wonderful place to stay,"To anyone who is planning a trip to Fès I would highly recommend to stay in Dar Hafsa! I have never before witnessed such a warm welcome in a hostel as given to us by the managing family. The hostel is an original old moroccan home in the center of the medina, absolutely clean and lovely arranged. The roof terrace is an amazing highlight! The familiar atmosphere made us feel very comfortable, also because we where given so many good advices where to go and what to do in the medina. (being three girls we were very grateful for the hospitality!) Being recieved so cordially and cared for so attentively, we spent some wonderful days in Fès and would love to come back one day!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The family who own the Dar-Abdul Karim, his son Aziz and daughter Mariam are extremely friendly and very helpful. Always ready to assist you in any way. Upon arrival, we were provided with mint tea and given valuable advice on what to do and see in Fes. Abdul Karim was fantastic at helping us avoid tourist traps, and organised a day tour to the Mid Atlas region with a lovely guide-at an amazing price! He even escorted us to a fabulous local place to eat( at night) as we were two females on our own. We had a comfortable and clean room with a delicious full breakfast. We found Dar Hafsa to be excellent and will be returning.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

From the moment they picked me up at the Bab Bou Jeloud to the last morning (today!), the hospitality was top notch... and genuine. The rooms were comfortable, the internet was fast, and the showers were hot. Oh, and ask for the top floor and you'll even get a view (peek) of the mountains. Bonus: Karim, Aziz (son) and his daughter all speak English very well. Try finding three English-speaking Moroccans in Fez in the same room any where else... I dare you.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2011,5,Great start to trip..,"My wife and I stayed 3 nights at Dar Hafsa at the start of an 8 day trip through north Morocco. Everything went well from the start when we were met, as arranged, by taxi at the airport. We were then met at the dropping of point by Aziz, Abdel Karim`s son, and taken to Dar Hafsa, which, although tucked away down a side alley, was easy to find. The house is spotlessly clean and beautifully restored and Abdel, his son and Mariam his daughter are always on hand to assist in any way possible. The only suggestions we might make are for more to be made of the delightful roof terrace in the way of furniture ( although I think Abdel may have mentioned that this was in hand ) and that breakfast could include some fruit / egg/ fruit juice. That said, there was always plenty of well…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes

The family are delightfully welcoming and the surroundings homely, done in a traditional Moroccan style. The atmosphere is relaxed, quiet and respectful. The owner, Abdul Karim and his children were always around to help us navigate this sometimes overwhelming city, be it directions, suggestions or taking us to a nice restaurant the night we arrived. Our room was a nice size with its own en-suite shower, stylishly decorated. The price of the room was extremely reasonable and included a filling moroccan breakfast.

Thanks for everything guys!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2011,5,Couldn't be much better,"A friend and I stayed at Dar Hafsa for three nights in September, and were extremely impressed with the guest house (which is beautiful and very clean), and Abdul (the proprietor) and his son who couldn't have been more helpful or welcoming. Obviously there are cheaper places to stay in Fes, but considering Dar hafsa is still very reasonably priced you get far beyond what you pay for. Abdul will also help you arrange any trips, tours or travel you'd like to do, which is very kind, and very useful of him. The breakfasts are delicious, the roof terrace is a good way to relax in some fresh air and the rooms have comfortable beds and air conditioning.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 September 2011,5,Incredible riad and amazing hospitality,"Dar Hafsa is a beautiful, large moroccan home converted into a bnb.

Abdul was ready with helpful suggestions and had a genuine interest in making our experience in Morocco as positive and easy as it could be. We had a wonderful authentic breakfast in the morning and the very more-ish moroccan tea. One can sit on the rooftop and enjoy sweeping views of the old medina at any time of day. There was good wifi and air-con too. The value for money is outstanding and I absolutely recommend staying here.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 August 2011,5,A great choice,"We stayed in Dar Hafsa 2 days and it was a very pleasant stay at all means. Although we have booked an economy double room Abdul Karim, the owner, gave us a very nice bigger triple room without extra cost, also he and his son were very kind and helpful in everything we needed. The place was very nice and clean, it is centrally located so you can go everywhere on foot. Combined with the price I believe it is among the best options in Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 July 2011,5,Lovely friendly Riad in the heart of the Medina,"My friend and I stayed here for 1 night as part of our 12 day Morocco trip, we came from Chefchouen and went the following night on the night train to Marrakesh.

It is a lovely, small, freindly, traditional B&B, decorated beautifully in Moroccan design. The bedroom was clean, cozy, comfortable, free Wi-Fi throughout, added bonus. Lovely rooftop terrace. Excellant location if you want to be in the middle of everything, not far to walk through the whole city- medina, jewish quarter, up to the tombs.

A traditional meal was provided for us each day and we even shared our meal with the owners son.

There was a tv in the room but we never touched it- there was too much else to do! Breakfast was delicious and would definitely keep you going through the day wandering the medina.

There is also a TV in your room but we didn't really use it as there is so much great stuff to see and do in Fes!

A 5/10 minute walk brings you to Dar Hafsa in a quiet street, the peaceful as cool central courtyard provides oasis from the relentless heat and hassle outside. Nothing was too much hassle for Abdul and his family. Mint tea, advice and directions were available at any time. I felt I was staying with good friends.

 May 2011,5,More than just a place to sleep,"We stayed at Dar Hafsa for 3 nights at the end of May and booked it based on all the excellent reviews, which all proved to be true. Dar Hafsa has been beautifully restored and the rooms are nicely decorated and clean, the bed comfortable. The location is just perfect for exploring the medina and being on a side street, it is quiet. Don't miss out on the roof-top terrace, especially at sunset! The breakfast is wonderful, be sure to try everything, and if you want a special, delicious treat, then order a dinner there one night. The best thing about it though is the host, Abdul Karim and his family. Abdul goes way above and beyond and truly makes you feel welcome. He answered every question, organized an excellent tour of the medina one day as well as another day up in the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2011,5,Riad in Fes? Look no further.,"We booked Dar Hafsa because of the great reviews and the wonderful pictures on various website- we were not disappointed. We were blown away by the level of service provided, having no previous experience of Fes and only a limited time there Abdul Karim made sure that we were taken care of. We were given great advice on where to go and what to do, he organised taxis and tour guides and gave us recommendations on where to eat and shop. The breakfast provided was exceptional, traditional and freshly cooked. Seemingly unlimited Mint Tea! The restored Riad was extremely beautiful and authentic, and we were even given advice (and the maximum price we should pay!) on where to buy the silk curtains. This place is a steal for the price we paid and we would highly recommend it to anyone…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2011,5,Everything was great!,"We stayed in Fez at Dar Hafsa for 4 nights in May 2011. This guesthouse was beautifully redone less than a year ago. It is in a great location just off one of the main ways from the Blue Gate, but far enough off to escape the noise and bustle. But the best thing about it is the owner Abdul Karim, along with his family, who was more than helpful with recommendations and planning trips for us. He works very hard to help his guests, and we certainly appreciated it. Dinner at the guesthouse was also outstanding (and affordable at 100Dh/each)!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2011,5,Excellent value for money,"This is a little gem. The owner Abdul and his family are extremely helpful, the daughter Mariam took me to a local hammam and Abdul took my teenage son. What an experience! Abdul can arrange good accomodation in Chef and Merzouga. Dinner is very good and was waiting for us after a 20 hr journey from Canada. Abdul met us at the Blue gate and led us to the riad. Breakfast is tasty too. Riad has a nice terrace, we had the terrace room at the top and enjoyed it very much. Location is quiet, just off the main medina road coming from Bab Beljoud, walking distance to everything. Everything is clean and comfortable. Very much recommended.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2011,5,We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or a friendly more helpful host,"My friend and I stayed at Dar Hafsa during our trip to Fes recently. Our host was so helpful. Not only did he respond to my request for a room quickly but he met us at a central location so that we wouldn't get lost. The traditional home is beautifully done and the rooms are lovely, beds comfortable and we really felt at home. He helped to arrange our tour guide for the day and our desert tour both were things we really wanted to do. The breakfast was amazing and the tea spectacular. I would highly recommend staying here and I would definitely stay here again if I ever found myself in Fes.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 May 2011,5,Simply perfect.,"This was definitely the best stay we had during our two week trip through Morocco! An intimate little Riad down a lovely quiet street that winds off the main thoroughfare of the Medina. We found the area safe and close to everything – just a short stroll up to the restaurants near the main gate or down to the bustling heart of Fez. The rooms were immaculate and thoughtfully decorated (hand painted window shutters, tiled bathrooms, wrought iron furniture, pretty lamps) and all open into a light, airy courtyard. There is a fantastic roof terrace that offers a great view of the city and a nice seating/lounge area in the courtyard to chill out with a book. The breakfasts were fantastic – an array of traditional Moroccan bread, home made and fresh each morning (being woken to the…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2011,5,True Moroccan Hospitality,"My sister found this place online and booked it sight-unseen. It turned out to be fantastic! We loved the beautiful decor, and the hospitality of the owners was wonderful. We had such a great time in Fes and it was largely because of this great place. I was so happy that my sister got such a great impression of Moroccans and Moroccan hospitality right from the start. It set the tone for our entire trip.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2011,5,"Lovely decor, attentive host, excellent stay!","Abdul, the owner, met us and helped with our bags from our taxi, helpful and courteous from the start of our stay to the end. Lovely breakfast, beautiful room, very clean and finished to a high standard (no sloppy grouting on the tiles or random pipes as we found in larger hotel bathrooms!). The whole riad is gorgeous and there was even secure WIFI! We were also recommended an excellent co-op for leather goods (which we took up), a stunning restaurant and taken to a Berber weaving factory.",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 April 2011,5,Briiliant!,"My 16 year old daughter and I stayed in Dar Hafsa and I can't recommend it highly enough. Abdul and his family run the riad, which is beautiful, very clean and very quiet while being right in the medina. They offer loads of advice about Fes and Morocco as a whole and we did trips that we hadn't planned on their recommendation and were never disappointed. We felt in really safe hands and were treated as a member of the family, my daughter can't wait to go back. Thanks guys, and see you soon!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2011,5,Beautiful Riad with super friendly and caring host,I stayed in Dar Hafsa with my friend. We had a lovely time. The rooms are neat and clean. The breakfast was the tastiest we had during our whole Marokko trip. The host is not only very welcoming but will help you out with anything and everything you need. We felt really good in Dar Hafsa and can highly recommend it. Enjoy your trip. Mina,Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2011,5,Dar Hafsa - one of the hidden gems of Fes,"Dar Hafsa was one of the highlights of staying in Fez. Here is a family run riad that gives you a fantastic base from which to plan and enjoy the rest of the journey in Morocco. Mr Abdul Karim, the host, his son Aziz and his daughter Maryam, make an excellent team. If you need to know ANYTHING about your stay in Fez and Morocco, they will be delighted to help. They can guide you on the local cuisine, arranging guides, trips around the country, etc. (They have a special package for visiting Merzouga and the desert in the south). This help was very beneficial for me in terms of shopping in the souks, booking coach tickets and finding places to stay in other towns, and especially tips on how much one should pay. The riad itself is comfortable, clean and without the noise and…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2011,5,The perfect Riad in Fes!,"We stayed at the Riad for 4 nights in March 2011 and we can only recommend it! The family who runs it is more than friendly and made us feel at home from the first moment on. We had nice chats over delicious mint tea and breakfast with them. They helped us with every problem, explained a lot, passed on very useful advice and we could always ask them anything we wanted to know. The house is beautiful and very clean (very very clean!). The rooms and beds are extremely comfortable and so is the cosy sitting room. The Riad is situated right in the centre of the old medina but still in a very quiet street. Best is the peaceful, friendly atmosphere. You can always take a short break from exploring busy Fes and relax in the sitting room. Overall, we loved our stay and if we ever…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 March 2011,5,never seen more hospitality!,"Dar Hafsa is a very nice place to stay when you are in Fez! It is in the middle of the old city and you can do every excursion possible from here! The people are so friendly, they want to fulfill every wish you have and they help you out with any problems you may have! The food is excellent and you can have it at any time you want, they fit theirselves in to your program! Wonderfull experience, definately coming back here!",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
 January 2011,5,What a delightful place - glad to see it on TripAdvisor,"Wonderful reception, wonderful staff (a family) and beautiful house...oh, and a delicious breakfast (try the fluffy shag carpet-looking bread). From the moment we arrived we knew we were in good hands, the airport/train transfers were seamless, the welcome was unhurried and friendly (how many cups of tea must Idrissa drink a day?!?) and the location couldn't be better. We wanted to stay longer in Fes because of our welcome and stay here (and regretted staying so long in Marrakech) and Dar Hafsa's prices are right for as long a stay as possible. One thing to watch out for--I thought the tour guide suggestion the Riad gives when you arrive was a little pushy at first, but IT IS ESSENTIAL. You will not see half as much in Fes without a tour guide, even if you have to be escorted…",Dar_Hafsa-Fes_Fes_Meknes
