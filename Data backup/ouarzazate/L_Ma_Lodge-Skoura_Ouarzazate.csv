 January 2023,5,An oasis inside the oasis!,"Perfect stop for 1 night (or 2 or more!) travelling from Merzouga desert to Marrakech. Top service on accomodation, simpathy and restaurant with good swimming pool for hot days or a cosy fireplace for cold nights!"
 May 2022,5,Our vacation from the vacation,"There were six of us who stayed here and we all LOVED it. It was the perfect oasis after a long day of van travel from Marrakech. The grounds are a rich oasis of palm trees, flowers, a vegetable garden, grass and other greenery which instantly helps you unwind and relax. There are numerous great sitting and lounging areas to enjoy, as well as a few animals who you can feed and visit. We enjoyed lounging and swimming. The two dinners and lunch where delicious and they were able to accommodate my daughter with Celiac Disease. They also very generously made me a delicious birthday cake since I celebrated my birthday during our stay. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed. Book early if you want to stay here as it's small. Vanessa for patient with all our questions. She arranged…"
 December 2022,5,Amazing experience in the Skoura Palmerie.,"This is a fabulous place, a real oasis in every sense of the word. Vanessa is a wonderful host, making sure everyone is welcomed and has the visit they want. The three rooms we used were beautifully decorated, comfortable and warm (it was December) and the food was exemplary. The breakfast was wonderful, with a huge number of homemade preserves and the evening meals we had were really tasty, with the addition of delicious Moroccan wine. The staff were all wonderful without exception. We followed Vanessa's advice to drive up the Dades Gorge, which was stunning and had a short walk in the oasis too. We couldn't fault the whole experience and we're definitely coming back when we can use the gorgeous pool."
 November 2022,5,Wonderful and beautiful,What a simply beautiful place to stay - every detail has been thought about and the result is a beautifully comfortable environment - inside as well as the grounds. We only had one night but would love to come back. We had a wonderful dinner and breakfast. Just great!
 November 2022,4,Retreat atmosphere you must stay longer than 1 short night to take advantage of property,Beware very hard to find especially after sunset. However the property itself is lovely. You really need to spend 2-3 nights to take advantage of what is offered. We arrived late due to difficulty finding property signage is only lit up by your headlights. Had a lovely dinner and then straight to bed. Some issues with electrical outlets- my travel CPAP kept shutting down and you can not have phone and watch plugged in at same time. Lovely gardens to explore when you have more than 12 hours!
 November 2022,5,12 women had an EXCEPTIONAL stay!!,"As the owner of an all female travel event company, where we sleep is always the most important consideration. Vanessa has created one of the most magical and beautifully decorated spaces. We actually had to cancel one of our excursions because no one wanted to leave the resort. Additionally, the service could not be more top notch. They thoughtfully remember who is vegan, gluten free, and all other needs of their guests. Skoura is a precious place ... be sure to engage in the local experiences (i.e. tourist free) that L'ma will arrange for you. I would book this hotel again in a heart beat!!!"
 October 2022,5,A Paradise Guest House,"We knew the minute we arrived that we had chosen the most wonderful accommodation, located in a garden oasis! Upon arrival we received the warmest welcome and our entire 2 days were filled with awe and joy to be in such a very special setting. Vanessa and Xavier are the most delightful “hands on” hosts. Everything from the beautiful immaculate suites, the gorgeous exotic gardens, the heated swimming pool and delicious breakfasts and dinners were absolutely exceptional. It was extremely difficult to leave this special oasis, especially our new friends, Souvane, Abdelrani and Hakim. We highly recommend staying at least 3 nights! Thanks again for a wonderful experience❤️❤️"
 September 2022,5,An oasis in an Oasis….,"Truly a welcoming, friendly, relaxing, and comforting stop after a long day travelling. Arriving late I wasn’t hurried and had time chill in the beautiful pool before dinner in the garden on a balmy evening. In the duplex the spacious downstairs bathroom and dressing room were well appointed and the upstairs bedroom was therefore uncluttered, which, with the good quality bedding, made for a peaceful and comfortable night. Sadly I didn’t have time to linger the following day. This is definitely the place for some downtime while travelling in Morocco!"
 September 2022,5,L’ma Lodge is your home away from home,"We are on 15 days trip in Morocco, stayed for 2 nights in Skoura at L’ma Lodge which turned out to be a total surprise. We have loved every moment of it and are sad to be leaving tomorrow. The place is a real oasis, the staff is most accommodating and welcoming, the food is the best we have had in Morocco so far. The owners have created a real oasis, true paradise. If you plan to be in the area, you have to stay here! We are in owe and forever grateful for the memories."
 July 2022,5,Paradise Found,"Where can you even begin? An absolute garden Oasis. A beautiful seven room boutique hotel in a Palm Grove in the middle of nowhere. We can't even begin to tell you how amazing Vanessa and the entire staff at L'Ma were. The food was over the top, the pool was perfect, and anywhere we decided we wanted to sit, lay, or swinging a hammock was at our disposal. Walking through the beautiful gardens was the perfectly relaxing stay we needed in our journey between Marrakech and the desert. It was like sleeping in an art museum in our own personal Garden of Eden."
 July 2022,5,"Night in L’Ma Lodge, SKOURA, Morocco","Vanessa & Xavier have created an unbelievable place to relax in the middle of nowhere in SKOURA! I, along with my family, spent a night there & felt that it was too short a stay! The hospitality shown by them & their staff was impeccable! The property is absolutely stunning & the decor, including the landscape is something to admire! Apart from creating & maintaining this place, they also rescue non-human lives and take care of their well-being! We would definitely go back there, hopefully in the near future & spend some more time! FIVE STARS ARE AN UNDERSTATEMENT! I wish I could rate them higher! Thank you Vanessa & Xavier for welcoming us & all that you do! Keep up the good work. I will make a conscious effort to come back, with additional family & friends, and spend more…"
 May 2022,5,A wonderful Oasis in Skoura,"We arrived early for a 1 night stay, and were so pleased we did... In the middle of the Palmeraie, the L'Mar lodge has a French Colonial feel, the influence of the owners. Vanessa is friendly and attentive, and the staff were great fun and always helpful. The substantial walled gardens are beautifully laid out with lots of hidden rest areas, lounging on cushions, with a lovely pool. The food was excellent and our room spacious and the A/C worked a treat on a hot day! We'd highly recommend and wush we could have stayed a 2nd night."
 April 2022,5,A touch of Paradise,"From when I spoke to the owner Vanessa on the phone, I knew we’d be taken care of. L’ma Lodge has the understated elegance I was looking for to relax and unwind. They greet you like family the moment you arrive. Their design feels organic providing private spaces for all guests. Lunch on arrival was delicious with fresh ingredients. The massage I had was truly relaxing and healing. Such a magical moment. The rooms are beautiful, unique, clean and quiet. The pool area was beautiful with all the facilities you could want. Even unique wide brimmed hats to shade your head. I would recommend staying here 100%. If I return to Morocco, I will definitely stay here again. Thank you Vanessa, Xavier and all the L’ma Lodge family. x"
 April 2022,5,We LOVE L’Ma Lodge!,"We had the best experience at this Lodge. The staff, rooms, food, ambiance were all first rate. As it was my birthday the day we were there, they went above and beyond in helping us celebrate with a beautiful cake and a gift of lovely earrings. We wished we had stayed several nights !. We highly recommend."
 March 2022,5,Enchanting!,Great place tucked in the heart of a palm grove. Tastefully done. The staff was very kind and courteous. We stayed with them just for a night on our way to Merzouga but had a fabulous time in this slice of paradise. It is one of those places that allows you to unplug and truly unwind. Highly recommended.
 February 2022,5,"Beautiful lodge, kind staff","My husband and I stayed at L'Ma Lodge for four nights last month. Our hosts there arranged a wonderful drive from Marrakesh, which turned into a fantastic sightseeing trip all on its own. At the lodge itself, Sufjian took such good care of us! He arranged two tours for us, and when it was time to leave, he personally put us on a bus and then called us to make sure we arrived safely. The property is lovely, the food was very good, and the rest of the staff, including Abdi, were all great and made us feel like family."
 October 2021,5,Absolutely enchanting place in a fairytale oasis environment,"The lodge is set amidst a beautiful palm grove and manicured garden. The rooms are comfortable and pleasant, and the hosts are very friendly and helpful. Dinner was excellent - by far the best couscous we had during our 20 day stay in Morocco."
 November 2021,5,"Must visited place in Skoura, Morocco","I have been to many resorts around the world & I can definitely say that this place is more than just a resort. It’s a huge hug & a kind of family for the visitors, located in Skoura. Skoura is an incredible palm trees village in Morocco. You have to visit it either during your stay in Ouarzazate or on your way towards the desert. L’ma Lodge thank you so much for your great hospitality! The resort is excellent in everything! Every corner of the resort is a little gem! So many different spots to enjoy, amazing decoration, cleanliness, service, food! All was a unique experience which is value for money for sure! If you travel to Morocco, I strongly recommend spending a bit of your time visiting Skoura & L’ma Lodge. Regards, Elena"
 November 2021,5,Beautiful riad with attentive staff and great food,"Sadly, I only spent one night at L'ma Lodge! It is a beautiful property with very attentive staff. My only small complaint is the lack of wifi in the rooms, which forces you to go to the shared spaces to send an email, etc. Aside from this, it could not have been a better stay."
 November 2021,5,Beautiful Oasis in Skoura!!,"We just had a wonderful stay at L’Ma Lodge in Skoura. We had booked this trip for March 2020, but COVID intervened and we ended up going 18 months later. We had read the reviews, but did not know if the lodge would still be as attractive as before the pandemic. When we drove down a long, dirt road, we started to wonder if we had made the right choice. We got to the front door, and the lodge is marked only by a small sign. Initially nobody answered the door…but eventually we were greeted by the friendliest gentleman who welcomed us and immediately introduced us to Vanessa who built the lodge with her husband. The grounds are magnificent! Words cannot describe how they transformed this patch of land into a true oasis. There are fruit trees or every variety, gardens with…"
 November 2021,5,Amazing stay at L'Ma Lodge,"We stayed two nights in M’la Lodge in Nov-21. We highly recommend the place to anyone willing to discover the peaceful feeling of staying in the middle palmeraie in a green and delicate environment. The rooms are super comfortable and tastefully furnished, the food is great, the people are super nice. This place would suit a couple wanting to spend some romantic days, a group of friends but also a family (as there are some very nice playgrounds for kids. Soufiane and Vanessa would be more than happy to advise you on what to do in the region, notably the biking tour of the palmeraie with Hassan (best way to discover it from the inside)! Mathilde & Alexi"
 October 2021,5,Most beautiful place I’ve ever seen!!!,"The people here are the most wonderful people I have ever encountered!!! They will go above and beyond to meet your needs. It is literally like staying in a different world! The garden is beautiful, and the house is so meticulously decorated! If you haven’t planned a visit to Skoura, make an exception just to come to this place!!!"
 September 2021,5,A true gem,"L'ma is really a special place not to miss if you are doing the desert. We initially planned for a short 2nights stay and extended to 4nights. We could have easily done more. From the welcome, the grounds, room, food to the cats everything was so perfect. Special thanks to Soufiane who was so kind and is very knowledgeable of the region. He gave some great tips which is great if you want to explore things off the beaten path. Overall a very special place with an amazing team!"
 August 2021,5,Fabulous! We enjoyed every minute of our stay,"You can feel the love Vanessa, Xavier and the whole team have put in every corner of the lodge and the gardens. Very clean and elegant decoration, and very loyal to the the theme of that region of Morocco. Super nice and attentive staff without being overwhelming, you feel welcomed and part the family as soon as you cross the door. I also liked the strong connection the staff have with the owners, what a wonderful team. I highly recommend L'Ma Lodge."
 August 2021,5,"Amazing, come as a guest, leave with an extended family.","This place was AMAZING! Not only is it gorgeous with many wonderful places to sit and enjoy the gardens and pool, but the staff was excellent and really made the place feel like home and an extended family. Everyone who works there is so kind and knowledgeable about the region. The massages we got were wonderful and very professional. I would come back here in a second - feels like family !"
 July 2021,5,The best place we’ve ever stayed,"Beautiful, gracious, delicious. Attentive staff, fresh Moroccan food, lovely rooms, refreshing gardens and pool. Incredibly relaxing in a stunning setting, Vanessa and the entire team were welcoming and helpful. Hope to return one day!"
 May 2021,5,Great place in the nature,Located in remote area with great landscape and interesting way to reach the lodge but with efficient signage. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. The facility is very well done and offering a very relaxing environment. Beautiful place for couples or families.
 April 2021,5,a wonderful place!,"Vanessa and her family created an incredible place of peace and beauty! The small hotel (7 rooms in total) inmidst 4000+ plants planted by themselves is a very special spot. The food was great, the service charming and very attentive. We are very much looking forward to hopefully coming back soon!"
 April 2021,5,Two night stay in M’La lodge,"M’La lodge was an exceptionally special place, where we felt part of a family for the two days we spent there. The passion and detail infused from the Vanessa and Xavier in setting up the property was evident everywhere. We dined in their beautiful property with the other guests and could retreat to the hundreds of carefully crafted spots around the property to enjoy some peace and quiet among the hundreds of plants, animals and serenity. Doubtlessly one of the most special places in Morocco and one I will for sure return to, and recommend among friends"
 April 2021,5,Amazing Relaxing Lodge in Morocco!,Visited L’Ma in April via a tour traveling from Merzouga and were so surprised how excellent the lodge/hotel is. It is located deep within the city outline (small roads to arrive) and upon arrival we felt we just arrived in paradise. The lodge owner greeted us and we felt like king and queen and just so special immediately. The lodge is small (I believe only 7 rooms) but this helps hold the unique charm and relaxation environment with many locations within the resort to just “chill” and enjoy the grounds and nature. Great views of the Atlas snow capped mountains on upper relaxation area of rooftop. The rooms are extremely elegant and new with so much attention to every detail (never seen this perfect extreme detail in any other lodge room!)The food is just excellent and along…
 March 2020,5,Vaca!,Amazing hotel! It was a wonderful experience after a long drive! Close to sights.Gorgeous rooms and relaxing environment. The owner made us feel welcome in their home! Would definitely would love to come back!
 February 2020,5,Beautiful and relaxing oasis,"I visited L'Ma for with a group of friends on a tour and was blown away by how beautiful and tranquil it is! It was the perfect spot to relax by the pool, the rooms were gorgeous and comfortable and the food was incredible. So many wonderful little chill out lounges and cozy nooks with lovely local textiles. I would love to come back again but stay for a whole week :)"
 January 2020,5,Fantastic House Hidden Away in The Palmeraie at Skoura,We cycled across the Atlas Mountains and found L'Ma Lodge a perfect destination for two weary cyclists. Shortly after arriving we were given cold beers enjoyed a fabulous evening meal in the beautifully restored house. The staff were very helpful and accomodating.
 June 2019,5,Oasis for travelers with family,"Beautiful property, tranquil, amazing gardens and artful rooms. Family style dining for guests in nicely appointed area. Food has home cooked feel, but chef style taste. We were greeted by the owner and given the history of her property. A quick stroll through native gardens took us to our room where we had a Moroccan style staircase leading up to our suite. We talked to several guests, mostly Europeans, and several book this property more than once. Huge play area (and trampoline!) for children."
 December 2019,5,New Years Eve,"We, a 3 generation family group, spent NYE at L'Ma. What a stunning place it is. The rooms are chic and so comfortable. The roof top terrace and gardens are delightful. We had so many courses for dinner, I lost count. We sat near a lovely log fire and were entertained by 3 talented musicians. The new year was brought in outside in the garden with fire dancers. Like other reviewers have said - we wished we could spend longer there."
 November 2019,5,Sublime,"This hotel was the absolute highlight of our trip to Morocco. It is French countryside meets kasbah chic. The walled gardens are immaculately maintained. Our room was comfortable, luxurious and stylish. We ate all meals here and the food was fresh and well prepared. We had the good fortune to meet owners Vanessa and Xavier, who were absolutely charming. Through them we arranged a bike tour of the Skoura oasis which was great value and amazing. My only regret is only having stayed for one night. In retrospect, I wish we had stayed here during our entire holiday and just done day trips. We will be back!"
 November 2019,5,Totally Charming!,"Our stay at L'Ma Lodge in Skoura was absolutely delightful. Sandwiched within 3 weeks of busy travel throughout Morocco, it provided a welcome place of quiet relaxation for weary travelers. The staff was attentive and the food was tasty. Breakfast was beyond delicious! The gardens were simply delightful, filled with lovely shaded areas to relax around the pool and under trees laden with olives and pomegranates, with resident cats, a virtual aviary of birdsong. Our only wish was that we had been there when the weather would have allowed us to enjoy the grounds a bit more fully. More reason to grab a few friends and go back again!"
 December 2019,5,"Excellent place, excellent team, excellent food.","We booked L’Ma Lodge a day before it closed for the season - so we very luckily had the entire place to ourselves! We were welcomed by the friendly and ever so helpful Soufiane. The rooms were fantastic, the entire place was stunning and felt so dreamy with its areas of relaxation. I wish we met Vanessa & Xavier but they were away on family hols! The team at l’ma lodge took care of us so so well- the chef prepared the BEST MEAL and was so genuine in wanting to provide a meal we loved (which we most definitely did). Breakfast was equally great, with more jams than I’ve ever seen and traditional Moroccan pancakes! My only regret is staying one night - I now understand why the other reviews say the same thing. I wish I stayed longer to experience it more than I did! It was…"
 October 2019,5,Sensational place ...far exceeds!,"This place was a welcome surprise that far exceeded expectations. I only wish we had more time there. Beautiful decor, stunning grounds, incredible vibe and feel, lovely owners, I cannot say enough good things. Incredible foods......don't hesitate. You will not be disappointed!"
 November 2019,5,An oasis of a place in the middle of an oasis,"This place is just great. The owner is top notch. The service is very very good. The food is great, We were so amazed at everything. The room, the atmosphere. We were so pleased with everything, There is even a heated pool. Very quiet indeed."
 October 2019,5,Paradise,"Upscale lodge with a lush (unbelievable!) garden and excellent accomodation. It's expensive (especially food is pricy), but it's well worth it which is why we still give this a 5 star rating. Everything is of the highest quality, service is truly outstanding. We took the 1/2 day tuktuk tour with guide Abdel, which we can highly recommend."
 October 2019,5,Really good place,We arrived very tired and hot from a long drive and day in the desert near Merzouga. We were graciously greeted and treated to very comfortable accommodations and excellent food. Vanessa and her team have done a great job creating a wonderful place to stay. 5 stars all around.
 October 2019,5,Unforgettable,"An unforgettable place well hidden in the oasis of Skoura. Extremely friendly staff and host. The swimming pool, garden with a lot of little cosy created sitting places are just perfect. The room is decorated with beautiful materials and with a lot of care. We even had a private shower outside. The breakfast and optional dinner are very tasty, especially because almost everything is homegrown in their gardens!"
 September 2019,5,Absolutely Magical,"My husband and I just returned from a two week tour through Morocco. The agency that we used booked our accommodations. We stayed in several different places over the course of the two weeks - but L'Ma Lodge was a completely different experience. It wasn't in a large city so, we weren't sure what the rooms or meals would be like. Let me tell you that staying here was magical. The energy of the place was so serene and the owner, Vanessa, was as graceful as the lodge she has created. Strolling past the pomegranate trees and palms on the way to our room, showering in a private outdoor shower and enjoying a delicious dinner and breakfast were fantastic."
 September 2019,5,A beautiful Oasis,"What a delight to stay at L’Ma lodge after a couple of days travelling to and from the Sahara. We were welcomed by the staff & on arrival the owner gave us a personal tour of her home, the grounds full of vegetables, fruit trees, rescue animal zoo & swimming pool. Our room was in the Riad with views of trees from our room on the top floor so calm & quiet. The evening meal was Moroccan with local musicians playing & dancing. Thankyou to all the staff, L’Ma lodge is a home away from home. Wish we could have stayed more than one night. Lisa & John - Australia"
 August 2019,5,An oasis of relaxation,"If you’ve booked only one night, you’ll regret not booking another. L’Ma Lodge is a charming and elegant bo-ho paradise property nestled in the middle of an oasis in the small town of Skoura. The staff are excellent. The rooms are clean. The views of the sunset are stunning. The property layout is well organized and includes areas for relaxing poolside, naps in hammocks, and comfortable seating areas for reading a book or having lunch. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive and knowledgeable. The food is excellent. This hotel is perfect for couples and small families. From outside Marrakech to Fes, and the towns in between, it’s unlikely you’ll find a better hotel. Horseback rides through the palm grove are available at a nearby stable."
 August 2019,5,"A home away from home, tucked in a palm grove","After the short jaunt on the dirt road to the hotel, we were unsure of what to expect. But the incredibly warm welcome from the staff had us swept off our feet immediately. Soo grateful we altered our travel plans from one night to two. This hotel is a home away from home. By our second evening we stayed up late into the night have an interesting and informative chat with the Manager about Morocco and it’s culture. All staff were kind and attentive. After seeing my love of cats they brought us to where a new batch of kittens had been born in the morning. Not to mention the hotel itself. The owners have done a wonderful job and created all kinds of romantic and communal alcoves all over the property. They have very talented cooks, and the food was the best we had in…"
 June 2019,5,Must-Stay between Marrakesh and the Sahara!,"L'Ma Lodge, although not as luxe as some of our other Morocco accommodations, was by far our favorite! Vanessa and her family have created a true oasis in the middle of what honestly felt like the middle of nowhere (don't be alarmed by the rustic surroundings and dirt roads!). Our room was charming and the property was filled with delightful touches, including countless, intimate seating areas. We loved playing bocce ball and badminton, and the heated pool was just perfect. The rooftop was ideal for star watching--honestly, we it was prettier than in the Sahara! The restaurant was among the best of our trip, with much of the food coming straight from the garden. I'm still dreaming of the goat cheese salad from dinner and the 10+ jam options at breakfast!! Our only…"
 June 2019,5,"Magical Stay, Incredible Staff!","Wow! If you will be in the area, or happen to be taking the drive from Marrakesh to the Sahara, you MUST stay at L'ma Lodge. Even if you are not planning to be in the area, it is worth the drive! L'ma Lodge is truly something special. My wife and I were in Morocco for part of our Honeymoon and were taking the drive from Marrakesh to Merzouga and decided to stay at L'ma Lodge as a half way point as it had been recommended to us by a friend. Our only mistake was not staying for at least 2 nights! We arrived at night after a long drive and were beyond exhausted and hungry. Stepping inside the door to this magical retreat, we could not have received a warmer welcome. The staff had arranged for us a late night dinner as we were arriving later in the evening due to our travel plans.…"
 June 2019,5,Beautiful Oasis,"After a wonderful desert experience and a long drive, the L’ma Lodge provided a most welcome respite from the barren landscape. The owners have created a lovely tree filled oasis where shade and foliage were abundant. The indoor spaces were simply and elegantly designed to create a soft and calming spot to relax. We also enjoyed a sumptuous dinner under the stars and the breakfast was fabulous with the largest assortment of homemade jams I’ve ever seen. I could easily see why so many choose to stay much longer."
 June 2019,5,Relaxing oasis,"After driving through desert landscapes we literally arrived in an oasis. Walking through the gates of L’Ma we instantly knew it was really nice. Between the open air arrival area, thick lush grass, tropical plants, trees and refreshing welcome tea it was like walking into a relaxing oasis. Our room was bright with screened windows to enjoy the breeze at night, air conditioner (not needed), great shower pressure and very comfortable bed. We especially loved the pool and pool area. We spent most of our days at the pool just relaxing on the comfortable beds enjoying being surrounded by a lush garden. We had lunch and dinners here. This was some of the best food we’ve had. Everything was fresh from the garden to table. The dinners were incredible and different each of the 4…"
 May 2019,5,A beautiful hotel and property,"We loved this place! It was a long day of driving in torrential rain. We were greeted so warmly by the staff and ushered to our lovely rooms to rest before dinner. The dinner we had was one of the best of our trip to Morocco - a lovely salad with goat cheese and the best chicken tagine of the whole trip. The hotel is beautifully appointed - a mix of traditional and modern. The gardens are lovely - so many wonderful little spots to sit and enjoy a book, a coffee, or a glass of wine. Our only regret is that we only had one night. I would definitely suggest spending 2 or 3 days at this lovely oasis."
 May 2019,5,A Truly Special Lodge,"We stopped here for one night on our way to the Sahara. It was incredibly peaceful; there was only one other couple staying at the lodge that night. Rooms are in a building separate from the main lodge building and are well-appointed and very comfortable. The bathroom light fixture was beautiful! The gardens are lush with a lot of spots to sit and contemplate what a special place you are experiencing. Dinner was outside on the terrace, with flickering candles and delicious food. The buffet breakfast had many options. Finally, the staff were very hospitable and welcoming. I highly recommend L'Ma Lodge."
 June 2019,5,A perfect stay,"This lodge is like a dream. Enchanting gardens, beautiful stylish rooms, friendly, kind staff and delicious food. The owners have created a paradise in Skoura, I’d recommend a couple of nights as a stopover on your way to or from the desert. One of the best places I’ve ever stayed. I’d love to return."
 May 2019,5,"Unexpected elegance, tucked away.","After a long driving day from the desert, the last part of which was in heavy rain, we arrived at L’ma to perfection with a warm welcome from the staff. The owners have masterfully blended traditional handmade Moroccan crafts with a European aesthetic. Commodious, elegant, welcoming, and comfortable. In the garden there are endless charming sitting areas, some with tables and chairs and others with colourful scattered throw rugs and pillows under dappled light. We were enchanted. The rooms, continuing the Moroccan/European aesthetic are calm and elegant. The dinner was outstanding, from the excellent salad with goat cheese and fresh lettuces, to the tagine of chicken figs and almonds. Expertly done, a perfect balance of the savoury chicken, sweetness of the figs and crunch…"
 May 2019,5,What a precious gem this lodge is!,"We have spent two days here relaxing before returning to Marrakesh airport. These were two fabulous days that have put the ‘cherry’ on top of an already great Maroccan roundtrip. Coming from the N10 you easily need to follow the signs some 6 kms. You may be surprised initially driving through a group of berber buildings first, but the real surprise will be when you enter the oasis of the ‘palmerie’ palmtree yard of l’Ma. The gardens are beautiful, huge and very well managed. The clean rooms are spacious and stylish decorated in a kind of modern tribal Maroccan way. The main building could be a setting for a design magazine. But their absolute treasure is their kitchen. All diners and breakfast have been by far the best we had on our Maroccan roundtrip. Having a Wallonian/French…"
 May 2019,5,A welcome surprise!,"My wife and I are from California and we happened to spend one night at L’ma Lodge as we were enroute to Marrakech from the Sahara. Upon arriving the staff was very welcoming and pleasant. Vanessa, the owner of the lodge was superbly kind and gave us a brief tour of the place. She told us about how environmentally friendly the company is, and how they rescued some stray animals as well. The place itself seemed refreshing in comparison to other places we’ve stayed. It felt like a luxurious home away from home. The amenities included bocci ball court, swimming pool, multiple lounge and hammock areas. My only regret is that we only spent one night."
 May 2019,5,Perfect Stopover,"After a long drive from Erfoud, we spent one night in this small boutique-type hotel in the middle of a large oasis. Perfect stopover. Beautifully created and furnished with obvious great love, style and attention. There is a large garden with a delightful swimming pool and a number of restful sitting areas. As we arrived, we were taken into the kitchen to meet the cook and to discuss the dinner menu. The staff all delightful with a real sense of humour. Dinner was excellent - as was breakfast the next day. We left fully rested - and rejuvenated. Highly recommended."
 May 2019,5,Restful haven.,"After a long drive from the desert L’Ma was a wonderful oasis in the oasis. Beautifully appointed rooms, lovely staff and wonderful meals. The pool, roof top and various sitting areas where perfect. We left feeling revived and wishing we could stay longer."
 April 2019,5,Lovely Oasis,"This place is truly an oasis with beautiful grounds, heated pool, rooftop terrace, excellent and caring staff, good food, beautiful rooms. We came with Small Footprint Travel after a few days desert camping and the Lodge was just a wonderful spot to relax and enjoy. It is a great place to stay and a great way to break up the drive from the large cities to the desert."
 April 2019,5,Hidden gem in an oasis,My husband and I spent two lovely days under the care of Vanessa and her fantastic team at L'Ma Lodge. Her attention to detail and care taken towards all who stayed in her home was impeccable and we cannot recommend them more highly. You will not regret spending some time in this beautiful oasis within an oasis.
 March 2019,5,Wish we could stay longer!,"This was as amazing property and our favorite stay throughout Morocco. I just wish there was more to do in the area so that we could stay longer. It was a perfect spot for relaxing in the oasis. We had a large, 2 room suite with a separate living area on the lower floor. We spent most of our time relaxing under the trees and on the rooftop in some of the many outdoor seating areas. Vanessa made us feel so welcome and at home. L'Ma Lodge reminds me so much of some of the nicer agriturismos in Italy. It is certainly perfect for families, with playgrounds, a pool, badminton, and even a bocce court. The food was also excellent, some of the best we had in Morocco. And everything was fresh from the garden and weekly market."
 March 2019,5,Loved. Really special!,"Absolutely charming and lovely. We arrived late in the day after a long drive from Marrakech. We were greeted by Charlie and Milo, (the owner) Vanessa’s children, along with sweet Brahim. Such a warm welcome. We all knew this was going to be special. After a short tour of the property with Vanessa, we were shown our rooms. Very comfortable, charming and cozy with modern amenities. A complete antithesis to our stay at The Four Seasons in Marrakech, but we all loved L’Ma Lodge in so many other ways. The main house serves as a meeting place for everyone. Different nooks to choose from to to sit and relax, much like the property itself (the grounds are wonderful). Cocktails and wine were available, and it was so nice to just sit back and do nothing. When we were ready to eat…"
 March 2019,5,Beyond 5 Stars!,"This gem is absolutely beyond 5 stars! We travel around the world and L'Ma was one of our top three places ever! Vanessa and Javier have truly created a unique, creative, relaxing and special place. We arrived late and our only regret is not staying longer. The rooms and main house are perfectly curated with lovely art pieces, textiles, all in their proper places. The staff was extremely help and kind. Then there is the rescued animals, the healthy cats, the organic garden, the pool space, bocce ball, and the grounds. Going to sleep in the comfy beds to the sound of crickets was a dream. Every detail was well visioned and it shows. You must stay here - you won't regret it!"
 March 2019,5,Perfect retreat!!!,"This place is a true oasis!!! If you really want a calm and peaceful place to rest, disconnect, and take some time to slow down and admire the beauty of nature this place is absolute PERFECTION. It is so impeccably and tastefully decorated. The attention to detail is evident in every step you take. From the moment we walked in we felt so comfortable and welcome, our room was spacious, gorgeous and luxurious. There are so many spots to sit and relax in the hotel, including tents, hammocks, pool area and rooftop areas for stargazing. The delicate lighting at night made everything look so warm and romantic. OMG and did I mention my absolute favorite!!! The little animal stable in the back with a rescue horse, donkeys and goats!!!The man in the blue shirt (dont know his…"
 February 2019,5,The nicest place we stayed in Morocco,"This place really has it all. Comfortable rooms. Excellent food. Excellent, friendly, helpful staff. Beautiful grounds that are clean and pleasant. My son and I enjoyed the petanque surface! Lots of places to hang out on cushions or hammocks under the palms. Definitely plan to stay an extra day and take advantage of just being in L'ma Lodge. We rented bikes and spent one day biking around the oasis using a hand-drawn map from one of the staff at the Lodge. Everything was perfect. Thank you so much!"
 February 2019,5,paradise in the oasis,This place is a wonderful paradise. A wonderful garden in the heart of the oasis. The rooms are big and magnificent decorated. Breakfast and dinner are excellent. We had homemade jam from fruits from the garden they tasted excellent. SOUFIANE and his staff did everything to let us feel like home. I strongly recommend this place for a wonderful and relaxing stay.
 February 2019,5,A true oasis,"This spot is a true mini desert oasis. The family who owns and runs the place have created a lovely spot with gardens, beach ball, bocce ball, a kids playground and lots of little places to sit under the palm trees. There is also a pool. Only seven rooms which assure a sense of privacy. The dinner we had there was one of the best we have had in morroco."
 February 2019,5,A wonderful visit!,"After a long day and drive enjoying stunning scenery and visiting Kasbahs,we were happy to arrive at the L’ma Lodge. The staff welcomed us with smiles and humor; truly hospitable and warm making us feel at home. The property is beautiful and our “up-graded” suite perfect for my daughter and myself. We couldn’t have been more comfortable; the bathroom, immaculate, has great products and shower. The Moroccan design of the hotel incorporates African elements; all around the property are secret lounging areas tucked in among the trees as well as a beautiful roof-top with more seating to view the sunset! Although the weather was too cold to swim, the pool looks beautiful. We should mention that there is a bocce court and area for children to sit and play as well as rescued animals to…"
 January 2019,5,One of the nicest places I've stayed!,"Oh my goodness--this is truly a special place. I would love to go back and stay for days. We were there for only a night, but I'd love to go back and stay when it's warmer and we could take advantage of the grounds and the pool. Our room was exceptional (it was actually a family room that really is--separate areas for two twins and another for a queen, and then a sitting area). The entire place is beautifully decorated. The staff is amazing, warm, and happy. And we had the best meal of entire trip here. It's a bit off the beaten track but I really do hope to go back someday."
 January 2019,5,Highlight of our trip,"We went on a little adventure across the moroccan and l'ma lodge was the hardest place to leave. We wished we'd stayed a week. The garden is exceptional, the room was beautiful and clearly attention was paid to every detail when building the place. And the food was the best of our trip. A little piece of heaven..."
 December 2018,5,Morocco Trip 2018,"A truly amazing place to stay with amazing people running it. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived and the service was consistently fantastic. The rooms were clean, warm, and overall afforded us a wonderful stay after traveling for 10 straight days. I would strongly recommend to anyone staying in Skoura - this has to be the best hotel in the area by far."
 January 2019,5,Amazing!!! Friendly!! A dream!!,We visited L’ma lodge for the day and had lunch as it was fully booked. I travel alone with 2 children and could not get a better welcome. This is a place to go to and forget about the outside world and feel very safe in the service minded hands of all the people working there. It is amazing what the family who runs the hotel have accomplished. The garden seems neverending and everywhere there are comfy cushions to sit on under lanterns carefully placed all around... it is a mini paradise... and this due to the passion and warmth of the people who run/ and work there. Thank you for an amazing day! Oh yes! The lunch was delicious! Animals are installed on the paradise as are games for both kids and grownups... Ill come back as soon as possible and hope to stay in this hotel ;)
 December 2018,5,Did not want to leave!,"Although we stayed only one night, Soufian made sure we had a comprehensive stay. We had 3 perfectly prepared meals and he suggested we rent bikes. He had the bikes delivered to our hotel and made us a map. This lodge is artistically and carefully decorated. Every angle is a pleasure to the eyes. Next time I will stay a week. En Shallah. Shoukran, Soufian."
 December 2018,5,Unparalleled personalized service,"We spent 2 nights in L’Ma lodge in early December. The entire experience was wonderful: beautiful location, great rooms with nice rooftop terrace with gorgeous views of the palm grove and mountains, good food and best of all the friendliest staff. I celebrated a birthday and had an unforgettable night with a chocolate cake and a birthday song in Berber, Arabic, French and English! Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!"
 December 2018,5,A hidden treasure,We visited L'Ma Lodge for a one night stay on an Authentic Morocco tour but wished it was longer. Our hosts have realised an amazing dream - 5 star accommodation and facilities in a beautiful and tranquil setting. Truly spectacular!
 December 2018,5,"Oasis at the end of a narrow, dirt road","After almost 7 days of non-stop touring around the Kingdom...including a Berber tent camp in the Sahara, we were absolutely giddy with excitement when we pulled up to the wooden entrance door to L'Ma Lodge. The owners have really created an oasis. Everything is understated luxury and very comfortable. I had a suite that was very large (could have slept at least 6 people!). All the creature comforts were covered. The bed, pillows and sheets felt comforting, and I slept like a baby! Dinner was outstanding. Breakfast was wonderful. The Chef had prepared at least 15 different jams for our sampling. Don't miss the fresh pomegranite juice - it's delicious. Visited in December, so the pool was closed but I could just imagine being there in the spring with all the plants blooming,…"
 November 2018,5,Paradise!,"What a gem! We stayed one night in this beautiful lodge and can’t wait to come back and spend weeks! It’s so beautiful and the owners have created something truly magical in this oasis. From the garden to the rescue animals and every detail in between, this property has it all! It truly felt like paradise in the middle of the desert. The food is a shining piece of the experience. We had an amazing dinner prepared by the chef, and it was definitely of Michelin quality. Our breakfast was incredible! They put out more than 10 types of jams and spreads, all made in-house from the fruits and vegetables they grow in the garden. The service was incredible and you can tell everyone who works there really loves their job. That’s the best type of place to stay and you can feel the…"
 November 2018,5,delightful,"We had a wonderful, but too short stay at L'Ma Lodge. Extremely beautiful grounds, and exquisite taste. Very friendly. Great food. Very affordable. They have worked so hard make this place special and it is. Don't miss it!!!"
 October 2018,5,Beautiful oasis in the desert,"I was a little nervous as we went down the dirt road to get to the lodge, but as we arrived and walked into the compound I was out done! This place is gorgeous and possibly the most beautiful place that we stayed at during our travels to morocco. The owners were extremely nice and helpful, the staff was warm and made you feel like you were at home. The grounds are beautiful and all of the food there is grown organically. The rooms are spacious, the beds are nice and plush, it was clean and had a nice warm shower. I love everything about it and could have stayed there for a week. I definitely recommend this place to anyone that is traveling in this area."
 September 2018,5,Amazing place to stay,My partner and I stayed at L’Ma a few months ago. It was amazing. I don’t normally write reviews but I felt that L’Ma was so exceptional that I needed to write one. The owners were lovely and very welcoming. The staff were also excellent and seemed to be happy working at L’Ma which was great to see. Nothing was too much trouble and the owner gave us a tour of the property when we arrived. I think the owner mentioned that she had worked for Club Med previously. You could tell - everything was spot on. The rooms were beautiful. Even the toiletries were really lovely and the outdoor areas were paradise. My biggest regret was that we weren’t staying longer. They had more places to sit and relax than anyone could ever actually use. Lots of lovely hammocks under fruit trees to…
 October 2018,5,Utterly Charming!,"What an absolute gem of a place this is. The attention to detail the owners have put in made this place really special. It was a long drive from Marrakech but it was 100% worth it, nestling in an Oasis within the beautiful landscape of this part of the Atlas Mountains, the owners have obviously put their hearts and souls into creating such a charming place to stay. The owner even made her own tiles! They organised 2 camels for us to ride on with 2 children on each camel and then we each jumped up as well for part of the jaunt. This was a great way to discover the essence of the Berber village. The rooms are beautiful and we had an outside shower (as well as the indoor one!) and the gardens are really well designed with cool seating areas, a mini volleyball pitch, a small…"
 March 2018,5,Lovely place!,"When entering the lodge it was a big “wow” feeling. The decorations are so beautiful – Moroccan style with a modern touch. Vanessa welcomed us and we had a lovely evening with a great meal next to the fireplace. In the morning we had a stroll in the beautiful garden before having a delicious breakfast buffet with plenty of homemade jams, yoghurt, bread, pancakes and more! Before leaving we had a nice tour explaining the system of the palm grove. Don’t miss out on this place!"
 October 2018,5,An OMG lodge,"What a beautiful place in the middle of nowhere and on the way to Merzouga. The owners are form Belgium and France and and have been in Morocco 20 plus years. They have done wonders with this property in terms of gardens, animal rescue, food, staff, buildings. Wish we could have stayed longer. The restaurant, by the way, was terrific for breakfast and dinner."
 October 2018,5,"A lovely oasis in Southern Morocco - authentic yet refined - ""just do it""","Most travelers stay in nearby (well 45-min to 1 hour away is nearby) Ouarzazate in the usual Berber Palace. I did my usual diligence to find a handful of alternatives and we are really glad to have taken the last room (months in advance) at L'Ma Lodge (means ""water"" in Arabic). What a delight (once you find it - use google maps)! Madame (Vanessa) runs a tight ship and effortlessly ensures that all is how it should be. The gents working the kitchen and handling bags, etc., cannot do enough-- damn they work hard. Vanessa has attention to detail-- good shower, thankfully (both an indoor shower and an outdoor shower like on safari). I would have preferred a softer mattress but that is my only suggestion with regard to the room. THERE IS A LOVELY HEATED POOL-- this is…"
 October 2018,5,Beautiful and relaxing,"Our family of 5 spent one night at L’Ma Lodge. The hosts were extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful and took obvious (and well deserved) pride in their lodge. The grounds were amazing with many cozy places to sit, relax and enjoy the ambiance. The food was excellent. The only downside was that we only had one night to spend there. An extra day just to enjoy the grounds and explore the oasis would have been a good idea."
 September 2018,5,Pure BLISS,"Everything about L’Ma is perfect. The location, the rooms, the lush garden, the heated pool, the food, the staff, the beautiful dining room and lounge area with contemporary Moroccan design. Congratulations Vanessa and Xavier, you have built something really special! If only I lived in Europe I would come there for a long weekend to relax. The Ouarzazate airport is only 30 min away. Best place ever."
 October 2018,5,Five star plus,"This place is really one of a kind. The garden environment creates a serene and peaceful place in which relaxation follows. The host is a delight and informative.I highly recommend you stay here at least one night to get a reprieve from the chaos of the big cities.stay here to eat well and to relax. The rooms are large and impeccably appointed.Vanessa has every place, garden, rooms and all public areas perfectly designed..It may be impossible to improve upon the design of this Riad. Stay here and find peace. Make a plan to stay two nights. The restaurant was delicious. We’ll come back to Morocco just to spend time here."
 September 2018,5,Little paradise,"This was the very best place I been in morroco, quiet place, nice pool, excellent food and amazing breakfast. The decoration and the design of the place was so good and very cosy. The staff was friendly and helpful. A little paradise in an oasis desert. Congrats"
 September 2018,5,Great oasis of peace,"We really loved our stay here. Very nice and helpful staff. We also booked a cycling trip with them. our tour guide Achmed gave us a interesting mini inside in the culture. The room was big, clean and fancy. The bed was very comfi and soft. Loved the atmosphere:trees,plants, animals and relaxing spots."
 September 2018,5,This was one of our favorite places!,"It can be a little challenging to find this place... it is on a labyrinthine path which is not well marked, and google will not send you to the correct location. But upon arrival, it reveals itself as an oasis with a particular attention to detail. The food was delicious, the staff were charming, the space is large with many sections to explore. Bocce, swimming pool, badminton, meditation. Lots of nice areas for kids to play, and some animals as well. Of the many places we visited in Morocco, this was the most French. The owner was charming and attentive, and there is a great piano there... it's perfectly out of tune!"
 September 2018,5,Our favorite place to stay on our trip!,"We only had one night at the L' Ma Lodge, and wish we'd had more. The Lodge is beautifully situated in an oasis of fruit and olive trees, a lovely pool, a bocce ball court and more. The main house is both the family's home, and a lovely place to relax and have breakfast and dinner. The entire property was done by Vanessa and her husband, in includes a school for their children. From the minute you walk in the door you feel like a very welcome guest in their homes. The actual guest rooms are located in a separate bulding; I didn't see any other rooms but our room was roomy, comfortable and just lovely. L' Ma Lodge is a lovely place to relax for a couple of days between destinations in Morocco. And they serve wine, that is local wine and quite good. L' Ma Lodge is a uniquely…"
 September 2018,5,Superb hostess and charming staff in a beautiful riad,"This Riad was beautiful. Staff were attentive and informative. The grounds of the Riad were lovely with fruit trees, gardens and lawns. Vanessa, the owner, is a charming Belgian lady who meets and greets you on arrival and provides a personal tour of her and her husband’s lovely property. Bedrooms were clean and comfortable. There were lots of lounging areas around the property and a lovely pool that we took advantage of. Dinner was excellent on both nights we stayed. I would highly recommend this property."
 September 2018,5,Fantastic stay at l’Ma lodge!,"We spent 2 nights at this beautiful lodge. It was the best of the 5 locations we visited so far and felt like heaven on earth. Vanessa, the owner, really understands what her guests need during a trip in Morocco. Attention to detail in everything: very clean and nicely decorated room, beautiful gardens (in reality even nicer than on the pictures) fantastic food and service and everyone speaks English very well. The atmosphere in this place is just great: very tranquil and relaxing. They are happy to help you with arrangements for activities and/or guides. We did a bike tour in the morning to the palmeraie with a guide, also very much worth a visit. So definitely go to this place! We could have stayed here for so much longer..."
 August 2018,5,Fantastic!,"L’Ma Lodge looks good in the pictures but believe me, it’s better in reality and everything about our stay was wonderful. We spent 3 nights in one of the suites for 4 people. The room and bathroom were very comfortable and well appointed but for me they weren’t the most important feature of L’Ma. The lodge is set in beautiful, well maintained grounds in the heart of the Skoura Palmerie. The pool area is clean and surrounded by many seating and lounging options, both sun and shade. This theme carries on throughout the gardens with many secluded areas to relax in under the lush vegetation. All of this was enhanced by the amazing staff who made our stay so comfortable. A special mention goes to Soufiane who had been left to run the place while the owners were away. He…"
 April 2018,5,Oasis in the Dessert,Loved this place! The owners were great and the food was amazing! Not to mention the grounds were spectacular! We wished we could have stayed longer here! You will not regret staying here! Thanks for a great experience!
 June 2018,5,Heaven in the middle of the desert,"Peaceful sanctuary where we didn’t want to leave! Every little detail is so thoughtfully & beautifully put together on this property, we wish we had more time to unwind either laying by the pool or enjoying the rooftop terrace. Incredible plot of land that the owners- a married couple - have built from the ground up. Relaxing and romantic. Many thanks for the kind hospitality and special dinner under the stars! We hope to visit again"
 June 2018,4,A hidden gem in a lush oasis.,"My daughter and I were enchanted by Vanessa's warm welcome, the gardens, the tranquil pool, our quiet and spacious room, the delicious dinner in the gardens, breakfast (the widest array of home-made jams ever encountered) amidst chirping birds and lush vegetation. She and her husband built this marvellous lodge, from scratch. Nothing short of a miracle. This is the perfect place to unwind with children, with friends or just as a two-some. They've adopted mother&daughter mules, a horse, and have goats and chickens as well. Lovely staff, too. Plenty of activities for everyone pending on time of year and the level of adrenalin sought (Vanessa will provide details upon booking). It's just too bad we only spent one night. Bravo a tous les deux!"
 June 2018,5,Heavenly Oasis,"Arriving in L'Ma Lodge, Skoura was akin to arriving in heaven. Vanessa has done an amazing job of transforming the large barren land into a truly magnificent oasis. Sadly we were only scheduled for one night, but the coolness of the gardens to hide away into and the inviting pool, left us wanting more. The evening meal and breakfast with Vanessa's home cooked treats, were mouthwateringly delicious. Rooms were well appointed and bright and airy but also provided cool and relax against the heat of the day. Well done Vanessa. Hope to visit again and for longer."
 June 2018,5,A Real Paradise,"My husband and I spent one night at the L'Ma Lodge and we were literally blown away by the beauty and the calmness of this place! It is a real paradise immersed in a awesome landscape. Everything was perfect: the room was beautiful, the food excellent and the staff very friendly. At night, we went up to the roof and looked at the starts, we had never seen so many!! Do it when you go there! We highly recommend it to anyone!!"
 June 2018,5,What a treasure,"Don't be daunted by the short, dusty back roads to this lodge. It is worth the apparent detour to discover the beautiful grounds and hospitable staff at this lovely lodge. The owner Vanessa was warm and personable and kept a sharp eye on the efficient operation of her accommodations. Highly recommended."
 May 2018,5,Oasis !!!,"We stopped here one night on our way from Marrakesh to the desert, we were told that was nothing to do in Skoura, but how wrong the person who told us this was, she probably had no idea that L'ma Lodge exists, walking through the door and the trees you are walking into a truly paradise we were simply amazed!! Vanessa the owner is a phenomenal host, she takes you to every single corner of the property from the farm where they have rescued animals, to the pool to the guest' house , our room: no words!!! huge and gorgeous decoration every single details has been thought ( that is why the spent all those many years in the make of this place); the pool is acclimatized which is great, food OMG so delicious and natural they growth their own vegetable, breakfast and dinner food was not…"
 June 2018,5,Beautiful paradise,"This lodge is beautiful. We stopped here as part of our desert travel package we booked. Vanessa, the owner, was a wonderful hostess. The property has been open for 4 years and there are 7 guest rooms. There is a sizable heated pool on the property which was refreshing after traveling. There are several locations throughout the property set up for lounging. Vanessa and her family have rescued some goats, donkeys and a horse that they have in the property. There are also several cats on the property as well. The food that was served for dinner and breakfast was superb. We had a wonderful time and would highly recommend this lodging."
 May 2018,5,A paradise oasis near the desert,"One of the best accommodation we had during our 7 nights trip in Morocco. Vanessa is such a warm and caring person and what she and Xavier did there is just wonderful. They are very careful with all the small details, and they make you feel like home. The location is very nice, it has a big green garden with many trees and intimate spaces to relax, a pool and even a small “zoo garden” with rescued animals. All the food they served us was ecological from their own garden, we even received as desert for dinner home-made ice-cream from bananas and coconut. The breakfast was very good with many choices of home-made jam. We liked very much that she constantly checked with us if everything is all right and if we are happy with the services provided. The room we received was a big…"
 May 2018,5,A Miniature Paradise!,"The husband and wife owners of L'Ma Lodge have created a small paradise within a beautiful palmerie in in the Skoura Valley on what once was an empty soccer field. Belgian born Vanessa, who is extremely warm and welcoming, designed the exquisite gardens and grounds that contain abundant flowers and numerous hidden spots with chairs, couches and pillows for reading and relaxing. There is also a lovely heated pool surrounded by sunbeds and a play area and games for children. The main house where meals are served (one can dine outdoors in suitable weather) is comfortable and stylish while the food is excellent and beautifully served. The seven rooms and suites are located in a building that is a very short walk from the main house and has a large roof terrace. We were very happy…"
 May 2018,5,Best place for a getaway!,"This was one of the best hotels we have visited worldwide so far. Vanessa was a great host and really helpfull. The staff was excellent, the food healty and delicious. The rooms were tidy and the pool was amazing. We will definitely visit L'Ma Lodge again!"
 May 2018,4,Beautiful property,"We really enjoyed our short stay at L’ma lodge after our desert trek. It was extremely clean and well maintained. The owner is a lovely lady and you can tell that her and her husband put a lot of work into the property. There isn’t really anything to do around the lodge as it is in a small town in the middle of nowhere, but perhaps that is the beauty of it. The lodge has a nice pool, beautiful gardens, and many places to relax. We also heard that they can organize excursions for their guests. The only thing we didn’t like was that it was a fixed menu. After eating so much Moroccan food having been in Morocco for 10 days already, we were looking forward to the Mediterranean style food that was mentioned on their website. However, we were served a soup and tagine, which was…"
 May 2018,5,A truly lovely experience!,"Our family of 4 (parents and 2 adult children) stayed for one night before heading to Marrakesh. As others have pointed out, the rambling and turning drive to the lodge did not prepare us for this simply beautiful property! We were greeted by Vanessa who gave us a tour of the property - heated pool, rose gardens, petanque area, many seating areas inside the main house and out in the gardens, and a group of rescued animals! Oh, and on-site herb and vegetable gardens too! The rooms were beautifully appointed and contained everything we could need. They were welcoming and artfully designed for comfort and elegance. Everything was airy and bright. Dinner was delicious (though our server was saddened by our dislike of eggplant) and the breakfast buffet delightful. We enjoyed…"
 April 2018,5,Heaven in the High Atlas,"My dad and I stopped here on a recommendation from a friend who visited on her Honeymoon, and we are SO glad we did. After a week of rougher accommodations in Morocco, arriving at L'Ma Lodge was a breath of fresh air, literally. The roses were in bloom and the gardens were stunning. We spent a heavenly afternoon reading in hammocks by the pool, relaxing on pillows, and watching sunset from the roof, before enjoying a delicious dinner. I would go out of my way to visit L'Ma again, and wish we had more than 24 hours there."
 April 2018,5,Very pleasant stay!,"Great place, with a huge garden with many cosy places to rest, pool, Boggia, very friendly staff with good humor, good food, suitable for families as well. The owner knows good guides if needed who can show you less known spots in the town and its surroundings."
 June 2017,4,Cool hippie boho style amazing place,"Lovely place! The coolest, hippiest and cozier around Skoura. Very well decorated, amazing gardens with numerous lounge areas. Very good food and nice and friendly owners. Would like to have stayed more than one night and will come back for sure."
 April 2018,5,Best stay in Morocco (and anywhere),My wife and I lucked out to get a room at Lma during the high season and it was the highlight of our trip. Sufjian and the whole staff were the most gracious hosts who met every need for us during our stay. It’s a must to eat at the lodges restaurant where we had the best meals of our entire trip. The grounds and surrounding Palmerie are also a treat to enjoy. This is one of the best hotels we’ve ever been to.
 March 2018,5,Exquisite Surprise,First you try to find the right road. Then you start down the road and begin to think your driver is lost. Suddenly you arrive to a magical place. The Lodge was constructed on an old football field using traditional methods and modern sensibility. It is stunning. They have planted 3000 plants and set set up multiple areas to relax and unwind. This is a real mix of sophisticated and traditional. They grow some of their vegetables and herbs. The food and the dining area are beautifully done and the food is traditional and excellent with some French touches. The owners are hands-on and attentive. The rooms are excellent. Go when it's warm and spend at least 2 nights to relax and restore yourself.
 March 2018,5,Superior food and extraordinary lodging in traditional manner...elegant,"Oh, how I wish we could have stayed more than one night. The grounds just call you to relax...by the pool, in a grove of trees, behind some bushes...all sorts of private nooks and crannies set up with chairs and cushions calling...come here, sit and relax! The meals were excellent, as well. This is an out-of-the-way gem that's worth searching for!!"
 September 2017,5,Heaven! Did not want to leave!,"We stayed at this gorgeous place as part of a tour with So Morocco. What a lovely surprise! It is absolutely beautiful! From the moment you are greeted by the front door, so much care and attention has been made to ensure your time there is as relaxing and care free as possible. We loved all the little chill out spots dotted around and the amazing welcome drinks & snacks when we arrived. The meal in the evening was delicious and hearing that some of the produce was grown within the grounds of the hotel made it even more special. A true oasis of calm. If I could give 6 stars I would! We will be returning!"
 October 2017,5,Beautiful and Relaxing!,"We only were able to spend one night here but it was great! The owner welcomed us upon our arrival and showed us to our room. Our room was beautiful - nicely decorated and super clean. The bed was really comfortable. The room was spacious and the bathroom really nice. The grounds are beautiful - full of plants and winding paths with little sitting areas scattered throughout. It is so relaxing, a little oasis. We had dinner and breakfast there. Dinner was so good! And most of the ingredients are grown right there! The salad was exceptionally delicious. Breakfast was very nice as well. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
 March 2018,5,A sparkling gem with the warmest of welcomes,"Vanessa and Xavier have created a superb haven on the outskirts of Skoura which offers the discerning traveller a tranquil base from which to tour the area and to relax. Beautiful gardens and pool, comfortable rooms, fresh and delicious cuisine and most importantly, excellent and courteous staff. Bravo."
 February 2018,5,Could be destination vacation!,"While traveling with 9 other women in Morocco, we spent one night at this beautiful resort. The accommodations were lovely, food was FANTASTIC and owners and staff were wonderful. I would definitely love to return and stay longer. I have already recommended this Lodge to friends that are talking about visiting Morocco."
 February 2018,4,An African oasis,"After navigating through what could most kindly be described as the back blocks of a nondescript village, entering the front gate to L’ma Lodge is an entrée to a world apart. This boutique seven-room lodge is a character stay par excellence. This personal creation of the owners it is filled with a collection of furnishings and cultural artefacts from across Africa. Much of the facility is al fresco – an embarrassment of amenities set amongst the expansive palm-drenched gardens of the property and atop the guest’s room building. The indoor facilities are taken care of in an expansive and tastefully decorated shared dining & living lodge. Our one-night stay was too short for a comprehensive assessment, but our impression was of a very stylish and relaxing oasis. Perfection eludes…"
 February 2018,5,Amazing,"Vanessa was a brilliant host and ensured we had our every need met. The Riad is impeccably styled and is an interior designers dream. Amazing food, amazing service and an amazing rooftop for sundowners. Thanks Vanessa!"
 February 2018,5,"A hidden gem in Morocco, Ouarzazate","We were very thankful to enjoy an evening at L’ma Hotel. The staff, especially Saufran (spelling?), was so kind and attentive. They helped make our dinner by the fireplace an evening to remember. Their attention to details, ensuring our rooms are warmed, mint tea upon our arrival, etc. truly helped us relax and took in the beauty of this hidden gem. The hotel is amazing. It has all the elements of modern convenience all the while provides a comfortable, homey feel during our stay. Well worth the time for such an incredible experience."
 February 2018,5,What a delight,Unfortunately we only stayed for one night on the way to the desert Truly what an absolute delight The room the service and the food were first class Wish we could have stayed longer Most definitely highly recommended
 January 2018,5,wonderful days,"normally we don’t write reviews. this wasn’t normal. thinking about the passing days in the lodge still puts a huge smile on our faces :) :) first and foremost: shukran & thanks to Sophiane, a warm-hearted & funny local who was responsible for the lodge during our stay. the owners were in europe, so he was our man, not only heart-educated but also our personal human-google for every question we had. we arrived after a long ride from marrakech on a cold but sunny day in skoura. on our first day we relaxed on the roof terrace, made friends with the cats and enjoyed the cozyness of our beautiful room. after a good sleep we woke up in winter wonderland - it was snowing for hours. people here haven‘t experienced this for years. they didn’t see that much snow in decades! Clearly, we…"
 January 2018,4,A hidden gem,"This lodge is absolutely beautiful. Hidden behind a plain wall lies a tranquil haven perfect for relaxing after a long day travelling. The owns are very welcoming and hospitable. The garden boasts an assortment of areas to sit and relax, as well as a play area for children and pool area. All of this is enhanced by the backdrop of the Atlas Mountains. Be aware that they do not accept credit card, cash only. This is important as drinks are not included in the tariff nor is coffee and tea supplied free of charge. We enjoyed our stay very much and would highly recommend this lodge."
 January 2018,5,Great Place!,"What an amazing place! L'ma Lodge is an secluded oasis in the middle of Morocco. We arrived in the evening, and its was bit hard to find in the darkness, but after we finally got there, we were delighted. The place is lovely, with beautiful grounds, very confortable rooms, nice food, and extremely accommodating hosts. Too bad we only stayed for one night..."
 January 2018,5,Charming and beautiful!,"We spent one night at the L'Ma Lodge and were thrilled and surprised at how beautiful the setting was and how charming the rooms were. Vanessa thought of everything and we only wish we had more time to spend there. The grounds are spectacular and you can tell that a lot of thought went into the design and the plantings. We were there in the winter and can only imagine how beautiful the gardens are when everything is in full bloom. Our guide recommended it and he was so ""right"" about it! The staff could not have been more accommodating to all of our requests. We will be back!"
 November 2017,5,One night in heaven!,"This peacefull place was like piece of heaven! Interior decoration is very elegant with moroccan twist. Staff is so kind, helpfull and truly professional. And the food...the best what I get during the whole trip. Worth of every euro!"
 November 2017,5,The greatest surprise of our vacation!,"After the strong rhytms and crowds of Marrakech it was a breathtaking moment to step inside L´Ma Lodge. Both the interior decoration and the garden were made with an exquisite taste and made us feel relaxed and most welcome. The staff, in our case especially Soufiane, made us feel so very welcome but unfortenately we were not able to show our appreciation to Vanessa and Xavier who were abroad at the time. Food was excellent and the ambiance during the dinner so calm and lovely. To stand on the roof terrace in the morning listening to the birds singing and seeing how the rising sun colored the mountains behind the palm groves was one of the most relaxing and memorable moments of my trip. I hope to return to this hidden gem of hotels one day! Tämä kaunis, viihtyisä ja erittäin…"
 November 2017,5,Shangri La in the Desert,We spent one night as we exited the Sahara Desert and were taken back by the beauty and peacefulness of this oasis. The room was very comfortable and homely and the staff was warm and very helpful. The food was 5 star quality with perfect portions. The use of Moroccan spices was evident and wonderfully delicious. We would love to comeback and unwind for several days to enjoy the peace in the desert.
 November 2017,5,Lovely Stay at L'Ma Lodge,"We just came back from a trip to Morocco during which we spent two nights at L'Ma Lodge. The property is beautiful, the staff are great and the food was amazing! The best food we had throughout our 10 day trip. Make sure you visit the Palm Groves during your stay and try to visit the local market of Skoura if it is market day. We hope to someday go back!"
 November 2017,5,An enjoyable stay,"My husband and I stayed at L'Ma Lodge just for one night this time, but have stayed there for three nights previously. The fact that we returned says enough about this lovely place to stay in the palm groves of Skoura, but I will continue...From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome by Vanessa and her staff. Soufiane, the Manager, gave us a choice of rooms and served us a delicious 'welcome' drink of fresh pomegranate juice with homemade biscuits and just-picked sweet dates from the garden. The gardens here are amazing - a beautiful place to stroll and there are plenty of private nooks and crannies with benches, floor cushions, hammocks and chairs. The pool area is clean and welcoming. Our room both times we stayed was very comfortable and had everything you…"
 November 2017,3,A place to stop between the desert and Marrakech,"The food was excellent and they had nice wine ! The room was visually appealling but the hot water was not reliable . The property is big , with an outdoor pool and beautiful landscaping . Internet was only available in a very small area beside the office and nowhere else on the proprty .We had prepaid but they didn't take credit cards for incidentals so be prepared ."
 November 2017,5,Extraordinaire!,"Gorgeous place in the middle of an oasis. Perfect place to relax, take walks and even go shopping. Food was delicious every time We were invited to go into the kitchen to learn and help the cooks. What an experience! Vanessa and her staff are funny, kind and so very helpful. She has amazing taste. Our only regret is that we did not stay at least three nights!"
 November 2017,5,"A great place, charming and beautiful","A beautiful, serene and charming hotel. Beautiful gardens, charming rooms, helpful and funny staff. A delightful place!! The owner is from Belgium and when she received you she explains the story of how she bought the land, built the hotel, snd planted the beautiful garden. A great welcome!"
 October 2017,5,Airy and light rooms,Excellent hotel with extensive grounds. Very well kept. Vanessa the owner is an excellent host. Airy and light rooms in separate building. Large heated swimming pool. Good food. Peaceful. Enjoyed staying 3 days. Highly recommended.
 October 2017,5,An exquisite stylish oasis!,"This small lodge is set within beautiful gardens. Everything has been thought out in advance with the guests' comfort and pleasure in mind. The food, most of which has been grown on the grounds, is absolutely delicious (a dozen home-made jams are arrayed at breakfast). We spent our time resting and reading either by the lovely heated pool, or in one of the cozy little private nooks that are nestled everywhere, heaped with colorful pillows. The owners are extremely gracious and helpful. We truly loved our stay here. Barbara and David"
 October 2017,5,Paradise Perfect!,"Our first stay during our trip through Morocco was at L'Ma Lodge. We drove there from Marrakech airport, a trip that took approximately 5 hours. It was a beautiful trip through the mountains. When we arrived at the Lodge the owner immediately welcomed us. She has a very warm personality. The rooms are amazing, every detail has been taken care of. Great bathroom, furniture, accessories. The swimming pool is also great (a little cold for us!) At night the kitchen staff cooked us a delicious vegetarian meal: it was so good we took some left overs with us so we could eat it for lunch in our car the next day. It was a pity we only stayed at the Lodge for one night, we could have stayed for a week and enjoy their fresh dates, pomegranates and almonds a lot more! See you next time!"
 October 2017,5,"Excellent guest house, highly recommended!","We stayed here just 1-night as a pit stop on the way from Marrakesh to Merzouga. And we regretted not staying another night here almost immediately! Vanessa is a great host and greeted us on arrival, served us a brilliant welcome drink and showed us to the room. She gave us a short tour of the garden, pool and all the relaxing places the guest house offers. The garden was mind blowing and pretty much all the salads, juices and jams that were served at meals were home grown (even the olive oil was pressed in house)! Rooms were neat and clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. Dinner was a 3-course meal which was delicious, as was the breakfast of home made Moroccan pancakes and home made jams! We didn’t use the pool but were told it’s heated at night to a lovely 28-degrees.…"
 October 2017,5,Honeymoon relaxation with such a warm host,"While staying in Morocco for about a bit over a week, we saw so many wonderful things - L’ma Lounge was truly one of our favorite parts. Vanessa and her staff are very welcoming, the gardens and grounds are just incredible. We played bocce, had beers and ate snacks at dusk, in the morning hung out in the hammocks before the pool - just a dream! We stayed in some other ‘fancy’ places that on the surface were similar, but nothing compares to the authenticity of both the people and grounds of here. I’d highly recommend (plus we’ll definitely be back!). Thanks again Vanessa!"
 October 2017,5,Beautifully Designed Boutique Hotel,We enjoyed our 2 day stay in this charming boutique hotel. It is beautifully designed and appointed and the grounds are magnificent. The staff cannot do enough for you especially the concierge Soufiane. The owner was always there to welcome us with a smile every time we returned from a day out.
 October 2017,5,L'Ma Lodge is a true oasis,"We were on a 14 day trip through Morocco and our ""discovery"" of L'Ma Lodge in the middle of the trip couldn't have come at a better time. We spent 2 restful nights on a truly magnificent property with beautiful grounds and accommodating staff. Vanessa Rotsart could not have been a better proprietor looking out for our every need. We were originally scheduled for a 2 story room, but I had become a little under the weather earlier in the trip, so Vanessa made sure I was to be moved to a more convenient room. It seemed that no request was too much. I would highly recommend this wonderful property to anyone traveling to this part of Morocco (which should be everyone) Howard D."
 October 2017,5,Paradise in Maroc L'Ma lodge,"It is the absolute best place to stay in Maroc! A true oasis in Skoura. A very clean open kitchen with nothing to hide (great food), and a garden that will blow your mind! The rooms are beautifull and very clean! Staff is helpfull, flexibell and very kind. Special thanks to our host Vanessa we had a great stay! And thank you for the music 🎹🌴"
 September 2017,5,Restful and excellent service,"Spent 2 nights at this lovely property. Rooms were in a separate block from the main lounge/dining area. Nice pool area and gardens to walk through. Many lounge areas around the property..and hammocks! Outstanding staff and service here. Breakfast and dinner included in rate. Breakfast was a usual spread of cheese, hard cooked eggs, various breads ( crepes, fry bread, cake, buns) yogurt, juice, cereal and an amazing assortment of jams and condiments all made in house. I especially enjoyed the Strawberry & lemon preserves as this is a combo I make myself and have never run across anywhere else. Rooms were a reasonable size with a small lounge area. Shower was good with hot water and good pressure. In-room safe for leaving valuables. This would be a lovely family retreat for…"
 October 2017,5,An amazing place to stay in the Oasis!,"This was a wonderful place to stay......beautiful rooms, beautiful gardens and great pool. It is definitely difficult to find! However once there one has no desire to leave! Breakfast was great. The evening we were there it was tajine.......we would have preferred a choice of something else as by then we were tajined out! They do serve wine. Definitely recommend and would love to return!"
 September 2017,5,A beautiful oasis in the middle of nowhere,"We stayed in Skoura after camping out in the Sahara. As you approach the L’ma Lodge, you travel on some back roads through areas that you are thinking - “you must be kidding”. And then you turn into the lane and find the beautiful property. Before we were out of our car, the owner Vanessa was there to greet us. The rooms were beautiful as were the grounds and pool. They have beautiful gardens, citrus trees and date trees and vegetable gardens. Fresh food for our meals. I even spent time in one of the hammocks, having a little relax time before dinner. Food for for dinner was wonderful - we ate outside. Once again Vanessa was always around, making sure everything was okay. we had a nice bottle of Moroccan wine, which was reasonably priced. Breakfast was a…"
 September 2017,5,I wish we would have stay longer....,"What a beautiful place! Tastefully decorated all around. The accomodation was very clean and confortable. The garden impeccable. The owner and staff where very nice and the service was overall excellent. The food was particularly delicious we had a chicken tagine which we found to be the best of all the ones we had during our travels in Morocco, the dessert a fig crumble was so delicious. A generous breakfast was served buffet style. The palmeraie tour option was interesting and informative. Overall it a wonderful experience."
 September 2017,5,Paradise in the Oasis,"My husband and I only had two nights here and I wasn't feeling very well (travelers' tummy), but this place is spectacular. If I ever find myself in Morocco again I plan to stay at least a week and I will never leave the property. The owner is one of the loveliest and most gracious ladies I've ever met, and she has created a little island of paradise in the midst of the larger oasis. Inviting seating /lounging arrangements abound and cater to any desire you might have; be it falling asleep with a book on your chest, an intimate nook for lovers, cozy situations for small groups or casually comfortable places for larger groups. We took refreshing dips in the pool each afternoon and enjoyed the happy sound of laughing children nearby. Our room was spacious, well appointed and we…"
 September 2017,5,Hidden Gem,"We are 3 friends from Melbourne & Hobart, Australia. We stayed at L'Ma Lodge for 1 night between camping in the desert & Marrakech, on a nine day tour of Morocco. The Lodge could not be faulted. It was absolutely amazing! Our host, Vanessa, was friendly & helpful. She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable & it was as if we were guests in her home. The room, a queen & 2 singles, was beautifully decorated & exceptionally clean. Dinner was delicious & we were happy to see cornflakes on the menu for breakfast! There were of course many lovely Moroccan treats as well. We would thoroughly recommend this property."
 September 2017,5,世外桃源般的酒店 Paradise-like Hotel,"这个酒店非常不错。从花园庭院悠悠小径到别具一格的房间，都体现了这位漂亮比利时女主人的品位。酒店的环境安静优雅，房间干净而舒适，酒店的工作人员和老板很热情，早餐也不错。值得推荐。 This hotel is excellent. From the garden courtyard to the unique style of the guestroom, all reflect the taste of the beautiful hostess, the owner of the hotel. The hotel is quiet and has elegant environment, the room is clean and comfortable, the hotel staff and the boss are very nice, breakfast is also good. Worth recommending."
 September 2017,5,Excellent honeymoon stop off on our way to the desert,"After a long drive from Marrakech it was a real treat to step behind the walls and in to this wonderful oasis! The gardens are beautiful, the main house an interior design dream and the room just wonderful. The outdoor shower (as well as indoor!) was amazing! We loved the welcome drink, the dip in the pool and exploring the garden. We just wished we had spent longer to enjoy more! Dinner was great, catering for our veggie needs, as was breakfast. The staff team were excellent and the owner made sure she introduced herself and that we were happy. A great place!"
 September 2017,5,"A lovely place, excellent value for money!","My colleague recommended this place to me as her favorite of her trip to Morocco and it was a great recommendation! It is a beautiful property with a large, lovely garden owned by a Belgian couple. The owner, Vanessa, greeted us and spoke to us multiple times through our stay, making us feel special. She told us how they literally built the houses and grew the garden from the ground up so there is a lot of love here. There were only a few other couples there and we loved the tranquility of an afternoon at the pool and a DELICIOUS dinner (They have alcohol too). We got a suite on the top floor and the room was so clean and decorated to a high standard, we loved it. We had been looking at Dar Ahlam as an option in the area and I am convinced we got something just as nice at a…"
 September 2017,5,Amazing place,"Vanessa and her husband are the owners and our hosts. Amazing people, they have made there own oasis here. The room was lovely, staff are like family and go to great lengths to make you feel like family. Food is amazing and fresh, a lot fresh from the gardens. We were asked to have input into menu on our second night. Can not recommend this place enough. A must for any in the area."
 September 2017,5,Almost lost for words...Fantastic!,"I'm not sure where to start as there is much to praise about this beautiful place. My wife and I stayed here on two separate nights to break up a lengthy self drive journey into the desert, having discovered L'Ma Lodge by chance in a newspaper article and booking it based on the glowing reviews we found on the internet. It's probably the best decision we made on our first visit to Morocco. Initial communication from the owners, with driving directions, was within a week of booking. The owners, Vanessa and Xavier, have taken a rough piece of land in an oasis in Skoura that contained nothing but a few palm and olive trees and they have turned it into an absolute treasure. The attention to detail is evident everywhere. They have created a beautiful garden with relaxing lounging…"
 June 2017,5,Amazing little escape on way to desert,"Our travel agent Blue Men of Morocco suggested l'ma when we didn't love the lodging options in quarzazante to split the trip out to the desert. I am so glad she did. From the moment we arrived, we loved L'ma. Vanessa, the owner, was so kind and gracious, as were all the people who worked there. Felt more like friends than staff, but super attentive friends. 😉When we arrived the first night around 5pm, we saw the property and were so bummed we had to leave at 9am to go to the desert that we contacted Blue Men and talked with Vanessa to arrange a return to the property the night after the desert. That night she put us in a room in the riad with an outdoor shower. So lovely! And when we returned from the desert around 3pm, we sat by the pool all by ourselves for hours. Felt like…"
 June 2017,5,Fantastic place!,"In the middle of the palmerie is this fantastic lodge, the perfect place to relax after a day out exploring. Saufiane and his team were extremely friendly and gave us tips on what to do and where to go. The garden were luxurious and the pool area was great; the room was spacious and clean; the food was superb. I will definitely go back!"
 June 2016,5,Day Dreaming,"When I think back on my trip to morocco it is L'Ma lodge that I daydream about. Arriving to the oasis after coming across the desert this lodge is nothing less than a dream. The rooms were beautiful and well appointed, wifi was only available in the communal lodge area and was slow but there is plenty to do other than be on the Internet. We spent the day by the poorelaxing, and another exploring the local Kashbah with a local guide. Watched the sunset over the palm grooves on the lodge roof. The food in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast was some of the best I've ever had. Never have I seen so many types of honey. If Morocco is in my future I can assure that L'Ma lodge will be as well."
 May 2017,5,Perfect holiday location,Great experience! The owners built a true paradise in the Skoura plantation. The team of people working in the hotel make it an amazing experience to stay in the hotel. A true recommendation for everyone!
 May 2017,5,Beautiful oasis in an oasis,"We had only one evening at this gorgeous place. It was not enough. The owners have created a remarkable environment with fantastic food and delightful rooms. We surprised ourselves by sleeping with the windows (fully screened) open and the fan on but no air con. We don't like hot weather so that is not something we typically do but there was a subtle message about saving energy that got to us and it was lovely to hear the nightlife and the birds in the morning. (You actually have to ask for the remote for the air con unit which was just enough of a disincentive for us and it worked.). The staff were all, to a person, friendly and helpful and very comfortable with their roles and proud of their Lodge. We were shown through the garden where they grow a lot of the vegetables…"
 May 2017,5,Surprising find,"This small charming hotel was a welcome relief after a long drive across the center of Morocco. The rooms were generous and charming. The service was outstanding and the chef obviously cares about his cooking! The food was among the best we had in the eastern half of the country. Vanessa, one of the owners, paid particular attention to the details. Lovely gardens as well."
 October 2016,5,Relaxing spot in Morocco,Wife and I stayed in a wonderful room here at L'ma Lodge. The pool area and gardens were highlights of the beautiful grounds that are instantly relaxing. Food was excellent and the service was even better.
 April 2017,5,Full Service Relaxation,"Our group of 5 women had just spent 2 days in the desert, where we'd been in a sandstorm. We were gritty and tired after a long drive from our desert encampment. From the gracious greeting by the owner, to the pure pleasure of wandering through the cool gardens on our way to our spacious, airy rooms, we knew we were in a special place. The dinner, most or all locally grown, was perhaps the best we'd had anywhere in Morocco. Designed, planted and built by the current owners, this oasis lodge is truly a gem. We wished we could have spent more than one night there, recharging our batteries, for the next leg of our travels."
 May 2017,5,A True Oasis,"A very unprepossessing drive in but then the gate was opened and instant calm and beauty lay before us! Beautifully built and decorated with wonderful gardens and relaxing nooks with rugs and cushions abounded. Wonderful friendly welcoming staff and owner as well as a delightful family of cats and kittens! We had one of our best dinners here, fresh salad, tasty dressing, flavoursome moist tagine and delicious dessert with a very nice reasonably priced wine.... could be the French influence! The room was like a 2 bedroom apartment without a kitchen, king bed, great shower all the bath accessories, and wonderful bed linen! Nice breakfast with the biggest collection of homemade jams. Highly recommend."
 April 2017,5,A Gem in the Skoura,"L’ma Lodge is a true gem in the Skoura and we were so fortunate to have discovered it. We weren’t too sure what to expect as the pictures on the hotel website are not too descriptive. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised to find what feel like a personal oasis; a beautiful and welcoming haven. We were immediately greeted by Vanessa, the owner of the hotel and other staff members who quickly made us feel at home. The property is filled olive and fig trees, roses, palms, and other edible plants that are used on a daily basis at the restaurant. The owners have done a great job at creating many tasteful nooks throughout the property with hammocks; lounge chairs, rugs, cushions, and lanterns - giving the place a very stylish and cozy feel. If you go, don’t miss the…"
 April 2017,5,fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!,"what's not to love about this property. The beautiful living /dinning area , the luscious gearden, the perfectly appointed rooms, the friendly helpful staff and owner?!?!?! this is located in the middle of the oasis crazy little roads to get to it, then you arrive and is a mirage. GORGEOUS! They grow all kinds of fruits olives dates spices which they use in their kitchen. I saw the date palms and i asked if thry give fruit, well @ diner they bought me a bowl of dates beacuse the owner remembered i had mentioned it. I SO RECCOMED THIS PLACE. I stayed @ La Mamounia in Marrakech and this was just on par with them really! i mean i a smaller scale but oh i cant stop thinking about it> at night the home cooked meals are superb(* included) .. even homemade ice cream. 5 stars all…"
 September 2016,5,perfect place to stay,l'Ma lodge was fantastic . we only stayed one night but wanted more . it is tucked off the main road but its worth the short drive . It is a perfect oasis with great staff and marvellous garden and a relaxing and welcoming pool Rooms are very generous and the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner was great . Its feels more like a home than a hotel and is very very welcoming
 March 2017,5,What a wonderfully relaxing stay,"Both me and my wife spent a night at the Lodge. From our arrival to the departure, the Lodge remained quite a remarkable and relaxing place. The owner - Vanessa - took pains to welcome us and showed us around the features of the Lodge and finally brought us to our room. Her attention to detail is evident in the design and layout of the garden and its various resting nooks. The room is well provisioned and very comfortable. From the welcome tea to the dinner and breakfast, all was well thought out and unique wonderful. The dessert after the dinner - lemon milk - is something we will remember for a long time. Vanessa was kind enough to share the recipe with my wife. To see Vanessa wave us off when we left was quite a warm experience. Though we came as visitors, we felt we left…"
 March 2017,5,An oasis within an oasis,"We overnighted at L'Ma Lodge en route from the desert, but wish we had at least an extra night to enjoy here. The lodge is beautifully designed with lovely peaceful gardens. We had dinner and breakfast, and both meals were excellent, with great service and very friendly staff. The owner takes the time to introduce herself to guests which is a really nice touch. It's a relaxed atmosphere, and guests are encouraged to step into the kitchen to check the evening's menu and meet the chef. If we get back to Morocco I'd plan a couple of days here to escape the Marrakech insanity!"
 March 2017,5,Lovely retreat in a desert oasis,We spent 2 nights here early March 2017. This place is stunning! The owners have built a gorgeous retreat with exceptional gardens & outside rooms decorated with Berber rugs and pillows. The pool is beautiful. The dining area is lovely with a 360 degree fireplace. Food was excellent. This is an ideal place to relax after visiting the Valley of the Roses nearby.
 February 2017,5,AN OASIS THAT YOU WILL WANT TO STAY FOREVER,"We stayed one night at L'Ma Lodge while doing a private tour from Marrakesh to the sand dunes. The lodge its a stylish beautiful retreat where you could easily spend various days pampering yourself in a tented spa, swimming in the pool and enjoying the beautiful gardens. The rooms are tastefully decorated to the smallest detail. We were warmly welcomed by the Belgian owner who makes you feel at home (thank you very much!) The lodge is a perfect place for families as well as a lovely retreat for couples. In short it is a paradise!!"
 February 2017,5,Subtle Artistic Gracious Retreat,"Very beautifully designed main Lodge , spa tent, and Riad with about seven rooms and suites. Vanessa and her welcoming team take beautiful care of you from the moment you arrive. They welcome families with children. The approach a is simple rural dirt road and then ...surprise...you arrive at an oasis of peace and beauty. Fantastic rooms, dinner, wine, breakfast and a great night sleep, but best of all the garden is interesting and a peaceful to sit ...there is a beautiful pool. Vanessa has a wonderful creative eye for decor and gardening. She and her husband have created a very special place. I hated leaving and long to return."
 February 2017,5,"Excellent retreat, oasis-like stop on the route to Zagora or Dades Gorges","We wanted to explore the eastern, more desertic aspects of Morocco, so from Marrakech we travelled across the Atlas mountains, visit Ait Ben Haddou and Telouet Kashba and the arrive to L'Ma lodge, a totally charming place to stay and take a break from the long drives through the different surrounding valleys. The food was delicious, the personnel very attentive specially the manager, Soufiane; the living and dinner rooms very cozy and comfortable, piano and chimney included, plus gardens with bereber-relaxing-rugs and cushions settings below the trees, truly welcoming!!!"
 January 2017,5,An oasis of travel tranquility!,I visited this hotel with friends in January after our Moroccan desert adventure and this hotel was a perfect place to prepare and relax before the madness of Marakesh. The lodge was exceptionally styled offering the perfect mix of classic Moroccan style and European sofistication. The lighting was calm and soothing and the many nooks and crannies within the garden would be an ideal retreat to relax for a few days. The dinner was perhaps my favourite throughout my whole two week stay in Morocco an exceptional home cooked Euro style Moroccan fusion Tagine with a delicious salad home grown within the gardens. Breakfast included a number of home made jams and preserves and fresh hot coffee. The waiter at breakfast was surly and abrupt however this was a minor bump on an…
 January 2017,5,Didn't want to leave!,"L'ma Lodge is truly a hidden gem. You would have no idea that you were going to arrive at such a place when you are driving down the narrow lanes to get there. Once the gate opens you realize you are in a touch of paradise. Vanessa, the owner, had exceptional taste in decor and she and her partner have created a beautiful retreat in the middle of the Palm grove. The design of the interiors and the gardens is fantastic. I loved walking around just looking at all the design touches. The welcome was lovely with a pot of tea and some yummy sweets. The rooms were stylish and very clean. The food was excellent and the kitchen was very accommodating of our allergies. It was so relaxing to sit in one of the many areas outside and read while listening to all the birds. The…"
 January 2017,5,Garden Oasis,"This beautiful hotel has the most delightful large outdoor private garden. There are many areas to sit and relax on chairs, cushions, hammocks in beautifully landscaped arrangements. The outdoor pool looked lovely. The buffet breakfast included 15 types of homemade jams and preserves that were the best we had on our entire trip. They also had crepes (Moroccan & French), breads, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt and eggs. Rooms were quite nice and beds very comfortable.Service was warm and friendly."
 January 2017,5,Enchanting getaway,"L'Ma Lodge is a very special small retreat lovingly created by the talented, gracious and welcoming owner, Vanessa LaGarde. Handmade signs direct you down a small unpaved road through an oasis of orchards to the beautiful lodge. The gardens, suites and terraces alone are extremely attractive, but in addition there are beautiful intimate spaces inside and out for relaxing and reviving from trips in the Atlas Mountains. On top of that, the incredibly fresh organic food is mostly grown on the property and beautifully and inventively prepared. The staff could not be nicer. Very highly recommended."
 January 2017,5,STUNNING,"This place is amazing. Out of Architectural Digest. No detail was spared. A group of 5 of us from NYC stayed here and, while only here for one night, it was a gorgeous oasis. The food was spectacular and the staff fantastic. STAY HERE!"
 January 2017,5,Beautiful lodge!,Stayed at L'Ma Lodge on our way to the Sahara. Vanessa and staff was friendly and made us feel at home. The lodge is located on beautiful grounds. The rooftop has great views! The dinner was delicious. Thanks for your great hospitality!
 November 2016,5,admire the garden,"the creators of this property get many kudos first they had to imagine a guest lodge and accompanying facilities and locate it in what was then an ordinary palm grove. then they arranged gorgeous plantings, creative settings, and lots of fun activities. a surprise awaits around every bend in the path. of course, good food, good service, and a friendly atmosphere combine to make this place magical"
 December 2016,5,A Pleasant Surprise,"My staying here was part of my tour package and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff and Vanessa were so friendly and made me feel at home. The food was so wonderful and so were the Riad's grounds. I woke up early and went to the roof top to watch the sun rise. I hate that I only had a one day stay, but I am definitely coming back. This place does not disappoint!"
 November 2016,5,Secluded paradise lodge near Skoura,Great accommodation and a fine hotel with spacious bedrooms in a great green setting. The restaurant and the grounds around the lodge are really welcoming. Secluded and quiet this hotel is really nice and has a real sense of space and tranquility.
 November 2016,5,"L'Ma Lodge, a really lovely experience",Vanessa and her staff were very friendly and helpful. The riad is quite enjoyable with lovely gardens and a fine looking swimming pool. A great place to stop if you are in the area and looking for a relaxing experience.
 November 2016,5,Wish we were there longer,"Everything about L'Ma is perfect. We loved the personal welcome from Vanessa and then the coffee and tea which we so needed after our long day of travel. The dinner (we had requested a vegetarian meal) was one of the best we had on our 12 day trip. I am still remembering the organic locally sourced salad and the Berber omelette, The main house has the dining area and currently the wifi, We were informed that the lodge with the rooms will have wifi shortly. The rooms are very well equipped and the setting with the gardens and terrace with Atlas Mountain views are just perfect. We will have to return for a longer stay."
 November 2016,5,An amazing oasis!,"The minute you enter the gardens and grounds of L'Ma you feel relaxed. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, the main house is fabulous, the breakfast had an amazing level of choice of fantastic food, the service was great but best of all is the gardens, the sound of the birds, the fountains and the grounds. Our driver told us the last guests he had decided to cancel their tour and just stay at L'Ma. I understand why- it would be very tempting."
 November 2016,5,Very charming and relaxed,"We had a very warm welcome with our baby of 1,5 years old. They have a beautiful garden with several relaxing hang outs. The central living room is Very cozy with a nice fireplace in the middle. The rooms are tastefully decorated with one of the best beds we had in Morocco. It is very clean. The food is very good. Moreover the staff is very professional, super friendly and also very lovely towards children. We felt like at home the 3 nights we stayed here. Thank you very much Vanessa, Xavier, Sofian, Brahim and everybody else for this memorable visit."
 October 2016,5,A paradise for parents and children,"What a place! We loved every moment in L'Ma Lodge, fantastic welcome by Vanessa & Xavier, discovery of a wonderful garden and perfectly warmed pool, delicious meals, lovely rooms, fantastic roof terras, super friendly and efficient staff, all this in an amazing environment, what a treat! Our young children had an amazing time exploring the garden and the palmeraie. We wish we had foreseen more time at L'Ma lodge, we will be back!"
 October 2016,5,Very relaxing and attractive place,"We only were able to spend one night but found this to be a wonderful and unexpected spot in the middle of an oasis, beautifully decorated, with delicious food and a warm atmosphere. The staff was extremely accommodating and gracious."
 November 2016,5,Paradise on earth,"This is a real oasis of peace,beauty and comfort! The lodge is a newish building decorated with a fresh and modern maroccan taste. You can feel the attention to details and passion that Vanessa and her husband (the owners) put in this project! Apart from the very comfortable room, with European level of comforts (hairdryer, toiletries, towels, etc) they offer a magnificent garden, with swimming pool, petanca and space to chill out. Breakfast was included and showed some 15 different types of jams and confits, all homemade with locally grown products. Plus homemade pancakes, plumcakes, bread. And juices, yogurts, cornflakes! Dinner was excellent too. Again everything locally sourced and fresh."
 October 2016,5,Exceptional beauty and comfort!,"We stayed two nights, would have stayed longer but Lodge was fully booked. Vanessa is a superior hotelier and hostess. She and her husband have created a beautiful walled retreat that combines the natural beauty of this locale with traditional Moroccan style and a vibrant modern aesthetic. The food and service are both exceptional; all the staff were friendly, helpful and really professional. Vanessa checked in on us regularly but discreetly, and arranged drivers and things to do during our stay. The pool is gorgeous, and the garden, rooms, common spaces are all exquisitely designed and maintained. Better lighting than in most places, which is a plus for aging eyes! Small details that represent the kind of attention and care that Vanessa puts into the Lodge: a selection…"
 September 2016,5,"Wonderful, a true oasis","A desert gem, the owners have done a phenomenal job creating an almost completely self-sustaining oasis. While a guest, you can enjoy countless areas to rest and relax under the shade of trees or on assorted blankets and pillows. The main house is comfortable and airy, the grounds immaculate (the fruit laden trees beg you to pick something, but you'll be reminded not to since they use what they grow--including all the olives from which they make oil). In the morning there were >15 kinds of home made preserves, jams, and jellies and, while we wished there were warm eggs, the volume of choices meant everyone found something delicious. Meals were great, service kind, and my husband and son loved the pool. Wish the curtains were a little darker at night and the sheets a tad softer,…"
 October 2016,5,Paradise in the Moroccan desert,"We stayed for one short night and wished it had been a month --- an enchanting oasis of calm, beauty, hospitality done in great style. Vanessa's garden is a soothing refuge and the meals were delicious. The property seems worlds away from the unforgiving desert environment. This is a very special place offering a memorable and unique experience in Morocco."
 October 2016,5,One Night is Not Enough,"We only had one night at L'Ma Lodge, and it was not long enough! Fantastic service, from the moment we arrived through to the moment we left. The room, the grounds and the lodge itself are impeccably clean and well cared for. Vanessa and the entire staff made us feel welcome and at home. A true oasis in the middle of the desert."
 October 2016,5,Hard to imagine being better cared for!,This is a lovely oasis of comfort and ease. From our greeting at arrival to our hugs at departure we had a wonderful stay. Vanessa and her team have created an oasis in the middle of Morocco. My only regret is that we didn't have longer to stay.
 October 2016,5,“Wonderful location to relax and recharge”,"We highly recommend the L'Ma Lodge as a outstanding destination for one night or a week. The lodge had efficient and first class systems (fixtures, ceiling fans, A/C,etc), beautiful gardens/pool, roof top areas and Moroccan. Most importantly the owners, Vanessa and Xavier, welcome their visitors as friends rather than hotel guest. Jim and Sue King"
 September 2016,5,home sweat home in a little piece of heaven,"A little piece of heaven. Your feels like at home and part of a great family at this Lodge. everything is done to make your stay magical. Great staff, great host, wonderful place and great food ! The best place I have ever been so far ...believe me you won't regret it !"
 September 2016,5,A fantastic place to chill.,"A fantastic haven of tranquility great interior design and amazing gardens. The staff only add to the experience of the relaxed comfort that Vanessa and Xavier have created here at L'Ma. A recipe for a successful business has definitely been created here, with care and attention to detail."
 April 2016,5,What an oasis of piece and friendliness in the desert of Morroco,"We stayed here 6 nights because we wanted to have a sort of city trip and to enjoy the environment of Skoura and also because we read the good comments of L'ma lodge. We wanted to travel with our grown up children and their 2 boyfriends because 1 of them was running the Marathon des Sables (MDS) at the time. As we are also traveling with a wheelchair... the combination of people and questions we had made us mailing and mailing with Vanessa…. in the weeks before. Oh...lots of mails and questions an she was so friendly all the time and helped us with everything. In the end we had to cancel the 2 rooms for the children (unfortounately) but still, this was not a problem! So we went only with 2 persons for 6 days and it was like coming to a family! We had a beautiful time! The lovely…"
 October 2016,5,A real oasis,"This was a dry, barren soccer pitch 8 years ago before the owners took it on and grew a spectacular garden with quiet peaceful nooks and social gathering spots. A tasteful layout, sumptuous vegetation, warm welcome and delicious candlelit food on the terrace."
 September 2016,5,Very nice and beautiful Hotel with large garden.,"Very nice and beautiful Hotel with large garden. Delicious breakfast and dinner. Staff is nice. Hotel is also serving beer and wine. Large and beautiful rooms in oriental style. Hard to find, so view an map before visiting."
 September 2016,5,Best stay in Maroc!!,L'Ma lodge is a fantastic place to stay! The rooms are absolutely fabulous and super clean! The garden is even more beautiful! So much eye for detail! It was by far our best stay in Maroc! Vanessa the owner is a lovely person! Her staff is Super friendly And helped us with eveything! Dinner is great And also the wine was very good! Hope to come Back Some day!!!
 September 2016,5,Paradise,"It's hard to know where to start on the good things to say about L'Ma Lodge: magical garden, beautiful rooms, fantastic food, super-friendly people. The garden is bigger than it looks on the website. It is full of date palms, fruit and nut trees of all sorts (pomegranates, almonds, olives and many more), gorgeous grasses, roses, vines, vegetables and herbs. The garden is laid out beautifully to create private corners and hidden places; where you'll find a hammock, or a shelter, or cushions and carpets to relax on. Lanterns give it a magical aspect in the evenings. There is a fantastic boules court, shaded by overhanging trees, and a lovely swimming pool. Exploring and spending time in the garden was an absolute delight. Such a delight that it was a struggle to persuade anyone to…"
 May 2016,5,A Secret Garden in Skoura,"We did not know what to expect at L'Ma and were absolutely blown away. After hours of driving in the dusty desert and transferring to an SUV to navigate the dirt roads in Skoura, we arrived at L'Ma lodge. The grounds are an absolute paradise filled with all sorts of plant life and birds. We truly felt like we had found an oasis. The staff was wonderful and welcoming, the food was delicious (they had over 20 homemade jams at breakfast!) and the lodgings were elegant and comfortable. We only had less than 24 hours there (we spent the night between the desert and Marrakch) and both my husband and I wished we could have stayed for at least another day just to enjoy the lodge. It was so peaceful and the perfect stop for weary travelers or anyone looking for a little nature and rest…"
 September 2016,5,Excelent place,"We are a 11 people group of family and friens and we had a great stay. The hotel is beautiful, with excellent taste. The garden is a marvel place to rest, read and get together, we were superbly received. Dinner was very good, five stars! Congratulations! and thank you to the whole team!"
 September 2016,5,A Gem in Morocco,"We are travelling from Marrakech to the Sahara and were recommended a place in Ouarzazate, the Moroccan movie capital, but fortunately we had done some homework and decided to travel the extra 40kms to L""Ma. It is the most gorgeous and friendly B&B we've ever stayed in. Vanessa the hostess was just wonderful and really helpful and had created this oasis of calm and beauty. Hard to believe when you drive through some of the surroundings but it was just so relaxing and enjoyable. The pool, the rooms, the lovely chairs and tables outside were all a welcome relief at the end of the day and the cooking and meals outside were superb. Can't speak highly enough of both the setting and the people."
 August 2016,5,The Secret Oasis,"After 7 hours driving from Merzouga, a bad night sleep in the tends in beautiful Sahara, we could never thought we would have a reward like this. The place is absolutely amazing, quiet and full of cozy details spread around the property. The food is amazing and last but not least, we found the best staff of all. Everyone is helpful, kind and nice, specially the greatest Soufiane. He is the best host. We forgot something in the Hotel and the owner and Soufiane are trying really hard to send it to us. We will come back. ""Queen and Ernest"""
 August 2016,5,Paradise in Marocco,We stayed at L'ma Lodge for two weeks in August and everything we experienced was just perfect. The place is so very beautiful with many extraordinary beautiful little extras that make you feel the love the owners and staff feel for it. All the staff members were exceptionally loving and caring but at the same time left us enough space to make our own experiences. We felt like home at once as we entered L'ma Lodge and can only recommend. Skoura is a very interesting place to visit and L'ma Lodge makes your stay better than you could ever imagine. We feel very thankful for Vanessa and Xavier sharing their paradise with us.
 August 2016,5,Best stay in Morocco (or ever)!,"This is a genuine paradise in the middle of the Oasis. I felt like home. A place to let your soul and heart wander and be in peace. The athmosphere created there is with such love to detail and at the same time easy and light. The staff is wonderful, so attentive and empathic and will do everything to make you happy - and you feel that this is purely authentic and not because they have to."
 June 2016,4,Particularly nice for the decor and grounds,"We stayed two nights at L'Ma. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained, the decorations in the house and guest room are delightful and well chosen. Soufian, who works there, is helpful and kind, and the pool is warm and inviting. The seating on the pool deck is not particularly comfortable. The food we were served for breakfast and dinner was wholesome and above average. While we loved the design of our room, the sound proofing left a bit to be desired--we spent little time in our room but while there one late afternoon, there was quite a bit of noise--ukulele playing from another guest room and what sounded like night stands being dragged across the hard floor for almost an hour in the room directly above us. We'd requested an upper room but weren't given one. Wifi is not,…"
 June 2016,5,Paradise we found,After spending a fun but exhausting night camping in the desert we were lucky enough to spend the next night being pampered at L'ma Lodge. Wow this place is amazing! The most beautiful setting and staff. Although only spending one night there we left feeling rested and relaxed. Vanessa has done a wonderful job with this resort. It's a special place.
 May 2016,5,an oasis in the desert that refreshes your body and spirit,"All your senses are satisfied when you stay here. Vanessa, the owner is the queen of hospitality. Personally welcoming you and overseeing every detail of your stay from the huge assortment of delectable spreads and accompaniments for your morning crepes to the luxurious creams and lotions for your bath. Stay in the room with the outdoor shower . She and her staff are lovely, wanting to make sure you are absolutely comfortable and content. Did I mention that the rooftop is covered with Berber rugs and pillows for relaxed viewing of sunset over the Atlas mountains? When you get bored of that peaceful spot you can head over to the pool which is surrounded by lush gardens including a small wheat field that provides grain for the bread that is made daily and is served with argon…"
 June 2016,5,Wonderful Place to stay,What a surprise. Off the beaten path is a beautiful resort. You need to see this place for yourselves. Amazing and stunning. The pool is wonderful and the food is top notch. It's worth checking out if in the area or passing through. 5 star lodging.
 June 2016,5,Amazing Lush Retreat,"Incredible property. We spent one night after our stay in the desert, before heading to the Atlas Mountains. The owner greeted us as soon as we arrived, and she made us feel very at home throughout our stay. We got lucky and were the only guests the night we arrived so we had the beautiful facilities (great pool, amazing gardens, endless hammocks) to ourselves. The food was also some of the best we had throughout our stay in Morocco - of particular note were the lamb tagine for dinner and array of delicious homemade jams for breakfast. Highly recommend staying here, we hope to be back!"
 March 2016,5,Wish we had booked more time here!,This is a beautiful spot in the middle of an Oasis...literally. We only had one night but wish we had booked a couple. The owners were wonderful and the place beautifully decorated. Both dinner & breakfast we great.
 March 2016,5,Paradise in Morocco's best Palmerie,"There's nothing like home (luxurious one) in the midst of your travels in Morocco. Everything was perfect at the Lodge! The ultimate hosts Vanessa & Xavier, designed/made/refined all the details to afford a true oasis of beauty: most comfortable, lovely room (ours upstairs), the private nooks of quiet (hammock under the palms), the exquisite dining room with gorgeous Moroccan food (breakfasts are sumptuous) & service, and the tranquil setting around the pool. We could easily stayed for a week (great value for the money) using L'Ma Lodge as a base to explore South Morocco, from the desert to the mountains to the sea, all within a day's drive."
 June 2016,5,Totally delightful!,"Staying at this beautiful site for only one night was a tease! We were sorry not to have more time with Vanessa, the gracious host, in the serene setting of her meticulously constructed lodge. Her welcome was warm, the pool was wonderful, the rooms were spacious and well appointed and both dinner and breakfast were delicious. It would be delightful to return for a more lengthy visit someday!"
 May 2016,5,You'll want to stay here longer!,"Do you know those places where the pictures are always better than the real deal? L'ma Lodge is the complete opposite! Pictures do not begin to capture this hidden gem. We travelled through Morocco for 3 weeks and L'ma Lodge was definitely the best accommodation we encountered! The lodge and it's lovely hosts offered an oasis of peace and greenery that we had been longing for whilst travelling through heat and sand. Every detail is taken care of and you can feel the love and passion that has been put into this place. Walk through the palmeries, take a relaxing massage, get your own local guide and explore or just be.. We ended up extending our stay because we did not want to leave. A big thank you to Vanessa and her wonderful team (Yes, especially you Soufiane :-)) for welcoming…"
 June 2016,5,What an awesome oasis in the desert!,"We stayed at L'Ma Lodge for one night as part of a guided tour from Marrakech to the desert. What a surprise! The drive into Skoura was a bit dodgy, but once we arrived, the property was awesome. Vanessa, the proprietor, greeted us with warmth and personal attention. She explained how it took 5 years to build the property from scratch and how she planted all the trees, flowers, fruits, and vegetables around. The garden was truly beautiful and relaxing. The pool was great, and there are tons of lounge areas, hammocks, and pillows lying around. The aesthetic was great and we felt instantly relaxed and at ease the second we checked in. Unfortunately, we were able to only stay one night, but it was a great experience and really I can't imagine a better place to stay in the area."
 June 2016,5,An Oasis Worthy of Lingering,"I cannot say enough good things about L’Ma Lodge. This property is a tropical oasis of tranquility and comfort. The pictures do not do it justice and I wish we had more time to stay here. The owner, Vanessa, has created a beautiful, lush oasis in the middle of the Moroccan desert. The pool is inviting and surrounded by loungers, hammocks, and complimentary straw hats. The main building and the guest room building were built by hand by Vanessa’s husband and local residents, and are new, pristine, and simply stunning. Our room was gorgeous, with smooth clay walls, lovely tilework, warm wood accents, and views of the surrounding palm groves. We had a small balcony and both an indoor and outdoor shower! You could tell that every fine detail was carefully thought out, from the…"
 April 2016,5,Stunning!,"I only stayed one night and wish I could have stayed more! Beautiful garden oasis with swimming pool and lots of separate chill out spaces like a Berber tent, hammocks and seating areas dotted about the garden. The service is great yet you still feel relaxed and at home and the rooms are very tastefully decorated and spacious. I had the pleasure of an outdoor shower with a view over the oasis in my room. Owner is really friendly and interesting and the food is very good. Highly recommend!"
 June 2016,5,A Gem in Skoura!,"We stayed one night at L'Ma on our way from the desert to Fez. The grounds are stunning with trees, flowers, vegetable gardens, pool, and petanque court with comfortable seating in shade throughout the grounds. The owner was wonderful and breakfast and dinner were excellent. We were sorry we could stay only one night as a second night of relaxation would have been wonderful after being in the desert for several days."
 June 2016,5,Oasis plus petit agritourismo,Owner Vanessa has a wonderful eye and exquisite decor. The lodge had many outside nooks for relaxing as well as heated pool. Plus she has many fruit trees and surrounding land where she grows much of the that is served.
 May 2016,5,breathtaking! Literally an Oasis in the desert!,"I cannot say enough about how beautiful this place is. It really is like an oasis resort as it has a pool, bocce ball and tonnes of hammocks and little spots to sneak away too. The gardens were completely designed by the owner Vanessa and is a sight for sore eyes! loved all the rose bushes, olive and date trees in the area. Had one of the best beef tagine of my trip here and the aubergine salad was to die for. The rooms are gorgeous and loved how they included arts and crafts from that area into their overall design. There isn't much to see around the lodge but the owner had offered to drive me to the market place and/or town. My goal was to read and relax and it fit the bill completely. I would definitely go back again."
 May 2016,5,Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!,"L'Ma was a wonderful place to spend the evening and get a good night's sleep before we move on to Arfoud, but we would have loved to stay longer. Located not far from Ouarzazate, L'Ma Lodge is a lush and tranquil haven. Everything was wonderful, the owners and staff were friendly and accommodating, the food and wine fabulous, the gardens beautiful and the rooms tasteful and comfortable. Whether you are staying one night or several - I highly recommend L'Ma Lodge."
 May 2016,5,Spectacular,"This small hotel located 1 kilometer down a dirt path is gorgeous. Vanessa and her family built the facility and provide superior service. It's a place to relax and enjoy the fine food and surroundings. Wonder around the property and see what's growing that may be part of your next meal. Most of the food is sourced on the property or from neighbors. Wifi was available only in the main building, not the rooms."
 May 2016,5,Heavenly! You won't want to leave.,"L'Ma is a wonderful retreat -- completely hidden and unexpected. It's a haven - with lovely outdoor areas, beautiful rooms and an extraordinary staff that can't do enough to be helpful. It's all a tribute to the owners - who created it from their imaginations. It's entirely Moroccan in style and spirit, but with contemporary touches that enhance the experience. Vanessa is a wonderful host(ess), whose spirit is evident in every corner. And as a bonus, the food is truly superb. After spending three weeks in Morocco, we can easily say this was the most satisfying place we stayed. You'll be giving yourself a treat if you stay here."
 April 2016,5,Relaxed stay with great food,"This Lodge had a relaxed atmosphere with attractive garden setting, pool and alfresco dining. Set in an oasis, and very private, it had wonderful food, both traditional Moroccan and some innovative dishes. We were able to have a cooking class with Chef. A valuable experience. A most enjoyable stay."
 May 2016,5,Paradise,"I have been living in Morrocco for 16 years and have travelled all over the country. L'Ma Lodge Is undoubtedly the nicest place I have ever stayed at. Everything is wonderful from the welcome on arrival, the beautiful gardens with a superb pool, the bedrooms which are beautifully decorated, not to mention the excellent meals. In addition, Vanessa and Xavier went out of their way to find a solution to a problem I had, I had lost my purse with the money I had withdrawn to pay for my stay and thanks to Xavier a solution was quickly found. I can but encourage any visitor to the kingdom to spend a few days here."
 May 2016,5,A true oasis!!!,"Our two nights here and our first real ""day off"" while traveling for two weeks in Morocco was a complete delight. When we walked through the doors after driving deeper into the driest part of Morocco, we were amazed - the flowers, green everywhere, palms, LUSH, I finally understood the meaning of oasis. Vanessa is a sweetheart and she has created a place that just swallows you up - you don't want to leave. The hammocks, pool, peace and quiet, pillows on the ground, the room, the comfortable common space, and the MEALS! All amazing, as are the staff - as fun, attentive, hospitable and kind as can be. L'Ma is a very special place. Thank you so much."
 March 2016,4,beautiful retreat,"a beautiful retreat after a long drive. Our room was a combination of modern and traditional décor, nice and spacious with an open bathroom (this may not suit some clients). Very friendly staff, good food. the grounds are beautiful being in the middle of a palm grove."
 April 2016,5,A Hidden Paradise Revealed!,"This is one of our favourite places that we stayed at during our 2-week Morocco trip. We only stayed for 1 night but we wished we could have stayed longer. We were 2 adults + 3 children, and we found L'Ma Lodge to be the perfect family-friendly oasis in the desert. The grounds are just beautiful and so lush. The owners, Vanessa and Xavier, bought the land some 12 years ago and planted over 2,000 trees/plants to create a verdant garden for their 14-room lodge. The owners and their children live in the property (on a separate house) and they always make sure everything is alright with their guests. There's just the right amount of privacy for those who want to get away, but also within easy reach if you need anything from the staff or the owners. Service is impeccable. Rooms are…"
 March 2016,5,Serene ambience,We stayed in this lodge for a night but I wished so much that it was at least a couple of nights more.Vanessa not only gave us a warm welcome but played a perfect hostess to us and all the other guests throughout. The food was excellent and so was the overall ambience. Do long to return back for a longer stay.
 April 2016,5,the most wonderful property we stayed in in Morocco,"L'Ma Lodge in Skoura was an absolute delight in every way. My husband, 20 year old granddaughter, and I so appreciated, after a very long car ride over the Atlas Mountains, the warm and hospitable welcome from our charming host, Vanessa.She and her husband, Xavier, designed and built this most beautiful property, an oasis of fig and orange trees amidst beautiful floral landscaping. Of all the many properties we stayed in on this most special trip to a most special country, L'Ma Lodge was our favorite!"
 March 2016,5,Magical Place,"This is a hidden gem in the Palmeraie of Skoura, a beautiful town with many old berber casbahs. L'Ma Lodge is a house designed and built by the owners with the help of local craftsmen. All structures and the gardens are beautiful and the interior design is very tasteful. The owners are delightful and interesting people, and of course, multilingual. The staff is extremely friendly. And: the food was fantastic! We had a lovely stay."
 April 2016,5,A beautiful oasis,"When we (my boyfriend and I) arrived at L'ma Lodge we were taken aback by the beautiful gardens and the warm and smiling staff that welcomed us. From the previous reviews on TripAdvisor we were pretty certain the place was beautiful, but we never imagined it to be the heaven on earth that it is. Food was excellent (they grow their own vegetables in the garden), service was incredible and the surroundings are breathtaking. They have a beautiful pool, lots of places to relax both indoors and outdoors and a roof terrace with a view of the Atlas mountains. Our room had both an indoor and an outdoor shower (!), a balcony and everything else you should need and want. Sadly, we only stayed one night because we were on our way to the desert. We will definitely be back and this time…"
 March 2016,5,Peaceful Paradise,"After an amazing journey from Marrakech over the High Atlas mountains we finally arrived in Skoura, a small town on the edge of the desert.L'Ma Lodge lies in the palmeraie and is a house built and beautifully designed by the owners who also live there, so it is very much a home. We were welcomed by Soufiane with a big smile and nothing was too much trouble attitude! The garden is a delight and a pleasure to be in, whether its having lunch or just relaxing by the pool.The evening meals where in the dining room with a lovely open round fireplace in the centre of the room giving out warmth all round.The food was simple fare, well prepared. Every where was most tasteful and especially the bedrooms.We spent three very happy days and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere that had been…"
 February 2016,5,Hidden Gem,"We arrived late, and the last few kilometers were not well lit, but we managed to find it. Once we arrived we knew we made the right choice. Vanessa and her staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs. Dinner was marvelous, and the dessert was incredible! My favorite desert in Morocco. Not many choices to eat close by and if they were it would be very difficult to beat this meal. After being in Marrakesh for few days this was heaven. Wifi only in the great room,and parking right outside the lodge. We are sorry we only stayed the night."
 March 2016,5,All Great - But the Food Makes it Soar,"We only spent one night and wished for more. Vanessa and her French chefs served us the most creative and great food we had on our trip. I would love to go back for cooking classes. A lamb and apple tagine had such incredible, sweet, honey basted apples that it has us wanting to try and re-create it at home. The lemon/lime drink with its combination of juice and thick zesty foam was delicious and fabulously creative. The home-made jams made on-site from ingredients grown in the garden was visually stunning and very fun to try. The garden was a delight to wander through. The home where we dined was elegant with wonderful evening lighting. I would love an evening there just to read and bask in the fire. Our room was beautiful, a nice ceiling fan and open window with a screen that…"
 March 2016,5,Oasis within an oasis! Worth a detour!,The L'Ma Lodge is a real gem in the desert. Outstanding Service! Very nice and tasteful rooms. The meals were deliciouse. For the sunset you can go up to the roof and enjoy the last light of the day with wine and cold beer (alcoholic drinks are served!). In the big garden you can relax at the pool or play boule. A very nice place for children either. One of the best places to stay I have ever seen on the world!
 March 2016,5,Lovely!,"Such a great pitstop after a long drive from Marrakesh. Lovely people who made us feel at home right from the start. The garden is super pretty and the room is very nice too. A+ for design overall ;) and the food was awesome. We enjoyed our stay very much. Vanessa, we hope to come back and next time more than just one night!"
 March 2016,5,Perfection in the Palmeraie,"We stayed in this beautiful, peaceful place for five nights and had a wonderful time, thanks mostly to its owners, Vanessa and Xavier. The rooms are exquisitely decorated (I picked up a few ideas!), the beds gloriously comfortable with top class bed linen and the central heating was the best we've encountered in Morocco in the winter. Breakfasts were amazing - seventeen home made jams and several different cakes each day. The mojitos in the evening were really good as were the dinners with the starters and desserts being particularly innovative. Vanessa has a really good team of hardworking staff who were really friendly and jolly. Vanessa was a mine of information on things to do and places to go and when we drove up to the Dades Gorge she recommended a restaurant for…"
 February 2016,5,A real reprieve in an oasis,"Our only regret, having arrived at the Lodge, was that we waited till nightfall to arrive. The drive to the Lodge is an adventure by itself, winding through very narrow village pot bellied lanes. The owner of the Lodge, Venessa was there to greet us at the gates, and her enthusiasm to make us feel welcome at her ""home"" became obvious from the time we checked-in, which did not take long. The main lobby and restaurant area, the rooms and the grounds, have the hallmarks of been designed out of love, and it was love that we felt for the place. My highlight was getting up at the crack of dawn to see the Morrocon sun come up, bathing the whole area in its orange hue - and what a sight it was, you can see vistas of the atlas and parts of the desert landscape from the roof. All in all…"
 March 2016,5,Splendid! A truly delightful visit!,"My husband and I love Morocco and have visited Marrakech four times and have ventured on many day trips. This time we decided to be rather more adventurous and head to the Sahara desert. En route, to break up the long drive, we stayed at L'ma Lodge and what a wonderful surprise it was. The main house and the guest house, set in amazing grounds, exceeded any expectations. From the moment we arrived and sipped 'Welcome Tea"" in the gardens to the moment we departed after a most splendid breakfast, we were in awe! The warmth and friendliness of the owners and the staff made us feel welcome and special, the evening meal was a real treat. It was a set meal, no menus, we just sat by the fire and were waited on. Each course was superb! My husband is a strict vegetarian and was his meal…"
 January 2016,5,Beautiful slice of paradise.,"L'Ma is a wonderful surprise after driving hours from the desert. The location is amazing. I loved everything about this place -- the story of how the owners built the lodge themselves (incredible craftsmanship and taste), grow most all of the fruit and vegetables used by the chef, the flower and trees, my gorgeous room and bathroom, the rooftop strewn with rugs and pillows for hanging out while the sun sets, chattering birds in the palm trees. I had a little terrace off my second floor room that I wish I could have stayed and stared into the sky and trees for a very long time. It's very hard to find this kind of peace and tranquility."
 February 2016,5,One of our favorites,"We stayed at L'Ma lodge twice while on our recent trip to Morocco. We only intended to stay once, but ended up coming back unexpectedly after our trip in the desert, since we underestimated the time it takes to drive places. Both times, we were amazed by the hospitality that Vanessa, the owner, showed us. The rooms and the grounds are impeccably kept. The decor is so lovely that I considered hiring Vanessa to decorate my apartment!! The food was amazing. I could have stayed for weeks. If you go, don't miss going up to the roof to watch the sunset, and be sure you walk through the palm groves next to the property. And say hi to all the cats!"
 December 2015,5,Wonderful Surprise,"We were road weary when we arrived, but as soon as we entered the property, we felt calm and began to feel rejuvenated. This is a surprising and unique property with great service and amenities. We wish we had more time to explore the area and just relax there."
 November 2015,5,"Peaceful, lovely, & detail-oriented! A calming oasis!","My sister and I were fortunate to stay at L'Ma Lodge for 2 nights in November while on our way to Marrakech from the desert. It was the perfect place to relax and recharge. Some of the highlights: - Vanessa is the owner and visionary of this beautiful boutique hotel. She is an incredible hostess and will make you feel right at home. Nothing is too much trouble and her talents, creativity, consideration, and warmth. She can organize day trips and a variety of activities for guests for short and extended stays. - Lovely garden to enjoy and a lot of what you will eat will come from the garden too! There are pomegranate trees, olive trees, and beautiful roses. While we were there they were preparing the ground to grow wheat (very cool). - Best electricity we experienced in…"
 November 2015,5,Absolutely lovely!,"A small, beautiful hideway in a great setting. I have nothing but good to say about L'Ma lodge, it is quite simply one of the nicest places I have ever stayed. Highlights for me include the home grown olive oil, fresh dates from the garden and the wide range of delicious homemade jams at breakfast. The food is great and cook uses many home grown ingredients. The lodge is very children friendly with a small playground and a swimming pool that is great for even quite young children. Vanessa is the perfect hostess and her small number of (devoted) staff are quite wonderful. The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated - they even have ceiling fans rather than air conditioning ( a big thumbs up from me). I would love to visit here again!"
 October 2015,5,A jewel in the middle of an oasis.,"This is a truly dreamy place to stay. (Sadly we were here for one night only). Welcomed as we arrived by Vanessa, who took time to show us around the impeccably kept grounds. Rooms are spacious, airy, light and so tastefully decorated. Dinner was divine with fresh produce from their garden. Must return here for longer."
 June 2015,5,a really charming property in the palmeriah,"our stay at Vanessa and Xavier’s L’Ma lodge was lovely. She and her husband extremely well organised, and that becomes apparent soon as you walk into the (neat, tasteful and charming) property. She is quite jovial, and makes you feel at home quickly (like at a good B&B). The rooms were lovely, clean, and the property itself is a nice place to walk around, especially if you are interested in seeing birds. they have a lovely pool, which is kept covered when not in use…therefore quite clean. They also have a lovely informal area to lounge around..on a well finished concrete floor under a tree. In addition, there are dining seating options both inside and outside. we loved having various fruit trees around us all over the property, especially as they attracted birds. last but not…"
 November 2015,5,Wonderful surprise in the desert,"L'Ma Lodge is a wonderful relaxing hotel in the ""palmerie"" of Skoura. It is beautifully decorated as well as being very comfortable and quiet The food was delicious, using all homegrown materials. The gardens are full of olive trees and pomegranite trees among others. L'Ma Lodge definitely deserves a stay of at least 2 nights to really enjoy all that it offers. There is an outdoor pool and bocce ball court. Wifi is available in the main hotel but not in the room."
 November 2015,5,Oasis within an Oasis,"L'Ma Lodge is an outstanding place to stay in Skoura, with lovely rooms, great food, swimming pool, and lovely grounds for relaxation. Vanessa and Xavier are exceptional hosts who will help you plan adventures from the lodge. It would be helpful to rent a car in Ouazarzate to go to Skoura and do day trips beyond, but you can also go there by taxi and then the hosts will help you arrange tours and taxis from L'Ma Lodge."
 October 2015,5,Beautiful Oasis,"L'Ma Lodge is a magical place, very much an oasis in the desert. The garden is a perfect place filled with palms, fruit trees and flowers, a lovely pool, reading spots complete with hammocks and even a petanque (bacci ball) court. The rooms in the riad are as well appointed and comfortable as in many 5 star hotels and contain a lovely variety of art from the African continent. The rooftop has sitting areas and is a good place to watch the sun go down (or up). The dining-room and gathering spots are located in the main house. Homemade jams from fruit trees on the property are the highlights of the very comprehensive breakfast and dinner showcases the best of Berber cooking. There is a lovely walk through the palm grove outside of the walls of the riad. The staff couldn't be…"
 October 2015,5,Exceptional - treat yourself - very good value,We loved staying in this idyllic and serene property. The host and owner Vanessa is delightful. She clearly knows what people want and enjoy given her many years of experience in hospitality gained around the world. The staff were also well trained and personable. Newly built the rooms are very clean and decorated tastefully in a modern Moroccan style. The grounds are very large and lush with different unique spots to sit and relax including a heated outdoor pool. Although the grounds are large there are not that many rooms so your stay intimate and private. They grow their own fresh produce that you get to enjoy at meal time. Meal time was a treat. i experienced the best tangine i had in 2 weeks in Morocco (quince and beef). The breakfasts also a treat with great…
 October 2015,5,Peace haven in Skoura,"Vanessa is not only a true professional but also very friendly and welcoming. We were struck by the attention to details everywhere, all in good taste. It made us want to forget the rest of the trip and stay there for a week. L'Ma Lodge is the place to be in Skoura. Vanessa also organized the rest of our trip to Morocco with regular follow-up while on the road and good guides who were knowledgeable in all areas of Morroco. Encore merci."
 October 2015,4,Surprise,"We thought the driver was surely lost driving to this place...and then we arrived and the lovely hostess took over. Beautiful grounds, well decorated and interesting rooms and the dinner was divine. The couple who owns the place growing their own food made it extra special and healthy. Wish we had spent more nights here!"
 October 2015,5,Paradise to stay,"It is not just a place to stay; it is the place where you feel that you are really welcomed, taken care, where you can have a rest, discover surroundings. Vanessa and her husband have invested themselves a lot to create such a zen-place. Tasty interiors everywhere, beautiful garden with swimming pool, gourmet kitchen, and lovely staff. Not to mention a wonderful sunset that can be watched from the roof terrace of the guest house."
 September 2015,5,"If there were 6 stars, L'Ma Lodge would have earned it","L'Ma Lodge is not only situated in an oasis, it is an oasis itself: palm- and olive trees spread their branches above thick carpets of green lawn, roses and oleander flourish on each side of the many paths. Everywhere you find little cozy niches with hammocks, rugs and cushions and small tables to put your drinks on. All rooms are very tastefully decorated in a modern way of arranging traditional Moroccan handicraft items. What made this place so memorable is the personal drive, presence and passion of the owner Vanessa. She and everybody else around is incredibly friendly and helpful so that it is easy to forget the world around. This atmosphere made L'Ma Lodge clearly the best and outstanding choice on our entire trip through Morocco. We arrived here after some days in the…"
 September 2015,5,💜 l'ma,"Loved l'ma lodge. The food was excellent, especially the lemon milk dessert...I still have dreams about it :) This place was a real treat for us, it has a wonderful relaxing homey feel. The rooms were big and well furnished with comfortable beds and sitting area even though we spent most of the time in the pool! And it was probably the only time we walked on grass in morocco! The host Vanessa took very good care of us and even set up a walking tour through the oasis of farm plots and how the irrigation system worked, it was well worth it, very interesting. Thanks again Vanessa, we really enjoyed the couple night we spent there!"
 October 2015,5,"Paradise has a name: M'La Lodge, best accommodation in Morocco","What an amazing paradise.. Once arrived you will never want to leave! Vanessa and her husband have created a heaven on earth at its best! Wonderful architecture combining modern Moroccon elements with a stunning parc and overwhelming nature. A free size pool with lounge beds, Moroccon carpets and hammocks, quiet corners everywhere in the garden, most comfortable rooms ( we had a spacious suite for 4) with extreme cleanliness and perfect conditions of the whole property set in the heart of the Skoura Palmeraie. The breakfast was the best we had all over Morocco, homemade pastries, a huge variety of jams, marmalades, fruit and vegetables grown in their own property, attentive staff and great lunch and dinner menu (set menu with advance notice for guests only ). We have found our…"
 October 2015,5,"Woah, what a place!","Our favourite accommodation in the whole of Morocco! Vanessa and her staff are just lovely, genuine, caring and made our experience perfect! The place itself is full of fun activities, we swam, played bocce, cards, relaxed in hammocks... It was so nice to relax from the travelling around and recoup. The food was delicious and they staff always went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect. Definitely will go again next time we are in Morocco. This place makes us want to buy some land and open a B&B overseas!"
 September 2015,5,Plan an extra day to enjoy this place!,"We stayed here on our way from the desert. It was a beautiful place with great food, a comfy bed and warm hosts. We wished we had stayed an extra day to really relax! I can't imagine a nice retreat. Skoura was really lovely as well. I was glad that we stayed here rather than some of the other mid-point options."
 October 2015,5,Beautiful lodge in the oasis,"We had a wonderful three night stay here. Vanessa and Xavier have created a haven for relaxation in the Skoura oasis. Gorgeous rooms, beautiful mature gardens, delicious food and warm, attentive service. Thanks to all. We would love to come back one day."
 September 2015,5,An Oasis inside an Oasis!,"L'Ma is truly an oasis hiding inside the palmeries of Skoura - It's amazing what Vanessa and Xavier have built, and it is evident in every aspect of the place - from the amazing food (much of it grown on-site!) to the amenities (a heated pool!) and the amazing rooms and service. My only regret was not having more time here, as exploring the kasbahs and palmeries nearby is a day by itself."
 September 2015,5,An exquisitely restful retreat,"We were not at all surprised to hear that a previous guest had cancelled an entire tour of Morocco in order to extend their stay with Benissa at the L'Ma Lodge. We arrived hot and dirty from an adventure in the desert, on our way back towards Marrakech. We found a veritable haven of beauty, comfort and hospitality: a beautiful garden, best with discreet seating areas and comfortable cushions; a really beautiful room; wonderful food; and good conversation. It helped perhaps that there were few other guests: it felt as if we were the house guests of particularly tasteful and convivial friends. The view of the sunset over the palm trees was memorable. A great job by Benissa and her husband; and another excellent choice by Naturally Morocco."
 September 2015,5,A Literal Oasis in the Desert,"My wife and I stayed here for one night on our road trip between Marrakech and the Sahara. We were expecting fairly simple accommodations - just a place to relax and break-up the travelling. What we found was one of the best parts of our entire trip. The surrounding area is fairly desolate, with tiny villages and desert landscape all around. We came upon the door to the riad, stepped inside, and felt like we entered into a hidden paradise. The grounds are absolutely immaculate. The photos, while very nice, do not do this place justice in the slightest. It is a fairly large property, with a sizable pool, various tree covered seating areas, a bocce court (!), and other little hidden treasures throughout. The main building was perfectly decorated and it is abundantly clear…"
 August 2015,5,Beautiful grounds,This place was booked as part of our tour and we hadn't really looked at what it was like. We arrived to the amazing front door to be opened onto their stunning grounds and gardens. Fantastic places to lounge play cards and have a drink after a long drive. Words can not do justice to the care and thought that has gone into creating something very special. Our boys loved the pool (obviously) and also the seating areas under the trees to play cards. Dinner was a fixed menu included and was a stunning feast made with products from the garden and the local markets (the fig and goats cheese salad with honey dressing was stunning) and our whole family had a lovely feast. Our room was equally well designed for a family of four and was just perfect. Breakfast was also a delight.
 June 2015,5,L’Ma Lodge is a must!,"I moment I set eyes on the front door, excitement took hold. Located in a beautiful palm oasis, tucked away off the main road just outside of the village of Skoura one will find L’Ma Lodge. Six words summed up our stay at L’Ma Lodge…I WISH WE HAD STAYED LONGER. The staff at L’Ma Lodge were friendly & attentive. The owners, Vanessa & Xavier were fabulous! They are just the most lovely, genuine, relaxed, personable people - with keen eye for design. The property contains a main house & a separate villa containing seven guestrooms. Each room tastefully decorated with effortless individual style. We were lucky enough to stay in one of the suites which boasts a beautiful neutral colour palette, balcony & outdoor shower – it was just divine! We swam in the pool, played pétanque &…"
 June 2015,5,An oasis in an oasis,"As you drive up the dusty path, you wonder what possibly can such a place offer. Boy, did we get an answer! We parked the car and stepped into... PARADISE! so beautifully built, with gardens, a pool, amazing food, such comfortable rooms. We could stay there a week. Alas, we had to leave the next day. A must stay hotel, delightful owners and a great staff. Thank you so much Vanessa and Xavier, it was memorable."
 June 2015,5,Beautiful place to relax and eat,"Of the week I spent in Morocco I was so happy that my birthday fell on the day we spent at L'Ma lodge - by far the best of the 3 places we stayed on our trip. Beautiful grounds, friendly but discrete staff and the best food we had in Morroco. This is an amazing place to relax - I would highly recommend"
 June 2015,5,TOP!,"This was a great surprise. inside the palmeraie i can't even suspect the wonder boutique hotel is in. the staff is top, the architecture and the interior design of the build, the garden and the pool are all perfect. I want to return quickly."
 May 2015,5,Stunning Skoura Oasis!,"You must stay here as long as you can! We were so heartbroken to leave after one brief afternoon/night. A true oasis smack dab in the wide open desert landscape -- L'Ma Lodge exudes comfortable luxury. Vanessa and her husband (both European expats) have created a truly magical escape. Each and every detail is flawless -- from the stunning gardens to the gorgeous lobby and bungalows, from the incredible staff to the wonderful food. If we could move in, we would! Thank you, Vanessa, for making our trip to Morocco even more amazing than we could have imagined. - Alex, Barb, Betsy, Megan, Michaella"
 May 2015,5,An Oasis Within an Oasis,"L’Ma Lodge is a little off the beaten path, but once you arrive you will enter a beautiful oasis with lush green gardens, manicured lawns and a world of peace and tranquility. The main building functions as the reception, restaurant and social area, while the building with the rooms is at the other end of the property. In the middle is a pool, several sitting areas and several walking paths that ultimately connect the two buildings. The landscaping is done in such a manner that the compound seems much larger than it really is and you always have a sense of solitude. Dinner is an enjoyable event featuring a variety of local dishes, while breakfast is truly delightful and offers a wide array of homemade jams. The hosts, Vanessa and Xavier, make you feel like long lost friends…"
 May 2015,5,Piece of Paradise and Relaxing Heaven,"L'ma Lodge is a very special place to experience. The Soukra Palmerie is unique and beautiful and Vanessa and husband have created their dream and vision here in L'Ma lodge. The grounds are beautifully kept and laid out. The pool was gorgeous. The rooms were chic and a tasteful rustic style . Vanessa and her staff are amazingly helpful, friendly and intelligent and kind. I'm a vegetarian and had lovely breakfasts and dinner. Wine and beer available. Hard to find and get too initially but REALLY worth it. Recommend hiring good car at Quazarzate. Seemed family popular in holidays. Good place to explore from , if you can bare leaving this sanctuary. Sad to leave and highly recommend. Good value on all levels . Hoping to return one day Enshallah."
 May 2015,5,Wish we had more time!,"We stayed in L'Ma for one night on our way westward from the desert. If we could do it over, we would have extended our stay for at least another evening. The meals were incredible, the hosts (Vanessa and her husband) were extremely attentive, and the location was beautiful. The property is positioned amongst a diverse range for fruit and nut trees. I wish we'd been there during the harvest!"
 May 2015,5,Only regret is that we couldn't stay longer!,"We stayed here for a night as a stop off on the way to the Sahara Desert. Vanessa, the owner, was such a warm and fabulous hostess! The breakfast and dinner we had was truly incredible...such a feast. The entire property was beautifully decorated and such a relaxing place to stay. And the pool was amazing in the heat!"
 May 2015,5,The Ultimate Oasis,"We only spent one night here and we wish we could have stayed a week. Vanessa was a fantastic hostess, the other staff were friendly and always ready to assist with our every need. Room was gorgeous, food was amazing and having a glass of wine/ beer while enjoying the communal areas such as pool and lounge areas, was fabulous."
 April 2015,5,Excellent!,"We had a great time at this fantastic lodge! Great location, great place, great people, great food, great garden&swimming pool! Thank you Vanessa, Xavier and everyone at L'Ma Lodge for your hospitality!! We enjoyed very much our stay with you and hope to have the chance to repeat it soon!"
 November 2014,5,Oasis of calm with AMAZING home-cooked food,"L'Ma lodge is a true gem set in a tranquil corner of the Skoura oasis. The charming family who run the hotel live on site, above the common areas and are incredibly friendly and attentive, as are their lovely staff. Nothing is too much trouble and we loved spending our evenings playing scrabble next to their beautiful fire place, or flicking through their interiors coffee table books over a glass of wine. The common areas are stunningly decorated with vintage, upcycled furniture and comfy sofas and cushions sourced throughout Morocco and India (the owners are big travellers and also own a travel agency in town). The accommodation itself is set in a separate building, just a few steps away and our room was very tastefully and thoughtfully decorated with items from the local…"
 March 2015,5,What a find!,"We were looking for somewhere quiet and comfortable to relax on our return journey following a drive over the High Atlas and down to the desert ...... and we certainly found it. Vanessa and Xavier had the vision and the energy to create L'Ma Lodge, a wonderful oasis in the Palmerais of Skoura. When we first arrived we were straight away made to feel very welcome and throughout our stay Vanessa was on hand to ensure we had everything we needed and to give us tips on where to visit and where to shop etc. The simply furnished accommodation, set in beautiful grounds, was perfect for our needs, and the food, sourced mainly with local ingredients, was excellent. We would not hesitate to recommend L'Ma Lodge to anyone looking for accommodation in the region of Skoura."
 February 2015,5,Stayed at L'Ma Lodge whilst on a short tour of Morocco.,"We stayed at L'Ma Lodge in February 2015. The room we stayed in was beautiful, and a lighted fire in the dining area was much appreciated as the weather was cool in the evenings. The meals we had were excellent, and I was well catered for as a vegetarian. It was an excellent base for touring locally. Everyone made us very welcome."
 March 2015,5,This will take some knocking off the top spot in Skoura!,"L'Ma Lodge is personal, the product of a young couples thinking. The design is interesting, charming and a lovely take on a contemporary solution to experience Morocco in real comfort. Everything works and is generally nicely finished, this isn't always the case in Morocco! Allow enough time to find the Lodge, in daylight if possible. The track off the paved road isn't initially clear. (You may of course simply be distracted by the marvellous views ahead of you)! Lots to do and no end of local insight and recommendations from the wonderful team that delivers such a great experience. Modern Morocco done well."
 February 2015,5,Wonderful oasis,"hidden in the middle of the Palmerais but respecting and even protecting the ecosystem, l'ma lodge is an unexpected beautiful discovery. Vanessa and Xavier realized their own dream and made it available also for other people. The riad has an authentic and simple style, the luxus of the simple things. Rooms are generous, very confortable beds, clean. People and service are the cherry on the tagine.. ehm cake! Next time will stay longer!"
 February 2015,5,Relaxing stay in Skoura - a little paradise,"Such a beautiful place. The taste and thought that has been put in to the design of this riad is fascinating. The ambiance is so relaxing, no noise from traffic or the hustle and bustle of Moroccan life,and with views over the snowy Atlas mountains, this is a place where you can truly unwind. The food was brilliant, Moroccan but with a little European twist, with many home grown produce used. The owners are warm and welcoming, I would highly recommend this riad."
 January 2015,5,Great place to stay !,"This place is really nice. The cleanliness, the service, the location, the owner and personnel...the breakfast and the food in general are awesome ! We would absolutely recommend this establishment to anyone and would return easily. Skoura and area, the palmeraie, the region is very interesting, authentic and genuine. We did not see much tourists (granted we were there in low season). If you travel to Morocco, remember that there's much more to it than just Marrakech (which is nice to visit). Granted there are some tourist-traps, this is not one of them by any means. If you like simple and understated quality, the off the beaten track with a certain amount of comfort then...Go there and go now...:-)"
 December 2014,5,Wonderful stay at L'Ma,We wished we could have stayed more than one night at the gorgeous L’Ma Lodge. L’Ma is tucked in the oasis at Skoura – an oasis in itself. Great attention to detail – throughout the main house and the guestrooms. Truly a visual feast from interior décor to the gardens! Vanessa and Xavier have thought of everything and they are wonderful hosts. When we arrived Xavier was headed into town and was kind enough to let us follow him to a restaurant for lunch and Vanessa put us in touch with a contact to purchase carpets in Ouarzazate (this saved us time and no doubt money). Dinner was delightful and breakfast was the best we had in Morocco. So many jams and compotes to choose from and the coffee was exceptional. L’Ma is well worth a visit – just be sure to book for more than…
 December 2014,5,Excellent stay in beautiful Skoura,"Skoura is an excellent base for visiting the kasbah and oasis of the area, and L'ma Lodge is just perfect. When we arrived it was dark, and entering the lodge was like stepping into heaven after several hours of driving. The road to reach the lodge is a bit bumpy, but it is the small price to pay for being right into the palm groove. The room was large and nicely furnished. NB: there are radiators, so even in the middle of winter every space is very warm (and this is rare in Morocco!). The common spaces are extremely cozy and well designed, with nice pieces of antique furniture. In the middle of the dining area there is a big fireplace which adds a lot of atmosphere. Food was really good, and always different. We did not have the opportunity to spend time in the large garden…"
 December 2014,5,Well worth the detour,"Oh we wish we'd book ourselves for longer than just one night. L'Ma Lodge is so beautiful, extremely well kept and our hosts were very welcoming and caring. Both meals we had at L'Ma Lodge were made with the best organic/free range local products, absolutely delicious. We will be back."
 October 2014,5,A real jewel in the middle of the Palmeriae de Skoura,"We spent one night at L'Ma Lodge as part of a week round trip in southern Morocco. The place is just fabulous... we had one of the suites for our family of four and loved it. Room was spacious, clean and simply decorated with an incredible taste. Natural elegance without pretentiousness characterizes the all guest house: the garden, the common spaces, the swimming pool. To say it with the words of my son ... the place a soul and transmits a lot of positive energy.The hosts are charming and helpful. We felt welcome at any time in a very natural way. Staff very gentle and friendly. Food local but with a touch of refinement ... breakfast heart-warming (loved the almou and pomegranate home made jam) and dinner delicious. The palmeriae of Skoura enchanting ... just regret not to…"
 October 2014,5,Wonderful haven,"We absolutely loved staying at L'Ma Lodge. It's a beautifully run small hotel but it has something much more special than its comfort- Vanessa and Xavier treat their guests so warmly and with such a huge welcome that they made our stay memorable for their friendship as well as their exceptional hospitality. The rooms are lovely, the food delicious, the gardens beautifully lush and relaxing. But it's the people we'll come back for. Mark and Tessa Scantlebury London"
 October 2014,5,Breathtaking beauty; go to Skoura just for L'Ma,"We had SUCH a relaxing and fun time at L'Ma, I'd recommend GOING TO SKOURA JUST FOR L'MA... it's a BEAUTIFUL oasis of palms in which you'll find your palatial suite in the stone-hewn lodge. Every detail has been carefully designed with amazing African art and antiques tastefully lighting every turn, with elegant touches like the Boules courtyard and luxurious (and massive) lagoon swimming pool. We're planning to go back and hire the whole place out next time! ;)"
 October 2014,5,Like coming home to friends,"We stayed three nights at L'ma Lodge after a recommendation from a friend and it was the best hotel in a trip that was truly not short of highlights. The garden and house are huge with fantastic little nooks to sit and read, the food 100% homemade and very innovative (choice of 8 homemade marmelades for breakfast!), and most importantly Vanessa and Xavier made us instantly feel at home like old friends. Morocco is not short of beautiful hotels, but none managed to exude the charm, personality, friendliness and community spirit of this place. Formerly owner of a travel agency, Vanessa is incredibly knowledgable, she recommended and set up great day trips and set us up for the next memorable hotel at Agdz. There are enough quiet corners, but this is place for people who want to…"
