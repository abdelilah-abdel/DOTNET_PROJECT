 October 2022,4,Convenient location and good value,"Very good location between the train station and Hassan II mosque, just inside the medina. Nice, en-suite room with small balcony. Very nice and efficient reception staff. Tea making facilities provided. TV in room didn't work and steps felt a bit creaky. Overall, good value for Casablanca but lacked a bit of Moroccan character like the riads of other medinas.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2022,1,"Old, No Lift, No Air-condition and needs a Refurbish",As per my title the hotel is located on the edge of the old town and near to Casa Port but it also means that you have endless amount of local men sitting outside the hotel day and night drinking tea and coffee. The food around the hotel smells nice and even tastes nice but believe me you will be suffering after. Normally I am okay with street food but the street food there killed my stomach.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2022,5,Delightful hotel,"Maybe not the best hotel i have survived but it was a very nice hotel ı was happy . Two wonderful people, Saadia and Rachid always smile and helpful . The rooms are very clean, the view is beautiful and enjoyable. Belki de hayatta kaldığım en iyi otel değildi ama çok güzel bir oteldi, mutluydum. İki harika insan, Saadia ve Rachid her zaman gülümseyen ve yardim eden. Odalar çok temiz, manzara güzel ve keyifli.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2022,3,One night stay,"Great location, the lady at the front desk in the morning was very nice and helpful, sharing tips and info about the city, the other guy at night was nice, the room was good but honestly I didn't notice it had no AC, despite having a balcony which I kept opened the entire time I was sweating at night and I couldn't sleep after sunrise because of the light and the fact that had to close the door. I think during cooler days it would have been a much better experience",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2022,4,"We love it, but it’s basic.","We love the Hotel Central and stay every time we pass through Casablanca. It’s really well located near the Port, and Casa Port train station (for trains to the airport, Rabat, etc). Everyone is extremely friendly and there’s a lovely (unkept) roof terrace for morning coffees and evening drinks. There’s a large variety of rooms - singles to four bed rooms, some have terraces and look out onto the lively square below. It could be cleaner and the standard could be higher, but it’s extremely charming and very much worth the price (roughly £30 per night at time of writing).",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2021,5,Hotel With Charm and Best in This Category,"I book budget hotels only after looking at many reviews. I read positive and many negative comments about Hotel Central but something told me take a chance. After a short walk from Gare d' Port railway station, I'm glad I did. From the moment I walked in, the receptionist was exceedingly friendly & helpful. My room, up three flights of stairs, was larger than expected with a clean, comfortable bed, lots of storage space, a small desk and even a balcony. The toilet / shower was a bit dated and cramped for space,, but everything was thoroughly clean. A great nights' sleep followed. Yes, the hotel has seen better days but the current management and staff work had to keep this a clean, quiet, safe property .. and based on all of these factors for me it deserves a high rating.…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2020,2,Faded glory. Not great at all.,The location is great but my friend and I are disappointed with our stay. We’re on the third floor in a double room. Things are not that clean and the internet connection is unreliable. The inside of the bathroom door is dirty and there’s a big hole in the ceiling in the hallway. We’re thoroughly unimpressed and happy we’re only staying here for one night.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,2,good location and that's it.,"Staff was friendly, location was good, 8 mins walk to and from Casa Port, which we needed for our airport transfer in the morning. And that's where the positives end. I understand that this in not a luxury hotel, however there's no excuse for the dirty bathroom, used soap on the sink and the piece of dirty plastic piping in the bed. Literally inside the sheets. I slept with my clothing on.... The room smelled, it was just sad... Spend a little extra and stay somewhere else.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,2,"Location was ok, not many other positives","Location was ok, although the current road works going on, made it a chore to reach. Was not up to expectation, expected a comfortable room with at least a fan (no AC), and clean bathroom and basic amenities, this was not the case. Pricey does not match the actual hotel",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,4,Amazing staff/Rachid,"I had a wonderful stay at hotel Central. I enjoyed my room, but more importantly I enjoyed the staff. The hotel is sufficient for the price and clean. The location is also great as you can reach to many important spots in the city. With a few touches and fixing this hotel could be one of the hottest spot for budget traveller. The first day I was welcomed by Sadia who was kind enough to let me choose between three rooms and change my mind in between. Rachid is the evening and night receptionist. He is one of the most wonderful people I had ever met in Morocco. Rachid would help me to contact my tour guides and make sure I get a taxi to get from one place to the other. I lost my phone in Casablanca and Rachid helped my to search for it and even to buy a new cel. I almost gave…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,3,Small budget hotel in a convenient location; Petit hôtel économique bien situé,"This is a very small hotel for the student and budget traveller. I liked the close location to the Casa Port train station that takes you to the main station for the airport or other cities. The guy at reception was helpful and assisted with questions and directions. There are local shops and takeaway shops in the vicinity of the hotel. The old medina is also not too far. The room was very small. There is no fridge or water in the room. There was no gel, soap or shampoo in the bathroom. The Wifi was not working when I arrived and was fixed late into the evening.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,5,Perfect little stay,"Wonderful location, amazing staff, perfect little hotel for a Moroccan stay and feel! We loved the large open window and view over the busy square and port. 20 min walk to Hassan Mosque, with an amazing view of it in the evening from the rooftop patio! Great stay!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,4,Good value if you get a room on the front,"Good location near Casa Port and walkable to the Medina and Hassan II Mosque There is a big difference in the rooms, the rooms on the front are bright and airy with some colonial features and views over the square. However the rooms at the back are dark and dingy. No lift so pick a lower floor if that is an issue Free WIFI works well Go to the roof terrace for some good views",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,2,Dirty and noisy,"With only one night in Casablanca (already too long in this city..) , the hotel is in a decent location. However it is close to a large industrial port which, along with a lot of street activity, made for a noisy location. The main point though is that it was simply unclean, with hairs on bedding and surfaces not wiped down in the bathroom. I would not stay again.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,3,Classic essential,"The location is quite good.near the train station,near the mosque and you will feel the vibes of good old place.. it is clean and they provide you only the essential which is good.the receptionist was very helpful and accommodating to all our questions.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,3,Moroccan Style Hotel,"The hotel is conveniently located near the Casa Port Train Station which one can take to access the airport which is very convenient and saves money on having to take a taxi otherwise. The hotel is on the outskirts of the Medina and right in front of the hotel are eateries, coffee shop and banks to get cash. The room itself is pretty tight but spacious enough. The biggest issue at the hotel are the paper thin walls. You can hear guests throughout the hotel talking and their doors closing. So, if you are a particularly light sleeper you may have issues with getting a good night's sleep. Overall, the hotel is solid and as expected given the price range.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,5,"Charming, clean, central",Very surprising find in Morocco. Very clean room with added amenities like soap and shampoo. Extra towels were given to us without a problem. Very nice girl at receptions who even helped us print our boarding passes and gave us a great lunch recommendation nearby. Highly recommend this centrally located hotel.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,3,"Friendly staff, convenient location","A friend and I, two women in their early 60's, stayed at Hotel Central on our arrival to Morocco and again, before our departure, four weeks later. Somewhere it says that Hotel Central is in the heart of the medina, in fact it is on the very edge, but, it is a very convenient location. From the airport, we caught the train to Casa Port. From Casa Port, it is a 5 minute walk to the hotel. One of the staff, very kindly, walked me to Casa Port the night of my departure. The staff was equally helpful in carrying our luggage up and down the stairs for us. The hotel is a great base for exploring that part of the city. We walked to the mosque (take the tour, fabulous!), Rick's Cafe (not worth the time), then a taxi further along the shore. Of course, the medina is right behind the…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,4,AMAZING staff in a quaint colonial-style simple hotel...,"This hotel will not be anyone's cup of tea, but I LOVED it... Rooms: Bare bones, a bed, a table, a chair, a bathroom with hot water in the shower but only cold water in the sink. If you're really lucky: A balcony with chair and table overlooking the square in front of the hotel and with sea view. This might sound less than appealing but I LOVED the room. I slept 11 hours in the wonderful bed and loved writing on the computer looking over the square. Heating/ A/C: There is no A/C but I was here in November and my problem was that the room was getting too cold. But the hotel DOES HAVE space heaters, so if you have that problem.... ask for one. WiFi: Suffered from occasional interruptions but FAST! Other: There is no elevator (not suitable for those with mobility…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,5,Basic clean rooms and some of the nicest staff you could ever hope for,"The price was right for the triple room we booked. Nice and quiet (in the late evening) with a cute balcony that faced the square. The front hotel staff were exceptionally kind and the breakfast food was plentiful and simple. The bed was very comfortable which was an added bonus after a long flight. Minutes away from Hassan II mosque and walking distance to the tourist area. Located in the medina but right near the edge where it wasn't chaotic. All in all, a decent clean place for very little money.,",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,3,Quite expensive for its quality,"It's an old and charming hotel but quite expensive. Located inside the medina but strange people usually roam around the park in front of it. Very knowledgeable but not-that-cheery reception guy. The bed was hard, local channels were the only available on the TV, old bathro and toilet but we had a great view on our corner room. Sunset-viewing at the roofdeck was lovely. A so-so hotel and we will definitely look for other alternatives on our next trip.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2018,3,I would stay here again on my future solo trip.,I stayed one night here. The room was nice and comfortable size for a solo traveller (eventhough the room occupancy are for two) but the shower was just average for me. Most of the staff were helpful and friendly :),Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2018,5,The best budget hotel with natural breeze,We checked in for two nights 5/9/18 - 7/9/18 and got our room at 3rd floor. We were given the sea view and left the window-door open to let the wind breeze to flow in. I had the best sleep of my life. Room 325 is perfect!!,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2018,4,Stay at hotel Central,"Getting to the hotel, we were told was not a good place. I can say that we were pleasantly surprised, the hotel, was a great one to finish my Morocco holiday. Everything worked. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. Had a great night sleep. The roof garden gave us a great view of the city and port. The hotel, was close to the bazaar as well, which was very welcome. The famous Rick's cafe ( from the movie Casablanca), was not far and we had the opportunity to see it. Breakfast, was great. The stuff, was very professional and kind. They were very helpful. A very happy stay.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2018,3,A well located hotel in the heart of the Medina in Casablanca,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Hotel Central for 2 nights. Whilst we were impressed with the value for money, quality of breakfast and location, we were a little disappointed with the room we were given for the first night. We were however moved afterwards and had a nice stay for our second night. We recommend that if you are staying try and check in early to get a court yard view room or email ahead. As some of the interior rooms are small and stuffy.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2018,3,Average for one night stop,"Good accommodation, nice crew. Stayed for one night waiting for our flight. The room is fine, clean bed, average toilet. Some rooms have a front view which is nice, the others have a back view which are not aired very well. The roof is small and not very organized. The breakfast is really good and has varieties on the contrary to many hotels in Morocco.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,3,"Decent Hotel, Nice Breakfast","This hotel is located on the corner of the Medina, and a walking distance from Casa Port train station (10min or so walk). We found it quite easily and checked in. The staff were nice enough and showed us to our room which was on the third floor. One important thing to note is there are no elevators in this hotel so we had to carry our luggage up and down those flights of stairs. The room itself was small but comfy enough. Our room faced the square and there is a cafe just below so it was quite noisy even until about 11pm so we had to close the shutters. The bathroom was very small and got a little cold and moist as the shower water sprays out, and there wasn't any ventilation fans inside. Breakfast was nice as the cafe next door provides the food. Mint tea was provided and a…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2018,5,Amazing hospitality,"The staff there was extremely kind, made my stay that much better. Room was decorated in a gorgeous morocon theme, also very affordable and the location is very cetntral. Can easily walk to train station/mall (10 minute walk) a huge market is a 5 minute walk as well!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,5,Great stay with amazing staff/owner,We stayed with a group of (10) friends at Hotel Central during Ramadan in Casablanca. As you can imagine you have to improvise during Ramadan if you want to get some activities done! The owner Jamal was more than willing to call his contacts/friends and organize some fun activities to do. He really made our trip. Rooms are clean and fine! breakfast good for a small price and location is great.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,3,nice location and friendly staff,"Although the room was small, it was nice and airy due to the balcony. We only had a short stay before flying out, but the hotel is within walking distance to the Casa Port train station that services the airport and Casa Port can be reached by connecting trains at the Casa Voyages station from/for other destinations. The staff was very kind and helpful with suggestions on restaurants. This is a nice stay for a short visit. The hotel only accepts cash if you're paying on arrival but there is an ATM in the square if needed.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,4,Excellent Hostel!,"Excellent hostel with great people. Room and bathroom are small but still fine. Worth to stay here for the night. Well situated s well. If you wish to stay here for few day, I definitely recommend to stay here and visit the Mosque only 1.6km from the hostel.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2018,5,great place and stuff,"great location close to tram station, in medina, quiet, friendly stuff, very helpful. loved it would stay again and would recommend. The only problem - no hot water during the day, only in the morning, but i didnt bother to ask why.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,3,One night only,"We went to this hotel fully aware of what to expect after reading all the reviews. And because of that, we were not overly disappointed. We wanted a place with easy access to the Grand mosque, and where it's not going to cost us a bomb. There for less than 24 hours, just a short stop between cities. Okay for the price we paid.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2018,4,good hotel for short stay,"The hotel is good for a short stay in Casablanca. It is close to Hassan II mosque which is the only thing worth seeing in Casablanca. Rooms are big and comfortable and bathrooms are clean and good. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was not good, you are not given any options. It is a fixed breakfast that did not have a variety of things. Coffee was no good!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,5,Warm welcome,"We rented two rooms in Hotel Central and in comparison with the higher prices for bigger hotel chains it’s a very decent option. There was warm water, fast wi-fi and our rooms and bathrooms were cleaned. The staff is kind, and there’s a rooftop terrace which is quite nice. I only wish breakfast was included, but nonetheless a pleasant and not pretentious stay! Oh yes, and they filmed an advert for the national football team just in front of the hotel!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,4,Very good,"Great location, it is in the center of the city and easy to access most of the big locations in Casablanca. The room is good and also the bathroom is ok. I think its most important feature here is the location.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2018,1,5 day booking... didn’t manage 5 hours,"Choose this hotel due to some reasonable reviews and the fact we wanted to try traditional and not a fancy swanky hotel. Some of the reviews did worry us but we thought it could not be that bad.... how wrong. Arrived late afternoon to be greeted by a cheerful guy... he looked at the booking and stated because we were staying for 5 nights we would have a good room. Room was on the third floor so we lugged our bags to the room and opened the door to a cold damp smelling room, with on double bed and one single a small table and a bathroom... we then checked out the bathroom to find it not very clean. In good old British fashion we decided not to complain but to do something about it and went out about some cleaning materials and some extra loo roll. We returned to the room and…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,3,Please change the bedsheet,"This hotel is good for a short stay. It is very close to the Train station and you can walk to Hassan II mosque. The room was basic, the floor wasn't properly mopped and the bedsheets were not clean. You can tell they did not change the bedsheets. It could be difficult to move your luggage upstairs as the staircase is winding. Delicious continental breakfast was served in a big dining hall.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2018,5,"Free upgrade, wonderful host.","We spent 7 nights in Marrakech and decided to take a train to Casablanca. The fare is 90 dirhams each way and there is a train every 2 hours. It’s a 3 hr 40 minute journey This hotel is the perfect location for a 2 day tour of Casablanca (you really don’t need more than this). Can I mention that this hotel actually has *working* and FAST WiFi all over the hotel, including our room which was up on the third floor?! We stayed at a 5* Resort whilst in Marrakech which claims to have WiFi but it only worked when standing awkwardly in the lobby. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the centre. Along the way you’ll pass dozens of stores that sell good quality branded handbags etc. Locals are extremely friendly and they *all* warned us to keep our phones out of sight when walking through…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2018,3,Good for a couple of nights,"This guesthouse is not the best one but good enough for a couples of nights. Rooms are quite old and showers too small but that’s not a biggie at all. It was close to train station (Casa Port), Hassan II Mosque and the centre ( United Nations square) and the price was good enough. Recommended for those who are looking for an affordable place to sleep and have breakfast included.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,1,Please Do Not Go Here.,"This is my first review ever. Please do not go here. What a nightmare. I felt like someone was pranking me based on how horrible the service was at Hotel Central. I booked a room for a night and paid a deposit. When we arrived, Abdul, the man at the front desk, informed us that he gave away our room to somebody else. He didn't take responsibility for his inexcusable actions and it was scary to see someone be so insensitive. Such a terrible experience and I would never recommend this place to anyone.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,4,Good place,"We got a free upgrade to the familyroom with 3 single beds and in a separate room with a queensized bed. Very friendly people. The breakfast was good, there is a playground 500 m away in the direction of Hassan Mosque, which is in walking distance.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,3,Bogart wasn't here!,"No, of course ""Casablanca"" wasn't filmed here but it carries a time-warp to the early 20th century. The building has seen better days but in a place without a big choice of budget hotels, it's not bad. In fact the winding staircase (minus lift/elevator) is one of its best points. The rooms are a bit basic and the service on the slapdash side but the setting is in a pleasant if somewhat run-down square in the medina (the youth hostel is here too) with an assortment of eccentric locals. They serve continental breakfast, with a backing of pop music. Most of it is indifferent but I was treated to Santana's version of ""She's not there""! If you're lucky you may get a room overlooking the Atlantic.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,2,Nothing to like,"The hotel looks old. I didn't feel like welcome when I was check-in. And I was put in a room on fourth floor, and by the way there's no elevator, just had to walk up the stairs with my luggage. To my surprise, the room was actually on the roof-top, which I got a feeling like it was a make-shift room. And when I came back at night, there was no light on that floor, which made it very difficult to unlock my room in the dark. Room was also small and didn't look as good as in the pictures. Glad I stayed only for one night.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,4,Good budget hotel,If you are looking for an afforable and comfy hotel i will suggest Central Hotel. Its located in the old part of the city with plenty of restaurants around. Rooms are a bit old but its a good option for this money Breakfast is very good,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,3,It has its charms.,"If you are all about being in the heart of local life, then this is the place for you. I think the real charm of this place is that it doesn't pretend to be anything but authentically local. That and the very energetic, funny owner/receptionist (not sure, really) makes up for what this hotel lacks: ample room size and amenities. But for its price, I have no complaints. Beware: there is no lift in this hotel, so if you have a big luggage like me, be happy that the staff is willing to help you bring it to your room. I enjoyed their breakfast (although it's the same every day). The croissant is baked to perfection and the coffee is really good. Our first experience of the medina was here. It prepared us very well for the bedlam that is Marrakech. Met a very friendly old gentleman…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,4,Good location,"The hotel is older and yes there are a lot of stairs...our room was very clean, the hallways were as well. The breakfast included was good, a typical Moroccan breakfast of breads, egg, OJ and coffee or tea. The location was great, 5 minutes from Casa Port - one of the main train hubs in Casa, easy to walk to the Mosque and to one of the downtown areas as well as close by the Medina. The only downside would be the hotel reception - they were not your typical front desk people - but that's ok for independent travellers. The rooms are not totally soundproof either. I would stay here again for the convenient location, and the price was pretty good for a large city and it did include breakfast.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,2,My wardrobe feom home is bigger than the bathroom we had in this hotel!,"We booked 7 nights here, but after 2 nights we leaved this place! we got a small room with very small bathroom. This place has a huge potential and could be perfect if they will invest more money and after that put the room more expensive.The terrace above is nice, with view to the mosque and the ocean. The hotel is well placed, 5 minutes from casa port and 20 from hassan mosque.The breakfast was ok. In front of the hotel is a park, with 'strange' people. Noisy place, you can hear everything from outside, but also the customers made noise.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,3,Does the job,"A decent hotel but I wouldn't recommend for families due to the noise from the many little cafes around until very late at night and the window shutters don't keep the sound out. There is also no air conditioning provided. The location is very good though and the rooms spacious with a decent shower(we've struggled to get a decent shower with hot water whilst travelling so this was most welcome). The guy on the reception desk cracks jokes after every other word, which is amusing. The rooms could do with a good moping though as you only has to walk around a bit in bare feet and they were black and gritty. The breakfast was nice and quickly served with a choice of mint tea/coffee with an egg, large croissant, crusty bread, butter, jam and spreadable cheese.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,2,Two Night Stay - Hot Room,"Stayed here two nights and during the day the room got hot; no air conditioning. Fortunately I was in a corner room and got some cross ventilation. One of the front desk staffers is rude and he thinks it is funny. In a good location with restaurants and a grocery store close by. One of the nearby Mosques starts Adhan (Islamic Call to Worship) very loudly which may offend some but I found it pleasant, even at 6AM.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,2,bad experience,"It is difficult to find a good and budget hotel in Casablanca that is why we had to chose this one. They don't care about their reputation and it is ok for them to cheat their clients. We had a reservation for two nights - first and last day of our trip. First day it was ok although our rooms didn't correspond our reservation and they were humid. But last day when we arrived late in the evening we were said that they didn't have any rooms for us! Although we had a printed reservation. Administrator didn't care any replacement, he just proposed us to go to the youth hostel nearby but I knew they had bugs in this hostel. Finally we decided to go to Irbis but Hotel Central it is awful experience.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,4,Nice hotel Good value for money,"We stay two nights at the hotel Central. Obviously for this price you can't expect a four star hotel room but it's a nice hotel, well situated in the old part of Casa near some good restaurant and near the Casa Port station accessible directly from the airport). The staff was nice and really helpful. I will definitely go there again.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,3,Average Hotel a Walk from Casa Port,"Charming hotel close to Casa Port -convenient location, not so far from Hassan 2 Mosque. We got a room on the third floor with a beautiful view. The hotel could be better maintained but the staff was friendly. Some sketchy people in the area but they didn't bothered us at all. Breakfast was good! If you are a picky traveler, don't stay there. Nothing really wow to see in Casablanca except the Grand Mosque H2.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,3,Good location,"Good location though its very basic for its price offered.I really love the interior decorations of the hotel.However, beds are not so comfortable,the covered is falling apart and most of the 3 rooms we used all the locks is not very friendly 😂(you will see when you experience Moroccan door) Other than that good stay for couple of nights.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,3,Budget accommodation good for short stay,"Hotel walking distance to railway station, it is a traditional old decorate building without lift. Boss is very funny, nice and gentleman, he help us move luggage to 1st floor bedroom by a long ladder. Twin bedroom size is small, no air-condition and ventilation not good, a small window without window frame, old furniture and not sufficient amenities inside bedroom, bedding is not clean enough, shower room very small and narrow, toilet flushing with small leaking. Dining room decorate special with friendly staff and also the breakfast is doing very tasty.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,3,Basic but good,"7 minutes walk from Casa Port station. Google map shows two Hotel Central the farther one is the wrong one. I tried to email them for the address clarification but I got no reply. Rooms are small but okay for the price. They put me in a room on the roof top, so I had to carry my luggage up to the 4th floor. If this is an issue for you, look for another hotel. Beddings are okay, only that the headboard is falling over. Breakfast is usual. Some guest were served eggs, some were not. Nevertheless, these are small issues after a 17-hour flight. If you are only transiting Casablanca and not sensitive to above issues, the hotel is for you.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,4,Awesome Two Nights,"My stay in Casa as been good so far,Hotel Central has welcome me as expected!with the Taxi I used from the airport (30€ maximum plz)it wasnt easy finding the hotel because a lot of people dont know it but its really in the heart of “Ancienne Medina)its a lovely place good for travellers on budget...Very clean 👌🏾quiet and the breakfast is worth the price A place to recommend",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,3,Very basic but at the same time very very colonial place,"Basic place to stay with decent (small) rooms (no air con). Wifi works great. Rooms are not too big with no good view (unless port windows). Breakfast is decent. The place is not super clean although not dirty and room service works every day. The staff varies and the approach depends on the day? - one day they are very impolite and on another, smiling and polite. However, our impression was they do not want to be very hospitable. There isn't any parking close to the hotel (although in description on many sites there is mention a parking is on site - it is not true). Public parking is at main street, some 200 meters from the hotel. And there is a fee for this parking. The place itself is not very comfortable however it has a great charm of old colonial building.

 September 2017,5,Nice little hotel,I stayed here for a couple of days in the 2nd week of September. The gentleman at the front desk was very nice. We were able to converse with him in English and Spanish. He even called a local hammam for us to figure out times & payment methods. The hotel is on the older side but it's very clean. We have a balcony with a nice view of the plaza. It's within walking distance of many interesting spots and local transport. The breeze comes in nicely & there was no need for an air conditioner. As with all old things there were a few smells here and there that indicated perhaps not all is well with the plumbing. Actually I can't really tell if it's coming in from the inside or the outside. In any case it comes and goes. The breakfast was very nice & the coffee was delicious. It's not…,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,4,Great 2 Night Stay,"Has everything you need for a cheap hotel, including an awesome breakfast! My room had a fantastic Wifi connection which wasn't easy to find in Morocco. Central location to tourist attractions. I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to see. Only downside to this hotel was my room was a little dark but it wasn't a problem for me as I was only in the room when I needed to sleep.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,3,Classic building. Basic facilities.,"Gorgeous old classic building and not a bad place to crash for the night if you are looking for something simple and no frills down by the port. It's nothing fancy but has a charm of its own. No AC, so make sure to get a room facing the square out front, or the back side if you want quiet.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2017,3,Casablanca for one night,"This being our first trip to Morocco and having had some problems getting a taxi from the airport in the early hours we found the person waiting for us at this old hotel very welcoming, gave us the wifi password, the keys to our rooms and breakfast time and bid us good night. The hotel needs some tlc but overall it was ok. Breakfast was ok with a choice of tea, coffee or mint tea with orange juice, croissants, eggs yoghurt, butter and jam. The hotel area is rundown but some renovation is taking place.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,4,Good for a short stay!,"I really liked this place! It's certainly not a luxury or boutique hotel, but the staff was very nice and the room was perfectly comfortable and clean. Location is great, can walk from the train station, and it's in the 'medina' which is a pretty good location to things in Casablanca as a tourist. On that note, my rating of Casablanca as a CITY is about a 2 of 10 (just dont go) but that's another story.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,5,Wonderfully atmospheric; great location; watch the world go by,"Absolutely loved the old-fashioned feel of this place. As soon as I walked into the room and saw the balcony and the square from the 3 huge windows, I imagined Albert Camus bashing out 'L'Etranger here, with a cigarette clamped between his teeth - and yes, I know that was Algeria, but still). We had a corner room with 3 huge windows & 2 balconies, one with table and chairs overlooking the square. The square is small and quiet but teeming with local life: you quickly recognise and meet local characters, like the grizzled old guy who sits on the corner, taking care of the square's cats while selling individual cigarettes to passers-by. I went to talk to him and he was lovely, even spread out 2 bits of cardboard for me to sit on! It's a very easy 10-min walk along the coast…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

In addition the view from the terrace at the top is amazing!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,1,"Horrible, avoid this place","2 positive points : quite clean and big breakfast BUT: awful location which is dodgy at night, staff was horrible and not willing to help (we had no warm water, the answer was a simple ""impossible""). When we left we had to pay a weird ""tax"" in cash even though we prepaid the booking on internet. Morever the room was noisy and we could hear every single word of people chat in the street. i will never come back.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2016,4,Decent accommodation,"The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. Breakfast is also provided here and the breakfast was very nice. Also it is located in a good place, it is close to a market, mosque and beach. It is satisfying.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,3,A convenient stop over,Stayed for 1 night before moving on from Casablanca. The Hotel is well placed near the train station and a walk to the Mosque. The hotel was as expected for the price. Gentleman on reception was very helpful and friendly.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,3,Decent accommodations,"Fine for the price. No lift, but if possible for you to access the roof at the top floor, i recommend requesting to stay there. WiFi is less reliable in the rooms & I sat at the couch on the 1st floor landing for a stronger signal. Slight smell from the toilet plumbing in the room closet to the stairs on the 4th floor (rm 432?). Decent location, in the heart of the old city.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,3,ok,A good place to lay your head while killing time in Casablanca. The management was very nice and easy going too. It's within a 10 minute walk to Casa Port train station. This place is a bargain compared to others in the area.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2017,5,Great hotel for great price,"Cute little hotel overlooking the port and beautiful water. Clean rooms, hot showers, delicious breakfast. Service was super friendly, the area is safe, and location is right next to the train station. No heater (as is commonplace in Morocco), but closing the windows and sleeping under the covers kept me nice and warm. Would recommend this to anyone staying in Casablanca!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,3,"Close to the center, but a bit noisy","The hotel was very closed to the center and the train station. Also close to most of attractions. But the room was really noisy as other guests were screaming loudly and it was not controlled by the staffs. And you can hear the sound of bathrooms from next doors. The receptionist was really friendly and nice. But one of the kitchen staffs who served breakfast was very rude, and I was offended. The breakfast was not bad though. The hotel decoration was moroccan style, pretty.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2017,4,Great location to walk to major places,"Although this is an older hotel, it is very charming, iron balconies look out at the plaza (which can be a little noisy at night but I found it a wonderful way to see the locals and their activities). The men who run the hotel are very charming! Free breakfast, and the best part--it was an easy walk from the Casa Port railway station. It is located within the walls of the medina, an experience not to be missed in Morocco. You can walk to the best restaurant, Sqala, which treats you like an honored guest. You can also walk to the only mosque a non-Muslim can visit--the Hassan II Mosque which is a magnificent architectural wonder.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,Very Convenient Budget Hotel,"Pros -Rooms: clean, working showers, very comfy beds -Location: near the train station, Hassan II mosque, Rick's cafe, the medina, trams, cafes, restaurants, and beach -Funny, polite, and helpful manager -Very good breakfast in a well kept cafe within the hotel -Safe: No issues as a female traveler. Cons -No elevator. Pack lightly if possible. -If you're not familiar with Morocco things can be a bit harder to find I stayed here with female friends while I was studying abroad in Morocco. Casablanca was one of the last cities we saw before leaving. We really liked the hotel. With the hotel being in such a good location and having breakfast included, we saved quite a few dirhams by staying there and were able to see everything we wanted. The hotel manager was very welcoming and…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,4,Value for money,"It's an old hotel conveniently located close to all attractions right next to the old Medina. My first night was a nightmare, they gave me an unclean room on the 3rd floor with broken lights and a broken toilet seat. Then next day after I speak to the manager they changed my room to a really nice one on the 1st floor with a balcony. They also changed sheets and cleaned the room right in front of me. Key is to talk to staff and management nicely to get what you need. Moroccan people respond very positively if you're nice. Customer service was great. This hotel is run by 2 brothers, they look so identical I thought they're twins. They gave me very helpful clear instructions and tips to enjoy my stay in Casablanca. There was a small tv with cable channels in the room, however I…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,2,Meh,"The upsides to this small not so great hotel are that it is relatively cute and charming and located walking distance to markets, restaurants and Rick's Cafe. While this hotel is central it seems the taxis do not know where it is. The wi-fi strength is low at best and breakfast is basically bread with coffee and maybe a not so good hardboiled egg. Additionally, if you like taking warm to hot showers, forget it. Hot water is a scarce if not absent resource here. I ended up taking a shower at the nearby Hyatt where a friend was staying. I would not recommend this hotel. ALSO make sure to ask the taxis to put on their meters...they should not charge more than 10 to 15 Dirhams to get around. If they do they are ripping you off.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,4,Just what i wanted,"I already reviewed this, french quarters, the manager and my waiter, were excellent, wasn't just a tourist. Had my local kiff and left the rest as a tip to my waiter, would bring me out a coffee into the street square. Meanwhile the usual Japanise, Chinese tourists were oblivious other than they said they had been there and took a picture. These guys knew I was a serious seeker of life.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2017,2,Dank!,It was a cold rainy winter day when I arrived. Room was cold and dank. Bed felt humid and cold. I managed to get more blankets and manged to keep warm. A little smelly of mould. I originally thought I'd stay 2 nights but checked out the next day for something warmer. I met a few other travellers there which was nice. I wouldn't stay there again.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,4,An Ideal tourist Budget hotel,"Stayed at Hotel Central in Ancienne Medina within a short walking distance from Casa Port railway station and most popular shopping area. There is a direct convenient train from Casablanca airport. It is a pretty old hotel without a lift, but thanks to the owner who carried my luggage to my room and brought it down on the day of checkout. Fix breakfast but good portion of spread will fill your stomach, nothing fancy. Very cheap accommodation costing less than fifty dollars, but without any frills. Good for night stays for both young and olds, solo and family travelers. Walk comfortably to ‘Rick Café’ and the Hassan II Mosque within 10 to 20 minutes.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,3,Close to Everything,"Facing the marina at the gates of the Medina, Hotel Central is close to the downtown area as well as a 15 minute walk to the Hassan II Mosque. It is an overall good value as most accommodations are overpriced in Casablanca. If coming from the Marrakesh, you will need to take a taxi here (don't pay more then 20 dihram, they will ask as high as 70!). The taxi will drop you at the bottom of the Medina and Hotel Central is directly in front of you up the drive. It is blue and white and can't miss it. Be sure to bring earplugs as the square in front is a bit noisy and the traffic off the main street can be loud. The room is simple but nice with plenty of hot water, a window that opens to a small balcony, and is clean. Breakfast is good too and included in the room cost-- yogurt,…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,4,More than what you pay for,"For a shorter stay this hotel is located close to the old city, the harbor, the train station, and many eating options. Perhaps even more important, the helpfulness of the staff, particularly making phone calls and furnishings other information made our Morocco landing smooth. The beds were fine and the bathrooms adequate but no hot water.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,4,Good budget option. C'est Bon,Good budget option. Hotel Manager is great! Hot Water is great and does not take forever. Do not use the directions provided. This hotel is so easy to find. You walk out the fron door of the train station and cross the road. Turn right (west) - walk about two hundred meters and a small street leads slightly uphill to a square on the edge of the medina. The hotel is right there. The Trip advisor or google map directions I was getting were ridiculous. If you are not there in 8 minutes walk from the train station - you are lost,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,3,Simple and pratical,"The rooms are spacious, the reception is very friendly and very helpful. The beds although were comfortable. There were only bath towels and no face towels. The WiFi was patchy. Breakfast decent, but they served margarine and the juice 50% natural, 50% concentrate.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,5,Perfect location for a budget stay,The manager of the hotel is friendly. Funny also. The rooms are kind of large. Basic shower but clean. No internal cafe but internal door to neighboring cafe. Around €35 in November. Central location.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2016,2,Meh!,"We booked this hotel as we wanted a place to sleep only for one night (we were just passing through Casablanca). It was ok but we wouldn't have stayed more than one night. Reception is poorly managed, the person at reception is mostly on their cellphone, they gave us the wrong visiting time for the mosque, they're generally not very helpful. The room and bathroom were not the cleanest, use your flipflops in the shower and bring soap to wash your hands. The only thing that surprised us was breakfast which was brought to our table in a timely manner and was generally satisfying. Also, location was good.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,3,Even Locals Told Me to Be Careful,"Not recommended for lone female travellers or small group of female travellers. As per previous reviews, the hotel is located at a shabby district. Many locals told me to be careful at night and practise extra caution. There is ""night life"" at the area till about midnight so you won't be able to sleep. Most of the reviews are true but no one mentioned that there is no door handles on the door and you basically have to master pushing and pulling the door to enter your room. Additionally, I could smell urine smell from the streets from my 2nd floor bedroom. Cheap and good for one night but seriously, not advisable for lone female travellers.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,5,Ocean View Balcony,"The hotel is less than 10 minutes walk from train station, walking distance to the mosque, in a little square with no traffic, with several little restaurants close by. It's an old colonial style building, in a good shape, white walls with blue paint woodworks, has its old charm and feels very relaxing. The rooms must have been refurbished, looks new, and very clean, confertable bed. Some third floor rooms have balcony with table and chairs, over looking the port. It was just too nice I actually stayed an extra night. The reception was very friendly and helpful, offered a local map marked all the sights around, and, he was actually very fun to play with, hahah, hope you can have more people take shifts and take more free time off :D",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,3,Pretty hotel and cheap,"For the price it was pretty much what I expected, i.e. basic rooms, the building itself is really pretty and the roof terrace has amazing views across the city. The hotels location is good, but I was warned by someone living in Casablanca that the area is a little unsafe after dark, so maybe don't carry too much cash etc. The service was patchy. There were two people on reception when I was there. One was incredibly helpful and friendly and the other...well...lets say not so much.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2016,2,Good location for one night stay,"Me and my partner stayed here in june 2015. Good location with a short walking distance from the train station (no need for a taxi). Beautiful interior at first sight but dirty at a closer look (especially bathroom). Bed linen and towels were clean tho. It will do for one night or two when on a budget. We only left our bags there and were out until late evening and then moved on to the next town after an early breakfurst. A good nights sleep with the low-key bustle outside. Excentric staff, we had difficulties understanding if the man in the reception were ironic or not but he were never rude and were quite entertaining. Only had breakfurst and it was simple yet more than we had hoped for (including freshly squeezed juice and home baked bread). If you just need a bed for…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,3,Good value for money and convenient location,"The location is in the medina, which is very close to the Casa Port train station and CTM bus station. The Hassan mosque is also within walking distance. The hotel is old and the bed is too soft. But the price is good for budget traveler.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2016,3,cheap and okay,As students this is in our price range. The rooms are simple and equipped with all necessities (bar hand soap). The first room we were placed in had a sagging mattress on one side which was uncomfortable to sleep on. Luckily we moved to a more comfortable room once we had complained to the reception. The showers are basic at best with the shower head pointing directly OUT of the shower. Overall nice and clean with a substantial free breakfast included!,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2016,1,Denied stay,"I booked the Hotel for me (European) and my Tunisian boyfriend. When we arrived the man in the reception was very aggressive and didn't let us check in since we're not married. In Moroccan law you can't book a hotel as a Moroccan unmarried couple. We explained that we're tourists and not Moroccan citizens, but we were still denied. The receptionist said we couldn't rent a room together because my boyfriend is Arab.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2016,4,Exactly what we needed!,Nothing too snazzy but perfect if you are travelling through. Clean rooms with lovely views over the port. Fanatic terrace and friendly helpful staff. Good breakfast and location. If you are looking for a no fuss place to stay then this is perfect.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2016,4,A nice hostel with friendly staff,"We stayed at this hostel for a few nights and the receptionist was very friendly and helpful, which made our stay pleasant. The facilities are quite basic and somewhat worn down so not suitable for anyone that is looking for a hotel rather than a hostel. No air conditioning in the rooms was a big minus in the August heat.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2016,3,One night stand,"Good location ( near railway station, down town and the Hassan ll Mosque) . Room a little too Spartan but clean .Manager and some of the crew a little too ""funny"" ( some more respect would be very welcome). Ok for (just) one night.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2016,3,Very basic but great if you just need a place for a night,"The overall experience was fine - the beds are good, there's a nice roof terrace and there's breakfast. However, if you're looking for a bit of luxury then this is not the place for you. If you're just staying in Casablanca for a night or two and are on a budget, this place is sufficient. Location-wise, pretty useful.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2016,3,Rough budget,Rough room in a good location. Lackadasical front desk man 'inshallah' but overall reliable. Be warned rooms are very rough and price isn't really that low. Having said that we would probably go back. Great is you want to hammer the medina by foot.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2016,4,Hotel Central,This hotel is one of those that is located within walking distance to Hassan II Mosque and the Old Medina of Casablanca. Price is within the low medium range.

 June 2016,4,good for what we wanted,Just a place to lay our head it had hot water a bed and the internet all things I consider basic we are going by train for a dy trip to markesh and if you want to look at the old town it is right in the heart of that.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2016,4,"Excellent location, budget stay","The hotel's location is perfect, near to the train station, hassan 2 mosque, rooms have a good view some cafes just below the hotel. Rooms are small yet nice. We stayed for just one night. The hotel accommodation rate is good for tight travel budgets. Also the front desk provided us with a map and recommended few places to go.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2016,1,Dirty and disrespectful,This was the worst hotel I've ever been too. The men at the front desk were not kind and when we told them that the room had no hot water (as read on previous reviews) they told us to leave and they didn't want us there so we left. Honestly don't bother here! The rooms are mouldy and there's no hot water. I would have preferred to have slept outside!!,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2016,3,Pleasant stay,"This hotel was basic to say the least and not all that clean. However it does give a authentic Moroccan stay, with traditional rooms, great staff, and a lovely warm welcome. It's in the very heart of the Medina, surrounded by the bustle of the markets, with dozens of unbelievably cheap restaurants just feet away. I enjoyed my stay hugely but this was largely due to location and staff rather than hotel rooms themselves",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2016,2,One night stay only,"To be honest...One night was more then enough and the best thing at this hotel is the location. So, if you wanna stay here use it as a transit hotel. The location is pretty close with Casa Port which is good for you to get access to Casablanca airport.......... The breakfast was simple and the room was a bit dirty. Bathroom really need some maintenance, but there was running hot water. Hotel gives cheap possibility for an alternative for visiting casablanca, but next time i rather go for something better, or something cheaper - don't think it was worth the money after all the places we have stayed in Morocco",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We arrived around 2am and rang the doorbell, to be greeted by the front desk staff/security guard – who was very friendly (at 2am, he was telling jokes!) The rooms are clean, no frills, just the basics. But if you need a place to crash that is safe, and centrally located – this is perfect. At checkout, like some other reviewers mentioned, there were extra charges, but these are city taxes per person. At the time of checkout the c/c machine didn't work, so bring cash. Staff walked us to our destination (tram stop) and explained the tram system, making sure we were on our way!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2015,3,A Nice Hotel,"Near to the Old Medina, as well as the new casa port train station, but I got off of the tram station at central station, being about a 20-25 min walk to the hotel.

 September 2015,2,Does not worth its price,"On the pictures it is quite okay, but in real life it is just not the worst. The bathroom is everything, just not comfortable to do anything. Our room was not dirty, but not enough clean for its price. The breakfast was ok. You can stay here for 1 or 2 nights, you will survive it without any big trouble, but for this price you can find much more better a little bit farther.

 September 2015,1,Next level terrible!,"We stayed here for two nights in the lead up to Eid El Adha as there were not many options available. Having been in Morocco for two weeks and staying mainly in hostels, I can safely say that Hotel Central was our worst experience. The owner runs the desk and is extremely rude. I paid for our reservation in full with Expedia who included the taxes. He hassled me for the tax 3 different times and I had to repeatedly show him my receipt. I could see how some people may be intimidated and pay up when they have already paid for taxes. Stay strong! We had an inner room with a window that opened up to a staircase that was absolutely saturated in bird poo. This meant being unable to have the window open to avoid inhaling the fumes. There was no air con/fan either so the room got…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The cons are the lack of a lift, old-looking rooms which need a revamp and cheap soap. But if it's just a room for the night at a reasonable price, this fits the bill. If your room faces the square, you get a taste of local life as there's a couple of restaurants and some hobos around but not troublesome at all.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Nice location right inside the medina, we had a nice little balcony overlooking the square. Close to Casa Port Train Station or the main one Casa Voyageur is only 15 Dh taxi away. 15-20 minute walk to Hassan II Mosque. Staff were friendly enough with us, gave us complimentary tea on our first night. Breakfast was decent. Wifi was good in both the lobby and in our room. The bathroom was run down, there was no shower curtain and the drain didn't work properly which made for a very wet bathroom after our showers. I'd say the value was good for Casablanca, not great for Morocco as it was expensive compared to the rest of the country. I'd recommend staying here just for one night, not long term.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2015,2,"Rude staff, no WiFi, no card payment","if you are staying for the price, consider first that you have to bring cash because even if the receptionist, that is very rude, tells you can pay with card, next morning he will say connection dropped as happened to me. also, no wifi... they shouldn't offer WiFi I'd they don't have it. at least room was quite okay, clean and great view from my room.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2015,4,Great location within walking distance of Hassan Mosque II,"This hotel was my first stop in Morocco after my long flight from Australia. It is easily within walking distance of Casa Port train station and is located within the medina. It is a short walk (20mins) from Hassan Mosque II and Rick's Café, and is quiet enough at night to get some rest after a day exploring. There is a square outside where local kids play football and adults go about their days. There is no lift so be ready to carry your bags upstairs. Basic breakfast (bread, yoghurt, boiled egg, juice and tea) is included which gives you some fuel to start exploring Casablanca.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2015,4,Good Location!,"Location is the best advantage to stay here, very close to Hassan 2 Mosque, the local market and the Casa Port train station. I stayed there for two nights. The host were very nice and the breakfast is awesome. Very well located inside the Medina and had no trouble finding it from the train station. When I missed my flight, i chose to book there again and i received a few discount. The only concern I had is the WiFi connection which seems non existent. They have a very nice rooftop with awesome view of the Medina. A little bit pricey. The Youth Hostel (HI Affiliated) is just next door.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2015,5,Fantastic,"Value for money, fantastic breakfast, great view and clean. Wifi offered but non existent, but who needs it! Lots of young travelers, right in the Madiena. Looking out of the blue shutters of the room, onto the Madiena, you could see children laugh and play, and the culture of the city come to life.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2015,4,"Old, creepy, nice location","I stayed one night here, the best location you can ask for, you can walk to the grand mosque, and to the station if you don't mind long distances, taxis with 15 dah can take you to all attractions around. And it is by the edge of the old Madina, that's good because you don't need to get lost to find your hotel, yet you can walk right onto the Medina at anytime. The hotel is very colonial french, old and no evidence of renovations anywhere. But it gives the feel of the 40s in Casablanca. Due to the coastal location of Casablanca, the humidity has its effects in the hotel, when it is not cold, things smell sometimes. If I've found a space in hostel I would have stayed there. But casa doesn't offer enough variety of options. Umm, the good thing is the kitchen, they have some…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 January 2015,2,"Rude Reception, Flooding Shower","We stayed here on Monday the 5th of January, arrived in the afternoon. The manager at the desk was certainly a character. He very abruptly put us in our rooms. As we came downstairs to confirm the price and payment, he rudely questioned: ""Right now? I'm eating!"" The room was small, but decent with a small balcony overlooking the square. We, along with other guests of the hotel had trouble with the wifi. It was unavailable for a period of time, when it eventually worked, there was none on our floor, only in the hallway of the 1st and 2nd floor. The bathroom was cramped and the shower didn't drain well. For $60/night, I would have expected much better considering having paid $30-$40 for nicer accommodations in Morocco. Location however, was good. It was near the train station,…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,4,Very nice,"No boutique hotel or similar en vogue establishment but a very agreeable down to earth littlle/mid sized hotel offering exactly what I had hoped for! Basic, clean and very conveniently located for both the medina and the seafront. Chose a top floor room if available ! Recommended",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,3,central and practical,"The best part of this hotel is its location: central in the old medina and the taxi can take you quite near to it so you don't have to get lost in the Medina looking for it. Apart from that the bathroom was a bit dirty, and the hotel did not have a hairdryer, the breakfast was quite scarce but at least they have free mint tea all day long. It is an ok place for short visits but we wouldn't recommend it for a long stay.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,4,Overall a decent deal - a rounded up 3.5,"I really liked this hotel. It has character, a good location and a whacky receptionist, who is nevertheless very friendly. There were some minor downsides, e.g. that the room was very drafty. We stayed mid December, and I suppose this is no issue 10 months out of 12. We were a bit cold however, but there was a working radiator and the shower was hot. Overall good, I'd give a 3.5 in winter and probably a 4 in summer.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2014,4,Good value for money,Well located within the medina and close to Casa Port station. The rooms are well furnished and had a tv with a good selection of channels. There was a really good breakfast and the staff were lovely. Enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend this hotel.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2014,4,Perfect for this solo traveler,"I needed a central place in Casablanca that would prove comfortable, congenial, and affordable. Not only did Hotel Central provide that, but the breakfasts provided just the right oomph to propel me throughout the city without feeling either hungry or loaded down. The wifi flickered a couple times and I wish I could have dined there in the evening, as well, but these remain minor quibbles. Especially enjoyed watching soccer in the hotel lobby while rain teemed outside.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2014,5,Great spot,"Wonderful place, very friendly. Staff went above and beyond to be helpful and friendly to us, from getting us there from the station to everything else during our stay. Also, be sure to eat at Casa Fish next door, it is worth it :O)",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2014,5,The best in Casablanca,"I was amazed by this hotel, it was clean, staff was very helpful and friendly and the location is in a beautiful square in medina. And Rick's cafe is 5 minutes away ;-) Btw and as a single female traveler I felt safe there",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2014,5,Fantastic place,"We loved the place, we were there two times. Two brothers running this place are fantastic people and very hilarious characters. Trully great views from balconies and the rooftop. Maybe it's not the place for people loving a-class hotels, but it's not bad at all. It's all you need, good relax and entertainment as well. you can park car around the hotel and it will be safe. In general fantastic place in the center of Casablanca.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,5,The one and only choice for us in Casablanca!,This is a small hotel located in the Old Medina district of Casablanca. The location is just perfect as you can walk pretty much everywhere from here. It's a beautiful building and the rooms are very comfortables. In the restaurant they serve a delicious breakfast and you can always pop down for a nice glass of mint tea! The nice gentleman in the reception made our stay the best ever. He was very helpful! Hopefully we will be back soon to try out the new opened sea food restaurant!,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2014,3,An adequate hotel for my simple needs,"I stayed two nights at the Hotel Central in Casablanca, Morocco. When I first saw the Hotel from distance, I thought I was looking at a movie set circa 1930s. As I approached the hotel’s entrance, I thought I might see Bogie walking out the front door. Wow! This place is ancient and charming at the same time. Ditto for the next door cafe/restaurant that belongs to the hotel. The hotel is located on the edge of the Ancienne Medina, which should tell you something about are area: old and quite dirty, but I accepted the place as is (I’m not too picky). The front desk folks signed me in and gave a nice room with a balcony on the second floor. It was very simple with a double bed, a flat screen TV that didn’t work, two nights tables, and a small closet. The bathroom had a shower…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2014,2,"Budget hotel, suitable for a very short stay","Located near the port, the hotel must have been a historical building by now. It looked like constructed before 1950s. Could be nice if you'd like to once in a while experience how it feels being in a hotel of old setting. King Hassan II mosque is like 10 minutes away on foot. Walking to the train station (Port) would be about 5 minutes only. The hotel could not be seen from the main road, though near, and taxis cannot bring you right in front of the hotel as it's located within pedestrian zone. The room was quite acceptable and they had LCD TV in it. I think they forgot to allocate a soap in the bathroom. There's no elevator if it matters. But lower floor tend to be busy as the front area of the hotel was like a small public park. We heard loud quarrel among teenagers at about…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2014,1,"Bed bugs, no wifi... Not worth the price","We walked into this hotel that we booked off hostelworld expecting nothing special, as soon as we checked into the room we pulled up the sheets and instantly found a few dead bed bugs as well as live ones. We informed the hotel and he simply switched us rooms. We later saw the door open to the room and the bed had simply been remade. I'm sure he was just going to resell the room. Wifi was also not working, which really made planning our next move hard. Bed sheets in our new room were dirty, I found hairs on them. For 40 euros a night, I would suggest paying a bit more and going somewhere that isn't as awful.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,3,Good Budget Hotel - Good Location,"Walking distance (1 mile) to the Hassan II Mosque, located near Medina, great price for location at ~$56/night including breakfast. The hotel isn't anything special, other than looking like something out of the French Quarter in New Orleans, it just has a great location and a great price. The concierge knew English and was helpful in providing some assistance (and the free wifi password). Not the cleanest, but serviceable, basic room. The breakfast was a nice additional service, and consisted of yogurt, pastries, and coffee/tea. It was a little noisy outside, as other reviewers point out. Mostly safe area, but some roads felt a little deserted as you get closer to the Marina. Also less than a mile from Rick's Cafe if you're interested in dining there (excellent top notch food…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2014,3,The location and friendly staff saves this hotel,"Well for one, I have to say you certainly shouldn't come to these kinds of places and expect any kind of luxury. That's just not happening. You get the basic of the basic. I do have to be honest and tell you that my room was quite dirty (roaches in the bathroom, peach seeds on the floor, etc) however the receptionist did tell us that we could switch rooms in the morning when he first handed us the keys. I'm guessing he knew that the room was horrible?? I don't know. The bathroom, the sheets, the floor...clearly they didn't have a cleaning lady. Oh and no AC but the nights were pretty cool when we were there. My brother stayed an extra day and told me that he ended up peeking into a few other rooms that were quite nice (freshly painted walls, clean floors, etc) so we…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2014,5,"Great location, great value, friendly staff, lots of character","If you can sleep through some street noise (the hotel is located right at the corner of a busy square in the old medina), this is an excellent value and centrally located and has tons more character than the nearby chain hotels downtown, which are higher priced and have no charm. We had a great room (triple with a balcony on the front corner of the building with two wide windows on each side which gave us a great vantage point on the active city life below). Our room was clean and the breakfast satisfying. We stayed here 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We would stay again.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2014,1,"Good location, but dirty hotel","Personel was really friendly, but the room was really dirty and there was a lot of street noise during the night.

 May 2014,3,"Good location, budget price, budget hotel","15-20 mins walk to the Mosque, located inside the medina near the port. You can go to the medina (old town) by the tram from train station Casa Voyageurs (takes 10 mins and DH 6) . Though we sent email to reserve the preferred room, the room we got was facing the back wall, it's dirty outside so you can't open the window. The room is not very clean especially the floor, and it's a very low end hotel that staying for 1 night for transit is good enough with its location and budget price. The manager (reception) is very nice, ok breakfast, no wifi in room, very limited and unstable at reception either. McDonalds and many café, restaurants are just in 10-15 mins walk outside the medina.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2014,3,"Great location, disappointing stay","We stayed at the hotel for one night and were 'welcomed' by Abdul who was far from helpful. With his odd sense of humour, we did not feel very comfortable here at all. After staying in some lovely Riads in Morocco this was quite a disappointment. The wifi was hopeless, only working some of the time in the main lobby. The rooms were very basic and quite dusty. Our toilet was broken on arrival but after all out fruitless conversations with Abdul we didn't feel we could approach him about the matter late at night. The breakfast was poor, not even a plate to eat it on. Who wants olives for breakfast?! To be fair the hotel was in a good location near the train station (Casa Port) and the medina. It served a purpose for the night but would not have liked to stay any longer.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2014,4,Fair price stay in Casa,"Very simple hotel, but clean and with excellent location (close to most Casa sights - medina, Hassan II mosque, center). Price is fair compared to other hotels in Casablanca (one of the cheapest ones with such a good location). Can be reached by taxi (next to the port) or by foot from the center (via the medina). No lift, and noone to carry your bags up to your room. Rooms averlooking the square are noisy. Staff is not as friendly as others in Morocco. On the whole the hotel is a good (and fair price) choice for a short (one or two nights) stay.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2014,2,Very basic hotel,"It was a very basic hotel. Good: - location - Little balcony from our room - Cheap (cheaper than other places in Casablanca but definitely expensive for what it is) Bad: - Breakfast was always the same. One boiled egg, bread, tea or coffee, orange juice - Dark bathroom - Balcony door didn't close properly - uncomfortable bed - noisy as it is facing the square Reception guy had a weird sense of humor, I didn't know how to react to it... made me a little uncomfortable.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2014,4,Affordable hotel on a nice location,"Nicely located next to a small square with bars. Very friendly receptionist. Nice breakfast area. Decent, although quite small, room with good beds.

The location was perfect for us in the old medina, very close to places we wanted to see and even for two young girls aged 24 very safe. The owner's are very kind and helpful, giving you advise, without trying to get out money from you which was not the case for most of the places in casa and we really appreciated it. The room was no luxury, which in my opinion you can not expect for the price, even if the living kost are not as high as in Europe. It was clean and and had everything we neede and the view on the port from the balcony was amazing.

View - we had a 3rd floor room with a view on a port and Hassan II Mosque! Really nice! 4. Terrace on the roof - I don't have to explain:) Desadvantages: 1. No heating in winter and as I suppose no aircon in summer. So it was quite cold at nigt in Februrary. 2. Nice budget hotel, better than most of the hostels in Morocco. If you are looking for a quite cheap and good acocomodation you can go there. To get there go from the port - the easiest way, better then from medina.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 February 2014,3,"Basic, clean accommodation","A basic, hostel type of accommodation. Rooms were clean. It was somewhat chilly this time of the year, but we survived. Had to get used to shower with no stall or curtain, but water was hot, and worked well. Basic Moroccan breakfast. Walls are thin, so you can hear noise, but this what we have found in all our Moroccan accommodations.. Good budget choice.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2014,3,Room for improvement,"As others have pointed out, this hotel is more of a hostel. The rooms have the basic amenities, and mine was clean, so I can't complain on that front. The bathroom would be improved by the addition of a shower curtain. Noise from other guests is a problem and management should look at having a policy about that - although it shouldn't be necessary to remind adults not to run and shout in the corridors. With the receptionists, it depends who you get. The older bald guy acts friendly, but you can tell that he'd rather be somewhere else. The older man with salt-and-pepper hair is very nice. As other reviewers have also said, the rooms don't have heating or air con, so it does get cold in winter and the bedding alone won't keep you warm. Bring your sleeping bag. Wifi is…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2014,3,"REALLY basic, no hot water, grungy location.","This place is really more like a hostel, and there isn't much ""traditional"" Moroccan about it. It's clean and pleasant enough if you are on a tight budget, but it didn't have much to offer. It felt a bit institutional and not particularly warm or inviting. The staff was smiling and laughing, but in an insincere way - like asking you how you are, but then busying themselves with something else and ignoring your answer. Their language skills in English and Spanish were extremely limited, and they couldn't provide much info on the area. It was FREEZING at night in January, and there was no heat whatsoever in the room. The night was extremely cold, and I would never stay here again in winter. To make matters worse, the hot water was also out during most of our stay. The breakfast…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2013,4,Nice stay in Casablanca,"We stayed at Hotel Central for two nights at the beginning of our trip to Morocco, and on the last night before leaving. The owner was amazing, and said to us upon our return: ""The first time you are guests, the second time, you are family!"" He treated us wonderfully, pointing out great places on the map, and was happy to have us back again. The breakfast at the hotel was nice, and because we had to leave so early for the airport, he awoke early to make sure that we got our breakfast before heading out. His brother is also nice, but reserved, so don't let this be a turn off to you.

 December 2013,3,So-So Stay,"This hotel was definitely a budget hotel. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are old, but things are clean and the price isn't bad.

 February 2013,4,Unique Hotel Experience,"My friends and I stayed here in February 2013 for three nights. If you are looking for a fancy hotel, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a more unique and traditional Moroccan experience for a good price, this is the place for you. It is located very central, in the heart of the life of the city and close to the medina. It is not always quiet, but you feel as if you are getting a more real experience of Moroccan life. The owner is friendly and so helpful. Anytime we needed information or anything at all, he arranged it for us. He gave us good tips and took care of us. The rooms are not fancy but have everything you need. A very good price if that is important to you. We had a great stay there.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2013,3,The cheapest one that I could get in Casablanca,"I stayed in this hotel for two days, first day and last day in Morocco. The room was equiped with basic facility. There is television, but AC is not available in the room. They provide towels, shampoo and soap.,WIFI was just available in public space. It's located in Medina, very closed from the main road, and only 15-20 minutes walking to Hasan II Mosque. The breakfast is average. The receptionists were very friendly and kind. I could make a booking through email. It's suitable place if you want to stay at budget hotel (this is the cheapest one that I could get in Casablanca) and don't plan to stay long. From Casa voyage, I took petite taxi and cost me 20 Dirham for one way.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,3,Think of it as a hostel,This is a budget accommodation and it looks more of a hostel than a hotel. The location is nice and in the Medina and is only 15 mins walk from the Hassan 2 mosque. it is also close to the cafe. the rooms are very basic with just some linens and no toilet supplies. the rooms are located on several floors (I think 3 or more floors) and there is no elevator so keep this in mind if you have lots of big luggage. The room has TV and has no AC. If you are lucky your window might just open on the square side where you might have some chance of winds. Otherwise you'll be peeking into other windows if your room is on the back side specially at night when you have to leave your window open.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2013,5,the mast important experience,it was verry nice hotel nice people nice man in the reception and also very nice place verry close the the best market in medina close also to the beach and close for all important place for tourisme really it was 3 DAY of happinesse and friendelly i will back soon to morocco and also i will be in this hotel i will miss the breakfast and i will miss abdoul the man of the reception and abdosadak the man of bar,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,3,What can I say?,"What can I say about this hotel? First, if you are on a very low budget, this might be a perfect hotel for you. It´s located in the Medina, and for some foreigners that might be ""scary"" enough. We had rooms looking out on the open square that results in quite a lot of noise during the night. There are also two minarets - at least - close to the hotel, so be prepared to wake up at 5.30am. My bed had fleas, especially under the pillow. Killed about 15 before I fell asleep. Bathroom get all wet while showering. No AC. However, the staff was friendly, breakfast, coffee and tea was good and the receptionist made us a good shisha in the evening. WiFi quality is like most of the low-cost hotels in Morocco. This was only working in the reception area. We were four guys staying there,…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

After checked in I locked the door and went out. I left my I phone 5 and money ( 40 Euro+11,000 THB) in the room and they got stolen from the room. A man at the reception he admitted that the hotel has spare keys. I asked him to call someone who can make decision about this situation. Then he called Bourhim Abdelmrek (phone 0661245533). But both of them didn't help me any thing so I asked for the police. Two policemen came but did nothing and left. I never have this experience before that my things get stolen from the room ! very bad hotel and no responsibility !",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,5,Nice hotel for it's money and great location,"This hotel is 2 stars so don't expect luxury. And for it's declared 2 stars it is perfectly fine. Rooms were simple but clean and beds were nice, so I dunno what bed bugs people are talking about. Location is great, it is just at the border of the medina and it takes 3 minutes drive by taxi or 15 minutes by feet to Hassan II Mosque. There is something charming in the style of the hotel, it is not polished and rubber-stamped like chain hotels in big modern buildings on avenues nearby. One thing is important to mention that there is no private parking at the hotel and I strongly recommend you not to leave car on streets outside; ask reception, there is parking 5 minutes away from hotel. Our rental car was damaged at night by some drunk jerk, apparently it is just merely bad luck,…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2013,1,Bed bugs,Do not go here. I got a very bad case of bed bugs. On the bright side breakfast is nice - good bread and eggs and the coffee was quite good. The hotel is in a good location. The staff were friendly although the humor occasionally went too far and they weren't overly accommodating,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2013,3,ok hotel,"Probably the best hotel in the medina. Due to it's location on the outskirt of the medina about 1 minute from the mainstream of human traffic flow, it is quite quiet. There are 2 types of rooms. 1st type faces the wall of another building 4m away so the rooms are rather dark with views of other's windows. 2nd type faces the square so it is airy and brighter but also some noise. All rooms do not have fan. All have flies coming in from the window. Need a spray of some sort to keep them out. Staff are friendly.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2013,4,Great location and very good value for money,"Abdul was very nice and helpful. My friend arrived late at night and he arranged her some food to eat. The hotel is close to great restaurants, the mosque and the medina. The rooms are comfortable, the bathrooms are small, but with hot showers and clean. They gave me a room with a balcony overlooking the port and the square on my second stay, it was airy and light, very nice. I would definitely recommend this place, great value for budget travelers and a nice place to crash before heading somewhere else in Morocco!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2012,1,awful,"The hotel is ugly, dirty and everytime you take a bath, there is water all over! I got bedbugs at this hotel! avoid it for sure!

It's not amazing,",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2013,1,Worst Hotel ever,"We thought it would be a proper hotel, but it was more like a camping. The receptionist was mad, he kept shouting out loud in the reception. The shower was horrible, just the beginning of the first shower was warm and the rest very cold. The place ugly and horrible, close to a train station which made a lot of noise. The wifi was broken.

 July 2013,2,"Shabby & noisy rooms, terrible nights sleep & woke up with insect bites all over... look for somewhere else!","This was the worst room we stayed in whilst travelling around Morocco. On a budget, we picked all our hotels/b&b's according to their value for money. This hotel was one of the cheaper options in Casa. However... the location of the hotel means there is a lot of noise (not much the hotel can do about this!) & the medina did not feel safe at night. The noise from within the hotel was terrible, the walls must be paper thin. We could hear people talking & opening/closing doors all night. The rooms are fairly shabby & I woke up with numerous insect bites throughout the night, although the rooms did appear clean, the shower & toilet worked fine & there was hot water. The patio style windows did not close properly and this room was desperately in need of some attention. Nothing major,…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2013,3,Good budget hotel in a convenient location,"I recently stayed at the Hotel Central for 2 separate nights at the beginning and end of travels in Morocco. Compared to the cost of other hotels in Casablanca, this was on the much cheaper side, so you’re certainly not getting a lot of luxuries, but the hotel is clean and in a convenient location. I thought the hotel was more nicely decorated than many other budget hotels that I’ve stayed at in Morocco. The owners are friendly and helpful and gave us a map with information about the area. The hotel is just inside the old medina and away from the main commercial area, but the owners lock the hotel at night and we felt very safe. It’s about a 10-15 minute walk to the Casa Port train station, Nations-Unis tram stop, and CTM bus station. To get to the hotel, you walk down…",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The man at the reception desk is just strange. Sometimes he mumbled to himself in Arabic knowing full well we didn't understand him. He didn't help us with our bags nor did he ask if we needed any help (we did, but we managed anyhow). It's a long winding stairwell so it was difficult going up with our heavy bags. The cleaning lady (the one we saw on arrival) looked at us with a blank face and simply stared. It's clear she doesn't like her job. The man at the front desk didn't offer much help and pretty much just left us to fend for ourselves with everything else, except two things.

 April 2013,3,Meet my requirement,"I thought it should be one of the cheapest accommodation in Casa, even so it met my requirement: room is spacious, neat and relatively clean, good location, staff is nice.

When we arrived at the hotel on the Saturday night, we were told by the very smug owner/receptionist that the hotel was full. We showed him our booking form, at which he shrugged his shoulders and said that the hotel was full. A large group had arrived and he had rented out all of the rooms to them as they were going to stay for a few nights (and he would therefore make more money).

The same happened to two other groups that arrived at the same time, their names were also in the book. They did not apologize or attempt to accomodate us, instead we were sent in a taxi to a different hotel having been told we would pay the same. 6 of us were made to sit in one taxi and another couple who went in a seperate one were even made to pay for it themselves.

The hotel faces an intimate little square with two small well-tended gardens. A post office and ATM plus numerous little cafes are also in the square and you are well-placed for discovering the locality as well as the city centre and the Mosque. The city's new tram system will now take you to the beach as well as around town in comfort. The hotel is basic but comfortable and I slept well. Glorious hot shower.

 December 2012,4,good location,The hotel is on a good location in medina and close to the harbor. We got a room on a second floor with a nice view.

Otherwise it is less than 15 minute walk from Hassan II mosque and 5 minute walk from Rick's cafe.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2013,3,Good location,"We stayed one night in January, the hotel was very tired, towel rail hanging off ect.. it did get cold through night, ( no heating) but overall our room was clean, the hot shower was excellent, the location was brilliant, ask for a room facing the harbour, if you are on a budget or are only staying in casa for a one night stopover it is a good option, we liked it.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2012,5,great place,We stayed in a double bedroom with bathroom on the top floor facing Casablanca's fishing harbor. What a charming experience! We spent the first hours of the day observing the arrival of the fishing boats surrounded by screaming seagulls. Hotel Central is wonderfully located in the Medina (few minutes walking distance from the downtown) and has a very nice atmosphere and friendly staff.

The traditional Moroccan lounge, with its beautiful mosaic and carpets, is filled with new friends and everyone enjoyed sharing delicious breakfast and shisha with the owners. Outside the front door is a popular square filled with fresh fruits and men playing cards games, it gives a very relaxed feel to the city setting it is in. Sleeping in, in the morning, is out of the question though... first morning prayer is played over speakers and is amplified and echoed in the square.

We decided to come back a second time and had a nice room to the street with a balcony and a bigger bathroom.

We took a taxi from the train station in what seemed like a video game of bumper cars (which was daring and exhilarating at the same time - I digress)! The hotel is nothing to write home about; just okay for a night considering the price. It's a transient spot. We flew into Casa then headed to Marrakech the next morning and on our return, same deal - stayed here 1 night then flew out next morning. The receptionist was wacky, to say the least.

Granted its not 5 star , but what do you expect for the very reasonable price. Rooms were clean and cheerful , if small , which is standard for this price range. Owners were very friendly and helpful , and the breakfast was above average. The hotel has a very nice little cafe/coffee bar where you can sit with the locals watching passing life in the adjacent square.

The staff were quite helpful and funny to converse with. But overall very grimy and dirty.

The jokes (and casual racism) of the owner aside, this place was okay but nothing more. On the downside, pretty noisy, with windows that didn't properly close; a shower that was just in the middle of the bathroom, with the floor hardly lower, so the water went aaaaabsolutely everywhere; and prices that were not particularly cheap, by Moroccan standards, for 2-star level accomodation.

We were looking for good budget accomodation for one night in Casablanca before going to Marrakech and the hotel was quite perfect for that. Located just outside the Medina, very easy to find. The rooms were absolutely clean and cosy, not cold at all (January), pletnty of hot water, very kind staff. The breakfast was good as well - mint tea, orange juice, local bread butter and jam.

The room was okay but the bathroom was not practical and ended up flooding anytime someone took a shower. There are lots of shady characters who linger around downstairs, as a group of females we felt very uncomfortable. People kept lying to us about where things were and we had just had enough.

It was very basic and I was concerned immediately about the safety of our bags in our room - the windows did not seem to lock properly and there were lots of people about on the street below watching us arrive at the hotel. It was very off putting. Our room was on the third level - it overlooked the noisy dockyards and the street. While the bed sheets were nice and clean the bathroom left a lot to be desired - no shower curtain and EVERYTHING got wet when you turned the shower on, plus the bottom of the shower was a bit filthy.

I had booked rooms about 1 month before our arrival and sent confirmation e-mail about 2 days before ( I received feedback from them: “See you then”) but when we arrived to the hotel one nasty fellow informed us that he did not know anything about reservation and did not have our names in his notebook. I would like to add that it was midnight so you can imagine how shocking information it was for us. Definitely he was hostile to us. Even he did not want to inform us about other hotels in surrounding. If you do not want your first night in Morocco to be spoiled avoid that place.,Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2011,3,You can find much better for much less!,"We booked this hotel just 'cause it was almost full and the other ones you can find on the internet are not as cheap as this one. When we get to Casablanca, we realized there were so many hotels around, that booking online is definitely not the best option, as you pay more (there are hotels you can pay 25€ per night for a double, just near this one). SO, DON'T GET SCARED YOU'RE SURELY GONNA FIND SOMETHING ELSE! The first room we got had a leaking loo and no light in the bathroom. Second one was quite ok, but shower is open with no curtain, so everything gets wet around.

We rented two triple rooms which was great. At first glance the hotel seemed clean, but on closer inspection, the sheets in one of the rooms had a few dead bugs on them and after a few hours we noticed that in addition to the dead bugs, there were bed bugs crawling all over the bed.

 April 2011,2,NOISY,"For a budget guesthouse with double room, this one does not worth the money. Since it is very near to the Mosque, the morning call for prayer will definitely wake you up during sunrise. We stayed in the seaview room which faces the main street and square of the medina, it is very noisy at night till midnight. Since there's no air-con, you can't just shut the window. Even we closed the windows, it's not sound proof at all! Good thing about this hotel is it's only 15mins walk from the train station and it's cheaper than others. But I'd recommend Ibis which is 3 mins walk from the station and not much more expensive.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 February 2011,3,"A cheap stay, get money's worth","We went to Casa for 1 day and 1 night. The inside is nicely decorated, a bit cheesy and more of a hostal than a hotel. The rooms are cute and spacious. There is no heating so it's very cold. The bathrooms appeared clean but the towels were dingy so I didn't shower. The floors in the rooms are not very clean. You get free breakfast and complimentary Moroccan tea throughout the day. The receptionist is very friendly and a bit weird. The hotel is very close to the Casa train station (7 mins walking) and it's right behind the old medina where you can shop. It's also walking distance from the Grand Mosque (about 20 mins). Overall it was a cheap stay but I definitely wouldn't want to stay for more than 2 nights.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 January 2011,1,BED BUGS!,"The hotel staff was quite friendly and even gave us a discount because we were leaving for an early flight. The location is just a short walk from rick's cafe though the area itself is a little sketchy. Rooms are basic, our bathroom did not seem to have been cleaned and no new towels had been added.

I called Desert-Trips to make arrangements for me since I was too late to get to rental arrangements in Rabat area. I was delighted with the economical choice. Perhaps due to the season, I saw no beggars or homeless transients in the area. The hotel has character with an amazing central staircase. I enjoyed the colour combinations and paintings on the walls. Perhaps I was too tired to notice, but the area was not noisy the night of December 20 when I was there.

Casablanca in general was chaos and I would not recommend visiting the place, but if you must then I would advise you to look around. Now our rooms were clean and we did not have any major problems.

Upon my arrival, I requested from Mr. Mohammed to have a double room given that my fiancée was planned to arrive the following day, of which I informed Mr. Mohammed. At that moment, he did not ask any questions or inform me about any details; but when he saw my black fiancée, he immediately asked for our marriage certificate in a not very friendly way. Whereas I knew that in some hotels in Morocco, unmarried couples cannot stay in a double room, I was disturbed by Mr. Mohammed’s way of demanding the certificate given that I previously informed him about the arrival of my fiancée.

Location is quite scaring - beggars sleeping in the street, shady people hanging all around. Man on reception was not either much friendly or helpful; room was tiny, dark and not cosy at all, the only furniture in a room - beds and a tiny table with 1 chair. Bed was extremely narrow and very old, small window faced grey dirty wall of the next building and didnt provide enough day-light. Bathroom was same disappointing - unneat basin for the shower, unneat toilet and some water on the floor running (I assume) just from under the toilet.

 September 2010,1,Very disappointing,"We chose this hotel based on the good reviews here, I can only say we were bitterly disappointed. We arrived fairly late in the evening and received none of the for mentioned hospitality, in fact we were pretty shocked to see homeless people sleeping inside the small gap between the shutters and the railings on the ground floor, with even more dubious characters loitering around the outside of the hotel. Even though we had booked well in advance, we were given a tiny room on the top floor of the hotel, we had no offer to carry our bags up the stairs and when I asked for something to drink we were grunted at and given a look of contempt (I had no desire to venture out) but at least two bottles of Sprite were produced even though it felt like we had done him a disservice.

Obviously, this hotel has tradition and it used to be great and well decorated. Nowadays I would say that the hotel is a bit run down, although it has ""something"" that you feel comfortable.It is decorated in Morrocan style so it is not sterile and cold as some other hotels. Our room, which was backside room, overlooking...hmm..in a bad state building and the view was really unpleasant. I suppose, the rooms with the views to the park are much better and perhaps bigger.

 July 2010,4,Great Value For Money!,"This is a great hotel to get the real Moroccan life. It's much more enjoyable than staying in a flash modern hotel that might not even have a good location. The room was a little run down but it wasn't unpleasant. We wanted to stay somewhere with a nice Moroccan feel and this hotel was perfect for anyone who wants the same. The only downside was the noise outside from locals chatting downstairs and the shower didn't have a curtain or glass surrounding so the water saturates the floor. The staff are lovely and the mint tea was divine! Breakfast was only breads and jam and butter which was simple and a bit plain, but still enjoyable!",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

It proved to be a great value, and the man at the front desk was wonderfully friendly and helpful when we arrived. He gave us a thousand copies of the same map--some which we still have floating around our backpacks.He also gave us a huge room (two twin beds and a double) with a sitting area. It looked out onto the courtyard--at first, charming. However, later that night, when the endless motorbike races around said courtyard began, we were a little less charmed. Sadly, we didn't sleep much during the night. Pehaps rooms at the back of the hotel are quieter? Breakfast was delicious, and the dining area was nicely decorated.

The staff, Especially Abdul Malek, looked after me in every aspect. If you don't speak French or Arabic, Casablanca can be a bit challenging to conquer. Members of the staff personally walked me to restaurants, provided transportation, let me know what I should be paying for taxis and medina buys and made me feel like a part of their family. Mint tea was Always given upon entering the hotel without even asking. The staff with whom I couldn't communicate so well went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable.

Only a 10 minute-walk away from the trainstation (casa port) and a 20minute stroll through the medina to the Hassan 2 Mosque. Very friendly staff who helps you with your luggage. I was offered a cup of mint-tea while I was checking my mail on the (free) internet. Also the next day we could leave our lugage so we could do some sightseeing before heading to the station. We had a nice room (1st floor) on the corner with 2 balconies and a nice view on the square. We did have hot water in the shower. It was our first impression of Morocco and we really loved it, espacially after having also bad experiences later during our holiday. Not luxury but absolutely valuable for the money (€35,-).",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Having now stayed there twice I offer the following personal opinion and comment. The hotel is in a great location; we were made very welcome on our initial stay and welcomed back again later in the trip, greeted by name and a reference to our country of origin. The rooms were basic but they were clean, there was copious hot water and the beds were comfortable. As a reader I appreciated the addition of proper bedside lights.

The rooms were nice, with views looking out over the square, and further out into the port. On our second stay, the volume on the tv in our room was broken (english-language satellite stations), and the drain in the bathroom didn't work well. The breakfast was basic but good. Lots of shops and restaurants within a short walk of the hotel. Free wi-fi in the lobby, but not in the rooms. They also had two computers for guest use with internet access. Staff were nice.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2009,4,Best you will find in Old Medina,"If you are looking for a taste of the OLD Casablanca, you will want to stay in Old Medina which is the original city of Casablanca. Other reviews talk of unsafe areas, but there isn't a part of Casablanca itself that is entirely safe at night even in the more modern parts of the city. If you are looking for a Daytona Beach, FL vacation, go to Marrakesh. If you want an experience you won't forget, stay in Old Medina. We found this hotel on a hotels website where it had very good reviews. We hold the same opinion of this hotel.

Nice to be able to head up to the roof for a view. Although, mixed scenery from up there. Some buildings that are in rough shape, the absolutely beautifully designed Mosque, the port... Had some mint tea there and also had my first tagine in Morocco at the attached restaurant. This was good. The area in front of the hotel seemed a bit suspect - even our taxi driver told us that if you wanted to score some stuff, you could get it here.

 May 2009,2,"A bit surrealistic, but fun to stay...","We arrived Casablanca late in the evening, so needed a place to stay. Hotel Central is exactly like that. Just a place to stay. The taxi from the areport to the hotel was 300 MAD, without bargaining. The receptionist was really funny... seriuosly... probably also high like a kite.. so our adventour started from the beginning. The room we got was shocking, it had no view at all - only to the neighbour house'wall - than the smell was old, and musty, the bathroom was not cleaned at all, so we decided to ask and change our room... and went up to the roof - at least a view is better. Overall, the rooms from 20 - 34 is better. So, don't worry and ask for a change if you don't like your room. The stuff is really kind, the breakfast was ok.

 April 2009,4,A pleasant surprise,"We had read other reviews and expected the area to be dodgy, and it probably was at night but after 23 hours travelling from Australia we were in bed before dark so didn't see anything unpleasant. This was a cheap hotel so it wasn't fancy, but for the money I think it was great value. Free interntet, all the Moroccan mint tea you can drink, clean rooms, comfy bed and friendly staff. My ultimate tip would be to skip Casa Blanca all together; there's very little to see and do, it's just a big dirty city. If you must fly into Casa Blanca it's very easy to get a train from the aiport to La Oasis train station then switch trains to go straight to Marrkech (about 3 hours away).

 April 2009,3,Not bad,"We stayed for two nights, one night in room 35, on the rooftop and one in room 2, on the first floor. The rooftop-rooms are spartan and a bit damp (in April) but you have a great terrace at our doorstep with views all over the old medina. But the other guests use the terrace too so it can get noisy I guess (we were lucky). The first floor room was great, nice decor and a balcony overviewing the small square. The neighbourhood is OK, allthough I wouldn't walk there by myself at night. But that goes for all medinas. The rooftoprooms are not worth the 400 dirham, the first floor room definately are. They have 3 pc's with free internet acces on the groundfloor. Breakfast is good with big glasses of orange juice, morrocan pancakes and bread, butter and jam.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2009,3,A RATHER DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE,"I agree with the other reviewers who said you can skip Casablanca but if you stay in Casablanca, you can find a nicer hotel for not much more money. Hotel Central's review led me to expect a charming and modest recently renovated hotel with lovely views and a nice park in front and it was located near the train station. I found everything to be the opposite. My room had no view and was not newly renovated. The rooftoop views were of trash-strewn rooftops. It was near a train station not THE train station that you would take to other major Moroccan cities. The park and area seemed a bit seedy but never felt dangerous.

And the bathroom, c'mon how there is a shower without curtains?, get all the bathroom with water, for what? spend a little of money please.

(And I'd skip Casablanca altogether if I went back.) I think staying at Hotel Central may be a better value as a single traveler, as my husband and I thought 400dh/night (about $50) was a little steep for the room and bathroom we got.

We did find the hostel to be very loud at night, and not terribly secure, but acceptable, as we were traveling as a pair. When walking back to the hostel at night, it is situated in a square with a bar and small park area with benches, etc. We felt relatively safe, however, if I had been a single female traveler, it may have been a different story. The staff was kind, and high throughout our visit. The breakfasts are simple but excellent- fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee/tea, and bread with butter and orange marmalade. There is wi-fi, but its spotty and slow, so be prepared.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2008,4,The Nicest Owner In The World,"This place totally sorted us out. My newly-wed and I arrived in Casablanca from an overnight bus from Essaouira at about half past four in the morning. A slight negative, despite the excellent location, is that no taxi drivers know where it is!! we recommend telling the taxi diver to go to the youth hostel that is next door. Anyhoo, we arrived at about half five and after waking up Mohammed it was established that check in was not until midday. However, Mohammed did not want us roaming the streets of Casablanca and was happy to put us up early and the charge of only one night. From then he was nothing but pleasant and ethusiatic about our stay, even when we interrupted him praying. Excellent value for money and the best coffee in the whole of Morocco.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Breakfast is included and good. The staff was very helpful and got me a taxi at 5:30am when I needed it on my departure day. There's free internet terminals available. The bad: the part of the Medina that the hotel is in seems a bit sketchy, and though it's central, you have to walk a bit to get anywhere. The room with the internet terminals was fairly dirty.

The bed was also very comfortable. The balcony outside the room is also nice, overlooking the courtyard, with a view of the Atlantic Ocean beyond the harbor. However, it can be a bit noisy at times.

They constantly brought us tangerines and always had a big smile on their face. When we returend from Marrakesh and needed to store our luggage before our flight from Casablanca, the owners offered to watch our stuff for free and still offered tangerines and their place to lounge. We stayed on the first floor overlooking the medina with two balconies and very nicely furnished. I would defintely recommend this hotel for its central location and friendly staff.",Hotel_Central-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
