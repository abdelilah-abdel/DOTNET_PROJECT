 May 2022,5,Best hotel in Tangier,"This our second stay at Minzah and my wife, toddler and I absolutely love it there. Very pleasant and helpful staff, got upgraded to a suite free of charge and very flexible when we asked for additional nights. Very safe hotel. Breakfast is absolutely lovely. Cleaning is always very neat and tidy. Walking distance to just about any thing. Looking forward to enjoy another stay at my favourite hotel in Tangier soon again.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2022,2,It’s Coming!,"The hotel is a charming echo of the old French Colonial times. Beautiful architecture of traditional Islamic style with a peaceful central courtyard and nice pool area. The big issue I have with this hotel is the appalling slow food and bar service. Even getting a coffee or beer can take 30- 40 minutes. The food in the poolside restaurant is good - when it arrives. The breakfast buffet is good, and seeing as it’s self service the waiting is not an issue. The rooms are fine, clean and comfortable with a variety of views available. We found the strap line of this hotel is, ‘It’s Coming!’ - the standard reply when chasing an order.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2022,4,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL IN A PERFECT LOCATION,"Beautiful hotel located just half an hour from the airport and close to the Medina. The rooms are lovely and the beds comfortable. The cleanliness of the bathroom could be better as well as the cleanliness of the towels. In the room you have a complimentary bottle of water and in the bathrooms some amenities like shower gel, shampoo and others. All the corners of this hotel are stunning and beautifully decorated. The breakfast buffet is very good with plenty of choices. All the staff are very nice and always prepared to help whenever you need.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2022,4,Arabian Nights in Tanger,"As written in the LoneLy Planet Morocco on Tanger, many sleeping options in Tanger are showing their age. So can be said re El Minzah. Built in the 1920s it is still a spectacular building, however is somewhat worn here and there now. Service at the hotel was excellent thoughout and considering the price tag, I think staying here is a good choice for a few Arabian nights in Tanger.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2022,4,Great location,"The good about El Minzah was the location, the pool and the history of the hotel. The bell staff and waiters were also very nice. The men that checked me in were not so great. They were a bit abrupt and not friendly. I asked for a map and they just said they didn't have one. Most hotels will print something out. When our room was not correct (we requested 2 beds) they gave us another room which was not cleaned (and this after waiting two hours for our initial room). They were completely unapologetic. With that said, the man at the front desk later was very nice so perhaps the first two were an anomaly. The breakfast was fabulous and the room facing the ocean had a great view. The interior facing room was fine. Food was expensive so I would recommend eating just outside…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2022,1,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE , NOT 5 STAR !!!","So we decided me and my friends to have dinner last Friday 17/06/2022 in the hotel's restaurant ... i have to admit the view is beautiful but when it comes to service and hygiene and staff atttitude it is not okay neither professional at all .. we ordered dinner , and while i was going to start with my dish i found a cockroach in my plate , i felt sick on the spot .... it is soooooo disapointing and digsusting sorry for the word . I went to the waiter to give me a coke , atleast as a gesture he should have give it to me complimentary by finding a cockroach in my plate at a 5 star hotel ..

 April 2022,5,Excellent as always and great service,"We have stayed at this hotel on many occasions as we visit our family in Tangier (oulad hadj ahmed family) The hotel is iconic, steeped in history and it has the old fashioned charm that we love so much. It is clean and has very good standards and service all around. The staff are helpful, attentive and they all speak very good English plus many other languages. This hotel never changes (over the years we have visited) in regards to its standards and service being excellent. The pool is always very clean and well cared for and garden is pretty and relaxing. There is also a beautiful view. From the rooms the view over Tangier is super during the day and night. We tend to always find ourselves staying in room 317 which has a perfect view. The bed linen is crisp…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2021,5,The Best experience ever in tangier,"So i am confused about which fair words i should apply to express my feedback about my experience in this beautiful property ... The great service from all the staff without exception ( concierge team , reception team , housekeeping team , lifeguard , food and beverage team ) their anticipation of my needs , their sincere greeting , their smile ... i was really impressed about every single detail in this property , and ofcours i need to mention the great location of this amazing property . well in fact generally my stay in this hotel was incredible ... thank you to everyone and for sure i will go back soon , can t wait to see u again guys and well done .",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2021,3,NOT a 5 star hotel,"This hotel is not 5 stars as advertised. It is quite dated. Staff is friendly but they are not given much to work with. Had the impression they were understaffed while we were there and of course you can blame COVID for everything nowadays. Enjoyed breakfast outside even though the weather was very rainy but it was better than inside the smokey breakfast room. The area around the hotel is quite rough with people begging and trying to sell you things. Would not stay here again, sorry.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2020,4,"Nice hotel, we stayed for one night.","Nice clean hotel. We stayed for the night. The riad is very nice and staff are very friendly. We only had breakfast, which is a generous buffet, and did not try any of the other services. Nice hotel would recommend for a short stay.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2020,1,Horrible visit,"DID NOT FEEL SAFE. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU VALUE PRIVACY. The people who work here are some of the least customer-service oriented staff I’ve ever encountered in my life. From the check-in, to the room service, to the housekeeping, it seems like they don’t even know common courtesy. For example, the housekeeper came in this morning at 8:05am without even knocking. My friend and I were fast asleep and she just barged in and woke us both up and asked if we want our room done. Excuse me? The do not disturb sign was on the door. It’s just unbelievable how much of a lack of training all the staff has. For a hotel that has been around for a hundred years, I’m not sure they’re going to make it even 100 more days... DO NOT STAY HERE.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2019,3,"Hotel is fine, spa was awful","El Minzah hotel was a nice property, the room itself was comfortable and it had a nice balcony. Staff was helpful, though they did mess up our wake up call. The food was very good at the Wine Bar. Our main complaint was the spa, we schedule a 45 min couple massage. They brought us to a room and left us waiting for 10 mins, we almost got up, the woman who massaged me basically just rubbed me with baby oil. They then shorted us 15 mins of our massage, and told us to take our time getting up, though one of the masseuses, came over to me and rerubbed my shoulders and head for a min or two, saying that the other woman doesn't know how to give a massage and that she's not trained. When we told the front desk that we only got 30 mins, they went and got the untrained masseuse and she…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2019,4,Decent Hotel - fine for one night,"This was the first hotel we stayed at in our two weeks in Morocco. It was fine, not memorable, and reasonably located in a large city. I think their emphasis is more on their Spa than the hotel itself. But it was comfortable enough.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2019,5,Travel back in time to your vision of old Morocco,"El Minzah is your opportunity to travel back in time and enjoy Morocco as it was many years ago, whilst enjoying very comfortable rooms and accommodation. Enjoy you breakfast sitting in the magnificent court yard or on the back deck overlooking the harbour. The breakfast buffet has one of the widest selection of food you could ever want. If it is not on display the friendly staff will sure oblige. After breakfast wander back to your room by way of viewing all the photos of previous celebrities that line the arched passage ways. Old world charm exudes throughout the property. Ideally located close to the main shopping boulevard, the souk and the harbour, you will be in the centre of Tangier, just where you need to be.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,2,Disappointing,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at the El Minzah and were disappointed by just about everything but the balcony in our room. The supposed renovations were apparent in the newly remodeled postage stamp sized bathroom where my knees hit the bidet when using the toilet. The new flooring in our room looked and felt cheap. As said above the balcony was wonderful with a great view of the grounds. The staff was border line awful. Reception was boisterously obnoxious and neglected to tell us that most of the hotel had been taken over by a private (owners?) event that was being set up in the courtyard the first night and being held there the second night. Not knowing this, we went to the Wine Bar restaurant (after reading good TA reviews) in the courtyard that first night. We were the only…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,1,Not very clean and terrible service.,"I stayed there with a group in September for five days. Although the rooms have been ""renovated"", the hallway carpeting is filthy. Several people in our group had things stolen, including myself. My jacket and vest were stolen from the bar area. There was no wifi for most of our stay, and for a stay of 5 days I was given only one bottle of water and asked to pay for more. The spa is good and the location is excellent. However, this should never be given 5 stars it is more like a two star hotel.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,5,Great stay in Tangier,"Chose the hotel because it is a historic landmark in the center of the city. Close to the Medina and shopping. I enjoyed the stay, staff were very helpful and pleasant rooms were nicely furnished and clean. Bar by the pool was a great place to relax. Breakfast was good. Restaurant was excellent with entertainment included. It was pricier than other places but I personally wouldn’t have stayed anywhere else. The only small suggestion is that the carpets in the hallways be replaced as their used looks didn’t make justice to the rest of the place. Had a great stay. Would return gladly.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,3,We went for lunch,"Lunch was lovely, away from the crowds with a lovely view of the hotel’s pool. Delicious fresh fish and friendly service. We visited the Legation right afterwards, so its a perfect spot on the day make that visit. Otherwise, probably not worth going out of your way for!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,5,Top class.,"We turned up hours early to check in, and it wasn't any issue. Upgraded to a suite on check in. Everything was great in the hotel, bar and pool were excellent. Couldn't be happier that we chose to stay here.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2019,3,Good location if you’re visiting Medina but definitely not 5*,"Location near the Grand Soco and Place de France. The hotel is a bit of a labyrinth. We had a normal street view room, which was rather small but practical. Beds were comfortable, on Saturday night there was a lot if street noise, up to 5:30 am! Breakfast was good but basic: only Moroccan rolls, no selection of breads eg whole wheat not there. No menu option and am not sure if a custom made omelette is possible. Cold meats are local and from the color of it, not worth the try. Breakfast room has a nice terrace but no shade. Swimming pool is set in a beautiful garden, a luxury downtown Tangier. However the pool boy should be briefed about his role... he was reluctant to give us 2 towels. Plenty of lounge chairs were empty but still had towels on them. Not customer friendly! We…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2019,3,Nice but...,Overall nice hotel and a most of the staff are very helpful... Apart from the evening reception staff. Everything seemed to be difficult for them to assist with. Shame as this is really the main thing that lets the rest of the team down. Restaurant is nice and a safe bet for food. The rooms are well kept and the cleaning staff are thorough with multiple visits during the day. Breakfast has a good selection that will satisfy most peoples needs. Spa hammam was great. Hotel location is good for most things of interest. Good for families as all facilities including a pool.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2019,4,Good hotel,Our stay at El Minzah was reasonably good. It is an old hotel with lots of memories and I am sure was a really popular hotel for celebrities past. I loved the architecture. Staff were so so. The location is convenient and busy. We enjoyed the coffee at Cafe du Paris which is just down the road. Overall an enjoyable stay in Tangier.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 June 2019,5,Classic and Historic,"The El Minzah has been recently renovated, and has managed to keep its historic charm and have all modern amenities. The staff are welcoming and helpful, the pool and spa are beautiful, the food is excellent, and it’s in a great location!

I’m back again in Morocco for business and was really pleased that my work booked me at the El Minzah. They’ve just reopened after remodeling and it looks great. The same charm and beauty and the same attentive and caring staff. It’s in such a great area for seeing the wonders of Tangier.

 September 2017,5,Stunning Retro Hotel,We really enjoyed visiting Tangier and Morocco. This hotel was a lovely older hotel it is well kept and very accessible. A beautiful view and grounds. We shared a wonderful meal and entertainment in their bar and enjoyed the breakfast selections in the breakfast buffet every morning. We found the staff very friendly and they helped us find a guide to take us through the city's market and off to the blue city the next day. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2017,5,What a shame,I have given Five Stars based on when I stayed there. However that was very nearly forty years ago and it really was fabulous. But forty years is a long time and you need to keep investing to stay great. What a real shame to hear it has closed - I guess I cannot expect a hotel to stay open waiting for me to go back and certainly I cannot expect it to survive on the savings from my small budget all those yeas ago.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2018,1,Made reservations but have not been communicated with about closure.,"I made reservations for July 2018 way back in January, and have received no communications regarding the closure of the hotel.

 February 2018,3,Refurbishment needed,"Spent 3 night for business purposes. The rooms are ok size with great amenities, however everything starts to look old and some refurbishment would be quite good. What is pretty unbelievable is that when breakfast starts you have almost nothing available and full breakfast service isn’t available until 30 minutes passed The best thing of the hotel is internet what is very fast and great if you have to work and the different restaurants within the hotel, but it’s insufficient to compensate the expectation for a 5* hotel which used to be the reference in town",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2018,4,Moroccan Charm at its Best!,"Loved loved this hotel. Perfectly located close to the central Medina, close to the seaside. This hotel was so charming because of its old world Moroccan decor and flavor. Classic elegance. Our room was facing the sea with a little terrace and it was very nice. The hotel is being shut down for a few months as they are going to upgrade the actual rooms but will be keeping the beautiful ambience. The staff was as nice and friendly as can be... Since it was my birthday.. they even came up to my room and sang me Happy Birthday with a fabulous cake! Breakfast in the morning was beautifully served in the main dining area with a wonderful view of the sea. I would definitely stay here again... Just beautiful and a great rate as well!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 October 2017,4,Oasis in downtown Tangier,"The El Minzah has a great location central to all the major sites in Tangier and just a stones throw from the central Medina. The hotel itself I would describe as classic, old world charm with lots of staff, great service overall. We had suites with views of the harbour, very picturesque. The rooms were starting to show their age but still comfortable. We availed of the hotel restaurant and bar. Both were good. We also attended a somewhat cheesy belly dancing show put on by the hotel over dinner. The walls of the courtyard are filled with pictures of famous guests. We had our won brush with fame while we were staying here, contestants from the Amazing Race were staying at the hotel with their film crew, we had a brief chat with them over Breakfast go green team.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 August 2017,4,An Oasis in the busy city,We stayed two days and my travel partner returned for another two when he didn't like the Raid we booked. I believe the rooms have been updated. It has a great pool wich only fault is it closes at 5pm. While the dinner menu is expensive they offer a Moroccan and a European version. It was lovely sitting out on the quite balcony in the evening. The inner patio was also nice! Lovely breakfast! The hotel still has an era of grandeur. Some of the front staff felt a bit pushy but I think it was more of a cultural divide. Close to the Medina and a nice square to watch the men coming out of the mosques from the call of prayer. We would defiantly return to El Minzah.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,1,Run down and nobody cares!!,"Arrived with a group, the staff were not impressed to serve a large group. Our suitcases were very late to arrive to our rooms.Most people went to find their own. Organised group dinner where there were not enough large tables set up.Some of our group had to sit on their own. Meals came to our bus driver and tour director before many of our group.Aussies need drink service ASAP. Staff were very blasé and really didn't care that we wanted drinks with our meals. We were then asked to finalise our bills before the end of dinner and we could not charge to our room!!! Noisy location there must be better options in Tangers! Very disappointed overall.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,1,Rich historical history but a little run down,"Yes, many famous people like Churchill stayed here but it needs a renovation. The air conditioners did not work in our room or our friends. It was desperately hot in the rooms and the noise from the street prevented us from opening our windows. Lovely pool and breakfast terrace, but Food was so-so. There was very tight security with X-ray machines in the lobby. Upon leaving to the port, desperate children just out side the hotel gate tried to jump onto our coach and even threw a concrete bollard at the bus. It was extremely tragic to watch as they ran after our coach and hung on to the back hoping to hide underneath the coach and escape to Spain. The neighbourhood is dicey, we were warn not to turn right outside the entrance and only go left. I wonder want would have happened…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,3,Authentically Moroccan,"In the middle of town you arrive at this hotel on a super busy street ... it's vibrant. Step inside and you will be somewhere authentically Moroccan . The building has a sense of the romantic . The exposed wood, the heavy curtains, the paintings, photographs ... it really is an amazing building. It's a bit shabby which stops one from falling completely in love with it. Service was not great as my luggage sat in the lobby for well over an hour . The air conditioner has seen better days and I am sure it actually worked on those days . The food was lacking. This hotel has potential to shine - but I am afraid it skips in and out of the shadows.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,1,Tired and disappointing,"We got bumped from our orginal hotel to this place while on a tour - it was terrible. The food at dinner was terrible basically inedible so we walked out half way through and had a drink in the bar instead. Breakfast was meant to be ready at 5.30am it wasn't so we manged to grab a croissant but no coffee, toast or hot food. The rooms are tiny and very sad - we had two single beds like something from the 70's. We were meant to get a wake up call at 5am we got it a 5.20am when we had to have bags out at 5.30am. Would never stay here again.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,3,What a shame😔,"My husband and I stayed in Al minzah hotel for 2 nights in our first visit to Tangier. This hotel is very different in its good and bad things. The location is great; right in the centre. The decor is as if you walked into an old story. Loved it. We booked a room with balcony and the view was nice. There is no tea and coffee facilities in the room though. Now to the things which ruined our visit. 1. Started with the porter who took our luggage to the room and gave me a horrible look because he wasn't happy with the tip. Then he ignored my request to send someone to empty the minibar to put my water and fruit. 2. The door of the room was broken. We were not able to lock the room when leaving!!! They failed to fix it. 3. The worst with the breakfast. It starts at 7, so they say.…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

This hotel was one of the best values on my 2 month trip abroad. Ask for private tour guide named ""MoMo"". The front desk referred this animated 35 year guide to us, and it made the trip awesome!!!!!

 May 2017,2,Disappointing again,"Last year I had dinner here and it was a dreadful experience. We had to send our food back as it was cold and vegetables not cooked. We passed by the hotel again when recently visiting Tangier and decided to have tea on the terrace. We walked onto the terrace to find several table strewn with dirty cups and saucers, tableclothes with crumbs on and no one around to clear it. We sat at one of the tables and waited, and waited. Finally had to call a waiter over who wasnt particularly friendly - we asked for tea. He cleared the table and came back quite a long time later with mint tea, we didnt want mint tea - he said they don't have Liptons tea!! (so what happens at breakfast!?). The staff seemed pretty miserable, unlike the sister hotel Grand Hotel Ville de France…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

You can even have a beer. I would love to go back!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2017,4,"A time warp - come with nostalgia, not modern expectations","This Grande Dame of yesteryear has seen better days, but if you are after some kitsch nostalgia for 1950s and 1960s literary and Hollywood scene seeking out the exotic in small doses, this place is charming. Yes, the cheap curtains are faded and the decor is dated, but it is part of the charm. The service is decent (sometimes lovely), but generally distant and unaware of modern norms, as though they are the ghosts of their 1950s selves. The hotel feels like a ghost town with few guests, but that may be because of Ramadan. If visiting Tangier again, I would consider staying at one of the riads that have been transformed by European families - depending on whether I feel like dealing with their stairs.

 May 2017,4,Lovely classic Moroccan hotel,"A friend recommended El Minzah and we're glad he did. It's like an oasis after the hustle and bustle of the markets. The detail and filigree designs are gorgeous and a delight to see all around the hotel. Our room had a large balcony looking out to sea. Plenty of choice at breakfast with hot options, crepes, breads, cereals, meats, cheeses, yoghurt, watermelon, figs, dates, pastries, etc. with fresh coffee or tea. Waiters are in pantaloons complete with a Fez. A short walk to the medina and Saveur de Poisson restaurant. Definitely a 4 star and close to a 5.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 May 2017,1,Worst massage and spa ever experienced - complete rip off!!,"After reading great things about El Minzah wellness in several guidebooks, I decided to book a 60 minute relaxation massage for my birthday while in Tangier. WORST DECISION EVER. I arrived 10 minutes in advance of my 15:00 appointment as was suggested and was taken upstairs. All the lights were off, not in a charming spa-like way with candles, but just off completely as if they were trying to save money, Then the woman couldn't close the curtain so the room directly looked out onto a busy street with people looking in. There were no blankets or sheets on the massage table save for a beach towel. As I was getting undressed the woman just walked in and waited for me to finish. I lay on the table and she poured a massive amount of oil on me and then just proceeded to rub it up…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2016,5,Home away from home! And..THE destination in Tangier if you drive an electric vehicle!!,"We love this grand hotel from a magnificent past, full of atmosphere and character! Our stay in december 2016 was our second stay with them, on this occassion driving (potentially!) the first elelectric vehicle over the High Atlas mountains of Morocco (more details online)! The hotel perfectly accommodated our need to charge this electric vehicle, providing us with a 3kW Schuko socket, and indeed they really should be the default stay-over destination for every EV driver, since they have the right charging equipment, on top of the high-quality service. The staff at reception, in the restaurants, laundry service, the house technician, even the guide who was recommended (Said) were all really great &last (but not least!), the Hotel Manager was very friendly and approachable.

 April 2017,5,A 5 star hotel for $80 a night!,"On the internet it was advertised as a 3 star hotel and at $80 including breakfast , it seemed ideal for us as we would only be going there to plop down for the night. There was a doorman dressed in typical elegant Morrocon attire to greet us and the lobby took our breath away- as elegant as any hotel in Las Vegas, with beautiful artistic , elaborate tiles. Clean as a whistle and beautiful furniture all around, we were led to our room and were stunned by the layout. Walked over to the large window to see part of Tangiers and the ocean! The view alone was worth the price but after a comfortable night, the breakfast in the palatial dining room was incredible! All kinds of fresh fruits and juices, croissants and bread to die for and coffee whose smell blew us away! The waiters were…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 May 2016,5,If you want the full experience this is a great choice,"Really enjoyed everything about my stay here. The real experience may be less ideal but you get all you would imagine behind the walls of this lovely old hotel. The rooms are really clean, with great air-conditioning and romantic blinds over-looking beautiful views. You feel like you have been transported back in time. I love the dark accents against the white stucco with flowers everywhere. Especially beautiful are the nearby markets easy to find, and then returning, you can sit by the pool and enjoy a cool drink before going to the great restaurant for dinner and watching the live shows. Nothing about this is too touristy or obvious, it's done exactly right. Very much a bygone era and that's why it works.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2017,5,Classic Eupropean and Moroccan elegance,"A famous old classic spanish/Moroccan style hotel with thick walls and high ceilings. It is a huge hotel with 2 huge dining rooms, a patio, 2 bars and who knows what else. Didn't see a pool but I think there is one. Service was excellent. The staff was there to please, and spoke great English. I guess this was a 5 star hotel that had dropped in the ratings and now a new owner is trying to edge it back up in the age of Trip Advisor. It worked to our benefit because we were able to stay there for a fraction of what it would have cost in it's heyday. Everything about the place was luxurious and a bit worn out, which we liked. Our room was spacious, reasonably priced and had a great view of the bay. The luxurious Moroccan restaurant even had live musicians playing groovy,…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2017,3,Taste of Morocco's Romantic 1950's Era,"Not much exciting to do in Tangier, but had to go for business. Stayed at this hotel which apparently hasn't changed much in 50 years. Well maintained, but needs to be refreshed - starting to look a little tired. Either way, it was a cool place. The pool was gorgeous, the bar, somewhat lively with Karaoke singers and a very friendly staff. Also well located only minutes from the port and from the Souk. Did this hotel blow me away? No, but I would stay here again if the need arose. Get a glimpse of the romantic Moroccan lifestyle from days gone by! Breakfast was okay - but the view from the terrace was gorgeous - especially in the early AM when eating breakfast.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2017,5,Great hotel!,"Stayed here in Jan. 2017. Lovely hotel - older but still First Class for me! The service was unbelievable.

 January 2017,5,A place I will always return to,"A hotel with old world charm, professional and friendly staff, located in the heart of Tangier. I hope they don't ""reform"" it.

It is now a 3 star hotel officially. See photo of the plaque outside the hotel taken today (Plaque says Le Royal it is the EL MINZAH hotel.) The hotel staff is in a state of chaos as well.

 January 2017,5,Returned for New Year celebrations,"I have stayed in this hotel several times before and a previous visit over New Year made me want to come again. The hotel offers great service and has some nice rooms. I was recognised from my previous visit! The New Year's Eve dinner or for the Fete de San Sylvester is a long dinner with good food and entertainment. Diners are summoned down by a band of Atlas Mountain musicians to Champagne in the quadrangle before being ushered in to seats in the dining room. A further traditional band played and sang during the meal. Breakfast was available in the dining room (transformed back overnight) with a huge selection of foods, including traditional Moroccan fare.

 June 2016,5,Amazing hotel,"We were here for only one night, but it was beautiful. We visited during Ramadan, which meant that finding a cocktail was not so easy, but the Moroccan tea more than made up for that.

 October 2016,4,Fun and interesting,This was our family's first experience with Morocco. The hotel was exceptional.. except: we coordinated transportation through the hotel prior to arrival.. just to be safe. Our family normally 'wings it' so we were excited to have a driver with our name on a sign waiting for us after customs. When we loaded up in the cab it became apparent that there was a driver but also another individual. Having read all of the trip advisor warnings about being 'fleeced' in Tangier my spidy senses were to tingling. The extra passenger in our cab began informing us of all the various things we saw on the ride from the airport to the hotel. Nothing we really cared to hear at this point as we had gotten the gang moving at two am for a six am take off out of Brussels and an eight am arrival…,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2016,1,Worst Service at the Bar!,"This place needs a complete management overhaul. We had drinks at the piano bar last week and the drinks were ridiculously overpriced and minuscule (I have the most minimalist vodka & tonic ever - it was like a Donald Judd creation). The service, however, was the worst. We waited for ever to order and the waiter disappeared after bringing us the drinks. We had to pay at the counter and they had some problems ringing the bill, so we just stood there while the manager (I assume that's what he was) took forever to calculate the bill for two drinks. The hotel appeared run down, with a vague smell of mold. Given the service experience, I would never recommend staying at this place - especially the high room prices.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2016,5,Nice drinks,"I didn't spend any night in the hotel but I used to visit it in order to enjoy some drinks with my friends in the open area.

 October 2016,2,Tired and dated,"The former grande-dame of Tangiers' hotels just lost 2 of its 5-stars, quite deservedly. It has lost its lustre. Rooms are in various states of disrepair, lots of knicks and scratches, service is spotty and the staff are on edge. It needs a new investor and an infusion of cash for a proper renovation. My dinner tonight in their Moroccan restaurant was a rip-off. I asked for a dry white wine by the glass and they made me pay for the whole bottle. Crafty waiter - like a villain out of an Agatha Christie novel. The entertainment was cheesy - with an overweight and jiggly belly dancer and guy with a tray of candles on his head. Surely entertaining for the bus groups that now frequent the hotel, but not for high-end tourists. Avoid it for the not perfect but better sister…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The room was a good size and very nicely decorated with hidden lights and elaborate furnishings. You could not hear any noise from the hallways or other rooms. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food was excellent and gave us a sample of their cuisine.

Although, Tangier the beautiful city in Morocco and definitely worth visiting but make sure that this place is where you stay at for its welcoming staff, perfect location, nice sea views and the excellent service. You would also enjoy at this hotel the lovely breakfast in a beautiful inside/outside area and the tasty evening dinner in the fabulous entertaining atmosphere.

I was not disappointed and really enjoyed my stay. Of course there are now so many new and modern hotels in the city but the El Minzah has a special charm which sets it apart. Very good and discreet service from all the staff - front desk, housekeeping and restaurant - combined with the, perhaps slightly faded, beauty of the place won me over once again. Breakfast and dinner at the hotel were just excellent with, like from my room, a splendid view over the bay. Aside from the sea view, the place reminds me so much of the Palais Jamai in Fes.

A piano bar/restaurant for breakfast/lunch/dinner with 2 patios, one overlooking the ocean and another overlooking the large swimming pool. There is another Moroccan style restaurant which features traditional performances at night. I did not ventured into the wine bar and a seperate building which houses (I presume)the spa and gym.

It's true things are a bit dated in terms of decor but that is part of the wonderful charm. I disagree with those who say the service is poor. For us, it was wonderfully attentive and friendly at every level, alternating in four languages as it suited our needs, and they couldn't have been more welcoming. It's true they aren't all over you at your immediate need in the moment but that is part of the ""enjoy the moment"" culture. No hurry. No worry.

The El Minzah is located in Rue de la Liberte, wonderfully positioned next to all the places and restaurants you will need on your itinerary. The room was lovely, the staff courteous and attentive, the breakfast wonderful.

Had it been a 3* I may have rated it higher or at least average. Because that is what El Minza is, a (low) 3*. There is nothing reminiscent of a 5* here. From the hotel it's self, to the staff, the service, the food... All of it is awful! I have been unfortunate enough to have been here for almost 5 weeks and in that time I feel I can give a good overview. So the rooms: I feel I have been comparatively lucky compared to others who have stayed here, my mini bar was cold although not always stocked (poor choice as well) ✅ My air con worked✅ The view out to sea was quite nice ✅ My water pressure for he shower and bath was fine ✅ Bed linen is terrible ❌ Pillows are rock solid and too large ❌…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The location is right in the heart of the port city very close to the entrance of the medina which is in walking distance. Upon entering you definitely feel like you are taken back to the romantic past of tangiers when writers, celebrities, and expats would stay here to escape. A very beautiful and Large hotel with hallways adorned in ornate light fixtures, beautiful red carpet and dark wooden doors give it a feeling of going back in time as if you can feel the old era speaking to you.

Then the gym had no AC, no water, no fan, and no towels, and two guys who are gym employees but did literally nothing but look at their phones. They didn't even greet me. Then when I asked for water I found i had to go all the way back down to reception and pay 10 more dirhams for this.

 June 2016,3,The old chic of Tanger`s past is gone,"Three friends and I spent a night at the El Minzah which was once known as one if not the finest and most charming hotel in Tanger. But these times are long gone. The relatively small rooms where we stayed were located on the third floor and offered a nice view of the nearby port but this was about the only thing positive about the rooms. At a cost of almost US $ 100 per single room this was certainly not a bargain for Marocco, although the buffet breakfast which was included in the price of the room was excellent and one of the best breakfasts which we had in Marocco. This cannot however be said about the mediocre US $ 25 evening buffet dinner at the first night of Ramadan. What we really liked at this hotel were their beautiful gardens and the swimming pool.

 May 2016,3,Very Average,Hotel is in a nice location close to the Medina with every convenience in walking distance. It is a very old building which is kept in good condition. The room was average. One thing I expected in a hotel of this standard is a complimentary bottle of water in the room which was missing. The room was clean but the keys seemed to be reset every day which meant walking back to reception every evening to get the Key reset. I saw others getting Keys reset too. The breakfast was adequate with a nice selection. Had dinner in the restaurant one evening which was nice but expensive for the area.

It was always ""The"" hotel in Tangier. I was here for a weekend and stayed at its sister hotel nearby, Villa de France. A friend and I decided to have dinner at El Minzah. The restaurant was deserted so we ended up in the bar for more atmosphere. We order roast chicken which took ages to come and when it did it was cold. Cold food served on a cold plate, roast chicken and vegetables?

 May 2016,3,In its day probably a very good hotel,"Stayed one night on business. First visit. Good, central location. Easy to access by taxi. Check-in very efficient by very helpful staff. Room was okay. Problem with my key, but managed to get in. Dark corridors. Nice view of the new port development and Spain in the distance. Bathroom was a good size. Comfortable bed. AC switches were missing, but I managed to get the system to work. Wifi was not good. Didn't watch tv, so can't comment on the channel choice. Had dinner and breakfast. Didn't use the mini-bar. Dinner was good, but I didn't have wine (the wine waiter tried his hardest). Breakfast was standard with a good choice. Coffee wasn't the best. Lovely cloister and open area to sit in the evening. In summary, this is an old hotel that is showing its age. However, it still…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2016,5,Amazing service,The personnel of the hotel made our stay in Tanhier very pleasant. The room was clean and comfy. The bed is quite large and the bathroom is practical. The couscous at the restaurant was very good and the Moroccan style of the restaurant is enchanting. The location is central.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2016,3,Old charming hotel,"This hotel would have been great in its hey day but unfortunately now is quite outdated. We were on a tour and everyone had similar complaints. The wifi, aircon and/or tv wasn't working. In our room it was the wifi and aircon. We went to the bar and had a drink before dinner. €8 for a very average glass of wine. That was the most expensive drink we had on our trip. The included dinner was ok. The soup had a nice spicy kick to it. The chicken and couscous dish was very dry and bland. This was a shame as were told how great Moroccan food is. Some entertainment was included during dinner. It was a shame that the entertainment occurred while we were eating. It meant that we couldn't fully appreciate the performers or have a cold meal.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2016,3,once great now a little tired,"I stayed twice, firstly for a conference and then returned from a week away. It was like a tale of two different hotels. My first room booked directly with the hotel, was tiny and overlooked the car park. Incredibly for a city centre hotel, it had original 1950s single glazing so very noisy. Amazing bathroom with a full size bath. Room curtains didn't met in the middle either. My second room booked via Booking.com for less money was huge with a balcony, and with same old single glazing, but at least it had upgraded curtains. First check out a complete nightmare, receptionist rude and actually strongly argued and called on a waiter IN PERSON to insist I had not paid for something... I had .. No apology and lots of shouting ..before he eventually removed the charge, this…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2016,4,Magnificent,Magnificent hotel that dates back to a byegone era steeped in history but is very well maintained. Beautiful architecture throughout the ground floor of the hotel. Lovely restaurant and bars and swimming pool. We only visited the hotel but I would have loved to have stayed here for the history.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2016,4,"Great service, old charm hotel","The hotel is very well located, close to zoco and old town. Was great to get a room with fantastic views to the sea and old town. El Minzah was not what I expected as 5 star hotel, but it is an absolutely lovely place, with a lot of charm, it keeps the style and atmosphere of old days, with details and decoration. It is not new, but in a very good condition and it is cosy. The staff is very professional, friendly and helpful. The restaurant in the hotel offers a good food and as it was a weekend, we were lucky to enjoy a lovely entertaining performance. The breakfast buffet is definitively worth a visit for a good start of the day! Because of the convenient location one can get around by foot in the closest surrounding: el zoco, SPA, markets, cafes and restaurants. And when…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2016,3,"Good restaurant, nice views.","We stayed here for one night as part of a tour. The room was pretty nice, but lacked a minibar and the key lock was difficult to operate; others also had problems getting into their rooms. The wi-fi was spotty. The breakfast bar was good and the tour included a dinner and dancing show; both were pretty good. The dining room has a great view toward the town and across the Mediterranean.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 March 2016,4,Old style elegance - enjoyed our stay,"There is little to fault with the hotel, which provides old style classical elegance and is quite distinct from any chain hotel. Try and aim to have a room with a balcony that overlooks the gardens to the sea. We ate at the main restaurant on one evening, and this is first class, though eating at the bar on a separate evening was a disappointment. The buffet breakfast is as extensive as you could want.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2016,5,restaurant is terrific,"it is the oldest hotel in tangier and has a terrific location and the food is just wonderful. did not stay overnight. it has the feeling of old tangier. i didnt get alot of vegetables, so the wonderful vegetable salad they serviced was really appreciated. the other food was wonderful as well.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2015,3,Good Introduction to Morocco,"This hotel (and Tangier) was the perfect introduction to Morocco. For the very reasonable price, accommodations were nice. The decor was a bit dated, but beds were comfy, bathroom was modern and clean, and service was good. The common areas/restaurant area was very nice as well. My only complaint is not so much about the hotel itself, but about the tour service they booked for us. Upon check in, they told us they could get us a tour guide to show us around the city. Because we had heard it was easy to get lost in the medina, we agreed. But the tour was mostly him showing us stores, where ppl then tried to make us buy things. So I would definitely recommend this hotel, but would NOT recommend their on-site tour guide.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2016,3,"Old classic hotel, needs a refresh",El Minzah hotel is nice and very convenient for a stay in Tangier. Rooms to the east side are quiet and have a nice view of the harbor. Staff is friendly but hotel needs some work. They had water problems and forced us to change rooms - ended up above the bar which was noisy until 11PM which may not be a problem for many but we are early to bed and early morning risers. Heated outdoor pool was too cool to use. Internet is very slow.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2016,3,Lots of potential but needs updating,"Staff were helpful. Location is good. Breakfast was excellent. Dinner in the restaurant tastes good but service is extraordinarily slow. Expect 2-3 hours minimum to dine here. I had to have the keys in my room replaced twice and even when the keys ""worked,"" they didn't really work because you had to insert them 4-5 times. I was not the only person in my group to have this problem either, so I can only assume they need to replace these locks. The rooms are basic with old furnishings. Public areas are nice though the Moroccan custom of allowing smoking everywhere is aggravating to Americans like me who have become accustomed to not being subjected to so much smoke.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2016,4,Hotel lovely but shame about the spa,"Overall a lovely hotel and had a great stay, and the staff are a great asset to the place, and fantastic views from the rooms terrace but the one thing that lets it down is the spa, the indoor pool was absolutely freezing cold, could only bare to be in the water for one minute, so we asked to use the hammam and was told you had to book and that it was busy, asked to use the sauna and was told the same, not what you would expect for a 5 star hotel, plus communal male/female changing rooms was a strange experience, instead of spending a leisurely afternoon there as we had planned we ended up leaving after 5 minutes, such a shame because otherwise I wouldn't have found any fault in the hotel.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2016,2,Hammam review,"This was my first hammam experience so I really have nothing to compare it to, but I can comment on how it was for someone who loves a spa experience. When we called we inquired about a private hammam experience + massage for myself and my mother. We were told they had a package for DIR 400 (about £30) each for a hammam and massage (we heard 50 minutes - which was the same as other packages we were comparing to, but it turned out to be 15 minutes). We accepted as this was a 5* hotel and within walking distance to our hotel. We walked through he hotel area which was scattered with used glasses (that would be there on the return walk, as well) and noted that it was very tired and shabby looking - maybe once grand but has seen it's day. There was a lack of signage and it took…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2015,4,History and location,"We stayed here because of the history and location of the hotel. It's not what you would expect from a modern 5 star hotel, but that wasn't why we were there. While others might be disappointed we got what we paid for - which was to experience a hotel we had read so much about and had been referenced in so many novels, and to make the most of a very central location while only in Tangier for a couple of days. Nice food, service and great fresh juice at breakfast.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2016,2,Time has won,"Sure, this must have been a great hotel many years ago. Now it's dated at best. Extremely noisy (courtyard side), poor room (no work space), dated bathroom and very dated bed(!) Wifi is so so. Food is average; for all restaurants it seems to be prepared in a central kitchen. No doubt it's in the heart of town which is nice.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2015,4,3 Nights in Tangier,"We were in Tangier for 3 nights and stayed at the El Minsah. Our room was decent. The breakfast buffet was plentiful but the service during breakfast was much less than what I would expect for a hotel that claims its status. The Manager was extremely helpful and arranged for a day-long tour with someone named Moha. Moha was professional (although highly opinionated), his car was clean and safe, and he took us to the top tourist spots in the greater Tangier area.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2016,3,The Stars have dimmed at El Minzah,"We have just spent several days in Tangier at the El Minzah Hotel. I don't have any idea how this is rated as a 5 star hotel - it is 3 stars at the most. I think perhaps it may have been years ago. The common spaces are fine, but the rooms are shabby and far from luxurious and worst of all the so called amenities are sorely lacking. The room is furnished like a roadside motel. The bed is old with a thin mattress, the linens are course and look really worn and the pillows are horrible. The front desk was not helpful - when we asked to borrow a converter we were told they had none ( they did offer to buy one for us - at 3 times+ the price we bought one for ourselves later) Bottled water is not supplied, as it is in every other hotel we have stayed at in Morocco Breakfast is ok,…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2016,4,The grande lady has fantastic staff members,"Yes the hotel is old..BUT location is great..staff is fantastic...rooms very clean...take a room with terrace. Watching the harbor change is wonderful..there is much building... a new big marina is almost finished. cruise ships dock right here and the fast ferries to Spain leave from here. Breakfast is excellent. The wine bar is the most fun..small snacks and great local wines..Most resturants do not serve wine or beer...The star of the hotel is ""Momo"" the tour guide that is always at the hotel..Dressed in traditional dress and has a great sense of humor...he know the history and stories of everything.. The city is safe, clean,and very little begging. I stayed a week..next time I am going for 2 weeks",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2015,3,"Very nice hotel, if only rooms could match.","I've stayed here a couple times now, taking the ferry from Tarifa to Tangier. The hotel is in great location if you want to go and really explore the city, such as the food markets and the shopping. The hotel is beautiful with very nice views and nice pool. The staff was fairly helpful and mostly everyone spoke very good english. The rooms however i believe need a bit of an upgrade, they don't seem very new nor give that clean feeling you like to get when going into bed. However when the morning comes about, i would for sure go to their buffet, it was amazing!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2015,5,The wine bar,"They have this fantastic wine bar managed by a young gentleman, Adnan!

 February 2015,3,Fun but beware! Atmospheric hotel but untrustworthy management,"Imagine Chateau Marmont in Tangier. Old school Hollywood glamour but very decayed. Has oodles of shabby charm. But beware, questionable staff & dodgy food. Tried to palm us off into a twin room and the driver they organised abandoned us in Tetuaon after demanding an extortionate price, Great pool and an oasis from the stress of a city resting on its bohemian past. Enjoy the time warp, but don't rely on Camus-esque bell boys. They'll smoke a cigarette over their mother's own dead body.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 January 2015,5,Iconic and Wonderful,"What a lovely comforting hotel that welcomed us back after a quarter century. It is still just as iconic and perfectly located. Tangier never seems to attract the attention of travelers from the US or Europe, but it offers such a fantastic variety of food, cultural landmarks and terrific Morrocan/Euro style. To be there at new years was a delight. The staff at the El Minzah are caring and attentive. It's a big old hotel and I loved every bit of that old world feel in the heart of the city. Don’t miss Le Saveur Du Poussin a few steps away - perhaps one of the most perfect meals in the city.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2015,3,Great history,This hotel is situated city centre Tangrr. Near the Medina and the old port. Several nights I stayed here. The traditional restaurant is nice. Traditional moroccan music and nice couscous and tajinnes. The barman makes nice cocktails and they have good music. Too expensive and not worth 5 stars.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2015,4,Great local look,My friend recommended this hotel after living in Morocco for 2 years. We stayed here for the first part of our honeymoon. It's very historic and in the heart of the city...walking distance from the old part of town and the new town. I found the front desk concierges to be super helpful...they set up tours for us and were very accomodating. The room was historic and had a lot of charm.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2015,4,"Old world charm, heart of the city",This hotel is well situated just outside of the medina and casbah. Our room had stunning views of the Mediterranean! Only complaint of the hotel is that the cuisine is not very authentic. Pool was closed while we were there which was unfortunate.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2015,4,Good hotel but high rate,"Good hotel near the new city center good service and free wifi, very expensive, room facilities to old, view of balcony very nice silent, you have to negotiate for everything to make it low price, no water no coffee machine n room, helpful reception",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2015,4,Classic and Artistic,"Best place to be in Tangier, probably. They keep the antiques and the atmosphere to near perfect. The hotel itself is maintained like old palace like with beautiful bar, dining place (which is open one) and also the morocco food section where you get to hear the Sufi like live music and the belly dancer; on Monday it was only me and my friend so it became like private and grand experience!. There are lot of positives including the view from room. Unfortunately at this time the pool was not operational and one improvement needed is the respondent at the reception; many a times for me the person was missing. Coming in steps was like Maze experience as you easily get confused with the structure… but I enjoyed it. This is very conveniently placed near all good places to go for…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2015,4,Very good dinner with efficient delightful service in a great atmosphere,One of the most beautiful place I visited in Tangiers.The dinner was extremely nice with live Moroccan music and dancers. Very nice sofa for seating and perfect efficient and nice service. We had a Lamb couscous for 4 people and a pastilla dessert with cream. A really good Coteaux de l'Attlas red wine and mint thea.

 October 2015,4,Trip down memory lane,"Spent many happy days at the swimming pool of this hotel as a child. The Minzah still has a lot of charm, nice friendly staff and comfortable large rooms with a big bathroom (paid a little extra for the Deluxe room with great views of the Tangier Bay).

I would like to have stayed longer but we had to catch the ferry back to Spain",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2015,2,Worn out in sad neglect,"We stayed in this hotel during july in 2015. Strongly let down after having heard so much of the place. Very expensive rates for the quality of the stay, which is 3 star at best. The beds are old and the mattresses squeaky. Wifi doesnt work in half the hotel. No privacy in the hotel pool which is open to non guests for a low fee. Would recommend alternatives if you can plan ahead, which we could not so we ended up stuck in here.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2015,4,A night in Tangier,We only had an overnight stop before taking the ferry to Spain but the room was comfortable and clean. I had by now worked out that hotel rooms in Morocco are generally small with only single beds. The staff were helpful especially the doorman. WiFi is available but again Morocco struggles with reliable service.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2015,2,Stuck in 1970,"I was expecting a lot from this Hotel but unfortunately was disappointed. It's in a great location and it has a lot of charm in it's common areas but the room I got was really small and outdated. Charm is one thing but old is something else, it felt like they had redone it in 1970 and never changed a thing again, including the WC. The only thing nice about the room was the terrace. The bed was also of poor quality and with cheap pillows, surely not a 5 star thing. The staff was very nice except for the person in the reception on my arrival that insisted on me getting a guide and that I should go for lunch at a restaurant he recommended in the Medina that was terrible, expensive and full of tourists sent there. He is clearly getting paid by the restaurant to send people there...…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 September 2015,4,Old World Charm,"this hotel is old and beautiful. The dark wool is stunning and the rooms, though small, were nice. They were clean except for the doors which could have used a good dusting. Ours overlooked the street but we didn't notice a lot of street noise. We had dinner in the restaurant and it was good.

 August 2015,2,Manager is unhelpful and dishonest,"The hotel is great for tourists and old city fanatics. I wouldn't recommend the hotel for family travelers and/or elders due the design of the hotel with lots of stairs especially if they put you in the bottom floor Rooms 52-58 (you have to go up the stairs and then go down again!). We had to ask for a higher floor that is more accessible for family members with knee issues! The first night they said they are sold out and we have to take what they assigned to us (which by the way they full charged us without approval from us prior to arrival due to an issue with the booking site) but ironically after we spoke to another gentlemen (Ahmed) who was very helpful and understandable - they gave us another room on the first floor.

The hotel eould need some updated and refurbushments but it is charming and clean. The pool area is great. The breakfast was very boring and the restaurants to be avoided - many more exciting options for dinner around the corner.

 May 2015,5,Beautiful Hotel with Good Breakfast Buffet,"We stayed here one night as part of a Globus Tour. Our room 135 had a harbor view but no balcony. However, there were plenty of beautiful courtyards and patios around the hotel in which to sit and enjoy a drink, (expect to pay about $6 for beer or wine), as well as a really nice pool area. Photos of the famous people who stayed here line the walls. The hotel is in a great location right down the street from the Grand Socco. There is also a show in the restaurant at 9:30 p.m. with musicians and belly dancers.

We ordered two glasses of white wine and they brought a small bottle, enough for two servings + in a silver urn with ice. Our server helped us with the menu and we settled on traditional Moroccan dishes. The first course was a platter of olives, cucumbers, zucchini, carrots, beets, lettuce and pepper. Second course was a Tanjine of couscous over beef with large steamed vegetables. All was nicely presented and dished up by our servers.

 May 2015,4,Old World Hotel w/ all the Quarks.,"This is not a 5* property but you can see it's past glory. I decided to give them a 4* review because of the atmosphere. It took us three days to get into the groove of the place and when we did we we found the we like it. The service was impeccable, the bar has piano music and they serve free appetizers with a bottle of wine, the front desk is quick to help with all of your needs (including exchanging currency) and it's located one block from the Medina. In the end we were lucky and we ran into several old time ex-pats that call Tangier home. they showed us how to slow down and enjoy a lazy morning that runs into an afternoon.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2015,4,Renovation needed,"This is my second time in this hotel, I came in 2001 and here I am back after 14 years. The hotel has a very nice location and nice view. Staff are very very nice and helpful. love the morrocon restaurant in the hotel it's very good. The breakfast buffet is good with wide variaties. However the hotel needs renovation keeping the same style. Rooms are clean. Rooms size is the average. I would recommend this hotel only after renovation.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2015,4,Class and elegance,"A family group of six of us visited the hotel for dinner one evening & had a good experience. The couscous royal was a feast and the mojito (non alcoholic mint&lemon) was superb. My daughter (in her 20s!) had the mojito with rum & pronounced that delicious too. The ambience was relaxed, we ate at a huge table with sofas on 3 sides and room for 8-10 people. There were only 2 tables taken that evening, another group of 8 at next table. There was authentic live music throughout the evening. The waiters are very capable and attentive, but not subservient. The head waiter was a real character & teased my daughter that she had ordered fish before uncovering the tagine with a theatrical flourish to reveal her lamb dish. There was belly dancing (one dance each by 2 different ladies)…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2015,5,Bags of Character,"My partner and I stayed for one night at the El Minza Hotel in Tangier travelling with a group through Morocco. The hotel has a great deal of history with regards to famous guests who have stayed over many years. This is reflected in the array of photographs displayed in various public rooms. Our room, a double, was of a fair size and like the accompanying en-suite bathroom, was very clean. The outlook was over a rather dingy street rather than the courtyard or the gardens but we found it more interesting watching the coming and going of the locals below the window. We were staying on a half-board basis and dinner was self-service. Some of the waiters appeared to be pre-occupied so it initially was hard to get drinks but the food was excellent so this tempered the…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2015,4,Time Warp in Tangier,"This is a trip to the past and an oasis in a bustling town. The staff are multilingual, friendly and extremely helpful.

 April 2015,5,Elegant and exquisite at El Minzah,I have traveled all over Europe. This is my first time to Morocco. This hotel is magical. It has the feel of a resort that has every possible amenity. But it doesn't feel cheesy like a destination. The culture and heritage of Tangier is ripe within this hotel. The staff is phenomenal. The room has amazing view and gorgeous furnishings. The breakfast buffet is absolutely perfect. If you read a bad revie. It is likely the person hasn't traveled much in countries like this. To be somewhere like Morocco and complain about this hotel says a lot about a person's inability to understand the world. Staying here is a fortunate experience for anyone.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 April 2015,1,Dreadful,"It is a great shame when a hotel with a respected, historical reputation so blatantly rests on its laurels. This is 5* at its worst: the smug, arrogant and lazy attitude of the reception staff; the lack of bath products in the bathroom; the broken shower and bathroom door; the absence of refreshments in the room; the appalling quality of the sheets and pillows; the badly hung curtains that don't meet in the middle. I have stayed in plenty of 2 and 3 * hotels where their standards and attitudes to customer care have exceeded the El Minzah by far. A great shame.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2015,5,Charming Hotel,"M husband and i have just arrived from staying at El Minzah Hotel and i must say that everyone made us feel very welcomed, The staff were very attentive and always willing to help. The waiters made our stay extra special by going out of their way in tending to our every whim. We enjoyed dining at the restaurant, listening to the music and the belly dancer.

 March 2015,4,Classic hotel - great location.,"This hotel was recommended for a recent stay in Tangier. The hotel is located close to the French Embassy and the local markets. There is also a great seafood place around the corner. The hotel itself has a old world charm and decorations. The rooms are quiet and relaxing. On the first night, I enjoyed dinner in the restaurant. Service, food and the live music were all excellent. I found the staff to be courteous and very pleasant. My understanding is new owners have taken over the facility and replaced some of the staff. Everyone one I spoke with spoke excellent English and made my stay enjoyable. My future trips to Tangier will include a stay here.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2014,3,I think Don Draper left his swim trunks here...,"My husband and I visited this hotel during our stay for lunch one afternoon in Tangier. I thought it was fun to visit and almost made me feel like I was some character out of Mad Med on holiday in Morocco. This, if you read between the lines, translates to a hotel stuck in a bygone era. And, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. It’s a little on the uppity side and I would not say that any of the staff were particularly helpful. To be fair, we were not staying there, only dining, so perhaps they didn’t have any real incentive to make us feel welcome. We had a table on the terrace overlooking the pool. There were a few other patrons – seemingly guests of the hotel – dining or laying out by the pool. It appeared to be an older crowd who might be the kind to extend their…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2014,2,Appalling Service,"My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in June. The hotel is rated 5 stars although I would say it is a 4 star at best. It is dated and slightly shabby. The rooms themselves were comfortable. The bed was large and I slept very well. However I would never return to this hotel due to the awful staff. They are sullen and rude, one breakfast waiter actually shouted at us just because he could not understand what we were saying. Wait staff refused to serve me unless I was with my male partner. A simple request for mayonnaise was denied, apparently it was taking long because the chef was making it from scratch but it never came. The pool staff tried to give us used towels. The list goes on. Put simply, avoid this hotel, stay the The Mirage.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2015,5,A grand old lady,"I always loved this hotel and still do. It has a charm all of its own, good service, beautiful pool, now a new spa wellness center, and it is in the best location, a short walk from the Medina. I have stayed with my two kids in a suite overlooking the bay: unbeatable vista! Lunch around the pool offers delicious fish, and breakfast buffet comes with crepes and mint tea...

 August 2014,4,Massage in Tangier,"El Minzah Hotel is an oasis of peace and tranquillity in a busy city. We stayed two nights. My wife had the best massage she had ever had in the Spa. The Hotel really is iconic, 1940s atmosphere contrasting the chaos of the Medina and Kasbah. Everyone was really helpful. The town is an adventure at night, loads of locals crowding the streets and cafes. Great for people watching. Check your ferry times, we nearly missed ours back to Tarifa.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2015,5,A memorable getaway,Stayed here for one night and will certainly be back! The staff all lovely. The food in the Moroccan restaurant was delicious.

Loved every minute!,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2014,5,Excellent!,We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend during the summer. I have stayed here before many times as a young child and it holds a charm which many hotels with modernisation have lost! It is perfectly situated near the Souk and centre.

Totally recommend it!,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

It feels like an old shoe, very very comfortable.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2015,2,Past It's Best.,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel. We arrived on a cold foggy night, no hot drink greeted us, but we were just wanting to get to our room as the foyer was really cold and smelling quite stale. We were taken along narrow corridors that were lined by dark brown rafia making them look dark and uninviting. Our rooms were small and dark nothing like the bright and airy veiws you can see on the website. 2 pillows on the bed not enough if your a reader.The bathroom had a very late seventies look, complete with the dreadful shower curtain it lacked all the beautiful tiles that Morrocco is known for. We expected to have a long lie in, that wasnt possible as for some reason the .cleaning staff were very noisy. The hotel may be high above the city but a view of a port is not so pretty. …",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2014,5,"""5 star experience""","El Minzah has the perfect combination of a somewhat aged exotic character, a wonderful view over the town, and a very high standard of service, including onsite parking. We were fussed over in a very friendly but un-intrusive manner. The breakfast and evening meals were particularly excellent, as well as the music and dance entertainment. We had easy access by foot to all of the main attractions like the Medina, the souks, the Kasbah, and other landmarks, and a long walk along the beach. We really look forward to staying again!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2015,3,Gone glory. Better options around,Despite 5 stars and a landmark reputation I will never come back. Worn out and carpetry everywhere. The worst are the beds which were very small and hard. My room was very small. Bathroom was nice though. The keycards failed evertime when I came back to the room in the afternoon. So back to the reception ....a common problem - my colleagues reported the same. Unacceptable for such a hotel. In spite of other comments wifi worked well and staff at reception was friendly.

The service was good, especially in reception & the bars. I had breakfast one day, rather late, it was pretty good.

Facilities are okay, the furniture are a bit old (rusty) but the style is nice. Rooms are large and okay. It is easy to get a cab, petit taxi or grand taxi, easy to find, and easy to leave.

 September 2014,4,Loved the old world charm,"We stayed here only one night on our way to Fes. I loved the old-world charm of the place. The pool and patio area are lovely and the bar and restaurant areas equally pleasant. The staff were helpful and polite but bar staff were a little grumpier and expected to be tipped regularly. Loved the outfits of the ""bellboys"" with their fezzes and knickerbockers. Our room had a view of the harbour but I would have been just as happy with a view of the inner courtyard or pool side. Hallways are beautifully decorated in traditional Moroccan patterns and weaves and have splendid high ceilings.

 November 2014,2,Lost its magic,"In Morocco we say ""beauty has gone but traces remain"". It applies here very well. I was disapointed by almost everything in this hotel. It lost its magic. Besides the location and the sea view (when you have a room with a sea view), and some other places such as the Terrsasse, the Wine Bar , everything is old and even poor.

I concur all that this guest reviewed on, we had a similar experience. Never again, when there is so much better in Tangiers. We stayed at La Tangerina and loved it so much we stayed another night.

It was built in 1930 and it's arabic styling makes it easy to picture oneself having a drink on the patio or dining with some of the big names from the 1940's and 50's that really did walk the hallways. Rex Harrison, Rita Hayworth, Rock Hudson to name a few. The hotel has been beautifully maintained and has a great view facing the sunrise over Tangier harbor. Our room was very comfortable and quiet.

On my most recent visit the staff were their usual helpful selves - absolutely nothing was too much trouble - we were treated regally which I have always found to be the case . Really lovely room with terrace overlooking the bay ( probably my favourite view in The world) - Some might say that it has got a bit tatty round the edges - well I LOVE IT because it is a little ""lost in time"" - it still has charm , ambience & warmth .

It is furnished in a traditional style, however it is obvious that everything, even soft furnishings are decades old and poorly maintained, bearing in mind this is a country of smokers, the smell of stale smoke lingers throughout. The standard of the hotel is poor, paint splashes on floors, broken tiles on walls and floors. Our superior room with a large balcony overlooking the bay was equally tired, although the standard of cleaning was very good. The central courtyard which could be lovely, was soulless and even the fountained didn't work of days. Dead or dying pot plants in reception are all indicative of poor standards.

 August 2014,5,A little sanctuary in Tangier,"I have to admit, my hotel was my favorite part of my little trip to Tangier. The decor was beautiful and very Moroccan. The balconies had beautiful views of the city. The pool was nice and refreshing and a lovely place to relax, surrounded by the gardens. The courtyard was such a nice place to eat. The staff accommodated us one evening and even served us the food from the Moroccan restaurant in the courtyard. Their breakfast buffet was the best buffet I've had anywhere - fresh squeezed orange juice, crepes, fresh fruit, etc. The staff was very helpful.

 September 2014,5,Of all the gin joints in all the world...,"Its all about atmosphere and ambiance at the famous El Minzah hotel in Tangiers. It is true that the hotel is in need of a little TLC but that is really not important. Once you cross the doorstep from the bustling rue de la Liberté at the entrance of Tangier's old-town center you time-travel into a bygone era where this once glorious Maghreb palace maintains heaps of style and charm. The bar is as close as you can get to Rick's cafe forgiving the fact that the hotel is located in Tangiers and not Casablanca. The room may not have the comfort of a modern business hotel but the antique Moroccan furniture, the beautiful old parquet floors and high ceilings make this a unique place to stay. There is nothing much more relaxing than sitting by the antique pool under the arcades,…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2014,5,Review for spa services - didn't stay in hotel itself,"The spa is excellent. They use top grade European products and they take their time. The price - about 60 euro - is not a bargain but not too bad given that there seem to be few other options. The foot massage was also excellent. The facilities are clean and relatively modern (it's a new annex building). The pool looked quite nice. They sell day passes to that for about 30 euro, and a weeks pass at the fairly equipped gym is about 50 euro for the week. So given the uneven reviews of the people who actually stayed at the hotel, I personally would recommend you use the services rather than stay at the hotel itself. There are some great riads to rent and I think that is the best way to go, as long as they are reviewed themselves.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2014,3,Well past due date,"My fiance and I spent two nights at El Minzah Hotel in mid-August 2014. We were told (by travel agent and others who'd been to Tangier) that El Minzah was the ""only 5 star hotel in Tangier."" While that may have been the case in the 1950s and 60s, it certainly isn't so anymore. The rooms are basic and the service is frustratingly slow. The front desk staff was not helpful at all, and at times, quite rude. We'd spent 11 days in the rest of Morocco prior to arriving in Tangier and nearly every place we stayed was 10 times better than El Minzah. There is another property called Le Mirage in Tangier that is gorgeous and truly 5 (or 6!) star. I would not recommend El Minzah.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 August 2014,1,The Decline of the El Minzah,"This wasn’t the first time my partner and I had stayed at the El Minzah, but it was most definitely the last. In the twenty years that have passed since our first stay there almost everything about the hotel has deteriorated so much that it seems quite inexplicable how the El Minzah can still retain its five-star status, when the condition of the rooms and the public areas and the quality of the service would barely be acceptable in a three-star hotel. We arrived at half past eight in the morning and were aware that in all likelihood we would not be given our room until three in the afternoon, which seems to be the standard check-in time in Morocco.

Upon check in we were met by 2 rude guys who were so unfriendly & unwelcoming. We requested quiet rooms. They gave us rooms facing a courtyard on the 2nd floor, this is extremely noisy as the breakfast ( vile by the way) is served. My room was creepy, smelly, old with no AC. It was not working at all. The room was musty, stale and red hot. Impossible to sleep when you are faced with what resembles a dog blanket on the nasty bed. This blanket. Well words cannot describe.

The hotel was a convenient 5 minute cab ride from the port (the cab ride, in a grand taxi, cost 6 euro). We were very impressed from the moment we walked into the hotel. Morocco is much different than Europe, and can be a bit of a culture shock at first; but, we felt very comfortable at this hotel. Our room had the best views of the Bay of Tangier, and we very much enjoyed sitting on our balcony. The hotel restaurant (there are a couple, but we went to the Moroccan one) offered traditional cuisine.

The hotel staff are very helpful, if you are looking for a tour guide just for yourself or if you simply need to figure out your day plan or where to eat, they help you out with all of that.

You can imagine the people who stayed there in its day and what it was like. Our room was lovely albeit a bit small but we had a balcony with a view of the sea. Breakfast was great. The town itself leaves a lot to be desired, We stayed two nights as a way station between taking the ferry from Spain and continuing on by train to Fes. When we arrived everyone was exceptionally pleasant, however, after a long frustrating day waiting for and taking the ferry, we were not prepared for three people to take us and our luggage to our room, all expecting tips.

I wondered whether it was because we had prepaid through Expedia. There is a problem with the electronic keys at this hotel. The staff knows it, but management makes them deal with it. Use of the keys varies. Sometimes you have to stab the lock multiple times quickly. Sometimes you do it three times. Sometimes you do it one time. The keys in our room did not work. We heard of others complaining about the same issue. Every time, the staff made us feel that it was our fault. The air conditioning did not cool.

There is too much deferred maintenance. the hotel needs a major overhaul.. The repairman cannot keep upt with the constant problems. . The WIFI in my room has never worked and outside my room it is at best sporadic . Recently the elevator was out of order and no effort was made to contact people with iimited mobility and to offer them acess to the service elevator There have been too many changes in direction of the hotel the the employee morale is very low And one must pay extra to have espresso at breakfast....5 etoiles, I think not.

 April 2014,5,Thoroughly Enjoyable Stay,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It has a lovely old fashioned charm. Rooms are clean and well appointed. Staff is very friendly, smiling and helpful. Restaurants are lovely. Breakfast buffet is out of this world - probably the most lavish we have ever experienced ... a recipe for over indulgence. We are looking forward to returning to this hotel in the near future.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2014,4,A fabulous throw-back. I'd like to live there.,"I stayed there for 4 nights during a business trip to Tangier. Its a tiny bit worn. But, so many good things to offset this slight negative. Superb service. Remembering My favorite Moroccan rose. The table we liked to sit at for breakfast. The Hamman. Breakfast buffet and my constant need for more coffee. Suburb tour guides and taxi drivers. A gorgeous pool and gardens. Laundry service that was inexpensive and so very quick. Several ""Bon jour""'s from all the staff. A wonderful piano bar. Comfy beds. The call for prayer that greets you in the morning and hauntingly puts you to bed. I love morocco and I love the El Minzah.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2014,3,2 day stay,"I stayed here for 2 days in May 2014. Being a 5 star I expected better. The staff were very attentive especially in the restaurant and bar. The rooms were clean. The buffet breakfast is superb. -with the exception of the second morning when the stupid Manager of the hotel lit a cigarette at his table. What a total prat! Considering children were present and there are plenty of outdoor tables available it was totally thoughtless and moronic! However this hotel needs refurbishment. The bedroom verandas needed painting desperately, the bathrooms were not 5 star albeit good. The in house evening restaurant was pricey for the standard and not memorable food. I imagine in years gone by this WAS a great hotel but no longer.This hotel needs investment to restore it to a proper 5 star…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2014,3,Nice Hotel & Staff,"Overall, the hotel staff was welcoming. The room's view was the street front so there was some noise-- cars honking horns, call to prayer from nearby mosques. The bed was firm. I became frustrated because I could not log into the wireless internet on my iphone5s when I checked into the hotel so I called down to the front desk. Within a short time, a guy showed up to my room. He looked at my cell phone and said that their computer guy was changing some things on the hotel's wireless. He would notify them of my issue and check back with me. I thought for sure that it would take a long while but it seemed like he was back knocking on my door to ask me to try the internet on my phone almost within an hour.

 June 2013,5,The place if you don't want to dig to deeply into Tangier,"This is a top-level Moroccan hotel and the place to be if travelers aren't feeling too adventurous. The unofficial street guides know better than to approach a person inside this hotel, as they will likely run into trouble with officials and official guides. The bar has a nice ambiance and the main Moroccan style restaurant will have some quality, live Moroccan music. Reservations for that is a good idea. If one is on a first trip to Tangier then he or she might be feeling a bit anxious about the street activity and high-pressure sales outside. This would be a place to get away from that.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

We had our round trip tickets but unfortunately, the ferry service shut down without notice. There was no one to help us. They closed the ticket office and that was it. We found this hotel on Tripadvisor and booked a room. Getting to the hotel was hairy with all the people coming up to us trying to get us to buy things and we were sucked in by one man which turned into two men who were ""protecting"" us. They took us to places where their friends had goods to buy and they all pressured us heavily! It was NOT a good experience.

 July 2013,4,Good hotel for a stay in Tangier.,"We stayed at the El Minzah hotel for a night as part of our Globus guided tour, which spent a night in Tangier. Overall we found the hotel to be of a good standard and met our requirements. The hotel is located in a fairly nice, rather old section of Tangier. Just up the street from the hotel is the French consulate. The hotel itself is one of the oldest, grandest and best known hotels in Morocco. A number of celebrities have stayed there over the decades, and they have pictures with their famous guests around the lobby to prove it! We had two rooms for the four of us and they were located next to one another. The hotel is quite large with lots of different corridors and wings but it's quite easy to understand after you've done it once, and the staff are happy to help. We had…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2014,3,Hard to Evaluate,"Because of the vibes in this city, and because we were only here for a day, it's hard to evaluate. We did feel safe within the hotel, which we didn't outside.

Frankly, I don't know where else you would stay.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2014,5,lovely,"I loved the ambience of this older Moroccan hotel. I can just picture it before the commercialization of the area.

A plus was the gallery of famous celebrity photos.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2014,5,It Doesn't Get Much Better!,"For my 5th stay in Tangiers in the last ten years and my girlfriend's 1st I thought we'd try something a little special. NOT disappointed at all! I booked a sea view with balcony and it was perfect with couple of chairs and a table to enjoy a fabulous panorama of Tangier bay with an aperitif and beautiful at night, twinkling stars and lights. Located on the edge of the Medina and near the French Embassy you are centrally placed for everything. The 2 restaurants are good, the Moroccan one has a great feel and we enjoyed tagine and sweets all served by friendly and attentive staff. The hotel is beautifully decorated and there are some discreet pictures of well known guests around the central courtyard. There was nothing we did not like.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2014,4,This looks a great hotel,"We stayed only one night on our train journey to Marrakech. It is a very authentic and atmospheric hotel and I can see that a lot of people really like it. For me, and maybe it was because I was not feeling too well, I was not comfortable here. It is really dark and old fashioned and all the staff are men wearing Moroccan dress.In the dining room, also really dark, musicians are playing Moroccan music all the time. I'm sure it was all really good but sorry, I just didn't like the place at all. Too oppressive and the staff overly fawning.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 March 2014,5,The El Minzah - just as good as ever.,"I have been visiting Tanger for some thirty years having lived there for some time in the early 80s . I found the dear old Minzah to be just as good as ever . ALL THE STAFF were just 100% , the room was lovely and the breakfasts were superb. Nothing was too much trouble . We ate in the restaurant a couple of times and that was also good. I read some previous reviews about some staff only speaking Mahgrebi , French or Spanish - well I say what on earth do you expect - do you expect all American hotels to speak Arabic? On the subject of tipping - please remember that tipping is the custom here - so don't expect miracles if you are not prepared to unload the odd 20 dirhams here and there - if you are staying at the Minzah you can afford it!

 January 2014,5,"Fun, Relaxing Bar","The bar at the El Minzah is elegantly appointed, with a great staff and excellent service. We did not stay here, but it's well located between the medina and the new city. Built in the 1930s, it's hosted many famous guests. Great live music most nights. We really enjoyed our time here, most specifically due to the professionalism and hospitality of Mohammed, the manager in the lounge. He was one of the most friendly and welcoming people we met during our stay in Tangier. We came back to the hotel for drinks and food twice during our stay because of Mohammed's wonderful service and great personality. He even provided us with his personal mobile # in case we needed any help while in Tangier. Top notch experience that we won't soon forget!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 January 2014,2,Bad experience,"We stayed at El Minzah for only one night. Hotel was highly recommended and the initial impression was very good - very nice looking property, helpful staff at the reception, free wifi, etc. Room also looked great with a spectacular view. The beginning of our stay was excellent. However... I do not want to write a ""bash"" review for this hotel, just list a few facts so that you could make your own conclusions: 1. Other than at reception, nobody spoke English, only French and Spanish 2.. We could not make a room service order because of the above and someone had to come up so that we could show what we wanted. Funny enough we still did not get what we ordered 3. We traveled with our son, the room had two bath towels and one a face one(!) for the three of us. 4.

 January 2014,2,IT COULD BE GOOD BUT IT WAS AWFUL,"Before I retired, I was able to stay in some of the best hotels around the globe for my work. El Minzah should have been one of them. Not only was I disappointed after having looked at the photos on Internet (they show rooms that look three times the size of what I had) and praise given to food, etc. As we had not had lunch when we arrived, the first stop was the restaurant. Brunch was being served (around 11-30pm) but it was that and nothing else. I have never eaten such an expensive small salad in my life. The rooms were definitely not sound proof. I don't mind the laughter but sometimes it is not that at all. I was looking forward to a hot bath or shower. The water tank had been out of order in Assilah so here at least it would be hot. Well it was, but the bath plug was…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2013,5,New Year in El Minzah,"This is possibly the fifth time I have stayed for a few days in this hotel and each time they have recognised me and even offered me the same room as I had last year. This is the old-fashioned sort of service you do not get now. In the cello bar of the quad, I even had a table reserved that I liked on a previous occasion! I was also approached by the trio on the next table and got into conversation. I found I was actually talking to members of the Moroccan Royal Family. This is a place you will see familiar faces but you are not to recognise them! My room was fine, everything worked (including the satellite YV and wifi) and I had a large and very comfortable double bed to myself.

Was not informed prior to the evening. Main meal was inedible as cold and meat was tough Entertainment scaled down too. Evening was finished by 1.00 a.m. So disgusted checked out following morning.

(literally) * the room we booked (luxury double with terrace) was small, by European standards (very very small I suppose by US standards) * some work was botched in the bathroom ceiling, which presented a big gap ! * the soundproofing from outside (simple glazing) was poor * the room and some common parts were really old-fashioned, with faded decoration * the service from some waiters at…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The decor is moorish and Moroccan in style, albeit a little dated. However the food was pretty amazing, this being a gastronomic delight with various restaurants on site.

The staff are extremely courteous and helpful, everyone from management to the junior bar staff. Whereas the property itself might appear somewhat tired in comparison to European standards the staff really make up for it. We normally book online to get the best deals. We only went for 4 days this time round but decided to stay an extra 3 nights and we were offered the same room at the same online rates. CUSTOMS: This is Morocco and people should bear it in mind.

The only downside was our bar bill as we left! There is an on-site spa which is apparently excellent (I didn't try it, but we spoke to couples who had).

I would agree with the other comments that I don't think this is a 5-star hotel but we found it to be a very nice place to stay.

When he complained he was met with a simple 'oh dear!' Nothing was done to rectify the situation no further food offered or money off the bill.

Our hotel was comfortable with a small balcony overlooking the Medina. The few staff members we encountered were helpful. We did not spend much time at the hotel as the nearby Medina was our focus. We needed bottled water and the wine bar could provide that for a modest fee.

 September 2012,5,A MUST For Tangier!,"I adore this hotel, having now stayed several times. It's wonderfully decorated, and up-to-date whilst still retaining a very Arab feel.

These 5* hotels are 5* only with prices , service is less than 3* hotels . After staying in Movenpick and andalucia for the last 8 years and I was horrified by the quality and value for money I decided this year to stay in alminzah ( by the way I stayed in these hotels because I have to come to tangier for personal reasons). Al minzah is an expensive hotel with a very bad service and very dirty the food is average . There is no hangers in the bathroom and our room smells of grind fish every evening the windows don't close so the aircon is not efficient - I can write a book about the cons of this hotel , breakfast is serve in a beautiful courtyard but with dirty floors…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 June 2013,3,Disappointing,"After reading many of the reviews here, I expected service to be really good. It didn't happen. Most of the people we came into contact with were stone-faced and rude. A real disappointment. The hotel itself is ok, and some of it looks very nice. The hallways are dark and need more lighting. The room where we had breakfast was very decorative, and the breakfast was good. The view from the dining room over the Strait is beautiful. But our dinner there was not so good and the waiter was very rude. Unfortunately, our room looked down onto the street and was noisy. The room itself was small and had the hardest beds on our entire trip. TV worked fine with some English channels. AC didn't work.

It's not as glamorous as you'd find it on the website. But you might find it to be the best hotel in the Tangier area. Although I'd have to find out myself. It's got great views of the city and the strait. You can always inquire to go to the rooftop for better views/pictures. They have people available for ""tour"" guides. But if you're ok without them, it's fine. They work off tips, so be careful with that one. It's still fine if you just want to get out and see a bit of the area, just be prepared to pay more than what was agreed upon. The hotel has all Moroccan rugs.

 May 2013,5,A Very Pleasant Stay,"We read the mixed reviews on the El Minzah Hotel and decided to take a chance and stay there our one night in Tangier. The architecture was lovely and the location could not have been better as it was close to the medina, etc. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room while on the small side was nice. Our breakfast was good and our waiter efficient with a very good sense of humor. In fact, he went to the extreme to insure we had everything we wanted and that the food was to our liking.

As I did not know what Hotel had been booked for me, I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel was a colonial style Hotel with a certain charm in the middle of Tangier. I got checked in very fast, but some of my colleagues needed to wait for their room to be ready, as we came in a bit early. The room was ok, nothing special but with a nice view on the courtyard. The pool was small, but the garden surrounding it was nice. The service at the pool was Ok, but a bit strange. The waiters first insisted that they could not bring food to the pool area, but then it was Ok to get a Club sandwich. In the evening we ate at the restaurant in the hotel.

 April 2013,5,A hotel to conjour-up the mystique of Tangiers,"By modern standards, El Minzah is not, perhaps, the best hotel to stay at in Tangiers. If you wish to relive the atmosphere of Tangiers at the time it was an international enclave of mystique, decadence and intrigue - then El Minzah is for you! I first stayed there in the late 70's, and again in the 80's, 90's and now again. The decor hasn't changed much, and the staff are perhaps more weary of the modern day tourist, but they immediately 'perk-up' when they realise you appreciate the Minzah and them for the experience, the quality and the professionalism. There are only a few hotels remaining in the World that still offer a glimpse of a life that used to be, and El Minzah tops my list.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 April 2013,5,Excellent customer service,I wrote an earlier review noting that the hotel lacked free wi-fi. A representative from the hotel wrote to apologize and promised that the hotel intended to offer complimentary wi-fi in the future.

 March 2013,5,5 stars and 2 thumbs up,"Once you arrive in Morocco (anywhere that's relatively within driving distance via a Grand Taxi), just tell your driver ""Minzah"" -- it's by far the most well-known hotel in the entire country.

Honestly, I didn't know what to think before I booked this trip ... but I knew I didn't have too much time off from work, and I wanted to say I'd seen Africa! So, a taxi to JFK and 12 hours later, we arrived ... and it was wonderful. Yes, be wary of hacklers ... and no, not everyone loves Americans. BUT -- get to Minzah, and they will take care of you.

Although I did not get to eat at their ""gourmet"" restaurant, the traditional meal was good and the cous cous was the best I ever had. I hired a driver to take me to the Bizarre and tour the local area. I guess I had to ask myself why I went to Tangier. But the hotel was very nice, charming, a ""classic"". The outside pool was out of service while I was there - but the indoor pool and gym were excellent. The staff were both helpful and indifferent depending who I dealt with. For example- started out so helpful, but then when I asked to have the room that I paid for (I paid for a balcony and was put in a small, stuffy…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Although one might question the price premium the Minza asks in comparison with other hotels which haven't been brushed up as of late, but still offer good and clean quality, but for a third of the price We travelled in a big group of friends and two incidents spoiled the trip. First there were some problems paying the dinner bill as all of a sudden exactly 1000 dirham went missing (100 euros) and nobody was responsible (we had counted more than once...) after some discussion we went the hotel manager who then dropped the topic rather quickly as we mentioned that we already had a bad impression as poeple were 'upgraded'…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

We felt their service, particularly at reception doesn't do justice to the lovely surroundings and ambiance. Would still stay there again and some of the staff were lovely and helpful, but delays at reception a nuisance and not acknowledged or apologised for. Breakfast in a lovely room, with plenty of choice but lapses with orders and a bit slow to fill up where things ran out.

The room was a decent size, seemed clean, and had a very large terrace overlooking the pool and coast. Unfortunately we had a mouse-sized cockroach visitor in our room. He was hanging on our cornice in a lighted room for quite some time until my husband scared him out onto the terrace, so I assume he was poisoned and did not have long for this earth.

My girlfriend and I then went up to our room, which was beautiful with a terrace view of the pool and beyond it the ocean. The guy from reception then called to say they had upgraded our room for free, but that I would have to pay 80 dirham more per night because I ""brought my wife"" -- though I had booked the room originally for two people.

 March 2013,4,Comfort of home within a very foreign city,"My husband and I traveled from NYC to Tangier last week for 4 nights. We were very happy with our stay at El Minzah; stepping through the doors put us at ease in a city where we kept our guard up outside the confines of the hotel. The breakfast gratis was very enjoyable, and we spent a portion of all evenings having wine and listening to the Egyptian singer at the bar. We dined once at the Moroccan restaurant, which was good but not outstanding, as well as one of our pricier meals in Morocco. Both recommendations we inquired about----a guide for the medina and a local restaurant---exceeded our expectations.

Don’t expect a slick modern hotel. If you long to truly experience historic Tangier with some modern amenities and quality service this is the place. Have an excellent breakfast served on your private balcony overlooking the Mediterranean with a view of Gibraltar. Spend a day at the pool and have an exceptional lunch surrounded by flowers and song birds. It’s a short walk to the Socco Grande if you want to explore the Medina.

Evocative of a grand and deliciously decadent age in Tangier. Okay, that's maybe a bit over the top but I had a good time exploring the hotel, imagining its past and enjoying its present. Service was excellent and the room was absolutely fine with a nice view. Yes, it's not a new glitzy 5 star - it's more interesting than that.

However there are photos of some if its more famous guests - Churchill, Rita Hayworth, Ryan O'Neal & Farrah Fawcett etc. and you can imagine they would still recognise the place. There's a nice bar with sensible prices. We ate in the restaurant one night and had a typical Moroccan meal complete with band and belly dancer, the latter was a surprise but the meal was average and relatively expensive.

The omens were not good as the November weather was awful to the point that the Tarifa - Tangier ferry was cancelled for 2 days during our stay. This meant that we were confined to the El Minzah which turned out to be a real bonus.

The hotel is off the main boulevard and at the entrance of the Medina. It has an old world charm that definitely still works. From the moment you walk in you feel you are elevated to a time in the past with a rich Moroccan hospitality. And why not, for the El Minza has a long tradition of celebrities who have paused under their roof through history. You can buy a book about the history of the hotel; available at the reception.

Moreover prices were very high for Morroco (170 and 120 dirhams). We never returned to any restaurant inside the hotel !

 September 2012,3,Once a nice Hotel,"This hotel was built in the 1920's and has been frequented by movie stars (all dead now). The experience today is like a taste of old Morocco. The room was clean and quiet, but dark. The bath was updated sometime past, so was ok. The room could use some updating and nicer touches kile better lighting. The food was average at best as was the service. We went out for a walk after dinner and the streets were wall to wall with people.

 August 2012,3,Rooms are small,We stayed for a night at El Minzah while visiting Tanger. Our room was really small but had a great view of the gorgeous pool. The hotel spa is located in another building which is a little inconvenient but service at the spa was great. Decor of the hotel is exceptional. Breakfast was amazing with variety of foods both hot and cold. Hotel cost for wifi is slightly high.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2012,2,"Nice hotel, unprofessional high-pressure sales tactics","When we arrived at El Minzah, our room was not yet clean. So, the staff recommended we take a walking tour with a tour guide. At first, the tour was nice: he took us around the Medina and we went to lunch at a very nice, although expensive, restaurant. After walking around a bit, we were taken into a carpet shop. The owner took us up the roof to show us his view, gave us mint tea, took pictures of us--then started pushing his carpets on us. The rest of our ""tour"" consisted of going around to various other shops where we were pressured into buying things we did not want and had never asked to see. It ended soon after it became apparent we wouldn't be shelling out any more money, but the guide then tried to pressure us into taking another tour the next day.

 July 2012,4,Closest perhaps to Morocco in the 1930s,"This hotel is an experience that should appeal to people with an appreciation for the early-to-mid-20th century. It dates from the early 30s, and still retains much of the charm of that period. For fans of this period, it proves very rewarding. For those expecting a hotel judged in contemporary terms, it is likely to be a little bit of a disappointment. If you want that you should perhaps go to a sleek modern one. The charms of this hotel are the view across the pool to the early 20th century buildings of the city, the nooks and crannies with little vintage sitting areas, the fact that there is a rather underwhelming fountain on the third floor, the after breakfast stroll through the remnants of a once obviously much-loved garden (down the stairs by the pool or across the…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2012,4,5 Star in 50' and 60's,"I think the Hotel has definitely the potential to be a real 5 star, but for that they need to do major upgrade and re-train their staff. At the moment it is trying to live of its legacy periods of 50's and 60s glamour times which does work for us. I don't care how many important people staid there in the past. Important is to maintain the 5 Star status and not live of its past. But of course the price would be much higher. The Hotel is located in a very good location. The rooms are specious and quite.

 May 2012,1,Check your bank account!!,"Initially this was a clean, charming if ever so slightly tacky hotel experience. But a few issues have left me extremely displeased with the hotel's conduct. A five star is not only pushing it but an outright misrepresentation. Staying at a five star hotel was meant to be a treat but we were looked upon as an anomaly to usual customer expectations and indeed made to feel slightly unwelcome being young and English no matter how polite and civil we tried to be. In one of many examples we took a taxi to the airport provided by the hotel having been told two different fares, and could sense the guilt being laid upon us having not paid over the agreed amount as a tip. This was after checking out with uncooperative staff who were not willing to even check with management whether we…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2012,1,Extremely disappointing for 5 star.,"Initially upon arrival this seemed like a comfortable hotel. The location was good, close to the medina which is full of Moroccan charm and close to the beach. Staff were friendly but spoke very poor English, which caused numerous problems when ordering food at the restaurants; we weren't served the meals we ordered due to our order being lost in translation. The room and our overall stay at the hotel was mediocre, but the main problem arose after we had left the hotel and CHECKED OUR BANK ACCOUNT AT HOME IN ENGLAND. I found that I had been charged for three nights instead of two. I emailed the hotel straight away expecting a reply within a day or two; I received no reply.

Our room had a balcony that had stunning views of the Mediterranean. It is centrally located and whilst it has security staff at the front entrance and the car park, it s a very safe area as long as you turn left out of the front door of the hotel. Turning right leads you down to an area where many younger people are high on glue and once they see you are a tourist they follow you until you give them money for glue. Very sad indeed.

Secondly ,the builing is full of traditional, local flavor.You are definately in Morocco. Thirdly, my room was spacious and had a nice sea view. Fourthly, the garden is full of colorful flowers and interesting trees, visited by wild birds.The swimming pool is well maintained and gave me a nice break, after walking in dusty parts of the town.

Good location and even though it is older, it has been pretty well maintained, grounds are lovely. The main problem we had was with the very slow service from waiters in the terrace and pool bar and the breakfast restaurant. Slow to the point of being ignored and having to go to the bartender or waiter and ask for service after waiting over ten minutes at the table, almost 30 minutes near the pool. Once we got their attention, service was fine but the waits were unacceptable since it was not terribly busy.

Opposite other hotels build around hundred years ago this one has remained its charm and has not done an untasteful redecoration of the rooms. I hope it remains this way as the hotel has a unique atmorsphere and a great view. I stayed during ramadan and tried out the typical ramadan breakfast served after sunset.

 January 2012,2,"70's style charm - overpriced, poor service and not 5*",The hotel retains a real 70's feel with outdated pics of celebraties long since gone and Caid's bar which feels like a cross between any hotel bar and Sams from Casablanca playing 70's classics from Boney M! Rooms are clean and tidy - indeed have a good view of the new marina in early development and there is a very large courtyard which is very impressive if you have been staying in smaller Riads in other cities. However it also feels slightly unfriendly and a magnet for tourist fodder esp with the reception and conciege staff. Examples of assistanceare taxis to aiport of 200dh when rate is 100dh; a guide around the Medina for 150dh which turns out to be a mate of the Porter who hangs outside the hotel all day waiting for his buddy to throw him a tourist.

On our arrival into our room, we were sadly disappointed. We had booked a room with a balcony with city view and received neither of these. Our safe would not work and after requesting help from the staff several times, they eventually came to help. The instructions are not clear on the safe on how to lock or open it.

The standard rooms are a bit on the small side for twin sharing and there are no facecloths..it is not a cultural thing because all the other hotels had facecloths. The one big issue was no comp. water in the rooms. This should be a given in any hotel now. Having a balcony is nice where you can sit and listen to the birds.

Beautiful restaurants but the food tastes bland for such a pricey place. A friendly concierge but not helpful.

One exception but I'm very cautious (as I'm not so sure): I had the feeling the orange juice was industrial and not pressed from fresh oranges.

Staff numbers have been cut so drastically that breakfast is a joke. Every day I ended up setting my own table with napkins and cutlery and pouring my own coffee, bringing my own food from the apalling buffet of tinned fruit, scrambled egg like yellow cement, dried out croissants and canned orange juice.

 May 2009,2,Once was but no longer is!,"We arrived in Tangier for a two day city break. We booked El Minzah for the nights of 26/27 May. I have to agree with Pyrotech England's review that this hotel is a 3 star with 5 star prices. The room was small. Though we had requested a double bed we got a twin room. Even though it was obvious that 2 stayed in the room only 1 bed was turned down every night. 5 star..... no tea or coffee on arrival, no cold towels, no dressing gowns in the room, toileteries were on par with any basic budget hotel. The air conditioning was noisy and could not be controlled from the bedside and remained noisy for some time after turning it off( get out of bed as you are about to go to sleep to do this). Breakfast was somewhere between poor and slightly ok. Choices were limited. The scrambled egg…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2008,5,Another tick in the box!,"We travelled to Tangier on the ferry from Algeciras on our motorbike (seemed to interest the locals at least!) My husband had booked the El Minzah as a surprise stopover before we continued our journey into the Rif. He didn't realise it was somewhere I'd always wanted to go! The hotel's common areas are nothing short of magnificent in 1930s splendour...Caid's Bar is a delight, The Moroccan restaurant food was AMAZING (do not snack beforehand!!) and the wine was surprisingly palatable for a Muslim country! The belly dancer and her accompanying musicians were superb. Breakfast was an absolute feast and we were waited on hand & foot. The staff are amazing. The only let down was the room...it was a tad jaded and could do with a spruce up. That said it was clean as a whistle…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2008,3,"5 star prices, 3 star service","The El Minzah is resting heavily on it's 'heritage laurels' and is definitely not delivering the 5 star treatment any more. Great location, good range of facilities if you want them and all of that old world charm. Service however is chaotic and random with some disappointing moments acted out by various staff across the board. If I can walk to the great fish restaurant 'four steps down', a minutes walk away, then the younger on the front door should not suggest I need a 20 Euro cab ride with his unlicensed 'taxi-mate' in preference. Nor do I need his expensive 'guide-mate' either. The seniors on the front desk need to be a bit more gracious and humble, in particular when giving out plenty of dud tourist information all round. Plus I don't expect to receive the same…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2008,5,You must try this hotel,"We decided to visit the El Minzah, when actually at Tangiers. We avoided booking the hotel after reviewing trip advisors comments, but we found the hotel very well situated and offered excellent accommodation, in every aspect. The staff were very attentive, it had great bars, restaurants, swimming pool and fitness centre. There was nothing we would change, it had great charm and in no way wa sit either tired or dissappointing. Finally the hotel offered great value and was cheaper than the riad we first stayed in, which was actually more expensive than this five star hotel. This place is a firm favourite for us and we suggest you always stay here when visiting Tangiers.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2008,5,Thank heavens for El Minzah!,"Travelling with friends and having been put out of our riad a day early - probably due to inefficiency rather than bad faith, but who knows - we were very thankful El Minzah could offer us two fine rooms for our last night in Morocco. We could not have had a warmer welcome and were shown to two good sized rooms with lovely views - one harbour, one pool view. After two weeks in riads I am not ashamed to say it was a thrill to have plenty of hangers, a mini bar and the other usual hotel comforts. I went straight to the hotel spa for a last wonderful hammam experience, very keenly priced, and could have stayed a week. The bar prices were on the expensive side, though they are probably charging for the experience as much as anything - Caid's Bar is famous as a hangout for spies…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2008,2,An oasis maybe?,"This is a very impressive looking grand old hotel in the heart of the city of Tangiers. It is spotlessly clean in all of the public areas and does indeed have an element of old time charm. Most of the male staff wear 'traditional turn of the century' dress. The city is very noisy and busy, however, once you are in the door the place is very tranquil and quiet with little or no road noise, it really is a peaceful oasis in a very dirty, noisy city. The pool is lovely and the gardens are pretty. General service is efficient and pleasant, especially the wating staff in the courtyard. However that is where the praise ends.... The rooms are very old and tired. They are also small. The Air Conditioning is very poor, which is not a great thing given it is a very hot city! …",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2008,4,More style than substance,"This was my third stay at the Minzah, but next time I will try somewhere else. This expensive hotel is more style than substance and the value is just not there, especially in comparison with other 5-star hotels in Morocco. The Minzah does have some advantages. It is the Grand Old Dame of Tangier hotels, and is impeccably maintained. It is well located next to the ancient medina, with easy access to the modern city and with some views over the port (which is scheduled to become a yacht marina). There is a pleasant pool with a small garden. The male staff members are decked out in 19th century tradtional garb, with tasselled fezzes, fancy jackets, long stockings, and traditional slippers, all of which imparts a quaint (if rather fake) initial atmosphere. But once …",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2008,5,Delightful,"Having arrived in Tangier last at night to the very unwelcome news that our reservation (which we had paid for in full) at the Hotel Rif & Spa, would not be honoured as they had given our room away, we panicked and began ringing round the other hotels in our guide book trying to find a room for the night. Upon hearing of our situation, the El Minzah Hotel chuckled and told us to make our way there and they would look after us. Not the first time they have seen this situation. With a great deal of relief we set off and were welcomed with warm smiles and open arms. It couldn't have been a more stark contrast to the reception we received at Hotel Rif. The hotel was pretty much full also, but they managed to find a senior suite for the night, which they heavily discounted for us…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2008,2,much ado about nothing,"This is not a 5 star hotel by any means. Few of the staff speak english or irish for that matter ,there is no internet in the rooms,the breakfast is plain [they forgot to scramble the eggs at all],if you do not know your number you will feel very uncomfortable @ breakfast with cold looks and indifference to you r requests.everybody seems to want a tip for doing nothing at all..it also sells the most expensiver alcohil on the planet earth £6.50 for a Vodka and Coke.On a positive note it appears better than others in this dirty little city...much ado about nothing sorry",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2008,2,Underutilized and sleeping beauty,"The Minzah hotel is meant to be one of two 5 star hotels in Tangier, I well could be one but seems to left alone with itself by who ever owns it. The location is great right in the heart of town with some stunning views that one could have if there would be some bits of investment and care - unfortunately it seems there isn't. Value for money again far from 'good'. It is more reasonable in pricing then the other 5* in town but old and worn out. The place has so much to offer but no one seems to utilize it. Breakfast is poor for a 5* hotel and while some of the staff are very attentive and nice, others are more busy with themselves. Internet is chargeable and then it disconnects every other minute and when you mention it at check out you're still charged if you don't insist…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2008,5,A Haven,"We originally booked at the Tanggerina but as we were very disappointed on arrival (tatty and uninspiring) we came to the Minzah which had been recommended by a friend who had lived in Morocco. The rooms are very comfertable, we were upgraded to a 'room with a view' at no extra cost, and the hotel in general had that old worldy charm, except that the bathrooms were new and beautiful. All the wood work and brass was wonderfully conserved and polished. If you want to spoil yourself come here. One word of warning, watch the young doorman, he recommends restaurants and drivers that are 50% more expensive than general and do go to Hamadi's even if he tells you it is too touristy!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2007,4,Reliable Minzah,"I've stayed here a few times but haven't posted a review before. The location is good, and it can best be described as a faded grand hotel. The staff are courteous and nicely turned out in Moroccan costume. The rooms are OK, clean, but in need of updating. Everyone speaks good English. The breakfast is served in a lovely courtyard, and is very good. There is a large pool and a huge spa/fitness centre. I haven't tried the restaurant, but hear good reports. The bar is a popular place and apparently stays open as long as there are customers. It's expensive by local standards, but worth a visit, Some very quaint ornaments and pictures on display, and the whole place has an atmosphere all of its own.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2007,3,Tired old hotel needs revamp,"Was in Tangiers for business so booked into this hotel in the centre of town. Sadly, the first room was so small and smokey ( the previous occupant must have chain smoked 2 packs the previous night!) that I requested a change. The staff were happy to oblige and moved me to a much nicer room overlooking the bay. The view of the port and of Spain in the distance was fantastic. Now for the bad news..There was no internet in the room. No longer an option for a hotel that is hoping to attract serious business travellers and even techno literate tourists. The only way to go online was to use the free wifi from the lobby, not an ideal option at all. Also there was no workspace in the room, the dressing table provided was barely wider than my laptop and no spare plugs to charge…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2007,3,"Interesting place to stay - El Minzah, Morocco","We stayed at El Minzah only one night as part of a Moroccan Tour with In-Sight tours. Yes - tour buses do stop at this hotel. We have no real complaints about the place - taking it for what is was. Our gateway into Morocco. Place was very clean with nice garden surrounds and a good swimming pool. (We did not swin in it - just drank Casablanca Beer sitting beside it) Our room on the first floor, looked over the front street. Noise level was low (until a wedding party arrived around 2am waking half the hotel) That was interesting though. We had the evening meal and breakfast at the hotel and although part of the tour package, we found the food good and above average. We would have liked to stay another day or two if it were possible. Unlike others who had bad…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2007,4,1st class service,"I only stayed at this beautiful hotel for one night, but it was quite the experience. First and foremost, the service is outstanding! We has dinner in the Moroccan restaurant, which has a belly dancing show, and the service was amazing. The food was also out of this world. If you have a chance to have breakfast, I highly recommend you get the ""Moroccan Crep"" It was delicious. The spa is beautiful, and the prices are very reasonable. There is not hat much to do around the hotel in terms of night life, but there is three restaurants and the piano bar inside the hotel. Word to the wise, Morocco is 2 hours behind Spain, so if you are coming from there, please note that the hotel restaurants only open at 8pm.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2007,5,Great hotel in a wonderful city!,"We have just returned from a 2 week trip to Spain, Portugal & Morocco. Our stay in Tangier at El Minzah was a 1 night stay which we thoroughly enjoyed. The hotel is in keeping with the atmosphere & feeling of Morocco! We took the morning ferry from Tarifa & were met by our guide that took us around for the day on a wonderful tour of Tangier. We had dinner in the hotel in the Arabic restaurant where bellydancers perform while we ate dinner!! Our rooms were very clean & we had asked for a sea view & I must admit that the view at night is especially enchanting. Tangier is an education and is fascinating to visit. Highly recommend the El Minzah for a visit to Tangier!!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2006,5,Wonderful Stay at El Minzah,My friend and I had a fabulous stay at El Minzah. Everyone that worked there was warm and very welcoming. The property and and view from our room were both beautiful. Great location too. Would definitely reccomend staying here. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the massage I got at the hotel. Besides that absolutely everything was perfect.,El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2006,4,Old World Charm,"The El Minzah is the place to stay in Tangier in my opinion. The location is great, right above the Grand Socco and the entrance to the medina. It is also part of Tangier's history as it has been around for about 100 years. Though it does 'miss the mark' every now and then, it does try. (A light bulb blew in my room, took 2 days to get it replaced as one example). The restaurants are good and the staff was very friendly. My room overlooked the pool, which overlooked the Straits of Gibraltar, which overlooked Spain. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good well-known hotel with a fantastic location.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2006,4,"Loved the El Minzah, peace and comfort in the chaos of Tangier","My husband and I stayed at the El Minzah during a short trip to Tangier. It was a last minute change to our travel schedule, but one of the most memorable hotels we stayed at during our 5 week trip throughout Europe. The staff were very friendly, and eager to help. We also enjoyed their restaurants and piano bar in the evenings. The El Minzah was our safe haven admist the chaotic streets of Tangier. We would definitely return to the El Minzah if we went back to Morocco. Also, we would highly recommend hiring a tour guide to navigate any parts of the city.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2006,2,Faded glory,"Gee, it must have been a great hotel in the '30s! It still has masses of character and a good town-centre location. However, the air conditioning was dodgy, the lift hardly worked, there was inadequate lighting in the dining room and the wall decorations were faded and musty. Invest a couple of million and you'd have a gem.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2006,5,Great,"I went to Tangier with my husband and three children(14, 13, 9) the first weekend in June and had a great time at El Minzah. After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor about Tangier and El Minzah I regretted booking a room and was anxious about our stay there. The El Minzah was wonder, the staff more than helpful and courteous. Upon arrival we were greeted and shown to our rooms. The staff called our room within 15 min to ask if everything was to our liking and offered additional services as needed. A tour guide was arraged to walk us through the Medina---12 euro for three hours with Joseph. The following day Abraham drove us around for 4 hours at 40 euro. No scam there. The resturants in the hotel are fine.The wait staff is very polite , no touching or rude faces/comments.. …",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2006,1,"Oh, How Sad!","I have been to tangier many times, and have even stayed at the Minzah before. Before making this booking I took a deep breath and prayed that the less that polite service had improved. I stayed for two nights, and found myself in the grips of the tyranical staff who run the reception, treating clients like newcomers at boot-camp. I just don't understand it! The place is nice enough, although shoddy. It's essentially a 4-star hotel pretending to be a 5-star. I'd recommend the much more charasmatic and authentic Hotel Continental, on the seafront. My friends were staying there at the same time I was at El Minzah and I was green with jealousy!",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2006,1,Just plain awful behaviour.,"This hotel used to be on my top 10 of hotels ever visited. Full of character and a bit of luxury with it. I have visited this hotel at least 20 times since 1997, both on business and family breaks. It is above average in all it offers, but not 5 star, and I have always opted for this hotel as opposed to the Movenpick across the bay, however, my last visit will remain just that, my last visit, which is very sad for me as it was like home from home when stopping off from travels back from Marrakech and Casablanca. My last visit was arranged in a hurry through a large international corporation based in Casablanca, faxes were lost and though they expected us they had no fax confirmation to confirm corporate rates, which they no claim do not exist. I have to say that 60% of my stays…",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2006,1,not recommended for women travellers,"Waiting staff in the breakfast room were very 'hands on' taking any opportunity to touch you (when directing you to the table etc). We booked a hotel taxi for collection from the airport, and reception staff refused to add the cost of the taxi to our bill. Check out took fifteen minutes, and I was expected to submit my pin details in a crowded area with people looking over my shoulder. We were not advised that the pool and sauna would be unavailable during our visit. However, we did enjoy the excellent service and food in the wine bar - shame the rest of the hotel and staff were such a disappointment.",El_Minzah_Hotel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Exercise facilities housed in separate building across from dining areas. Outstanding tomato-based soup, their specialty. Small, comfortable bar with free munchies. Room, bed and bathroom facilities, comfortable. Breakfast fare included fruit, breads, rolls, eggs, etc. The French Embassy is located up the street and, further on, stores for shopping. Doorman would not allow us day nor night, men nor women, to go in opposite direction toward downward leading steps which citizenry used when called to pray at the mosque. When we inquired, no one would tell us anything more than that it was not safe.
