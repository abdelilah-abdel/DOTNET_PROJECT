 November 2022,5,Very nice place,"Very nice place. Friendly staff. Great views from terrace on the roof. Nice breakfast. Bed was very comfortable. I stayed in both most popular hostels in Tangier, and to be honest I liked this one better.",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2022,5,The Best Budget place,"The Best Budget place to stay in Tangier, staff is so so polite and sweet, reached there at 7am well before checkin time and they still offered me a bed and a place to unwind and relax from a long journey also offered me free breakfast which I wasn’t eligible for on the day, Breakfast was absolutely delicious trendy and limited but enough for 1 person to start the day. Highly Recommended.",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2018,5,The only place to stay in Tangiers,"After a disappointing reservation at another tangier hostel I came across this gem. As son as I walked inside there was an overwhelming sense of support by the guy on reception. The dorn was queit and clean with an ensuite, the sleep wasrestful and breakfast was filling.",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2017,4,Friendly hostel with an amazing rooftop view,"Tangier was our first destination in Morocco. We were pretty overwhelmed and had a lot of hassle, even right outside the hostel, as the medina area turned out to be pretty dodgy. However, the hostel felt like a safe nest in the middle of the chaos. The staff were very friendly and we could always depend on them to help us with any issues we had. We stayed for two nights in a four person dorm. Indeed, the humidity in Tangier was crazy and the dorm wasn't any better; you couldn't escape the damp cold feeling especially at night. There is a bathroom attached to the dorm, and the sewers were kinda smelly. However, the place has two lovely terraces with absolutely amazing views of the town and sea. A tasty, traditional breakfast is served there, and I thoroughly enjoyed having my…",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2017,4,worth staying,"I stayed at the Medina hostel for two nights with friends, I quite liked the place. It has a great view from rooftop. The breakfast is petty standard type, and the staff members are very friendly and helpful. It's a bit tricky to find the place as it's located at the edge of the medina, just follow the sign on the wall you will get there easily. Remember if you ask a local to show you the place, he will surely ask you some money.",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2017,4,A little Oasis,"This hostel almost feels like it is not a part of Tanger. Located close to the edge of the Medina and the Grand Mosque it is within walking distance of the Ferry port. Medina hostel provides a quiet relief from the in your face chaos of the city which surrounds it. Unfortunately this is where the separation ends, prone to the constant humidity and poor drainage of Tanger, things tend to feel a bit damp and there can be a sewage smell. However this being a small backpacker hostel I would consider these uncontrollable environmental issues. Staff were very pleasant, calm and helpful. Provided us with useful advice and were honest (a refreshing change from much of the rest of the city). Breakfast was the standard basic Moroccan bread/cheese and Coffee. The view from the roof…",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2017,1,Smelly Hell - AVOID,"NEVER AGAIN! This was the worst night in my life. My bed in the dorm was the one just right next to the bath room door. The smell coming out of the sink/shower through the CLOSED bath room door was so horrible that I did not manage to all asleep. I fled to the roof top terrace/kitchen where I slept on some bench, so basically outside. It was pretty cold, windy an uncomfortable. The hostel has a big smell, humidity and cockroaches problem in the bath rooms. I've stayed in a lot of hostels all around the world, but never experienced such a situation like in The Medina Hostel Tanger. On top there was no refund granted for the second booked night, after my complaint. I defintely did not want to stay another night. The guy at the front desk was totally non-cooperative. Even though…",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2017,4,Good vibes!,"The Medina hostel is of course just a hostel; so don't get your hopes up too high. But it has a pleasant vibe and its a sociable experience. The place is quite clean, the staff is very helpful, and breakfast is delicious. The wifi was broken when I was there – that was a downside. The roof top terrace is very beautiful. It has a view across the medina. The dorms are a bit bleak, but it's good enough. If you're a solo traveler I recommend this place. Many other solo travelers go here, there is a lot of togetherness, people tend to want to chat with you. Enjoy!",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2017,4,Excellent value for money,"We stayed here for just one night. The rooms and bathrooms were both clean and tidy. Each bed had its own light and power point, which is a plus. The breakfast was standard moroccan with a variety of breads plus tea and coffee. We had a rough nights sleep as a group of guests turned up at 1 am and were complaining that they could not all sleep in the same room. This went on until 3 am, not very considerate.",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2017,1,WARNING: Concealed Black Moss,What a nightmare. It's a kind of cheap place you wish to never end up in unless there's no other choice and there wasn't. Staff are very nice but the management is either irresponsible or incapable of dealing with toxic black moss problem -- they just paint over it -- and the toxic effect on respitory system remains.,The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2017,5,2 night,"I spent two night in this hostel, it was amazing. Hostel is easy to find, clean and stuff was freindly. They have a delicious Moroccan breakfast. The terrassa has a beautiful sea and Medina view. Shukran Medina hostel",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2017,4,Easy to Find Hostel with Great Staff,"We only stayed one night but had a great experience. The hostel was easy to find, thanks to the signs leading the way.

 February 2017,5,Very helpful and friendly!,We had a few hours in Tangier before our flight in the evening and we walked in to leave our luggage there. The let us use all their facilities. From what I've seen the hostel is very clean and has a beautiful terrace. The stuff was very friendly and helpful.,The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2016,5,Perfect for Tangier Medina,"The medina hostel was a wonderful place to stay! Othman and Abdellah were welcoming and helpful hosts, the rooftop terrasse was nice and the rooms were very clean. In particular I will remember the evening talking to Abdellah. In him I found a genuine friend! He also recommended a hostel in Chefchaouen which was incredible as well. Thank you for making my stay in Tangier so memorable!",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Beautiful view from the rooftop, the rooms were clean and nice.",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2016,1,"Problems, rude and bad management","To be fair this hostel is beautiful with a fantastic view. But that's also to the only nice thing I can say about this place. We booked the cheapest room before arrival, but when we showed up, they had overbooked the hostel. Normally when you get and upgrade like this, you would just pay the amount, first agreed on, but not here. The guy in the reception told us, that we needed to pay extra for the room we did not booked. So extra money out of the Windows, for something we did not booked. The next day, we where told our originally so we moved room again. But it turns out they still are overbooked so there are no beds. I ask I the reception if there are any free beds. The answers was it wasn't his fault or problem, I could just ask around after an empty bed. So the overall…",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2016,5,Relax and Enjoy,"I really loved this hostel. It has such a fresh and relaxing atmosphere. It is relatively new, easy to find, and has a great staff. I stayed there for three nights just meeting fellow travelers to go wandering the city with. The rooftop is an excellent place to watch Tangier spill out around you. Great place for a solo travelers to meet and find adventure.",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2016,5,Best hostel I have ever stayed in!,"This hostel was absolutely fantastic, it was in a gorgeous building and very reasonably priced! There was a rooftop terrace which was a great place to take a bit of time out and enjoy the views of the city. The rooms were really nice and clean and they each had their own bathroom. An amazing breakfast was cooked for us every morning and the staff were fantastic. Although the streets of the Medina can be pretty hard to navigate there were plenty of signs to find the hostel. Would love to stay here again!",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2016,5,The greatest place in the Medina to feel like a local,"If you want to be near to local life in the Old Medina of Tangier don't miss this place, beautiful, secure, charming and well located. I will come back one day to have this delicious Moroccan breakfast on the terrace :) Abdellah Thank you for everything, you are the best example of local welcoming people!!",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2016,4,Had a great time!,"The Medina Hostel is a beautiful hostel with everything I needed and with alot more than what I expected. Good installations, good people and good food for a reasonable price. I recommend staying here, but there were also alot of people I met in Tangier that liked the Melting Pot Hostel as well!",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2016,3,Nice for Maroc standards,"This is a nice hostel for Maroc standards. Its a little hard to find, however there are street signs up everywhere. Its very cool inside, the internet works well - even from outside the front on the street. The neighbours are nice and will help out with information, even though they are private civilians. Mohammed at the reception was nice. For Marco standards the price of 130MAD per night is a little high.",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2016,5,friendly helpful wise place to start your marroco trip,"Personal in this hostel has helped us to navigate us towards what we wanted, without stress, acommodation in nice clean well equiped rooms, that offers luxury of personal boxes closable at lock. I very beatiful place to get quickly in touch with advantages of old city, services, and have your comfort in the mean time. Very quite place, offers breakfast one person always at information desk. Worth to ask anything about your plans in tanger",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2016,2,Needs work,"Average hostel. Does everything it's supposed to. Decent pricing with breakfast, warm enough in the off season. Rooftop has decent views of Tangier and the straits of Gibraltar. A little tricky to find, just keep your eyes peeled for the sprayed signs on the medina walls. Breakfast is OK, if sometimes served at erratic times. Internet works OK on lower levels, but speed is best in the common room. Not sure what to make of the locked doors policy at 11pm - makes it quite difficult if one wants to go out late at night to a bar or club. Was also warned to stay off the streets by the night watch at the hostel, so again, it makes me question the integrity of the Tangier medina and the hostel itself. Currently not recommended, better to head to melting pot or the like, until the…",The_Medina_Hostel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
