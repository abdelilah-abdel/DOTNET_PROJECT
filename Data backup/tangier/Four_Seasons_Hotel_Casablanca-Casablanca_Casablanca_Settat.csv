 November 2022,5,Definite Recommendation,"Wonderful time in Casablanca FourSeasons. The rooms were very good, crisp clean as you would expect from any FourSeasons. Complimentary water bottles were provided generously which made it really easy especially with my 3yr son. The location of hotel is great if you want to live away from crowd and enjoy your time near beach. ANFAMALL is right beside the hotel. Overall location and area of this place is excellent. Service was all good throughout. Except one time when I asked them to provide dental kit which never came. While checkout I complained about that and was provided with complimentary snacks and drinks which was satisfactory and the only flaw in service was compensated.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2022,5,One of the best Luxury Hotels,"Stayed at the four seasons Casablanca for 7 nights and it was truly one of the most luxurious beautiful hotels I’ve visited. Check in was brief and quick, our suite was truly immaculate - comfortable lounge and dining area full floor to ceiling windows with great views and a beautiful terrace - large tv with chromecast allowing you to watch your own devices on the tv. lovely teas and coffee (nespresso) a really nice touch is the Moroccan mint tea and the guide on how to make it in your room. The bathroom was exquisite marble with again floor to ceiling windows - a huge bathtub overlooking the beach and ocean, tv in the mirror and a separate walk in shower. The bedroom was spacious and a large comfortable bed (can choose your type of pillows etc) for the perfect nights sleep.…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2022,2,Four Seasons has lost its standards,I have stayed at many Four Seasons in different countries. The best was probably our 2 weeks extended stay at Landaa Giraavaru Maldives and am a big fan of the brand. The name Four Seasons has always been associated with quality but sadly not at the Four Seasons in Casablanca. We had booked 2 Mercedes V Class to collect us from the airport only to see that they had sent a 20-seater tour van to collect us which was filthy from the inside. This was the 1st red flag and little did we know that more bad surprises were to come. We got to the hotel at 4:30pm only to be told none of our 3 rooms (They had committed 2 connecting rooms and with the 3rd being on the same floor) were ready. We had been travelling for 14 hours and had our 3 kids with us so you can imagine how tired we were.…,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2022,2,Only one season…Winter,"On a rather rough and tumble appearing part of a beach that looks like Atlantic City boardwalk at its low point. The hotel has devices in the corridors to pump room scent that is as thick as a cloud…and available for purchase. At the pool deck a massive Jumbotron monitor is set to high illumination and continually repeats a one minute set of ads for the hotel. It is as bright as the surface of the sun and destroys the evening ambience of the property. The rooms are in need of a refresh, and the large tub in the bathroom begs the question, who bathers anymore?? The pool is frigid and unwelcoming and the jacuzzi is tepid, and hidden in the spa and you find out that you needed to make a reservation since only two people may use it at once. How awkward. I do not understand…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2022,1,Save your money,"this hotel is not up to snuff with other Four Seasons. The staff stood around and it took 4 staff members to make. tea. So confused.

 November 2022,4,Average,"We tried to book restaurant Bleu only to be told it was seasonal, you’re in Casablanca, there’s an ocean view from the hotel, surely seafood should be available all year round. Really disappointing. I did try and book a table via the website, they never replied, which given your reputation & price tag is poor, the communication needs to be improved. Nevertheless we went to the restaurant and it was lovely, the food tasted good, but I’ve had equally as good in far less established eateries with much better value. However, they showed lobster on the menu, only to be told when I was ordering it that it wasn’t available due to the season! Then the logical thing would be to remove it from the menu or tell your clientele that it’s not available prior to giving them the menu.

 October 2022,4,A Less Than Impressive Four Seasons,"My husband and I have stayed at Four Seasons properties all over the world, and have come to expect things you associate with the brand: attention to detail, impeccable service, and fabulous amenities. Sadly, for us, this property misses the mark. The good: check-in was quick, friendly and efficient. The hotel is on the beach and is within walking distance to good restaurants and excellent shopping. Our room was very nice and spacious and clean. That said, there were a few deferred maintenance issues in the bathroom that made it seem a bit rundown. The bad: the property doesn't serve alcohol, and we were told bringing in our own wine was against the rules. This was a bummer as we were there for three days.

Everyone had an early flight, we wanted to check in around 4:30 and have a nice dinner before going to the airport at 5 am. Our tour guide called the hotel 3 times- confirming or arrival. For two weeks this had worked! When we arrived, keys were ready and handed out with minimum waiting. It was a small tour-8 rooms. Upon arrival we found out that a previous group had come and they gave our rooms away. Four of those rooms already had people in the rooms. They asked our tour director if we could go to the stadium change, have dinner and the problem would be sorted out after our return from dinner.

All were good but quite surprised because there were plenty of staff around and the place was not busy as it was about 145pm. We were waiting in room to be ready. We got our room at 245pm, 15 mins before check in.

 September 2022,5,Great Stay and Beautiful Sunset,"We recently stayed at the Four Seasons here in Casablanca. The rooms were luxurious and quiet. The King bed we had was comfortable. The room size was more than adequate with a sitting area and a desk that was large. We had a decent sized balcony with an ocean view. The bathroom was large and ours came with a large tub. The shower was large and water pressure and temperature were fantastic. There was also a mini-fridge and safe in the room. The staff was excellent and helpful. I had forgot the safe combination in the room right before we were trying to leave to catch a train, and they came immediately and opened the safe.

They suggested I go to my room while they verified what happened to it. It wasn’t in my room. I waited in my room for 15 minutes. Nobody updated me. So I go back to reception.

Ever. We thought it was just because we were there during Ramadan, but no. I was surprised since there were several businessmen at the hotel and I would have thought they might want a cocktail. As for our room, it was lovely. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom spacious. Unfortunately, the walls were thin and we could hear the people with children next door.

The room was gorgeous, and the bed was very comfortable. The pool had most seats “reserved” for those who were there earlier… but they never came to use the chairs.

Every aspect of our stay was wonderful - being greeted as we exited our vehicle - checking in - relaxing in our room - partaking in the restaurant refreshments - and getting an amazing Hammam & Massage treatment.

I say that because the service was confused and inconsistent. Although to a person every employee was pleasant and appeared eager to please, they just could not execute. Asking for ice several times by phone or even in person was the minimum required to actually receive it. But when it does come, it is to chill the bottle of wine that cannot be had anywhere else on property (only in room and you must obtain it at a store in town).

The only thing I’d say however, is that that unlike other Four Seasons properties, the owners of this hotel did not get a liquor licence, so bring wine with you if you intend to drink.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2022,1,A nightmare,"For a Four Seasons, which is a high end brand this place was a disaster. It has a nice physical plant, but they are clearly understaffed and the people working there are in over their heads. Menu is limited, they still have no liquor license. Food was over cooked and cold at dinner. Hamburger was raw in the middle and fries soggy. No notice made of the fact that we barely touched our food. No help in the AM loading bags.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2022,5,Phenomenal experience,"This was my first trip to Morocco and I was alone in Casablanca. I felt welcomed, safe, and supported during my stay. The staff arranged for COVID-19 testing, transportation and answered all of my questions. Lalani was phenomenal and made my stay in Casablanca perfect.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2022,5,Wonderful experience at 4 Seasons Casablanca,This was our first trip to Morocco and Casablanca. We really did not know what to expect since we had not traveled to Morocco before. The 4 Seasons hotel was a great experience .I would highly recommend this hotel.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2022,4,Just good hotel,"We stayed 4 nights, property is well maintained. Good location next to the mall and on the beach. However beach is very dirty,rocky and not swimmable. Hotel has a nice pool. The whirlpool was not working. You need to keep asking for towels as there is no attendant at the pool. The pool phone was not working either. The restaurant on the property has limited food choices. Overall a good hotel,but not amazing..",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2022,4,Good visit,"Nice location on the ocean, rooms were spacious (we were on the south side of the building with partial ocean view), would have been nice to have a balcony to enjoy the ocean breeze but at least the large sliding glass windows opened. There was/is construction in the building next to us which was irritating at times. Breakfast buffet was good, extensive offerings, again with a nice view, Mustapha was very cordial. Spa team were also very pleasant and helpful. Slightly annoyed that we were going to a restaurant half a mile from the hotel and although there was a FS house car available there was a 200 MAD charge (versus 10 MAD for a taxi). This is a first for us for that service especially within such a short distance. Penny wise/pound foolish from the hotel?",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2022,5,away from the city on the beach,"It is a luxurious place to stay ,everything is high standard .2 minutes walking from a big mall ,hotel got his own entrance.

 March 2022,5,Great Hotel,"My wife and I spent one night at the Four Seasons Hotel, Casablanca. It was a great stay. The hotel is located on the Atlantic Ocean, not too far from the Great Mosque of Casablanca. Our room was excellent, large and well appointed. The bed was comfortable and the covers were clean and nice. The bath was large with a single sink. There was a separate shower (from the tub), which I appreciate. The room had a small frig, a coffee maker and a pot to make hot water for tea. It was easy to connect to the Internet and the speed was adequate. The restaurant was very adequate. They do not have a liquor license because of their proximity to the Great Mosque but they make some very nice non-alcoholic drinks. Overall, the staff was excellent. An excellent hotel and…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2021,5,Beautiful property and well-appointed rooms,"We did two stays (beginning and end of our tour) in September 2021 and had a great stay each time. The rooms have everything you need in them, water goes through an extensive purification process. The pool is beautiful and restaurant had great food and service. One of our servers at breakfast did the traditional tea service which was a fun way to start our trip!! We would absolutely stay again there and glad we had two stays there. The beach is lovely from afar, but once you get to the water, there is alot of trash that is left by the locals. There were a few bins but they were overflowing. NOTE: This is not a Four Seasons issue as this was a public beach but just an FYI.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2021,5,Luxury Stay in Morocco!,"Beautiful property, amazing service, excellent amenities. We utilized both the pool and spa with our mature children (17 and 21).

We had a pleasured stay in summer.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2021,3,"Definitely lacking the ""It"" factor","This hotel was the most underwhelming on our whole trip through Morocco. I felt like the hotel lacked charm, character. The service at reception was very cold, and I felt like we were a bother to them, rather than a welcomed guest. Same thing at breakfast. I felt like the service was clumsy, 3-star at best. The room also lacked character. Felt like you could be in any city in the world. No local charm or flavor. The location was excellent, but other than that, I would not return to this hotel, and can not recommend for others.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2021,5,Amazing Pool area,"I had a pool day pass and Mustapha and the life guard whose name I did not catch were fantastic, very polite and great service.

 October 2021,5,7 Star service,"We were a group of 12 women to celebrate my 40th & booked Four Seasons because we wanted a superb experience. There were several highlights, prior to arrival the reservation team was very communicative as well as the concierge pre-reserved dinner and spa. Upon arrival, I was given a complimentary room upgrade and proceeded to the spa where I had the best hammam experience ever. The service was great, rooms clean and beautiful and covid compliant. There was a lot of security which made us feel safe and they were very accommodating as well. The best part of the trip was the restaurant.

 September 2021,5,Spectacular views in Casablanca,"Four Seasons Casablanca is a very lovely hotel, typical of elegant Four Seasons, but in a Moroccan style. The views from the bar area are spectacular. We visited in September 2021, and the main restaurant was still closed, so we had dinner in the bar area.

 September 2021,5,Beautiful Hotel with Exceptional Service,My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel Casablanca for two stays (beginning and end of our tour) in September 2021 and had a great stay each time. The resort as many have stated is beautiful but I wanted to comment on the level of service. While I was busy my wife was looking to connect to a local business person. Charkie from Concierge not only got on the phone to call and translate for my wife but when he felt that the person wasn't being honest with her he advised her that she not leave the resort to meet him. He also coordinated our ride on the first day at the resort and explained to the driver what we wanted to see. This is the level of exceptional service you receive at this hotel. You also 100% feel safe here and being in a foreign country these days…,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Always a greeting and a smile from the bell hop, security, front desk, restaurant and spa staff. Food quality at the restaurants are very good. This resort does not serve alcohol. They do have Moctails and good tea selections. Our room is clean and spacious. Bath amenities are as usual with Four Seasons Resorts. Bed and pillows are comfortable. Wifi connection is strong and stable throughout the property. The bathroom is spacious but needs some updating. Looks a bit tired and fixtures don't operate smoothly. This resort has a swimming pool and direct access to the beach. The lobby is nicely decorated and has lots of areas to sit. Check in/out process is quick and easy.

 May 2021,5,Everything and More That You'd Expect from Four Seasons,"I had the good fortune to stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in early May during the last days of Ramadan and as Morocco was opening up to certain countries for travel. The hotel is located on the Atlantic Ocean with beautiful views of the sea. The Four seasons is just 10 minutes from the center of the city and is adjacent to Casablanca's Corniche, a lovely area where you can walk, and where you’ll find restaurants and beach clubs, and the public beach. The hotel’s expansive, lavish main rooms are stunningly decorated with modern Moroccan furnishings and fixtures, and a beautiful black marble floor. There are 156 luxurious guest rooms and 29 expansive suites, many overlooking the Atlantic coast.

 August 2021,2,"Beautiful hotel, great and friendly service, but (unfortunately) not recommended","As far as cleanliness, quality of the room, design of the hotel, exceptional friendly and helpfull staff, the team of Four Season Casablanca gets a score of 5 from me and my family. Additionally, the team handled the current corona-condition exceptionally well. There are 3 main reasons which drive this (probably unfairly low) score : 1. Absence of alcohol licence : the main reason for the selection of this hotel, was to be able to have a relaxing and joyfull holiday experience. To be able to have a glass of wine with diner, a beer/cocktail at the pool,... is in my opinion a crucial part of a joyful holiday in the sun. It is not mentioned on their website there is no alcohol licence.

 August 2021,5,By far Casablanca best Hotel,I fell in love with every little detail : - breakfast is amazingly savory one of the best ever (it’s A la carte but found it better than buffet as the service and staff are amazing as the hot is served hot and the fresh is served fresh you just need to ask for not serving all the items at the same time) - bathroom Bulgari Thé Bleu products are in my opinion the best I ever tried in a hotel (so far I was classifying Sofitel’s Lanvin as the best ones and also the former products at Hilton (Thomas Roth) - the beach/sea view from the room is relaxing especially by night (the fresh breeze and the waves sound during summer) - easy access to the beach from a very private pedestrian pavement - the central fireplace in the middle of the terrace Thank you for making my journey so…,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2021,1,Bad experience,"I thought it’s like all the four seasons in the world that I used to stay in however this one is a down grade to this big chaîne , Rooms are not clean properly specially in Covid time , less amenity , small swimming pool, dirty towels , the reception staff are so rude specially miss Aicha and Poor management .The only good thing was the afternoon tea and staff are amazing over there . and don’t deserve to be a 4 star hotel I will never stay in this hotel or recommending it to someone !!big no DISAPPOINTING !!!!!!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2021,4,Expected better,"Room was great. They upgraded us to a two room suite so my wife could do a zoom meeting in private. Had to take our meals in the open lounge area.

Everyone was business like, just thought there was a lack of the little extra polish",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2021,1,Incredibly disappointing,"Hotel and room not nearly clean enough for the price charged. No alcohol is served. This is not communicated at booking stage. Deceptive. Breakfast not included in standard room rate. Again, not communicated at booking stage. Food is flavourless. Swimming pool etc. does not feel luxurious. Feels very run down. Hotel is not actually in a great location of Casablanca; it's close to a beach McDonalds. Usually one can depend on the Four Seasons. This, however, was a very disappointing experience.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2020,4,Does not compare well to Four Seasons Marrakech,"After staying four nights at the Four Seasons Marrakech, I was very disappointed with this hotel as it is a night and day difference. The hotel appears old and not representative of the Four Seasons brand, more of a regular four star hotel. Don't get me wrong, the hotel is ok, but the Four Seasons hotels are not just regular hotels, but far and above better. We stayed here the second week of March during the Coronavirus Pandemic and were stressed out if we could go home or be stranded here. Immediately when we walked into our room, we notice the very foul moldy smell. We asked housekeeping to spray it, but we had a tough time sleeping. Whenever you opened the drawers, you could smell the musty smell. It felt very humid and for someone who works in insurance, this apparent…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2020,4,Great staff,"I chose this place as firstly it is a Four Seasons and secondly i love being on the Corniche in Casablanca with the ability to just stare at the crashing waves. Arrival was slick as to be expected at a Four Seasons. The staff were all absolutely on top of their game. The hotel is slightly sub par for a Four Seasons i would say. The room's aren't well sound proofed (tip maybe don't put an obviously business traveller in a room next to a young family - the noise from the crying kids was like being in the room with them), unless you book an ocean room all rooms are overlooking each other over the garden courtyard so lacking in privacy on the terraces.

 January 2020,3,Lovely property; service doesn’t feel like a Four Seasons,"Good location and physical plant. Service isn’t great. We arrived at 130 pm, checked in and asked if we could have a room of available. We were told no, no rooms are distributed prior to 3 pm. Seemed odd but ok. Came back at 3, 315, 330- each time room would be ready in 5 min. Finally got in at 345. Also surprised that guests cannot use tap water for Eg brushing teeth. Most hotels of this quality have filtered water. Even more surprised that there was no bottled water in bathroom. Service at lobby restaurant very slow even though not busy. Lots of little things that in total detracted from the experience.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,5,"Great hotel, great location!!","We are a family of 4 adults, stayed at Four Seasons Hotel in Casablanca for 2 nights in December 2019. Positives: 1. Upon arrival we were given a nice surprise with one of our rooms being upgraded to a suite. The suite had a huge bedroom, drawing room with a sitting area as well as a dining table, and a small kitchenette. There is another toilet attached to the living area. The other room which we had booked was of deluxe category, which was also extremely large. Both rooms were extremely spacious and well lit with two huge balconies attached to each. Bathrooms were huge and extremely comfortable with all amenities in place, with a separate shower cubicle as well as bath. Water bottles in the room are complimentary and are replenished whenever requested free of charge. 2.…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2020,5,Stellar enough service to overcome the lack of alcohol,"No hotel staff has ever gone so far out of its way to help us. My husband was injured (by our daughter, who scratched his cornea with an accidental flit of the wrist) on the flight in. The hotel found a doctor to meet us in our room, and the doorman went back and forth to the pharmacy for us to get appropriate medicine and supplies. Then, at every turn, the room service, housekeeping, concierge, and bell staff were accommodating and courteous. Furthermore, our room was gorgeous, and the room service breakfasts were wonderful and reasonably priced. The only downside to the hotel was the fact that it has no liquor license. Apparently, it was constructed too close to a mosque to be able to serve alcohol. I wonder whether Four Seasons read the no alcohol sales within X meters of a…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 December 2019,1,Wonderful hotel with exceptional location but awful customer service.,"I am directing this review specifically towards the terrace restaurant area. I have stated at this hotel in the past and was unimpressed it was not a memorable experience but without any significant negatives. Thus decided not to write a review back then, unfortunately my recent experience with guests foreign to Morocco was definitely a low point for me. The service was very not four seasons standard. I the food and coffee was definitely on point, but the bad service the long waits the inability to cater to our needs. I did try to approach the manager and explained to him that I have guests from out of town, he is reply was very disappointing, he simply said everyone is the same at the fourseasons. Who says that, even if this is the case as I would expect from this chain, the…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,5,Great hotel,"Excellent hotel on the beach, beautiful room with ocean view, very good food, although for breakfast you are expected to have the buffet; if you want something lighter you need to go to the smaller restaurant. Everyone was quite nice and friendly. The property is in a more contemporary part of town, next to a shopping area, with pleasant beachfront walking. If we didn't enjoy our stay more is because the city itself has little to offer beyond the Mosque.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The Four Seasons gave us all three. The service was first rate and the staff extremely accommodating. Special thanks to Kenza, the Guest Relations Manager, for her attention to detail in ensuring that every part of our stay was fantastic. You're Amazing. The view from our room of the surf rolling onto the shore was something my wife particularly enjoyed.

The service provided by the front desk was not at the 4S level, up on checkin it was robotic no feelings from the clerk(upgrade was not valued) ..if you ask about anything its always not them in charge.. my name on the final bill was totally wrong , and mantionning that i'm a ""Monsieur"" , even when i correct it for her she gave me the final invoice without correction. the bellboys were very helpful (special thanks goes to Younes who was very helpful ).

 November 2019,5,Tea Time ....... a true High Tea,"We went for tea and light pastries at the Four Seasons in Casablanca. This was an exquisite experience. Not only because of the wonderful tea (and coffee) and also the great cheesecake. It was by far also because of the phenomenal service. I apologize that I did not get the name of the server.

 February 2019,5,I am so pleased that I was able to stay here if only for one night.,"The hotel has beautiful flowers everywhere you look. The service is outstanding and very professional and accommodating. The hotel is on the ocean and I could see the surf from the very comfortable balcony. The food was outstanding.for dinner I had the best sea bass ever and the dessert choices made it difficult to choose. I had the profiteroles—delicious. A caveat, however, was that there is no alcohol allowed in the public areas. If you bring something in, you must drink it in your room.

Mr. Hicham with Guest Services was truly the highlight of our trip, he immediately upon our arrival went above and beyond to ensure that we were well taken care of throughout our entire stay. The rest of the staff was super accommodating, the place was beautiful and the food was pricey, but good enough for my finicky palate. The security personnel was on par with an embassy, making us feel super safe The only negative, would be the lack of alcohol, due to not having a liquor license...which was surprising....but they make up for it by providing great ""Mocktails"" I wouldn't think of staying…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2019,5,What a relaxing stay!,We stayed here on the start of our trip to Morocco. What a great start! The room was perfect as was food and beverage on property. The property exudes elegance. We weren't impressed with the beach it sits on - in fact it's very dirty. But the property itself was a treat! We had booked with Amex's Fine Hotels and Resorts which came with $100 dining credit and a space available upgrade. That credit was more than enough for our family of 4 to enjoy a Moroccan dinner in the blue restaurant. I'm not sure if the room was an upgrade or not but we liked it and were comfortable.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,4,Good hotel for business purposes,"Very nice hotel, with excellent food what is logic considering it's a 5 star hotel. More for short business trips then for spending a vacation. Noted some dissapointmens such as unpleasent smell in the room (probably due to humidity) and for some reason the cleaning lady came at 3 or 4 pm. Also there is no possibilty to stay at the beach due to beach line is very dirty and aslo no normal passage to the ocean. Also a lot of homeless cats, guess it's a general problem of the country. And yes, there's no alcohol served.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,5,A very nice stay but BYOB!,"We just spend three nights at this beautiful property and found it to be a wonderful hotel although the lack of alcoholic beverages is an issue. We had been forewarned so we stocked up on wine, beer, etc. so we were able to overcome that small issue. The hotel is well maintained, the seaside location excellent, although not necessarily walking distance to anything. The staff are all very well trained, polite, and professional. We had a few noise issues with our first room as it was located directly under one of the restaurants but they graciously moved us to a magnificent oceanfront suite which was much appreciated.

 August 2019,5,Very amazing hotel,Location of the hotel is near a mall and in front of sea. Restaurant are walkable. I would stay again in this hotel. security at hotel are high level. Employees are very friendly and helpful. They are very flexable with check in time. I arrived 5 hours before the check in time and the room was ready,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,5,Very Attentive Service,"This really is a beautiful hotel in a great location but this is really not our type of hotel. We'd been inland for so long that as coastal dwellers, we wanted to stay on the ocean for our last night in Morocco. The service was overly attentive and fussy, which some people probably love that, we are more low key. You cannot get alcohol at the hotel but there is a nice restaurant bar about 10 minutes walk up the road (toward the city/mosque) and we stopped there for a drink one afternoon and also dinner. You can walk to the mosque in Casablanca - took us about 30 minutes along the oceanfront.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2019,1,Worst Four Seasons Experience,I booked a superior room for 3 days.I was so excited to be in Casablanca but hotel's front desk ruined my vacation. Superior rooms that they have is on the second floor and looking at a wall there is no sun coming inside the room. I asked them to change my room but they said to me that this is the room you booked. I told them I did not booked a room with no view I would not mind looking at the parking area but the answer was a big no. I never had such experience in any hotel I will never book this hotel again,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2019,1,Terrible Hotel,We booked 3 single rooms at this hotel and once we arrived we received our rooms on second floor 243-247 and 249 which are the worst rooms because when you look out there is huge wall in front of you. We couldn’t get any sun shine inside the room. We spoke to the guest relations two days in row to change our rooms but they had their excuses etc. Out of 3 rooms we had the worst one given to our guest who we brought. We spoke with guest relation manager Ms Kenza and asked her to get at least one room at upper floor for our guest and she said that she will organize the room and let us know in the afternoon so We told our guest to pack he will be moving out of his room so he packed. They even said that we should pack and leave the luggage in the room they will bring it to his new…,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The selection of prepared foods was over the top.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,5,A top Class Hotel,"The rooms were large, luxurious and of high specification and were very clean. The linen was of great quality and clean. The towels were fluffy white and not overused. The selection of toiletries was wonderful. The Staff were incredibly friendly. The restaurant food was excellent and full of flavour but a wider menu with greater English descriptions would have been helpful. The restaurant Bleu was also wonderful. There were no alcoholic drinks and so the non-alcoholic options could have been greater. The pool area was beautiful and so too was the pool restaurant. We made use of the Four Seasons Application and that made the engagement with hotel staff so much easier.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,5,Great Moroccan hospitality,"The breakfast offering is definitely “stand out”.The service was excellent as usual.Mohammed the host at Bleu is just outstanding-he makes the hotel special. Every guest should experience him-always professional, always obliging never too friendly!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2019,3,2 nights in first week of September,"Very nice decor, bedrooms are very nice and reception areas very smart. Downsides ...... aircon needs improving, rooms feel humid and a little damp. I know it is by the sea but could be better ventilated. Breakfast area is always too hot, too humid, not enough air con. No cafe/ coffee options in receptions areas while breakfast is open ...... a little poor for a For Seasons Hotel. And I know it’s not the fault of the hotel but it is a little frustrating that it’s a ‘dry’ hotel (no alcohol) even in the bedrooms!!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,5,Modern beach side elegance,"Modern, clean and stylish, the Four Seasons Casablanca has decent restaurants, and an amazing view of the ocean (and sunsets).

 June 2019,4,Rehrom,Lovely hotel with super service. Its Well located. The spa and swimming pool are excellent. It has a public beach which is well used by locals early in the morning there's a lot of seaweed and too many Rocks to enjoy the beach when we were there the seawater temperature was way too cold! It is a dry hotel so alcohol is not permitted or served - a sunset cocktail would have been welcomed!!,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,4,Below Average for Four Seasons,"Although the hotel was nicely located on the ocean, and staff were service-oriented and approachable, the entire stay in general doesn't live up to Four Seasons' standards. - Great bedding quality - Designer toiletries (BVLGARI's) - For In-room dining, food was good and so the service. - The pool is relatively small with few lounge chairs, which are always occupied in high seasons. - No alcohol served in premise. A bit unusual for such upscale hotel chain in Morocco. I wouldn't stay here again for those two downsides. Otherwise, it's good place to stay for the service and comfort.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 August 2019,4,Good Location,"The Four Seasons Casablanca is located in the heart of the 'Boulevard de la Corniche', and offers a wonderful ocean view, with breathtaking sunsets. As any other Four Season, the staff was helpful and knowledgable about various touristic activities and services. The spa didn't live up to our expectations as it was pretty small and didn't offer many services, and nonetheless the outdoor pool was nice and relaxing, I felt that the water temperature was a little low, considering the cold climate. Food was tasty, although the Tajine wasn't very good, however, smoothies were great. Overall, we had a wonderful break at Casablanca and enjoyed our stay at the Four Seasons.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,4,Smoking hot,"The four seasons is a good 5star hotel, however compared to other Four Seasons, this one seems to be below average. The hotel is 4-5 years old, but it feels older. Design of the hotel doesn’t have a modern feel, the maintenance of the hotel shows it cracks and the fact that you can smoke anywhere makes it unpleasant. Everywhere in the world it’s becoming more restrictive to snake in public places, but in Morocco and also in Four Seasons hotel people smoke wherever they feel like, including in the rooms and at the pool. The food prepared was delicious, but the standard was different every day. We experienced it as being very tasty, but the way it was served and what was served with it was every day different. The staff is service minded and helpful, but not knowledgeable…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 June 2019,4,Close to excellent but not quite,"We liked this hotel. Staff and everyone were very accommodating and helpful. Service was up to four seasons standard and the views of the ocean were amazing. The room was ok for FS resort. There was a strong mildew smell coming from the drawers that needs to be fixed and the cleaning of the bathroom when we got the room was not up to four seasons standard. There were stains and water marks on the walls which was quite off putting. Four Seasons should not have these imperfections. One big problem with this hotel is they do NOT have alcohol, this is likely the only FS resort in the world where you can not have a glass of wine with dinner. I am sure somebody lost their job over that screw up. Anyways, overall a very decent hotel that could be improved by the noted points to meet FS…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The terrasse of the mint offers an amazing view of the gardens and the sea, while sipping on one of the teas selection they offer. The pool area and bar is where we spend most of our time, the menu is exquisite! Pizza or gaspacho by the pool everything was just perfect! Two nights was not enough!

 June 2019,3,Not Up to the Four Seasons Standard,"There were many features that were what one would expect from a Four Seasons hotel. The property was beautiful with stunning views of the beach and sunsets. Food was good, rooms were nice and well-appointed (but very dark) and service was good, but a bit slow. Casablanca and this hotel were our first stop in Morocco, so I thought that the slowness was just the way things are in Morocco, just a little more laid back as can be typical in many hot climates; however, that was not the case. Everywhere else we went, including other places in Casablanca, had prompter service than this Four Seasons did. So some cons were: - service wasn’t very prompt - our room was very dark - our room was billed as having “courtyard” view; however, we actually had a view of the entrance courtyard…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2019,5,Elegant City Hotel,Our first and lat nights in Morocco were spent here. A great way to start and end a trip. The hotel lives up to its reputation and really is special.

 June 2019,3,This hotel reminded me of a phrase from my high school French class: comme ci comme ca!,"We stayed here for one night before our departure home after 10 days in Morocco. Upon reflection, this is really a nice Hilton with a good pool masquerading as a Four Seasons! It is not up to Four Seasons standards. We had been assured by the concierge that a taxi driver with our name on a sign would greet us at the Casablanca train station. When that did not happen, we knew we were not in four a real Four Seasons experience. You enter the hotel at the reception level which is actually the top floor. It is dark, a bit dated and has zero ""wow"" factor. The ceilings are very low and it feels somewhat claustrophobic. We did not receive our promised room category upgrade as Virtuoso members. We had been assured our room would be non-smoking, but as soon as we walked in, the smell of…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We spent two wonderful days at the hotel. Everything was first class. The hotel is beautiful with great views of the ocean. The concierge staff was great answering all our questions before we arrived. Thanks to Saad. They arranged our airport transfer and we did the Fast Track. Make sure you do this as you will zip right through the airport- otherwise the waits for customs can take hours.

 May 2019,5,Perfection You Expect,"Our recent journey to Morocco and the decision to stay somewhere where we would both enjoy and explore... This was an easy one. The Four Seasons Casablanca is the place. Everything you expect froma Four Seasons and then some. From check-in to check-out, we had one snag and it was the hotel car service (which I highly recommend). I think the measures of making you feel secure while staying here are top notch. Our room was a corner suite overlooking the beautiful beach with crashing waves (the weather was so nice, we left the glass walls/doors open while we were there awake) and looking down the coast to the beautiful mosque every morning to the unmeasurable sunsets every evening made the trip all the more special to watch the gatherings of people for Ramadan prayer and then…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2019,5,A grand reception,The reception team from the valet to The room escort is just absolutely amazing.I have visited this property several times and the reception team is consistently great.

 May 2019,4,Hotel should review restaurant hours,"States for one night at the beginning of our Morocco trip.

Either the restaurants are not open long enough hours, or the dining options were not properly explained.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2019,1,This can't be a Four Seasons hotel,"Go experience it for yourself. You will get better service at any mid-level chain hotel in USA. BTW it is a dry (no alcohol ) property. There are definitely better choices in Casablanca. If you just go by the name's reputation, you will be disappointed. Very spacious room and a great bed though.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,5,Our stay at four seasons,"Where do I even start. This was our first time at a four seasons. As soon as we got there we were greeted from each and every individual. One of the members of the team really stuck out to us. The gentleman by the name of radouan was outstanding. Every single morning my girlfriend and I were greeted with a smile on his face. He went out of his way everyday to make sure we had the best stay. Aside from the people there being outstanding, the hotel had spoke for itself. From the outside, it was absolutely breathtaking. As you walk in, the decor is incredible. Everything is picture perfect. The hotel was always clean and rooms were always spotless.

 April 2019,4,Luxurious,"My recent stay at the Four Seasons Casablanca in one word was luxurious. The views were stunning, the rooms were so comfortable and well maintained, luxury is the word that comes to mind. There were so many choices for breakfast to suit every taste and everything tasted great. The views at breakfast were also stunning. The staff was so helpful and everyone was friendly. The only issues I encountered were the lack of an iron in the room and the dinner we ate there was a bit of a disappointment for some in my party. At a luxury hotel there should be an iron in the room. Period. And truth be told, the fish at dinner was under-seasoned, even though my crab salad was superb and so was my lamb. I would stay there again next time I am Casablanca.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,5,Great hotel. Great breakfast. Do not expect too much from other meals.,"This hotel is great, in terms of the bedrooms, big and comfortable. It has a luxury touch and the location, over the sea is wonderful. The beach is not really good to get into the sand or the water, but it is always relaxing to look into the sea. Breakfast has to be one of the best I have ever been to: on quality and variety. Surprisingly, other meals were a bit disappointed and the hotel doesnot serve alcool, which limits a good dinner for me. But other thanthat limitation, I would definitely recommend.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,5,Stay at Four Seasons Casablanca,"Truly a wonderful experience at the Four Seasons. The staff, as typical of a Four Seasons, was truly exemplary.

If you are staying in Casablanca, there is no better choice.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,4,Great View for breakfast,"Seated next to the beach , the Four Season in Casablanca is one of the best modern hotel in the famous city . Not all rooms are facing the ocean . The breakfast restaurant does have a panoramic view of the sea . It is one of the delights of a trip to start the day with a leisurely breakfast overlooking the Atlantic and pondering about how much better life can be . Breakfast is not cheap by local standard . 320DHR. But worth the experience . The rooms are ..... well.. So Lala. But the beds are very comfortable and after a week galavanting within the interior of Morocco, it is indeed a welcome luxury no matter what .",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The price is in the four seasons range but not the services On the plus side they have great room, great breakfast, good food at the restaurant blue, friendly staff On the minus side, no alcohol (not even wine), super expensive breakfast (even tough good), booking taxi from the voiturier always led to ripoff (taxi never activate the counter and you end up paying 2 to 3 times the trip), transport of the hotel from airport super expensive if you need a van (1600 MAD for the Van, 800 MAD for an Audi A6. A normal taxi would cost 300 MAD), I would have given a 4 TripAdvisor star if this hotel was a 4 star but for a 5 star I would have expected more.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Service is impeccable--they anticipate your needs and do so with professionalism and a smile. The breakfast was diverse and of high quality. The lunch menu and cafe areas were also great.

Note: they do not serve alcohol.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,4,A very nice choice of hote,The Four Seasons Hotel in Casablanca is beautifully situated at the shore of Anfa in Casablanca. Casablanca is Morocco’s biggest city and probably not that known mongst tourists as Marracech. The room (King Superior) was big with balcony. Room service was impeccable.

 April 2019,1,Does not meet the standards of the Four Seasons Brand,"Once again I have to be disappointed with the Four Seasons in Morocco. I have been siting in the lobby for close to an hour waiting for my room which was suppose to be ready in 10min. After being escorted to the lobby reception for a welcome drink, I was left there for close to an hour and was asked to pay for the drink by the waiter since the people at the front desk could not be bothered to communicate that it would be complimentary. The waiter even followed me to the front desk to make sure I wouldn’t leave without paying.. NOTHING WORSE.. then starting off a stay with a TERRIBLE check in experience!

 March 2019,4,Great place to stay !,"Stayed couple of nights here in the lap of luxury- huge rooms and equally huge bathrooms! The service was excellent to the extent that you feel pampered! However couple of things that need tweaking are check in process and room service menu . Though I reached the hotel at 3 pm , I was allotted my room only around 4 pm and I found the room service menu a bit uninteresting.

 January 2019,4,Beautiful new hotel but location is interesting,Hotel is brand new and the rooms are beyond big. Impeccable design to the hotel with fine amenities and right on the beach. Really the only hotel I would choose in Casablanca. It only unfortunate part is that it's right off the main street/highway. One strange example is eating in the restaurant you get a view of the beach and also the main artery with the McDonald's and all the construction cranes in the distance. It's a city under massive building phase. That said no other real place to stay in the city frankly.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

But the Four Seasons looked like the nicest beach front hotel, so I decided to stay. From the first moment I stepped out of my car, I was greeted by friendly staff who escorted me to the lobby, and then escorted by another friendly staff member straight to the check in desk. For the next four days, it was the best service and hotel experience I have ever had in my life.

Sometimes great sometimes disappointing a tad pretentious and short of staple dishes. No alcohol makes it a bit sad ( they can’t get a liquor licence supposedly because of proximity To mosque). So bring your own beers or whine that you need to drink in your room a shame really as otherwise it would be great with a busier and this better restaurant So I won’t be going back next time I’ll try Hyatt or the new Barcello ( not the old one,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Everyone we walked by and interacted with acknowledged us, even remembering our names, and made sure we were well looked after. The reception area, lobby, restaurants, outside seating areas and rooms are spectacular and the property is situated right on the ocean. The only minor downside is that the property is not licensed to serve alcohol. If you wanted a glass of wine you could purchase a bottle and take back to your room or go to other restaurants close by. This inconvenience should not distract from the hotel and serve merely as information. In closing, congratulations…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The guest rooms are stunning and the most comfortable beds ever! The hotel is situated on the ocean which is a bonus as well. The banquet staff did an outstanding job with my group.

 November 2018,5,Best hotel upon arrival,"This proved to be the right choice for our first hotel upon arrival in Morocco and need recover from jet lag and unwind. Casablanca is a crowded bustling city with many hotels but newly constructed Four Seasons is in an attractive less dense area with ocean frontage and scenic views. Interior decor, on site dining and breakfast buffet is top notch. We booked a premier partial ocean view room and then saw and was misled by an online negative review complaining that the view was into a McDonalds and public beach entrance, so we requested and were assigned an inner courtyard room with some partial ocean view. However, the McDonalds, although visible is a long distance away and there is plenty of good view on that side. Although there is presently no wine or liquor, I…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,Wonderful property,"We have always been very impressed with the Four Seasons hotels that we have been fortunate enough to stay in and the Casablanca property is no exception. Located directly on the beach in Casablanca the view from our balcony was amazing and the property itself is modern, crisp and a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle of Morocco - an oasis. We experienced only one issue during our stay and that was with the accuracy of our room service orders arriving consistently with small errors. Customer service being a hallmark of the Four Seasons brand, all matters were dealt with immediately and to our satisfaction.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2019,3,Didn’t meet the expectations,"We have stayed in Four seasons in January 2019. The location is quite good, and the hotel has friendly stuff. However, the hotel has some drawbacks: 1) the stuff was very confused with the laundry, we asked them to pick up the laundry abd they came up to clean the room and left the laundry untouched 2) spa was 3/5, the therapist was unable to make proper waxing and properly remove make-up during the facial. 3) no wine served in the restaurant. The overall experience is that you do not feel pumpered, but rather ripped off.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

But when we arrived to Four Seasons Casablanca - we were very disappointed. We arrived to the hotel noon time after a long journey, and our room wasn’t ready yet. The receptionist asked us to wait in the lobby and have some drinks while they are preparing the room. We ordered some salad, and vegetarian-couscous . It took30 min for each dish to get to our table, and the waiter also forgot to bring us our drinks. When we finished lunch, i asked the waiter to bring us morrocan tea.

Our junior suite is very modern, stylish, and clean. The beach is nice to walk but not swim. That’s okay because we didn’t come here for a beach vacation.

Bed slept very comfortable and linens were wonderful. Lovely to have the coffee service in the room since I rise earlier than my husband. To the Politics/Religon of the license - The Saudi Arabian Prince was gifted a palace with an adjoining mosque less than a mile from the hotel.

The hotel is a great mix of urban trendy and contemporary chic, with international flair and local touches. The atmosphere is classy, yet not distant. Great public spaces and nice decoration, yet not anonymous. The inner patio is very quiet and the pool area is well designed.

Spacious bathrooms, one with a free standing modern soaking tub and rose petal bath salts. There were coffee and tea sets in each room and complimentary treats set out for the children. The hotel has a modern moroccan vs. traditional design aesthetic. The staff was very helpful. Beautiful views of the ocean and easy proximity to the Hassan II mosque, although it is not a very walkable area, so plan to take taxis anywhere you wish to go.

We ate at the restaurant and my oldest daughter was threw up exactly 3 hours after eating the food. Once she threw everything up, she was fine. Classic food poisoning. We hadn't eaten anything else from the area (we brought peanut butter from home and had peanut butter sandwiches for lunch and we had breads for breakfast) so I knew the food poisoning was from the restaurant. Then, the manager of the restaurant offered to send us sparking water and when we received it, the hotel tried to charge us for it!

The next day, we asked where the nearest hospital was, and the front desk said no need to go to a hospital, they would send a doctor. The doctor arrived within an hour. It was amazing. He treated me and wrote me several prescriptions. The hotel directed us to a pharmacy to fill them. I was ill the three nights we were there, so I can't comment on anything at the hotel as we could not enjoy the pool or restaurants. They all looked lovely, though.

Was occupied by hundreds of youths playing soccer games on Sunday morning Yes folks, hotel has no liquor license, so plan accordingly if you enjoy a pre- or post-dinner schnapps. Our tour company flagged the zero alcohol in hotel so we purchased our schnapps at duty-free in Madrid airport prior to flight.

Outstanding breakfast buffet, including a large Moroccan offering, as good a breakfast as anywhere we have been! Mehdi our server was genuinely friendly and helpful and also full of information when asked. The only reason to not give 5 stars is because they do not have a liquor license, waiting 3 years already they said!

Standard room and bathroom were modern and of a nice size. Staff was all friendly and attentive. Breakfast buffet was the best of our 6 hotels through Morocco. The only thing that we found strange was that we were unable to relax in the sun by the pool area and we were the only ones there! All of the soft seating had the pads removed as we were told that they were putting away the seating for the winter.

The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is very spacious. Toiletries were very nice. We had dinner at Mint both nights - we sat on the terrace where we saw a beautiful sunset. The flowers displayed throughout the hotel are exceptionally beautiful. The pool area is lovely as is the outdoor restaurant on the pool level. The breakfast buffet was very nice. The view of the water from the hotel is great - however the beach itself is very dirty and the water is rough.

 October 2018,4,Wonderful hotel,"The Four Seasons in Casablanca is really a wonderful hotel. The team here are well trained, attentive and ever helpful. Its more like the city lets the hotel down. It took over an hour to clear immigration and customs which I am told by the locals is very normal. The beach in front of the hotel being a public beach is not in very good condition which is a shame. Do a half day private guided tour and you will cover all the main attractions. The private guide arranged by the hotel was good. The Hassan II mosque being one of grandest modern mosques you will most probably see in your life.

The place is very well thought through, and offer beautiful views on the sea (esp. Mint and Bleu restaurants). The staff is very wellcoming and friendly. Food is quite good (esp. brunch on Sunday and grilled fish in general). That said, several rooms are noisy or let's say noiser than what you are used too with Four Seasons standards (esp. if there is a connection with another room - you can hear the TV - or if the room is close to a service entry - door keeps clapping). Maintenance and cleaning is not done consistently (walls damaged, door knobs dirty), which again is below standard at that level. Lastly, this was better at the start and got like this recently.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

All rooms have a sliding glass door for fresh air and most are an obliquely ‘sea view’. The rooms are big and staff helpful as noted elsewhere. The Moroccan reserve might be misinterpreted as indifference but once engaged over their language one sees an animated eagerness to please. The food here is superb and offers wonderful Moroccan tastes and variety but we did go elsewhere like to Ricks Cafe and La Squala which are near each other. Walk the old Medina early before the foreigners on big cruise ships invade! The people ignored us as they shopped for the days vegetables and bread-no panhandlers or beggars.

Previous reviews I had read suggested the place was immaculate in terms of interior design, and the service was exemplary. From my experience, those reviews were dead on. Upon checking in, I was told my room wasn't ready yet and the staff very pleasantly suggested for me to take a seat and relax. I immediately took a seat on the balcony and was offered a selection of complimentary fine tea as I waited. Once my room, which had a partial ocean view, was ready, I went my room and it was immaculate and had an incredible amount of space.

There is so much missing that my list is exhaustive, pretty much like the stay, exhausting. Here's a few ...

They had the first but not the second. They helped rectify the issue and everything else was top notch - as usual.

In room food was heavy, over cooked and very slow, we almost gave and the hotel had no alcohol and no help finding a stre to get it, so no wine for the 3 meals we had there. Door staff got us a taxi to the souk which was what we ask d for. They said pay meter, about 59 Durham. When we started driving we found no meter and the guy tried to take us to his friend oil shop and told us we had rented him for 4 hours.

Some furniture is made of fake wood and the views to the musty facade of the nieghbouring building does not keep up to a Four Seasons Standard. Nevertheless, the rooms are very big and clean. Service is friendly and attentive, e.g. adding glasses wipe to your specs case.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2018,5,Luxury on the ocean.,"While the souks and city may be feeling a little rough, this hotel left us feeling fresh and pampered. Wonderful breakfast buffet and every amenity except wine (understandably per religious adherence) that you could hope for!

 September 2018,5,CASABLANCA - AN UNEXPECTED DELIGHT,"The city of Casablanca is indeed an unexpected delight. It is cool, calm, and collected - well groomed, manicured, and sedately located on the Atlantic Ocean in Morocco. Casablanca is the primary gateway city to the country. Without question, in this travelers opinion, the Four Seasons Casablanca is the only place to stay when visiting. It is located in a friendly seaside neighborhood and easily accessible to 'downtown'. You escape the maddening crowds at this elegant property that boasts every amenity that you could possibly need. A gentle fragrance greets every guest. The property is quiet despite myriad of guests in the guest areas. It is as if everyone respects the ambiance that Four Seasons Casablanca creates. From most every vantage point, one sees the Atlantic Ocean…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2018,4,Appling service spoils great location,"Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the gentlemen at the door/ front entrance and assisted with our luggage. We were directed to the reception to check in. The gentleman at reception was arrogant and rude. He failed to extend any form of greeting or welcome. He did not provide any details of breakfast options or any other suggestions as one would expect. I asked him if they had a buffet breakfast and he said it was from 7.30am to 11.30am. He behaved in a manner that felt as though he was doing us a favour. We arranged with him for an additional bed which was supposed to have arrived the first night. Following two trips to the reception to query the arrival of the extra bed, it eventually arrived on our last evening which was pointless! There was no apology or explanation…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 August 2018,5,Beautiful Property and Excellent Service Recovery,"I stayed at the Four Seasons for 2 nights, 1 at the beginning of my trip and one at the end, 9 days later. The property is modern, excellent location in the heart of the ‘Beverly Hills’ area of Casablanca and very close to the Mosque and next door to a mall. You have the beach and sea on your doorstep and they make the most of the views in the communal areas and some of the rooms. I think the hotel is only 2 years old so the decor is stunning and very in keeping with Moroccan design. I loved the outdoor area near the lounge, seriously beautiful spot to relax and eat, or grab a drink.

The room was spacious and clean. The quality of the breakfast buffet is outstanding. It offers Moroccan, Continental and much more. It's very complete with a nice choice of honey for example. The front hostess made sure that I was comfortable with the table spot and walked me through the dishes. My breakfast experience was very pleasant as I was assisted by a Spanish speaking waiter named Moustapha, who was extremely friendly and professional.

 July 2018,4,Surely the best hotel in Casablanca. Except that it's dry.,"After staying in the Four Seasons in Marrakech, which was totally on point for the service if not the quality of the fixtures and fittings, arriving at Four Seasons Casablanca restored our faith - it's beautifully done with first class appointments, built-to-last quality and the understated flair Four Seasons does so well. It's well located - close to the beach clubs and good sea-facing restaurants, and easy to get around from . The hotel's a bit of a bunker in design terms, but it functions well for guests. The rooms are large and lovely, gorgeous large marble bathrooms, wonderful bed and sumptuous decor. Sea-view rooms do have a angled sea view, but you do overlook the rooms opposite.

Not being at all familiar with Morocco, we decided to splurge and stay at 4 Seasons. One of my best experiences in 30 years traveling was 4 Seasons Macau. Not here. We have a teenager traveling with us so needed a rollaway bed. That took 35 minutes and 3 visits/calls to the front desk. The next day calling for an iron, some ice and tonic water...more delays and drama. Coffee and croissant for light breakfast, more drama and delay. I.must say there are pockets of excellence.

 July 2018,5,Pleasant stay,"The Four Seasons Casablanca is an interesting place. We booked an 8-day stay beginning July hoping to relax, enjoy the sun, be close to the ocean and do some cultural excursions. Prices were low for Four Seasons' standards. The hotel is on the ocean front with direct access to a public beach but no hotel service on the beach. The hotel has a beautiful garden with swimming pool, pool restaurant and comfortable lounge chairs. The hotel is apparently used predominantly by business travelers. Hence we found ourselves often alone on the lounge chairs around the pool. Great feeling not to have to fight to get a chair. We would arrive calmly around 11am and find the pool almost empty. Personnel and lifeguard always on duty. Pleasant detail: around the pool 5 private rooms are available…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

If we had started the trip here and then went to the riads, we would have not enjoyed the riads as much. The service was excellent (as expected). The eating areas good, including the outdoor seating looking at the sunset. Food was very good and a nice departure from strictly Moroccan fare.

At 5 am on June 27 there was extremly loud music playing right in front of the hotel for TWO HOURS continuously which woke everyone up and despite the complaints from everyone in the hotel, it didnt stop. The disturbing music was for a running event of 20 PEOPLE who decided to play LOUD CLUB MUSIC right infront of the best hotel in Casablanca at 5 am despite the abundance of non residential beaches. The breakfast buffet was full at 7:30 am and everyone looked so angry (I wonder why). We had to sit through hours of this as if we weren't in a 5 star hotel. It was just all so unnecessary.

The rooms are ultra modern with huge state of the art bathrooms, and I mean plural, great bedside lighting to read by, and welcoming drinks and tidbits and more. To top it all off is a phenomenal included buffet breakfast, the size, quality and offerings that dazzle one’s eyes.

 June 2018,5,Business trip for one week,Simply outstanding customer service ....... rarely impressed by the level of service at many supposed 5 star hotels but this hotel is truly excellent. Only small drawback is that it is not licensed to sell alcohol - although the Villa Blanca just 5 mins walk away has a really nice bar. Highly recommend the Four Seasons -only very slightly more than the Sofitel but many times better.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Only nice hotel on the beach and within walking distance of shops and restaurants. The staff was awesome and all spoke English. This is a good hotel to stay at so you can ease your way into the city and the Muslim culture. They were good at restaurant recommendations and setting up our taxi rides. Tip, have the hotel order you a grand taxi. The red petite cabs do not like to use their meters so they can charge you anything they want. Also, this hotel does not serve alcohol due to its proximity to two mosques.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 May 2018,5,Nice location,"The Four Seasons is located on the water and one can hear the waves crashing from the balcony. Service was as expected at a Four Season Hotel, friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet is huge and a lot of choices so no one should complain. The only down side to this hotel is that it does not have a liqour license so there is no wine with dinner. A 3 minute walk down the street though ,and opposite McDonald's, is Cafe Bianca that has beer, wine, cocktails and good food at reasonable prices. A 15 minute taxi ride from the hotel is a hidden gem of a restaurant Le Rouget de I'Isle. Great food and service.

Turn down not done until after 9pm the first night. No liquor license and not informed pre booking.

The entire hotel team is amazing and lovely to interact with. I swear they thought of everything before I had a chance to ask. As a person with a lot of food allergies, I appreciated how many options they had and how willing they were to accommodate. I loved the spa and the gym.

 March 2018,5,Mourad,"I'm frequent traveler to Casablanca, I've only one hotel, Four Seasons, it's : Excellent Hotel and rooms, Has an excellent Location, beach, restaurant mall. Has excellent staff services. Variety of Restaurants near the Hotel.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2018,5,Even more than we expected (and we expect a lot)!,"We ended our stay in Morocco with a one night stay at the Four Seasons before a flight out the next morning. Everything was as we expected through the Four Seasons name (we have stayed at six other properties over the last few years). A relaxing way to spend a night before traveling home. However, strikes at AirFrance threw a wrench into our plans. The concierge staff at the hotel helped us immensely in our efforts to re-book the flights, turning a two hour marathon into a breeze. It was great to have the help at a stressful time, but that is what you expect at the Four Seasons. They always go out of their way to help their customers. We will definitely be back.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,4,"Atypical for a Four Seasons, but that isn't necessarily bad.","This is an interesting combination of chain aesthetic and local influence. First, there's no liquor license (and despite the hotel's implications that it might be pending, I was told that they build too close to a mosque and that isn't likely to change). The rooms with ocean views are terrific. Many others are a little far back from the ocean and, while the interiors are every bit up to Four Seasons standards, the views and balconies feel less private and lack the context of Casablanca. Great spa, gym and very nice restaurant, although the concierge tried to discourage me from dining there (saying it was fully booked, but I then asked the restaurant itself and they had no trouble accommodating me, the only diner for the first hour I was there, and one of only four tables filled…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2018,5,"Finally, real luxury.","Located next to a shopping mall in an upmarket neighborhood, and nicely removed from the city, the Four Seasons Hotel Casablanca is a refuge from the madness of Morocco. After two weeks of luxury riads and dars, it is nice to come back to a real luxury hotel where the expected standards of luxury are met. Strong wifi signal, complimentary bottled water, bright sunlit public areas, and a full buffet breakfast spread. No doubt, dars and riads are quite the things to experience while in Morocco, but once you are done with them, nothing beats coming back to the Four Seasons.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2018,4,Good place to stay,"Good place, great views, the food is good, it is a good place to stay in Casablanca. The service is ok, the architecture is very nice. The rooms are big, the majority of the rooms don’t have views, that’s why I can’t rate it with a five.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,2,"Booked 3 nights, leaving after the first","We arrived at 13.15 and had to wait until 16:15 to check in. Booked a table for dinner at 19.30, but the table was not set half an hour later. Asked for a dish without parsley due to my allergy, and the answer was “Impossible, madam, such dish would not be tasty!”. Assured us the pool is heated, but it’s freezing cold. The spa receptionist offered just one option for massage for two days ahead. We had to ask twice and even more for any simple request. Slow and not effective service, only part views of the ocean from all rooms (and only top floors). Do not recommend going there.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,5,The location is stunning.,Right on the Atlantic Ocean!! The location is stunning. The spa is spectacular and the gym is one of the best equipped hotel gyms I’ve even experienced. The room are amazingly spacious. The lack of alcohol is a bit of a damper but not the end of the world. The staff are superb!,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 February 2018,5,Four Seasons Casa Blanca---great concierge staff,"arrived CB late evening, planning to take train to Marrakech the next day--bad idea, very slow. Casa Blanca Four Seasons Concierge Staff very accommodating and proactive in finding quality local rental car company, who sent representative to hotel w car. And the adventure began...great service!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,5,Great hotel,"Stayed one week and overall property is very good. Service is (almost) impeccable although not on par with similar hotels in place such as Doha (e.g., room clang occasionally forgetting to replace minor things). The buffet breakfast is very good. The Moroccan restaurant is good but the choice if the menu is way too limited, not even a chicken pastilla!!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,4,NICE HOTEL,"Only stayed one night. Nice and new hotel in a good location. The usual excellent Four Seasons service with a friendly Morrocan touch. Rooms are beautiful and confortable as well as bathrooms although amenities are on the poor side. I found the architecture strange. Although it is literally on the beach, very few rooms have a direct sea view. Two buildings facing each other over a small courtyard and only from the balcony you can catch a side glimpse of the ocean. On the other hand you have a perfect view of what is going on in the rooms opposite....so much for privacy. Some may dislike the strange fact that the hotel does not serve any alcoholic beverages.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2018,4,An ocean front comfort!!!,"Location: on the ocean front in anfa Casablanca Facility: a nice modern sleek facility with a Moroccan touch. It’s connected to a nice mall. A five story faculty with a nice gym, a swimming pool, a spa, two restaurants with nice terraces. Very delicious breakfast buffet that offers great selection of authentic Moroccan with exceptional service. Check in: quick and smooth. Room: a basic room but nice and clean. It has a spacious marble bathroom. Not too fancy. A very comfortable bed. Conciege: helpful. House keeping: not consistent. Over all: a beautiful hotel with a breathtaking view on the ocean front.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2018,3,Does not live up to expectations,The hotel is very beautiful and has a stunning view onto the sea. The first thing you should know is that this is a non alcohol hotel. We knew this before but maybe some would be bothered. Some staff are really nice and polite as you would expect but others are just plain rude or incredibly slow. The noise level in the room was unacceptable. You can hear a conversation from the other room so get disturbed often. Shame for such a beautiful hotel.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2018,5,good sleep,"Bed softness was extremely fitted to me. This gave me a deepest sleep and relaxation. Also breakfast was excellent. Hopefully, it would be much better if some kinds of salad dressing would be available for vegetable. Thank you.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2018,5,First class service,The service is really good and managed to make us feel home in this hotel. The modern design is very nice and offers all the luxury you can expect from Four seasons. We had a terrific dinner at the restaurant. I will stay here again and recommend it to my friends.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,4,HAVING BREAKFAST WITH A VIEW !,Enormous big and in one of the best locations of Casablanca (we think) . The view of the ocean was magnificent. The personnel very friendly but a bit …slow. The breakfast was excellent and the room’s comfort very satisfactory. The lack of alcohol in most Moroccona hotels isn’t something that we were used to but we were adjusted,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2018,5,Lovely hotel,"It is new, fresh, clean and very nice. Large spacious rooms. Nice staff! The only minus is the non-alcoholic before they get the permit. It is a bit boring not to be able to get a drink. Nice situated a bit away from the city.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2018,5,sleep like a baby tonight,"I only had time to experience my room, because of a late arrival and early departure both days, but it was great. Sufficiently spacious, well equipped, and quiet with a view of the sea. The bed was extremely comfortable, the en suite bathroom nicely laid out and supplied with good quality toiletries, and the coffee machine proved easy to use and turned out a decent cuppa. Any downside ? Well, if you're partial to the occasional alcoholic beverage you'd better go elsewhere as the Four Seasons is, to misuse the rainwear brand, ""drizabone"" which perhaps results in the rather subdued atmosphere in the so called bar area (but which also has a lovely terrace overlooking the large patio that leads down to the beach).",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2018,5,"Luxurious Rooms, Delectable Food, and the Most Amazing Staff!","Our stay at the Four Seasons Casablanca was nothing short of perfection! Our room was so gorgeous - large and pristine with modern decor and a bed that I had to force myself to get out of every morning! We would contemplate going out on the town in the evenings but honestly, both of us just wanted to lounge in our huge, luxurious bed. The housekeeping staff was amazing and we had every amenity we could ever want at our fingertips. The staff of the Four Seasons were some of the friendliest we've ever encountered! We wanted to go to a soccer match in town and Mohamed was so kind and tracked down (hard to find) tickets for us! And he checked on us often and was so professional and courteous. And our favorite staff member, Amine, was so awesome. He always remembered our names and…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Breakfast buffet was superb the view is breath taking and ideal for family and yes it's a costly They have Nespresso machines the best coffee..,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2018,2,Concierge Service is ZERO,"The only thing I can tell you is you are staying in a police station, every time you enter a coffee shop or restaurant they will ask you for your room number 2 or 3 times as if you are criminal. I book a limousine transfer and I get confirmation and when I go down no booking and no limousine. If you don’t check the bill you will be doubled for everything. I think the hotel doesn’t have a GM yet.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,3,Beautiful but chaotic hotel with poor service,This hotel was beautiful but chaotic. Staff seemed overwhelmed and were not very responsive to our needs. Concierge never got back to us about a visit to the Hassan Mosque. We were told we could bring a bottle of wine to the one restaurant that was opened in the hotel on New Year's Eve. Then when we tried to bring in the bottle we were told that was not possible. Our room was beautiful however the lock on our door failed to work and we had to wait quite some time before it was fixed.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,5,luxury hotel,"we booked one night in this fancy hotel and it was great ; friendly staff , very clean room s, we had a room that wich you can you enjoy the ocean , also there are many great restaurants near by 10 mn from the hotel so that you can walk while enjoying the ocean. it was a bit expensive but it worth it.Highly recommended",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

There is nesspresso coffee machine in room. However, bathroom is a bit malfunction. Shower faucet in bathtub is broken. Shower faucet in shower cannot completely close- water drips all night. There is no make up room when we return back on the second night. However, housekeeping knocks our door in first night, offering turn down service while we just 15 minutes checking into room?! Breakfast room is big with variety of food, including pork bacon :). Staff is all around in front of hotel.

 May 2017,4,Where's the Booze?,"The hotel is beautiful, our room was luxurious, the location by the beach on the Atlantic was perfect. However, how can you have a Four Seasons Hotel where you can't get a drop of wine or spirits? Maybe this will change. Their website say they have a pending liquor license. In the meantime, we walked a short distance down the Atlantic coast to an excellent seafood restaurant, because we wanted a decent bottle of wine with our dinner, so avoided the hotel's ding room.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,4,"Good Place, Lousy Area","This hotel is first-class. The staff is friendly and attentive, the service impeccable. The accommodations are everything you would expect from the Four Seasons. The hotel is right on the beach, and a member of my party had a suite that overlooked the ocean. Very nice. There are two major minuses. The first is that the beach oustide the confines of the resort is not kept up. Given that this is a major selling point for the hotel they might want to consider cleaning up the flotsam and jetsam the washes up on the beach. The other thing is that the hotel is not in a great area, I wouldn't leave the resort at night.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2017,5,No minor detail spared!,"What a phenomenal hotel! We had a 24 hour stopover on our way back to New York from Portugal, and decided that my wife (8 months pregnant at the time) could use a little pampering and a good nights sleep before the last flight home.

We're certainly fans of the four seasons franchise now!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,5,Endulge in luxury,Everything was just top. Wonderful beds. Lovely room. Smooth check in. The Wiev. The food. The staff. Just perfect. Everybode was very welcomming and helpful.

 December 2017,1,Not what you expect from Four Seasons,"Very disappointing. We have stayed in other Four Seasons across the US and Asia, and the quality of the rooms and stay was not on par with what you pay. We stayed here for one night when we landed before our onward journey to Marrakech. Pros 1) Courteous staff 2) Gave us early check-in which we appreciated as we hadn’t slept on the 7 hour red-eye. Cons 1) Room - we got the superior room, and it just looked over to gravel, and another building. Think car park. Room was dark. 2) There were window cleaners coming in on our balcony, and our terrace sliding door lock was broken. 3) Concierge Gave us misleading information about how we could get 1st class train tickets to Marrakech just before train leaves. I was very skeptical, but she insisted that we had nothing to worry…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Before my booking I emailed Mr.Haider many times and always he answered me really good, also during my stay I met him and he provided every thing in the best way. Undoubtedly, not only in Morocco and even not only in Four Seasons, he is one the best reservation and concierge experts in the world.

 November 2017,5,Not what you expect,Arrived at 5 pm. Check in was slow n then was invited for a drink at the bar. Figured something was amiss and asked instead to go the the room. Then was informed that actually room was not ready. I refused to accept this attempt to misguide us upon which the check in person disappeared to return later and inform we had been upgraded to a partial sea view room. The room was on the third/fourth floor overlooking a public lot next door such that you could not open the curtains for want of privacy. Friends staying in their regular rooms facing the inner courtyard or pool were better off. Did not enjoy the stay at all.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2017,3,Extremely Average for a 4 Seasons,"We stayed at the 4 seasons on the tail end of our honeymoon thinking that it would be a nice way to end the trip. We weren't expecting that this hotel would actually be the least favorite of our entire time in Morocco. The area wasn't really anything to write home about, and the high security just seem too much. The pools were nice, and the room was decent but I was somewhat annoyed that there was no alcohol on the property. A view of the ocean with mediocre food and mocktails just isn't as satisfying as having a proper drink.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2017,5,First business trip to morocco,"Amazing hotel with great view on the Atlantic Ocean, restaurant has some brilliant food, but no alcohol licence which is the only downside for me. The bed is probably the best hotel bed I have ever slept in and just that can justify the price! Will highly recommend it to anyone visiting Casablanca",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,3,Extremely Average Hotel,"We booked the Four Seasons Hotel in Casablanca based on several wonderful past experiences in other Four Seasons properties. This relatively new hotel is the lowest end part of the Four Seasons brand that we have ever experienced. Our room was plain, small and quite uninteresting. It looked remarkably similar to any average business hotel room in the U.S. The hotel itself is also uninteresting except for being located on the beach next to the ocean. It does have a lovely restaurant outdoor terrace which overlooks the beach and the ocean. However, half the guests on the terrace were smoking since it is permitted in this part of the restaurant. Accordingly, we moved inside to a no smoking area. We ate at both restaurants and the food was quite good. As mentioned in other reviews,…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2017,5,Perfect weekend getaway,"I planned an impromptu weekend getaway here for my significant other's birthday since Royal Air Maroc now offers a non-stop flight between Washington, DC and Casablanca...and I couldn't have asked for a more memorable experience. From inception, I requested the house car (i.e. Audi) to transport us from the airport to hotel via the Four Seasons app - highly recommend using this transportation versus a taxi. Even though we arrived in the morning, the hotel graciously permitted us an early check-in which gave us time for a quick nap before adventuring out to explore the old Medina. The hotel staff were unbelievably accommodating and knowledgeable - one of the many reasons I adore the Four Seasons. From our check in to our check out, they ensured a thoroughly enjoyable visit.…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Good Spa and gym, and very nice walk by the seaside, if you like to make some exercise.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,4,Great but No Alcohol,"Stayed here in Oct for a couple nights. Good location with a nice view of the ocean, although to be honest, it's not a beach where I want lay out in the sun or swim. Service overall was very good, very accommodating. Breakfast pretty decent. The rooms are nice and updated, and most important, the bed was very comfortable. The Four Seasons Casablanca lived up to its brand reputation. Four stars because at the time of our travel, the hotel didn't serve alcohol, which is such a bummer, given that travelers would definitely look forward to enjoying a nice alcoholic beverage in this beautiful property overlooking the ocean. It's definitely a party-pooper. The hotel has been open for over a year now, and it still hasn't received its alcohol license. Would definitely come back…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,4,Conference,I stayed in this hotel for few nights. The rooms are large and well equipped- very attentive house keeping- the maid made my room meticulously- loved it. Breakfast good but nothing spectacular. Beach next to the hotel but dirty. Shame Worst thing is absolute lack of alcohol. Nice outdoor restaurant and one cannot have a glass of wine Gym is small and without a window so looks more like Holiday Inn Overall solid 4 stars but below standard 5 starts expected from Four Seasons,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2017,5,An oasis in Casablanca,My stay at the Four Seasons has been so lovely. Many of the hotel rooms offer views of the ocean. One is lulled to sleep at night by the sounds of the sea..so restful. The city awaits at the hotel entrance offering all the wonderful restaurants and clubs of the Ain Diab area of Casablanca city. I appreciated the willingness of the staff to accomodate my needs.Breakfast or tea on the terrace is a must. Room service is exceptional. I will stay here again before I leave my dream Morocco vacation .Highly recommended.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,5,Excellent service & serenity,"The Four Seasons Hotel Casablanca was outstanding from the moment we arrived. From the top-notch service and warm, accommodating staff to the immaculate design and amazingly comfortable beds, everything was exceptional. Yes, as many people have mentioned, they don't serve alcohol, but they do have a selection of traditional teas that is simply sublime. And how can you complain about anything while enjoying a delicious breakfast overlooking the beach?",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2017,4,Pluses and minuses,"Total pluses: Extremely friendly staff: Very good breakfast. Croissants are better than in Paris what is rare in Southern hotels: Good TV system and reasonably fast internet. Pluses/Minuses: Nicely and tastefully decorated rooms. Electricity sockets are everywhere needed ,what is rare in many good hotels. But there are nonsenses in design: say, terraces doors handle is placed behind the table and under hardly movable curtain! No bide and towels dryer ""snake"" in very large bathroom. Hotel is located at the ocean in very quiet area where just roaring ocean can be heard but is music ,not noise...Balconies or terraces are in each room ,nothing similar in other 5* hotels in the city.

 November 2017,1,Poor service,"We spent over an hour before they could find out reservation. This is despite giving them our prepaid voucher with all reservation details. For a for season no attention to detail. Only one restaurant open at 7 pm. No alcohol served in the only open restaurant. The rooms were good, well equipped and comfortable. Bottom line. Not worth the money.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,3,Nice Hotel but no liquor license,"Very nice hotel with excellent service and accommodations.

 October 2017,3,WHAT?- NO WINE?,To cut to the chase- while the hotel is beautiful - there is NO alcohol served in this hotel-something the travel agent we used suitably neglected to tell us as she highly reco'd and booked us into this hotel- So shouting it out here - if you want to relax and have a glass of wine after a long journey.. go elsewhere.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2017,5,That bed though!,"I will never forget this bed! Unbelievable sleep here on my last night in Morocco. Hotel is gorgeous with some great views of the ocean. Spent most of the evening sitting out on their patio at one of the restaurants enjoying the music and views. Short car ride to the Hassan II Mosque. Although the hotel is right on the ocean, unfortunately the beach is not very well kept in Casablanca (lots of garbage in the water but plans are in the works to develop the area) so did not spend anytime there. A bit far from the airport but overall a great stopover hotel if arriving/departing from Casablanca.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,5,Top service at the 4 Seasons,"In Casablanca, we stayed at the 4 Seasons hotel, which is first-rate. The facilities and the service were impressive. It is superbly located right on the beach next to a shopping mall and near the main beach promenade. At short notice, the hotel arranged a car with Aziz as the driver and a guide for a whole day tour of Casablanca. The guide, Naeema, was outstanding – her depth of knowledge of the city, its history and its characteristics gave us a really detailed understanding of the city, starting with the mosque and then ending at Rick’s café. Unfortunately, Rick’s Café turned out to be closed when we got there in the afternoon, but we appreciated seeing it from the outside anyway. Naeema was careful in pointing out that the Rick’s Café in Casablanca is a simulation and was…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2017,5,THE Hotel in Casablanca,"This was the perfect hotel for our first day and night in Morocco after flying in from the US. 3 flights and 3 continents in one travel and we were ready for some luxury relaxation. Found it at the Casablanca Four Seasons. Absolutely fantastic experience. Quiet, refined luxury. Perfect service, in fact, the service was so perfect we were hardly aware of it, the staff is that good. We took advantage of the afternoon tea and breakfast buffet - both were amazing and a must. I loved the pool and the quick, secure, beach access. If you need a Starbucks fix there is one in the mall next door - an easy 5 minutes away but the coffee in the room and at breakfast were both excellent. I will definitely return to this hotel next time I'm in Casablanca.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,5,Excellent modern hotel with very good service and great location,"Modern, well designed, recently constructed, luxury hotel on the water in Casablanca. Our room was spacious, thoughtfully designed and functional, very clean, with excellent amenities. Hotel has a pleasant pool area with limited chaise loungers and secure entry to wide public beach. Service was very good. Restaurant was good, but note that alcohol is not available",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,5,Beautiful Hotel and fantastic service!,"As usual Four Seasons is always wonderful. The property was gorgeous, right on the water and the staff was very friendly. We stayed here for one night before we flew out of Morocco. It had all of the luxuries and the bed was extremely comfortable. It's a very short walk from a shopping centre and plenty of restaurants.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,5,A Beautiful Oasis in Casablanca,"My husband and I stayed here for the first leg of our honeymoon through Morocco. The hotel is absolutely wonderful - right on the beach with large extremely comfortable rooms and a bed that makes you never want to leave. The thing that makes this hotel exceptional, however, is the staff. Every single staff member was amazingly attentive and helpful and went above and beyond to make our stay as perfect as possible. Both restaurants are excellent, and the ocean view with the lush garden courtyard truly makes the hotel feel like an oasis in the middle of a loud and dusty city. We spent 2 days site seeing in Casablanca, and it was such a pleasure to come home to the Four Seasons every evening and have a mocktail while watching the tide roll in. While at the hotel we had a…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,5,Western Style Luxury,"We needed a room in Casablanca for one night before we flew out of the country the next day. After riads and Moroccan style guest houses, we opted for something more Western. Location on the beach is great rooms are large and modern with lots of amenities. Security is very good, sleep quality is excellent, and a modern functional bathroom with a western style shower that actually worked was a pleasure. This is just what you would expect from a Four Seasons with one BIG exception. As of October 2017 they had not yet received their liqueur liscense. No bar and no drinks with dinner and no place nearby to go for a drink. A great hotel but if there not being alcohol available is an issue for you, then stay somewhere else.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2017,4,Elegant hotel. Attentive staff. Great Potential,"Casablanca was the first stop for our honeymoon trip and we spent the first night at Four Seasons. Its a beautiful hotel and I felt exclusive going through double tier security check coming into the hotel (previous impression was that Morocco is not a very safe place, so this was good). The hotel knew it was our honeymoon, and they upgraded our room and left a personalised welcome message and a dessert plate in the room. The check-in staff, concierge and later the reception crew who checked us out of the hotel, all knew we were honeymooners so that's a big plus for being attentive. Well done. Breakfast buffet had lots of selection to go for. And, I see many business executives do breakfast meetings here. Dinner was a little disappointing when we discovered that alcohol…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2017,5,Good spot to escape,Stayed two nights here to break the tour of Morocco and found it safe clean and great food at the lounge!

We didn’t do the Restaurant but the buffet breakfast is good but request gluten free as they do it special as it is not on the buffet,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,5,Four seasons,"The four seasons was an amazing experience. We arrived at night and the security was great, we certainly felt safe. The rooms were comfortable with an amazing bathroom area. The staff were helpful with all needs, from directions, and also food services. The views were simply spectacular!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,3,Not up to 4 Seasons Standards,"This is a very nice hotel, but.....as a four seasons, it is lacking. It is on a very small property. There is beach access, but it is public and quite littered. There is an empty lot on the one side of the property with cars parked. The pool area is very small. The view from the seafood restaurant is really nice. Service is fine, rooms are beautiful, but overall the hotel doesn’t do much for me. I guess as a business hotel, it is fine being next to the convention centre but not a hotel I would go back to from a vacation property to stay at. I think they could have done better. There was a very eclectic mix of people at the lobby restaurant. There is no liquor license and no sense of when/if they will get one. So nothing wrong with this place, but not a…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,1,Worst Four Seasons,"horrible service- Ordered food to my room. They said the waiting time is 40 mins which is ok. I called them after 1h to ask where my food is they told me they've forgot it. The next day same thing happened but this time, they told me they are so busy they have no idea where to start. Arrogant stuff- I asked for salt and pepper asap as my dish was getting cold, I was told to get it my self if I want them quickly extremely slow service- takes the stuff 10-15 mins to bring a glass/fork. They do not serve alcohol Poor room cleaning- I found broken glass on the floor and cut my feet with it although I didn't break anything during my stay.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We hâve liked the menus that the hotel was offering. Room services was good.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,5,Certainly the Best Hotel in Casablanca,"I have previously been to other 5-star hotels in Casa. They were all good but nothing like the Four Seasons. It is a brand new hotel so obviously everything is still Nice and New. But this is not all. the place is genuinely ""beautiful"". The interior designers have done an excellent job, keeping things modern but with a Moroccan local touch... except for the musharrabia-like additions on the outside which I would knock down as they limit the beautiful view of the Ocean. Service, check-in. check-out, sleep quality, room amenities, all excellent. i can go on, and on, concierge, valet parking, pool etc... A minor remark if I may, the entrance of the hotel is kind of hidden. I would move the Four Seasons sign out towards the street. We also got an upgrade which is always welcome.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,5,An Amazing Experience!,"This is my first stay at this particular hotel and I must say it has exceeded my expectations.

Will be back - for sure!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,1,This hotel was a big mistake,It took me an hour and half to check in bc i put the wrong date on my reservation. The manger ask me to pay for another reservation and she will upgrade me to premium. When i got to my room after two hours from the check in the room wasn't premium and there was no view and the funny thing it was two bed. Well i used the other bed to put my stuff on it. Anyway that was a big mistake,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 September 2017,4,"Good hotel, without alcohol license and charging ""Delivery Charge"" for in-room dining","Good hotel by Casablanca standards, friendly and well-trained staff, elegant rooms, prompt housekeeping. The hotel still does not have its alcohol license, despite having been open for a number of years now. This is quite annoying if you plan on a meeting with a round of drinks, or are keen on your glass of wine with your dinner. The hotel has this year introduced a EUR 5 ""delivery charge"" for its in-room dining...

 September 2017,5,Excellent Hotel!,"If you are looking for a nice hotel in Casablanca without having to worry about the food/water not settling and are looking for amenities, Four Seasons is the one. We flew into Casablanca from Chicago and this hotel was perfect. It is about 30 minutes from the airport with no traffic and right on the ocean. The beach is a public beach but the pool and grounds are amazing with great views of the water. One thing to note: This hotel DOES NOT HAVE ALCOHOL. If you want it, I would suggest getting some at duty free and bringing it or there is also a close supermarket and you can get some there to drink. Otherwise, the staff was attentive and spoke English as well as was friendly and accommodating.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2017,5,Best hotel in Casablanca,We've been going to this hotel ever since it opened 2 years ago and we really love it! The location is the best in Casablanca with a mall right next to it.

 September 2017,5,Unforgettable Stay,"Unfortunately we stayed only one night only which was the last night before we flew back home but it turned out to be amazing. Literally everything was so good; location, staff, rooms, spa, swimming pool and food for sure. The best and most varied breakfast buffet we had in Morocco with the best view.

 August 2017,4,"Gorgeous Rooms, No Alcohol","Our family really enjoyed our stay at the Four Seasons Casablanca, the rooms were huge, beds very comfortable, and pool a perfect place to relax; our only issue was that the hotel did not have a liquor license.

 July 2017,3,"Great Breakfast, Sad Beach, Inconsistent Service","This Four Seasons was formerly another hotel, and it's attempts at covering up the old bits and re-training (or bringing jn new) staff still have a way to go. The suites are well appointed, the breakfast buffet offers an amazing array of treats, and the decor in the main areas is very beautiful. However, the beach they are situated on is public and so that opens up visitors to Casablancan lifestyle--ie, people washing themselves and their clothes in the ocean, large groups of men training and exercising, and we even witnessed a protest march along the beach (orginating from what I would deem as the world's largest McDonalds, which is directly next to the property!!).

We were able to arrange a private tour at the concierge desk at last minute. The hotel is amazing as is to be expected from a Four Seasons - rooms are large, modern, amenities are plentiful and those beds are just wonderful to sleep in. The restaurant & staff are lovely. No negatives other than fact you cannot get alcohol here. Not in restaurant where food would go so well with a nice wine. Also not in lobby bar where they make excellent mocktails. Hopefully they can fix this.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We felt welcome and any request was met with complete satisfaction. Kudos especially to Claire of the Concierge. Dinner reservations, transportation and tours were scheduled and executed perfectly. The room was beautifully appointed and the Housekeeping staff kept that way during our stay. The couples treatment at the Spa was one of the best experiences ever.

We got back around 6 and decided to get ready to go out to dinner and reported the issue to the front desk so maintenance could repair it while we we were out. We returned at 10:30 and it was still very hot. We called and asked the front desk for an update and they said it was fine, but would send maintenance again to take a look. Needless to say, this issue (after 2 visits from maintenance) was not resolved until we moved rooms 9in our pj's) and finally were able to go to bed at 1:00 am.

First of all there is a small pool. The beach is crowded with locals and the beach is not a beach you would think of. It's more of a dirty place for recreation. There are no beach chairs and it's not apart of the hotel. Location is a good area next to the mall. Other than that their service was lacking. It's apparently the best hotel in Casablanca so i would stay here if I had to come back, but it's not a four seasons like the others.

So manager promised that they will resolve the issue first thing in the AM. The next day by 2pm they still had done nothing until we reached out to them. Our keys were still not working.

The staff from arrival to departure received a 10 for services. I have no complaints or recommendations that could improve the service is it was outstanding. The rooms are 5 stars. Large and Clean. The bed i slept in is the best bed i have ever slept in and i travel away for approximately 250 nights per year. Housekeeping could not do a better job. i used the hotel limousine service to get around casablanca which i recommend if planning on getting about. the drivers are all professional and all of the cars offer wifi. wifi can be a hit or miss but i had 4g so no props on that front. the hotel is also close to attractions. i walked to the Hassan II mosque, medina and the…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 June 2017,3,Casablanca Four Seasons,"We attended this hotel during Ramadan. The staff and amenities are great. We did though run into issues with Room Service which was late an hour and a half. The food though was ok. The spa is great, and restaurant in the lobby is good.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2017,4,Good but not great,"Very nice facility as you'd expect from a Four Season. Despite being immediately facing the ocean, the building layout is a bit odd, which leads to many rooms lacking privacy and/or a view. The rooms are elegant (except for a rather tacky arabesque painting hanging on the wall), spacious and comfortable. The staff is pleasant and helpful. The quality of the food is at times underwhelming. For an unknown reason, the hotel still does not have its liquor license, despite being open for well over a year. The hotel does alert the customer to this odd reality at the time of booking. But as a returning customer, it just feels incomprehensible how a hotel like that in Casablanca still cannot manage to obtain a liquor license?!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,5,Incredible Hotel Experience,"From the moment we were escorted to our suite for check in, this was an exceptional stay. The staff took care of everything we needed and then some! Our room was impeccable, with a balcony overlooking the ocean, an incredibly luxurious bed, and a gorgeous bathroom. We ate at Bleu overlooking the sunset for Iftar, which offered a full buffet of incredible dishes, both local and global. The staff was able to provide us all sorts of accessories when our bags were delayed, and care service to and from the airport was swift and luxe. 100% would stay here again when in Casablanca again!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,5,Best Hotel in Casablanca!,"Absolutely the best choice in Casablanca, in every way, the location, the staff, comfort and amenities. The only suggestion would be to add some vegan/vegetarian options for dinner. Other than that it was perfect. The breakfast was above and beyond!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,5,Suite Perfection!,"Upon entering the suite, I was immediately taken in by the layout and interior. It's not the usual FS luxury, but it works very well. The entry hallway featured a washroom and multiple closets....the first of three sets throughout the suite. Weird that this suite was not at the end of the hallway by the bigger suites, offering a better beach/ocean view. Nice bedroom with ample space, changing area which leads to an oversized bathroom, shower and toilet room. Comfy bed of course, slept very well. If you need a suite of this size, then go ahead, otherwise an oversized regular room does the job. Check-In/Check-Out was fine....lovely staff always. I had an amazing driver for the day. The Four Seasons is fairly new and as the manager explained to me, this level of luxury and…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2017,5,Casablanca Heaven,We stayed here for one night but it was very nice. Everyone was attentive and wanted to help with all of our needs. Want to go back for more. Their pool area is very clean with water that is heated. They also have a hot tub so it is nice to get in. The bar area is very nice. This hotel does not have alcohol license so you cannot drink in the hotel. Take your own bottles with you. They are near a mosque and they have been fighting to get the license for 1.5 years. Not sure when they will get their permit. Overall the view is awesome and great place to stay,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,5,Could not ask for a better hotel,All in all our stay was perfect. Spacious room with everything one could possibly ask for. Bargain price for Four Seasons - would easily be willing to pay double for the quality and standards of this hotel. The hotel is on the beach and one can enjoy peaceful morning walks exploring the tidal pools. Restaurants in walking distance if you prefer to eat off site. 5 Stars....,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,5,A great stay,Enjoyed a wonderful stay in a beautiful and comfortable setting. Wonderful food and amazing breakfast with great view.

 May 2017,4,"Nice, but not excellent","I guess we had become used to gorgeous boutique hotels with personalized service, because this hotel seemed cookie-cutter and impersonal to us. Everything was in order and well designed and done, but it lacked the magic of so many of our recent stays. The gym was excellent though! Note that they don't have a liquor license yet. Also note that because the building is long and thin, very few (6) rooms have true water views. We were upgraded to a partial water view, which could be seen from the balcony.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,5,Wonderful Moroccan experience,"I spent three nights at this hotel for a conference in Casablanca in May 2017. The hotel is stylish, comfortable and luxurious.

 May 2017,1,terrible stay in Four seasons Casablanca,"Hi team, I have encoutred several issues during my stay. First the Door was locked until midnight I couldn't enter my room until midnight, the door was not working and they had to enforce the balcony to be able to enter in the room. I came from work 5 pm and since then I couldn't enter to get a shower until midnight. The next day I had to call the reception because of serious water leak in the corridor coming from the anti fire column, all the corridor was full of water and I had to call the reception to avoid any further leak that could spread into the rooms. The days after were only nightmare they were trying to fix that water leak and repair the carpet by a big fan very very noisy. Even the water on the carpet was stinking. In conclusion very bad stay",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2017,4,Nice but breakfast at the restaurant needs a change in management,"One of the best hotels in terms of accommodation. The lounge is great with a cosy fire place on the terrace.

 May 2017,4,I couldn't give it a 5,"Maybe we just had a poor experience here and with the check in staff but it is not at all what I would expect from a Four Seasons. We waited 3 hours for our room to be ready with no offer of anything until about hour 2 1/2 when one of the check in people (not the woman who was checking us in who was worthless and should be immediately fired) offered us water. I repeatedly was told wait 30 more minutes, oh just 15 more, etc. Finally, the amazing and wonderful Mehdi Haider took over and got us into our room (the check in woman also was looking into something and NEVER in 3 hours or at all got back to me but Mehdi did)!

 August 2016,5,Brilliant,"Have been meaning to review for a while... Stayed last summer and it was an amazing hotel. Staff by the pool were attentive, friendly and always happy to help. The pool was relaxing and delightful to lie around. Beach is right out of the doors by the pool. The room was gorgeous, couldn't complain about anything, best bathroom I've had on a holiday. Food was nice, breakfast was a little pricey but everything else was reasonable and afternoon tea is a must! Shopping centre next door was useful and gave a few cheap and fast food options if you are ever in the mood for that... Not a great deal to do in Casablanca but taxis are cheap and if you just want a relaxing holiday by the pool in a luxury hotel it's perfect!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 May 2017,5,Great Location & Staff. Complimentary Spa facilities a bonus.,"This Four Seasons is located overlooking the Atlantic and a public beach. Within walking distance along the Boulevard de la Corniche are a host of waterside restaurants - rather welcome if you like wine with your meal. The hotel does not have a liquor licence and may not be getting one anytime soon, since it has been open over a year without one. (We walked to Le Pilotis and had great fresh caught turbot with a bottle of delicious Moroccan white wine from the Meknes region.) Aside from the lack of booze, the hotel is a delight.

The room was extremely well appointed and spacious with a double balcony overlooking the lush courtyard.

 April 2017,5,Beautiful hotel in Casablanca,"We spent two nights in Casablanca and our friends from there recommended the Four Seasons hotel. The hotel faces the beach and is about 45 minute drive (depending on traffic perhaps more) from the airport. As with other hotels in Morocco, there is a security check before entering into the hotel (and cars are also checked as they come in). The hotel is quite new and beautifully built. We had to wait a little bit for the check-in, but I guess service in Morocco can be a little bit slow. Our room was on the top floor (which is the 5th floor) which is also where the lobby and restaurants are located. The room was spacious, with a nice balcony, a very big comfortable bed and nice bathroom. There is also a gym and a spa in the hotel - the gym was brand new with all the amenities and…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,5,The Hotel in Casablanca,"If looking for the top city hotel in Casablanca, the Four Seasons is your hotel. The hotel is quite new, bringing all the niceties that comes with a young property! The facilities are exceptonal and the service is on par with what you expect from a Four Seasons. If there is an issue - it will be quickly and efficiently managed. If there was one problem, it was that our stay was too short, only one night. But, was able to check out the spa facilities, and definitely worth the time! Don't go to the hotel and fail to spa!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,4,Beautiful hotel shame about the beach,We stayed at the four seasons recently and the hotel was Beautiful! Rooms were large and the reception and service was brilliant. Although it is one of only a few hotels on the beach it probably is the only 5 star hotel beachside. The location is great as it's not too far from the mosque and there are lots of places to eat near by. The only negative is that there is only one pool which isn't really suited to very young children but is brilliant for confident swimmers. Also I should mention that the beach isn't the nicest or cleanest beach around as there was litter everywhere but the kids still enjoyed the beach and water! Overall this probably is one of the best hotels in Casablanca and if I was visiting the region again I would probably stay here again,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 April 2017,3,"Great for Casablanca, but not up to FS Standards","I need to start by saying I love the Four Seasons. I've not only loved being a guests in many FS properties, but I've also hosted events in their hotels. However, FS Casablanca is a slightly different experience. If you've stayed at FS Marrakech, this is night and day and it's almost unfair to make a comparison. As many reviewers have said, Casa is the business centre of Morocco and this hotel is very much designed for that. It's all business and comes across as very stiff and somewhat cold. It is very beautiful, as all FS's are, but there's nothing to distinguish it as uniquely Moroccan -I could have been in any random American city. The bigger issue was staff. The concierge tried to discourage me from visiting the Hassan II Mosque at sunset, and had I listened to them…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The spa is probably the best one in Casablanca if not Morocco. Highly recommended for anyone coming and staying in Casablanca.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,3,Comfortable Bed was the Highlight. Service needs improvement.,"I was very much looking forward to this hotel as it was our last night in Morocco. I had many of the same disappointments as other review writers. We were also surprised that the hotel did not offer alcohol and equally surprised that we were not notified of this before booking. Their website states 'rooftop dining and drinks' which is very misleading. We also had problems at checkout. First of all, we asked for our bags be collected at the room as we had many pieces of heavy luggage. After waiting 10 minutes in the lobby and not receiving our bags, I went back to our room and found the bags sitting in the hallway unattended. Very shocking at such a high calibre hotel. Lastly, we also had issues getting a taxi to the airport. We arranged for two taxis the night before, but the…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 April 2017,5,Thankyou Four Seasons Casablanca,"We love Four Seasons hotels. But the first night of our tour starting in Casablanca,we had a few issues that we explained on check out to the night manager who was extremely kind, gracious and understanding. In truth we left a little disappointed but in true Four Seasons style as we were spending our last night there after touring for 12 days they could not have been more welcoming on our return. They went beyond our expectations and we are very appreciative of how they tried to make our last night special. It is a beautiful hotel facing the Atlantic and furnished to a high level as all Four Season properties are. In fact stunning. The staff are just kind and welcoming. As sadly we were quickly in and out on both occasions we never truly got to savor all the hotel can…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 April 2017,4,Spa Session ( Oriental Deep Massage ),Decided to treat ourselves our last day in Casablanca to this massage. Me and my 3 gfs. We each got a different treatment. I had the deep oriental massage. The sauna and pre- massage room were to die for - you can spend half a lifetime here relaxing. The massage was ok - nothing special but to be honest I find you pay for everything before and after as well. In this case everything before and after was very four seasons - I expected nothing less.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 April 2017,1,"Beautiful exterior, but the interior needs help!","This hotel holds so much potential, but falls very short. Our hotel room's thermostat did not initially work and it took hours to get it fixed. Our room was filled with cigarette smoke despite being in the nonsmoking section of the hotel, the restaurant had about half of the menu offerings available but let us go through the entire menu before ever telling us about it. The food that we had at the pool was inedible but cost about $60 for a lunch for two people. We asked for our bags to be stored, the person never came then 2 hours later they wheeled them outside instead of storing them. We had requested a taxi come to get us for the airport to make our flight, and when we went out to get in it was not there and nobody had ever called for it.

The hotel, as most Four Seasons are, was perfect.. Only negative is that everytime I requested a taxi, I had to wait 5-10minutes... Location is convenient as there is a large shopping mall adjacent to the hotel. The proximity to the beach is also nice, even though it is not a beautiful beach.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 February 2017,4,Clean & modern 😄,"Visited this hotel in February 2017 for our annual family trip. During our first 2 nights in this city, my family have a shock 😰. Reason being that we stayed in the United nation square in a tired looking US hotel brand and with a view of those old buildings that looked like they have been bombed. Thus, that image haunted us in our trip to Marrakech. On our return trip to Casablanca, we were very surprised to see the palm trees lining up the road leading to this hotel. The area is totally...I mean 10x, different from the horrid united nation square. FS Casablanca is very clean, modern and a spacious hotel. As I have mentioned in my review of FS Lion Palace St Petersburg, I am a great fan of FS beds and thus, I have a good sleep here.

 March 2017,5,Sublimely luxurious and comfortable,"Beautifully designed and luxurious high end hotel. I love the architecture - you enter the hotel on the top floor and then go down for rooms and the garden terrace with pool. The interior of the reception level has some beautiful design details that take Moroccan traditional influences and mix them with contemporary design. The hotel is very comfortable with really excellent service. There are so many staff! And they all greet you, even the chambermaids you meet in the hallways. The rooms are spotlessly clean and very well equipped. My bed was enormous and soooo comfortable. I don't know what luxury hotels specify for their mattresses and pillows, but you just know it's amazing quality. I could have stayed for days!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Four Season is known for its service and this property is no exception. Each and every staff try to make you comfortable and really feel pride in what they do right from front desk, lobby staff, room service etc. They take care of even small things that one dont see at any other hotel. Buffet breakfast is one of the best I found. It is ocean from restaurant, great ocean view. However being a new property, there are some issues. We had problem with shower but was resolved.

 March 2017,5,Elegant hotel with excellent guest service,"The Four Seasons brand is elegant by design, specializing in exceptional guest service. The Casablanca Four Seasons is no exception -- we were delighted with the care we received from every staff member we encountered. Of course, there's always the chance of human error -- the conceirge forgot to order our early wake-up call and taxi (oops), but the manager was super helpful and made up for their error, ensuring we arrived at the airport on time. A shout out to Muhamed at their Mint Restaurant, whose delightful rapport with guests was a stand-out for us. If you're in Casablanca, this is a wonderful property in which to stay.

 March 2017,4,Falls just short of excellent,"Stayed at the four seasons on the last night of our 9 day Morocco tour. The rooms are large, clean and very well decorated, but the ocean view is obscured from most rooms and you need to be standing in the balcony to really see the ocean. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel and both were of a very high standard. The small size of the hotel and arrangement of the rooms with the obscured ocean view makes it fall short of a classic four seasons hotel.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 February 2017,4,Luxurious Hotel with beautiful view of ocean,"This was definitely a high end hotel with first class amenities. It was clean, space and the staff (reception, restaurants, etc) were all very friendly and helpful. The reason I did not give this a rating of 5 was the fact that alcohol is not served in this hotel. I am not too much into alcohol but I wanted to try a beer or wine from Morocco. It is completely legal but I was told the licenses is pending. After some review and some checking I found out the issue is proximity of hotel to neiboring mosque. Apparently, other establishments including a club nearby offer such service.

The restaurant is spacious, confortable, good food. The whole concept is elegant. Really liked it. The Spa had the most sophisticated menu, I asked for an Asian, deep tissue massage. I got a good full body, not, bad, but was expecting a more therapeutic deep tissue asian style. The issue with the liquor license its a drawback, I really would have preferred to have a nice glass of wine, with my delicious dinner at their beautiful restaurant, but since it is my first visit to Casablanca, I don't know if there is another hotel of this category in this city..that has a wine list.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 January 2017,5,Much improved,After my initial poor review of this hotel I am happy to report that the four seasons hotel in Casablanca has improved considerably in service and overall performance. It's now worthy of four seasons and offers a truly 5 star experience. It's a shame they still don't have a liquor license but as this was at least mentioned on their website a quick stop at the airport tax free store solved the liquor issue. Well done four seasons it was a pleasure to stay here.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2016,4,Gorgeous but unusual,"Having never been to Africa in my life, I expected an exhilarating trip and experience. After all isn't this rapper French Montana home? Hotel is stunning. Intricate detail on artwork, security before you enter hotel. To the 9s. What turned me off was that they didn't serve alcohol and they don't really keep all their restaurants opened. I mean I get it. They told us they were fresh from grand opening and awaiting liquor license but that's a big no-no for me. I wish my travel agent told us before we booked. We even tried to buy our own bottle of wine and didn't have a corkscrew. We asked if they could open and denied us. Another let down.

Pool was heated, service was excellent everywhere, Everything in the room worked, and the bed was gorgeous. Gym was excellent with very modern equipment and offered lots of towels, water, healthy snacks and even a fridge with cold towels. Certainly my kind of gym! Room service was efficient, Breakfast got the thumbs up from my boys and the beach out side the gate was fun to play on and even tried out some body surfing, My boys aged 12 and 14 loved it all and of course the Jacuzzi attached to the pool.

Our travel agency had arranged another hotel in Casablanca but we decided to change the reservation and select the Four Season because we wanted a modern and luxury hotel offering all five star amenities. This was a welcomed change after staying in several Riads across the country. The reception staff was welcoming and very helpful. Jamal went out of his way to help us check in and show us the rooms personally as we arrived late in the evening.

Big mistake as to my husbands horror there is no alcohol! It is a beautiful hotel with a lovely position, with fabulous staff but we chose to eat out for lunch and dinner which is a shame. A must when in Casablanca is a trip to Ricks Cafe which was the highlight of our trip. Don't bother to pay extra for a sea view (which we had!) unless money is no object at you can afford the penthouse as the sea view was very disappointing (you could see it if you hung over the balcony and looked to the side!)",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,4,Amazing staff and accommodation - breathtaking,"Same issue as I had with the Bellagio in Vegas. They take a £700 deposit, which sits on pending for two weeks...even if you pay the outstanding balance with another card. For the record, my better half paid for the accommodation, but her card wasn't working at the time. Two weeks later, emails to my bank and The Hotel, I find out tomorrow.

 December 2016,3,Not up to Four Seasons standards,"We had hoped for an upscale break from the typical Riads of Morocco... but in our view this property fell short of the usual Four Seasons standard. While the staff were warm and welcoming, it was difficult to overcome the subpar room service cuisine (overcooked, limp food brought in late on a dirty, food encrusted tablecloth) and exorbitantly priced breakfast buffet for Morocco (USD$32 per person). The locale on the beach is quite lovely and of course the room and bedding were heavenly as usual. We cannot fault the hotel for not having a liquor license (they've submitted an application but haven't been approved yet), but this was an inconvenience during our stay.

Very friendly and kind staff, the concierge team is very helpful and assists will all good tipps for the city. The rooms are large and very nice.

 November 2016,3,Desapointed,"I love Four Seasons ! This hotel doesn't have the standard and the spirit that I am happy to find in all their other properties . The lobby is inexistant , the reception staff doesn't escort the clients to their room and just indicate the way to the elevators ... the rooms are large but most of the Four Seasons touches are missing ! As an example The Nespresso machine has no water and no mineral bottle around to fill it ... the cups have wood sticks instead of spoons ( even tagged four seasons it s cheap ) One of the bed light was dead .. And furthermore the hotel has no alcool license ... so it s impossible to handle any business dinner or drinks on site . The view is beautiful .... four Seasons is a great chain I am sure they will make it but there I still a gap !!!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We picked the Four Seasons Casablanca for our last night because we had been so disappointed in our stay at the Sofitel Casablanca the week before. We definitely made the right choice in switching to the Four Seasons! Our room was spacious an comfortable; they even upgraded us upon arrival to a Junior Suite. We had both lunch and dinner in the restaurant and were very happy with the quality of food and level of service - both were superb.

The hotel screens all luggage, but the screener at the entrance cannot take suitcases, so they have to be sent to different location. Expect 1+ hour to see your suitcase again based on my experience. Totally unacceptable. Maybe if you come -on one week charter holiday this can be forgiven. The complimentary internet must be a savings option indeed. It is so slow that it had difficulties synchronising my mail.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2016,5,"Beautiful hotel, no alcohol","I wonder it the developer thought this out beforehand. The hotel is beautiful and chic, like most Four Seasons. And it would be lovely venue for happy hour, except for the fact that the hotel lacks a liquor permit. But for just one night stay (admitedly too short), it wasn´t much of a problem. Decent restaurant (a bit too quiet and empty for a Friday night). Very nice rooms, with views of the lovely couryard.

 November 2016,3,Be aware,"It's one year old hotel. So it has some advantages and disadvantages. The most advantage is his luxury interiors. Good views have only front ocean rooms. Our room had wasteland view. Currently hotel doesn't have alcohol license so it's 100% nonalcoholic area despite the restaurant ""Blue"" decorated wine bottles. Actually service and dishes at this restaurant also very far from Four Seasons's level. The breakfast in another restaurant of this hotel was perfect.

There was even a courtesy call later in the evening to make sure we didn't need anything further. I expect great service from a place like the Four Seasons.

That's ok but I think it's a little misleading not to mention it prominently before you reserve - on the website homepage. The location is a bit out of the center of town but a nice neighborhood - the hotel is on top of a shopping mall which depending on your point of view is either a plus or a minus. That said, the restaurant Bleu is absolutely delicious, service is first rate and our premier ocean view room is appointed beautifully.

Food is fine, but had better in Fez and Marrakech. Service in restaurant was mediocre. They don't serve alcohol, and I'm sorry, but slow city approval is not an excuse, you shouldn't open an international brand like Four Seasons hotel without all your approvals in place unless you want to suffer poor reviews (especially annoying that they display empty wine bottles in restaurant and mention alcohol in the mini bar ensuite!) and they never fill your glass…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Two seconds later, the car behind us slammed into our car. And so goes my trip to Casablanca. We had to wait nearly an hour for a report to be made before we could proceed on to the hotel.

The pool and spa were absolutely lovely, and the staff were some of the kindest and friendliest I've ever experienced at a hotel.

Too late already in my pj's so I sleep with balcony door open. -Room service, ordered cheeseburger with bacon but get one with turkey. -Lunch order a water but get a cola. -Breakfast order eggs over easy but get eggs over well done. -retrieving my car at entrance takes 30 minutes. -Breakfast order eggs sunny side up, no toast served and table is cleared before I return from the buffet bar (hence no silver wear, butter salt pepper and o.j. any more) Return to my room after breakfast and cleaning staff is waiting at the door to clean my room so opt to sit on the…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2016,5,Great new Four Seasons in Casablanca,"We loved our stay here. The hotel is gorgeous, the food is amazing and the staff were fantastic.

Every guest has to try the buffet!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2016,5,Total Luxury and Relaxation,We had an amazing room that looked over both the pool and the ocean. The beds were among the most comfortable we have encountered.

 June 2016,5,"Great service, amazing staff",We had a wonderful time in this hotel. The staff were exemplary and accommodated our every request. The friendliness of the staff and their willingness to help made our stay in Casablanca a very enjoyable experience. We were there during Ramadan and the concierge did a great job finding restaurants for us during this period and handling all the reservations. The hotel & facilities were modern and the buffet at Restaurant Bleu with a view of the sea and sunset was exceptional. We throughly enjoyed our stay and I would like to personally commend Read for looking after us so well and also for going out of his way to provide us with a deck of cards. It's small gestures like that which makes this stay so memorable.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2016,3,Be aware...,"We asked for early check-in and we had to wait an hour for our room to be ready! Not great after an 8h flight. The rooms are really nice, the vue is ok the beach is super crowded so it is not really relaxing. We went down to the restaurant for lunch and to our surprise they don't serve alcohol in the hotel. It is not mentionned anywhere. The food at both restaurants is not great. In general the hotel is very well decorated and the rooms are spacious but the service is not great.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Rooms are clean set up is perfect with eye to details, decoration inspired from moroccan tradition but kept the four season standards. One of the staff who made our stay comfortable and went on her way to ensure we get everything we request, Mrs Caroline in reception had made us feel home and we had no issue even to find great places to dine in the city. She is always following up with other departments to make sure our requests are delivered to our room.

We highly recommend…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2016,3,An underwhelming hotel for FS standard,"I've stayed at many FS hotels worldwide and the one in Casablanca pales by comparison Pros: - Beach view but when the beach is crowded, which was the case when I stayed there, it could get quite noisy. - There's a mall next to the hotel in case you need to get a bite or buy some sundry items - Clean room and bathroom Cons: - We thought the premier room would be akin to suite as was in the case at FS Casablanca but it was not and looks like a regular room - Design of room didn't give an elegant feel, have seen similar designs at 4-star hotels - Shower drainage issue but was resolved after a complaint - Breakfast food wasn't great, my eggs tasted like soap - 2nd day breakfast service was subpar: waitress gave us a wrong order, didn't give us pepper that we requested, reached…",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2016,4,Tea and wonderful view,We went to the Four Seasons with a Moroccan friend for a late tea. He suggested this location as he considered it one of his favourite places for a maroccan tea. The view down from the outside balcony to tge sea is lovely especially with the setting sun. The Moroccan tea and biscuits was great. I struggle with the slow service but I have been told that this is typical. Beutiful hotel only a couple of years old and the decor is really nice.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2016,4,Some promising highlights,"Had a nice stay here for a few nights this week. The highlights were the pool area, the excellent breakfast with mesmerizing view and the kindness of the staff. Really a shame they still do not have an alcohol license and would not let us BYBO the fine French wines we brought knowing it was a dry hotel to have with our meals. I liked that they checked the cars and had a metal detector for those entering the hotel though noticed no one was there once or twice. Anyway, all was made up by the professional service and absolute helpfulness of Mohamed Bouhrou whose smile and attention to detail makes you feel so pampered.

 June 2016,4,Four seasons does not disappoint,I Booked a Beautiful Jr. Suite because it faced the ocean and gardens. Had a huge balcony as well. I normally like bigger rooms but the view was important and the next suite up only had partial ocean view plus price was crazy high. Paid $575 per night. Great in room dining and housekeeping. Had a few glitches in in room dining but mostly just a language barrier. Only select teas are loose leaf. Make sure you ask. Moroccan tea comes sweetened its very sweet so ask for unsweetened always if you don't care for the sweet. It will always come that way. But I loved the tea service once I knew which teas were loose leaf. Laundry service was lightening fast!and well done! Any request we had it was if they waited outside the door for us. Great staff. Bathroom has large tub and separate…,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2016,3,Still has a few things to work out,"Overall the hotel was nice - the grounds, location and gym were all fantastic. Not quite the luxurious feel of a top notch Four Seasons, but clean and well decorated. Service on the other hand needs some work. My husband and I arrived after the posted check-in time and had to wait over 30 min for a room. On top of that, we were escorted to get a tea or snack since we had to wait, only to be told we were expected to pay for our snack. It's the little things that distinguish a five-star hotel from those that are not and I think this hotel has a few things related to customer service to figure out before it reaches the top of the list.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2016,4,Good quality of service,"I did not have the chance to stay in that place; I just spent few moments in one of the restaurant with my wife for a drink. What I can say is that it's a well designed and decorated place. The view over the ocean on the twilight was stunning. Staff were very prompt to serve, and were very smiling. Another attraction of the hotel is the proximity of the shopping mall which is actually adjacent. I will certainly book there on my next trip to Casa.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2016,5,Very comfortable and luxurious stay,"I am in love with the 4 Seasons in Casablanca. I live in Sikasso, Mali, so my life can be a little rough. I don't have access modern amenities, so staying at the Four Seasons was literal heaven. The spa and fitness area is fantastic. The room is impeccable and I've never slept in such a comfortable bed.

My room was perfect luxurious interior with a ammienties needed, expecially the complementary welcome sweets and the espresso machine have been perfect.

 June 2016,5,The best afternoon tea in town,"We went on a Sunday afternoon to enjoy the afternoon tea at the hotel Mint Lounge Bar. It was highly recommended by friends and I must say it is rare to get this level of service, ambiance and quality in Casablanca. The scones are perfect and despite there was no cluttered cream, the chantilly cream was a good alternative. Great atmosphere and great Ambiance with one of the best views of the atlantic ocean in Casablanca. Top Service by Mohamed and Sabrina.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The building and rooms are nice for a hotel in casablanca. The location is great as the hotel is next to the beach. The service is excellant. They will help you in any way possible. A man named mohamed in the dining room stands out as one of the best employees I have met at a four seasons. Mr. Gates would be proud of him.,Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2016,5,Great place to have lunch,My wife and I went for a short lunch at the four season Mint Bar. They serve delicious food.

 May 2016,4,Good stay,"I loved the location. Right on the ocean. The view is incredible, the rooms are excellent, The staff are generally very friendly, especially Nada at t he reception. She is by far one of the best dedicated receptionists I have ever met. The blue restaurant is very good. I recommend it. The negatives: I got my car damaged there. The valet parking guy scraped the rim. Other staff members were not as attentive or friendly.

 May 2016,5,Enjoying my stay very much,"This is a really Oasis in Casablanca. The internal garden and sea views are a welcome respite from Casa's less than consistently appealing qualities. Be warned - there is no alcohol license (yet) ,but the quality of the rooms, the comfort of the beds and the remarkably consistent excellence of the staff make it well worth staying here. Nada, Noureddine and Houna on reception/conceirge have been consistently helpful and charming. Mariam in the spa responded to my casual compliment about the incense she was burning by finding me in the gym and giving me some. The pool area is pleasant. The gym is clean and big enough, with immaculate equipment. Would be good if it had been designed to have some daylight though.

 April 2016,5,Excellent,"The best in Casablanca , location, staff, view, food. It good for relaxation and business meeting. Some how I got the feeling that they are so susbesius when you have a meeting with females and they give you the feeling that you are watched which I think because most of the staff came from areas with bad back ground. Management need to look at this and give the feeling that you and you guest ( desert guest) are welcome. I had to leave early and move my meetings to Mazgan beach and resort because of this feeling my team had!!!! I will go back one day and that would be for fun not for meetings or business. I can understand that they just opened but again they need to be more welcoming for any one and no need to be susbesius from all ladies.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The staff went above and beyond on so many occasions. From the chocolates and sweets and well-wishes placed in our room when we arrived to the gorgeous breakfast we enjoyed each morning to the couples massage, we were wrapped in luxury and comfort for our entire stay. We loved Casablanca as well, because it is not as ""touristy"" as some other places in Morocco. More importantly, we loved this hotel.

I was told by a member of staff that they are still waiting for a licence, over three months after opening. I was instructed by bar staff to cross the road and go to the bar in an adjacent hotel. The bar was great and I'll stay at this alternative hotel next time! - such a pity, as the FS is actually a very nice hotel in all other respects. I expect a dry hotel in Riyadh, but not in Casablanca, where the local beer (""casablanca"") is very good!",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The lanterns, carpets, wall hangings, ceilings, light fixtures, all interesting with Berber flair. The rooms are nice, well appointed and spacious with complementing bathrooms. My experience is you are better off just coming for tea or coffee in the lobby with a beautiful view of the sea. We booked two rooms as I was traveling with my wife and two teenage daughters. One of the rooms was an Ocean View Premier Room which I was very excited about as I thought a wonderful room with a view after a few nights in the Sahara.

I'd been traveling about Morocco for weeks and needed a great night's rest and a good gym and boy did they ever provide both. That said, they're still working out kinks, like their liquor license (they don't have one yet), architectural aspects of the newly opened floors (would be easy to shatter a shower door), and the general availability of hot water.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Charming location in the ""Beverly Hills"" of Casablanca, with direct access to the beach, and a short taxi ride from the city center. Beautiful public spaces, with the lobby and outdoor pool being our favorites. Comfortable room in typical FS style, with balconies opening to the gardens and sea. Dining options include an all day lobby lounge, where breakfast and afternoon tea is served (great space and food), and an evening, fish-oriented restaurant. The best part: some of the best service in the FS chain. Thank you for a great weekend! PS. Point of improvement: the public beach in front on the hotel, although not part of the FS complex, could use some ""trimming"".

The Casablanca Four Seasons experience is not quite there, but given that the hotel has been open officially for only 2 weeks, it's making a decent stab. The reception was great: from the presentation of room keys to showing us round our rooms, this was the familiar experience. But then I found out that the swimming pool was only open from 10am to 5pm: useless for those of us staying on business and looking forward to a morning swim before heading to the office.

It's a brand new construction - not a refurbishing of an older property - so everything was brand new. Pros: amazing beds, pillows, linens and towels; a fantastic shower; (for a hotel) a good fitness center; nice pool area with direct access to beach Cons: while the décor and architecture are lovely, you could be just about anywhere; some of the staff need a little more experience on the job, but I am sure will get there.",Four_Seasons_Hotel_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
