 December 2018,1,"Appalling, lying and racist - worst experience of my life","There were a myriad of problems: #1 - the staff was unbelievably unprofessional, lacking in the minimum of social graces. He should be fired, and I've never said this about anyone until now. He was unsuited to work in the service industry. There was never a ""welcome"", ""thank you"" ""please"" or ""sorry"" The only acceptable reason for this staff's behaviour would have been mental illness or incapacity, and I do not believe that was the case. The staff member is racist. #2 - We did not receive what we reserved. There was no apology or explanation. This was unacceptable. #3 - Staff did not accept credit cards, demanded payment in EUROS and gave change in Dirham. This was super sketchy, we did not receive a receipt. #4 - Wifi was promised, guaranteed in the reservation and unavailable.…",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2015,1,Cockroaches!!! Gross!!,"Myself and Fiancee stayed here for 4 nights at mid-april 2015. Despite the fact that i had booked a double room we were presented with 2 single beds. We were also greeted by an elderly chap named Muhammed as soon as we arrived in the taxi. Muhammed then told us of the tour he will take us on so we could get some 'amazing couscous'. It was rather late at night and we were both starving hungry so we really just wanted food. Muhammed the proceeded to take us on a tour and took us to a restaurant. When there he tried to sell us something ""good to smoke that is legal in this country"". He then tried to con us out of more money by telling us that he usually gets paid lots for his tours.. Now what i expect of a tour and what he gave us are completely different. Nevertheless, we wanted…",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2015,5,Nice quite hotel for a night,"I stay at Marco Polo only for one night. It was in a very good location, not in the medina and it was easy to find. It was quite, there weren't many other guests there. The restaurant looked closed though, staff was friendly, room had a working TV, and showers were hot.",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2014,2,used to be much better,"The hotel needs renovation and animation. The price is ok but the quality of the rooms is not that good. It used to be much better with lovely people. Too bad this is not the case anymore. Still, if you choose to stay in this hotel, you will find yourself near to the beach and some night clubs and bars. ( if you are that type of a person)",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2014,1,Women travellers - Beware of the sleazy afternoon shift guy!,"The hotel itself is ok, quite clean, quiet, big windows. But the TV in my room did not work and the A/C did not work either, so it was quite cold there at night. However, the really bad part is the staff, especially the short guy who works the afternoon shifts. He does not communicate in any way, does not answer when you say something to him or ask him something, never looks at you, does not even answer when you say Hi. But the worst part is what he DOES do. When I was sitting in the lobby using the wifi (Btw the wifi only works in the lobby) he put on a porn channel in English and purposely turned it up very loudly. It was a female voice describing quite vulgarly certain things. I was the only person in the lobby so I left the lobby and when I turned back while leaving, I saw…",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2013,1,best avoided,"For its actual quality and facilities etc. I should be giving the Marco Polo hotel a significantly higher grade. It’s actually quite nice. Its facilities are more than adequate, though it would do well to either downgrade its prices a little or upgrade its facilities a little – it has priced itself to be competing with mid-range options and it doesn’t quite cut it – it would do much better as an excellent budget option than as a B-grade mid-range. But again, if I were only reviewing quality of facilities etc., I’d give it a 3, maybe even a four. The reason I give it only one (and it is lucky to get that!) is the stunningly, extraordinarily bad service. I mean seriously, these guys take bad service to a whole new level. I have been travelling for 25 years and I have never…",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2013,3,Not bad at all for the money,"I stayed in the Marco Polo for four nights during a recent visit to Tangiers. The hotel is situated near the port and is quite convenient for the sea front and the old town. At the moment, a new marina is being constructed directly opposite the hotel - so as you come out of the door, you are faced with great plies of rocks and gravel. From outside, the hotel is not very prepossessing, but inside, it is fine. My room was reasonably well appointed, the bed was comfortable and the sheets and towels were clean. The staff were quite pleasant and helpful. The online site that I booked the hotel through said that wi-fi was available in the bedrooms and that breakfast was available. This proved not to be the case. There was no breakfast available and wi-fi only worked in the reception…",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2013,3,Adequate for a night or two,"CONTEXT My first visit to Morocco. An introductory tour of Moroccan cities by train and bus. Stayed at a Riad in Marrakech to begin with, am staying in a four star in Agadar at the end for three nights, and in between have stayed at low-price hotels, such as the Marco Polo in Tangier. I have booked a night in advance as I travel, which has often limited availability and choice. I stayed here in early January and paid 31 euros for the night. PROS Located close to the city centre and old quarter. On the beach front with many options nearby for food. Clean. Friendly staff. Free WIFI in room. Air Con. CONS There was a mini-bar or fridge left in the room and not connected to the mains. Whether they had forgotten to take it away or not plug it in, it was an oversight. …",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2012,4,Not as bad as some people say...,"We spent one night here and i would say this hotel is much better compared to a lot of riad/medina hotels in the old town. Check for air conditioning, bathroom cleanliness and you are good to go. We paid 30 euros (offseason price) and it is much better price compared to the 40 euros they ask for a night in a Medina riad. We were not asking for a guide, i guess that's why we do not had any negative experience here with the hotel.",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2010,1,Not receommended,"I have been travelling now for 6 months and I have submitted 5 Hotel reviews on trip advisor, all of them have been positive and unfortunately I have felt compelled to enter my first negative review. As accurately described by Lonely Planet this mid-range hotel is generic in appearance and character. The Hotel and the large room was adequate. The staff offered their hospitality in a detached but polite manner. They charge for use of the Safe and to purchase a poor quality map and there is no wifi. However, the major problem for me as a solo woman traveller was in the Hotel’s recommendation for a guide. As advised by Lonely Planet, I sought recommendation from my Hotel for a reputable guide for half a day to show me Tangier. Unfortunately my guide was unprofessional and…",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2010,5,Nice Hotel - Good Location,"We arrived in Tangiers and checked out this hotel based on a recommendation in our travel guide. The room was clean and large enough to enjoy a multi-day stay. The staff were very helpful and friendly, located down on the waterfront and close to the old town.",Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2010,2,spoiled by working girls and staff,hotel is overpriced and sells itself on location across busy road from beach. Problem is the bar you walk through/past to get to hotel part of business is frequented by hookers in cohorts with staff. Evening is used by truck drivers and the young girls who sit there hoping to be chosen ( or throw themsleves on you ) and staff waiting for bribes to let girls go. apart from that decent rooms in hotel lol,Hotel_Marco_Polo-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
