 December 2022,5,Superb modern hotel in the middle of the city,We checked into the property on the last leg of our Morocco vacation and we were not disappointed. We booked a Sea-view room overlooking the Hassan II mosque and the views were exactly how they were promised. Check-in was smooth and we received help for our baggage right from the road. The hotel is fairly modern and it shows in the way the rooms are set-up. Bathroom is well stacked and room-service is responsive. WiFi is more than decent for your needs.

But the main issue is the airport shuttle. Do not paid for the service, you will paid double than a grand taxi, for something smelly and uncomfortable. It's so easy to get a taxi from the airport, and to get to it, there is a grand taxi stand just in front of the hotel door! Don't waist your money, and help the taxi drivers instead. We have paid 800 MD (80 euros, and way more the advertise on the website) for a service in a car that obviously needed some repair and look nice only in the dark and was very, very smelly (heavy cigarets sent).

The breakfast was one of the best we have from many others hotels. They care of everything, always ready to help and solve all of our requests. The minus of this hotel is rooms cleaning service, not because they did not clean but because they always forgot to supply a lot of amenities.

The staff was excellent, room spacious and the pool was very welcome on a hot day. My only complaint was that there was no separation between the bathroom and bedroom. I was traveling with my teenage children so a shower that one could see into from the bedroom was not OK. They moved us to a room that had a curtain as a divider (which they should do with all the rooms) and, although the room was a downgrade from our booked room, it was fine.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The hotel lobby is beautiful and the hotel itself you can tell is very new and very well maintained. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very well cleaned. Osama and the entire bellhop and front desk staff were not only very well trained and helpful but they went the extra mile to make sure the hotel guests were safe.

 June 2022,4,nice stay,"Overall good hotel, very nice view of the water & mosque from the 8th floor, helpful and friendly staff, but C'MON definitely not a 5 star hotel, there were hardly any toiletries available, there was not even a bar soap! I though they just forgot to leave it in the room and asked the front desk, they were looking for a while but couldn't find any!? Also, the towels were pretty worn out! The open concept design of the room where the only way to have a private shower is to use the curtain that runs between the bathroom area and the main room area is inconvenient in many ways, Good location though, about 20 min nice walk to the mosque, Nice pool, breakfast was ok",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We had a queen room that overlooked the city, with the Hassan II Mosque in the distance. Speaking of, if you're looking to see the Mosque, I'd recommend to skip paying for a taxi ride there. It's only a short twenty minute walk through a relatively safe neighborhood. Overall, the hotel seemed very well maintained and new. There's a lot of space to spread out, they have a huge modern lobby, and a relaxing rooftop pool with plenty of seats.

The only hiccup was at check in they had significant delays finding our reservation and servicing our room so we ended up waiting over an hour. When you prepay for the nicest suite that was a bit tough but they did comp our drinks and lunch while we waited so we felt that was fair.

Also they speak very good English at this hotel too. I believe they are given money toward Spanish lessons by Barcelo group which is think is great! The rooms and hotel are exceptionally clean at all times along with the pool area too. The bed is super big and super comfy which I loved! I can’t fault the hotel. Again I want to reiterate my point regarding the staff at this hotel as they were amazing and so…,Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2022,4,Comfortable stay in Casablanca,"We were there just for 1 night, but it was a comfortable stay. nice rooms. Bit stuffy in the hallway. The rooms are all equipped with what ever you need.

 April 2022,5,Excellent stay,"The hotel is very modern, spotless with comfortable beds, and the food was good. The staff were exceptionally helpful in making dinner reservations and advising us on touring the city. A nice bellman walked us to the ATM. The only downside was that the sink/shower area is open to the room and we would have liked more privacy.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2022,2,No no no,"Sorry but I read the reviews of this place prior to booking and all of them sounded really good. We stayed here three nights and I’m sorry but I cannot recommend this spot. Location is HORRIBLE. There are no restaurants in the area. No shopping. And the area is nasty and not somewhere that I would consider safe. The area is a short ride to the mosque and mall 5-10 minutes. Breakfast was ok. Had lots of options not many hot options. We were offered an omelette on our second day but not the first. We did book during Ramadan and that was my oversight. But we did eat at the buffet spread on our first night which was 49 per person. When I tell you that food was GONE and NOT replenished they ran out of meat, no hummus, no naan and many of the dishes were empty. Was not worth my…",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2021,5,Searching for a Manhattan in Morocco,"Ending a great two week visit in Morocco, I only had one regret: I hadn’t been able to find a good Manhattan anywhere. Shoot, I couldn’t find any Manhattan. Nothing in Rabat, Fes, Marrakech and Meknes. As a Kentucky-born boy, I’d grown used to having a Manhattan. Finally, in Casablanca, at the Barcelo Anfa Hotel bar, I found the bartender I had been looking for: Safuihne. He told me that, yes, he could make a Manhattan. And it was a great Manhattan. Worth the wait. Beautiful golden brown, straight up with no “accessories” to muddle the taste. And chilled to perfection. I savored every sip. Thanks, Safuihne and Barcelo Anfa Hotel, for a wonderful stay. You made my visit to Morocco complete. Best wishes for your continued success.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

Check in was easy although even though we paid extra to get into our room early we still had to wait about 30 min while they checked our room and it seemed that they sprayed a lot of Lysol type spray in it, so we had to open windows to air it out for a bit. But otherwise the room was clean, nice view of the pool, comfortable beds, nice bathroom and amenities. We sat by the pool for a glass of wine and snack of crisps / chips and it was lovely. We also walked to the Hassan Mosque and found the area to be nice and walkable. For dinner we used room service and the food, service, presentation and value was phenomenal.

We had a tour on the day of our arrival, and they were able to accommodate us early. The front desk staff speaks great English, and it was easy to communicate with them. Our room was very nice, clean, and comfortable. We booked the Premium Sea View room with a king bed, and it was so worth it. The view is absolutely incredible! The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly, especially Ricardo and Yasmine - they were fantastic, and helped us with many of our various inquiries and needs throughout our stay.

 April 2021,5,Swanky hotel!,"I stayed at this hotel for my final night in Morocco after a 4 day trip in Marrakech. Given the pandemic it was not crowded at all but I enjoyed tapas and wine in the lobby lounge, and sat a while by the pool (though it was still a bit too chilly to take a dip). The room was beautiful and swanky. I would imagine this place to be quite perfect for a business trip as well as a relaxing urban oasis in Casablanca.

 October 2020,4,Totally recommend,I stayed here for approximately 11 days. Now let me start by saying the hotel is gorgeous! The interior of the rooms are just simply amazing the pictures don’t do it’s justice. The staff is very helpful they assisted with anything and everything possible which was greatly appreciated. The bartender (Hassan) was my favorite employee. My first night there he treated me like he knew me for years and his drinks were on point! The only reason why I didn’t give this a 5 star is because frankly there are no microwaves in the rooms so if I needed to heat up my food I had to go down to the restaurant to ask the employees (which they had no problem doing) and the WiFi isn’t that great. Other than those two things I loved my stay!,Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

For a 4 or 5 star hotel, the superior room rate with breakfast was $65.14. The location is within walking distance to the Hassan II Mosque. My room was large, super clean, an extensive breakfast and an excellent restaurant, and great staff. I rarely write hotel reviews, but Nabi Lo provided exceptional customer service.

 March 2020,4,Be careful what room you select,"The Barcelo Anfa was a beautiful hotel. Very friendly staff. The lobby/lounge/restaurant were all as you would expect. First class. Alcohol is served in the lounge and restaurant as you listen to live entertainment in the bar area. The only surprise we had was our room. I reserved a deluxe king room. The room was immaculate, bright and modern however there was no separate area for the bathroom. It was all in one room. The toilet had its own little room but the glass doored shower and vanity was all part of the bedroom. I enjoyed it but my wife likes a little more privacy. Lol Stay here.

 February 2020,5,Relaxing stay,"Needed to rejuvenate between 3 tours. We stayed just for a night between our Turkey and Morocco tour and this hotel and its staff made that happen. Ismail over in reception (front desk) was efficient and more importantly, welcoming with a great sense of humor. We stayed there on Feb. 20, 2020 and booked 3 rooms. Bellhop group was also very helpful especially when we needed a taxi. They advised us of what would be a reasonable fare. In Morocco nearly everything is negotiable.

 February 2020,4,Very Nice but Not a True 5 star hotel,"I have been traveling in Morocco for 26 days and have decided to catch up with all my hotel and restaurant reviews. With the benefit of so many places to compare, I believe my reviews reflect an accurate description of these places in the market. This hotel is quite nice, and in a good area. But the confusion starts with this hotel chain having 2 hotels with the same name, on the same street, within 4 blocks of each other. Taxi drivers seem to always go to the lower priced location. Once we knew, it was easy to fix. But our taxi from the airport dropped us at the wrong location, which created a great deal of confusion, and wasted time after a long flight.

We were seen to our room by one of the bell hops, which was great! Room faced the pool and it was very quiet, which we appreciated. Window opened, which helped bring in fresh air. Room was very large but with a weird layout. Shower and sink are separate from the toilet but the shower/sink are next to the bed. Another reviewer said this could be awkward when staying with other friends. Shower was heavenly and towels were always clean.

 January 2020,5,Casablanca.,"Casablanca was the last stop of our trip in Morocco. Our stay at the hotel was great. The hotel was so close to many sight seeing attractions, that you cAn even walk to them. Staff at the hotel are very nice.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,3,Pleasant stay but could have been better,"Barcelo Anfa is in a great location and stepping into the hotel, you'd think you're in a different country. The hotel is immaculate and very clean, not to mention the superb breakfast. The junior suites were also very nice and spacious. Taking a shower was very comfortable because of its over-the-head stream and high pressure. If you stay here, you will definitely be satisfied. My main issue was with the front desk. I don't believe things were very organized (although I will say Ismail was very sharp and knew what he was doing -- still waiting for that ""free breakfast""!). When we checked out of the hotel, we got our bill which was like 5-7 pages long.... and everything is in a different language, it's hard to understand what you're looking at. I don't know why a bill needs to…",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2020,3,Please acknowledge the customer,"I made many complaints about the reception, and how the greeting is not properly done. The managers addressed the proper training, but nothing changed. I am usually arriving late night very tired after a long day of traveling, flying and working, in front of the desk not even a smile or a greeting, last night I felt so embarrassed and neglected I waited for a long time standing before starting to ask for help. I asked the lady if there is something wrong. The excuse is that she is busy with a small group.... The secret is : acknowledging the customer with a greeting or a smile and manage the expectations of your customer or .....beeeeep Please address.... M. Alouani",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,5,Incredibly amazing hotel,"PROS: - Top designed 5 star hotel with unique room layout, particularly the bathroom - The big mirror between the shower room and bed is one of the most genius things I’ve ever seen - Very spacious room overall - Creative lobby area which feels very comfortable - The breakfast was sensational, everything was set up with every detail and much love, the shapes, structures, colours, portions, definitely the best in my whole travel in Morocco",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,5,Wonderful hotel in Casablanca,We loved our stay at this hotel. Great room on the top floor with great views of the Hasan II Mosque and the ocean. Great buffet. The only thing we did not like was that the shower and the bathroom sink were all open to and within the room (although thankfully the toilet was closed off).,Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,5,At long last the perfect Casablanca hotel for me!,"I make it once or twice a year to Casablanca on business and have always been underwhelmed by my hotel experiences (and the Four Seasons is outside my budget). This hotel, on the other hand, exceeded all my expectations. It has a superb downtown location, a 5-minute walk from the American Consulate. Very spacious room decorated in a contemporary style, as is all the hotel. I am usually not a fan of no walls between the bathroom and bedroom but here it works quite well. The toilet is in another area, with door for privacy. Excellent WiFi in the room and throughout the hotel. I ate dinner in the hotel’s ground-floor restaurant – delicious steak and fries, good wine list. The lobster salad appetizer could be improved, though. A buffet-style breakfast with everything one could…",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,4,Good,"Good location, very clean. Taxi right outside the hotel. About a mile to the Hasan II Mosque. The front registration desk didn't speak English very well which was quite surprising given the fact that all the tiny Riads we had stayed in spoke much better English or at least tried to converse with our French/English/minimum Arabic. They also didn't have an area map.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,5,Casablanca stay.,"Casablanca has a lot to offer in terms of sightseeing and exploring. The hotel is located on Boulevard Anfa, a few minutes drive or walk to all major attractions.

He was quick and efficient with our check in all while flashing a great smile! The guys that helped us up the steps and with our luggage were great too! The room was clean, comfortable, modern and just what I expected from the website. Ended up staying in for dinner at the bar and it was not a mistake! Ibtissam and Souffian? were AWESOME! Thanks to Ibtissam we enjoyed the delicious lamb tagine and Souffian kept our thirsts quenched....Even recommending a great Moroccan wine! I'd definitely recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay in Casablanca with great service.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2019,5,Modern Urban Convenience,"Nice hotel in a central location. A variety of restaurants close by in walking distance. Nice city views from the 10th floor. Casablanca is a noisy city, so I didn't open my balcony door. Room had all the amenities that I would expect. Buffet breakfast was nice--lots of choices including healthy and pork options. I chose to pay separately and not include breakfast in my room rate, since there are also breakfast options nearby. Staff was friendly and helpful, especially the parking valet. My stay here was easy and comfortable.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,5,Pleasant stay in Casablanca,We have stayed in and enjoyed several stays in Barcelo hotels in Europe. The Barcelo Anfa Casablanca meets European standards.

I definitively recommend and will stay there again would I need to be in town.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,5,Work trip,We were here for 3 nights for a business trip. The hotel is located near the night market which by the way wasn’t anything spectacular however the hotel excels in its service. The rooms are on a smaller side but not too small. The service and the people is where this hotel excels at. Soufiane at the bar makes great drinks and you can talk to him for hours. Hajar from housekeeping made the room looked new every single day Amine from room service is like a bullet. He would bring whatever you ask for within minutes:) Thank you all for making it a great trip and I hope to come stay here again.,Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,5,Clean Casablanca Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Barcelo Anfa Hotel during our recent trip to Casablanca. The staff was amazing and extremely patient given our lack of speaking the language. The room was perfect. The only struggle is the hotel faces a busy street and it got pretty noisy at times. Other than that, it was a great place to stay.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,5,Very Nice Hotel!,Our tour of Morocco began with a one night stay in Casablanca at this very new and modern hotel. I wasn't particularly impressed with its location though as it seemed like a long trip from the airport through a maze of winding streets and there didn't seem to be much in the area that seemed worth exploring. But location aside this is a very nice hotel. Our room was very nicely appointed....even bordering on luxurious I would say. We had a nice balcony overlooking a busy street which allowed for entertaining views of the chaotic Casablanca traffic. The bed was comfortable and the shower and vanity area were ultra modern and well functioning. The room was quite spacious and the wifi signal was decent...even out on the balcony. The service at the front desk and provided by…,Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2019,5,Make sure you book the ANFA,"Hotel has been open just over 1 year.....very nice staff, good food in the restaurant, and very nice value. They do have some large tour groups coming and going, but I think that will slow down once they are more established. Only suggestion is to have a business lounge...needed to scan and print documents....only way was to e-mail them to Hotel to print....not ideal.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

We loved the unique room design! The pool area is large and feels like a resort, which is great considering the location is in the heart of the hustle and bustle of Casablanca. The location is perfect for exploring the city - it's a quick walk or cab ride to everything. Lots of restaurants nearby for any meal of the day. The staff were great here. A very special thank you to Soufian and Hassan in the bar area for their tremendous hospitality! Also - Taha handled our check-in wonderfully.

The pool area is nice but the drinks service could have been better. One thing that I wish they had mentioned is they have a sister hotel with a similar name in the same street, our driver took us to the wrong one, as did 3 other people while we were there. Make sure you are clear on the address.

The on duty manager found out that it was my birthday and had housekeeping make up a surprise set-up on the bed with animals made out of towels and rose petals scattered on the bed after we left in the morning. When we got back to the hotel later that evening, I was pleasantly surprised with the little decor. Little did I know that there was more in-store! The concierge team had kept a lookout for our return and in under 10 minutes that we got back, they popped up and had prepared a birthday cake and were singing a birthday song in the corridor outside the room!

 July 2019,5,A breakfast to remember,The room is a lot bigger than what we expected. It is clean and the double sink outside the shower and restroom is a welcomed innovation for us couple.

Arrived last night and was greeted well in the lobby - check in was quick, and was escorted to the room by the concierge. First impression of the room was that it was big, modern and cozy. Liked the unconventional designing of an island washbasin and mirror. The room is complete with all bathroom amenities and a tea-coffee station with a kettle. There is a big TV screen which plays many international channels, and was surprised to see an Indian channel as well! Has a small patio, perfect place to have your morning tea/coffee.

There were plenty of thoughtfully placed lights in the room, and there were USB charging points as well as regular electrical sockets. The room was equipped with a kettle, a laptop-sized safe, and a huge TV (which I was not able to work out how to use). The room was left clean and tidy every day.

They have thought of everything at this lovely spot!",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 March 2019,5,Stylish,"What a beautifully stylish place is the Casablanca Barcelo Anfa Hotel. It is clean and modern with artistic touches making it an interesting and pleasant place to stay. However its best feature is its wonderful staff they were all friendly and helpful. All were impressive but Bader on the restaurant area was particularly good. Complimentary bottled water, biscuits, wifi and a generous bowl of fresh fruit were much appreciative. The breakfast food presentation and range were excellent. I have only a minor criticism relating to the scrambled eggs which were a bit runny, not overly so, but not to my liking although others may well have found them fine. Overall, it was a real pleasure to be able stay there.",Barcelo_Anfa_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
