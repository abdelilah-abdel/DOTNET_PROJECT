 October 2022,5,Great Landing Place in Casablanca,"Landing in Casablanca for a five week trip in Morocco, we needed someplace clean and comfortable to get over our jet lag.

We ate dinner at the hotel cafe our first night - the food was basic and tasty. Breakfast buffet was expansive, with plenty of choices, and fresh omelette. Close to the Hassan II mosque, we found the public space surrounding the mosque clean and family-friendly place. (Be sure to plan for a guided tour of the mosque!)

The food is good. My apartment was very spacious enough and always at a comfortable temperature with individual controls for each apartment. Strangely (to me anyway) 'cool' seems to be considered 'cold' here. The fridge in the room and the cokes served in the bar - dining - smoking area are, at best, cool. Ironically, the bathroom is tiny. I weigh just over 160, but if I were any heavier I would have trouble turning around in the square shower or getting in/out of the double sliding doors.

The shower was very high to reach and I'm only 4ft 11 so I had to hold the shower instead, but I found this was the case in most hotels and riads throughout Morocco. Staff didn't seem as welcoming as other places in Morocco but that was absolutely fine. Breakfast was OK but had better in other places. They didn't have any juice.

The location is great, it's super walkable. The room was quite big, which was a pleasant surprise. The breakfast was good, it had several options (and not just bread). It's about a 40 minute drive from the airport. The seal on our shower door was broken so water got all over the bathroom. My main complaint is that the bed and pillows were so comfortable.

Breakfast was pretty good with lots of variety. The views from the rooms are nothing special because they all face away from the Mosque. Except for the most expense unit which has a view of the mosque and ocean. If the hotel isn't booked, you can get a deal on that unit for 100Euro. There are some good restaurants a short taxi ride away (Rick's and Squale. We chose Squale and we were glad we did.)

In my case I had to work from the lobby for almost all day long and waiters just kept on asking if I am fine, switching off the music of I was alone and needed some quite time for teleconferencing as well as kept on bringing coffee and tea!

The position is strategic, far from the chaos of the city and 5 minutes from the most beautiful sight of Casablanca: Hassan II mosque. The room is very spacious with all what is needed, with a small kitchen in case of need. There was also a small terrace, pity that we were not able to open the door, that was apparently broken. A part from this little inconvenient, I am completely satisfied. The breakfast was vary enough, maybe it should be given the possibility to have the real coffee from the real coffee machine.

Not once someone said ""Hi"" or ""How are you?"" Or even ""Welcome"" when we arrived. No one helped with our luggage. It seemed more like we were not welcome from the body language we could read of off the arabic conversation the guy at the front desk had with our very patient guide.

 December 2019,4,Nice hotel,Stayed 3 nights. Just 2 minutes walk to Hasan mosque. Marina mall is just 5 minutes drive. Breakfast was good but limited options. Sofia was excellent; she went out with us to find nearby restaurants and helped us to order good local dishes. Abdelbadie helped us a lot to order kfc. Outstanding service.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2019,3,Good location for Hassan 11 and Corniche,"With only 24 hours in Casablanca the Melliber was a great find. The room was clean and comfortable and we could see and hear Hassan 11 Mosque. The best aspect of our stay was the friendly and helpful attention we received from the staff, nothing was too much trouble even activating a Moroccan SIM card. Breakfast was included in our deal and it was excellent.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,5,Nice Hotel near the Mosque,We stayed at this nice Appart Hotel near the Mosque for one night. The room was large and clean with all the comforts. The breakfast buffet was very good with excellent choice of products. The hotel offers private parking in the garage. The staff was friendly and helpful.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,3,Could of been better,"One of the main reasons why I stood here was to be close to the Mosque and it absolutely worked out. The front desk was really helpful and wanted to know if I found my stay comfortable and if I had any questions on trying to get somewhere. Breakfast was pretty good and had lots of options of food. BUT when it came to the actual room...I have concerns. The bathroom had a moldy smell and could tell it wasn't cleaned enough. The bed needed more pillows and I'm talking about actual good pillows (Not the short ones because those are horrible) The bed did have some stains on it AND I legit heard someone having sex from what it sounds like from the staircase. Now I understand this is a hotel, but my room was facing the staircase and I heard it directing from it. I've heard great things…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,4,Spacious rooms,"Convenient for parking, friendly staff, and spacious rooms. Not what I would consider an apartment. Kitchen is barely fit for purpose. Balcony with views. Restaurant is overpriced and not very high quality. Overall, pretty good as a base.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,4,Good hotel but dirty toilet.,"It name itself a apartment hotel, I stay in the cheapest apart room, nothing like a apartment, better called just a hotel room, kitchen have a stovetop but nothing else can use to cook, toilet is dirty with yellow marks, pillows having some cigarette smell. Good location next to Hassan II Mosque, very friendly helpful staff, good breakfast, comfortable bed and good air conditioning.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,4,Nice mid range hotel,"The rooms are spacious with all you need plus a small kitchenette. The staff is very friendly and helpful. And there is a lot of personnel available in case you need assistance. We also used the breakfast at the hotel. Normally we try to find something elsewhere but as there is little options in the area, we were happy that the breakfast provided was very good. There are plenty of options and there is a chef that will make your favorite omelet on the spot. The only (slight) drawback is the location. It is very close to the top attraction for Casablanca, the Hassan II mosque and museum. Other than that there is not much else in the area.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,5,Great place,"Stayed 2 nights in November, huge rooms with great views and a massive seating area and also a kitchen area. Right near the mosque and the sea front. Restaurant and breakfast were fantastic and very reasonable. Reccommend this place",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,3,Decent hotel,"The hotel is located near the Mosque, however, there is not much to see near the hotel. Taxis are cheap and always available. The room is large with a kitchenette and the service was good and breakfast was good. Good for a reasonable stay for a short duration.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,3,Good location,"We stayed at this hotel as part of our 8 days tour of Morocco, hotel is located very close to the mosque , front desk staff very unfriendly , when I walked in he saw me and my friends , did not say anything until I approached him and asked him to check me in , had made copies of passports and have us complete forms which we did and we were given rooms . No information was provided about the hotel , no assistance with luggage , no greetings , he was acting as if we were a burden on him . Rooms are decent clean , spacious and bathroom was small but clean. Hotel management needs to train their front desk staff about basic customer service training .",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"My two friends and I enjoyed our stayed at this hotel and we would highly recommend it. Although it is 30 to 45 minutes from the airport, the location is actually very convenient and close to the Hassan 2 mosque. We could see the mosque from our balcony and it was sooo close to everything else we needed access to. I want to give a shout out to the lady at reception ( I don't know her name) but she recommended Umayya to us and we could not be more grateful for a wicked recommendation. We ENJOYED THAT RESTO A LOT AND WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR RECOMMENDING IT TO US. I also want to shout out to Achraf - it was his third day on the job and he was amazing and friendly. Overall, all of the staff were super friendly. We stayed at this hotel twice - once at the beginning and again at the…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2019,5,End of nostalgic trip round morocco,Lovely little hotel very close to the Hassan II mosque. Very quiet and staff extremely helpful. Breakfast is very nice and it is reasonably priced. There are plenty of tax’s around to take you to the various places of interest,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,4,Decent for one night but not good value for money,"Location is perfect as it’s short walk to the mosque. The rooms are comfy and clean. Our group occupied a few rooms and water from shower getting into the rest of the bathroom seems to be a common problem. The utensils are not all there, some had spoons and no forks or knives and vice versa. Staff at reception is ok, not as friendly or accommodating as the ones from Riads that we have stayed during our trip. Breakfast choice seems to be decent but quality of food is low. This hotel is quite pricey, overall not really good value for money.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,2,Two Stars,"Pros: location, location! Virtually next door to the Hassan II Mosque. Also, they give gratis four small bottles of water in your room. Cons: our bathroom was filthy - like, wear your shoes while in there, dirty. I have never experienced such a disgusting bathroom in a hotel room. It looked like the floor (and the toilet!) hadn't been cleaned in a long time and you guys.. IT WAS STICKY :( Also, when I inquired in to buying additional bottles of water, I was instructed to walk a couple of blocks to a supermarket. Having taken a taxi to the hotel, I knew that I'd be taking my life in my hands to walk across the avenue. For anyone interested, there's a hole in the wall type bodega literally one minute away. Go out the front door, take a left and walk approx 20 feet to the…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,3,Good for one night,"Good value. Reasonably clean, dated hotel. The pictures look better than the room and building we saw. No assistance to guests checking in: no map of offered assistance about things to do, etc. Very large room, close to Grand Mosque but nothing else in walking distance.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,4,Very Good hotel,My friend and I stayed one night at this hotel. It was very good. We were impressed by the size of the room. It was very clean and organized. Breakfast was good also. We also ate at the restaurant and food was very tasty.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2019,4,perfect location,"the hotel has a perfect locatio, just across the Hassan 2 mosque. the rooms are spacious, the breakfast is awesome and the staff are very helpful. the only minus was an unpleasent smell in one of the room we got, but it was changed immediately and also in the elevator. to summarize i recommend the place for short visit in Casablanca",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2019,5,"Great location, modern and comfortable room","I stayed here one night to see Casablanca. The location is a quick walk to the mosque which is probably the only reason to go to Casablanca. I did a walking tour to see the Medina and the mall, which was fine. back to the hotel, it was clean and had everything I needed. After staying in Riads for most of my trip, it was nice to have a typical European / American hotel stay. The room had bottled water, a king bed and a little kitchenette. I didn't get breakfast, but it was an affordable add on option. Check in and check out was smooth and the friendly front desk staff was able to hold my bags and call a taxi for my afternoon flight (300 MAD). Overall, I'd recommend this hotel.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2019,5,Best of Best,"From the time one walks in you are greeted with such hospitality and warmth it is of great pleasure. The staff in every department is of excellent demeanor and any request is fulfilled promptly. Most ideally located near the hallmark of the biggest mosque in Africa: Mosquee Hassan II, A jewel of Morocco. Facing the Sea. Breakfast is simply one of the best I ve ever had thruout Morocco. Thank you Melliber Appart Hotel Staff - too numerous to mention names. Staff is in accord with the wonderful hotel management.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2019,4,Good for one night.,"I booked and stayed at this hotel for one night before I headed off on a tour. The hotel itself is decent and the bed is nice, clean and comfortable. Compared to other hotels, this wasn’t bad. The free breakfast was just OK, nothing amazing. The location is great. It’s a few minutes walk from the Hassan II Mosque, which is literally right next door. You may get a room with a view of it. It’s also walkable to the medinas. One nice guy helped me find a taxi that wouldn’t try to trick me or rip me off. I really appreciated the gesture. I forgot to get his name!",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2019,3,Only good is location,"This place was a disappointment checked in for one night but were do I start? I'm not the one to complain but could hear everything on the street and in the hall, the bathroom is so small and cramped, shower is broken and water went everywhere, the lift buttons don't work properly and the sensor lights only stay on for 10 seconds while waiting for the lifts when you get it working. The only upside is the breakfast was ok and the staff in the restaurant were nice and caring and the location hence the 3 stars.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,4,Great Location,"We arrived and our room wasn’t ready, even though we had requested an early checkin after a long flight. While we waited we were attended to by the restaurant staff who were very friendly and attentive, making the time pass quickly. It wasn’t long and our room was ready. The studio room was large with twin beds, lounge area and kitchenette with tea and coffee facilities. If you wish to use the kitchen you need to inform the hotel before your arrival as it doesn’t have any utensils etc. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was on the small size considering the room was so large. The shower head bracket was broken and made showering difficult without flooding the floor. We fixed it by tying it up with a airline sock. We ate in the restaurant our first night and the food and…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,4,Central location,"Only stayed there for one night. I chose it because it's really close to Casablanca's main attraction, the mosque. The room is spacious, with a big bed ,however the building starts to show it's age and the room insulation is very poor, you could hear anyone from above, below or adjacent. Free parking is an added bonus, as it's very difficult to park in that area. 4 small bottles of water were also offered for free on my arrival (very much needed). The room had a balcony with a partial view to the mosque. The shower cabin is really small. Breakfast doesn't have that much variety and may not taste so ""western"". There is no fridge in the room",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2018,5,Phenomenal view of Blue Mosque,"I loved this hotel! The room was clean, beautiful, and with a direct view of the Blue Mosque. I enjoyed the meal and the service in the restaurant. The location and view of the ocean and mosque cannot be beat. I would definitely stay here again.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,5,As expected,"Location is great since we had only one day in casa and only wanted to visit Hassan II mosque, also close to the old Médina. The room was clean with good space and nice decor, staff were friendly and welcoming, and breakfast was descent. I wish they had 24 room service though, we got hungry late at night and couldn’t get food, but it wasn’t a big deal. Overall lovely stay, especially after we had a bad experience with the hotel before this one.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,4,"Good overall, but Item forgotten","I loved the space, great decor. Amazing buffet in the morning. Super nice staff. However, it is super difficult to communicate with them once you are not physically in the hotel. I am now back home on Canada and have realized I have forgotten a veste there tried reaching out to them through email, phone, whatsapp, nothing seems to work. I find It quite unfortunate.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,5,The most beautiful view of Casablanca,"We recently spent a couple days at Casablanca and stayed in Hotel Mellibier with the most spectacular views of the third largest Mosque in the world! At the heart of the city, the apartment was huge with the most comfortable beds and a plate of fruit provided that we thoroughly enjoyed. The hospitality of the staff particularly the breakfast attendees was outstanding as was the food. The daily cleaning was excellent and we were able to walk to the beach. I highly recommend this hotel not only for its convenience of location but fir its sharp decor and professional staff!",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,4,"Excellent hotel, clean and modern","We only stayed for one night, had lunch and breakfast in the hotel. We booked the smallest suite as it was a brief trip but this had a small kitchenette and decent shower room. We also had a terrace which had lovely views. Good location, few mins walk from the mosque. Easy to get to and from train station by taxi, staff were able to sort this for us. All staff were friendly and good selection of food at breakfast. Would happily stay again.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,4,A good choice near the Hassan II Mosque,"This hotel is an excellent choice near the main attraction in town: the Hassan II mosque. Some rooms even have a direct view of the mosque. The rooms are clean and convenient, have a stove, mini-fridge, and micro-wave. The restaurant is OK and the breakfast is of good quality. The hotel is a solid 3 stars hotel in my opinion, very positive experience, would stay there again.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,2,Poor service,The bathrooms need to be upgraded. Breakfast selection was small but decent. The AC wasn't working and reception did nothing about it even though I would call to complain 5 times a day. Location is the only bonus.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,5,Stopover,"We used Melliber appart hotel going and coming back from marrakesh. The hotel is located within few minutes walk to King Hassan mosque and about 12 min drive to Morocco Mall. Staff were super nice, helped us with our excess luggage and with our three small children. We had some transport issues going to marrakesh and the hotel helped us a lot by allowing us to stay a little later while our van arrived. Breakfast is nice. Overall a great experience with front desk, food and staff. On our return trip we only needed one room so the hotel was kind enough to waive cancellation costs.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,4,Great location to Hasan II Mosque,"We spent one night at the Melliber in Casablanca as a stop over before the adveture was to begin. We were greeted by friendly staff and a room upgrade. The room was HUGE with separate living and bed area. There was a small kitchenette (that we didn't use), but I'm sure it would be great for a longer stay and for families. The downside to our room was that the air conditioning didn't work and the seals in the shower need tending to, as while I showered I was slowly flooding the bathroom and water entered our room. The breakfast was good with a variety of choices, including an egg and crepe station. The hotel is located a short walk away from the mosque.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2019,5,excellent,"we had a very brief stay at this hotel. our luggage went missing and Rajah, named after her dad's football team, worked intensely on the phone to royal Air Maroc to try and locate the baggage, she repeatedly rang back looking for an elusive update. the luggage was found. the room we had was small but immaculate, clean. the location was great. all of the staff were helpful and courteous. i wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,4,"Great location, nice appartments","Very close to the Hassan II Mosque, the hotel is in a decent location and it only takes 25 minutes or so to walk to the centre of Casablanca. The apartments were spacious and decent enough for a short stay. Didn't get to try the restaurant/cafe downstairs but looked and sounded good.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2019,4,Short Stay,This was our one night stay on the last leg of our Moroccan trip. We stayed in Casablanca for one night and this hotel is conveniently located next to the most popular site in the city - the Hassan II Mosque. It is within walking distance to the mosque so you don't need to deal with any taxi drivers. Check in was smooth and the hotel is connected to a cafe/restaurant. Gym is quite small so it's not the hotel's greatest selling point. There is no pool. The room we got was 501. It did not have the view of the mosque but we have read that there are rooms that do get that view and that probably would've bumped this up another star. Oh well. The room is clean and neat. But it did not have any towels. We had to ask housekeeping for some towels after we got inside the room. …,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2019,5,Good location,The hotel is literally across the street from Hassan II mosque. Hotel has an underground parking and has nice breakfast. The staff was nice and professional. Safe neighborhood and lots of things to do around.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,5,"Nice spot, Far from airport.","Its not near the airport but a very nice place near the ocean and famous night clubs. The check in was fast and we found a nice note on our bed from the manager. Staff were helpful. Car parking available. Room's kitchen was really well equipped. My room view was overlooking a famous mosque and some old buildings' roofs. Food was really good but the restaurant was small. They sell gifts near the front desk which could save you some time shopping as they're selling the typical Moroccan gifts such as argan and olive oils, nuts and soap in nice bottles and packages.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,4,"Good location, clean and reasonably priced",We stayed here for a day before we did a 2 week tour of Morocco and for a night before we headed home. The people were really nice and accommodating by holding our luggage when we arrived early. Its not super fancy but comfortable. The place was clean and comfortable especially the suites. The location was great for access to the medina and the Hassan II mosque. I'd definitely stay again.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,Short overnight stay,"The room given was big and spacious. There is a small kitchenette (hot plate, microwave, crockery and basic utensils) for you to heat/make quick snacks and fix yourself some hot drink. There are generous amount of toiletries given. The bathroom is very small and compact. Its better to close the windows and sleep or it can be very noisy with the heavy traffic outside. So if you are light sleeper like me, better to bring earplugs or you will still hear some traffic outside!",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,5,Great experience,"I don't know if I have ever experienced a more sincerely helpful staff. We spent one night here after nearly 24 hours getting to Morocco from the US. The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. The room comfortable and well appointed. Location, great (next to the Mosque). Breakfast (included) very good and with a wide variety of options. I can't say enough good things about the staff though. Would not hesitate to visit again.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,5,Very comfortable,The hotel is very convenient to visit one of the largest mosques in the world. Although the city seemed to be somewhat run down the hotel was clean and comfortable with plenty of hot water. It was modern and suited to western wants.The staff were very friendly and helpful when we needed directions or to find an ATM. We were able to leave our luggage in a closet while we went sightseeing before we were allowed in the room.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,5,First stop on our Moroccan Trip,"We flew in to Casablanca after traveling for almost 24hrs, and with the airport being outside of town it was about a 45min drive to the hotel but you get to see the whole city on your way. We got there hours before check in but they got us a room early which was greatly appreciated. While we waited we ate in drank in their cafe which had great international food as well as local and for a decent price. The room was a good size and a had all the amenities one would need. Nice bathroom with a nice shower. Kitchenette which we didn’t use, stove top and mini fridge. Plenty of outlets, good climate controls, dark curtains, chairs, table, and desk.

We'd stay here again if in Casablanca!",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2019,4,Good to enjoy the Mosque view from the hotel room,老實說，Casablance景點對遊客來說真是不多，除了Hassan II Mosque，所以如果您前來卡薩布蘭卡參觀Hassan II Mosque，Melliber Appart Hotel酒店正是您的理想選擇。 步行1分鐘到清真寺！ 他們將我的住宿升級為一間臥室的房間，房間很乾淨，還有一個巨大的陽台，可以看到超級漂亮的清真寺景色。 但如果廚房裡有更多的東西可以提供，那將會很棒。例如: 熱電水壺 請注意，酒店周邊地區較少餐廳和旅遊商店，所以您可能需要乘坐出租車去更好的餐廳,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,3,Tired hotel but good staff.,The bathroom shower was very poor with little water pressure. We asked for the shower head to be changed but even the replacement was awful. The shower enclosure is so small that it's difficult to shower properly. We stayed in room 511. Location is very good as it's close to the beautiful Hassan 2 mosque,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,4,Close to Hassan II Mosque,"Stayed in Morocco for a week, spending the first and last night of our trip at the Melliber. Clean hotel with spacious rooms easily accommodating our family of 4. Rooms included a small kitchenette with microwave and fridge. They have a small but functional workout room. Biggest pros for our stay is its proximity to the Hassan II Mosque and the beautiful waterfront. Also, it is about a 10-15 minute walk to a cool and lively strip with restaurants and shops. Another plus was the on-site restaurant which was actually very good and convenient. Despite the mosque being very close, there were a few walking routes which were not very well lit. Not to say the areas is unsafe but there are spots of empty lots which didn't make late night strolling comfortable.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,4,Great location and comfortable accommodations!,"Warm, welcoming staff. Generous and clean accommodations. Newly renovated. Very conveniently located next to the Hassan II mosque. A must see in Casablanca. Ask for a room with a view of the mosque. The buffet breakfast was varied, good and plentiful. We'd stay there again.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2019,4,Very Comfortable with Good Location,"We stayed one night in Casablanca on our arrival in Morocco and again on our last night before our departure. We had a lovely suite on our first night, but an even better one facing the the Hassan II Mosque on our return. We had a beautifully appointed suite with a lounge with two comfortable sofa chairs, a dining table with two chairs and a writing desk with one chair. There are 4 plug points plus 2 USB ports to charge all your mobile phones and tablets at the same time. A very comfortable queen-sized bed led to a peaceful night's sleep. The bathroom is a bit small by comparison but had all the modern fittings, including a hairdryer. After the basic breakfasts at the Riads in Marrakech and Fes, the Melliber's is a veritable feast! We also appreciated the plate of fruit that…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,4,All good except the toilet,"Stayed there on our last day in Morocco only for visiting the big mosque. Spacious with living room and bedroom clearly separated. Comfy couches and bed, nice balcony accessible from both the living room and the bedroom with a superb view of the mosque. Also appreciated a full plate of fresh fruits and the mocktail coupon. Choices for breakfast was good with a omelette station. The major concern was the toilet. Towels looked tired. Water seeped out from the shower door. The bathroom floor and even door area outside bathroom was wet! The toilet seat was shaky.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,5,Great Service,"We stayed here on our only night in Casablanca and it exceeded our expectations. Check in was quick, room was very clean, bed was comfortable, they quickly brought me a hair dryer when I called and requested for one, and amazing location next to the mosque! We were able to leave our luggage at reception while we toured the city during the day. They do offer currency exchange but only US dollars but there’s so many banks nearby that can also exchange. The reception staff was helpful and called us a taxi to take us to the airport late at night. The cab ride is almost an hour long and is 350Dh from the hotel. Would stay here again.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,4,Can't beat the location!,"Situated at the doorstep of the major attraction of Casablanca (Hassan Mosque), this is a very good hotel with attached kitchenette. The staff are very friendly and room-service perfect. Food is decent and available 24x7.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,5,"Perfect location, Modern, Comfortable","Stayed here on 2/10/19 and it was the perfect hotel. Staff was extremely cordial and took very good care of us. Our suite was super large with a separate living room. It also came with a balcony that looks straight into the Hassan II mosque. The views were beyond amazing. Hotel seemed to have undergone a recent refurbishing and looked great. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a modern, comfortable place that is within walking distance to Hassan II mosque and the medina. Another plus was Rick's Cafe, Scala, and other hotspots are nearby.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,2,2 Star Rating...,"This hotel is only 2 star, Torn up old beat up towels, Very small almost 1.5meter X 1.5Meter or 6'x6' only washroom, If you weight more than 200lb you cannot take shower, very surprise that rooms are huge why small showers and washroom, no exaust it stinks, Water smells sulphur which is very nasty and dangerous, I mentioned all these problems to the Hotels senior management they done nothing other than smile....",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,3,Best view,"The location of this hotel is the best. From your veranda you can have the grandeur view of the mosque. The employee were very friendly and accommodating. Hotel is ok but not worth the price. The restaurant and breakfast is just ok, could be better",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,2,Inacceptable,"Positive things first: the location at the big Mosque is nice, some rooms have a good view ontologische the famous landmark. Unfortunately those more expensive rooms have inacceptably worn and dirty bathrooms. (can‘t judge the other rooms obviously) the shower/toilet was leaking, leaving a stinking puddle on the floor. Solution: service guy brought some parfume (no joke!) tv signal was quite bad, one bed-side outlet was broken, the doors difficult to open/close. The hotel obviously is in desperate need of an overhaul - until then it‘s by far not worth the money. In that regard it at least fits the city of Casablanca. Never again! :-(",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2019,3,Apartment Hotel,"To be perfectly honest if you are looking for something in casablanca I would suggest somewhere different. The room was OK, the bathroom small and quite dark, with insufficient lighting for my liking. You have to ask for clean towels they're not forthcoming if you leave yours on the floor of the bathroom. Breakfast was OK, other food choices were quite limited. No a la carte restaurant service and room service has only about 6 choices. I would suggest that if you stay you don't buy water or soft drinks from reception as they're extortionate. Far cheaper to use local shops which are about 75 % cheaper. Road noise was excessive even though I was on the fifth floor! No bureau de change facilities although advertised in reception they could not change £ sterling. Even the bank about…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2019,5,One night,"We booked it for our last night in Morocco because of destination, it is near Rick's caffe and mosk. Rooms are big and clean, staff is very nice and friendly. They print our's bording passes and call us a taxi in the morning.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2019,4,Nice place,"A Nice place to visit Casablanca. The view from our hotel room was good! See picture. The big mosk is just around the corner. Some details could be better (ironing the sheets, repair of toilet seat). The guarded parking basement is super convenient. Overall a good place to visit Casablanca.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2019,3,Walking distance to the Hassan II Mosque,"We booked the Melliber because it was our last night in Morocco and we wanted to be close to the Mosque for our 9am morning tour of the inside. I was pleasantly surprised at the hotel. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms were fine and there were facilities to cook. Also, the breakfast buffet had a nice variety as well as a omelette station. It was about 3 minutes walk to the Mosque which was awesome.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,4,"Fair price, fair place","Melliber is a good Apart Hotel. Despite the bathroom is very tide, the room is spacious and clean. All cooking itens and dishes of the apartment kitchen were clean and good. There is a breakfast buffet with a good variety of bread, pancakes and hot dishes, but don't expect care for details. The bed was very good and the hotel is very near the mosque. Casablanca is a difficult city for tourists. Stay at Melliber or at the hotels near Anfa Place. Avoid the hotels next to central area keeping security in mind. The hotel could renew worn bath towels.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2019,4,Great location for tourists,"Visiting as a tourist, I really appreciated this location. The hotel is very close to the Hassan II mosque. It is an easy walk to the ancient medina, and was very close to the modern downtown and lots of restaurants. The facilities are very clean and modern. It is nice to have a small kitchen with plates and flatware. We were able make breakfasts and a few lunches while we stayed there. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was small but adequate. I think it is a good bargain.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2019,4,"Great Hotel, low price!","I’m actually in the Hotel Right now! It’s really quite it’s my 2nd day and just booked one more day! All is clean, spacious has a kitchen and wc and shower are great! There’s a small gym (actually the smallest but working gym ever) I don’t think it can accommodates more than 2 couples max if the guys are working out the same muscles and the girls doing cardio. Staff are ok, some helpful. Parked my car in the underground parking. Rooms are sound proof & WiFi going great! This hotel although have less options than some other hotels, I find to compete with some 5* stars hotels around here and even better than some in Marrakech. However try to book the biggest rooms and go levels up.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,5,Amazing in front of the mosque,"The hotel is very nice! Big rooms with a small living room and a kitchen, very clean and comfortable room! The sofa is a very nice bed too. There isn't much to see and do around the hotel except for the mosque, that is footsteps away. The corniche is in renovation so it's is not a nice place to walk around because there is nothing to see. We also didn't find any restaurant nearby. We stayed there for one night, I don't believe you'll need more than that in casablanca anyway. The breakfast was not included in our tariff, and we made the mistake to pay for it at the hotel. Don't do it. Go anywhere else. There are not many options and the staff won't help you. I waited a long time for my eggs, the waiter gave it to another lady because she was complaining. And she asked for it…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2019,3,Not great,"Shower in my room is broken and the water trickles out of every where except the shower head, and the bathroom floor floods like crazy. Although my bed was surprisingly quite large, the sheets were dirty (pic attached). The large size of the bed though is not a constant throughout the rooms as I was with two other couples who’s beds were not quite as large as mine. Additionally, the bathroom door doesn’t even open the entire way because the toilet is in the way and it is a very tiny bathroom.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,3,"Decent hotel, 2 min walk from Hassan II Mosque","We stayed for one night. Pros: very close to Hassan II Mosque (totally worth going on a guided tour!!), cheaply priced at the last minute, nice sized room, free water bottles Cons: mattresses are very very firm, we arrived at 2pm and they would not accommodate an early check-in because check-in is at 3pm, cab from hotel to airport was $35 (when local cab drivers said it should cost $25)",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,Excellent Hotel and amazing staff!,"We visited Casablanca around the end of the year holiday time and stayed at this hotel. It was excellent, we got a room that was like an apartment with stove, microwave, dishes etc in case we wanted to make something. The room qas amazingly clean. Most of all we loved the aervice of the staff especially the Dity Manager Mohamed and Restaurant Manager Sophia. We were travelling to Marakech that night and the flight was arriving close to midnight. These two Managers went iut of their way and made sure we wouldnt be steanded when we got to Marakech. They made arrangements for a shuttle and must have spent over half an hour trying to locate the info on the shuttle. They also showed us routes to the markets, restaurants and the famous Hassan II Mosque. We thoroughly enjoyed…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,Great hotel with friendly staff,"As mentioned hotel is right next to Hassan Mosque the only game in town for sight seeing.

Bathroom was good shower a little small but OK. Had no problems with WIFI or anything else in hotel. Would happily stay again.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,Better in retrospect (of other Moroccan hotels),"Friendly and efficient Reception, spacious room, comfortable bed, excellent selection of English-language TV channels. Staff worked hard - but in vain - to arrange a car rental. Lifeless lobby, decent restaurant but pricey food. Great location: 200m to Hassan II mosque, 1 km from Rick's Cafe, 1.2km from Sqala restaurant, 2km from Casa Port train station. Quiet. Seemed overpriced, but after 10 days of touring we realised that it was the best of all.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,5,Excellent stay!,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 1 night and day prior to start of our trip in Morocco. The location was excellent, right next door to Hassan II mosque which is the main attraction in Casablanca. We had a view of the mosque from our room window and it was beautiful day and night! The hotel was clean. Room were big and modern. Buffet breakfast had a lot of variety which was a big plus. You can't bit the price that's for sure. We took a taxi to visit other parts of the city. What made the most dofference in our stay is the people at the front desk. They were super friendly, professional and quick to answer your every question even though they were very busy all the time with many people coming and going. They even recommend a great nail salon for me down the road and…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,3,Average hotel,"I stayed here solo for one night Pro - 5 mins walk to the mosque which is the only worth thing to see in Casablanca - spacious room - big bed - average breakfast Cons - basic necessities are missing in the room such as hair dryer, garbage bin, tissue box - small shower, very slow - all the water comes out from the pot upon boiling - elevator can only fit 3 people I will recommend to stay here just for one night for the mosque. Since the hotel is so closed to the mosque, you can walk to the mosque to see both day view and night view.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,5,"Fantastic location, comfy, great staff!","Not a 5 star hotel, but truly great stay. We arrived at 9am, exhausted, crazy traffic - hotel staff welcomed us at the car door and took luggage before we even opened the car door. Helped us get settled in the lobby quick. Check-in was a breeze, super friendly staff. Check in was not till 3pm - not only did they check us in right away at 10 but they also upgraded our room to the superior gold suite (we had booked gold suite). Cafe downstairs was great, very friendly and helpful staff all around the hotel. The room was very comfortable and huge! Separate bedroom, bathroom and living space (with a large pull out sofa), kitchen space with stove and a mini fridge. Would definitely recommend as it's also very central to a lot of local attractions. This particular suite (703) had city…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 November 2018,3,average hotel with a great location,stayed here one night. PROS: the reception staff upgraded us as they had empty rooms and accommodated my travel with me and my father. the location is very convenient to the mosque which is pretty much the only thing to see in Casablanca. didn't experience the breakfast so I can't comment on it but it looked decent for 6 euros. CONS: the room smelt like sewer the reception never had bills when I asked them to break a 200 dirham bill. the wifi was weak and kept going out there was only one elevator working and it is tight max 3 people can fit in. overall I would recommend staying here for only one night and don't go in with much high expectations.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,4,"Nice hotel, great location",Nice hotel and very close to Hassan II Mosque (just steps away!) - we could see it - and the ocean - from our hotel window. Staff were friendly and helpful. Buffet restaurant had a variety of options for breakfast but the cafe did not and was over-priced. We ended up getting breakfast from a nearby cafe,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,3,"Decent Hotel, Excellent Location Adjacent to Hassan II Mosque","This is a decent hotel and our room was fine.

Landing at 5 pm, it took us 2 hours in a taxi to reach this hotel driving through a ton of evening traffic.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,3,Not bad for a bit above average,"It’s a nice hotel with basic facilities. Staff are incredibly cheerful, friendly and helpful. However, when I first got there, check in is at 3pm but at 4.10 I was still waiting for a room to be ready which was annoying, disappointing and irritating as they need to bear in mind that some people actually spent quite a few hours travelling and are possibly tired! They did though, offer us a mint tea. I was a bit disappointed and shocked when I told the reception that my sidère in law will come to see me and if they could direct her (also said that she might bring her baby). They said no they don’t allow girls from casa to go up! I thought this was very belittling of them and quite derogatory! It gives such a bad opinion and image of girls from casa which is not nice st all! I…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2018,1,Horrible,"Stayed there with my friends for one night.

I'm writing this review while still staying at my comfortable double room in the 3rd floor . my fiance stayed here before and I can finally understand why he said it was his favorite hotel in Casablanca. The reception staff were all helpful and their smiles makes you feel welcomed. The cafe staff as well it's like everyone is happy to work there . that alone , was enough to feel the management is doing their job right . if you are reading this review to decide about staying here . I can assure you that you wont be disappointed. Thank you melliber hotel .",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2018,4,"Location, comfort. Higher floors have good view of Mosque","This is a good hotel for business or a couple night's stay. It is 1 block from the Hassan II Mosque which is definitely the highlight of the city. We were on the 5th floor and could see the top part of the mosque from our room. The hotel is also a 20 minute easy walk from the Medina. Other city attractions are farther away and require a taxi ride, but being on a main street, it is easy to find taxis around. We did not try the 6 euro breakfast, but we did have supper there. The food is good but don't expect a full big plate. Prices are slightly more expensive than a comparing restaurant, but it is very convenient. They do offer to set up a taxi to the airport for 350dh. We got offers from other cab drivers for 300dh.

 May 2018,4,Nice hotel that is very close to the Hassan II Mosque,"The hotel was lovely, large rooms with a comfortable bed, a decent shower and a small kitchen.

The restaurant downstairs is very nice too.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2018,4,Good hotel in a good location,"This is a solid three star hotel. My room on the sixth floor was spacious, with a view of the Hassan II Mosque. Every member of the staff was friendly and helpful, and there was a plate of fruit and cookies in my room when I checked in.The location was convenient, and there were always taxis outside the door if you wanted to venture further afield. On the downside, I only got clean towels when I asked for them, and there was a gap between the shower doo and the wall, so unless you angled the shower head very carefully, the floor got flooded. This room came with kitchenette; the refrigerator functioned well, I did not try the cooktop or microwave. There was plates and cup with two forks, two knives, and two spoons. There were not pans for the cooktop.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2018,4,Decent place for a couple nights.,"Hotel itself is clean and the room was big and comfortable. Staff were helpful and polite. Small fruit platter and bottled water waiting for us in the room on check in which was nice. Other than the big mosque next door there’s not alot to do in that neighbourhood, it’s probably the only downside to this hotel. The restaurant downstairs was convenient and reasonably priced. The breakfast buffet for €6 per person was actually decent for the money. Only negative thing is the location is a bit tricky to get to from the nearest train station. I walked the 2km from Casa Port station because having 20 cabbies yelling at me as soon as we exited the station turned me off taking a taxi.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

The beds were ridiculously comfortable and the shower was great! The kitchen wasn't very well-appointed though, so cooking was next to impossible. The included breakfast was good and plentiful. After traveling around northern Morocco for a week, we had already become accustomed to the wonderful Moroccan hospitality. The main downside to staying in a large hotel is that you don't experience that. We loved the location of the hotel - especially its proximity to the coast and the Hassan II Mosque.

Taxis are always close by however other points of interest are a 15 minute walk away.

The rooms are great if you have a silver room I don’t know about standard rooms . I wouldn’t stay here again . I was refused read bags at the reception by a young lady then asked me 20dhs (£1.50) for a tea bag. We had a car so it was ok for us travelling wise .

We did find that there are not really good restaurants within reasonable walking distance so we ended up at the restaurant in the hotel and we had an excellent and most enjoyable meal there. For Westerners just bear in mind there is no alcohol served because of its proximity to the Mosque. Breakfast in the morning was also very good.

I was looking forward to stay at this hotel with my family on our final night in Morocco. We arrived early and as per hotel norms, we had to wait till check in time to get our room. We got our room about half an hour earlier than the check in time. We got a room on the second floor which sadly had a lot of flies (around 5 flies). This is the first time for me to experience such a situation in a hotel room. The receptionist managed to give us a room on the 5th floor only after my husband insisted that we need to change the room since we have a baby. The second room we had was much better since it had no flies. However cleanliness can be further improved. The room itself was big, however the toilet was very…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2018,4,"Great value, good location","The staff is really friendly, polite and helpful with great customer service, which is not always custom in Morocco! We received an upgrade to a Silver suite with an amazing view of the Hassan II Mosque. The room was a good size. Large queen bed with small tables and chairs for eating, a desk, and two chairs to watch TV. Nice size balcony, but really not private. Kitchenette is well equipped. The bathroom door was broken and when we closed the door, we got stuck in the bathroom. It was OK as we were 2 people. Should a single person have closed the door, he would have been in major trouble! We let the staff know and hopefully they will fix it! Free indoor parking which is really great for Casablanca. I would stay there again for sure!",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,4,Nice and good value,"Our hotel room was large, clean, and comfortable. The staff were friendly and the restaurant was good (though empty aside from us at dinner). There is underground parking and the hotel is very close to the Hassan II Mosque, though a long walk from much of anything else in the city. The only negative I would note is that some of the common areas of the hotel appear unfinished or in slightly poor repair. Overall, a good value.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2018,1,Not as I expected,"First of all, we came early and I understand that I cannot take my room until 3 pm. I had a plan, I went for early lunch and came back around 2:38 pm and the receptionist gave us our room. The room was on the 2nd floor. I asked for a higher level room away from the street because I have a baby and he said that it was not possible. Then, we found that the room has a lot of flies. More than 4 flies in the room. I took my luggage and went down to him and I told him I have a baby and the room is full of flies and I’ll never take this room. We waited for almost an hour and we took another room on the 5th floor. The 5th floor room had no flies but it was dirty and not maintained well. The view was awful and the bathroom was so tight.

If we come to Casablanca again we will stay in this hotel for sure.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2018,5,Great Hotel Close to Hassan II Mosque,"From the outside, you can tell this was to be an apartment or condominium complex. It was never intended to be a hotel. They have done a nice job of making the entrance comfortable; but no lobby (to speak of). Staff speaks many languages and they do it well. They are very attentive and seek to correct any oversight. We had booked two twin beds. They gave us a room with a king bed and sofa-sleeper. No issues. they made up the sofa-bed for us and it was comfortable. The room was a bit stuffy; as the A/C is okay; but low in capacity. TV/Internet all great; no complaints. Our room had a nice view of the Hassan II Mosque; which was beautiful by night. Breakfast buffet was fine and plentiful; for any palate.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

My review is based on these two days.It was cold outside (10 degrees Celsius). first day Was given a room on third floor, where the hot water, telephone and the sink in the wash basin wasn't working; had to physically go to the reception and complain The issues were attended to immediately and rectified. Overall a clean room incl clean linen and bathroom. Though note that the bathroom shower facility is rather small and gives v less space to manoeuvre. The pressure in the shower and basin is good.

We were traveling from the US with our 10 year old, so were thankful for a warm welcome and delicious dinner. The room was one of the nicest we stayed in during our 15 days in the country and you could see the mosque from our patio. Breakfast the next morning was delicious with a ton of options. Getting to the mosque was an easy walk so that we were able to beat the crowds there in the morning. Add to it, everyone was super friendly.

I had no idea how close it was to the Hassan II Mosque, it’s literally next door! Thankfully I was able to check in a little early with no additional fees. The staff was very friendly, welcoming and helped me out with questions I had about the area Including where to eat and what to do. I felt right at home here, especially being a single woman traveling alone I felt very safe. The food in the hotel restaurant is amazing, I had beef Couscous which was delicious among other things.

Close also to grocery stores and butcher shops. The hotel also has a fine restaurant. The suite we chose had great sea and mosque views. The suite also had a fully functional kitchen. The only minor recommendation would be to have a few pots/pans/utensils in the suites. The staff is friendly and helpful and there 24/7. Overall excellent.

 February 2018,4,Close to the Hassan II Mosque,"The Melliber Apart Hotel is just a few minutes’ walk to the mosque, which is a must see, but not too close to other things a tourist might want to see. More important, the prices are reasonable, the hotel staff is friendly and helpful, the sleeping area (but not the bathroom) is large, the rooms are quiet, the internet access is excellent, and the breakfast is very good. One piece of advice. There is often a taxi driver who is parked opposite the entrance to the hotel. He may have an arrangement with the hotel. I wanted to go to Casa Voyageurs train station. He said it would be 70 dirhams, but I was able to return to the hotel from the station for only 40 dirhams. The next day I wanted to get a taxi to Habous.

Driss, one of the staff in particular was extremely helpful. He helped me find a taxi to the airport and helped me communicate with one of the taxi drivers to take me to the Morrocan mall and Airport for an affordable price. He even found my charger that I left behind after going to the airport. This was much appreciated. Food in the restaurant for both dinner and breakfast was delicious. I suggest you ask for the Morrocan tea, you will love it! Now to the bad, customer service on the phone sucks! They hang up on you and never answer. Perhaps its an outside source.

The staff made my transition easy for me. I was really appreciative of the treatment I received at both ends of my short stay. I was looking for inexpensive, given the very short utilitarian stay.

 February 2018,3,Very worn,"We stayed one night here and one night was enough. First the good things: Front desk staff was very nice and friendly and the breakfast was good. The negative: We had a room on the 2nd floor and it was so worn and felt dirty. We had to wait for our room for almost an hour so we missed our tour to the Hassan Mosque. The room was old and worn, had a little kitchenette that look like it had not been used or cleaned for a while.

It was not prayer time when we arrived, so in the morning we just walked there for morning prayer. That was very charming. Staff was polite and rooms were clean.

Great location - walking distance to Grand Mosque, banks, restaurant and so on 2. Central heat/ac - I went during winter and unlike most places in Morocco who don't have heating inside the house, this was a pleasant surprise. I was comfortable. 3. The staff was amazingly nice and helpful. Willing to accommodate my needs and assisted in hailing a taxi to the train station. 4. They left complimentary bottle water, fruits and a piece of cake and a note in my room for me :). Great way to win me by providing food. 5. The food served at the restaurant was yummy :).

 November 2017,4,Comfortable Stay close to Hassan II & Rick's Cafe,"Casablanca holds little interest for tourists aside from the beautiful Hassan II mosque and Rick's Cafe, well known for it's connection with the movie Casablanca. This hotel is walking distance from both. We arrived here straight from the airport on arriving in Morocco from India. It was 145pm, and as our room was not yet ready, we left our luggage at the lobby and went to the Hassan II for the 2pm tourist visit. The mosque is just around the corner from the hotel. There is also a bank and atm just down the road from the hotel. The hotel staff speak French and some working English, but it's enough to get by on.

 November 2017,5,Great hotel close to the Hassan II mosque,We chose this hotel because we only stayed one night in Casablanca before our flight out and only wanted to see the Hassan II mosque. We chose this hotel because it was the closest. What a good surprise! We were upgraded and got a large room. Spotlessly clean. Everything was great including the service and the free on site parking.

In particular, we really liked the artistic photographs of the different views of Casablanca, as the large one behind our huge and really comfortable bed. Reception desk is very kind and available and the breakfast is really excellent. We loved the atmosphere just in front of the Moschea which we could actually see from our private patio and listen to all the calls. It is in an excellent position, very near to the sea and the port and we used the private parking. Our swuite didn't have a very big or renewed bathroom and WIFI connection was spotty.

The view of the mosque from our private terrace (we stayed in a Luxury God suite---worth paying little extra for the view and extra space) and beautiful evening breeze were fabulous. We would have loved to have a pool here after our long trans-continental flights. The bathroom was very small for a ""Gold Luxury Suite"", and wifi was poor (unfortunately, not unusual for Morocco).

There are two point to highlight. First cleanness of the Hotel, there is a humidity smell everywhere, especially inside closets. Second the parking; the entrance/exit is a nightmare experience: the slope is very high and it is for two floors, and the parking structure layout is very narrow to drive inside. The staff is helpful, especially security staff are really gentle comparing to the international standard. Make sure you get the right room in the reservation.

To start, the room was nothing like the photos that are posted online. Seemed like the room hadn't been cleaned in couple months. Dusty floors, sheets, towels, and kitchen counter, to say the least. The room was half the size of its online description. Do not expect to find any pots/pans/utensils in the kitchen. Worst of all, the front desk receptionist was rude and curt. When I went down to make sure we got the right room (gold superior suite), because I was convinced that we were mistakenly given a inferior room by mistake, he kept insisting that we got the best room in the hotel and was unwilling to make amends for the sub-par room…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,2,Ok for a 1 nighter if you can stand/ignore discourteous STAFF,"The best part of the hotel is its location, few minutes walk to the Hassan II Mosque and Rick's Cafe which is possibly the only reason to visit Casablanca. The room is very spacious as it is designed as an apartment/hotel and the beds are comfortable + it has a cafe/restaurant on site. But that all positive about the hotel ends there. We had a few problems in the room including the bathroom sink not draining, room electricity shuts down every time we used the kettle to heat water, key cards not working and no included breakfast with the steep price of the hotel. We were on the second level with a huge terrace with the view of the Mosque's tower but it does not have any chairs to relax unlike the rooms on the first level. Bathroom has no division from the toilet and is not very…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,4,Eco-friendly hotel,"Very good hotel with clean, spacious rooms, great breakfast, perfect location, helpful staff, safe underground parking, and if you are lucky, one of the best views in Casablanca. What really surprised me though was the eco-friendly attitude.. On the down side, even if its not the hotel's fault, the area is not the safest in the world so be carefull with your belongings. Seriously...its a weird city. Otherwise, enjoy your stay at this hotel, its worth it!",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,2,Great Location,"For the most part our experience was ok as the property was located in a very convenient location and was clean with friendly staff members, depending on who you deal with. While reviewing my itinerary during my layover in Cairo I noticed the hotel offered airport shuttle service. I called the hotel at 4am to ask if I could reserve a shuttle for my arrival at 2pm and while the man that answered the phone was able to communicate with me, I felt is english was not strong enough as he didn't seem to understand me in full so I asked another Moroccan passenger also waiting to please translate. When disconnecting the call the man that translated for me advised me that that the hotel informed him that they would not be able to send a shuttle to the airport for my arrival that day since…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,5,Great team and place,I spent 2 days at this hotel . Late check-in . Very Good location near the sea and the mosque.Nice breakfast .Good price around 65 euros for a big room . Professional team I Will certainly come back .,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,4,Melliber Restaurant stands out,"Overall, this is a nice, spacious hotel, well located with an outstanding restaurant – highly recommended for dinner. The hotel is quite new, and some of the growing pains are showing – customer experience is an uneven, depending on whom you are dealing with, although the staff is generally friendly. For example, children on the floor above us were moving furniture to the point that we felt that construction work was being done. When we asked at the reception that something be done to reduce the noise, the two employees smirked and let us understand that we’d have to live with it. We waited for the shift change and returned to complain again, this time Mamadou took appropriate measures and made it possible for us to enjoy the rest of our stay. We had the same experience at the…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,4,Nice hotel with a great view of the mosque!,"Very nice hotel. Our room had a magnificent view of the mosque, which was only a couple blocks away. When we arrived around 9:30 pm, we were exhausted and hungry. There was a very nice gentleman at the desk who was very helpful to us. His name was Idriss. I would like to say 'kudos' to him for giving us excellent customer service! The only caution that I would have is that they don't offer washcloths for showering. If you are like me and require one, you might be wise to take your own.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,1,"Good location, clean rooms but theft at check out","No doubt Melliber has a great location overlooking the Hassan II Mosque. The rooms were neat, tidy and spacious. The lifts are a pain though. Very slow. It takes forever to press the electronic button and lift finally arrived at your floor after at least a 5 minute wait. Staff seemed helpful and friendly at first. But at checkout, tricked us into paying 100 dhs more than we were supposed to. Morocco is full of people looking to rip you off so be cautious. We weren't expecting the same from hotel staff but from our visit here at Melliber, it seems they are at it as well.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,4,A Goood Value Stay,"This apart hotel is very good value. It has many positive points; it is very clean, has free parking, easy to find, new, fresh and modern. If you have a car then many things are an easy drive away though parking in Casablanca is a bit of a nightmare. We had a silver apartment and had a lovely outside patio area to sit in which was really worth the extra cost. There is also a nice cafe attached to the hotel. The downside is there are not many restaurants within walking distance, though there are some. The staff, while not rude are not particularly friendly. This was a surprise given our experience of Moroccans in general. Also I would not recommend trying to check in before 3pm as you will just be told your room is not ready and have to wait. Overall though it was a good stay.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,4,Right Near the Hassan II Mosque,"It's a Fresh & Clean property, approx 500 meters from the mosque. - The wifi was very slow. - The hotel is slightly outside the happening area, you would need a taxi to reach the nearest decent restaurant.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,3,Everything is nice except a disgusting staff,"We've stayed here for a night when we visited Casablanca. Fortunately, the facilities and everything are really nice. However, the staff at reception and I suppose his name is Mustapha(I got this name from his colleague), was extremely rude. He always showed unfriendly face and was never looking at our faces. We could completely feel that his speaking was full of impatience. When we asked him what is the biggest shopping mall in Morocco and where is it, his answer was: I will tell you tomorrow. How come this guy is the person who provides services to customers. Again, everything is nice except this guy.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,1,WARNING theft at hotel even though next to mosque,"We came to stay at this hotel on our way to Marrakesh for our wedding in March 2017, and we were horrified to find out that at the hotel that someone had stolen $2,500 US dollars from our luggage. We had to bring cash to pay vendors for our wedding, which made us uncomfortable so we took extra precautions. These must be very professional thieves, because we were only gone from the room for 3 hours, and the luggage was locked with a combination and we had the money in a side pocket. The door was locked with a electronic card, so workers in the hotel have access to the room. We only found out that the money was gone when we got to Marrakesh. When we called the hotel, they gave us the run around. They wouldn't answer our phone. It took us a lot of effort to get a hold of a…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2017,3,Hmmmm....,We booked the Melliber Appart Hotel for our transitions through Casablanca on our recent trip to Morocco. Both times we arrived in the early evening and then departed by 8:00 am. The rooms are spacious (as depicted) and clean but I cannot say that I loved the hotel. It was sufficient for what we needed and I might book it again but not with great enthusiasm. The bathrooms are really small and have zero counter or shelf space for your toiletries. The floor was not an appealing option so I went with the kitchen counter outside the bathroom. There is also no hairdryer in some rooms (others have the style that is attached to the wall). When I called to request a hair dryer the gentleman told me he might be able to find me one. It felt like I was asking for a lot more than a…,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,4,Wide and Clean Rooms,"Rooms are wide and clean. Staff is very nice, especially the restaurant staff. Location is not that good as I was there for business. But it's not far away neither. 7-8 mins by taxi which will cost around 2 USD at most. Breakfasts were the best of the same range hotels in town. Overall, it's good and affordable.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,3,Casablanca hotel near Hassan II Mosque,"The hotel is in a nice location, and is well decorated. The environmental sustainability efforts were very good. Unfortunately our room was not in a very good state of repair. The shower leaked very significantly when used to the point where the bathroom would flood during a 5 minute shower. There was significant patching work done on the bathroom floors and walls. There was a kitchenette in the room, but there was only one plate and two glasses provided - no cutlery or cooking utensils. The carpets in the hallway were also quite dirty. Hotel staff was pleasant, but the front desk service was very slow.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 March 2017,1,They just don't care,"This hotel is very close the the Hassan II Mosque and that is the reason we chose it. Otherwise there is really nothing positive about our experience here. The parkade has ridiculously steep ramp, so severe that I was worried we would bottom out the van driving in and out. The staff are professional but impersonal and made no effort to see if a room with a view of the ocean or Mosque was available despite our request. We had two rooms. One with a broken bathroom door handle and the second with non-functioning air-conditioning and a broken shower fixture. When we reported this to the desk at check out, no apologies were made. Further more there were no attempts to record the information so that repairs could be made for the next guest. Really apathetic towards everything…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 February 2017,4,Comfortable Yet Affordable Hotel Near the Mosque,"The room is very comfy and the amenities great. The only couple of downsides; slow wifi (almost to the point of being useless) and the fact that it's a dry hotel — no bars/restaurants serving anywhere near. But the hotel seems to cater mostly to Moroccans so for many, it may not be an issue. A bit far away for most things except the mosque and the Medina. Service can be spotty.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2017,3,Modern & location,"What I like about this hotel is the design of the hotel, the rooms are spacious & modernistic. Location is great, it locates near Hassan the Second Mosque & Casa Corniche. The staff were nice specially the receptionist. Although we arrive around 5 pm, our room was so dirty & missy so we called them to clean it.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 January 2017,5,Perfect gem,This a perfect hotel for long or short stays. 100 meters from the mosque if that's your thing. Hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. Wifi is fast. There is street noise but I think that is normal for being in the middle of the city. The floors are also a little this. I could hear the person above me dragging a chair across the floor but that's all I heard.,MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,5,Great hotel,"I stayed part of my trip in melliber and really enjoyed it. Great location, great staff, smart rooms and a lovely breakfast. Highly recommend this hotel.

 December 2016,5,"Modern, comfortable and very friendly staff","Outstanding friendly and professional staff, nice spacious and modern rooms, neat private parking. Rich and tasty breakfast! Location superb for us - close to ocean! We got helpful advice on how to approach the evening downtown. Wi-fi a bit weak at floor 2 where we stayed.",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,5,Amazing location and staff!!,"You really can not beat the location of this hotel. This was the first hotel we stayed at for our Moroccan vacation and we received such a warm welcome from the staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful here!!!! It was a beautiful introduction to the friendly Moroccan people :) Also, there is a gated garage parking lot under the building which is safe and convenient! Definitely recommend this hotel for those wishing to be close to the water and the spectacular mosque. ***check out the picture, taken from the balcony of our hotel room :)",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,5,Location can't be beat,"Relatively new modern appart hotel just a walk away from the famous mosque and the sea. Service : The staff are very pleasant . Mr Laurent (manager I think) answered all my questions and helped in anyway he could . If you require anything during your stay or if you feel like you need something that isn't in your room ( cutlery , iron , kettle , laundry services etc) just ask and they immediately make sure your request is fulfilled. Rooms : we stayed in the Silver studio which had a queen bed and an additional sofa bed . Very thoughtfully furnished and comfortable but pillows were too firm for me. Room has a kitchenette with a two burner stove, sink and microwave . Room did have a safe. Bathrooms : very clean with a shower enclosure and no tub . Could use a ledge near the…",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2016,5,Great Hotel,"I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. The staff was great in particula Rachid at reception was extremely helpful, he even gave me free breakfast for the complete duration of my stay. Easy parking with lots of spaces always available. All the main attractions are close by and the Hassan II is very close an a beautiful place to visit. Try thier omellete bar as I found it to be amazing. Have a great stay in Morocco and try this new hotel. *****",MELLIBER_Appart_Hotel-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
