 January 2023,5,A Palace in the Medina,"According to our guides, Palais Zahia was once an actual palace, it's not just a name. Fortunately for us, we found Palais Zahia and booked rooms. What a treat. Though the hotel is really nice, the staff were the best; they made us feel like royalty.",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2022,5,A jewel in the medina,"The hoel is a short walk up a slopping alley into the medina, and walking in the fist impression of the attrium / courtyard is extraordinary. The detail, the diversity of materials and artisry.. it's breathtaking. With a tea and cookie welcome, you are introduced to the friendly and helpful staff, wh took excellent care of us. The rooftop terrace is another view into the medina and the surrounding area. The room was similarly impressive, and our night there comfortable. Breakfast the next day was extensive, and we were attended to by Samir, who was a serice-focused standout. This is an excellent place to base for both walks through the medina and the area by the bay and the surrounding hills. Very impressive.",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2022,5,Authentic morroccan experience,"An incredible taste of Morocco here at Palais Zahia near the Grand Mosque.

 November 2022,4,Authentic Morocco Cuisine,"First of all the place is designed so soulfully, that the moment you enter the restaurant area, you fall in love with it. and then the staff are super polite and smart. We saw just two waiters who were super efficiently moving around taking orders, serving food, taking pics of clients, clearing table, billing, etc. The food was just too too good and authentic in taste and texture. A must visit.",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2022,4,"Great staff, great food, great decor. Great experience Love it",I would have given this 5 stars except our room was a little small and not a lot of area to store our luggage. The staff were amazing and worth 6 stars! The cook even started work half an hour early so we could have an early dinner. They took exceptional care of our group. The food was excellent and the decor was exquisite. I loved staying here. Thank you for an amazing experience.,Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2022,4,"Nice and well located hotel, poor half board experience","This hotel is placed in an excellent location, right at the centre of the Petit Soco in the Medina. Attractions are very close and you can walk everywhere ( we arrived by train and where picked up, but arriving by car might be tricky as it is located on a Medina street). The hotel is colourfully decorated and rooms are ample, clean and have all required toiletries. The terrace has a great view of the port and the Medina top. Breakfast is buffet, plentiful and with good variety ( scrambled eggs, cereal, several types of breads and pastries, jams, honey, butter, cheese and fruit). Service was very good, particularly Samir who is always checking on you to ensure you have everything you need.

 August 2022,5,Fantastic hotel service and ambiance,"This riad was very lovely and beautiful. The workers there were hospitable and showed us all the locations we should hit. rooms were comfy, we got upgraded to a suite for free because of an issue in the other room we had booked. The only thing i’d say is this is right in the medina, which is a little hard to get to with luggage, cars driving in the medina is wild. we did it, but we got them to pick us up. i’d recommend asking them pick you up instead of taking a cab.",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 May 2022,1,Not recomended,"I stayed at the hotel about a month ago. It is important to note that the hotel is in the center of the cMedina, so taxis or cars cannot get to it, which means you will have to carry your luggage by yourself. The hotel is built in like Riyadh, and in the evening there is loud music at dinner, which lasts at least until 22:00 so if you want to go to bed early, forget about it .... I forgot a bunch of keys in the room. When I got to my house I contacted the hotel and they told me they had found the keys. I asked to have them sent to me and I will pay for the expense (4 keys). I was told that they contacted HDL who told them they were not sending keys ... When I inquired with HDL, they told me it was a lie, and there was no problem sending keys. Until now I have not received my…",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

I have traveled to over 50 countries and never stayed in a place that messed up my reservation like this one. it literally says “balcony” in the reservation, which I paid extra for. Not only did it not have a balcony (a blatant lie), but they first took me to a (incorrect) room that had two twin beds. I researched so much for this trip with my bf - no way in hell I would’ve chosen a place with two twin beds. I told them they are wrong and they denied it. They then took me to a second incorrect room until they realized and admitted they took me to a second incorrect room. All this being said, I still have not been reimbursed whatsoever for paying more for a room with a balcony that didn’t exist.

 October 2019,5,Our nicest surprise!,"My wife Monica and I just completed our two month trip of a lifetime. Zurich, the Alps, Italy, Spain, France. On a lark we decided to visit Tangier for six days. Palais Zahia was available. Lena, Drees, Labardi, Mohktar, Abdullah, and the rest of the staff whose names escape me made it by far the most surprising, the most memorable, the most pleasing, the most you name it week of all our travels! We felt like we were leaving close family members when our time came to its end.",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2019,5,Amazing experience in Tangier,"Palais Zahia is a hotel located in the heart of Medina (old town). They have only 18 rooms, so the atmosphere is very family like, peaceful and intimate. It is beautifully and traditionally decorated, the food is amazing and the staff is very friendly, welcoming and professIonal.

 October 2019,4,Good riad in the medina,The hotel is on the Little Socco which may have historical significance but isn’t really interesting nowadays. It has a few cafes not really for tourists but for the local fauna. It is right in the medina so close to all sites. Easy access from the main place across the port. The riad is richly decorated. Rooms vary in size but are comfortable and clean. Bed are firm but comfortable. The restaurant serves good food but not fine dining. The rooftop terrasse is very pleasant at sunrise and sunset! There is a learning kitchen so groups can have cooking classes.,Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,5,Wonderful!,This is a fantastic hotel. The staff is very accommodating and hospitable. You feel welcomed the moment you walk in the door. The accommodations are very well-maintained.

 October 2019,5,Immersive and welcoming.,"Amazing place and comfortable room. Great place with amazing hospitality. We were offered things to do and recommendations. We were just on foot and walked around locally . This was our first trip to Morrocco and found if we walked into this place and turned around and left that this would be enough experience.

 October 2019,5,Joe Haden,"Fantastic place, we enjoyed staying in the Sultans Suite. A beautiful room and the ceiling was spectacular, all hand painted and detail on top of detail. The building was recently remodeled for 8 years from multiple shops into a beautiful hotel. Everything was gorgeous, great lobby and restaurant area on the first floor. An elevator took us up to the roof top restaurant and lounging area with great views of the port and street in the Médina. The staff arranged a free guide but we got busy, lost in our own exploring and missed our arranged time. This hotel is easy to find and in the center of the Médina.

 August 2019,5,Excellent location but the staff make it.,"This is a cracking hotel. We booked the Eugène Delacroix suite which is beautiful. Very comfortable bed, lovely decor and a good sized bathroom. It overlooks the medina so they have double glazed it to help with the hustle and bustle. If you’re a very light sleeper, ask for a different room would be my advice. The roof terrace is gorgeous with amazing views. What makes this five star in my mind are the staff who are, without exception, superb. Friendly, helpful, engaging and filled with hospitality. My sincere thanks to them for a beautiful stay.",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 August 2019,4,Loved it....,Fantastic location - right in the souk - so you'd think it would be really loud - but it wasn't. Breakfast was varied and tasty. Staff was very nice. We actually had a family room/suite....two bedrooms off of the entry way wtih a shared bathroom - plus a toilet. The one bad thing was that the door came off our shower (literally) And there was nothing they could do to fix it. But we were still able to shower without totally flooding the bathroom.

One of the entry gates into the Medina is within walking distance from the Palais. We were received with mint tea, appreciated, and general information about the area and available tours. Included with our stay was a “free” guide that walked us through the Medina the day we arrived. He was very knowledgeable and engaging. Meanwhile, the service at the hotel was excellent. One of their employees, Yusuf, was eager to help us out or answer questions. For instance, I needed to go to a currency exchange and he accompanied me.

 May 2019,2,Try to find another Riad,"Palais Zahia tries hard but falls short. The hotel rooms do not have adequate lighting and are musty. The showers do not work properly. The maid service does not always happen, the air conditioning does not work properly, and the food is just adequate. The interior courtyard, however, is very attractive. The staff tries to help their guests, particularly Yosef, who is outstanding.

 May 2019,5,Great customer service,"We had booked a room at this hotel for an overnight stay in tangier. Much to our disappointment, the port at Tarifa was closed the day we planned to travel, so we never made it. I wanted to review, though, based on all the correspondence with the hotel in answering all our questions about hiring a local guide and arranging a porter to pick us up at the port. The hotel was always timely and courteous in their correspondence. When I called to cancel the booking, they were understanding and hoped to see us on another visit.

We were welcomed with heart and efficiency by every staff member ~ from Anis to Youseff, Amina, and the hotel's wonderful driver Abdullah and his kind co-pilots on both journeys to and from Fez. Everyone I mentioned made our happiness their goal and that is what they delivered! The wait staff for both dinner and breakfast were wonderfully attentive and warm. Every night there was a talented oud player who serenaded the dinner guests and anyone else lucky enough to be within earshot.

 April 2019,5,Beautiful hotel with great service,"We stayed here for two nights. From the moment of arrival the hospitality was a five star experience. After making my reservation the hotel emailed me in advance to find out if we needed airport transfers, excursions or bookings for dinner or spa appointments. We took the high speed train from Rabat and I wasn't sure of the arrival time in advance, so I emailed them from the train and they were able to have a driver pick us up with only 1 hour notice. We were served mint tea upon checkin and then planned an excursion to Cap Spartel for the afternoon.

We were served mint tea as we were checked in. Yusef gave us a history if the hotel which started as a bank. It has been redone in a beautiful Moroccan motif. Our room was very nice, comfortable bed and attached bath. Dinner was included with our room and it was very good. The staff is all very professional. Two small complaints, our room was on the side facing an alley where some locals were chatting it up loudly until 4am. Schools were on holiday so I suspect this is why they were up so late.

Would recommend for a family or a business trip. Great food, amenities. One of the staff, Yusef, made our trip a success with solid recommendations for food and tile.

 March 2019,5,Wonderful Hotel!,"What a neat place to stay. The hotel and staff were very welcoming. The ambiance is exactly what we were looking for - old world feel meets modern luxury. We stayed in on of the suites. Plenty of space, windows opened, bed very comfortable, plenty of pillows, bathroom amenities and rain shower head, mini bar and water was included. You could hear some of the noise from the ally with the windows closed but it did not lessen our sleep. Breakfast was good and the staff opened a little early for us because we were leaving before it officially started. We walked the streets that evening.

 November 2018,5,Amazing gem in the Medina,"The service here was impeccable. They arranged taxis, tours and a hammam, which was so relaxing and an experience everyone should do. The rooms were comfortable and the shower had good hot water and water pressure. The breakfast was traditional and filling and the coffee was great.

Youssaf made us feel comfortable and safe at the beautiful riadl and in the medina and the recommended tour guide, Majid, became our soul-friend. We only spent a few hours together but we learned so much about the city, saw a lot of places and were comfortable and free to ask questions and have genuine conversations, sharing and learning about the culture.

 October 2018,2,Too noisy,"Cons - hotel transfer did not pick us up from the port as organised prior and we were ignored when we told them of this. - room was VERY noisy from street noise, call to prayer, guitar player in downstairs restaurant who while was nice while having dinner, continued to play up until 11pm or so. They do not have thick or double glazed windows which is needed. - took a private tour of the city organised through the hotel. It started off great, but then we were ushered into a carpet shop towards the end where even though it was ‘no obligation’ to buy, our guide left us where we sat down and the rug shop owner proceeded to splay our rug after rug trying for us to view. In the end we had to stop him, say we were not interested at all in buying a rug. The tour then upruptly ended…",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2018,4,Outstanding service and property but room for improvement,"We booked 2 suites for single use which were unusually small yet nicely decorated. So is the brandly new refurbished property which offers outstanding service. However, for the price we paid, one would have expected a licenced restaurant, or a restaurant where you could bring your own wine. Unfortunately, neither was possible due to the owner's idiosyncracies. We had to drink hiding inside our bedrooms -totally unacceptable. In the same way, access is difficult as the property is within the Medina and we had to walk up quite a bit before reaching the hotel. Those 2 elements somewhat spoilt our experience: we needed to eat outside the hotel instead of enjoying the great view from the terrace and decided to cancel our next stay planned a few days later. What a shame that the…",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

We decided on Palais Zahia because all the reviews on Trip Advisor were very positive. They were so right! On our request we were picked up at Tangier Airport by a very courteous driver arranged by the hotel. As soon as we arrived at the property, a very polite concierge greeted us and led us to the front desk to register. We were welcomed with almond cookies and mint tea, while the required information was being taken. Then we were given a tour of the property which is absolutely beautiful everywhere you look, from the lobby-eating area to the rooftop lounges, with the scent of orange blossom everywhere.

I can’t wait until the next time I visit the beautiful city and country of Morocco.,Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 April 2018,5,Fantastic stay in the Medina,"My family and I spent 3 nights in Palais Zahia and truly had one of the best travel experiences in Tanger thanks to the amazing accommodations and phenomenal staff at the hotel. This hotel (originally a bank from early 1900s) underwent a huge renovation and the final result is stunning. The terrace has breathtaking views of Tangier and I am sure it’s amazing in the Spring and Summer. From the moment we arrived to our departure, the staff at the hotel made us feel at home and went above and beyond to personalize our trip. Abdul did a terrific job driving us around town. Amina was very kind and ensured we had all of our trips booked with the best prices. Yakoht is one of the most friendly hotel managers and made sure we were being well taken care of during the whole stay. Youssef…",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 March 2018,5,Just Wonderful,"Nice experience when we found my friends an I this great ""palace"" in my home town. It's a quite place to visit for dinner or lunch or even just to take a green Moroccan tea. The rooms that we visited are so nice especially the Sultan Suit. Ask for the nice and wonderful Youssef who will give you all the details about this ancient Bank of State of Morocco in the early 1920's. I'll certainly go back to discover the place by night and also to take a drink on the roof under the white light of Tangier.",Palais_Zahia-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
