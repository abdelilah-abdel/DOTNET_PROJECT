 February 2020,5,Delightful stay and excellent customer service,We were arriving on the bullet train from Casablanca so I emailed Dar Jameel and Tal responded that he would arrange for a taxi to pick us up at the train station. I cannot emphasize how good it felt to be met at the train station by a smiling face and taken straight to the front door of the riad - which is in a quiet part of the old medina and might be difficult to find on your own if you are new to Tangier like we were. (After a day in Tangier we could find Dar Jameel easily because it is right near the Hotel Continental.) The last thing I wanted to do after being on a plane all night and then navigating the train stations was to haggle with a taxi driver in a language I do not speak. We even caught an earlier train and Tal was still able to have a taxi meet us - the response…,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2020,5,Excellent value friendly guesthouse,"I took the Bergache room (see my photos) on the ground floor and the staff brought my breakfast tray to my room on the ground floor as I could not climb up 3 flights to the terrace! Excellent abundant breakfast with homemade jams. Comfortable bed. Delightful manager Abed was kind and helpful, as was Zack. English owned. My room was rather dark due to a broken bulb? Chilly in winter but there was an efficient heater and constant hot water. Excellent shower. Stayed 1 week. Highly recommended. Hard to find! Abed helped me with my luggage.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2019,4,"Beautiful environment, late breakfast","We loved the beauty of Dar Jameel. It's located through a door in a small alley in the midst of the medina. Once inside, you are surrounded by beautiful tilework and lovely rooms. We stayed for one night in August, and although the weather was warm, the small A/C unit in the room kept us comfortable. Note that it did drip some water, so we were happy we hadn't put any clothing right underneath it. Breakfast was served a little later than most places we've stayed, about 8:30 AM; since we had an early tour scheduled, we only had time to quickly grab something. Just be aware of the timing so you can plan your day accordingly. The location in the midst of the medina was nice, letting us take some time to explore the nearby streets,",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2019,4,Avoid ground floor rooms at all costs,Tiny rooms with no outside windows creating a really stuffy atmosphere. To get any air one can open a window onto the lobby area of the Riad but then noise can be an issue and I would not have felt safe leaving window open all night. No air con although a fan provided. On the plus side rooms on the second/third floor are brilliant so as with everything in life you get what you pay for. Breakfast served on the top floor was decent enough and the very best thing about the Riad was Abed on reception. Communicated with him prior to arrival about getting there from the bus station and he sent a taxi to meet us. Also offered us a room move for our last night as they had availability. Top top man!!!,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,5,"Very friendly, helpful staff.","Very friendly, helpful staff. Beautiful interior, comfortable rooms and great views from the terrace.

 September 2019,5,Cozy and comfortable Riad in Tangier,"I would 10/10 highly recommend Dar Jameel to anyone traveling to Tangier. The hotel was lovely, only 8 or so rooms, so you get to know the property intimately. When I arrived, the hotel had arranged a taxi to pick me up from the hotel and transported me to the hotel. The entrance is in the heart of the Medina (old, walled part of the city) and it located in a tunneled archway. When I was there, there was sewer/construction work outside, so I didn't get to adequately appreciate the entrance, but those anxieties were calmed when I opened the door (after knocking and being let in by the front desk). The atrium is stunning, with an interior courtyard opening up to the outside. The tile work on the interior was marvelous, and the staff were friendly. Everyone spoke impeccable English…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2019,1,The worst experience in my Morocco trip,"Actually We’ve booked 2 nights here, after first night we decided to change another hotel on the next day. First, after we checked-in, our room was on 3rd floor, and no lift in the Dar, we have 3 big heavy luggage but no staffs help us at all and we need to carry our own luggage all the way up the stairs to 3rd floor ourselves. The dar decoration is nice and also have a good rooftop with nice view but inside the building was very dark, especially our room. Even turned on all the lights is still very dark, the washroom is even more worst. When I woke up in the morning I saw water puddle on the floor, lucky that all our luggage wasn’t at that area. My family and I was totally disappointed.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 July 2019,5,Best place to stay in the Medina. Love Love Love,We were so surprised by this hotel and the quality of the rooms for being in the middle of the medina. We were a family of 5 and were given a room with 2 queen beds and a small sofa that met all our needs. The staff were top notch speaking excellent english explaining the main areas to explore in the city within walking distance and some excellent advice regarding places to eat and shop. the Mint tea served by the staff on the rooftop when we arrived was a great introduction to Morocco culture and the whole family from 7 yrs old to mom and dad enjoyed it. We only spent 24 hours there. one night then back to Spain but it was worth the experience to be on the african continent and see a very different culture from Spain / Portugal .,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 July 2019,5,Nice hotel with a beautiful view near the harbor,a highly recommended hotel inside the medina the view is the most beautiful of the hotel and its proximity to the port You can get there and go up in the first entrance where the canyons are.

 May 2019,5,Beautiful unique hotel with helpful staff and good breakfast,"When I walked in the door of this place my jaw dropped! It was amazing! It feels like Morocco. It is located in the Medina and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else. The rooms were clean and fully decorated, the location was safe, the staff super friendly and helpful (not only did they help arrange a taxi for us the next day, but also they emailed me in advance with easy to follow walking directions to the place from the ferry dock). We are a family of four so we got two rooms. We were given a tour upon arrival (there is an awesome balcony to hang out on). Breakfast was fruit, pastries, breads, and hot pancake like things. I highly recommend this place! I will be back!!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2019,5,Beautiful Dar,"We stayed for 1 night as a group of 6 . The Riad/ Dar is beautifully tiled through out, plenty of photo opportunities. Staff were very friendly and helpful.

Would recommend!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2019,5,Fabulous,We had a wonderful stay. The location is great and very central. The hotel is beautiful and our bed was comfortable. All the staff we extremely helpful and pleasant in manner. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble and they organised a taxi to take us to Ceuta when we left and confirmed the price. The breakfast is excellent. The views from the roof terrace were spectacular. We had a picnic dinner their one night when we needed a break from the hustle of the medina.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2019,5,A great place with fantastic staff,"This hotel was clean and looked beautiful and the staff (particularly Abid) could not have been nicer and gave us tips and recommendations for restaurants, activities and means of transport within our budget that made our trip much more enjoyable. In particular they matched us with another couple travelling to a nearby city to spread the costs of but not sacrifice convenience. The breakfast that was provided was delicious - a buffet of fresh pastries, fruit and traditional breads. The roof top terrace was a lovely place to sit and relax after a long journey",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2018,5,"Beautiful Riad. Kind, helpful staff. Stunning rooftop terrace views. I must return!","Jaded and wired after a days journey of bus, train and ferry travel from Granada, Spain; I arrived at the port of Tangier Ville:. From the ferry port, look up and you will see the Hotel Continental's giant sign: Dar Jameel is to the left, and behind that hotel. You can easiily walk the ten minutes it takes to get to Dar Jameel, if you have wheeled luggage. Walk even if you have a backpack. Skip the taxi, unless you have a steamer trunk.. Dar Jameel is something out of 1001 Arabian Nights. It is exquisite. In the USA a place this nice would cost $250 a night easy. It is a three or four story historic riad building with a fantastic rooftop terrace, and a rooftop enclosed reading room ( which is great if it is chilly and, you want to gaze at the port's…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2019,4,"Lovely, but rooms vary","Excellent hotel, lovely roof deck and goo service. Well located as well - and we could drive up to the door with our cab (rather than than have to walk a far distance in the medina with our bags.)

Worked for one night but would not work for more.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2019,5,Beautiful Riad in the tanger medina,"My room and bath were beautiful and the roof deck has an amazing view. Breakfast was great. They arranged for a driver to pick me up at the airport and a guide to take me around the medina. I was fortunate enough to have Mohsein for a day. He is knowledgeable about all things Moroccan, passionate about his roots in the medina and has a great sense of humor. They even got my phone working properly- the best hosts ever. It was my first day in Morocco and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. Louise M.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 March 2019,5,In the Tangier Medina at Dar Jameel,"We stayed at Dar Jameel for a week, and had a wonderful stay. The staff was so helpful with everything - getting a taxi, getting directions... It helped that they were multi-lingual, of course. The place is beautiful! Tile and elaborately painted wood. The breakfast array was great - I loved having fresh feta with the crepes... The hotel was in the medina, but close enough to the edge that we easily found our way around - this is more important than you might imagine! In short - great people, beautiful place, great value.

I was on a 3 day road trip, driving hours each day, with a guy i didn’t know and i felt comfortable, he was professional but always felt like an old friend. We stopped in countless villages for snacks or WC or sightseeing. The accomodations and food at the camp were excellent and guys at the camp were great - it was like a fun family night.

It's an easy walk from the ferry port (although we did take a few wrong turns on the way!). We arrived mid-morning so our room wasn't ready but the young guy on duty showed us up to the roof terrace (which has spectacular views of the old town and the modern promenade and port area) and brought us some mint tea while we waited. Our room was 'Tafraout' up two flights of stairs - it might not sound much but they were definitely a tough challenge especially after a day exploring the sights of Tangier. The bed was really comfy with soft pillows (exactly how I like them!). On our second night there was a wedding…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Extremely nice and helpful staff that took our heavy luggage up to second floor. Changed leftover Dirham to hotel payment which was convenient since we were leaving for Spain. Nice breakfast with really good strong coffee, fresh fruit, yogurt, and breads. Bathroom was nice with nice sized shower.

They prepared us a babycrib in our room since we were traveling with our 5 month old daughter and we even had our own waterboiler (and sterilized water) to make her milk in the early morning.

They offer a good breaksfast with some moroccan food. Our room “Leila” was big enough and cozy, with nice views through the window to Tangier’s bay. Just a little bit cold in the bathroom.

Our favourite place to sit was on the rooftop at night where we could soak in the amazing views and enjoy the peace and quiet far above the busy streets. Our room was on the third floor which was handy for breakfast in the morning. The Riad had steep stairs which could be a problem for people with mobility issues but there are rooms available on the ground floor.

Breakfast is served on third floor up some very steep stairs with high risers. However, we were offered to have breakfast brought down to us. Typical Moroccan breakfast with variety of pastries.

Very friendly staff and clean rooms and comfy beds. the breakfast was great and dont even get me started on the night time views from the upper terrace, those alone were worth it to me. the only reason i wouldn't give it a full 5 stars the lack of AC, and that can definitely be a deal breaker for some.. i visited Morocco during the hottest months of the year and coming from marrakech i never once found the lack of AC as a major problem due to the cool, breezy design of the residence, however , I could definitely see some coming from cooler climates being bothered by it. either way, a charming experience that was well worth the price.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Imagine my surprise and extreme disappointment when the front desk guy casually told us that AC is not functioning:(. Not only that, he didn't even make an attempt to get it fixed. Let's talk about cleanliness, the hotel is dirty and bug infested. Beds are hard. We got better service in the village of Chefchouen in Lina Ryad.

Upon our late night arrival, the gentleman at the front desk kindly upgraded our room to a larger one for no additional cost. The place on a whole is absolutely gorgeous, everything is very ornate. The room was clean and had every amenity we needed (except soap in the bathroom, but we had our own). The rooftop is the best part, can’t recommend enough!

I cant think of any other hotel where I have even taken photos of the ceilings! The climb to the upper rooms is steep but worth it for the views over the medina and across the strait. The staff were all courteous and helpful, and thankfully willing to carry luggage up and down the stairs. The breakfast provided was fine. Outside the labyrinth-like passages of the Medina may seem intimidating but they are fun to explore, yes you will get lost but the size of the Medina means that you will always find your way out again.

This was particularly special as little did they know we were celebrating her 78th birthday! It was a great breakfast. I read reviews about people not liking the beds, but ours was comfortable and the room and hotel in general were beautiful.

 November 2017,5,Enjoyable stay,"Spent several nights at this hotel. It is quite beautiful inside and everything was enjoyable and the hosts were very hospitable. They helped me navigate the city and recommended some activities and sights. A few things to note, as per several other reviews, this hotel is hard to find and you may have to pay someone to help you. I found Tangier was moderately difficult to navigate with just a map, but I made do. The medina is not big and you get pretty well oriented after a couple of days. The other thing is that there are a lot of neighborhood kids and they are very noisy. Apparently one of them got ahold of a whistle and that was his favorite toy and went at it until the early morning hours. Not the hotel's fault, but it's something to consider if you are a light…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Comes with 2 king size bed, a small round table and sofa. It was spacious and generous. One thing though, the floors were tiles so it was very very cold during the our visit. (It’s winter and rainy) Bathroom - nothing to shout about, but there was sufficient hot water and it is clean. That’s good enough on my books Hosts - I don’t remember their names, but they were kind and helpful. 10/10 would come back again.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2017,5,Perfectly located small riad in the medina,"Da Jameel is a lovely courtyard house in the Medina of Tangier. The bedrooms are interesting , most back on to the centre of the house but the higher rooms with a view are well worth it . Well appointed rooms, not luxurious but very good for the price. Stefan (the owner) is a great source of information , his staff less so but very pleasant. Breakfast is good but not magnificent. The house is on the edge of the Medina so easy to get to. Waking distance from the boat from Tarifa. The best thing to do in the Medina is set off and wander without looking at the map too often. It is not threatening and there is lots to look at and lots to buy. Don't miss the Kasbar at the top .

DAR JAMEEL is the best place to stay in old city called Medina. Everything is within walking distance.The staff was very friendly and helpful.Day duty nice guy named Habib was very helpful for us. He told us very informative things about Tangier and its surroundings. Habib helped us to book a very nice Taxi driver named Abdul Aziz for a half day trip to 3 different places including Hercules Cave at a very good price. I am very thankful to Habib the staff of the hotel who gave us a very nice local thing as a present. Breakfast was basic.There are not too many things in it. No any type of egg also. They have to improve it with some type of other items.…,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2017,5,Wonderful Stay,We liked this place so much we stayed 2 nights. It's located in the medina and a little hard to find but worth the effort if you don't mind walking with your stuff and being harassed by touts beginning in the parking lot. The rooms are beautiful and the staff is great. It's in a great location to explore the medina and near some nice places to eat.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2017,5,"an oasis in the chaos of the Medina,","the Medina can be overwhelming at first, settling into Dar Jamel was amazing and made our 2 day stay in Tangiers memorable. Fairly easy to find and a quick walk from the port. The rooms were unique, very clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Used the staff at hotel to recommend a driver for half a day tour beyond Tangiers..loved it , The common room on the top of the building was a great place to relax, watch and listen to the sounds of Tangiers .Loved that Dar Jamel was located within the Medina, close enough to walk and explore everything within Medina Would not hesitate to recommend if willing to immerse yourself into Tangiers.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2017,5,Medina - mishaps - memories & Muhammed,We were only 2 days in Tangiers but they felt like a week and full of memories. Tal the owner was good in our correspondence prior to arriving - I even twisted his arm to book my Tangiers to Marrakech train ticket. Tal also agreed for a taxi pick up From the boat ( 5 persons over 67 years - trying to find our way in the Medina)- this went smoothly. The Riad is beautiful and cozy and the staff especially Abdil & Querish Went out of their way to man our stay short but sweet. We learnt around 4pm that our train Trip to Marrakech was cancelled - Abdil was on his bike to cancel the tickets and find us place on the Bus - great work . They also allowed us to stay for a few extra hours in our room - without trying to gouge us of any payment - in fact they offered us some treats &…,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2017,3,Nice and charming Dar in the heart of the medina,"Good breakfast, big room with comfy bed, new ville and medina easy to reach... Wifi was not available in the rooms, only in common area. Description of rooms should therefore be modified so that guests won't expect Wifi in rooms. Some dead cockroaches were found on floor in the room, cleaning should be done more accurately. Payment with credit card was not possible since the credit card reading device was not working. We tried with three different credit cards. Staff was not helpful. Credit cards were used some minutes later at ATM and all three of them worked out fine.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2017,5,"authentic genuine, the real deal in the Medina.,",we stayed 2 nights at the Dar Jameel and had a very pleasant experience. the staff was super friendly and accommodating to one of us who have limited mobility and couldnt climb the stairs to the breakfast room.They brought it to his room !! The hotel itself is superb with its Morrish tiles and mosaics. Truly a treat to see. Our rooms where just fine. Everything clean and tidy. The welcome mint tea was so appreciated and delish.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,5,Gorgeous dar in the medina.,Gorgeous dar in the medina. I must say it was a bit difficult to find. We had a local show us the way for a small tip. Truly a hidden gem once you get inside; the colors and architecture are breathtaking! Stayed with my wife on our honeymoon in the Shehrazade Double Room - loved it! The staff was super accommodating and attentive to all our needs. The breakfast was excellent and probably the best we had in Morocco.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,4,Beautiful place in old Medina,"Pros: The people here were incredibly helpful and accommodating. I ended up having to change our reservation very last minute when lost luggage kept us in Marrakesh longer than anticipated. Dar Jameel was helpful and understanding, and even moved us to a larger room for the same price since the room I had originally booked wasn't available for the night we ended up needing. The room was HUGE and the place overall was beautifully decorated/traditional Riad style. The roof deck and breakfast rooms were stunning! Cons: This place is in the old Medina and while the location is GREAT if you want to spend your time wandering around the old medina/markets, it can be confusing and you are likely to get hassled trying to get from the main Medina gate to the hotel the first time you make…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2017,5,An oasis in the middle of Medina :-),"Luckily we booked at Dar Jameel. Warm welcomed with nice tea. Had a family room, quite big with two queen size and a corner sofa. Nice decorated with poster beds and detailed ceiling. and a special bathroom. Good working aircondition and totally quiet. The breakfast was surprisingly bigger than expected and very tasty. This hundred years old former family house, now Guest House was just beautiful. Once behind the big front door, you stepped into an oasis. All the outside noise and hustle, just disappeared. Beautiful colours and a lot of details inside, all the mosaic, the stairs and so on. The roof terrace was a welcoming place to be. Overlooking the Medina an Tangier.

 August 2017,5,Beautiful hotel in the Medina,"Our two nights stay in Dar Jameel was very good! I would definitely stay here again. The location is great for exploring Tanger and the Medina, and very convenient if arriving/leaving by the ferry to Tarifa, Spain. The staff are very helpful and the rooms are beautifully decorated. But the lower rooms (on the ground floor and the floor above), does not have AC or windows apart from into the court yard. Both noisy and warm, in other words.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2017,5,Peaceful Sanctuary in the heart of the Medina,"We have just returned from a week at this beautiful, authentically Moroccan guest house. Location is excellent - well worth getting the Ferry from Tarifa (rather than Algeciras) to Tangier as this takes you to the port which is a just few minutes walk from Dar Jameel. On entering Dar Jameel we were struck by the beautiful decor and architecture - all the rooms are based around a central courtyard in the traditional way which keeps it cool. The rooms were clean, comfortable and air conditioned which was much appreciated in the heat. The view from the roof terrace is also spectacular, over Tangier bay and the beautiful Medina rooftops. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, and went out of their way to make sure everything was okay. Breakfast is served each morning…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2017,5,Great visit and incredible staff,"Family of three (two teenagers) just loved our stay at Dar Jameel. Arrived tired and only half impressed with Dar Jameel, but every moment got better and better and better. Spent 3 nights in total. Architecture is beautiful; staff were the best we experienced in Morocco; and location was very quiet. Few pointers to help other travelers: - initially difficult to find. Many people will try to 'help' you. Recommend to get good walking directions as most taxis can only drop off about 100-150 meters away. Once find there are easy ways to return. - downstairs rooms don't have air conditioning. It was warm During our visit (88F/31C) but fan kept us cool. - breakfast is continental variety with breads. - as always in Morocco demand the taxi drivers use the meters (just last night…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2017,5,THE place to stay in the Medina,"A delightful, atmospheric and comfortable hotel, in the perfect situation: an easy stroll from the ferry port and in the heart of the intriguing old city. Very beautiful inside, and a magically cool and peaceful retreat from the heat and bustle of the Medina. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in when travelling. The staff could not be more helpful, generous and kind. Breakfast is served in the rooftop dining room with magnificent views of the port, curving strand and everyone else's rooftops! - and consists of delicious locally backed breads, fruit, soft cheese and excellent coffee. Can fully recommend this romantic idyll.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2017,5,Gateway to Morocco,"Best introduction to Morocco. We get off the Tarifa/Tangier Ferry and a few streets later we are inside this magical and colorful Riad where the staff show us to our spacious rooms. The rooftop patio gives us a birds eye view of the Medina wall and rooftops and the Beach near by. The next morning we were leaving for a 4 day tour, but the Staff had an early breakfast prepared for us... such great hospitality.. There are no elevators but staff are very helpful with the luggage.. Thank you.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2017,4,Lovely hotel in the heart of old city,"Dar Jameel is a beautiful jewel box of a hotel in the heart of the city. There is nothing inauthentic about the hotel or the people who work there. They are kind, helpful and go out of their way to please. We had the family room for our two kids and us. It consisted of two large beds and two smaller twin beds. Perfect size. The room had working a/c, coffee and tea maker. They have a lovely rooftop area to eat breakfast and view the city. Would super recommend if you are willing to get out of your comfort zone of a modern western hotel. Small drawbacks- dense beds mattresses. There were divets in there that had us rolling! The buffet is nice but not amazing as some people report. 4 types of bread, jams and butter, yogurt cups and fruit. Not being ungrateful- just reporting…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2017,4,Great experience,This is a cute little hotel in the heart of the Medina (old town). It felt very authentically Moroccan and the staff was very nice and over accommodating.

 May 2017,5,Warm staff and beautiful setting,"I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience at Dar Jameel. The staff were above and beyond friendly; they treat you like family. One evening a staff member walked with us after their shift to show us a good dinner spot; the morning we left the hotel to return home, we departed before breakfast, so they packed us a to-go breakfast to take to the airport, and had a cab waiting for us at 5 in the morning. The hotel is beautiful and the people are friendly; its a win-win.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 May 2017,4,A Great Place,"The location was great. Welcome tea was offered immediately upon arrival. It had a roof terrace which was devine. The cost was reasonable for what you got. Nice breakfast. The staff were friendly, helpful and thoughtful. The room was authentic and charming. The decor throughout was thoughtful.

 April 2017,4,Convenient 15mins walk to port - close to entrance of old medina,"If you're driving to this hotel, make sure you know where you're going before you park because there will be hustlers who will try to be helpful and take your luggage through the old medina in circles to confuse you like in any old Medina. We learned the hard way! There's some public parking by the Hotel Continental and you walk towards the entrance of the medina. The medina wall will be on your right side and just walk along it until you see an open space with some car space on the left with some steps down, you'll see the place. Ouadie at the reception was there to greet us and translate to the hustlers that we no longer needed their services as they've already taken too much money from us. He kindly led us to the top floor where we were greeted by a very sunny and cosy room.…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2017,4,A great place to stay in the Old Medina.,"A great place to stay in the Old Medina.

The breakfast is modest, but it is not a hotel after all.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2017,2,Disappointing room,We had the room opposite the reception desk on the ground floor. It had no outside windows and smelled of damp. It was very noisy. The bathroom was only separated from the double bed by a curtain offering little privacy. The first morning we run out of hot water after a couple of minutes and had to content ourselves with a cold shower. Breakfast was fine. The riad is conveniently located within the Medina.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2017,5,Great stay in the heart of the old medina,"We had a wonderful stay in Dar Jameel, a small challenge to find but like anywhere in the old medina really!

The terrace was a great spot away from it all to relax while hearing the evening prayer echo around the medina.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2017,5,Our best stay on a 3 week trip,"Dar Jameel was fabulous. The customer service was superb, with staff recommending a great local restaurant.

 April 2016,5,Oasis of calm in a port of storm,"We stayed here back in January 2016 at early part of a year on the road. Amidst the chaos that is the Tangier medina, we found Dar Jameel to be a perfect point of calm. The building itself is beautiful, the vibe is chill, the breakfast amazing, the view wonderful and our host could not have been more helpful, even going out to buy our bus ticket to Chefchaouen. We loved it so much we almost stayed overnight in Tangier on our return just to experience it again.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2017,4,Great stay!,"My friends and I really enjoyed our stay at Dar Jameel. The riad itself is beautiful, and a welcome oasis in Tangier.

 March 2017,5,"Dar Jameel GH, a real gem in Tangier!","I was fortunate to have found Dar Jameel Guest House in Tangier, Morocco! It's located just inside the medina (old city) so it is easy to get to when arriving by taxi but also close to the center of things.

 January 2017,3,Adequate but nothing to write home about,"The Dar offers great views of the city and self-served breakfast is quite tasty, but that is about it. The beds are not comfortable and the plumbing is not always reliable. At the time we were there, none of the staff were that friendly and did not go out of their way to ensure we had a good stay.

 January 2017,5,Have you ever reviewed a hotel you DIDNT stay at?,I'm about to do something I haven't done before in reviewing a hotel that I didn't get to stay at. Just to start I should say I met part of the team from Dar Jameel on the ferry from Spain and as we talked I think they could tell I was going to be in over my head when I arrived in Tangier for the first time. The thing is my only pair of shoes broke on me and I needed to have them repaired or I'd need to buy a new pair while on the road. Neither a good option while backpacking. Insisting I jump in the can they had waiting when we arrived and leading me to the Dar Jameel located within sight of the arriving ferry we arrived at the hotel within moments and I was directed to have a local fix my shoes while they allowed me to find my accommodations on their Wifi I contemplated…,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2017,4,Refuge from the busy Medina,"A nice place to stay although a little rustic but it's Morocco! Initially we had a ground floor room just off the reception area but found it very dark so we asked if they had a room upstairs with a window - which they did so we changed with no extra cost. It suited us better as our eyesight isn't as sharp as it use to be. Breakfast was quite adequate with Moroccan pancakes, variety of toppings, pastries, cake, strawberries, bananas, mandarins tea coffee and yogurt. Part of the room was partitioned off with plywood or similar to make the bathroom and the shapes cut out of the wood made it not very private. The mattress was quite dense (no innersprings here) but quite comfortable nether the less. The owners and staff were helpful and friendly which made our stay lovely.

 December 2016,5,"Excellent staff, best place to stay","We arrived from the Tangier old port just around the corner from Dar Jameel. It seems daunting as you arrive, what with touts insisting on bringing you there and being unfamiliar with a somewhay chaotic city. But don't be disheartened! We found the place just fine with some help from a local, but we were lucky as he was not solicitous or aggressive in anyway. Consult google maps beforehand just to have an idea. In case you don't find such one nice chap: from the port, cross over to the Dar Dbagh gate, walk up straight and turn right, passing by a mural wall, then the Grand Mosque on your left, passing by the terrace on your right, enter Rue Beni Arross just near Rif Kebdani restaurant, then turn right, until you see a small carpark with steps, facing opposite that is the street…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The roof terrace offers great views of Tangier and it was a nice spot to have breakfast.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2016,4,Nice people in the central medina location,"A very moroccan feeling place hidden inside of a dead-end street in the medina. Despite its charm and very kind personell, don't expect luxuries. It has style, it has a feeling but it is more a budget B&B with splendid views, than a hotel. The bathrooms are simply worn-out and cheap, the rooms very a little better. Don't expect ""rich"" breakfast as many booking sites claim. Simple and decent breakfast with a coffee, breads, and only few fruits and vegetables. It is a nice budget stylish place for those who want to stay in a clean and decent place within the Medina. Amazing rooftop terrace, but be aware that the steps are plentiful and are pretty steep!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2016,4,Kind & Honest,"I stayed there 2 days. Because the first night I came too late, I made the room so mess, throw my stuff everywhere in room. But the next days I came back to hotel and found they not only make the bed, clean bathroom and garbage bin, but helped me to tidy my stuff like hang my own towel and clothes, clean and put my food storage box on the table which I left it in sink for cleaning. Also, I did left a coin (10 Dh) on the floor, and when I back to room, the coin was still there, nobody touched it. So appreciate their honest. The second night was 'super moon' night, I went to rooftop for the moon, the staff helped me to open the rooftop room and gave me some tea for warm. It was so kind.

The staff were friendly and provided us with a breakfast to go for our early departure. Too bad we could not enjoy the breakfast on the terrace. The riad is very nicely decorated and our room on the ground floor was spacious. The bathroom was located outside of the room but it was big as well. The only negative is the room and especially the bathroom is very humid.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2016,4,Charming place,"We stayed there for 3 nights and were very satisfied.The location is great as it is inside the Medina and just a short walk away from the most interesting sights. If you take a taxi from the airport ( which costs 15 euros) you will find the riad just behind The Continental Hotel. The staff at the riad are extremely helpful and informative.We were able to book 2 day tours from the hotel. An excellent breakfast is served on the upstairs terrace. This riad would not be suitable for people with limited mobility as there are a lot of stairs to get to the rooms and terrace. However, when ( not if ) we return to Tangier we will stay there again.It is not a 5 star property but its charm and very pleasant staff make it the ideal place to stay.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The staff very personable, and generally made me feel comfortable, even when i spent some days largely in my room. The place was clean, including bathroom & the bed comfortable but as with Any Riad you have to accept a degree of less privacy, but at the same time i felt safe & felt that my possessions were safe. Very rare for any accommodation in the region, the room included a jug & complentary tea & coffee (brought my own tea & coffee and only place on trip i had a jug - thank you).

The breakfast was good and plentiful, and delicious fresh orange juice. There were several roof tops, one after another, and on the top one, you could sit and have a quiet moment with some old records and good books, that were already provided. Amazing view over the harbour. Location great, in the middle of the old medina, but tough to reach by car, as the road was narrow, curvy and high up. Secret hidden gem in the midst of a busy city!

As someone who worked on award winning Architectural projects throughout my career I was bowled over by the intricate plasterwork and traditional patterned tiling. The hotel is worth a visit to Morocco in it's own right. The staff were wonderfully warm and welcoming without being in the slightest way invasive.

The area can feel quite busy and the streets narrow, but once you arrive at the calm and expanse of Dar Jameel, you at once feel relaxed and can enjoy your stay, knowing you don't have to walk far to get back into it all when you want. The panormanic views from the roof terrace further accentuate this feeing, and many an evening I was able to work from the terrace and enjoy the ambience of the area fro above. The sunrise is also especially beautiful from up there. …",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2016,5,Great place to stay,"Great location, beautiful room, quiet at night. Helpful staff. Right in the Medina but still in a quiet spot. The atmosphere in this hotel was purely Moroccan but with modern amenities. Highly recommend.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2016,4,Good location easy reach from the ferry landing,"Arrive early enough to ask for a room at the top with a view of the harbor. Good breakfast (served on the top floor). Can be walked from or to the passenger ferry to Spain. Use the stairway to the old Continental Hotel and then the steps to the left as you face the Continental Hotel. Then a short walk, about 100 feet on the right of Rue Mhd. Bergach (within but on the upper edge of the Medina).",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2016,3,"Nice hotel overall, but hard to find staff","The hotel is beautifully decorated. It is located in the Medina, bit hard to find, but located a bit higher than other buildings, so you can see a good view from the rooftop. Breakfast is okay. Staffs are nice and willing to help. The reception helped us with the bus timetable. The only problem is that it's hard to find the staff there. The reception desk is often empty. Also they lock the front door so you need the staff to open it from inside. When I came back at night I rang the beIl, called the hotel, but no one answered. I had to phone my aunt in the room to go downstairs and open the front door.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2016,4,The real Tangier,"This hotel is located in the Medina part of the city - where the locals live and not in the more expensive beach-front area. You won't find it easily so take a taxi which will only be able to drop you off near to the hotel - about 100 metres or so from it - as the hotel is in a narrow street inaccessible to vehicles. We usually stay in more expensive hotels but this was a real find. The rooms are lovely, the staff are helpful and the breakfast was great. The cost was amazingly cheap and I would thoroughly recommend it. BUT watch out - as always in Morocco - for the 'guides'. When we got out of the taxi on arrival, we were approached by someone who said he worked at the hotel - he didn't - and offered to help us with our bags and act as a guide. In the end, he was…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2016,5,What an experience - and a wonderful welcome.,"We stayed over night after getting the ferry from Algeciras. (Word of warning, this does not take you to Tangier City, but to Tangier Med which is 40km east and you will have to get a taxi which is about a 45 min drive away, or a public bus or train.) We were shown through the very narrow streets of the old town (kasbah) thankfully as we would have struggled to find our way even with sat nav. We did get lost that evening during the wonderful Medina evening market, ending up in the same place after 20 minutes, but it was fun and we felt safe. We eventually gave in and used our downloaded sat nav from Trip Advisor. The hotel Dar Jameel is a delight. Wonderful to stay in a place of history. The decor is traditional and worth staying just to view it. The room was lovely and clean…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2016,1,No food service... no kitchen.. accused of being rude!!,"The hotel offers no food service, therefore we assumed using the kitchen next to the room (unlocked, no private signs) was no problem. Today we go to the door and there is a sign saying employees only. We went to ask about this, as if there is no lunch of dinner service, or fridge in the room, if we are expected to go out to eat for all our meals (expensive!!!)... the man working said we could not use it and the manager put this note and we couldn't speak to him until tomorrow. When saying if it was OK to make something small he said no and we should have asked, I tried to apologise for not asking, and explain as there were no signs against using it and in our well travelled experience it is customary that if there is no food service there is a usable kitchen and he still…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2016,4,Good hotel but can be hard to find if you're new to Tangier,"My wife and I had never been to Tangier or Morocco before. Although the hotel is not far from the Ferry terminal, it could be hard to find through the confusing alleyways of the old Medina of Tangier. And like much of Tangier and the port, there is a gauntlet of people trying to sell you all manner of goods and services. We found Dar Jameel to be our oasis from the hectic noise and pressure of the Medina streets. The entire place is meant to look like an old Moroccan palace or opulent home. There is natural light that comes from the central atrium and skylight - but that becomes more diffused and therefore darker as you get to the ground level. We were on the second floor so it sometimes was a bit dark. Our room was clean and decorated in the classic arabic manner with tile and…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2016,5,very nice riad in the old medina,"we stayed here for 3 nights in a double room with a bathroom. we had a vey pleasant stay, as the staff was very helpful and nice! :) everything that we wanted or needed (hair dryer, cab) was made possible in a short time. the breakfast was very tasty and home made! great way to start our Moroccan holiday :)",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2016,2,"Dar Jameel refuses service to unmarried couples & in a rude, discriminatory manner","A little difficult to find, but up the side of the medina. Very pretty small riad. Read the reviews and booked in advance. I explained there were two persons and that I wanted a double AND I WAS CHARGED FOR IT via booking.com Arrived after a long walk and long ride on the train with my male companion. They absolutely refused service. It seems that unmarried Moroccan women and men cannot take a hotel together unless they produce a marriage license. But two men together no problem; and they do not question couples who both look European. I am not Moroccan, so in theory, my foreign passport should have meant the transaction was ok. What I really didn't appreciate was the tone of the staff - scolding, embarrassing, implying we were breaking all the country's morals ... and…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2016,5,Excellent location; very beautiful and excellent staff and excellent service,We just spent a week in Dar Jameel and every day we were so appreciative to the great stay in this hotel.

The staff are fantastic people and extremely helpful and made our experience a great one.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2016,5,Good place to stay in Tangier medina,"Dar Jameel is a good choice in Tangier. The people running the Dar are very helpful and kind. We had a room on the first floor which was nicely decorated, and it had a small couch in addition to the double bed. The entire room and bathroom were decorated with beautiful tilework. The room also had a heating/air conditioning unit. There was a nice shower, plenty of hot water, and large, thick bath towels. There is a nice rack for hanging clothes. One negative is the very dim lighting in the room and especially in the bathroom. Breakfast is served on an upper floor in a very pleasant room or on the terrace. Breakfast was a generous selection of Moroccan breads and pancakes, as well as cereals, juice, fruit, yogurt and other items. We enjoyed our days at Dar Jameel and…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Rooms and common areas spotless.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2016,1,Dark,"Very disappointed after reading glowing reviews on this site. The decor looks like someone went completely OTT with the Moroccan theme but because of the confined space and darkness it can not be appreciated. We had a ground floor room opening onto the foyer, not good as my husband is claustrophobic plus it was incredibly dark. There were three ceiling lights of which one wasn't working, a small bedside light with exposed wiring and a very feeble bathroom light. When my husband mentioned he'd received a shock from the bedside light it was greeted with smiles. Very narrow room with overly large modern four poster, covered in dirty netting, leaving so little space either side you needed to turn sideways and there was only room for one bedside table. The toilet was not bolted…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2016,5,Beautiful little gem,"We really enjoyed the place. So very beautiful. Clean, comfortable, quiet, good breakfast. Helpful staff. Good bathroom.

 May 2016,5,Delightful!,"I stayed here for three nights and had a wonderful experience.

It's a beautifully restored Dar, with a terrific roof top patio and above that, a lovely, ""lookout"" lounge with comfy sofas, music, soft lighting and fantastic views of the waterfront. My room was spacious, clean and very comfortable, with private bath. Nice breakfast in the morning in a delightful, sun-flooded dining room, or take your meal outside and enjoy the views and fresh air.

 April 2016,4,Excellent,"We loved this riad and the location was great. It's absolutely beautiful inside. The stairs in any riad in Morocco can be difficult to navigate and this is no exception. However it's worth it and the rooftop is phenomenal. Breakfast was just ok. The man who works the night shift is not very friendly or terribly helpful. He acts as though you are bothering him for the smallest request. However, the man during the day is lively as is the rest of the staff. We would stay here again.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Nice buffet breakfast with good coffee, people who stay here seem to be all nice, overall simply a good vibe. I would suggest getting new towels, along with some uniformity in sizing them. Some of the towels come in like bath sheets, some quite a bit smaller, and I hate sneaking up into the closet for larger, more manly sizing...also, some are coarser that loofah's, an investment in new towels would be smart, that, along with some research on small bars of soap that actually suds up.

It’s a “traditionally” decorated suite with a double bed and lovely bathroom. The riad serves a nice breakfast with breads, jams, olives, cheese and fresh orange juice. There’s always tea in the lobby area. Dar Jameel’s highlight is an impressive terrace, partly open with seats and partly closed off with a sound system + couches. Very quiet and peaceful, the highlight of our Tangier trip.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2016,5,Wonderful and welcoming,"I was a solo female traveler and I couldn't have picked a better hotel. Dar Jameel was clean and inviting, the staff was pleasant and helpful. Location couldn't be better, right tin the medina overlooking the old port. It was a 5 minute walk to the casbah and an 8 minute walk to Place du Avril 9.

The staff was so helpful and the breakfasts (that were included) were amazing, enough to last until dinner. Great location just a few minutes walk from the ferry although you will probably need a guide, the streets will take a little getting used to! Our guide was Salah Abdi , he was a fountain of information about the movies filmed in Tangier. Would definitely recommend Dar Jameel.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 December 2015,4,Beautiful hidden gem,"The property and rooms were beautiful and very clean. It was especially lovely to have breakfast on the roof terrace.

 January 2016,5,Beautiful Riad tucked away from the Royale Palace,"Beautiful, clean, and located not far from the Royal Palace, our stay at Riad Khmisa was absolutely incredible and perfect. When we come back to Tetouan in the future, we'll definitely come back here. Mohamed and his wife did everything to make our stay comfortable, even giving us a choice of rooms since it was low-season and we had initially booked the room on the first floor (which I could see as being noisy since breakfast is served right outside). Breakfast was the traditional Moroccan and quite delicious. We loved everything, but definitely have Mohamed or his wife (the owners) pick you up at the main square or pay a local (which is what we did) 5 dirhams to bring you. The medina is really a maze at first and my husband never got a hang of it (though I luckily did)!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2015,5,Relaxing stay in crazy town,"The welcome was nice, the manager offered us tea when we arrived. The rooftop is spectacular, I suggest eating breakfast up there.

 August 2015,5,awesome staying,"Amazing place to stay in Tangier, right in the heart of the Medina. Staff were absolutely incredible in comfort, assistance and always being there. The facility is absolutely beautiful, with amazing views from the rooftop terrace. Not a drawback, but only thing I would note for those not looking for this type of place, it is extremely quiet (but relaxing). If you're looking for the party hostel to meet up with others at 3am in the common area, I don't think this is the place for you.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2015,5,love this place!,I've stayed at Dar Jameel 3 times and find it the perfect charming boutique hotel after a long day of walking the city. The staff at Dar Jameel is super nice an accommodating and has always helped find us a guide (highly recommend Mustafa) to take us to the best places Tangier has to offer and keep the harassment to a minimum. the rooms are so traditionally Moroccan and beautiful and the breakfast in the morning is to die for. The price can't be beat for the customer service and accommodations offered- I recommend staying here to all my friends.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2015,5,Calm oasis from the storm,"Dar Jameel is just the place you'll want, and need, after the chaos that greets you on arriving in Tangier. A beautifully appointed hotel with an amazing rooftop view they easily score high marks on the basics, but that's just the begging. Their attention to detail is what sets them apart. The management team are helpful with advice on seeing the local sites and speak excellent english. Our room was upgraded on arrival, came with tea/coffee facilities, excellent hot water and a strong wifi signal. The breakfast too is great complete with cereals, juice, fruit, breads, crepes, etc. Suffice to say, I would definitely recommend Dar Jameel.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2015,4,Gorgeous and close to the ferry,"On an overnight trip from Tarifa, Spain to Tangier, Morocco, we stayed at Dar Jameel. It was a perfect ending to a very long day spent sightseeing in the city. The quiet of this hotel was very appreciated as we basically just collapsed in our beds that night. A splendid breakfast is served in the morning in a room that overlooks the harbor. But don't expect anything more than a bed, shower, and a good night's sleep as you won't find it here.

 October 2015,5,Truly a 'House of Beauty'... and Grace,"To describe the elegant and peaceful oasis that is Dar Jameel is to believe in all the mystical aspects of a westerner's view of Arabia. The owners have appointed each room and courtyard with affectionate detail and considerable taste. It brings together the beauty and spiritual heart of Morocco. The staff is beyond welcoming and steadying amidst the flow of activity inside and outside the walls of the riad. The views, access, and amenities anticipated my desires and needs. Big thanks to Stefan, his staff, and co-creators for making my stay and wanderings wonderfully comfortable and memorable. I adored the fantasy decor of the Sheherazade Room, but lighted in other rooms with equal delight and comfort. Excellent value for this level of luxurious accomodations.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2015,5,Beautiful oasis,"Having arrived after dark, finding Dar Jameel was a fantastic relief. Beautifully decorated with very helpful staff, our room was very comfortable with a view, just, of the sea. A lovely breakfast too. With our room being at the top, it was quite a haul up the stairs, but did mean we were very handy for breakfast on the same floor!

Located just behind the Hotel Contintental (which is visible from the city port) on the northern outskirts of the medina, the Dar Jameel is a friendly, quiet guesthouse. The host welcomed us with mint tea in the lobby before showing us our room (which was facing the inner courtyard), and gave us a map which he marked with some restaurant recommendations. The Dar's terrace has a striking view overlooking the port and large parts of the medina and the ville nouvelle, and its location makes it perfect for walking around the medina.

Having travelled from Gibraltar/Spain, staying in the narrow streets of the medina was a culture shock! - It may be difficult to navigate there on your own, so would recommend taking a taxi from the port (less than a 10 minute ride). Excellent location if you'd like to stay in the old city and explore the medina.. also walking distance to the masaajid, Tangier beach and the new city (20mins+). The riad itself was beautifully decorated and we were greeted on arrival with mint tea.

He wrote to them beforehand to mention that it was our anniversary and they upgraded us to the ground floor room (close to the reception) which was gorgeous! And there was a beautiful bunch of flowers in our room when we arrived, which was an elegant touch. The room was very, very beautiful. There was an Indian painting which we didn't really get, but everything else was typically Moroccan and lovely. The bathroom was a good size and hot water worked well. We were given some black soap (made locally) which was also great to try. The mattress was quite hard but we liked it, so that was fine.

 October 2015,5,"Lovely old riad, friendly staff, good location","We stayed here one night and would have stayed another, but they were sadly fully booked. Lovely beautiful riad with a good atmosphere and friendly staff. We were shown to the two riads next door for our second night, so it was very convenient. Delicious and wholesome breakfast up on the 3rd floor and delightful view and terrace on the top. All in all, a very relaxing, quiet and easy stay. Would definitely return. Close to the town and sea, lots to do in the medina. Tangier is worth visiting but it was probably the least exciting of the places we visited (Marrakech, fez, chefchaouen, asilah)..they hassle less than in Marrekech though! Asilah is a must visit.

 May 2015,5,Amazing value,"This was our favorite riad in all of Morocco! We were on a long multi-continent journey and didn't make hotel reservations in Tangier as we weren't sure when we would be in town. So we had a list of possible places to stay and Dar Jameel was on the list. Luckily there was an open room and we were able to stay for practically pennies. This was by far the cheapest riad we stayed at during our trip, but it did not feel cheap or leave anything to be desired. The room was large, the service was exceptional and it offered the best rooftop terrace we found. It helped that Tangier is built on a hill so the skyline is more interesting than in other Moroccan cities, but the elevated lounge was the real show stopper. We played cards up there each night and enjoyed the beautiful view of the…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

A very friendly man greeted us with warm mint tea. He then showed us to our room, lots of steps so not ideal for elderly or infirm, we went up 2 flights of steep stairs but it was well worth the climb, we are two couples, family btw, and our room was amazing.

Prior to arriving, we sort of regretted not booking a more expensive room with private bathroom in one of the hotels with aswimming pool, but the reception we got, combined with the overall niceness of Dar Jameel, made those regrets go away. The views from the roof terrace is the best in the city. The staff is friendly and highly professional, and i have no idea how the receptionists managed to respond to our knocking within seconds every single time. On our early morning departure, we found breakfast prepared to take with us to the airport. A nice touch that says a a lot about our experience overall.

And on a morning when we were heading out early, the breakfast was unexpectedly put out early just for us! Highly recommended!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2015,5,"Great, comfortable place to stay in Tangier!","It has a great location in the city center along with a rooftop terrace, free breakfast, and spacious rooms. The whole place was very nicely decorated and comfortable. The hosts were very kind and helpful throughout our stay. I would highly recommend staying here.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2015,5,Perfect Place to Stay In,"The rooms were lovely and nicely lightened. I stayed in the the third floor which has glass sealing and gave the whole floor a refreshing atmosphere. The breakfast was delicious and fresh. Internet connection was widely available and relatively fast. The most amazing thing about the riad is the hospitality of Idrees, the manager, and the riad staff. He was ready to give advices for restaurants and attractions, and maps and directions for the Medina. Nothing to be changed about it, would definitely come back if I ever visited Tangier again, and recommend it for anyone who's visiting Tangier. We thought the stairs were somehow a lot to handle for my mother, but she didn't complain.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2015,5,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Hospitality","My friends and I had the best time during our four day stay at Dar Jameel. The hotel itself is gorgeous, conveniently located in the Medina, and easy to find from the ferry port. We loved eating the delicious, filling breakfast while taking in the beautiful views from the dining room. And I can't write this review without giving my sincerest thanks to the incredibly friendly and helpful staff. Not only did they print out our plane tickets and make hammam reservations for us, but when one of my friends got very sick, the hotel manager, Idriss, so kindly paid for a taxi to take her to the clinic. He truly went above and beyond to take care of us and make us feel at home. I would absolutely recommend a stay at the lovely Dar Jameel!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2015,5,Excellent!!,"It is the best value for money! Going in from the busy streets of the medina one is hapilly surprised by the light and cheerful atmosphere of the hotel. It is spotlessly clean, fresh and nothing is missing. The attention to detail is surprising. There are even bath robes in the room, huge bath towels, a tea kettle and bottled water. All that for the price of a hostel!The terrace has amazing 360º views over the harbour and the medina and there is enough corners in the commun rooms for everyone to have a quiet spot. Eating a delicious breakfast with viws to the water is a supreme luxury. And the staff is very friendly.I can thouroughly recommend it",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2015,5,Mon Petit Chateau,"The people of the hotel Hiram and Idriss were very atentive and kind, they helped with my reservation with Air Royal Maroc and organized my trip to Chefcheouen. I'm a women who travels alone and one of the employees, Hiram, acompannied me to the bus station to buy my ticket. I felt safe and nobody was bothered me. The place looks just like in the pictures, and it is very comfortable. The hotel is inside the Medina, like any medina in Morocco, you have to walk, the hotel was close to the road and car access was easy in comparison to others hotels that I stayed in others cities. If I go back, I will stay and the same place, I saw that it is very close to the port if you come from Spain by ferry, will be just crossing the street. There is a nice restaurant nearby with very tasty…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2014,4,Very pleasant stay,We were happy with our stay in this traditional maroccan Riat. Amazing interior decor and great view of the Medina Clean rooms & very friendly and helpful host Good value for money We would recommend this accommodation,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2015,5,A last minute gem,"We booked this last minute after a change of plans, and what a wonderful surprise. We knew the reviews were good, but we have now stayed 11 nights in Morocco in 4 different places and Dar Jameel is still a favourite amongst them all. Mr Idriss arranged a free pick up from the edge of town, as we arrived quite late after getting a share taxi for 200 dh for 5. We wish we could have stayed longer , the breakfast was excellent and the family room was exceptional as well as the roof top terrace and chill out room Mr Idriss is obviously a very genuine man , who lets his reputation and character attract his customers I can not think of a better start to a Moroccan adventure!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2014,2,"No good, but not too bad either","Of all places I've stayed while in Morocco, this was the worst. I don't mean it was bad, but it was simply the least pleasant of all. Room was, let's say, ""spartan"" and a bit dark. Very good sized, but nothing more, and no windows to the street -- just to the courtyard. Bathroom was in the hall. Breakfast (which was good) was served in a top floor with views of the city. Property is located in the medina, but Tangier's medina was the least interesting of all I've visited in the country. Curiously, I found the ""ville nouvelle"" to be much nicer. I wouldn't recommend this riad as a first option in Tangier.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2014,1,Don't even think about it.,"I booked Dar Jameel through Travelocity back in May for a trip in December. Travelocity confirmed my reservation and said everything was good. I opted to pay at the hotel and thankfully I didn't pay the slightly discounted rate up front. We arrived in Rabat on Monday December 22 and enjoyed two days. Then we left for Tangier on the train. After 5 hours on the train and a taxi ride to the closest into the Medina we could get, we were lead to the door Dar Jameel by these guys that we have dubbed ""Maze Runners"". We get all of our baggage inside and sit down only to discover that Dar Jameel did not have a reservation for us. Now, I didn't just book trough Travelocity and leave it at that. In November I contacted all the Riads we would be staying in to confirm. Dar Jameel's…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2014,5,Beautiful riad in the Medina,"We booked 2 nights here for our family. We initially thought that the only room available for the 3 of us was one on the ground floor, so we were nicely surprised to get one of the rooms on the 3rd floor. The beds are firm (like a futon) but comfortable. The bathroom and shower were just outside of the room but this wasn't a problem. Jamal was very helpful and helped to make phone calls so that I could find a guide for the next day. The inside of this hotel is gorgeous with tilework from floor to ceiling. We enjoyed relaxing in the ""Chill out"" room. The hotel manager/owner, Idris, introduced himself and was very hospitable. The wifi worked well. We loved the bountiful breakfast of olives, several breads, cheeses, pastries, granola, yogurt, fruit, fresh orange juice, coffee…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2014,4,Great first night in Morocco,"The personnel at Dar Jameel was very welcoming on our first night in Tangier. The common spaces were beautiful, and the staff helped us infinitely. (When we found it difficult trying to get a car rental at the last minute, a staff member was able to put us in touch with a company that proved great service. ) We had a great, huge room, at Dar Jameel with lots of ventilation, and very clean. Breakfast was good, with lots of choice - there were cereals and coffee and juice, cheese, yoghurt and various breads, fruits. The location of the dar is great, right in the Medina, an easy walk everywhere, and yet somehow quiet. The room where breakfast was served has a great view of the sea and rooftops. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2014,5,Very Nice Stay,Just returned from a week long trip in Tangier staying at Dar Jameel. Had a nice stay in this Riad that is conveniently located in the Medina. Room was on the upper floor and had a nice view of the Mediterranean. Breakfast was wonderful and plenteous each morning. Staff was very accommodating and helpful for tips in the area. Thanks for the great stay.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2014,5,PERFECT first night in Morocco,"This dar was our introduction to Morocco and it couldn't have been better. We just couldn't believe how nice it was! They had water waiting for us in our room which was wonderful. The terrace is beautiful and there's this great room to hang out in on the terrace if you don't want to be outside. Breakfast is lovely as it us also upstairs where it is bright and sunny. They also offered the largest spread from any hotel we stayed in during our 24 stay in Morocco which was a major plus. The staff were friendly and helpful. They arranged taxis for us at affordable prices- totally worth it. They also have a chill-out room where no cell phones are allowed- love that. =) If it's your first hotel in Morocco, enjoy...bc they're not all like this one! Ha! ENJOY!!!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2014,5,My first stop in Marocco,"We were travelling to Marocco being tired after exploring the spanish coast and pretty anxious after longer than expected ferry trip from Tarifa (almost 3h on board!). Once we reached Dar Jameel, we were immediately stunned by the quality of service from the very beginning. We were served the maroccan tea while waiting for some documents to be prepared. Then we were guided to our room which was astonishing. It was not the end of the suprise - the terrace at the top of the riad with the beatiful view on the new city, medina, kasbah and sea with Europe on the horison. For the money we paid for that night for two people the experience was fantastic. I was really glad that my first maroccan experience was shared at Dar Jameel. I reccomend to everyone to stay at that riad while in…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2014,5,Tranquility away from the medina,"Absolutely stunning hotel tucked away down a little side alley. One of the many friendly staff members welcomed us into the cool, quiet reception area, allowing for some appreciation of the incredible architecture and decor. Our room was on the ground floor, with a bathroom across the reception. It was stunning. The breakfast was sufficient, and the waiter was helpful. We had a little trouble finding it, however once we had found our bearings it was easy. Go in the medina opposite the port, stay right, past the continental, left across the small car park and straight in front on the right.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2014,2,Strange Vibes,"This place has a great location and a beautiful environment. It's too bad it isn't run well. The front desk people have to let you in each and every time you come back to the hotel, so you stand outside on the street and wait. Sometimes we waited for 5 minutes, sometimes we waited for 20 minutes. Then someone would answer looking like they'd just awoken from a nap. No apologies, no explanations. It's mostly an issue of being understaffed but it feels like you aren't welcome and like the place is a ghost town. Anytime you ask a question of one of the men at the desk, they seem confused that you're talking to them. Also. The beds were ridiculously uncomfortable. For my money, I'd go stay at one of the neighboring places - far more charming, far nicer people - the Tangerina. …",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2014,5,Loved it!,We had a fabulous 3-night stay at Dar Jameel. The staff were fabulous and very helpful. Our room was stunningly beautiful and the price was very reasonable. We took advantage of their very cheap laundry service that was very much appreciated after a great deal of travel. The breakfast each morning was simple but delicious. Couldn't recommend staying here enough. Would definitely do it again!,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2014,5,Paradise,"We all just loved this place. We were doing a family trip from New Zealand to see family in Europe and were staying in Southern Spain. We went to Tangier for an overnight trip for a taste of Morocco. We took the ferry from Tarifa to Tangier. It would have been a little tricky to find the Riad if it were not for the many guides and taxi's at the port that were falling over themselves to take us there. In the end one guy led us there, while it was not far, it was a complicated windy trail through the Medina. On arrival we were greeted with Moroccan Mint tea, which is the best thing in the world. Even the kids loved it! The Riad was just beautiful, and the photos do not do it justice. It was a quiet oasis from the streets of the busy Medina. So, so quiet and peaceful. The…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2014,4,Great place to stay,"I had the pleasure of staying at this guesthouse as I travelled to tangier. It was amazing inside, very clean and absolutely great staff. My room was on the top floor and it is very spacious. The staff were very helpful for shopping and organizing a taxi in the morning. I would stay there again.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2014,5,Tangerine Dream!,"Dar Jameel is situated in the heart of the Medina and finding it was the first part of our amazing adventure, due to its labyrinth of winding alleyways. We arrived slightly earlier than expected, but were warmly greeted by the hotel manager, Iddris. He was very accommodating from the moment we walked in, offering us a glass of fresh mint tea, which was greatly appreciated after our trip. The hotel is beautiful and decorated in traditional Moroccan design. If you're looking for an authentic place to stay, I doubt you would find much better in the area. It is adorned with classic Islamic tiling from floor to ceiling, creating a tranquil and calm atmosphere. All areas for guests continue this theme and the roof terrace offers fantastic views of the Medina, port, beach and the new…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2014,4,A beautiful riad,"t's a beautiful riad in a great location, it's in the Medina. Good price. In a quiet alley. The family room is a good size. Breakfast is very good. Staff are very helpful. The best spot to relax and nap is on the topmost penthouse. It offers a great sea breeze most of the day. There is a slight sewer smell when we got in. You have to cover the sink with the stopper to prevent the smell lingering in the room. Also turning on the exhaust fan helps. The beds are firm.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2014,5,Beautiful guesthouse in an excellent location,"We were wowed by Dar Jameel from the moment we stepped into the reception lobby. The guesthouse is incredibly beautiful, with intricate tiling and detailed molding that extends throughout the entire building, including the guestrooms. We stayed in Dar Jameel for two nights total, once at the beginning of our Morocco trip and once at the end. Both times we got lovely rooms with all the amenities (comfy beds, wifi, hair dryer, bottled water, etc.). The rooftop terrace was gorgeous and provides a view of the ocean as well as the Medina -- the best of both worlds! There are many places to just sit and relax within the guesthouse, from the rooftop to the common room to the dining areas. The staff at Dar Jameel were extremely courteous and professional! The guesthouse also…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2014,4,A wonderful place to unwind after a long day exploring!,"We stayed at Dar Jameel for three great nights! We payed a little bit extra for an upstairs room with a private bath and an air conditioning unit, but it was entirely worth it! We arrived from the port in the pouring rain and were welcomed with mint tea. The men at the front desk were all so helpful! They offered dining suggestions, directions, and even recommended a barber shop. The hotel was very beautifully decorated with many common spaces and the added bonus of rooftop access. Getting breakfast served every morning was just what we needed for our long days of walking around and exploring. I would highly recommend staying at this wonderful hotel!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2014,3,"Great location, friendly staff & Nice room",We stayed at Dar Jameel for a night. The location was great. It's walking distance from the port but inside the medina. The breakfast was served on the top floor and quite nice. The staff were friendly enough.... The room was clean and quite spacious. The only drawback was that the toilet / shower was not in the room - they were private but we had to go outside our room for toilet / shower which was kind of weird.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2014,5,"Good location, comfortable and friendly","My husband and I stayed here in January--it was our first time in Morocco. We took the ferry over from Spain and stayed two nights before renting a car for 10 more days in Morocco. The Riad is very beautiful, with lots of original tile and woodwork; the beds were the most comfortable we slept in on the whole trip. The breakfasts were great each morning, and the view from the top floor where breakfast is served is really pleasant. Breakfast included fruit, fresh cheese, olives, yogurt (packaged) and several kinds of fresh breads, plus they will cook eggs to order. The location is good, and once you orient yourself, it is actually very easy to find/retrace your steps. It is convenient to the main shopping streets, very easy to walk out of the medina either on the coast side…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2014,5,"Great stay, incredibly helpful staff!","We had a wonderful one night visit at Dar Jameel. The staff were SOOO helpful - they helped us connect with our driver who was lost (he literally drove us and our luggage to meet our driver)!! The included breakfast was perfect. Overall, a great place to stay! Also, relatively easy to find.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2014,3,"Not a bad choice, but beware of the limitations","What Dar Jameel has going for it is a good location within Tangier's medina -- just a half block from the Continental Hotel (a landmark reachable by taxi drivers.) The ornamentation of the lobby and rooms is also striking. And the rooftop dining room and breakfast satisfied. All of which makes Dar Jameel a good deal for the money. On the negative side, our room offered barely enough room to maneuver, and the (allegedly private) bathroom was through the lobby and down a hall. Not a bad choice, but beware of the limitations.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2014,4,a rainy weekend in Tanger,"That's the rist when you arrange a weekend at the end of February, rain in Tanger. The first time, I know the city very well and it is always nice weather. We stayed in Dar Jameel as I saw in Tripadvisor that overall rating was very good. A really nice placve to stay, staff are helpful and friendly. Beautiful mosaics in the ground-floor area. Probably due to the rain there was a constant smell in our room of humidity and even our clothes, after a weekend, had that smell. Breakfast was very good and complete. We had the possibility to make coffee or tea in our room but after 1 day there were no tea bags anymore, we asked for some more but impossible? The coffee bags in our room were only deaf, no normal ones. Asking for a hair dryer remained also without result.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2014,4,Modernized hotel but still conserves a traditional charm,"Overall a really nice place to stay, well situated within the medina. A dar is a town house build around a central open-roof (sheltered nowadays), ground-floor area but with no or not a lot of opening towards the outside. I only stayed in houses like this during my stay in Morocco and this one was definetely the most comfortable (and expensive) one I was in. The lower floors have really conserved their traditional aspect. The top floors lack a bit of charm but are more open onto the outside, especially thanks to a lovely rooftop terrace.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2014,5,Amazing place!!,"This hotel has it all! Right from when you enter the front doors you feel the nice atmosphere. Staff are helpful and friendly. Rooms and interior decor is stunning. Wonderful mosaics and it really feels like a boutique hotel but at a great price. We paid 30 EUR for a night. Located on the sea side of the Medina. Take note - ensure you know your way before entering the medina, do not be led by any locals or they will take you anyway they like and expect a tip!! Would stay here again anytime we are in Tangier!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2014,5,Great house and location,"A fantastic find near the medina in Tangier. A bit claustrophobic in the first floor rooms and no privacy... since you can hear everything in first floor rooms but when we were moved to a 2nd floor room it changed our experience. Beautiful, bright. Great breakfast. Couldn't have asked for more price/quality.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2013,5,Fantastic place,"I was very happy i chose to stay at Dar Jameel, the property is truely stunning throughout, beautiful decor, comfortable beds, yummy breakfast and very helpful staff. The location is also great, just up from the ferry and a short cab ride to the train station (idriss even walked me down and helped me find a cab the morning of my departure) right on the edge of the medina, so easy to find, but still within easy access of the fascinating old town of Tangiers. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying here.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2014,5,"Beautiful rooms, fantastic location!","We very much enjoyed our stay at Dar Jameel in the Tafraout room. The room was small and the bed was hard by American standards, but the ambiance of the room more than made up for it. I loved lying in bed and looking at the sculpted and painted plaster ceiling. The bathroom situation was a little strange as we had a private restroom just outside the hotel room and a shower just across the way, but it wasn't a problem at all. The electric heater kept up with the winter chill and there was plenty of hot water for the showers. The rooms were extremely quiet, we only ever saw other guests at breakfast. The Breakfast was wonderful with fresh breads and eggs made to order. Staff was helpful in making further travel arrangements for us. We loved that the hotel was located…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2013,5,Lovely experience!,"The service started even before I arrived. I e-mailed to ask for advice on how to get to the hotel from the train station, and the manager, Idriss, responded to me right away with a helpful e-mail. Even though it’s in the medina, it’s easy to find because it’s near the outer edge of the medina and near the Hotel Continental. The hotel is beautiful, and my room was lovely, clean and spacious. I can understand what another reviewer said about the light coming in at night- above the door to the room is a stained glass window, and the lights from the inner courtyard of the hotel do shine in a little. This wasn’t a problem for me because I always travel with an eye mask, and also, the lights are turned off at night (maybe 10 or 11?). The staff is wonderful here – Idriss offered…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2013,5,My best hotel experience in Morocco,We went to Tangier in Nov 2013 and stayed for 2 nights. Beautiful and delicate decor. Very clean and with heater! Breakfast with a view was phenomenal. Most important -- very honest and helpful staff and DID NOT have to worry that we would be ripped off.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2013,4,Very helpful and pleasant staff,"My partner and I stayed at Dar Jameel for one night following a 15hr journey from London, and were promptly met by a taxi arranged by the hotel to take us from the airport. The hotel is clean and well kept, with cozy rooms and lovely intricate mosiaics and tiling throughout. We stayed in the ""Leila"" room, which was decorated very nicely and had a very sturdy and comfortable bed. The hotel features all the usual niceties: free wi-fi, hot shower, a plentiful breakfast and very pleasant and friendly staff. The location is quite close to the port and train station, which was excellent or us as we were catching the train to Fez the next day, and again, the hotel was happy to arrange a taxi for us.

 December 2012,5,Tranquil haven in the madness of the Medina,"We found this little oasis on Tripadvisor and it was as good as the reviewers had written. Set just off the centre of the Medina, this quiet, clean and quirky Riad is an ideal place to escape from the madness of the Medina in Tangiers. Extremely helpful staff advised us on nearby restaurants to suit all tastes and pockets. WiFi connection was useful and the rooftop breakfast room gave an astounding view across the city. The rooftop lounge with heat resistant glass all round and air circulation was an idyllic place to relax after a day in the city. Thoroughly recommended!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2013,4,Great Location,"An excellent location on the edge of the medina, very close to the port. We could have walked from the ferry, but we took a taxi because negotiating the medina was a little daunting on our first day.

 October 2013,5,"Beautiful place, perfect location","Me and my friends spent one night at Dar Jameel in October. It is a traditional riad style guest house in the medina. The location is perfect, you can start exploring the medina directly from the guest house. The place is very clean and beautiful, typical moroccan style, so colorful!. The owner was very nice and helpful. The breakfast was big and delicious served at the top of the buliding with a nice sea view. You can go to the roof of the building and enjoy the beautiful panaroma of the medina and sea. If I ever come to Tanger, I will stay at Dar Jameel:)",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2013,5,Most wonderful place to stay in Tanger!,"I stayed in this hotel with my husband (35 - 40 years) and my parents (65-67 years) and all the four of us were amazed and impressed by: the very warm welcome by Idriss the house manager, the look of the wonderful architecture and superb restoration of this traditional Riad, the rooms, the breakfast, the location, just everything. On arrival we got a cup of mint tea and a traditional baklawa sweet, which I thought was a very nice detail. I was not very well prepared regarding the city and the things to do and where to go, but Idriss was very helpful and answered all my questions patiently and with a big smile! He gave me a map of the Medina and told us where to go and where not to.

It's a 10 minute easy walk from the Port and you are right in the middle of old Tangiers. When you walk through the door silence engulfs you and a wonderful calm descends. Each floor presents it's wow factor and the roof sanctuary is the star attraction.

The interior was done beautifully, and when we first checked in, we had a great time just looking around at the different rooms and floors and admiring the atrium and rooftop.

 August 2013,5,The best hostel in Morocco.,"OK, it's true. Me and my wife always go for the cheapest and we're kind of used to having some issues with the places where we stay. But Dar Jameel is simply amzing. The people who work there take great pride in what they do. And they do it well. All our needs were met and everyone was always nice, intelligent, kind and polite. That's specially meaningful when you are being chased by 5 touts who demand your money. Don't worry, the folks at Dar Jameel got your back. You get to sleep in a beautifully decorated and absolutely clean room; you wake up to be taken to a terrace where someone will bring you a delicious breakfast. They will always get you what you need even before you ask for it. That's right, I'm not used to being treated this well!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2013,5,Great Riad in the Medina,"This was the first time I have styed in a Riad, and in the Medina. It was little hard to locate but once there it is a Gem. It is a wonderful place run by a great owner and filled with good staff. We were on the first floor, in a room with no windows (it was a good room), the owner went out of his way to give us an amazing room, the hospitality was outstanding. The view from the rooftop was a great and inside was very well decorated. Overall it exceeded our expectations and I highly recommend the place.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2013,4,Wonderful Riad!,"Ok I will be honest... I was scared at the alleyways leading up to this riad. But it was a WONDERFUL place filled with staff that is SO helpful and, I mean this, ... caring. They cared for their guests and it was something I loved. The view from the rooftop was a amazing as well. Cost was very reasonable. Shared bathroom, but that is not uncommon.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2013,5,excellent service and stay,stayed here for a night in tangier in late july. The staff was incredibly helpful and made sure that we were safe at all times. the riad was beautiful and gave a taste of morocco which was situated inside the medina. the terrace had a great panaromic view of the city. i would deifnitely stay here again if i went to tangier again.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2013,5,a quiet oasis in the middle of medina,"We stayed one night in the dar jaleem with my friend. It is only a short walk from the port so we didnt have to take a taxi. The building is amazing! It is a perfectly restored typical marroccon style building with 4 floors and a roof terrace,we spent lots of time making photos in the various rooms and at the terrace,from where there is a beautiful view over the port and the medina. Our room was spotless clean and very quite despite it was on the ground floor and the windows overlooked the main courtyard. The staff was very kind and helpful,they helped us with the directions in the medina,gave us lots of infos about money exchange and restaurants and even let us use the computer in the reception. The breakfast was served upstairs,both quality and quantity was great.We had a nice…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2012,5,Amazing,"Stayed here for two nights, spent another two nights in a different hotel in Tangier. Dar Jameel was definitely the better hotel of the two we stayed in on our trip. The service was absolutely amazing, everyone was very willing to help us and answer any questions we had. Would definitely recommend staying here over some of the other 'resort-like' hotels, this hotel has a much better feel to it!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2013,4,Beautiful oasis in the old city.,"A bit tricky to find but a hidden treasure tucked away in a narrow alley in the old city. We stayed in a suite overlooking the harbour of Tangiers for 58 euros. There is no lift so be prepared for plenty of stair climbing. The view from the terrace on top of the building is spectacular. The room was spacious and elegantly presented. There was an air conditioner and a dehumidifier in the room. Tea, coffee and water were provided and the stay included a nice breakfast. Something a bit different.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2013,4,Beautiful but...,"I stayed here for one night at the end of an 8-day trip to Morocco. I'd already stayed in Fes for 2 nights, Casablanca 2 nights, Marrakech 2 nights and I arrived in Tangier by overnight train from Marrakech. I've really struggled with this review as I'm comparing Dar Jameel with the other places I stayed in. I've taken into account the cities I was staying in and the relative merits of the places I stayed at. Had I stayed nowhere else in Morocco I would have awarded this place a strong 4-star rating, but I cannot give it 5 stars. As it is, my 4-star rating is verging on only 3. What keeps it at the higher level is the sheer beauty of the property, the friendly staff, its excellent location and the great breakfast. What lets it down in my opinion is that I feel it doesn't offer…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2013,5,Great respite in the medina,"We enjoyed our short stay in this beautiful hotel. The staff was nice and friendly, everything was clean, and it has a great location at the edge of the medina, so it is easy to get to the beach and downtown, as well as the media. Only drawback for us was that the breakfast was very bready.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2013,5,Great great place to stay in Tangier.,"Great hotel in the Medina area of Tangier. The hotel was beautiful, the room was great, with both a bed and a couch and a bigger table. And a private bathroom. The location was good, easy to find, and it felt like a very safe and comfortable place. I only stayed for one night at Dar Jameel, and therefore only experienced the great breakfast once. The breakfast was a lot of different breads and spreads, moroccan style, and you sat in a pretty little (indoors) breakfast area on the roof. There was also a great great view of the city from the roof. Would definitely recommend.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2013,4,"excellent location, VERY excellent breakfast","Stayed in April of 2013. It's is approximately 5-7 min walk from the ferry. It's a cute little place with a beautiful rooftop with a view of the city and harbor, clean, and the service was EXCELLENT and very friendly. The front office guy helped to book my ferry tickets to Spain. We had the best breakfast we had in Morocco on their super cute patio area. Fresh OJ, very fresh, plump olives, and flakey pastries. The only reason why I took a point off is that it's pretty noisy. At three in the morning I had to (politely) pantomime to a french couple to take their convo inside their own room. It's not that they were particularly loud but they place echos and everyone can hear your conversation. We also stayed in the from room on the bottom floor. I believe the bathroom…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2013,5,Mustapha is brilliant,We had arrived at Tangier on a cruise ship. Not wishing to pay the exhorbitant prices charge by Thomson for a trip around we wandered to the dock gates and luckily met Mustapha. There were 4 of us and for £40 he took us by Taxi (there & back) and we had a proper guided tour of the old and new town including a visit to the English Church and a communal bakery where the locals turn up to have their bread baked. I asked Mustapha what the bakery charged and he told me that you payed whatever you wanted. No such thing as a fixed price. Pity some places in the U.K. don't adopt a similar scheme!!. He even said that if we were not happy with his tour we did not have to pay him at all. No money changes hand until the end of the your tour. We compared notes with fellow cruisers who had…,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2013,5,An Oasis Just Like the Photos,"We stayed two nights and it was apparent that this Dar is immaculately clean, beautiful and run efficiently by the sweeter than sweet manager, Idriss, the kindest man in Morocco. With the kindest of welcomes, we were shown to our room and he brought us some fresh mint tea. The next morning we went upstairs to the top floor for breakfast and what a lovely view! The pictures do not lie, this is just what you get when you stay here. The breakfast was massive! Both mornings was just slightly different but essentially the same, eggs any style you want upon request, warm drink of choice plus fresh squeezed orange juice, water, pastry, breads, butter, jam, cheese spread, choice of cereal with milk, yogurt or fruit cup, olives, etc. The massive spread was accompanied by mood music…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2013,4,Charming Option,"Stayed in Tangier for 2 personal days before a week of working in Rabat. Wanted a riad - something with charm and character. Got it - and good value! The inside is well-restored and charming, and stays remarkably cool despite the heat outside. Rooms are comfortable, and the water is hot. Location at the edge of the Medina - but still accessible via car - was a huge plus. The included breakfast was different (and excellent) each day. Having wifi was a HUGE bonus, and the rooftop deck with a view of the water was outstanding. Staff are helpful and attentive. Would recommend.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2013,5,“AMAZING DAR JAMEEL!”,"I visited this amazing maison d'hôte in May 2013, for 3 nights, and I loved it so much! Dar Jameel is a perfect location to discover the charm of Tangier by foot because it is located on the edge of Tangiers’ medina, a short walk from the beach, the Kasbah, the International port and the centre of town. A welcoming and intimate riad in traditional Moroccan style tiled with stunning mosaics and centred around a covered courtyard. A real ""The Thousand and One Nights"" atmosphere! In confirmation of my impression, I stayed in the “Sharazade” double room... a lovely and clean suite with private tadelakt bathroom, extra long beds, free Wi-Fi, tea/coffee maker... the room was also supplied with a bottle of water and sweeties when I arrived and mint tea and coffee is available for…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2013,4,Close to the ferry,"A short stay in Tangier prior to catching the ferry to Tarifa, we chose Dar Jameel due to its proximity to the pier (it is also only a brief stroll to the main streets of the medina). We didn't catch the name of the night guardian but he was a very friendly and helpful young man, and kindly walked us to the Dar as our driver was unable to manipulate his van around the tiny streets near the Hotel Continental. Our group stayed in the Hamri, Agoumi and Leila rooms. Hamri and Agoumi are the only rooms on the first floor, and share a clean, private bathroom with plenty of hot water (bathrobes are provided). Leila is on the top floor and has a cute little ensuite, and also a tea kettle. The rooms aren't huge, but perfectly adequate for a comfortable night's rest. We planned to…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2013,5,A Magical Experience in the Medina,"This riad is amazing! The beautiful Moroccan decor and peaceful vibe was exceeded only by the warm and friendly staff who knows how to make guests feel pampered and very special. During our family's month- long trip through Europe & Africa, our 2-day stop in Tangier was absolutely the highlight of our entire journey. Our family's every request was met with true Moroccan hospitality. Yasin and Mustafa are wonderful guys, and will remain lifelong friends to our family.

 April 2013,5,Five Star Experience in the Medina at Dar Jameel!,"Please know that my ratings on a property are for the overall experience I encounter when I stay there. A five star experience is much different than a five star property and this is one of those cases. I traveled with my family of four (wife and two daughters) to Tangier on April 12th for an overnight excursion. We did not book our accommodations until the night before and Leyton at Dar Jameel was very responsive to my questions via email (darjameel@yahoo.com). My room was 108 euros for the night and included accommodations in a ""family room"" that easily slept my family as well as breakfast for all four of us. We took the ferry from Tarifa to Tangier and arrived at approximately 9am local time. We took a taxi from the port to Dar Jameel for 5 euros. We were obviously there…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2013,4,An oasis in the old medina. A must for an AUTHENTIC Tangier experience,"A lot if 5's for this property and I really liked this place but could not give 5 star in deference to other 5 star properties I've stayed at like several Ritz Carlton, the Montage, Bellagio, Wynn....Dar Jameel is great but not a 5 on the scale of other 5's despite the generous ratings. What I rated as a 5 is the OUTSTANDING staff and customer care. Mostafa in particularly went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed, provided advice and directions etc. I selected Dar Jameel for its location and the excellent reviews. I wanted an authentic experience and that's exactly what I got.

The alley to get to this riad is quite scary, please becareful, a lot of the people standing outside are finding opportunity to take advantage of u. Btw, breakfast was very good, with good view too! My room was on top floor where they served breakfast. That room have a bathroom inside, they also provide kettle and good wifi coverage. Sadly we checked out early to catch the ferry to Tarifa. Love my stay here and would recommend it to everybody. The price is very reasonable. Worth worth worth paying for it.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2013,3,"Nice Dar, but cant rate it 5 stars - takes a lot more than this to get my rating","Let me start by saying this is not a negative review – its more of a sane one id like to comment in comparison to all the gushing ones before. Not hard to find the Dar. This is not a RIAD as someone had commented before – there is a difference. Just a short walk from the port – as long as you don’t have heavy bags ! Its certainly taller or better placed than surrounding buildings. Greeted by Idris, a very nice chap indeed as were all the staff we had limited exposure to on our 1 night. Apart from the steep stairs up to the top floor just under the terrace – we liked the large room – as we had gone for the sleeps 4 as we had kids with us.

We found this hidden palace by coincidence and as soon as we walked in we felt at home. Idriss greeted us with his beautiful smile and offered some mint tea immediately.We enjoyed the view from roof terrace while having our tea. My room was next to the reception with a private bathroom and friends stayed on the second floor. Their bathroom was outside the room but they wouldn't mind .

 February 2013,5,A real riad in the medina,"We just have to agree with all the others who gives this superb riad full marks. A beautifully restored old city palace, wonderful view from the roof terrace, very nice and cosy rooms, everything comfortable. And the personnel are extremely helpful and charming. Great location too, on the edge of the medina, so one can just walk straight out into it. Since the medina is fairly small, you don`t risk getting lost. We had one complaint, however. Our two rooms on the second floor had a shared, bathroom, meant to be private for just us. But since this was not clearly marked, other people tended to use it too, which we were not very happy about. After talking to the manager, they put up a sign on the bathroom door, and ""compensated"" us with a nice bottle of wine. All in all a very…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2013,5,Excellent place to stay in Tangier,"We stayed in Tangier for 4 days. The Riad is located in the middle of the ""medina"". So, great location if you look for knowing the old-city. The staff was really helpful. They helped us with every single need that we had. Regarding to the tours and places you can visit in Tangier and close to Tangier( like Asilah or Chefchaouen) the Riad has some trusted taxi drivers that they pick you up in the hotel and take you to that place while giving you some kind of tour. Really worthy. Honestly one of the best places I have stayed.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2013,5,Excellent service,"This beautiful riad offers the kindest of service by the charming manager Idriss. Rooms were very clean with excellent WiFi.

 April 2012,5,Lovely lovely stay,"I always forget to write a review for places that I really like. I stayed at Dar Jameel last april with my boyfriend and some friends. We came from a particularly dirty ferry all the way from Barcelona. Boy, where we happy to have booked here!! Absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. Super friendly staff, delicious breakfast and a really nice and spacious room. The building was amazing as well. Four or five floors if i remember correctly, the top one having a whole glass floor which was actually pretty scary in the beginning. The roof deck had a stunning view. Nice plants inside the building. It was a very pretty and clean B&B in a busy and rough town. Everybody loved it.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2013,5,A Hidden Moroccan Gem,"First impressions when we arrived at Dar Jameel were that the hotel was incredibly beautiful and stereotypically Moroccan, precisely what we wanted from our stay. The hotel manager and breakfast staff were amazing and couldn't do enough in order to make our stay as pleasurable as possible - extremely cheerful, helpful and attentive. The hotel is vibrant and relaxing, a lovely getaway for couples such as ourselves. Although the hotel surroundings appear less beautiful than within the hotel, the experience was precisely what we wanted - a culture shock. Would certainly recommend the hotel to all, and will definitely stay here again if we were to ever pass through Tangier in the future.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2013,5,Incredible Staff,"The absolutely only negative to staying at Dar Jameel is the rooms can be a bit tight occasionally. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing poor to say about staying at this hotel. The staff are some of the kindest and most detail oriented people I have ever met- when they discovered my group would be leaving before breakfast they made up brown bag breakfasts for all 10 of us to take with us. The inside of the hotel itself is beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. The rooftop terrace is breathtaking for views of both the medina and the newer portion of Tangier. The staff treated us as if we were family- showing us to the best places to eat nearby and teaching us how to make mint tea perfectly. The best part of everything is it is a great deal price wise!

 December 2012,3,Well situated but some disappointing aspects!,"I had always wanted to stay in a Riad and as we were touring Spain in our camper van went as foot passengers 24/ 25 December. The staff were excellent, Christmas day breakfast also, less so on 26th December. However our room was so much smaller than photos AND being on ground floor VERY very noisy! My husband had to ask a tour guide to move away whilst we were trying to have a siesta. You knock on the front door on returning, there is a 24 hour service, but we heard everyone as they returned; not their fault as they wouldn't have realised. The Manager agreed it WAS a problem!!There wasn't enough hot water for us both to have a shower in the morning.We went for the more expensive en suite room and it was somewhat disppointing! It's well situated for the Medina.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2013,5,"Great hotel, excellent service.","Fantastic hotel, very ornate and provides a unique Moroccan experience. The staff were very helpful and were able to provide usefull advice, order pizza or just have a chat. The room was very nice, we were upgraded to the top floor room with the en-suite despite having bought a cheaper room for free as the hotel was quiet. It had air conditioning, coffee and a kettle, a double bed, and a private bathroom. Breakfast was fantastic and substantial, plenty of general/lounge areas with books/cd players including a conservatory area on the roof which was wonderful at night for a romantic meal.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2012,4,Excellent service!!,"We (me and my dad) stayed here while visiting tangier. change in our plans meant we were here barely for 12 hrs. We stayed in the cheapest room which suited our purpose fine..but it was weird as it was smack opposite the reception ..and there was no external window for fresh air or fan. There was a big window which opened in the space between reception and room but if staying as a couple there is serious loss of privacy plus you hear noise everytime someone walks in or out. In short, just go for some room on the upper floors. The riad in itself is nicely decorated. Its near the port (but 15 mins uphill walk if you are thinking of walking with luggage!!).

 December 2012,4,Nice retreat from a filthy city,"We stayed 2 nights at the Dar Jameel (2 adults with 2 kids). The only compliant we had are the beds. These mattresses are probably stuffed with camel hair and are unbelievable hard and uncomfortable for our delicate northern European backs. Our room was a family room with 2 double beds on the 3rd floor. Nice large room and windows to the outside (not much of a view though). The bathroom's walls did not go all the way up to the ceiling, so one hears everything going on in there. Also, don't faint when arriving at the drop-off place where the taxi lets you get out (just a bit beyond the Continental Hotel entrance). It is dingy with non-confidence inspiring people hanging around). Go into the dark alley and after a few steps, the door is on the right. Then it is like stepping…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2012,4,Good place to stay in Tangier,"We stayed here for two nights, and found it very good. The house is beautifully presented, with excellent views of of the Port.

 July 2012,5,"Authentic, Friendly Stay","We spent an overnight in this riad. It was a wonderful, restful stay in Tangier. The rooms and public sitting areas are wonderful and condusive to meeting other travelers. We met a family and went for dinner together. It was Ramadan during our time in Tangier and that was most interesting to be eating and walking the Medina at midnight and early morning hours. The staff was fantastic and made sure we were comfortable and lacking nothing. They organized a taxi to take us to the local Hammam which was a wonderful experience. Our room was very comfortable with a private bathroom. It was a walkable distance to the ferry. The breakfast was very good and we enjoyed the mint tea that was offered anytime. We would highly recommend Dar Jameel.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

Breakfast was very good and the view fantastic. Highly recommended for the authentic feeling.,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2012,5,Absolutely fantastic,"We stayed here for two nights, and it was a great experience. Not only was the riad beautiful and a tranquil haven from the bustle outside, but all the people working there were very friendly and really seemed to make an effort to make our stay pleasant - thanks particularly to Leighton! They paid attention to detail, breakfasts were delicious, and there was even a bookcase of (good) books to borrow while we were there. Everything seemed very clean and cared for and what's more, there was a great view from the terrace. If I go to Tangiers again, I would definitely come back to Dar Jameel.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

From the outside, nothing special, but open that front door and WOW. The carving and tile work is stunning! The only room left was their Family Room but because it was just two of us, they charged 1/2 price. We had tons of room (2 double beds inside) and loved the alcove they had build for the bathroom. Water pressure was terrible in the shower and we couldn't work out the air con in the room. The roof top was stunning in day and night and the breakfast included was just enough. Perfect location for exploring the old town. Loved it.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2012,5,Great Tangiers Experience,"We stayed in Dar Jameel for one night with our two girls - we took a ferry over from Tarifa. The hotel is very clean and the patio provides spectacular views of Tangiers. As it was a family room (two doubles) we did have our own ensuite (small but functional). While it is very close to the ferry port, it is not easy to find as it is located on a very narrow pedestrian street - if you are coming off the ferry, you are a well walking to the hotel. Use the Hotel Continental as your bearings (very obvious building overlooking the port). Do expect to get hassled in the ferry port by taxi drivers... The only other was being awoken at sunrise for prayers as the hotel is very close to a mosque.

 August 2012,5,Incredible place to stay!,"We had an incredible stay at Dar Jameel. The location could not be better right in the heart of the Medina - walk to everything. However, once inside Dar Jameel it is a private oasis - so quiet & peaceful. The decor is beautiful with true Morocco flair - tile, woodwork, etc. The hosts could not have been nicer & make the best mint tea! Very clean rooms, bathrooms, etc. Breakfast was a delicious traditional Moroccan breakfast included with the stay. beautiful rooftop views, walking distance to the port.

There was one shared external bathroom for the two rooms on our floor of the guesthouse. It was spotless and comfortable. The Welsh owner was more than helpful, ready to answer all questions we had. Breakfast was very enjoyable, with some fresh fruit, pain au chocolat, eggs, tea/coffee and Moroccan bread, taken in a lovely, sunny room. We took a taxi from the airport and it went inside the medina and dropped us off almost right outside Dar Jameel, so it was not difficult to find at all (our taxi driver knew where it was).

 July 2012,5,Highly recommended for a memorable stay in Tangier,"We had a fantastic time there. Charming building and room decor, wonderful staff with English proficiency, great breakfast and a view of the harbor. Located within the authentic old Medina. Given the rate, this place offers a great value. It is right next to Hotel Continental but unlike the very commercial Continental (where FRS places trippers from Tarifa that purchase overnight package deals), it is a small establishment with a genuinely family-owned feel. We walked from the ferry terminal and it was just a little hard to find as the GPS didn't quite send us to the exact location; a little more signage would have helped, but that obviously won't be a problem if you have a guide and/or transport.

You want to go to the old port near city, not new one. We were met by Idras at the Continental Hotel who took us to the Riad and offered tea and helped us bring bags to hotel. Great location to Central Madina. Idras set us up with a map and directions. I would not travel during Ramadan, limited in food for westerners.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2012,5,Tranquil oasis in Tangier,"Arriving on the ferry from Tarifa, Spain we were expecting a bit of a hassle with touts and taxi drivers after reading some posts on Lonely Planet Thorn Tree. We were fortunate to run into an official guide Mustapha who walked us to the Dar Jameel (up some rather steep steps) and made the whole experience fun. The next day he gave us a lovely tour through Tangier. Be sure to request him as your guide. They know him at the Dar Jameel. Chediak Chaoui Mustapha Guide # 680. He is reasonable, entertaining and speaks excellent English. The Dar Jameel is a wonderful place to stay. It is beautiful, quiet and the food is excellent. The staff is helpful and friendly. It was a great place to begin our journey in Morocco. Rus and Virginia",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2012,5,Paradise in Tangier,"Everything about this hotel was fabulous. We had booked a room with a shared bathroom, but since the hotel was pretty empty during our stay of 3 nights they gave us a free upgrade and were able to stay in a beautiful room with a private bathroom. The staff was always helpful and friendly. The breakfast was delicious and fresh, with a great view. The rooftop terrace is beautiful, allows for a 360 panoramic view of the city, water, medina! It was our first trip to Morocco, so at times it was a little overwhelming walking around as tourists, but we were always so happy to be able to come back to the little paradise that is Dar",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2012,5,Wonderful place!,"BEST PLACE EVER! The people who work there, especially Layton, are wonderful and very happy to help you in whatever way you need, whether it be a dinner recommendation or calling a woman to come do cheap and beautiful henna in the hotel (wonderful.) I wish we had more time to stay here, because it was an incredible experience. Definitely stay here!!!!!!!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2012,5,Felt like a princess,"We stayed three nights at the Dar Jameel in Tangiers. It was our first trip to Morocco and after taking the wrong ferry and landing 45 minutes away from where we wanted to be, we were a little taken aback by the medina when the taxi dropped us off. From the exterior, the neighborhood is .... interesting. However, when Mustafa answered the bell and opened the door to Dar Jameel, I felt like a princess. What a beautiful riad!. What a lovely room! What a nice breakfast! Most importantly, Mustafa, Idris and Layton were wonderful, providing lots of information, doing helpful research for us regarding the ferry trip back to Spain, arranging taxis, explaining bus schedules... and all with cheerful, friendly enthusiasm. Thanks for a wonderful introduction to Morocco!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2012,5,WOW!,"I never take the time to write reviews but here I am. I took a weekend trip to Morocco and after a horrible day with a walking tour. We were left to find our hotel by ourselves in a dirty parking lot. We climbed some steps got some directions and were taken to the best hotel in the world. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with kindness given amazing mint tea and finally relaxed. The staff is knowledgeable, professional, and took the time to help us find all kinds of amazing things to do in Morocco. Their advice was invaluable and the hotel itself is beautiful. It´s a quick walk from the Hotel Continental which is an easy find on the edge of the Medina and Dar Jameel is right around the corner with signs telling you how to get there. I loved our room and the…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2012,5,Castle in the sky,"Stayed for one night at Dar Jameel due to its convenience to the port and the price. It really did exceed our expectations. The decor seems a little frenetic from floor to floor, but it adds something to the charm of the property. The room was clean and comfortable, and breakfast was wonderful and served fresh when we were ready to have it. For us, the crowing glory was the very top terrace room with 360 degree views of Tangier.

 May 2012,5,"Excellent, highly recommended.","Took 14 friends with us while on a holiday in spain to tangier for the night, this place was perfect, hired nearly the whole place. The top room has incredible views, staff are 5star service quality, friendly and welcome. If your staying in Tangier i would highly recommend the Dar Jameel. Authentic, highly recommended. Wouldn't recommend Tangier for a long stay holiday, would definitely recommend Dar Jameel for your Hotel.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The hotel itself is gorgeousley decorated, very comfortable with many nice touches such as stereos with cd's, books for trading, lovely roof terrace with a glassed in room when to hot. The rooms have all one can need, and the external wc and shower still feel private as the hotel is small and personal. The 24hr staff were extremely nice and helpful. The breakfast was fantastic and the waiter serving the guests was five star. The breakfast surroundings and views were perfect. I would go back just to spend more time at this hotel.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2012,5,Medina living,"Wonderful, gracious and helpful staff. Comfortable rooms. Good breakfast. Our guide, Muscin (unsure of exact spelling) was a delight and I am sure that I would still be wandering the tiny twisting streets without him. If walking alone, you must run the gauntlet of neighborhood men waiting to ""guide"" so be ready. The breeze off the Mediterranean is heavenly.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2012,4,Diamond in a Rough part of town,"Th people in the hotel were awesome, they really went out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

If you are traveling with any women make sure they are appropriately dressed or else they will get allot of rude comments and allot of gawkes.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2011,5,"Loved Tangier, Loved this Riad, Loved our Guide!","Stayed here last spring for one night. The riad was lovely, comfortable and convenient. The staff couldn't have been more gracious and the breakfast was wonderful. The kids liked the rooftop terrace and game room at the very top. Mint tea on the roof in the afternoon with the spectacular view of the harbor, listening to the call to prayer felt like I was in a dream. Aziz St. Laurent was our guide for two days - highly recommend him too. I was unsure about Tangier, having read some negative reviews, but it was totally worth taking the ferry over from Spain for two days. We loved the Berber village of Asilah and also seeing Cape Malabata. There is something about the Mediterranean light in both these places - you will never see so many shades of blue in nature! I am…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2012,5,Amazing first night in Morocco!,"The hotel is in a great location, in the old Medina and it is easy to reach everything by foot. The staff is wonderful and they speak English, so makes the stay easier for people who do not speak French (which we found to be very useful throughout our stay in Morocco, despite only knowing how to form basic sentences). The place is beautiful, decorated in Moroccan style. The rooms are clean and tidy, also decorated and colorful. There is an amazing terrace on the top floor, from which you have 360 degree view - both of the beach and the medina. Breakfast was a great energizer for a day of touring, and the tea the staff will pepare for you throughout the day is simply delicious (love the fresh mint!) We fully recommend this hotel, you will have a wonderful time in Tangier.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2012,5,Definitely stay here when in Tangier!,"We spent two great evenings here in the family room and truly enjoyed the experience staying in a beautifully refurbished Dar. The common areas are especially splendid, with many details and colors to absorb. The light coming in through the courtyard helped shed light for the entire complex. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is very substantial. You can't go wrong here and in fact, it could be one of most unique places you can stay in.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2012,5,"Beautiful riad, friendly staff, great location!","We stayed here one night on a side trip from Spain. Being our first time to Morocco, we wanted to get the whole experience, so booked a suite at this traditional Moroccan guest house. We stayed in the Bergach suite, ground floor. It is the most traditional room. Lovely decor, big bed, nice bathroom. All of the staff is very friendly, and Layton provided us with a map, and directions, things to do/see, etc. Having the English speaking staff is a nice comfort in the zoo that is Tangier! Breakfast was wonderful, rooftop terrace, offers amazing views! We loved staying here, would recommend staying here, and would definitely return!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2012,5,A special place to stay,This is a great place to stay. We took a taxi from the ferry dock as we had luggage but it easy to walk there if you would rather- it is well signposted. From the second we walked in the front door we were amazed at the decor. The check in staff were very friendly and helpful throughout and greeted us with some lovely mint tea. I had booked this place to try and experience some authentic Morocco and it did not let us down. The decor is amazing throughout and the rooms were great too. Our Sheherazade suite was amazing- nice furniture and bathroom. The view from the roof is great- the harbour one way and the Medina the other and the sunrise from here was stunning. Breakfast was superb with great service from the staff and nice Moroccan food. Would definitely recommend this hotel…,Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2012,5,We'll be back!,"The Dar Jameel was quite a nice surprise! The hotel itself was beautiful with very high ceilings in the entry way. We walked straight from the port to the hotel and it was very close. The host was very nice and recommended a nice restaurant where we had dinner (it was obvious that the restaurant was for tourists, but that's what we are anyway! They had live music and very good food). The room was beautiful, very clean and comfortable. We had a private bathroom, but we had to leave our room to access it which wasn't a problem for us, but perhaps someone else might not be as thrilled. Breakfast was amazing, not very typical Moroccan, but none the less delicious and hearty. Breakfast is served upstairs with a nice view of the entire port. All the staff were very friendly.

 March 2012,4,Worth the effort,"When your new in any medina everything can be hard to find. Even Google Maps sometimes has trouble, though not in Tangier. The taxi drivers are able to find this place easily though. When we arrived we were quite anxious because it was dark and the entrance was located in what looked like a back alley. When we entered, however, we walked into a beautifully ornamented Riad with nice and clean rooms, hot running water and helpful and kind staff. The breakfast deserves special mentioning since it was excellent. Tasty and it varied by day. I would definitely recommend this Riad to anyone going to Tangier.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2012,5,Excellent and beautiful hotel with good access to the Medina,"This place is fabulous, as it is a little Tangerine jewel of a house converted carefully into a modern hotel. The tasteful traditional deco and high stucco ceilings are a delight. The legendary breakfasts on the topfloor with panorama of Tangiers bay are not overrrated in the reviews. The breakfast itself is worth a lot of praise. The staff is courteous and helpful. A document printing and faxing abroad was done for me with no extra cost. Wifi is working well and is free. Some claustrophobic people may suffer from few windows to the outside, but this is the Medina! Finally the price of 55 EURO/single is extremely good value.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2012,5,Tangier Trip,"Dar Jameel it's the perfect place to spend some days in Tangier. It's perfectly located (2 min walking from Petit Socco) and in a quite area despite being in the heart of the Medina. But this wouldn't be perfect without Dar Jameel great staff! Leyton, Idriss, Mustafa, and the rest of the persons (wich I don't know the name), treated me very well and I felt like home since first minute. The breakfast is great and the terrace is perfect spot to chill out a bit. Hope to return some day to Dar Jameel!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2011,5,Wonderful Riad,"This was the first time I had visited Morocco and was very nervous since I'm female and I was traveling alone. The staff at the riad made me feel extremely comfortable. I was impressed by their knowledge and was delighted by their hospitality. The architecture was absolutely beautiful, the breakfast was delicious, I felt incredibly safe and it was an overall great experience. In addition, they put me in contact with other females that were traveling and I made some life-long friends. Their mint tea is also fantastic. I couldn't have asked for more. It was a little more expensive than other riads I was looking at, but I'm glad I paid a little extra because I couldn't have asked for more. I want to send a warm thank you to the entire staff at Dar Jameel. :)",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2012,5,GREAT RIAD BETTER SERVICE,"We stayed two nights and the room was spectacular on entry and proved to be just as good as we thought. We had some problems with our ongoing bookings to Lisbon but Layton spent a lot of his time trying to help and offered us many options. This did not seem to be too much trouble nor did anything else.. The room was much better than we expected the breakfast was very good and we were able to get an early breakfast in our room to allow us to catch an early ferry, which in the Moroccan way was cancelled but the next service had been brought forward by an hour which we would have missed. Layton gave us some good directions to get around Tangier and where to find what we wanted.

We drove to Tangiers and our Sat Nav tried to route us to the hotel... got lost and stuck in the medina. Within a few minutes Aziz arrived and thankfully showed us the way. Layton and Aziz offered suggestions of where to go and where to eat and were wonderful, they even went out and bought cokes for us in the evening. The food was great and breakfast was huge. Well worth staying here and they will also collect you from the ferry terminal as the hotel is a little hard to find.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2012,4,Nice and comfortable guesthouse in a very convenient location,"I had a very pleasant stay at Dar Jameel. The staff (especially Mustafa) was exceptionally welcoming and knowledgeable - I felt comfortable in my surroundings right away. The guesthouse is located right on the fringe of the Old Medina and right by Hotel Continental (in case you need to give directions to the petit taxi coming from the bus or train station - I found that none of the drivers knew where Dar Jameel was or its street address), so it's very convenient for visiting the nearby souks. Tangier was one of our last stops in Morocco; and while Dar Jameel was a lovely stay (and yes, it does have THE BEST breakfast of any riads or dars we stayed at during our 3-week travel), its price was slightly more expensive as compared to our other stays, especially considering the bare…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2012,5,Great surprise!,"With just one night in Tangier before we flew home we literally just chose a place to stay at random.

 December 2011,5,"Treated like royalty here, will absolutely return!!!","AS others mentioned, do not judge this hotel by the outside appearance. It is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING on the inside. The mosaics, the colors, the peacefulness that surrounds you upon entering. We were welcomed by Mustafa at approximately 12pm, who was extremely kind and welcoming. He carried our four bags up to the 4th floor--there are no elevators here..all steps. As my father is older, he was not able to go up all the steps and asked if the room could be switched to one on the first floor. He happily made this possible. The rooms are nice, colorful and spacious. The bathroom is outside of the room--but you have 1/2 of the floor to yourself. The bedroom is strictly for sleeping. There are no TVs in the rooms..which coming from the US was shocking--but I really appreciated it at the…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2012,4,Convenient,"Driss, the manager, is a calm, collected, helpful and well informed person - multi-lingual too, which helps. The building is most original on the first two floors - intricate, fabulous tiles and high ceilings. The next two floors were added later and seemed a bit added on. We were four floors up...only stairs...great exercise. Our room included a bathroom; others did not. Careful when you book to make sure there are no surprises. Breakfast was good but I did not find it amazing as some have indicated. Location was great - 2 minutes from medina and 8 minute walk to port that connects with Spain. Boats connect to Tarifa NOT Algeciras but there is a free bus that will take you from T to A in about 15 minutes.

 October 2011,5,Don't judge this book by it's cover,"I was just about to apologize to my family for booking at Dar Jameel based on the outside appearance and its surrounding area until we entered. The decor was fitting for the Morocco and incredible beautiful. The room was both clean and comfortable for our family of 5. The staff was polite and helpful.

We were upgraded as our room had not been completely decorated and when we saw our very large bedroom - wow - what a lovely room. We each had a king size bed and sofas and a table and chairs and a sectioned off shower/toilet (not much privacy) but OK if you are very familiar with one another.

 October 2011,5,A little bit of heaven,"We booked this Riad on the reviews from Tripadvisor and I can say that I was not disapointed. We booked a ferry from Algeciras (Spain) for an overnight trip with Balearia Ferries (which I would not recommend, they are the most disorganised, unhelpful company I have ever traveled with. The Ferry also docks in the port of Tangier Med, which is 50km from Tangier. We should have got one of the fast cat ferries from Tarif which takes you straight into the port of Tangier) any way I digress. We were lead to our hotel by the Taxi drivers friend ""Steve"" (an unofficial tour guide) and taken through the medina past all his families shops.

The riad is beautiful, and the room we were assigned to was quite charming. We were fully prepared to pay full price for this room, knowing that we most likely wouldn't be staying there that night (we let the manager also know this). When we finally got in contact with our guide, he came quickly to Dar Jameel to pick us up.

 August 2011,5,the best place to be in Tanger,Dar Jameel is the best place to be in Tanger. Not only because of the location (near the Medina and with a superb view from the terrace) or because of the building itself (wonderful decorated) but most of all because of the staff: very friendly and very committed .

 July 2011,4,Great Place to Transition From Spain To Morocco,"We stayed at Dar Jameel for one night as we were transitioning from Spain to Morocco. After getting off the ferry, we followed the directions given by the hotel to walk to the accommodation. It was pretty straightforward, once we realized where the port ended and the rest of the city began! Overall, this was a great introduction to Morocco and the guesthouse was a calm and inviting space after the walk up from the port. Obviously, a lot of work was put into this guesthouse—the tile was just beautiful. The room we stayed in was Leila. It had a double bed, a small sitting area, a nice sized bathroom, and a terrific view of the port.

We were checked in Suite Leila which was very small but the manager was very kind to offer us Suite Malahat which was substantially larger and which we gladly took as we had travelled all the way from Thailand with 2 large suitcases. In our 2 week stay in Morocco, Dar Jameel probably offered the best breakfast with very nice local pancake freshly made. There are great views of Tangier from the rooftop. All in all a nice place which was recommended to us by La Tangerina who unfortunately was full for these dates.

While we found the city to be seedy, filled with aggressive hustlers and nothing to rave about, Dar Jameel was just lovely. The owner of the riad was very kind and hospitable. He greeted us with mint tea, went over the layout of the town with us and recommended places to eat, see and areas to avoid. It's authentic, yet beautifully kept up and at magic hour the most perfect light comes in through the skylight overhead. It was clean, very comfortable and easy to find/get to.

The young gentleman working when I checked out even walked me to the port, helping me with my things! Be sure to take advantage of the enclosed rooftop terrace----great veiws and perfect to watch the sunset. Breakfast is included in the price and is yummy---especially the Moroccan bread.

 March 2011,5,Love Dar Jameel,"Tangier as a city is OK - it's sort of seen its glory day and that's what is part of its charm. But Dar Jameel is truly a beautiful oasis in the city. You will have no clue what a gorgeous riad lies beneath the giant wooden doors. The tile work is so pretty and the staff attentive and kind. Request a suite with a private bathroom if you don't want to share... and the rooftop covered ""treehouse"" is so charming! The riad is pretty open so there's not a lot of privacy as far as what you can hear, etc. But as far as Tangier riads go this is the place to stay! It close to the port so you can get in and out of the medina easily. BEWARE though, a crazy freak hung out by a cafe near the riad and every time we saw him he screamed anti-semitic comments to us (neither of us are Jewish).…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

The family room was really lovely with gorgeous tiles and plaster work all over the ceilings and walls. The decor of the riad was stunning and our children loved the roof top with views overlooking the port and medina. Breakfast was delicious and the staff were delightful. All in all an extremely positive experience and I would highly recommend this oasis in the hustle and bustle of Tangier.

 January 2011,4,Respite from the city,"Great place to base yourself if it’s your first time in Morocco, as it was mine. I didn’t realize how much culture shock I’d have just getting off the boat from Spain, but the medina takes some getting used to. I loved Tangier, and Dar Jameel was a very nice, quiet place to come home to. Great rooftop views, comfortable beds and a good breakfast are bonus.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2011,4,A great place to stay,"We stayed here one night and really enjoyed it. It was clean, conveniently located in the medina but close for taxi services to airport, the staff were very friendly and helpful and a great breakfast on the roof-top terrace with great views. The decor is amazing and the room was very comfortable. Shared bathroom and toilet facilities was not a problem and all very clean. We recommend this Dar as a very convenient place and great value for money.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2010,5,Absolutely Fantastic Experience,"As you get off the ferry from Algeciras you are greeted by all manner of characters that look like they have stepped right out of a film set, walk a little further up the hill and you are greeted by open air butchers slitting chickens throats on the street – Welcome to Morrocco! But there is a gem hidden in this most Moroccan of Moroccan cities and that is Hotel dar Jameel – this place located virtually inside the medina stands head and shoulders above all other accommodation I’ve ever stayed in North Africa and really has to be seen to be believed. We booked through luxury-riads.com as they were by far the cheapest to be found anywhere but we would have happily paid the public price if no other option was available. Beautiful rooms, sterling service and wonderful food – an…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2010,5,A gem in the heart of the medina,"A beautifully maintained traditional building around a central well of light, with original wooden painted doors, ironwork and tiles - breathtaking on entry - sensitively modernized by the owners with many en suite bathrooms. It is incredibly clean, and the staff are very helpful, always available, and yet quiet and unobtrusive. There is a sitting room and sunny breakfast area (fabulous spread, the best!), and on the roof there are tables with a view of the harbour, and a glass sided room on top of that! The atmosphere is calm, quiet and friendly. While we were there a single woman arrived, a little nervous in Morocco, but with the guidance and support of the hotel staff, in particular the manager Dris, she was relaxed and had a wonderful time. You feel part of a family, and…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2010,4,Excellent for families,"We travel with a 7 months old baby and a child and to find an affordable, nice room to fit us all is quite hard. Dar Jameel was awesome. We had the Malabata room. It's big, spacious and very clean, and as a bonus, we had a kitchen nearby, so I could warm up baby bottle. We'll be definetly back next time. The location is also very good, very easy to find and withing minutes to the beach. Staff were also very extremely nice and helpful. Thank you all for a wonderful stay.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2009,5,Simply Palatial!,"Dar Jameel is simply palatial with the most wonderful service and hospitality I have ever experienced in any accommodation from hostels to hotels. I think many hosts/ hotel operators could learn a lot from Idriss who runs Dar Jameel. This Riad ticks all the boxes, it is immaculate and incredibly clean. The location is perfect, perhaps a little hard to find through the windy streets but we managed. Just don't let the hustlers bother you. They are relentless. We were stuck in Tangier for 3 days as the ferry could not operate under windy conditions. Dar Jameel at the time was fully booked and Idriss managed to squeeze us into a room that is not normally for guests. The next night when people left he had put us in another lovely room over looking the Sea at no extra cost. Prices…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2010,5,Dar Jameel is an unexpected architectural and visual treat run by a friendly and conscientious team,"I can't recommend this small friendly hotel more, for both it's beautiful ambience and the staff ( especially Idriss the manager) who do all they can to welcome you. We were two female travellers who felt very relaxed and well looked after here. The rooms are all stunning, with careful attention to detail and immaculately clean, and the large roof terrace is a great chill-out space with a 360o view over the old town and the sea",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2010,5,An oasis of rest in the hectic environment of the Tanger Medina,"I stayed with relatives at Dar Jameel and it is a fantastic place! Right in the middle of the busy and small alleys of the medina there's a big door to the beautiful place of Dar Jameel. Knock on it and the always kind and polite staff will open it to let you in. The place is even more beautiful than the photo's can tell! Breakfast is royal and the roof-terrace is lovely to sit at sundown. (Or at any other moment of the day). Could write a much longer review, but just go and experience it yourself! Greetings from the Netherlands!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2010,5,Fantastic friendly beautiful guesthouse - I wish we had stayed longer,"We arrived early morning to drop our bags and were given a warm and friendly welcome. The guesthouse is easy to find and has good views over the harbour. Breakfast was served in a lovely light and spacious room and I wished we had booked for longer and if I go back to Tangier, I will definately try to book again",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2010,5,my favorite hotel in the world,"this was my 3rd visit since they opened. the hotel has an ambience that is incredible...it is truly an oasis. they are doing so well that the lovely manager Idris now has minions running all over to help him with the delicious complimentary breakfast, opening the door for late night visitors, maintaining the impeccable building. i had the pleasure of meeting the owner & was pleased to congratulate him on his business acumen. idris even lent us the night watchman as a guide to the nooks & crannies in the medina that surrounds the hotel.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2010,5,Excellent service in an stunning atmosphere,"Dar Jameel is a jewel in the medina of Tangier and offered the best service during our entire trip (2 weeks). Located near to the ferry harbour it offers all amenities requied for an unforgettable stay. The rooms were very traditional, the staff extremely friendly and the atmosphere unique! We got all information about where to go and where not to go, maps and hints for moving around in Tangier by the staff. The rooms are very calm and the breakfast was just stunning! Best coffee ever and the crêpes and the fresh baken bread... Absolutely fantastic! Hint: don't let you guide by locals to the hotel as they will offer you a at least double distance walk through the darkest alleys of the Tangier medina... Call the hotel, they will catch you up at the harbour or wherever you'll…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2010,4,A tranquil relaxing hotel,"We spent 4 days at Dar Jameel and loved every minute of it. It was so peacefull and relaxing and just what we needed. Even though it was Ramadan and all the locals stayed up till the early hours of the morning this did not seem to matter but just added to the ambience of the place. Sitting up on the roof terrace at night was magical and it was also a great opportunity to meet fellow travellers and swop stories. The service was brilliant, especially at breakfast where you felt you had your very own personal waiter! We would definately stay there again on our next visit to Tangier.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2010,4,Views from the top roof terrace magnificent and owner/staff excellent,"The Riad is beautifully restored and although we arrived at 1am, they helped the taxi driver find it in the Medina. We stayed on two occasions, arriving and then leaving Morocco. The first stay bedroom was on the first floor and was good although the rooms on this floor have a shared bathroom which we did not expect. On the second stay we were higher up in a much larger room which was lovely and had en-suite. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was good and served in a small and attractive breakfast room. We were disappointed that the Riad did not have a Restaurant for dinner. The roof terraces are wonderful.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2010,4,"Boy, were we glad to see Dar Jameel!","Boy, were we glad to see Dar Jameel! This is truly a gem of a hotel in the middle of old town Tangier. We were met at the boat by an escort and a taxi to take us directly there, which was a great relief given the number of screaming guides and cabbies that wanted to take us to our hotel. We were able to both easily change money (which is not necessary, by the way) as we left with our escort and arrive at the hotel in peace. The best thing about this hotel is the hospitality. Everyone was so kind and generous, and they booked us a guide of the city for a very reasonable price, and he did a nice job. The second best thing is the rooftop. We spent an amazing Friday evening drinking wine, listening to the call to prayer, and watching the city go to sleep. The third great…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2010,4,Stunning Dar with attention to detail,"This is a beautiful kept, historical building. We loved the opportunity to spend a night there. Tangier wasn't our favorite city that we visited in Morocco but this was a wonderful hotel to come home to. Also, the breakfast room overlooks the sea and is very elegant. They helpfully arranged transportation to the airport as well.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2010,5,Beautifully renovated Riad and superb service,"After an eventful journey across the Med from Tarifa to Tangier it was just wonderful to arrive at the still oasis of Dar Jameel. The building is just beautiful and it was lovely to meet Idris the manager; such a kind and gentle man. We had a great night's sleep and awoke to a wonderful breakfast of local fruits, breads and coffee; such a joy to spend an easy morning looking out over the rooftops, the port of Tangier and beyond to the Atlantic ... against a backdrop of muezzins calling their faithful to prayer. After a great day wandering the streets of the Medina we returned for drinks on the roof terrace accompanied by squadrons of swallows putting on a fantastic aerobatics display above the crowded souks below - a perfect way to end the the day as dusk beckoned. Freshened…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2009,4,"Very beautiful inside, complicated location!","The hostel is very beautiful on the inside. Decorated with mosaics and bright colors, it is truly a beautiful sight. There is a nice rooftop sitting area that has a nice view of the city, and the rooms are clean, modern and comfortable. The location is a little confusing and hard to get to. It would have been helpful had the hostel provided a simple map.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2010,5,"Wonderful and exotic, totally recommended","Dar Jameel is a gorgeous ryad in an ideal location, just inside the medina walls so it's very easy to orientate yourself, you can easily go down to the waterfront where there are a range of cafes or deeper into the medina. This isn't a bland chain hotel so some aspects are a little 'quirky' but absolutely full of character and charm and a wonderful memorable experience. The decoration is exquisite. All the staff are very pleasant, perhaps a little shy but then so are we so if you're a more outgoing type then you'll probably engage more. The manager is very helpful and arranged for a taxi to pick us up from the airport. Good old Ryanair had our 1 hour flight from Madrid arrive 2 hours and 20 nminutes late so really we weren't expecting a taxi still to be waiting but a second…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2009,3,Okay for a one night stop over,"The place is beautiful, it had a decent breakfast, and reasonably friendy staff. By the time we made it to tangier on the train I was so warn out from talking and trying to avoid guys on the train trying to sell us stuff, then the taxi drivers hounding us, that getting to Dar Jameel was a relief. Though a beautiful place, the rough towels and hard beds gave a lot to desire, I was cool with the shared baths and new what we were getting, and they were clean and nice. Just not a place I would stay for an extended amount of time.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2009,5,A beautiful & serene place to stay in Tangier,"My husband and I spent one evening here while on a 24 hr visit to Tangier after spending several days in Spain. I was so impressed with all of the detail. We stayed in the Bergach Suite, which I knew was on the first floor, but I didn't expect the door to our room to be right in the lobby. Yet it didn't matter. I love Moroccan architecture and tile work, and absolutely loved our room. The bed was very firm, yet I had the most relaxing sleep! Idriss, the manager, was so friendly and professional (thanks for everything, Idriss!) He immediately connected us with Mustapha to give us a tour of the area. I strongly recommend getting a certified tour guide as there is so much we would have missed if we didn't have Mustapha to show us around. The next morning, we enjoyed a delicious…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2009,5,Dar Jameel is truly a delightful place!!!,"My wife and stayed at Dar Jameel while on our honeymoon. It was truly a delightful experience. Tangier can be loud and busy but Dar Jameel was always a quiet retreat. The staff was great! They were always very helpful and friendly. (Thanks, Idris!) I look forward to going back!!! Thanks!",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2009,5,A Jewel in the Medina,"We loved the place as soon as they opened the door and we saw the magnificent display of tiled light and color. We thought we were in an arabic palace! The tile work is as breathtaking as the Alcazar in Seville, Spain. The rooms were lovely, clean and quiet. The service was excellent. And Idris, the manager, was as kind and helpful as one could hope for. He volunteered to take us shopping and help us bargain for a Berber carpet, and when the taxis weren't running gave us a lift to the ferry in his own car. We had the two rooms with baths on the top floor with wonderful views, but it's a steep hike up several flights of stairs. Rooms were reasonably large and continued the beautiful Moorish tile motif. Mattresses were a bit hard and pillows a bit firm but didn't disturb…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2009,5,"""its so lovely it makes me want to cry"" said my 15 year old daughter","After a bus from costa del sol, a boat from Tarifa and a walk from the port we arrived rather hassled at the door of dar jameel we entered to peice and trabnquility like entering a different world. we had 2 adjoining rooms on the first floor and shared a bathroom. the breakfast room was so light and bright. We were bought mint tea on the roof terrace and for me it was the best mint tea I have had in morocco and we have been twice - reason being it wasnt sweet! sugar was provided to make it as sweet as each individual likes. Afte an exhausting journey we were all tired and grubby an didnt fancy eating out so a member of staff ordered us some food and we ate in the fabulous loft room overlooking the roof tops and satelitte dishes of the medina! Breakfast was plentiful and varied,…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2009,5,The truly best place to stay in Tangier - amazing Dar Jameel,"Where do I start?? Beautiful rooms. Friendly manager. Excellent breakfast. Cosy terrase, including a covered one if it gets windy. Perfect location. Many people say Tangier is not worth staying the night and that there are other more beautiful places in Morocco, but Dar Jameel makes your stay in Tangier absoluty worth your time.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2009,5,PERFECT choice for a stay in Tangier,"I was recently in Tangier for one night on a trip with 3 buddies of mine. Tangier can be an overwhelming city...esp. for those not familiar with the Arab world (and those used to the chill/relaxed mentality in Southern Spain). Staying at Dar Jameel was a perfect choice -- giving us the opportunity to go out an explore Tangier by foot (the guest house is close enough to all the action), while giving us a haven away from the intensity of it all. Dar Jameel's manager, Idriss, was VERY hospitable and friendly, and cooks up an awesome breakfast (fresh fruit, crepes, fresh OJ, etc.) We stayed in the Malabata room (2 king beds) and had plenty of space and our own bathroom...not to mention we pretty much had the entire place to ourselves so could use any bathroom throughout the place,…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2009,5,Very nice Hotel,"Myself, my wife and my 2 sisters stayed here for 1 night recently. Dar Jameel is utterly charming, in a great location, about a 10 minute walk to the port, and is spotless. The rooms are very large and most have pretty good views of the city. Idriss, the manager, is a fine man and did a wonderful job. The breakfast was delicious. Would stay here again without question.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2008,5,Tangiertastic!,"At the risk of sound redundant, this place was awesome! For the price, I can't think of a cooler place i've stayed at in Africa or Europe. It was fairly easy to find from the port (keep to the right up the hill, into the medina and right next to the Hotel Continental). We didn't even take a cab. We were greeted by the soft spoken, but very friendly care taker. He showed us to our room, gave us bottled water, and then sweet mint tea on the rooftop terrace (the coolest part of the place). The interior is a work of art, with beautiful mosaics and traditional arches. The roof gives you panoramic views of the entire medina (old Muslim quarters). Then a floor above the terrace is another room with big windows, couches, and heaps of old tapes for the stereo. All of it was a wonderful…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2008,5,Has to be seen to be believed.,"I visited this exceptional Riad in August, for an overnight stay, with my son and two grandsons. We booked 2 rooms via Costasur.com through the internet, which was a last minute booking. The Riad is within walking distance of the Port, although we took a taxi, and is very near to the Continental Hotel which boasts the original grand piano from the movie Casablanca, along with wonderful photographs. The Riad is very special, and we were made to feel very welcome by the Manager Idriss, who makes wonderful mint tea. Although on the edge of the medina itself, we felt very safe as there is a very thick entry door which is locked at all times. We had a family room with 2 double beds, and another room with one double bed. Both were of good size, but one criticism was there was no…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2008,5,Absolutely Amazing,"As this was my first time to Morocco, it was a bit intimidating getting into those taxis from the port and heading into the Medina. But Once we got to the Dar Jameel it was well worth the wait. The staff are very helpful and all speak english. The owner, Stephen, is a very nice guy who actually hung out with our group on the roof top sky lounge and ate some watermelon and listened to some music with us for a while. The lounge has the most incredible views the city has to offer. We sat up there all night, drink some wine, listened to music, and smoked hookahs! It was just a fantastic experience. If you actually want to go sight-seeing this is not the place to stay because you'll never want to leave the hotel :D",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2008,5,excellent medina house,"Just returned from a trip to Tangier, too much to see and do for one day. Dar Jameel proved to be an excellent base, well placed on the edge of the Medina, just across from the port. A quiet haven of tranquility, beautifully restored old town house. Our room (family of 4) was magnificent, complete with 4 post bed. All around the house there were oasis of quiet, sunny areas, topped off by an amazing roof terrace with a penthouse conseravatory area. Idriss (the house manager) could not do enough to help with any requests, his mint tea is perfection. He made our evening meal for us which was superb, enough for the four of us and more and breakfast the next day was second to none. We fully recommend a guided walking tour of the city, arranged by Idriss (we think the guide was…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2008,5,fantastic place,"stayed for one night on the way to fez. i cannot recommend this place enough. beautiful old riad very carefully restored, lovely breakfast, fantastically clean rooms with comfy beds and bedding. right in the medina. they honoured our stay with just an email. i'm surprised this place hasn't featured more in the guidebooks, but that was good for us since we could get in. best place we stayed in morocco.",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2007,5,Incredible Place - made a trip to Tangier worthwhile,"I cant praise this place highly enough. It's a morroccan riad re-imagined as a top class guest house - cum- hotel with facilities beyond the dreams of most budget travellers. Imagine a place where you take more photos of your hotel than you do of the destintion. It's that impressive. Extraordinary rooms, tiled with mosaics and centred around a covered courtyard, are only the beginning of what is offered. Theres a terrace with amazing views of the medina, a dining area, a chill out area on top of the building and a location which will turn the expectations of most visitors to Tangiers upside down. As a previous visitor to Tangier many years ago my view of the medina was of a place where Westerners should fear to tread. My experience at this place helped me to see through…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2007,5,What a gem,"A former palace this Riad is situated in a perfect spot close to the Port (you can walk to the Riad) in the Medina for shopping sightseeing and walking to the Kasbah and restaurants and within walking distance to the beaches. But the riad itself is gorgeous. The rooms surround a large interior courtyard decorated with original ceramic tiles and beautifully decorated plaster ceilings and moroccan lights. it is an oasis in the center of the Medina. The rooms are large with king size beds, light and airy with windows opening to the street and the interior courtyard. Breakfast was served on the second floor in another beautiful room and there is a roof terrace and a penhouse type sitting room where you can see the lights of the city and relax. There is also a lounge and other…",Dar_Jameel-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2007,5,Wonderful Riad,"This beautiful Riad is located in the Medina and is close to coast, souks and Kasbah. Typical traditional Moroccan Riad but as it was only converted to a Riad a couple of years ago it is very modern. Although the bathrooms are shared there is no worry as they were extremly clean at all times and modern facilities. The rooms are beautiful. Roof terrace has stunning views over the city and the africa and Europe coast. The staff were very helpful and the guy who owns it was always there to assist, he also speaks very good English. Breakfast was delicious and was served in the top floor dining area which has beautiful views. We only stayed here one night but wished it could have been longer!
