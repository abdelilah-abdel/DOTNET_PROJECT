 January 2023,4,Nice stay,"Our room was beautiful. There was a shared patio for 3 rooms. Breakfast was delicious. Very convenient to both port and city. Only negatives were couple in next room played music and talked on the patio very late. Also, the two men at the front desk spoke to each other very loudly all night.

 January 2022,5,Nice stay,"I highly recommand this hotel, the location is good, in the middle of the old city, close to the center and to the coast, it is safe a place.

 December 2022,5,Delicious breakfast and very friendly staff,"The breakfast was so delicious and the view from the breakfast room is very nice. Amazing and very helpful staff. Location is very good, in the middle of the old city, close to the center and to the coast. However hotel on top of hill, so number of stairs to climb.

 September 2022,5,"Great value, location and staff!","Mamora Bay was a GREAT experience for us. The location is excellent and the staff are above par. We arrived on a late flight at almost 2:00 in the morning. The staff at Mamora Bay organized a taxi for pick-up and the fellow was there waiting for us (this was after several changes due to a flight cancellation, and communication with staff was timely and clear). The cost for the taxi was a normal rate and not an overpriced rate - according to my cousin who lives there. We had two rooms with two single beds in them. Each room had working air conditioner and the shower had great pressure and hot water. Beds were quite firm, but I have heard that it is the norm. Breakfasts were wonderful and we made our poor server go back repeatedly for more coffees. He always served us with a…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2022,5,Nice stay in Tangier Medina,"Very nice location and available friendly staff, very nice welcome tea. The hotel is renovated and rooms are quite big for a couple.

They supervise the place ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2022,4,Really good value for money,"The staff in this hotel were lovely and very helpful. We arrived off an overnight train about 6 hours before check in. Our room wasn’t ready but they offered us somewhere to leave our bags and a complimentary breakfast. The man on reception gave us leaflets and advice on the local area. They also organised us a driver to Chefchaouen and sorted out our washing for a small fee, which was helpful as we couldn’t find a laundrette. Breakfast was hosted on the top floor with lovely views across the bay. Food was nice and included in the price. The service was spot on. The hotel is near the entrance to the medina, up a hill and some steps. There is also no lift, so wouldn’t recommend if this is a problem. Our room was cleaned daily and on one day they left some water and fruit…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2022,4,Good value for money & great staff,"Great location just inside the medina, close to port and local beaches/ corniche. Wonderful, friendly & knowledgable staff. Helped us book excursions & transfers. Breakfast was the same each day but at least you know what to expect! The room was fine, excellent aircon, views across the bay and mosque. Bathroom was very small. Overall, value for money, pleasant place to stay.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2022,3,A safe a nice place for a short stay in Tanger,Pros: right in the middle of the old town and when you get out you are already visiting and getting lost in the streets of the great market; very close to the port and easy to access walking after getting out your ferry (aproxim. 15min walking and it was our first time in Morocco) nice staff; very nice breakfast in an upper floor with incredible views for the port and sea; good value for money; clean; fruit and water in the room for free; Moroccan tea upon arrival for free and very good Cons: basic room and somewhat old; rather small bathroom; not readily visible or not the most easy to find hotel but that is the beauty of Morocco,Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 November 2021,5,Hotel Mamora,"I’m spending six nights here as a solo traveller before I live on to Casablanca. The room I have is reasonably priced, decorated well and clean. It’s all one could ask for. The team at the front desk of Tarik and Mohammed have been helpful, kind and attentive to the needs of anyone who has needed their help. They’re a calm and friendly presence. The restaurant offers a complimentary breakfast of local breads, eggs and fruit in a dining room with a view over the neighbouring mosque. The staff here, too, are friendly and take pride in their hospitality. To conclude, this is a charming hotel, well run by people who take pride in their work, and I wouldn’t hesitate to come here again the next time I come to Tangier.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2020,5,"Great location, great value!","My friends and I found this hotel to be the perfect fit for us. It is centrally located with great staff that are very helpful. They aided in arranging tours for us and answered any questions we had. The rooms are minimal, but they provide you with what you need. The free breakfast in the morning was a great way to start the day with an amazing view! Great place to stay for those looking to get out and around Morocco.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2020,5,Four Night Stay With Friends,This was a wonder hotel for me and my four other friends studying abroad!

Would definitely stay here again!,Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2020,4,Wake up with prayer,"Beautiful hotel and kind service. Overlooking the harbor at sunrise for breakfast is beautiful and can not be missed. The bathroom is one area, so no shower or division between the shower, toilet, and sink. We felt like the mosque leader was in our room singing us awake. Honestly, it was not that bad because we like being early risers any ways, but I would not recommend this hotel for families with young children or people who are grouchy in the morning. Great location and directly across from the #1 rated restaurant in Tangier.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2019,4,Good place for couple of nights,"Stayed here for two nights and the place was overall good. Staffs are helpful and location is nice, though you may have to walk a bit due to the location being inside the medina. Breakfast was could have been better, specially you don't want to drink packaged organce juice while you are in Morocoo!",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2019,4,Good location,"+ Cheap + Close to the port + Helpful staff + Clean + Good breakfast (included in price) + Good range of TV channels - Bathroom a little small - Right in the medina, so you might get hassled by touts - Wifi sometimes not available - Dinner options limited and pricey - No fridge in room",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2019,5,"Nice hotel, in the middle of the Medina","Nice hotel. In the middle of the Medina, near the Petit Socco and the harbor. The street of the entrance looks a bit shabby but inside everything is neat. Neat room, bathroom with towels and soap and shampoo. Everything nicely clean. Good WiFi. From the breakfast room on the 3rd floor overlooking the harbor. Good breakfast with an egg, a Moroccan pancake, fresh baguette and tea. Friendly staff, receptionist also speaks English and can arrange a taxi to the airport for the usual price (150 MAD). Hotel located right next to the Grande Mosque so at 5 AM you will wake up wonderfully with the prayer of the Imam. Excellent price / quality ratio. Recommended!",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2019,5,Excellent!,"This hotel offers an excellent quality at a great price. Furthermore, it is very well located in the centre of the medina, allowing you to easily explore the city and historical places. The staff is super friendly and always happy to help you, especially Tarik. He offered himself to keep a piece of ceramics I bought, which was too big to take with me in the flight, until I found a way to get it shipped to my home. Thanks for this Tarik!",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 April 2019,4,OK as a stopover,"We stayed here overnight while traveling from Fes to Madrid. The hotel is on the top of a hill and hard to reach, though you are rewarded with a nice view of the water once you arrive. Our taxi dropped us at the bottom of the hill, and we had to walk up and deal with a local who was insistent on helping us with our bags up the hill. He wasn't happy with the tip I gave him, and he hung out outside the door of the hotel, so we didn't leave the hotel until the following morning. The city has a bit of a rough vibe to it. Breakfast was good, and the hotel was fine for one night. I would, however, recommend staying overnight in Tarifa rather than Tanger if that is an option. We had a 5-hour ferry delay the next day before a 7-hour drive up to Madrid. While more a problem with…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 February 2019,3,"Mixed, not sure I'd return","Lovely clean hotel, really central in Tangier. The staff were very friendly but not very helpful. The WiFi wasn't working and the reception man just shrugged his shoulders and wasn't bothered. We had booked a room with two double beds however we were gived four singles so had to move beds around as our little boy moves slot and was worried about him falling out onto the tiled floor. The shower was shocking it was luke warm and not plesent at all. I was also a little disappointed knowing we had a two year old they allocated us a room facing the cafe / communal area and we were rudely awoken at 1.30am by a group of people shouting and chatting. Breakfast was nice however they have no concept of time, it states its served at 7.30 however they weren't ready until 7.50am which was an…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2019,3,Amazing view of the bay.,The staff is very friendly and the rooms are clean. Our only downfall would be the lack of hot water and the fact that the internet WiFi didn't work inside our room. Apart from that the breakfast view was breathtaking.,Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2018,4,"Clean, for reasonable rates Hotel in Tangier","I was looking for a cheap Hotel for one night before my departure from Morocco. Mamora Hotel location, to me was the best solution to see Medina, and go to the airport. The staff is fluent in english, francaise and arabic, which is very helpfull.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2018,1,Don’t go there!,"I spent 2 nights at Momora hotel in Fes: one of my worst experiences in Morocco! My room was really basic: large enough to contain a bed and a plastic armchair and coffee table, that’s it! Impossible to open completely the bathroom’s door because there wasn’t space enough; no shower tray; no space to put your toothbrush; 1 towel for 2 people; NO BED SHEET, just a duvet on the bed: a place to forget!",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2018,5,Nice clean Hotel,"The staff were very good, they met me at the Main Square and guided me to park my car, since the hotel is in the old town with very narrow streets. The room was clean and quite large, with good en-suite shower.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2018,3,Good staff,"I wanted a cheap room in Tangier as I was likely to just want an hour in there to freshen up on arrival and about 3 hour’s sleep before an early departure to the airport. The room had a single bed and a small sofa. The bathroom was like a wet room with the WC and wash basin effectively in the shower! There was no aircon so you need to have the window open and it is very noisy outside (even at 1am). Fortunately, I was very tired. However, at £24 for the night I think the room was fairly priced and it suited my requirements plus the staff were very pleasant and helpful.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2018,4,Very Helpful Staff,"Even though the access with bagagges is a bit difficult, the location is in the city centre and the staff is extremely nice and helpful, ready to speak any language and with a lot of good recommendations, such as the restaurant kashba. The breakfast was complete and different every day. The staff at the restaurant was very really helpful and friendly.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 July 2018,5,Good Value,"Hotel Mamamora This is a nice affordable place to stay close to the Ferry crossing from Tarifa. The hotel is located in the Medina and is very welcoming.

Good value.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2018,2,Seen its best days,"Me and my dad stayed here for one night during our trip to Tangier. Pros: friendly staff, central location in the Medina, cheap price, Wi-Fi. Cons: scruffy, seen its best days, location next to the mosque (good luck trying to sleep), bathroom floor was constantly wet (apparently there's a leak), no AC, smoking allowed in the breakfast room, no reading lights, view to a dirty backyard, door lock difficult to operate.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 July 2018,4,Loveliest staff!,"This places was a nice little oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the Main Street. The rooms were clean and decent. The head bar/ restaurant host was amazing! Hali (I think that’s how you pronounce his name) was extremely accommodating and friendly. As I was vegetarian he made a special effort to organize different meal options every night especially for me. He also ran up the road to get me some sparkling water after I had asked if they had any. There is also a very lovely and knowledgeable reception staff member. An older middle aged man (I can’t remember his name) He was a great help when we needed to organize any transport, tours or just wanted some general information about Morroco.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2018,4,"Good staff, nice view, perfect location","We had an small and nice room, the bathroom was a little bit tiny. The view, especially at the breakfast, was amazing and the atmosphere there very relaxing. The staff was extremely nice and helpfully. The location of the hotel is perfect inside Medina, the center of the old city. Nearby you will find an amazing Maroccan restaurant (downstairs) and many shopping possibilities.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2018,4,Nice hotel inside Medina,"Hotel Mamora was a nice hotel but nothing spectacular. It is located in the Medina, near the popular Petit Socco and Grand Mosque. As a result of it's location, it can get very loud at night. We visited during Ramadan so the streets were very loud and crowded until very late in the evening. The rooms themselves were very average. The shower did not work in our room but it was clean and the bed was comfortable.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2018,2,„Experience“ of the nightly muezzin‘s call,"Positive highlight is the mostly friendly staff and the view from the restaurant over the harbor. BUT ... The muezzin mosque is really close, only about 50m, which is really loud at night. Also the hotel is quite noisy. It isnt very clean there. Very small bathroom, which is completely under water while showering. There was no sheet for the blanket in the bed, luckily we had our own sleeping bags with us. The next morning no room service was performed, the toilet paper was not refilled. The breakfast is quite one-sided, no fresh fruit or vegetables. The orange juice tastes very artificial, compared to the freshly squeezed juice that is found everywhere else in Morocco. Included is only a small cup of coffee, each additional one must be payed extra. We had booked for two nights…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2018,5,In the middle of Petit Socco,"Gorgeous place to stay if you want to feel, taste and smell the middlepoint of the Medina. Good hotel and ultra friendly staff. It is noisy till late in the night on the street below, but you have to experience that as well. Would recommend this hotel, but we were lucky tho have a room on the top floor. We could see the medina over the rooftops and the sea from the restaurant, where the kids would sit to have good access to the wifi/internet",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2018,5,Great hotel and location,"A group of five of us booked two rooms here to chill out whilst in tangiers for the day, this is a great location and totally safe, with excellent staff and WiFi, the rooms were big and clean and it is within easy walking of all the old attractions One thing to mention is that most of he ferries now go to the new port so you will need a taxi to tangiers as it’s 50 k from the new port Would recommend to all my friends and I would defiantly stay again",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2018,1,Cancelled 4h before my ferry,"After confirming time of arrival with the hotel, 2h later I received an email from booking.com indicating that my room was no longer available and that I had to find somewhere else to stay. All this 4h before my ferry trip to Tanger from Spain. Unacceptable",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2018,4,A solid choice in the old city...,"Though it looks in a dodgy neighbourhood of the old city, the hotel itself is modern, neat, tidy, clean, and has elegant furnishings.

Staff are friendly and always smiling - I had no issues here.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2018,5,"Great, surprising find","I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Tanger and wanting to stay in the médina. It was very easy to find upon entering the médina and the customer service is great. My one-bedroom room was in perfect condition and extremely clean. The bathroom was impeccable. There is good wifi and the free breakfast is delicious, especially the espresso. Overall, the hotel is beautifully decorated and everyone working there is helpful. My only ""complaint"" is that it's right next to a mosque, so if you don't want to be woken up at 5am for prayer, this maybe isn't the best choice. You might be able to ask for a room furthest away if possible.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 February 2018,5,Recommended budget hotel in the medina,"Apart from the soundproofing, this hotel is perfect. Central location in the medina, professionally managed, very clean, correct breakfast with great views, good wifi, cable TV, ... Good price for single guests too, for a large room. Off season, choose a hotel in the medina or in the commercial center anyway. Not in the beach area.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2018,1,Just disappointing,"We stayed in this hotel for 1 night and it was enough. We got off the taxi from the bus station and a man took us by the hotel telling us he works for them. It wasn’t true and we were forced to pay him, while the receptionist was looking at the scene saying nothing at all. And the receptionist wanted us to take a taxi for the port paying 500 dirham (50euros) while we payed 200 for the same trip. Then the room was tiny and there weren’t enough towels for the two of us. In the bathroom there was no space to have a shower, it was so small. In addition, during the night it was very noisy. We had to leave to take the boat and the breakfast was not ready for us even though we had it included and we had said to the guy the day before. Not appropriate for the Price and we didn’t feel…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 October 2017,4,Right in the heart of the medina & a good value,"It is not fancy, but is clean and they offer a nice breakfast with a nice view.

 July 2017,2,No REAL Air Conditioner,"Travelling to Morocco in summer means it's hot. I booked this hotel on the advice in booking.com that it has air conditioning. Having had other similarly priced options with air conditioning, I was annoyed that their definition of air conditioning meant a portable air conditioner that did NOT provide any cooling, but acted as a giant fan that had water inside it. This made for very terrible night's sleep, with the room being stuffy and no option to open the windows, because no fly screens meant spending the night with mosquitoes. So unless you can deal with heat very well, then don't bother booking this in summer. The room is spacious with high ceilings. It's clean and has a bed that is ok in comfort. The bathroom has the shower open, which means that water will go everywhere…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 May 2017,2,Skip this one ...,"Cons: Staff couldn't even recommend a good restaurant nearby. I asked for a late checkout (by 10 minutes) and was told it was ""not possible."" Took me four days to get them to bring me tea with milk in it for breakfast. It is located right next to the mosque, and the calls to prayer were LOUD. It is in the medina, so taxi cannot drop you off in front of the hotel. Pros: Great view from the roof terrace. OK breakfast. Big fluffy towels.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima

 May 2017,4,Great location and good breaksfast for low price,The location of this hotel is great. It's right in the medina but close to the beach as well. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The room was large but mine didn't have a view expect into a room across the street. There was no AC but the temperature in May was fair enough without it. The shower does have really hot water if you give it about 5 minutes. The breakfast is good and the mint tea is excellent. The wifi worked well. Overall it's a good choice if you like the location and are on a budget.,Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2017,5,We stayed a week,"We used Tangier as a rest spot after 3 long weeks of travelling around Morocco. We booked this and stayed the week easily.. I could have stayed another.

 April 2017,5,Hidden Gem,"The location is hard to find has to be accessed via unfamiliar winding roads, the hotel is extreamly clean with super friendly staff. I paid £40 for 2 nights with breakfast. Close by within walking distence there are numerous outlets for food ranging from traditional Moroccan cusine to olive filled baguettes. as well as shops for fancy goods. Walk up and you have access to drop down to the promenade and turn right about 1 km there is the Gelateria cafe or Panorama cafe near to McDonald's.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 April 2017,5,"The best hotel for this price in Morocco, what I've seen","I think, it is the best hotel for this price in Morocco. I've seen more then 20 hotels in Tanger, Fes and Chefshauen for 20-25 euro. This hotel is very clean and comfortable. The breakfast is simple, but tasty. This hotel is near from mosque, you will hear a prayer in the morning. But if you are tired, you'll sleep in this time) The personal of hotel is very welcoming. I recommend this hotel, when you come to Tanger.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 January 2017,3,The best is the view,"The rooms are fine, nothing special but good enough. The guys in reception were quite helpful, but the one that served breakfast not so much (and he didn't speak a word of English).

The best of all is the wonderful view of the town from the breakfast area. Good value for money.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2016,5,Brilliant gem in central location,"We were led to this on foot by a local. Amazing find. The approach is a bit suspect, (no threat really, but different) Step inside the beautiful traditional doors and it's clean with very accommodating staff. We stayed 3 nights and wanted to stay longer. Breakfasts in the enclosed roof dining area give wonderful view over mosque roof and Tangier harbour though our room had no view, am I bovvered? No, I'm on holiday!! I found call to prayer 4am and 7am from the mosque next door rather soothing tbh, will irritate the neurotics. Staff excellent, professional and very polite, so tip them a lot!!!! Lovely people. The chap on the desk who looks like he is from Fez is amazingly exemplary. Take coins for beggars and doggy bags with spare food for the street dogs and cats…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 November 2016,3,Cheap for a reason,Cleanliness was poor although it seemed ok in terms of hygiene but it's never pleasant to find red stains on the bed sheets and large orange stains on the towels.

 April 2016,5,Great restaurant in a wonderful Hotel,"We have just returned from a three days trip to Morocco, Tangier & Assilah. Our stay in Tangier was a 1 night stay which we thoroughly enjoyed. The restaurant is in keeping with the atmosphere and feeling of Morocco! We took the morning ferry from Tarifa and were met by our private guide that took us around for the day on a wonderful tour of Tangiers highlights. We had dinner in the Mamora hotel in the Arabic restaurant where bellydancers perform while we ate dinner!! Our rooms were very clean and we had asked for a sea view, I must admit that the view at night is especially enchanting. Tangier is an education and is fascinating to visit. Highly recommend the Mamora Hotel for a visit to Tangier!!",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2014,4,Great for the money,"A friend and I stayed here a couple of nights while in Tangier. The rooms were basic, but very clean. The hotel is located next to a mosque, so we were awoken each morning for the call to prayer. The call lasts about 5-10 minutes each day and it is pretty annoying if you are not one that needs to be called. You may be able to ask for a room that is further away from the speakers, we were right next to them. We paid extra for a private bathroom, but there was no hot water in the shower in the room. The public shower had regular hot water and was conveniently located just across the hall from us. I seemed to have difficulty getting steady hot water in the mornings, but my traveling companion said her shower was excellent in the afternoon/ evening. Staff here were very helpful.…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2014,4,Fantastic budget accommodation,"I think ppl need to remember that this is budget, not 5 star. Mamora was quite possibly the best budget accommodation we had during 7 weeks in Morocco. 140dh for a double room with shower and shared toilet. V clean and light. Hot water from 8-12 each morning. Great location in the medina. Yes it looks a little dodgy but thats the area in the medina in general and really just Tangier! Staff were helpful and friendly. I would take previous bad reviews with a grain of salt.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2013,3,Marmora hotel Tangier,"No wifi, friendly staff, very creepy entrance especially at night. At walking distance from ferry terminal. No towels so bring your own, no hot water. Right next to a mosuq, so you will be waking up at night because of the call for prayer. Rooms are cleaned everyday. Hostel is in the medina.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2013,1,Threatening thieves,"We wanted to stay in hotel mamora in tangier because the writeup was nice in the Lonely Planet. We wanted to pay right away and the receptionist stole 200 dh (~22$) of our change, claiming that he had given it to us. We insisted that he didnt and that he can review video footage if he wants. The receptionist started swearing in the name of God that he gave us the money, and two of his comrades that were nearby but did not witness the money exchange, started attacking us and how dare we question the receptionist. We did not back off and soon they started threatning that we would be beaten up!! We left the place, managing to extract 100 dh of our money after we threatened we would call the police. We ended up staying at another hotel, but living in fear that their threats would…",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2013,3,Not bad at all! Good value,"Centrally located, right in the medina. Rooms are basic but clean and there's even hot water! Shared toilets could be cleaner but for the budget traveller this is acceptable. Personnel at the reception was friendly. Nothing special but a fair place to spend the night in Tangiers. One thing; Our window was right next to the speaker of the neighbouring Mosque (waking us up around 4am in the morning every day). Oh well, that's part of the deal (&charm) in a islamic country right? ;)",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 August 2012,4,Fair Hostel for an interesting price!,"It is a cheap hotel: 200dh for a double room per night. Rooms are clean and quite big. Shared Toilette (toilette paper not always available!). Quite chaotic since it is near a mosque and in the heart of the medina. Good for one or two night stay for ""easy people"".",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 March 2012,5,A hidden gem,"I'm giving this hotel a 5 star rating for the way in which they dealt with the various street hawkers etc who follow you home; walking through the door is an oasis of peace and safety. It's not a bad hotel, good spacious rooms and very clean. Also, the location of the hotel means that you can literally walk out the door and be in the eye of the Tangier storm in seconds! We had breakfast on a corner cafe and had most meals in a lovely wee restaurant a couple of doors away. I have very fond memories of it - handy too for the ferry from Spain.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 October 2011,3,IN THE MIDDLE OF MEDINA MAYHEM,A bit like a boarding school! Large non-en-suite rooms with quaint furnishings. Room 35 catches the full blast of loudspeaker announcements from the adjoining mosque. OK for a night or two - nothing special.,Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 May 2011,4,In the heart of Tangier Medina,"I stayed at Hotel Mamora for one night with my wife. It is located in the Medina, which may be advantage for some people and for some not. It may be noisy at night because of pabs outside the window. It is close to the port and CTM bus stop, next to the city beach. I must say it is a really good place to stay. Rooms are big with a comfortable big bed, but a bathroom (with only a shower and a sink) was very small. Toilets are on the corridor. Water wasn't hot, just warm. But it was acceptable. We paid 200MAD for a room. Room was quite clean as for Moroccan conditions. Personnel speak English and is very helpful.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 December 2009,1,Overestimated and disapointing,"We stayed here for one night during winter holidays. Then left after the firtst night. The room was large but not well kept and rather dirty, so were the corridors. The whole smelled , so the window had to be kept open. There was a shower and sink in the room. Promised hot water in the morning wasn't there. Toilets on the corridor were also not inviting but ok. Though the paperholder was broken. So we took the paper to the room everytime. There was no breakfast. Though built into the medina, the room had a window with a nicish view over a mosque and on the fright harbour. Staff was uninterested and not willing to give a discount for the unheld promises of hot water and cleanliness.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 June 2009,3,A great value for a great location.,This is a no frills spot right at the entrance of the Tangier Medina right as you are entering from the side nearest the port. The staff was very nice and showed us two rooms to choose from. The shared toilet was no problem and for one or two nights I think this hotel is a great way to save some money when you get to Morocco. A pleasant surprise considering my first impression of the place!,Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
 September 2008,4,Very Friendly Staff,"As a single American woman travelling alone in Morocco, I was very happy with my stay at the Hotel Mamora in Tangier. Don't expect anything fancy, it's not at all glamorous. But, it's clean, comfortable and located right in the middle of the Medina. Some rooms don't have their own bathrooms, so make sure you ask for one if you want it. The price was great, about 250 dh ($30-40) for a double room. The desk staff were friendly, helpful and informative (although their English wasn't spectacular, French is a safer bet.) They had a luggage storage room which was great, so I could leave my stuff while I went exploring. One downside.... the minaret of the neighboring Mosque is RIGHT next door, so the calls to prayer will wake you up.",Mamora_Bay-Tangier_Tanger_Tetouan_Al_Hoceima
