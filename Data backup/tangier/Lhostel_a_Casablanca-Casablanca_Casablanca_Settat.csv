 October 2022,1,Lots cats lots poop,"If you value cleanliness dont stay here. Cats everywhere especially around the food: in kitchen, on the floor, by the stove. And had cat poop right outside our door. Asked for a refund and the guy front desk had no idea what was going on. said owner was in France. I said take off credit card he barely spoke English. Said would mail money never got. Felt scared coming here at night and middle no where. The pictures they show are not even close get in the room. No sheets. I know low end but strange place.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 May 2021,5,Gorgeous hotel,"My husband and I are staying at the hostel and plan on extending our stay for an additional week here. The owners of the hotel are wonderful people. The owners and the staff were welcoming and helpful at our arrival. The property is nicely kept and has a beautiful garden. Our bedroom is spacious & clean. The breakfast is wonderful. They offer many choices such as sweet pastries, local breads, slices of meat, eggs, fresh fruits, fresh orange juice, coffee, and much more. The hotel is perfectly located, not far from the tramway and the train station. We did couple day trips to nearby cities such as Rabat (an hour trim ride from here and the trip was very cheap). I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying a few days or transiting through Casablanca.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2022,5,"Clean, safe and close to airport","This guesthouse was the perfect first night in Morocco for me. Cheap and easy to get to from the airport even when operating with no sleep or French! (50dirhams train ride, first stop, plus a 5-10 min walk) Staff offer a warm welcome and all parts of the property are kept spic and span. Big chain supermarket for snacks is located 2 blocks away.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 September 2022,3,"Beautiful Hostel, however no Airport Pickup","Stayed here one night travelling through. I was supposed to be picked up by a taxi arranged by the hostel but we did not manage to find one another a the airport, even though I spent one hour trying to find the driver. Arriving at the hostel (with another taxi), the night portier was pretty dissatisfied that I had not found the taxa driver; and did not give any help as to how the hostel operated (wifi, breakfast etc). So did not feel much welcome going to sleep. The next morning I met the rest of the staff, which was very kind.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2022,5,Lovely,"only 5mins walk from casa d port train station, good room, good bfast with reasonable rate. They have few options for the room, either you wanna have a bunk bed with random mates or private room. They provide kitchenette in case u wanna have your own bites.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2022,5,Lovely place to stay at for a fair price,"Lovely place to stay for a fair price. A beautiful villa, very quiet place for those who want to enjoy peaceful time. The yellow room is equipped with proper air conditioning and a very comfortable bed. It lacks a wardrobe and bathroom entrance is via hall, though it is clearly seen on the photo of the room and in regards of the bathroom entrance is also stated on the website, so all fair and should be no problem. The only thing to put me off was the constant bad smell in the bathroom which required the windows to be opened at all times. The things to balance it all out and bring the experience to be great was the outside of the villa, which was very beautiful and the outdoor dining area is stunning, with blooming flowers and lots of cosy things around to bring it a unique…",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat

 October 2019,3,"Beautiful place, but unfriendly staff and construction noise next door.","The interior is beautiful with lovely kitchen and living space, but overall they were very unfriendly and the construction noise hard to handle so early in the morning. Additionally, I asked for the shuttle service they offered and they said no problem. On the morning before my arrival I messaged to confirm the shuttle would be there and again later in the afternoon, the message was marked as read but no one bothered responding. I arrived at the airport and waited 15 minutes to see if a driver would show but no one was there, so I called the hostel and the gentleman who answered acted as if he had no idea what I was talking about, but 15 minutes later a driver arrived. The driver was very nice and friendly. Subsequently, upon my arrival at the hostel when the gentleman who…",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2019,5,Friendly atmosphere,"This place is super convenient. The owners are very customer oriented. You feel like home. Home made breakfast, nice decorations and centered location. The rooms are very clean. There is a nearby train station which made my journey to the airport very smooth. It is highly recommended.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2019,5,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"Firstly, this hostel is stunning, very beautiful architecture and decorations. Home made breakfast was absolutely delicious and we enjoyed the variety offered - especially the freshly squeezed orange juice and fresh fruit. The best part about this hostel was the incredible service and hospitable nature of the owners and staff. I had an issue with my suitcase and the owner kindly helped me repair it. He went above and beyond to assist me and I am so grateful. Thank you very much for having us!",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 June 2019,4,Convenient,"This is a nice and good value place to stay. It is conveniently located within walking distance of L'Oasis train station which connects to the airport and Marrakech and within walking distance to the tram which takes you to the city and beach. But it is in a unattractive neighbourhood but the front gate is always locked. The gardens are lovely and you can have breakfast here or sit here in an evening with the free wifi. The breakfast is buffet style consisting of different teas, coffee, crepes, pastries, bread, boiled egg, different hams, jams and fresh fruit juice. The French couple who own it are friendly.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 April 2019,5,"Peaceful, cozy stay in beautiful property","L'Hostel was just what I needed after three nights at a work-sponsored residential workshop. Not far from the centre, but far enough so that it's quiet and peaceful. Good connections nearby, with L'Oasis station a short 10-minute walk away, from where you can take a train and be at the airport in 30 minutes. The beautiful seating area where you can relax with a book and enjoy the sunlight earned me the most comments I've ever had on an Instagram post! And it really is so beautiful, I just sat there and marvelled at the tiles. A good variety of breakfast items, and a nice little outdoors seating area to enjoy the sun and cats. It really felt like I was staying in someone's home, which made the experience all the more enjoyable. Would definitely stay here again.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 December 2018,5,Roomy and comfortable,"The house is huge, with comfy dorms and beds. I even believe the matresses were quite new when I was there. The staff is very helpful, always ready to answer your queries and help you navigate the city. The location is good for the ones coming from the airport, since it's about 5 blocks away from train station L'Oasis. Oh, breakfast is also worth it!",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 November 2018,5,Amazing and beautiful,"The place itself it's amazing, it has all Moroccan style. The staff are very helpfull and kind. I just loved it. I strongly recommend, the breakfast it's good too, it has a traditional Moroccan tea..and yogurts.",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 October 2018,4,It was overall a short but great stay in a gorgeous hostel just outside the city.,"Even though our stay in Casablanca was extremely short, we were really impressed with this hostel. It was outside of the main part of the city, which was exactly what we wanted, and tucked away on a nice quiet street. We ended up parking on our car on the street (and felt comfortable doing this) because we were planning to leave really early the following morning but there is ample parking available inside the gate. The hostel was beautiful and modern and the grounds inside the gate were well-kept, with some chairs to sit and relax. Our room was nice and had everything we needed for a few hours of sleep. We had a shared bathroom (very clean) with our floor mates but didn’t run into any problems. The only small issue we ran into is that we couldn’t find a remote to turn down…",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 August 2018,4,Great cost x value!,"Delicious breakfast, kind and cool French owners, great attention to details (from the toilet to the bedding) everything surprises you because of its fair price. The only I could find with such price. Congratulations!! I super recommend",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
 July 2018,4,Nice stay in new hostel,"I did like my stay in l'hostel. The owners, a French couple were very friendly and helpfull. They spoke English as well. I stayed two nights in the dorm on a brand new, large enough matress in a clean, nice room. The breakfast was also really okay, and there was a nice terras. It s quite a walk to the centre, but there s a tram nearby, who takes you to the beach, the city center, the station, ...",Lhostel_a_Casablanca-Casablanca_Casablanca_Settat
