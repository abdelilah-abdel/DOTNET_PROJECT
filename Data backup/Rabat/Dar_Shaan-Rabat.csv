 November 2022,5,Great place and friendly staff!,A beautiful riad in the medina with very friendly staff. Good breakfast and restaurant and large rooftop area with a small swimmingpool and a view over Rabat. Highly recommended for a stay in Rabat!
 December 2022,5,Dar Sháan the beautiful,"An absolutely amazing experience in this peaceful, cosy, clean and beautiful Medina Villa with a perfect location in Rabat. This wonderful place had all the comfortabilities you can expect and it was very price worthy. The staff is very friendly and helpful in all ways. The breakfast was really good with very nice omelettes. I would recommmend to update the WiFi as it was a little slow and irregular. Furthermore, if you can offer some tourist maps it would even be better than five stars :-) But overall, we would not hesitate one second to stay with you again. We will definetly recommend you to our friends and colleagues. Best regards/"
 October 2022,5,Sophisticated Riad,"They even had an elevator to the rooftop pool! This place was much like a European B&B. Bathrooms were a bit fancy. Food was also ""a step up"" from some of the other places we had stayed. Locations was also very good, as they were right by the gate. Staff went out of their way to arrange an extra bed for us and also arranged our transport to Casablanca. Highly recommended."
 November 2022,5,Wonderful stay in Rabat!,Dar Shaan is an amazing riad. It's beautiful and the service is terrific. The staff arranged airport transfers for us to and from the Casablanca airport. This made our travel so easy. We had dinner here and the food was top notch! Don't miss the loaves at breakfast. They're delicious! I would highly recommend Dar Shaan. I loved my stay here.
 October 2022,2,Not nearly as good as the rating leads you to believe.,"Out of all the Riads we stayed in during our two weeks in Morroco, this was the worst. It had tiny rooms, wasn’t very clean, to the point we requested a cleanup before using it. I suspect ratings are rigged. It couldn’t be that out of over one hundred reviews, this is the only one with low ratings."
 November 2022,5,"Luxurious, modern yet traditional Riad in the heart of Rabat - absolutely perfect for a quick getaway!","We visit Morocco on an annual basis from London, UK, and this time we opted to stay in a Riad for a change for a more unique experience and this Riad did not disappoint. The best way I can describe it that it felt 'boujee' luxurious in the feel of the place and felt modern while still keeping a traditional feel throughout the property, very well kept. The bedroom was a good size, comfortable bed, and good clean bathroom with good pressure on the shower, makes all the difference! We needed directions to a local mosque and prayers times, all of which the young man readily helped us with, thank you Sedik at reception! Also Fatine made reservations for our evening dinner at 'Dinarjaat' which was a couple of minutes walk from the Riad, again she was really helpful and happy to help.…"
 September 2022,5,What a welcome to Morocco!,We arrived late at night and it was our first stop. We were totally excited to find ourselves in this beautiful riad which has both a sense of history and modern design. The staff were very welcoming and even served us dinner at 11pm at night. Sadly we had to leave the next morning and couldn't enjoy the beautiful courtyard or rooftop swimming pool. Would love to back to Rabat and would definitely stay at Dar Shaan.
 October 2022,5,"Idyllic Accommodation, Excellent Location","We LOVED this riad, which is located inside the medina yet easily found and with superb accessibility. The property is very tastefully renovated in ‘modern Moroccan’ style, with cozy sitting areas throughout. The rooms are all uniquely furnished and accessorized - like being in a home decor magazine! They offer a very nice breakfast in a lovely dining room, and the staff couldn’t be nicer or more helpful. In particular, Sadeek shared great recommendations for shopping, sights and getting around Rabat. We will most definitely stay here again on return trip, as this property really helped make our visit to Rabat memorable."
 September 2022,5,Fantastic Riad,Location is only about 5 minutes walk to beach. Central in Medina but still the rooms are very quiet Staff are excellent. Very friendly and great service The room was fantastic. Unique decorations clean. Plenty of space. Great amenities Not good if you struggle with stairs as bathroom was on a mezzanine floor. I would highly recommend this Riad.
 October 2021,5,"Amazing staff, fantastic rooms and terrific location!","Loved our week here - everyone bent over backwards to make sure we had a wonderful time...it is always the staff that make the stay...and they were terrific. Plus awesome food, breakfast and dinner, wonderful room (quiet). Great place in the Medina...will definitely stay again!"
 November 2021,5,One of the most beautiful Riad in Rabat,"Close to the ocean , in the Medina , gorgeous terrace pool areas, beautiful restaurant, excellent service within this historical Riad , very well appointed rooms , I stayed in an courtyard view room (more of a junior suite), that was very large, beautifully appointed, very comfortable bed. large screen TVs with Netflix and smart TV . We had a great breakfast up in the second floor , with elevator to upper floors."
 August 2021,5,Wow! What a great find in the Medina - loved it,"This was my second visit to Rabat. We were two English girls travelling in northern Morocco. We discovered Dar Shaan via Google/ Booking.com. Wow. What a find! Great location in the Medina, walking distance to Oudaya beach. Beautiful riad with a rooftop plunge pool and comfy sun loungers. The in-house restaurant is great, we enjoyed our breakfasts, and a delicious dinner one evening. Spotlessly clean and everything worked perfectly. The staff that we met were amazing, super friendly, attentive and professional - thanks in particular to Miriam on Front House. And Zinab in the spa, her hammam and massages are highly recommended! So happy to know that this place exists. Highly recommended for a Rabat city break with style"
 August 2021,5,Rabat Hotel at decent price and incredible service,"I was not looking for anything in particular in Rabat - we stumbled upon this hotel on tripadvisor. Everything was perfect - the staff, the venue, the vibe, the decor were all excellent at the price point. Would definitely visit again - the traveller photos do not do the decor justice!! It is a beautifully put together hotel."
 December 2019,5,Beautiful and tastefully decorated Riad in Rabat with a wonderfully welcoming staff!,"Riad Darshan is a welcoming sanctuary in a bustling city. From the beautiful patio inside to the tastefully decorated rooms, it is a place of rest that is ideally suited to explore Rabat. Our host Antoine was a dream to work with. The chef, Miriam keeps whipping up wonders from the kitchen. The staff, Sophia, Nessy and Leon make you feel like you are at home. Thank you family at Darshan! Shukran!"
 November 2019,4,"Very good overall, minor plumbing issues",We arrived in a car and our driver managed to contact the property who sent a member of staff to help with the luggage. Upon our check in we were asked to wait 30 mins for our room to get ready - and then we were told there was a plumbing issue and they offered us another room instead. The room was nice and clean. Breakfast was great also. There was also a water machine in the building so do bring your water bottle to save the ocean.
 October 2019,4,What a nice surprise,"After a very bad experience in the Dar Rabatiya last month we decided to give a try and go for dinner at the Dar Shaan. Romantic pure, a very nice host named Nessie, speaking five languages fluently, we where received in a very nice manner. Lovely Riad, mix of ancient and modern. The menu is small but the food was good, service was very friendly and efficient. We will be back, we felt at home and my clients left beeing very happy!"
 September 2019,5,Fantastic!!!,"We stayed at riad dar shaan on a recent trip to Morocco. Having never stayed in a riad we were not sure what to expect and we are so pleased when we arrived at Dar Shaan. They arranged a car to pick us up at the airport, which was so helpful considering the Medina is hard to navigate at first. Once we arrived at the riad we were warmly greeted and shown to our room. It is was perfect and spacious! The next morning we had a delicious breakfast with all the Moroccan specialities. We enjoyed the rooftop later that evening with some delicious Moroccan wine and olives. We highly recommend dar Shaan to anyone visiting Rabat! The staff couldn’t have been more helpful. The amenities were wonderful and the location very convenient to everything Rabat has to offer!"
 September 2019,5,Lovely surprise,"Dar Shaan is a lovely hotel. You walk a quiet alley to a hand carved wooden door, ring the bell, and arrive into a warm and inviting “home.” I say home because you feel at home as you are greeted by Owner Antoine and concierge Nessie. As you climb the colorful tile stairs, each room is a surprise. The rooms are comfortable and you sleep very good with darkness and quiet. The open atrium-court brings blue sky and fresh air. You must come!"
 September 2019,5,Beautiful Riad in Rabat,"We loved everything about our stay at the Dar Shaan in Rabat, Morocco. Staff were always so happy to help or answer questions. The Riad itself is stunning with a gorgeous courtyard in the middle. Our favourite was the rooftop terrace. We spent a few lazy afternoons lounging by the pool and drinking a rosè. It was great. Would I return to the Dar Shaan? Absolutely."
 August 2019,5,Well appointed,There were four of us holidaying in Morocco for 17 days. We stayed in riads within the Médinas. We enjoyed two nights stay at Dar Shaan Rabat. Very welcoming riad. Our bedrooms were very tastefully decorated and thank goodness had very good air conditioning. We enjoyed our breakfasts and we also had one evening meal at the riad which we enjoyed also. It makes it so easy to sometimes be able to have an evening meal at the riad. We did not use the pool even though some guests did. Very friendly English speaking staff. Totally enjoyed our stay at this riad.
 August 2019,5,Strongly recommended,"Very nice stay on this small and nicely decorated riad in Rabat. Very good location, clean, beautiful and spacious rooms, very good service. It s just a few steps walking to the medina and also to the Kasbah of the Udayas and the coastal walking area."
 July 2019,5,Beautiful Riad,"As most Riads are hidden away inside the Medina, they can be hard to find. Dar Shaan is worth the search. The rooms and amenities were flawless as was the service. The manager and staff were extremely helpful and polite. I highly recommend this place to stay."
 July 2019,5,A jewel in Rabat,"We were not expecting to much in Rabat but this jewel really impressed us. The quality of design, fittings and finishes along with the friendly professional stall makes this a must visit. The owners were also very inclusive. Great place."
 July 2019,5,Attention to detail,As soon as we enter the door we knew it was going to be a beautiful place. It’s very well maintained and tastefully furnished. It was bright and light and very welcoming. Our room and our daughters room was beautifully appointed and we love the little courtyard and rooftop pool. Wish we could stay longer. Breakfast was also lovely and service was friendly and welcoming.
 April 2019,5,Peaceful Ria's,A group of 6 of us stayed here in April and it was amazing. The service was great and the guy who owns the Road was lovely. He does a lot of surfing himself and suggested we went along. As my first time surfing it was a great experience and would recommend if you are staying in this area. All the rooms were great and breakfast was lovely with great orange juice. Great WiFi connection and really close to the Medina and other restaurants.
 May 2019,5,"Gorgeous, stylish Riad","We only stayed for one night at this heavenly riad, but it was one of our favourite places on our trip. Wonderful rooms with super comfy beds. The courtyard is stunning and we loved the swing! The rooftop pool was a hit with our kids. We had dinner which was good - we're a vegan/veggie family and the cooks were able to accommodate our dietary needs at short notice. Staff were friendly and helpful. Great stay!"
 April 2019,5,Beautifully restored Riad,"This place is stunning and a lovely example of how old architecture can be coupled with modern chic restoration. The rooms are individual, very clean and comfortable. The main hotel foyer is a gorgeous open air courtyard extending to stone balconies with glass balustrades on each floor. There is a rooftop terrace, seating area and swimming pool which catch the sun whilst enjoying views over Rabat. The hotel is a very short walk from the mouth of the river, beach and markets. Be sure to get a surfing lesson down at the surf school - the guys there are great and it’s a very good place to learn and very good value. All in all I’d definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Rabat."
 April 2019,5,love this place...,"top class. this is a beautiful, stylish and hip hotel. awesome owners. fantastic staff. delicious food, comfy beds. amazing peaceful roof terraces with a pool and views over rabat. i was there for an event...when i come back to rabat with my family there is only one place i will stay. just such a nice place to be."
 April 2019,5,Quick by excellent stay,"We only spent one night here, but the room and shower were great. Staff was helpful even meeting us when we arrived late. Breakfast was good and they take credit cards. Two blocks from a major street yet still quiet and but we didn't have to drag our bags very far"
 March 2019,5,Stay in Dar Shaan,We stayed for two nights in Rabat at Dar Shaan. The owner and staff were very welcoming and helpful. the rooms were beautiful and conveniently located near the local market. The restaurant had excellent food and the breakfasts were very good. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Rabat!
 December 2018,5,Amazing place and great massage,"This place is a little oasis, very beautiful and the people are really friendly. We can especially recommend the massage and hamam with hand-made scrub. A real treat! (Book in advance) we would def. stay there again."
 December 2018,5,Outstanding Riad in the heart of the Medina,"We checked out this morning and I can't say enough great tings about Dar Shaan. We were greeting with hot mint tea and shown to our beautiful, tastefully decorated room. We had dinner at the restaurant ant the food was delicious and really reasonable in terms of price. Nothing best than the location since it is in the middle one the Medina where you can shop, visit and eat or get acquainted with all the rich civilization. It is walking distance to many landmark places. Antoine, the owner is absolutely one of the best hosts we had. He gave us the history of the Riad and was so kind making sure that we had everything we need. This is a MUST if you ever visit Rabat and are looking for a hospitable, beautiful and spotless clean place to stay at a reasonable price."
 November 2018,5,Lovely stay in a beautiful hotel,This was a fabulous hotel! Clearly the owner has a fantastic sense of architectural style. The place has been impeccably restored and rebuilt. Our room was absolutely lovely. It had the traditional Moroccan details but with a modern flair. Breakfast was delightful and delicious with everything homemade. There is a really great rooftop terrace with a beautiful view. The staff of the hotel was warm and welcoming and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone going to Rabat.
 November 2018,5,Wonderful hotel in a great city!,"We loved Dar Shaan in Rabat! It was by far the nicest place we stayed in Morocco and for quite a reasonable price in light of the quality of the hotel. The hotel has been recently renovated and is beautifully decorated with comfortable furnishings, tasteful decorations, and nice lighting. Most importantly for me (because I have a bad back), the bed was very comfortable. It is also well located only a few minutes walk from the beautiful kasbah and the waterfront. The location was really excellent, easy walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see. I would definitely recommend a visit to lovely Rabat and a stay at this wonderful little hotel."
 November 2018,5,Delightful boutique hotel,"From the moment you enter the hall, you are in a quiet, pleasant oasis. A wall in the courtyard contains a beautiful passage from Le Petit Prince. Our gorgeous room with a sitting area, desk, super bathroom and king bed was on the ground floor. There are easy stairs to the upper floors and an elevator if needed. We had an excellent dinner with the dining room all to ourselves at the dar on the first night, followed by very good breakfasts each day. This was our loveliest hotel in Morocco."
 October 2018,5,Lovely two night stay in Rabat,"We stayed two nights at the beginning of our Moroccan adventure at the charming Dar Shaan. The staff was warm and welcoming and went out of their way to help us. Unfortunately, the night of arrival I was in need of a doctor and the owner, Antoine, couldn't have been more helpful. He called a doctor, translated, and even went to the pharmacy to get what was prescribed. The riad is stylish, clean, nicely furnished and has a great location near the medina. It was walking distance to the waterfront. There was a great view of the city from the rooftop and was a great place to watch the sunset while enjoying a glass of wine. Breakfast was very good as was the dinner that was available upon request. I would highly recommend Dar Shaan if you plan to travel to Rabat."
 September 2018,5,Dar Shaan is like home,"The people, the food and the location is excellent. Rooms are charming and clean, it’s a true Moroccan experience to stay here. It was our first night in the country, and after a bad flight experience with Air France (and I’m confident our last), they were so warm and welcoming he minute we walked in. It felt like home immediately. The location is great, right in the Médina. If you’re traveling to Rabat, don’t stay at some typical hotel...stay here!"
 September 2018,5,Magical Setting,"Upon entering Dar Shaan we were transported to a magical setting in a magical city. Everywhere we looked there was something beautiful to see. The gardens were spectacular. Vibrant colorful fabrics and stained glass, along with beautiful urns, flower pots, lighting around the pool overlooking the mountains and the city - everywhere there was a feast for the eyes! The staff was warm and welcoming. We hated to leave."
 September 2018,5,High Standard!,"On our journey through Morocco thus was the finest Riad we stayed in! Sure it is a little bit more expensive, but that is totally worth it! It is clean, quiet, located very good and the staff is realy friendly and helpful! The rooms and the restaurant are stylish and breakfast is really good! Also the rooftop pool is the first pool i went in on our journey. If i go to Rabat again, i will stay there again!"
 August 2018,5,Premium service,"Although we arrived after 11 pm, we were welcomed as if we were at home, offered freshly cooked dinner, rare Moroccan beer and wine, massage and a top class overall service! The facilities look spotless and beautifully decorated. The great pool on the top level is a bonus (lots of towels provided)! Special thanks to León and the reception guys (a young lady and and a young gentleman), who made our stay one to remember!"
 July 2018,5,Highly recommended,Nice and clean Riad within walking distance to the fortress and the coast! It is well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The host was helpful and the breakfast was good! I will definitely recommend it to the other travelers!
 May 2018,5,Excellent Riad in the Medina,Antoine --the owner--was welcoming and showed us around his restored Riad. The furnishings are modern with a Moroccan touch. Our suite was beautiful and dinner/breakfast was excellent. I highly recommend staying at this well located Riad in Rabat.
 April 2018,4,Welcome start to Morocco vacation,"Dar Shaan was a great first stop on our 10 day trip. The owner and staff provided great advice and made us feel right at home - from the perfect suggestion for where to go for lunch, to mint tea by the pool to listening to call to prayer at sunset with the owner. The breakfast was delicious - and the dining room is even more charming than it looks on the website, and the rooms were nicely appointed and comfortable. You can see how much love and attention went into the Riad's restoration. And, it's a great location. 10 minute walk to the casbah and sea in one direction, and 10 minutes to the markets in the other."
 May 2018,5,Excellent Riad in Rabat,This was our first hotel in our trip to Morocco and it was one of the best ones. The service and hospitality were unbelievable. The Riad was recently restored and the decoration was done with great taste!
 April 2018,5,A great first look at Morocco!,"I flew in from Abu Dhabi to Rabat, so Dar Shaan was my first look at Morocco during a 15-day trip... and it did not disappoint! I loved the contrast between the traditional Moroccan elements and eclectic decor items dotted throughout. The staff are really hospitable; they did everything from make restaurant recommendations and guide us on the domestic rail system to walk us to the taxi to help with our luggage. Highly recommended."
 March 2018,5,Beautifully restored Riad,"Riad Dar Shaan is a beautifully restored Riad, mixing modern materials and room conveniences with traditional Moroccan elements. The room was immaculate with all necessities. The shower was divine! Location is ideal for navigating the medina area and the staff were incredibly helpful with any questions. Great start to our time in Morocco!"
 December 2017,5,Location Location Location and great service,"We were lucky to be the first guests at this great Riad. Close to everything, 20 min walk from the museums, 5 minutes to the medina and Oudaya. The staff were very supportive and gave great ideas as for things to check out, restaurants that were close by (less then 5 minute walk). Great location to see a lot and spend time to soak it all in. Great place!"
