 September 2022,5,Modern hotel in central location,"I stayed here for 4 nights in September 2022 and enjoyed the stay. The room was spacious and comfortable, breakfast was a delightful buffet with American, European, and Moroccan foods, and the restaurant staff were friendly. The tram line is 1 block away, and you are walking distance to the art museum. Visiting Hassan Tower was about a 20 minute walk, and 20 minutes more brought you to the entrance to the Medina."

 October 2022,1,Filthy! Stay away.,"My experience here was horrible. Stayed in room 404 on October 1, 2022. It was so filthy, as were the hallways. It was prepaid through a private tour and it was late at night after a very long day or we would have walked out when we saw the room. The carpets in our room and in the hallway were covered in nasty stains, the shower had loads of black mold on the walls and in the corners, the handle of the hairdryer was encased in dirt. My nightstand was a rickety dirty piece of glass. The room smelled so badly of mildew that we had to sleep with the balcony door open. The breakfast was not much better. They had food that was supposed to be hot (scrambled eggs, meats, etc.) sitting on hot plates that were not working. I asked for scrambled eggs and the lady pointed me to the cold‚Ä¶"
 September 2022,3,Has potential to be better,"We stayed here for 3 nights and our experience was mixed. BEDROOM Good : We had a suite that consisted of three rooms. It was spacious, clean and well stocked with amenities. Bad : There were no doors between the different areas and it would benefit from a door separating the bedroom from the rest. The bed was hard and lumpy so was very uncomfortable. The air conditioning did not work. There were large stains on the carpet. BREAKFAST Good : The quality of the breakfast was good. The waitresses were polite but only one was friendly. Bad : Apart from asking us about tea/coffee we were not asked if we needed anything else. There was no juice available and we had to ask for some every day - on two occasions it arrived after a long time but on the third it never arrived until‚Ä¶"

 December 2021,5,Great location for our trip,Great Hotel to stay in for a few nights! The staff was wonderful ‚Ä¶ esp Salah. Salah helped us with directions numerous times and even walked out with us to point us in the right direction. We ate at the restaurant one night and the food was very good. The hotel is walking distance to the train station.
 November 2021,5,Great stay,was a great experience. would like to thank all stuff especially Mustapha who did a recognised effort to make our stay pleasant and fantastic. Restaurant also is wonderful and full of variety of international dishes. Overall I give 5 stars for Le Diwan hotel and recommend it for all.

 September 2021,3,Very ordinary,"We spent one night in this property. The location is very good being easy walking distance to the casbah and variety of restaurants, that aside everything else in the hotel was on the border of average to poor . The check in and out was efficient but not very welcoming , the baggage and parking Porter was not only very efficient and helpful but was consistently friendly.The room (601) was reasonably spacious but very old fashioned and slightly depressing it was moderately clean but nothing outstanding facilities in the room were minimal but connectivity was adequate. Sleep quality was acceptable. The bathroom had been partially renovated but retained old ceramics which were definitely in need of cleaning toiletries were adequate but towels were of the use to be white variety‚Ä¶"
 September 2021,5,Good,Very helpfull and friendly staff. Rwceptionist was very helpfull. Was running late and by the time i arrived i had a very limited time to eat out. She took my id and said to go and eat and everything will be ready when i came back. No fuss very professional. Also offered me the option to exchange money also which was very convenient. Would highly reccomend for a helpfull service.
 September 2021,3,Good location? Breakfast buffet,"We stayed at this downtown hotel in her butt for two nights. While the rooms are adequate in size, with king-size beds and small balconies, the bathroom definitely needed to be deep cleaned. There was a lot of mold in the bathtub tile corners. We were a little surprised to find that there were no drinking glasses in the bathroom. Also, while breakfast was excellent as far as choices, service was spotty and slow. We had to ask several times for coffee. The air conditioner works fine in the rooms, but the common areas are not cool, mostly because doors are left open to let warm air in in many instances."
 May 2021,5,Incredible Spa Services and Great Hotel in Rabat,"I traveled to Rabat in May and stayed at Hotel LeDiwan for a week. My stay was so comfortable! Everything was absolutely perfect; the management and hotel staff made my stay exceptionally well. I traveled solo for business and everyone at the hotel was welcoming and made me feel taken care of. The hotel is centrally located to shopping, medina, museums, beach area, banks, coffee shops, covid-19 testing labs and more. I walked everywhere and only used the taxi if I needed to arrive somewhere quickly. I had a little down time in between meetings and was able to take advantage of the AMAZING, I mean SUPER AMAZING spa services.

 September 2019,1,The worst experience of my life,"In 2017 I decided to take my husband and two precious little boys age 2 years and 4 months to visit my home town, so I picked this hotel to stay in for couple days while visiting my own family, I arrive to the hotel a little after midnight and try to check in so we can all rest after a long day traveling across the world. The receptionist asked me for a marriage certificate to prove that this is my husband and these boys are mine or else we can‚Äôt check in to our room that we already paid for. I found it uncalled for but I did show him my kids birth certificates and my green card as I don‚Äôt travel Carrying my marriage papers with me specially after so many years of being married.

 June 2019,2,Rabat... after all,"I have to admit there'd been a lot of arranging for this business stay, including hotel. I was warned before, to ask specifically for non smoking room on higher floor. And that safety in Rabat in general is not the highest. I was prepared, but still shocked. I arrived late because my flight was delayed and there was nobody at dusty reception. Then some guy appeared taking my luggage and asking for tips. Receptionist appeared, I asked him twice is room is non smoking, he ensured me it is and sent me with this ""luggage guy"" upstairs. Room was of course full of smoke smell and claimed as non smoking. Also guy was waiting in room until I gave him some money (I didn't have any dirhams, so I ended up giving him 10Euros just to leave me alone). After complaining about room being non‚Ä¶"

 March 2020,5,Excellent hotel in its class,"The Le Duran has good sized rooms, comfortable beds, nice clean washrooms. The breakfast buffet is very good In quality and quantity. Staff are helpful.

 March 2020,5,A Rockin‚Äô Moroccan Massage,"A massage is a special treat for me when I travel to different countries. After three airports and 14 hours in air I arrived in Robat, Morocco and checked into the lovely LeDiwan hotel. Noticing the spa was advertising massage I booked one hoping it would help me sleep. I would highly recommend a massage with Charifa. Truly it was so relaxing I almost fell asleep then and there. The soft Moroccan music played in concert with her hands moving in waves over my body. Charifa has a talent for providing an experience that will be etched in your muscle memory. It was in mine. Lynn"
 February 2020,5,Superb Blend of Hospitality and Location,"Clean, classy hotel ideally located in the best part of town. Close enough to the Medina, but far enough to be extremely safe anytime during the day or night. Rooms were very clean and upscale. The best part however was the staff. Extremely hospitable and responsive, wanting to make sure that each individual guest had a personal experience of note. This included being greeted by name at check in. Highly unusual for most cookie cutter places these days. The front office manager Mr. Omar Moursli personally welcomed everyone in the group as did the chief concierge, Mr. Salah Malaki who even took us to the rooms himself to make sure they were to our satisfaction. The first night when we walked into the restaurant, there was no one in sight. The entire bus load of people descended‚Ä¶"
 March 2020,5,The Mohammed and Said with the mustache Rock!!,"Our breakfast at the Dewan were extra special because of the friendly funny service of Mohammed and Said( with mustache). Actually every staff at the Dewan gave excellent service. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the breakfast buffet huge and full of regional specialties, the front desk staff and door staff always attentive and kind. Highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure travel."
 February 2020,5,Very good hotel. Great service. Great staff.,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights. Excellent location, good sized and well appointed rooms. The BIG plus is the staff: front desk, bartending, porters, servers in the restaurants. In particular, we had a server in the main dining room on the night of our arrival named HANANE who was so friendly, informative and well trained. It was our first meal in Morrocco and she helped to make it memorable....She helped us choose our first Moroccan dishes and Moroccan wine. Great ambassador for the hotel!"
 February 2020,5,Hammam Spa,"Charifa at the hammam spa was amazing. She provided a great massage and great hammam experience. I highly recommend seeing her and trying the spa if you are in the area. Spa and Charifa get 5 stars. The hotel staff is really nice. I wouldn‚Äôt give the hotel a 5 star rating because it is not very clean. Loved the breakfast, they serve freshly squeezed orange juice:)"
 February 2020,5,Spa,"If you happen to be in Morocco and you are looking for a great spa experience make sure you book it at the Li Diwan. My masseuse, Charifa, was amazing. I travel a lot and have gotten many massages but this one was really good. I have a couple of days left here and I am sure I will be back again before I go."
 January 2020,5,Spa is great!,"I had the 120 minute Hammam and massage treatment. It was my first Hammam and Najia was terrific. It was cleansing, exfoliating and a massage in one. After the massage by Charifa put the icing on the cake. Highly recommended after a long day of traveling!"
 January 2020,5,The best spa treatment,"I would like to leave a comment about the spa specialist Loubna! She is AMAZING! I‚Äôve been to full body massage and hammam, and it was the best 2 hours this year! First of all I would like to say that the spa is very clean and comfortable. Loubna welcome you very kindly, and make the atmosphere very relaxing. I want to say that I received a real full body massage from head to tip fingers! And after in hammam a full body wash, scrub and lotion. After all, she made me tea, and it was fantastic. I will highly recommend this spa and Loubna!"
 January 2020,4,Pleasant start to a tour,We stayed here at the start of a Gate 1 tour. The room was fine and the opening dinner in the hotel's restaurant was quite good. The staff was really friendly and helpful in responding quickly to several requests.
 January 2020,5,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel provides extremely good service as well as very clean, quiet rooms. The restaurant ‚ÄúLa Brasserie‚Äùs food is excellent . The servers Houcine, Hanane and Sanae were very professional and went out of their way to make us feel welcome, detailing their traditional dishes. The Food & Beverage Director was very helpful as well. Le Diwan is located in a very nice area where you can walk at your leisure. We hope to come back here and stay for a longer time."
 January 2020,5,Great Service,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of a Gate1 tour. The front desk staff, particularly Hamza, were fantastic, patiently taking care of our every request. Loubna and Charles, members of the spa staff, gave wonderful massages. Breakfast is also very good. Our room feels a bit tired, but the excellent service makes up for that."
 January 2020,5,Great service at hotel and spa!,We stayed 2 nights on the first leg of our trip and it was very nice. The service was exceptional. My wife and I also treated ourselves to a hammam in the spa and Charifa and Loubna were excellent! It was our first hammam and they made it a great experience! I highly recommend doing this. It was great!
 January 2020,2,"Noisy, Smoky, Sewage","This hotel is in a great location and initially shows promise. However, our 2 night stay there was very disappointing and very challenging to the senses. It allows smoking in the lobby, first sign of an inferior hotel. It is apparently built near a sewage sight as it reeked of sewage at night. To make matters worse, they have machines on each floor that are used to negate the bad smell by dispensing an overpowering perfume smell that permeates the hallways. Amazingly, this smell is even worse than the sewage smell. Finally, and not least, we were kept awake very late one night by some very loud guests in the room above us and we had to complain several times to the front desk before anything was done. Stay away from this inferior hotel, unless you want to leave with a mixture of‚Ä¶"
 December 2019,4,Excellent service,"PROS: - Very friendly service from the car park to front desk for check-in/out - Moden design, simple but functional in all aspects - Great breakfast buffet (not too big but with all different choices), again great service team - Very central located for a walk to old town CONS: - no sport possibilities - some furnishings and equipments in bathroom should be replaced"
 December 2019,5,Regular customer - recommend Le Diwan,I come to Rabat for work every 2-3 months and always stay at Le Diwan. I recommend the hotel. The personnel is really nice and one feels at home. This time I tried the spa and really enjoyed the signature massage and the hammam-scrub. Great service from Najia and Dougna.
 December 2019,5,Excellent Hotel,"Every time, it looks like I am home!!, the service is excellent and the people are very warm and kind. The location is very close to the tramway, medina, restaurents, mesum, downtown, train station etc..."
 December 2019,5,Great Experience,"I normally don't write reviews, but I wanted to share how great Hotel Le diwan is. It's conveniently close to the downtown, The staff are friendly and helpful, Ismail the front office young man was just great and he helped us with everything we needed, the rooms were super comfortable, and everything was clean and simple. I can't recommend them enough!"
 December 2019,3,Lovely staff but it falls short on some things,"Pros: Staff are great, rooms are comfortable, spa is reasoanly priced & the breakfast/dinner is nice! Cons: Location has little around it, wifi is terrible and I could not even do e-mail, no gym. Unsure what else to stay but it is an average to good hotel at best."
 December 2019,5,A very nice central hotel with a world class spa,"I have stayed at Diwan‚Äôs for two nights. Clean, central, excellent service. Very good Brasserie, I had a succulent tajine well accompanied by a decent local red wine. I particularly recommend the spa of the hotel, where I used the massage services twice. Najia is an outstanding physiotherapist who mixes the right kind of strength and relaxation; this was the best by far of my spa experiences in the last couple of years."
 November 2019,4,"Great staff, warm and kindest assistance at reception desk, always proactive to solve problems.",Recomendation: a massage session or two. Najia brought me back to relax and peacefulness after a one hour of treatment. All people at reception focused on help you to find solutions to your problems..
 October 2019,4,My First Moroccan Hotel Stay,"The room was beautiful and I had a small but lovely balcony with a great view. The hotel didn't have a pool or a gym but the staff was friendly and I liked the decor of the lobby. Breakfast was included and it was typical cereal, bread, fruit but there were Moroccan pancakes that I got to try for the first time. They were OK. The hotel was in a convenient location. I was able to walk to a pharmacy since I caught a head cold on the plane ride and there was a store nearby where we could buy water and snacks."
 November 2019,2,Nice and comfortable bedroom,I took a Gate1 tour in Morocco and we were supposed to stay in Le Dewan for two nights. We got a 5th Fl room with a good view(504). The beds were nice with clean sheets and soft comforters. But the bathroom is really old. It needs to be renovated. The drifting water flows through the ring of the sink all the way to the floor which became slippery. What made me really upset was the second morning episode on 11/14/2019. I didn‚Äôt have a good sleep because of the long journey from the New York-Casablanca flight and the Casablanca-Rabat taxi drive. I forgot that I was supposed to go to the mezzanine breakfast room. By mistake I entered the First-floor room. I picked up the food and was about to eat when a middle aged waitress suddenly stood in front of me and looked at me with a‚Ä¶
 October 2019,4,Good location,"I will give this hotel high marks on location. You can walk to the Medina, downtown, shops, museum, etc. There are restaurants nearby. The rooms were a bit small and not so clean. The breakfast was fine with made to order eggs, assortment of breads, sweet rolls and fruit. No decaf coffee but hot chocolate was tasty. We did eat in their dinner restaurant and the meal was fine. We were in Morocco for two weeks and I never got sick but we ate in the hotels or highly recommended restaurants. Service was good."
 October 2019,1,Dirty,The room was dirty with stains on the carpets and coffee stains on the walls.when I took a shower the bathroom filled with water and I almost slipped. This was bad experience and I would recommend to stay away and book another hotel.
 October 2019,4,"Average rooms, good food and service","I was on a Gate 1 tour and this was the first accommodation upon arrival in Rabat. For 1 night it as perfectly fine, the room was small but well kept. Furnishings were outdated and could use some upgrading. The bed was very comfortable. Dinner and breakfast were great, and all staff were very nice. There are many ATMs nearby, but if you walk out the hotel front door, turn left, the 2nd ATM slightly up the street is the one that offers English option. Just put your card in first to get it started."
 October 2019,3,Ok accommodation,This is a 3.5 Not quite very good but better than average View was poor The amenities were fine. It quite modern as expected but no major issues The breakfast was good again better than average but short of very good
 September 2019,4,A Wonderful End to my Moroccan Tour!,"I stayed at the Le Diwan Hotel Rabat Hotel for two nights as part of a group tour through Morocco. This hotel is in the heart of Rabat and in walking distance to many sites, including the Medina. The very modern city train system travels right across the street from the hotel. It is a fairly modern-looking hotel. While the weather in Rabat is much cooler than most of the country, A/C is still needed. The lobby and mezzanine did not have A/C and it was slightly stuffy in those areas. The room is small, but generally nice and clean. There was a slight musty odor when entering the room, but the odor dissipated after a short period of time. The bathroom is also small but has most of the necessary amenities. There is a nice sitting area outside the room with a garden. The breakfast‚Ä¶"
 September 2019,3,Hotel Berbere is 3 Star,"This hotel is decent. We came to stay for a overnight with the Group of Morocco Tours for 12 days trip co'z next day, we are leaving for Fez early morning with the group. We find that the room is clean, good and comfortable to sleep in. Breakfast was good as it did filled our stomach for a long drive to a different city. Hotel Staffs are helpful with all our Group Luggage as our Tour Guide has mentioned to identified our luggage so that they can be put inside the Tour Bus with the correct Passengers' Lugguage - No One are to be left behind without their luggage, this systems ensured that everyone have it before we left for a different city - approx. 8 hours drive to Fez. We enjoyed our stay."
 March 2019,3,Very nice hotel room with not good air con,"This hotel and room was very nice, staff were helpful but the air-conditioning was insufficient as I have a child with excema. The breakfast was amazing but had to leave this hotel early to go to a hotel that has proper air conditioning"
 July 2019,3,Would have been 5 star but,The day I was checking out with my group really left a bitter taste in my mouth on this place. I had charged a few things to my room and the night before checkout I settled up so there wasn‚Äôt any issues in the AM. Well got pulled aside by the tour guide and the front desk had zero record of me settling up. Thankfully I had the receipt and credit card receipts in my purse. They were like oops our bad. I felt like a scum bag for a minute with being pulled aside.
 July 2019,4,Pleasant stay in Rabat,"Super friendly and helpful staff, always asking if I needed anything. Room was clean and comfortable. The WiFi was reliable. Breakfast had a wide variety of items to choose from. The tv had maybe 3 English channels, but had no problems streaming Netflix."
 June 2019,5,Mesmerizing stay,"Perfectly located near Marina, daytime spent kayaking and windsurfing. After nice dinner, (couscous is the best I ever tried) hotel provided free tickets for Mawazine Festival. Travis Scott performance was mesmerizing. Will definitly come back"
 June 2019,3,"Comfortable, quiet, somewhat dull neighborhood","Great staff, friendly and helpful, speak a wide variety of languages. This hotel is a short walk from the contemporary art museum, archaeology museum (recommended), and the local medina (an average medina). The rooms and baths are comfortable, quiet; breakfast buffet was average. A relatively dull neighborhood, with few shops or restaurants, but was full of ATMs and banks. The elevators were slow and choppy; most guests used to stairs to get to the rooms, which in this hotel are 3-6 floors above the lobby."
 June 2019,5,Mawazine,Thank you very much for the super welcoming!beautiful city. The show was great and the audience were amazing. The break fast was amazing and the staff was very kind. The room was very clean and the bed were clean. Hope to come back soon
 June 2019,4,nice location - helpful staff,special thanks to the hotel manager Mr Idriss. The staff was helpfull. Very good location. A delicious breakfast. Would be nice in the future to renovate windows and have noise insulation from streets outside (double vitrage).
 February 2019,4,"Very nice hotel in Rabat, Morocco.","Stayed at this property for 2 nights with gate 1 travel as a part of a 7 night Morocco tour. Hotel is modern, nicely decorated ,close to main attractions, rooms are very modern,fresh and comfortable.Buffet breakfast was good with a lot of hot and cold choices. The onsight restaurant is excellent serving local cuisine as well as western dishes. staff were very nice and accomodating. Would definately stay again."
 May 2019,4,Great hotel.,"What a great and lovely hotel. We stayed for two nights and had a wonderful stay. Clean, comfortable, great staff and helpful. Great location as you are able to walk too all major attractions. The buffet breakfast was very good, lots of variety, hot coffee and healthy. I would recommend getting a massage at the hotel, it was just what i needed to finish off a month tour of Morocco."
 May 2019,5,"Great service, best food!",I stayed for a week and the amazing staff made me feel like at home. It‚Äôs located right in the middle of everything so all the popular spots are within a few minutes of drive/walk. I had some of the best food at the Brasserie le diwan. Keep it up guys üëçüèª
 May 2019,2,Overrated,"This hotel is a nice 2 star hotel. It‚Äôs not quite 3 stars, and it‚Äôs a far cry from 4 stars. The carpet in the room was filthy: badly stained all over. It needs to replaced‚Ä¶ like 5 years ago. It made being in the room feel unclean. When we asked about changing to another room, were told that it‚Äôs like that in every room. We also just didn't find the room was cleaned very well, per photos - walls, doors and other surfaces had marks that I was able to remove with a cloth so just shows they weren't cleaned well. There was a loud rattling every night through the wall ‚Äì not sure the cause of the sound. The reception staff were always nice, but restaurant staff applied a confused policy around food during Ramadan. E.g. I chose this hotel because it had restaurants open during Ramadan‚Ä¶"
 April 2019,1,Shame on you!,"Am shocked ,, this hotel haring cheap staff they are spying on the customers privacy life !

I went for 5 star hotel but after what I heard from my fianc√© I was shocked like they were setting with me while am talking to my family!how sad is that destroying other people‚Äôs life for ugly benefits .. I will never come back and I don‚Äôt recommend this hotel to no one as there is no trust , no privacy and no respect at all .. shame one you seriously."
 May 2019,4,Good location,"As far as hotels go, Hotel Le Diwan is a good choice for the money. It certainly isn't the most luxurious hotel in Rabat, but the rooms are a decent size and comfortable, staff is friendly, and the food quite good. The biggest bonus is the hotel's proximity to everything. You can walk to most points of interest without an issue. Pros: Breakfast - very good WiFi - free, fast, reliable Location - roam the sights easily Air Conditioning - quiet and works well Curtains - total darkness if desired Cons: Carpet in my room was dirty - appeared somewhat consistent throughout the common area, too Gym - None"
 April 2019,5,"Stellar customer service, great location, fabulous breakfast",We got a suite and it was very nice and super clean. Very comfortable bed. Right on a busy roundabout but if the windows are closed the sound is muffled. There was a nice breeze when the windows are open. Easy to walk to many sights and very safe. What makes this hotel stand out is the staff. We were particularly WOWED by Omar the desk manager and Younes Malki who went way above and beyond the expected and personally made sure that my wife got to visit the site of the hospital where she was born. It's being turned into a hotel now but Younes drove our party of four there and walked with us to make sure we were safe. He was so gracious and sympathetic when my wife became a little emotional. The breakfast staff was very attentive and the porters were friendly and accommodating. I‚Ä¶
 April 2019,3,It was ok,"The room is worn out. Just scrapes, scuffs everywhere & toothpaste splatter on the magnifying mirror. I tried turning on the heat, but it never came on. The food was not very good. Eggs were cold. You can always eat yogurt, though!"
 February 2019,4,"Very friendly staff, feels like family","The staff were very helpful. They helped me correct my reservation date error, book a city tour, and get local deserts such as Macaron. The hotel has a nice atmosphere that makes you feel like famil, and nice breakfast. My visit was short so I didn't check the rest of the facilities."
 March 2019,4,GOOD HOTEL,Good hotel location is excellent and staff where good the breakfast was excellent near restaurants and museums rooms are good not great and shower was hard to use and awkward to get into bar very dark and unfriendly
 March 2019,4,"Only overnight, first night in Morocco","Our tour of Morocco began in Rabat, so we were only here for one night. The staff was friendly, and was quite patient with us crazy folks from Philadelphia. :) Two of my travel companions and I had a light lunch in the restaurant before gathering with the rest of our group. The food was tasty and filling, and the wait staff was very friendly. None of us speaks French, which is common here, but the staff knew enough English for us to get along fine. The room was small, but not claustrophobically so. There were two twin beds pushed together, making it look like one queen bed, but they were made up separately, so my roommate and I each had our own bed. Slippers and robes were provided, which was a nice touch. There was a bit of a problem flushing the toilet, at times, if others‚Ä¶"
 March 2019,4,Great restaurant,"Conveniently located, the hotel is in a busy area and there is a lot of noise going on outside. Like many hotels in Morocco, they use a heavy scent/perfume in the public areas, but it was not too bad in the guest rooms. There was, however, a faint moldy smell in the rooms. The front desk staff was very nice. We had a superb dinner in the restaurant and breakfast was also good. However, the breakfast crew was less attentive and the service was inconsistent. Sometimes they brought coffee, sometimes you had to fend for yourself. Sometimes they were there to be of assistance, other times you had to get up and hunt someone down."
 February 2019,5,another great stay,"as a regular visitor to rabat on business this is one of the places I prefer to stay, very central and practical, the hotel is clean and friendly staff, great buffet breakfast and very good value for money."
 March 2019,5,Nice place,"The McGallery Diwan Hotel in Rabat is a comfortable place to stay. The room was spacious and nicely furnished and the complimentary water and wifi were appreciated. The staff were helpful, friendly and carried out their duties effectively. The breakfast was varied and delicious with an egg station. All in all, a nice place to stay which is well-located only short walks to the main train station (12 minutes) and souqs (20 minutes)."
 January 2019,3,"Good hotel, but one that can be improved","Good hotel, but one that can be improved. Well located. The staff is nice, except maybe one person in the restaurant. The regular staff needs to be more welcoming and smiling... The conference rooms are OK."
 February 2019,4,Comfortable With a good nights sleep,"We had a delicious meal in the restaurant for a good price. A convenient place to dine if you have just arrived jet lagged and couldnt be bothered searching for food on your first night. The rooms are comfortable and we slept well. Hot water are wifi is reliable, there is a room safe. Location is quite central and staff are excellent. The buffet breakfast was comprehensive but more low sugar cereal would enhance the experience."
 February 2019,4,First 2 nights in Morocco here,"We were on an escorted tour with Gate 1 Travel for 13 days throughout Morocco. We stayed here our first two nights. Very nice, comfortable, great food, service. The only reason I gave this 4 of 5 stars is that the security device at the front door deactivates the room keys. They know this is an issue, but failed to share that with us. So, many in our group found out the hard way once we got back to our rooms after being out, necessitating a trip back to the desk. Minor issue, more of a slight annoyance. Would have been nice to know ahead of time."
 March 2019,4,"Good location, helpful staff","With no point of comparison to other Moroccan hotels, Le Diwan is fairly upscale. Our room is comfortable, as are the beds. Though the room is nicely decorated with warm wood throughout, it is in need of some minor renovation - carpeting is stained, the bathroom sink is chipped, etc. The buffet breakfast is good with plenty of selections, including an omelette chef. The front desk is helpful with suggestions and directions. Several restaurants and a supermarket are within very easy walking distance. The Medina and souk (market/shopping) are an easy 20 minute walk from the hotel."
 January 2019,5,"Very Nice Hotel, Nice Part of Town","Enjoyed staying at this hotel for two nights, just after arriving in Morocco from the U.S. The hotel is very well maintained, very clean with very friendly and attentive staff. Enjoyed a ""welcome dinner"" and drinks in the bar as well."
 January 2019,4,"Comfortable Beds, Reasonable Breakfast, Friendly Staff","January 31 and February 1, 2019 - As part of a 34 person tour group, we stayed for two nights at the Hotel Le Diwan. The hotel has an excellent location, the staff are friendly and efficient, and the rooms are comfortable. Our beds slept well, the bathroom was clean and the towels were good. As in most European and other foreign country hotels, they do not provide a face cloth in the bathroom. So, we always bring our own. Our room had a television, balcony (although view was not too good), and a hot pot/coffee maker, and sufficient flat space for laying out our clothes, etc. Unfortunately, the breakfast does not have a very good cereal selection. But, you can get eggs to order like over easy or an omelette. And, there is fruit and plenty of bread selections. I would‚Ä¶"
 February 2019,4,Good hotel,"Hotel location is good,it is down town. Rooms are wide clean and comfort ,restaurant Brasserie is super nice marrocan and international food,really tasty.Wifi is good,Tv channels are not nice ,staff are friendly"
 December 2018,4,I expected a bit more,"I choose this place because of the location, and because they belong to the familiar hotel chain ‚Äì so I could anticipate the level of service. It started very well, they have sent me message few days before my arrival asking about my needs ‚Äì which was promising. But after I sent them my requests ‚Äì I had to wait almost 24 hours for a respond. They promised to fulfil all my request, but when I came to the hotel ‚Äì just half of it was done. During the day I have ordered more water ‚Äì it has never arrived. Infrastructurally they are good, some refreshment is needed, but everything was clean. Location was extremely good ‚Äì everything was in walking distance. Breakfast was good too ‚Äì in line with chain standards, with some local products. To conclude, they have a great potential, but‚Ä¶"
 December 2018,5,Good hotel,"Good value. Nice and friendly staff,excellent d√©cor. Thank you for a wonderful stay at the hotel .I was upgraded.the decor was top of the Line,the staffs were ever smiling and the rooms were clean. The location IS the best you can think of.it IS a great value for money."
 November 2018,5,Second Stay in 2 years at Le Diwan and still excellent,"Since I had such a good meal at the hotel in 2017, I decided to stay again this year. I found the hotel. Although it is not near any place walking, it is worth it for their great restaurant. Service by the staff is still very helpful"
 December 2018,4,ENJOYED STAYING HERE,"Nice staff,clean room,very comfortable bed.Especially liked the plush terry robe after showering!Also ate several meals in the restaurant which were excellent.Delicious Harira(a typical Moroccan soup.)"
 December 2018,5,Good,"The location of this hotel is great withing walking distance ti many sights and restaurants. Nice staff ,good service,confort sleep. The breakfast was good with a lot of choices. Thank you very much .i will turn back again. Hihly recimmended."
 December 2018,2,Mediocre,"Where to start? The good: -room was clean - everything was stocked - nice little Juliet balcony - quite pretty The bad: - dingy towels and robes, not white and overly worn out. Gross. - other than the old hairdryer there is ONE outlet in my room. Substandard. There‚Äôs not even one by the bed! Only one room key, key maker broken (so when you leave the AC is off and you return to a muggy room) - AC is not good, had to leave window open to balcony for air which is noisy - No hotel store so if you forget something you‚Äôre out of luck If I was paying less, I‚Äôd be more tolerant, but at the price I expect better than this. It‚Äôs okay but lackluster."
 December 2018,4,Nice hotel,"This was a clean, updated hotel with very polite staff. I liked the spacious lobby with beautiful stonework. Room was clean and the bidet was a nice tough. It appears every room has their own balcony."
 October 2018,4,Le Diwan,"Very decent hotel, good location as well. If you walk straight from the main entrance in 5 min you will get to the Royal Palace on the left and Art museum on the right. If you turn right after museum and follow the main street in about 15 min you will get to the endless city market. If you will walk from the hotel in opposite direction in about 15-20 min you will get to Hassan Tower."
 December 2018,3,Perfectly adequate - nothing special,"Our room smelled of mildew. One of our party needed to relocate for this reason. Elevators are quite small and do not always stop evenly with the floor. We had problems with the lighting system - there is a card, a button and the switches. You must use all three. This was never explained. I complained at the the desk and no one responded. Bed was very comfortable. But bath/shower required a high step to enter and exit and could be difficult for persons with hip or knee problems."
 November 2018,4,Gate 1 1st Night in Morocco!,"We stayed here 1 night on our recent Gate 1 Tour of Morocco. Le Diwan is a decent tourist/business class hotel in the middle of the Rabat Medina. Its an easy walk to many landmarks although we did not venture out of the hotel. Rooms were on the smaller side, as ours only had a double bed. Bed was comfortable with plenty of pillows and blankets.TV was big and remote was easy to use. There were a few English language channels to choose from. Bathroom was clean and the shower was European tub.shower combo which something to be desired. We had dinner in the hotel and it was buffet style and good, but not very Moroccan. Breakfast in the AM was good. The hotel bar was quiet and reasonably priced with local wines about $7 a glass. Not a bad crash spot for our first night in‚Ä¶"
 November 2018,3,Our bedroom smelled of mildew and elevator suspect,But the breakfast was the best and the staff tried hard. Smoking in the bar was overwhelming. Door man helped us with the petite cabs. Overall an average hotel. The elevator should have been replaced a decade ago.
 November 2018,5,The heart of town,"a wonderful experience, very well centered h√¥tel, easy access to most touristic attractions. Very professional and friendly staff from the doorman up, and the food is just out of this world. All in all a wonderful experience in hospitality. Keep up the good work."
 November 2018,5,Great,"This was the first time i came here And it was a great experience , the hole crew Were welcoming and all smiling with clients , the breakfast was delicious with a lot of options right at the Time, I will absolutely Go There For An other Visit , Recommend The place."
 October 2018,4,Good Start to our Tour,"We stayed at Le Diwan for 2 nights at the start of a Gate 1 tour. The hotel is in a busy part of Rabat, about a 15-minute walk from the market in the Medina, with other shops along the way. The tram runs right past the hotel, though the nearest tram stop is a few blocks away. We had a good dinner in the hotel restaurant. The breakfast buffet, however, was only so-so in my view. The bed and pillows were particularly comfortable, and the shower worked well. Free WiFi is available in the rooms, but I found that it had a tendency to fade in and out. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful."
 May 2018,5,Loved it!,Excellent service and behavior from all the stuffs around the hotel. Really would love to visit again soon. Enjoyed our time with whole family there and it was such a wonderful experience. The food was also great.
 October 2018,5,A visit to remember,As soon as i entered the restaurant I had a very positive vibe. Loved the ambience. Every stuff was co-operative and very nice. The steak was perfectly made just exactly how I wanted to be. Everyone made me feel so comfortable that i cant wait to visit this place again. Indeed a great place to come with your family and friends. Great team work I must say. Thank you for your extraordinary service.
 October 2018,5,Great experience,"I had a very good stay at le diwan and the staff was very welcoming and Nice, the restaurant was an amazing experience, next time i Will ask To try the spa,i would recommend the pinky mojito at the bar."
 October 2018,1,No Way!,Thank goodness it was only one night. The smell of mold and mustiness was overpowering. The feeling of the room not being clean was always present. The area dirty and walking anywhere was not encouraged. Ignore their website. The hotel needs a major facelift.
 October 2018,4,Convenient Location,"This was our first hotel of a 10 day tour of Morocco. Finely presented, rooms were excellent, breakfast was good, I heard from members of our group the restaurant food was exceptional. For me it was ideal near little local restaurants for those who don't want to go far, lttle convenience store, less than a half mile walk to the palace, the avenue, the medina. Follow the shuttle/ trolley tracks as a short cut to the avenue and a short walk from there to the Medina. We went to Restaurant 3.0 just out to the right and then turn right again along the tracks...immediately on the left. Owned by a French couple, food was magnificent!"
 October 2018,4,Brief but good stay,"I have had good experiences with M Gallery hotels, and this one was fine too. We had a brief 1 night stay, arriving late afternoon and leaving early next morning. So while the location didnt appeal to me (it was right on a very busy intersection), it didn't impact on us. Our room was small but clean and comfortable with no issues. We had a 3 course dinner in the restaurant and it was excellent. And breakfast the next morning had something for everyone."
 October 2018,1,Awful,We are staying in the Hotel Le Diwan as part of a group tour. An old hotel is fine but this one is decrepit. The granite around the sink is cracking and so is the grout. What I find most disgusting is the lack of cleanliness in my room. Everything is dirty or dusty. It looks like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in weeks I would never stay here on my own
 October 2018,5,Perfect getaway,"I have spent a marvellous time in this hotel, upon arrival check-in was so fast, the staff were so warm and welcoming. The room was spaceous and very clean. I had amenities and free water, the staff were absolutely adorable, especially Nora from breakfast who made my stay very special by her kindness and professional attitude. I definitely recommend this hotel, will be back soon"
 October 2018,3,Nice hotel but some rude staff.,"We stayed here for 2 days while in Rabat. The room was nice and clean. We had a problem with a female manager literally yelling at the top of her voice at us for getting some of the free juice they offered. She said that we were not allowed any since it was only for new arrivals. We did not know this but thought it was just complementary from the hotel. Other than her, all staff was friendly. We won‚Äôt be staying at this hotel again."
 October 2018,5,Wonderful bed !,"After a long day travelling from Chefchauoen it was great to check in to this hotel. Very welcoming staff, well appointed room with everything one needs when travelling, but the bed ! It was how I imagine sleeping on a cloud would be like. Soft, luxurious, as soon as I hit the bed after dinner I didn't know a thing until it was time to get up. Very good breakfast with all you need and more plus attentive staff to pour your coffee ! I am sure you won't do better than the Hotel Le Dirwan when you visit Rabat. And, the reception staff are multi lingual so there are no communication problems."
 October 2018,4,2 Nights in Rabat,"This hotel provides a great location to navigate Rabat by foot. Within a 5 minute walk to the Museum of Contemporary Art as well as the Museum of Civilization. 30 min (or so) walk to the Atlantic Coast. Everything between the hotel and the coast is what you want to see. The room is comfortable and clean. There are 2 closets, a desk, a sitting chair and a small balcony. The restroom has a shower/bath combo and offered a hair dryer as well. Across the street and next door are 3 or 4 different banks with ATMs. The hotel restaurant I hear is quite good. I will be trying it this evening."
 September 2018,3,Ok,Spent two nights here. Rooms were dated and the bed mattress was extremely firm and I like a firm mattress. The hotel has a lobby bar and there are many ATM‚Äôs near the hotel. The buffet breakfast was adequate but nothing special.
 September 2018,3,Nice small hotel - 94 rooms,"We stayed two nights are this hotel. There was free Wi-Fi, good air-conditioning, mini-bar, spa, safe, hair dryer, balcony, tea and coffee. There was a small balcony, but no chairs or table. The hotel needed a good cleaning, the bathroom needed some work, and was somewhat dated. Staff was very nice. It was centrally located and easy to get around. Breakfast was excellent."
 September 2018,2,Not The Best,When I arrived in the lobby it had an outdated look. The small lobby was cluttered with bicycles and acrylic cases holding purses. It could use a good cleaning. I used the rest room in the lobby and gunk was on the wall. My room smelled so musty I had to request a new one. It still was musty but tolerable. The air conditioning was minimal and did not really cool the room. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this hotel.
 September 2018,5,So good,WE stayed 2people and a baby in the h√¥tel. Diwan is the perfect place to spend quality Time with family or in a couple The food is absolutely fantastic and th√© place clean and authentic. Staff is incredibly nice and helpful . WE would recommend this place to anyone intrested in enjoying a quiet Time in rabat.
 September 2018,3,ok But not 4 star,"Although this hotel looks great in the photos, other than the lobby, I am not sure where any of those bedrooms are. The restaurant is good. The rooms are very clean, the bathroom is ok but our bath needed some repair work. The staff was great and helped you out if needed. The elevators are a 4 person or 2 person with luggage."
 November 2017,4,Great Hotel,Stayed here for two nights during a tour of Morocco. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The hotel staff...all professional and polite. The location was not ideal...not close to major attractions. They serve a lot of tour groups...so a rather busy hotel. The breakfast buffet was good with a variety of food.
 June 2018,5,Great,"Perfect location on the city centre n As they say "" service from the heart"" They have a great team very helpful staff and such a wonderful reception from the check-in to chek-out. Good breakfast with smiling staff. Thanks i will come back as soon as i can."
 May 2018,3,Clean Hotel,"This hotel is not in a great location if you are a tourist. While you are within about a 15 minute walk to Mohamad V blvd, the hotel itself is right on a roundabout with heavy traffic and nothing nearby that is suitable for tourists. The purpose of this hotel in this particular location escapes me. The hotel itself is small, but very clean and most of the staff was very friendly. The housekeeper did open the door and just walk in while I was still in the room and I found that uncomforting. The room however was clean, we did not have our towels replenished on our second day. The food in the hotel is average fair. Nothing that you are going to remember either well or poorly."
 March 2018,4,very nice modern hotel,"the location is terrific in the middle of the town and easy walking distance to anything the hotel food was terrific and the room were lovely.and very modern, there is lots to do in the area of the hotel as well"
 May 2018,4,Stay at Hotel Le Diwan Hotel,"We stayed two nights at the hotel. The first night was on our own and the second was included in our tour with the Overseas Adventure Travel tour group. When we arrived, we were almost overcome by the extremely sweet smell of the flowers that decorated the lobby. If you have an allergy to that sort of thing, you should stay somewhere else. We came in late at night and were very tired, but the staff was wonderful and kind through the check in procedure and the whole time we were there. The breakfasts were good. The hotel was clean, and we would definitely stay there again."
 May 2018,5,Very nice,Diwan is a very good hotel.good food .the atmosphere during the evening at the bar With candle light is very nice.i really apreciated the excellent service and the breakfast.thank you very much we will turn again.
 May 2018,5,‚ÄòWow experience‚Äô,Visited their buffet restaurant for Iftar. I am very satisfied with the food varieties and quality. Totally met my expectations. Their hospitality is also well appreciated. Service associates smiling face made the evening. I will definitely come back here.
 June 2017,4,Second Visit- Pleasant stay!,"Visited Le Diwan Rabat second time within 1 year. It was pleasant stay as my previous visit. Hotel is centrally located. It was a nice touch that they put mini sweets/pastries in the bedroom in the evening. The rooms were spotless and the bed was comfortable, though washrooms are small. Hotel restaurant is good but costly. There are good and cheaper options available nearby."
 May 2018,3,One night was enough,Room was ok. Difficult to avoid water spray on the floor from the shower over the bath. Pillows too soft and lifts are slow and wonky. Poor service at breakfast and ordering an omelette seemed to be an ordeal for staff member.
 April 2018,5,Fabulous and helpful customer service,Staff was extraordinary and really went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. They made great suggestions as to places to visit and checked in with us on our return to see how we enjoyed ourselves.
 April 2018,2,"Great spa, stay elsewhere","I stayed with some friends and we really enjoyed our hammam scrub and massage at the spa in the hotel. Unfortunately, two of my friends had their locked luggage broken into. Nothing valuable was missing, but the zippers were separated and no longer work properly. Upon checkout I asked to pay for an item that was missing from the minibar. I explained that I had not taken anything during my stay, so the charge was removed. The air conditioning did not work in the rooms, so we were glad to visit during a cooler time. Breakfast was very nice with plenty of options and omelets. We had confirmed an airport pickup that did not show up. I‚Äôve stayed at a few other hotels in Morocco and the Le Diwan does not measure up in terms of quality and hospitality."
 April 2018,4,A Nice Hotel in a Good Location,"Frankly, we were delighted to be in our room at Le Diwan, after four plane flights and coping with the Air France strike action. Later we noticed that the room was comfortable, well appointed and in an excellent location. The lobby was cheerful with flowers which appealed to plane-wilted travelers, and the reception desk even gave my sister a small bouquet of roses when they discovered the day was her birthday. The hotel is located across from a bank and an ATM and only several blocks from both the Art Gallery and the Museum of Archaeology/Civilization that houses the antiquities from Volubilis. Just remember, if you walk there, that Rabat drivers think zebra crossing crosswalks are merely decoration on the road. Cross at the stop lights, preferably with Rabat citizens who‚Ä¶"
 April 2018,4,"Good hotel, but not quite the level I expect for an MGallery Hotel","This hotel looks great from outside, but could use an upgrade of the rooms and bathrooms. Friendly staff, though the room cleaning staff should speak better French, rather than almost exclusively Darija! Restaurant was enjoyable with a good selection for lunch and dinner. The breakfast options fell short of my expectations and staff in the breakfast restaurant could be friendlier."
 April 2018,4,"Good location, Comfortable Bed, Friendly Staff","No complaints at all about the bed (really comfy) or the staff (really friendly) or the location (very central and near many things). Only down sides were elevators slow and not working properly and the bad breakfast!! Rotten fruit and moldy cheese! Perhaps it was just because this breakfast was early for our tour group, but it seemed like some of it had been left out or something."
 May 2017,3,Very Pleasant place Welcoming Staff But ....!!,"The Hotel has a beautiful reception and Grounds to match. Professional Front desk "" Young Receptionist"" Very friendly Management ,both gentleman and lady in the front desk are communicative and very helpful, doorman ,security and all of them were fantastic.I was there me and my wife, once we get to the hotel, I was struggling with parking area, when I found a spot beside the hotel, then it came from nowhere an old man blocking my way asking for money in order to park my car after,after 20 minute of arguments and inappropriate insults finally the doorman find a spot for me, it was very stressful to deal with that old man ( he was illegally taking advantage of that space ) well, after all, it wasn't the hotel's mistake, but hope if they can fix that parking issues. Rooms were‚Ä¶"
 March 2018,5,"Comfortable, well located hotel",Small things matter a lot. The WiFi was outstanding everywhere in the hotel. Was able to monitor some important events back home. The hotel front desk staff was very helpful. The room was spotless. Breakfast buffet had a variety of fresh fruit and pastries. The room was quiet and the bed comfortable.
 March 2018,4,This 4 star hotel in Rabat has comfortable rooms and is clean and well located in Rabat.,We stayed at this 4 star rated hotel in downtown Rabat for one night only during a busy visit to Morocco. It is probably a popular hotel for business people visiting this capital city of Morocco. Rooms were okay size wise and beds were comfortable enough.
 April 2017,5,"""Absolutly Amazing"" Excellent Hotel","This was my Husband first time staying in Rabat and we really enjoyed our selves. Breakfast had good variety of choices, and staff were very accommodating. Noura Miriam, Yassin they was excellent. Room attended was very helpful. Front desk staff and Security men's were very courteous and helpful. We can not wait for our return stay in May 2018. Inch'allah"
 March 2018,4,Comfortable & Clean,"Very well located in Rabat. Easy check in. Our room was on the top floor with a nice view. Our room was spacious , clean and comfortable. Bathroom was comfortable, the bathtub into the shower is high to get into, not bad but be aware of. Bidet is a nice touch. Beds were comfortable and the comforter was nice and warm. Things to consider this hotel does a lot of business with tour groups so be aware of large groups that could be there. Staff is very friendly. Nice intimate bar with great staff. Restaurant for dinner was very good. We had a fish dish with a brown flavorful sauce and a salad that was wonderful. Breakfast buffet is a breakfast buffet, nuff said."
 February 2018,5,Nice Start,"It was our first night in Morocco and I couldn't understand why after a long international flight we would travel 2 more hours to Rabat. I'm glad that we did! The Le Diwan was a wonderful way to start our visit to Morocco and Rabat is much calmer and cleaner than Casablanca. The first night we dined in the hotel restaurant. The soup was delicious! The wait staff was very friendly. The room was clean and well equipped. Breakfast was bountiful albeit a bit hectic with spotty service (not enough coffee, had to ask for utensils), but there was about 40 of us on the bus tour that bombarded the room all at once. There are some restaurants within walking distance and taxi service is readily available and reasonable."
 March 2018,1,Terrible is understated,"Booked a double room for 1 night and due to unforeseen circumstances I was not able to make it with my wife. Even-tough the reservation was guaranteed with a Visa card, Accor platinum membership status with all my details and a phone call to verify all the details, my wife was not permitted to check in because the reservation is under my name. Its really disgusted that they treat women so disrespectfully. Eventually, i cancelled the reservation after minutes of arguing with the Front desk manager on the phone to allow my wife to check in because it‚Äôs very late and look to at as a humanitarian case but with no success. They promised not to charge me no-show. Let‚Äôs wait and see!!!!! Accor should watch out for there properties in Morocco. This is the second Accor property among top‚Ä¶"
 February 2018,4,Short Stay,Had a one night short stay at this hotel. Arrived on a Sunday for a start of my Morocco tour and most business was close. Hotel was nice and small. Room was clean and nice size. My only concern was there was no peep hole for the door. I was a little concerned when having to open the door late night for room service.
 March 2018,5,Good,Wonderful dining am loving it. Its a great place I love it. Great hospitality. Sure worth visit. People are great and places and roads are awesome. Do visit . I will come back soon. I love the food. Bhago .
 January 2018,4,Very comfortable,"The only real negative was the smoke in the lobby (there is a bar in the lobby and smoking is a normal thing there). Otherwise very comfortable, very nice staff, good rooms. Location is in a business district--but it is possible to walk to some nice and interesting areas. We also had dinner in the restaurant and it was quite good. Not Moroccan food, but good flavors. There is no special charm to this hotel--more modern than quaint."
 February 2018,5,"Great service, great location","This is an ideal hotel for your stay in Rabat. Staff extremely helpful, and friendly, making your stay a joy. There is a great bar area, with live music regularly, the adjoining restaurant has a good varied menu, and breakfast service is very good with an excellent selection. Rooms are comfortable, well equipped with a good bathroom. Would highly recommend."
 January 2018,5,Nice hotel and location,"Nice location! Easy 15 minute walk to the Medina, nice, safe neighborhood. Spacious, clean room. We had a small balcony on our front side room. Breakfast was good, plenty of food and choices. Bar in the lobby. Staff were all friendly and accommodating. Would recommend!"
 January 2018,4,Pretty Good!,"Nice hotel with friendly staff; some English, mostly fresh speaking. The rooms are lovely with nice beds, sheets and pillows and excellent water pressure in the shower. The air conditioning doesn‚Äôt work that well and to open the window is just too noisy with the street traffic. Our package included a breakfast buffet and had all the basics, eggs, sausages, fresh and canned fruit, yogurt, cheese and meats. They also have coffee. Order a cappuccino if you want milk - but it‚Äôs not really a cappuccino with foam. The hotel has several ATMs outdid to the left and right of the hotel to exchange money."
 January 2018,5,Comfortable Well Located Hotel With Good Staff,"We stayed here two nights. We had dinner in their restaurant the first night and had a terrific meal, with a great starter Moroccan Salad and a Salmon dish that was outstanding. We had a bottle of Moroccan wine recommended to us by the waiter which was very good and only about US$30. Our room was on the first floor button noisy at all. Comfortable bed and nice desk to work at. Good storage. Staff was very helpful"
 January 2018,5,Excellent Hotel & Service!,"I stayed at this hotel on my first stop with a tour group visiting Morocco and we received the most amazing welcome from the hotel staff. All of the staff was so attentive and the hotel atmosphere was superb. My friend and I had our luggage delayed by the airline, and the hotel manager went above and beyond providing us with complimentary shirts and some basic essentials to get us by until our baggage arrived. The restaurant food was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. The rooms were cozy. I slept like a baby! Breakfast was great. There was a wonderful variety of breads and the Moroccan soup was a hit in my book. We didn‚Äôt have enough time to try the spa services, but the people in our group that did said it was fabulous service. I am so grateful that this was the‚Ä¶"
 January 2018,5,Le Diwan,"Amazing. This hotel and staff go above and beyond. Air France lost my luggage leaving me without clothing, toiletries and daily necessities. It is very scary to be in a new country without your luggage. The first night in the hotel we were talking with staff about our situation and disappointment with our airlines. Turns out the man we were speaking with was the general manager (Alaa Squalli) of the hotel. When we went back to our room we found two new (AC/DC) shirts on our beds, slippers and robes. We were also given a toothbrush and toothpaste. Just that made us feel more relaxed and cared for. We had clean clothes to wear the next day and a robe to wear to bed. The next day, one of the other employees (Noura) commented on our shirts and asked about our situation. Turns out‚Ä¶"
 January 2018,3,Nice Neat Boutique Hotel,Room small but functional. Good shower. WiFi good at first but spotty at times. Fairly good location within walking distance to museums and M√©dina. Restaurant attractive with a limited number of selections.
 November 2017,5,Kim and Richard k from Canada,"The staff provided exceptional service over our two week stay. Friendly, welcoming , caring and ready to help in any way. The breakfast is outstanding as are the breakfast staff exceptional. Noura and her team are amazing. The front desk staff are extremely helpful and made excellent recommendations for visiting the city . We loved our stay and will look forward to return. We enjoyed the beautiful art, good food , professional environment and good location. 5 star service!!!!!"
 December 2017,3,Rough/tired hotel with great staff,This hotel is nicely situated and there are quite a few restaurants in walking distance. The Kasbah and even Chellah ruins are within a 1 to 1 1/2 mile walking distance. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast was decent. We stayed for two nights. We had two rooms on the fifth floor. The carpet in the hallway was absolutely the worst I have seen in a hotel especially considering this is Sofitel. There were large spots on the carpet and it looked really old. Same thing for the room carpet. The lobby and hallways are also a little dark. Overall it‚Äôs okay but would have liked to stay at the other Sofitel.
 December 2017,5,Morocco trip,"Spent 2 nights at hotel as the first stop in our Morooccan tour. It was a very long day of travel so it was wonderful relax in the well appointed rooms. Breakfast provided a variety of options even for the vegans in the group. Had a marvelous time at the hotel lounge making friends and having a good time singing and dancing. Great location, very nice rooms and the awesome staff made our short stay memorable."
 December 2017,4,Business trip,Very convenient hotel for few days business trip. Very helpful staff! Restaurant offers very nice French/Moroccan food with good selection. Parking area could be a bit bigger and its difficult to drive in directly from roundabout.
 December 2017,5,Great Staff,"very nice stay in the hotel, even if it was just for 3 days but it was a sweet experience in terms of pretty much everything even the smallest details, cosy rooms after a long tiring day nd a cool view over the neighbourhood nd that low light bar downstairs is just perfect . overall a ""Great Stay"".."
 December 2017,5,Excellent,I appreciate really the great and personal service of the staff . Definitely coming back and recommending the hotel 100/. Thanks for all the great food I enjoyed and the talking with the people working there who were very kind in different levels
 November 2017,4,Nice hotel is a good location in Rabat,We stayed here as part of a tour group. The rooms were very clean and nice. The breakfast was very good with lots of options. The location worked well being on a main thoroughfare and just a few blocks from the main part of the city. There are 3 banks just across the street so getting local currency is easy. There are several nice restaurants near by.
 October 2017,4,Well located downtown Hotel,Employees were very helpful and the location excellent. Our Moroccan trip began here and it was a good place to start. We walked to most everything or took a cab for $2. Negotiate BEFORE you get in the cab. Imane & Badr were especially helpful when our friend was ill.
 October 2017,4,Good location with friendly staff,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights with a Gate 1 tour. The lobby is small but the staff were friendly and helpful. The location is near resturants and banks for those needing an ATM. On our flight to Morocco a lens of my wife's glasses came out and we could not get it back, In coming into Rabat we notices an optical shops which happened to be a block from the hotel. The man at the shop quickly fixed the glasses-without charge. The hotel is also a good place to learn to negotiate traffic in the large cities of Morocco, where pedestrians do not have the right of way"
 October 2017,4,Good Location,Travelling with a group so check in was quick. Rooms were large and clean. Breakfast was very good with a wide variety to choose. Staff were friendly and quick to answer any questions. Centrally located with several nice restaurants within walking distance.
 November 2017,5,Our favorite hotel of our tour!,"This was the nicest hotel that we stayed at on our Gate 1 tour of Morroco. It had a quiet elegance and charm and was centrally located close to attractions and numerous great restaurants. Staff was very friendly and spoke good English. The rooms were spacious enough and included a stocked minibar and a couple free bottles of water. The beds were the most comfortable we slept in during our time in Morroco and the air conditioning worked well for us warm blooded Americans in Morocco's ""cold season."" Room was a little small and on the darker side. Would certainly stay again and recommend it to anyone. Only downside is their breakfast is astronomically expensive. Definitely google a locally owned place where you'll get a delicious meal for a fraction of the cost."
 November 2017,4,"Location, Location: Le Diwan","We stayed at Le Diwan Rabat with Gate 1. The company takes pride in choosing properties that are centrally located and this hotel is no exception. We drove 1 1/2 hours after landing in Casablanca so the first order of business was to exchange money. There are three banks across the (very busy) street. As a sidebar, friends wanted to change USD but most banks do not provide this service. Instead, you need to go to an exchange office. I used the ATM with no difficulty. Rabat Exchange, a short walk from the hotel has favorable rates. Our room was clean and comfortable although small. The entry way has an inset place to put a suitcase; a luggage rack also is available. We appreciated the kettle for morning tea and the small balcony for a view of the city. Adequate toiletries,‚Ä¶"
 October 2017,4,Nice place to stay,"The room was very adequate, nice, clean and comfortable. The breakfast spread was more than enough. The staff very friendly. The stairs up to rooms, no handrail. Used elevator. The room had a door that opened onto a patio with plants and such. Probably during earlier months would have been place to sit. Able to get map and directions at Lobby Reception. There is no traditional gift shop. There are on display things you can buy, but they are high end. No washcloth in bath (but that is typical of any lodging in this country). Hair dryer included, and it worked well."
 October 2017,5,Good hotel,"Very good hotel ,good service .excellent sttaf.im from egypt .i came here with my freinds for a conferrence.very tasty food.thank you very much for your help.i will come back again.thanks a lot.see you next year."
 October 2017,4,Nice Gem in Rabat,"Traveled as part of a group tour. Immediate check in and helpful front desk. Room was just the right size with bathrobe, slippers, and bathroom amenities. Room could use updating but it was clean. Really well located about 20 minutes walking from the Medina. Lots of restaurants nearby. Breakfast was kind of sparse but adequate."
 October 2017,4,Good hotel but WATCH OUT AT CHECKOUT- 3% charge unless you tell them not in $US,This is a pleasant and well located hotel. Good food in restaurant. But they fooled us at checkout by not asking if we wanted the charge in Moroccan currency or $US with a 3% charge. Our Capital One Visa doesn't charge for the conversion.
 October 2017,5,Comfy Hotel Experience,I was not expecting such a personalized service since i had a language barrier but the staff made me go WOW with their personalized service. The breakfast buffet and our dinner at La brasserie was just Amazing and something that i crave for after coming back. The rooms were very clean and tidy. The staff were always there to help and to make us feel comfortable. Loved their drinks at the lobby. Luckily when we were staying there we could enjoy a fabulous painting exhibition. I will come back again to Rabat for Le Dewan.
 September 2017,5,Great stay in September,"Very nice, comfortable room. The staff were all incredible; so helpful and friendly. Breakfast was wonderful. Hotel is within walking distance to a variety of places of interest. Would stay here again. BGC, from Texas"
 September 2017,5,Amazing,"We have stayed at the hotel many times, it is like a home as the staff are so wonderful. From the cleaners to the chef to the managers.... best hotel and takes care of you. The rooms are nice and clean, cleaned well daily, breakfast is fresh and to die for, staff are pleasant they know English and communicate politely. The location is great- walking distance to the centre, a few places around to get food."
 September 2017,2,Over rated!,"We had a group booking for an international event. We received lots of complaints. Location is probably OK but the hotel is definitely over-rated. People complained about quality of the rooms, not always clean, bad smell, service so so.., especially given the high price $$$. This is definitely not the best deal you can get n Rabat; see for instance my previous reviews about other places in Rabat."
 September 2017,4,Nice hotel in good location,Most of the staff was helpful and patient with many tourists. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Overall the hotel is typical of 3-4 star European hotels. The restaurant was good with nice service and a decent bar menu. I would recommend for English or French-speaking travelers.
 October 2017,4,Excellent Service,Stayed here for just 1 night. Service was excellent--every member of the staff I spoke to was very kind and friendly. Very welcoming front desk staff. I ate 2 meals here and they were both great. Would definitely stay here if in Rabat again.
 October 2017,3,Struggling for a four star,Lobby area is tired. Service is excellent and staff are responsive. The break just made it reasonable. We were part of a tour group. Location is good as it's close to everything. These words are to make up the 200 minimum.
 March 2017,4,Good Hotel,It‚Äôs a good hotel. The food and service was good. The rooms are small. The hotel seems old but well maintained and the staff were friendly and helpful. They provide morrocan delights in the room everyday.
 September 2017,4,"Good hotel, but not luxury","The hotel was fine -- I stayed here for 5 days for a set of meetings in Rabat, but I would not call it a luxury hotel. The hallways smelled musty and like disinfectant -- the room was OK after I aired it out. The room, including the bathroom, was clean and nice. I had called and booked the hotel shuttle from the airport so that I would not have to deal with any hassles. I was met with a taxi driver with a sign with my name. It was fine until we got to the hotel and then before I went in, he wanted money. I hadn't changed money and was expecting to be billed through the hotel since I didn't know the price. He came inside with me and I was told it was cheaper to pay him directly, so I changed money and did so. But it wasn't as painless as I had hoped. The first night,‚Ä¶"
 September 2017,5,First breakfast in Rabat.,Great hotel. Friendly staff. For a first time traveler it is a warm welcoming place. Thank you Noura. Recommend it highly. Start of our OAT TOUR. If I have to write more to submit TripAdvisor then I won't be making a lot of reviews.
 April 2017,4,Good business hotel,"I stayed in room 411 for a couple nights as part of a group tour. The room was decent size, nicely appointed and had plenty of space. There was a king bed, a mini refrigerator, desk and a small table and chair. The bathroom had a tub/shower combination, along with a separate toilet room. Both the wi fi and air conditioning were good. The hotel was in walking distance to restaurants and a couple museums. Breakfast was good. We didn't have any other meals here. I would recommend this hotel for a couple nights in Rabat."
 September 2017,3,"Fine for a short stay, but pricey in high season and so-so quality","I don't like griping, and this place is fine (good location). But the rooms are musty (ash-trays in the rooms are not a good sign), the windows don't fit (so traffic noise filters in). The staff are fine, but the breakfast is pretty uninspired and the restaurant service is soooooo slow. Given quite high peak season prices, I'm sure there are better places to stay in."
 July 2017,3,Jost Hotel 4 Your Busines.,"Address: Place de l'unite Africaine, 10000, Rabat, Moroc 1- Time of Check in Good. 2- Reception Good. 3- Room service very Good 4- View to the Road. There's not view to the garden or swimming pool. 5- if you are going for courses, seminars and business in city very good choise maximum 2 days enough or you got boring."
 August 2017,4,"Helpful Staff, Welcomed Hotel Experience After Riad-ing","After spending time in a riad in steamy Marrakesh, we were thrilled to arrive at essentially a commercial hotel chain. The Diwan is a clean, modernish hotel located in the heart of Rabat. The staff was very kind and helpful and they even offered free parking (a rarity in Morocco). Close in proximity to the Hassan Tower and Ruins. Recommended!"
 August 2017,3,Nice staff,"Nice staff, good service, comfort sleep, good breakfast, but antic furniture and strong volatile detergent smell in room. Coffee Machine available and good, mini bar OK, Hammam in SPA is very good., Parking is difficult, but if you stop around in vision to staff, they will bring your car to parking and leave your key at reception."
 November 2016,4,Mrs Liliana,"Small hotel with spa and conference room, the hotel isvin a busy sector og town but nearby the medina.Room are nice but ask for the one along the corridor so less noisy, very clean atmosphere, nice restaurant and full bar."
 July 2017,4,"Small, centrally located hotel","This hotel is a good choice for business or for travelers. It is clean and everyone that works there was friendly and helpful. There is no gym or pool, although there is a restaurant and bar. It is within walking distance of the train station, restaurants, shopping, and the medina, as well as an art museum."
 April 2017,4,good location,I visited Rabat with my husband in business trip for 4 night. the hotel is clean and the staff is super friendly and helpful. it is close to the old city and most of the attractions. size of the room and bathroom is small. and last thing never miss the hammam in the spa it worth the money.
 July 2017,4,Puzzled with the service,"I still haven't decided how I feel about the service at this hotel. On one hand, the concierge was very helpful and ran to the shops to get cigarettes for me (I was too lazy to go), and even called me to see which ones I wanted as the brand I originally asked for wasn't in the shop. Commendable, right? On the other hand, the breakfast that I ordered by placing the card on the room door arrived 50 minutes late after I chased it and then told them to cancel it as it was too late and i had to leave. They still added it onto my bill! (although the reception, removed it after i explained what had happened). It took me a several phone calls to spa, reception, spa, reception again in order to reserve a spa treatment as they did not speak English, but the hammam I had was divine -‚Ä¶"
 March 2017,4,Great location in Rabat,"The location of this hotel is great. Within walking distance to many sights and restaurants. The rooms were clean, my only complaint is that there was no wife in the rooms and you had to sit in the lobby to get a connection."
 May 2017,4,Commendable Hotel.,"I stayed here for two nights with a tour group and found the hotel to be very commendable. All the staff members I met were polite and nice. My room was clean and a good size; I also had a view of the street below which I liked since I got to see everyday life in Rabat. The bed and pillows were also comfortable- I slept soundly, but it might have been because I was tired. I also tried the hotel restaurant and enjoyed my meal there. The hotel itself is showing its age, but it's in a very nice location- we walked around the neighborhood to see some sites and felt very safe doing it, there were also some restaurants and stores that were walking distance. The only aspect of my stay I didn't like was the eggs for breakfast- almost inedible (runny, not sure how it was cooked‚Ä¶"
 July 2017,4,Clean rooms and comfortable beds,"First room was boiling, air-conditioning broken! Engineer could not fix, they swapped rooms fairly easily for me then it was perfectly cool in the room. Would be good if hotel manager could ensure rooms are fit for purpose before guests arrive as my colleague arrived the day after as I did at midnight & his room also had broken air conditioning too! Le Diwan you need to ensure to check the rooms before receiving your guest to avoid them having a poor unnecessary experience! Once settled room was spotlessly clean and breakfast was plenty!"
 January 2017,1,Don't do it,Horrible I had to change the rooms 3 times and I waited to check in about 30 min because they couldn't find the confirmation. The rooms have no internet even thou they claim that they do also it's not a good hotel location
 April 2017,4,Excellent Hotel with Great Service,"We spent two nights here and were quite satisfied. Our room was clean, modern and large and had all the amenities we expected. The staff went out of their way to take care of our needs. The breakfast buffet was large, varied and delicious. The hotel location is pretty central and easy to get to other things in the city. Highly recommended."
 June 2017,5,Enjoyable hotel with amazing staff!,"I booked a 3 nights stay during the holy month with couple friends. Such a lovely place located in the center of rabat . The staff are surprisingly kind and helpful and will guide you throughout your stay and will cater all your needs . The rooms are quite very tidy and clean ,the bed is easy to fall asleep in ( must be the sheets ) What i liked the most was the ramadan iftar , at noon each day, I filled my plate with delicious nourishing and filling moroccan traditional foods. I would recommend the hotel as the best in Rabat. The only problem was with the small parking, had to park my car outside the hotel."
 June 2017,3,a pleasant hotel,"I stayed in Le Diwan hotel in central Rabat on a business trip last week. It is well placed both for business and tourism, being near Parliament, Government ministries and within walking distance of the King Mohammed VI modern art gallery, the archaeological museum, and not too far from the medina. My room was a reasonable size, with a balcony which caught the morning sun, and was quiet and comfortable - even if the decor was a little sombre. At beakfast, the variety of fruit, cheese, meat, pastries and bread was lovely; but the cooked breakfast was not the best, and not very warm. On two mornings, there was competition at breakfast with dozens of military men in a wide variety of colourful uniforms. Great to watch, but they descended on the food like gannets and most of it‚Ä¶"
 May 2017,3,"Clean room,clean bathroom","first, when overseas, never try to compare the attention to details from American hotels to overseas hotels, they have different standards of their own. I was part of a large tour group, a lot of this hotels they cater to this company so they handle big groups, therefore, quality and service suffers, because you only there for one to two nights max. the breakfast was simply, it was o.k, make sure you take your voltage adapter/converter with you, they use 220v as an standard out of the outlet. found out the wrong way, burned my hair blower in tow seconds. the Air conditioners barely put any cold air, 75-76F the better, just enough to keep you cool to fall asleep, all the rooms are like that, I asked my fellow travelers."
 April 2017,4,"Nice hotel, good breakfast",Stayed here while on Gate 1 tour - overall I thought this was the nicest hotel we stayed in - room was comfortable as was bed. Breakfast was good. It is within walking distance of the Mosque and Mausoleum and close to several good restaurants.
 May 2017,4,Location is good,"Lobby is pretty small. Room not big either. However, the hotel is nicely located, close to tourist attractions. Lots of ATMs around the hotel. Walking towards museum, after passing museum, you will find many small restaurants. Very good, not expensive."
 May 2017,5,Nice and strategic location,"I strongly recommend this convenient hotel, is nice, affordable, is very close to Rabat highlights, and has an amazing staff very oriented customers The neighborhood is quiet and safe. You can go walking to see places like the museum of art or Hassan Tower. However if you don't want to walk, the tram rail pass just acros the street from the hotel"
 May 2017,3,Filthy Carpet - Bring Your Sandals,"After passing the lobby, you will get the dreaded feel of this old hotel. If you can catch one of the two very small and slow elevators, you will be hit with a foul smell of the hallway floor to your room, and unfortunately into your room. This disgusting smell like a dirty sock is probably due to the disgusting carpet of the hallway and room. The carpet was matted with stains. I would think that a good steam-clean of the carpet would improve the cleanliness of this hotel tremendously. Or replace the old carpet with easy to clean tiles, as they have already done in the bathroom area. So in the mean time, bring your sandals as you will not want to walk around barefoot. This hotel caters to large tour groups. And when these groups hit the morning breakfast at the same‚Ä¶"
 April 2017,2,Unprofessional customer service,"We booked a nice 12 days tour in Morocco that was supposed to start with 2 nights at hotel Le Diwan. Because of a very early flight in, we separately booked an extra night. Due to death in the family we had to cancel the whole trip and while we were able to recover most of the money for the trip, the extra first night that we booked directly was not refunded. I understand business is business but it is a bad experience related to this hotel. Customer service seemed blunt and uncaring, not even trying to listen or offer any help."
 May 2017,1,"Close Minded, Worst Customer Service Ive experienced to date - and I am old and travel 75% of the time","Ill make this quick and easy - I cancelled my entire stay for the family after 6 hours in the hotel. The only reason they had 6 hours of my time was to allow my children to sleep after traveling 24 hours non-stop. I have never experienced or seen worse customer service any where in the world. I have only read comments and said that cant be true - it is. The night shift manager and staff categorized my younger wife as my personal escort, who travelled with my 1 year old and 3 year old sons. Because she is a proud Morocco citizen, who decided to show her moroccan passport versus her US credentials, she was immediately categorized and treated wrong before I knew what was happening. After questioning my marriage, and showing passports, visas, green cards, documents with her‚Ä¶"
 April 2017,3,One night only,"Spent only one night at this hotel. Room was okay - if I had needed it, there was a lot of storage and generous sized bathroom. As with all the hotels I stayed at in Morocco the room is a bit worn but was clean and quiet despite the fact my fourth floor room faced the street. The a/c filter needs to be cleaned or replaced as the scent of mold filled the room which, for me, was the only real issue. Enjoyed lunch at the restaurant and drinks at the very dark bar. While taking the stairs down to the lobby, I discovered there are rooms that have a terrace with garden which is lovely. Great location, some sights and restaurants are easily reached on foot. I would stay here again."
 April 2017,4,Good location,"A high rise hotel in agood location within walking distance to many sites. Clean, well-appointed room with nice toiletries. Breakfast was very good, with many choices. Although in the midst of the city, it was very quiet at night."
 April 2017,4,Central location,"The hotel is slightly old and the lobby a bit dark but it is clean with comfortable big sofas which we spread out in as a big group after our drive from Casablanca. Between our tour operators and the hotel reception personnel, the Check In went smooth. We got to our rooms and porters followed with our luggage. The rooms were on the smaller side. Beds very comfortable, no easy chair to sit on so we sat on the edges of our beds. Bathroom good with bidet, which was welcome after the Casablanca hotel. The hotel staff spoke basic English which was good enough. They were able to guide us to Currency Exchange, restaurants, etc. I wanted to book a massage at the spa on the premises but unfortunately they only had one masseuse and with a group as large as ours there was no way‚Ä¶"
 April 2017,4,Nice start for vacation,"The hotel is clean, well appointed, and in a central location. Our room was on an upper floor and faced away from the street, so it was very quiet. The breakfast buffet was good. As seems typical for some Morocco hotels, we received a nice gift of cookies. The only downside on our experience was that smoking is allowed in the downstairs public areas, which you must walk through to get anywhere."
 April 2017,5,Wonderful,The team is very helpful and the hotel is well located . Breakfast was very good Wifi was very fast .Easy to park the car . The room was large and very clean . I recommend this hotel for business trip . Thank you for your help . I will come back again
 April 2017,3,Small rooms without a comfortable chair,"This is supposedly a 5-star Sofitel, but rooms are small and lacking in some essential amenities. There are not outlets by the bed and the hotel is in need of a renovation, as it is of ""aged luxury"". Service only fair, as they got our drink orders wrong and forgot to bring bread several times in bar. The free breakfast was served in a room way too small for the breakfast room with no seats available and the staff was totally overwhelmed. Great beds and very clean. Excellent wifi. Amazingly good Cuban jazz in the lounge and great location."
 December 2016,4,Comfortable and great location,"We stayed here as part of a tour group in December 2016. It was a great selection though because of the location. It was near many banks, restaurants, and the medina wasn't too far of a walk. We were able to walk everywhere. The hotel was nice, standard sized room. Our room felt clean enough for such a hotel. Their breakfast selection was alright. They had plenty of breads and croissants and traditional Moroccan foods. We felt very safe in the neighborhood even walking around after dark. They had all the amenities I was looking for, shampoo, hairdryer, wifi."
 April 2017,4,"Good value, friendly staff, excellent restaurant, but room for improvement","The Diwan is a well decorated hotel with several strong points, and a little room for improvement too. First the strong points: The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. They pre-ordered my taxi to the airport, and arranged for pressing my clothes the same night I arrived (I had a morning business meeting and my suit and shirts were terribly wrinkled during the long flight). Of course, if they had an iron in the room I would have done it myself, but they asked their own staff to do it because the pressing service across the street was already closed, and the hotel did not even charge me for this. The restaurant is a beautiful mix of classical French and art-nouveau decoration; the ceiling boasts a stunning stained glass oval section in the main dining hall. The menu is very‚Ä¶"
 March 2017,4,comfortable with good amenities,The room was clean although it had a few minor issues. A bit small and the tub was very dicey to get into. Good wifi and dinner was outstanding. Breakfast was quite good although heavy on the bread offering which is common apparently in Morocco. Enjoyed my stay. Reasonable and decent massage too.
 March 2017,5,Group Visit Equipe National FRMF,We stayed 3 nights in Hotel Diwan and the hospitality and service of the staff was excellent! The restaurant on the ground floor next to the hotel served a high standard of good healthy and tasty food for our youngsters. I enjoyed our stay and we will definitely be back in the near future.
 March 2017,5,Juste i love it,"Very Nice... In aquile very warm..The food is good...good location...excellent service and very professional staff,Fast response and responsiveness to all requests... In short, in my opinion, for business travel, this is a must in rabat"
 March 2017,5,Superb location,"The location is amazing. First class , great room , service very clean and tidy. The staff are very friendly. . The hotel restaurant is very good .it offers great food. I will come back. Thank you very much."
 March 2017,3,Below expectations...,"This is a nice hotel, well located, but needs some basic improvements. Rooms and restaurant were very hot as A/C was obviously not working... Reported the issue repeatedly at front desk and always said they were going to fix it and never happened. Power outlets in room were in awkward locations, poorly planned, so I had to request an extension cord... They need to fix the basics ..."
 February 2017,4,Good place to stay!,"This hotel was modern, clean and comfortable. There were hair dryers and toiletries in the room and the beds were comfortable. The duvets we slept under got rather warm even though we had the windows open. It would have been nice to have just a sheet. The staff was courteous and friendly and the hotel breakfast was very good."
 January 2017,4,Standard good hotel,"Hotel is well located and well kept. Beds are excellent, and the room amenities are fine. It's a good, relatively small city hotel. Breakfast was fine, and buffet dinner was quite good. It's not an exceptional place, but certainly much better than just serviceable. Staff were helpful and friendly, with decent English."
 September 2016,2,No A/C in September,"The hotel's location was good. The fish served in the hotel's restaurant was delicious! Unfortunately, the next day when I went back to have it again, they were out of it. Our hotel room opened out onto a garden, which was very nice. It was very hot outside and the A/C only blew warm air and the stream of air was hardly blowing. The management sent various staff to our room, but they could not help. They offered us another room, which had a bad odor and also seemed just as warm. They gave us a fan, which was better than nothing, but we sweated all night."
 January 2017,5,Excellent,"We highly liked our staying at Diwan Hotel. The staff was very welcoming with us since the first seconds. They were very helpful, kind and very nice, the reception and also the valet parking. The room is very comfortable with high standing equipments. It was well located, with magnificent view on the Mausoleum of Mohammed V, and located in the upper floors as requested on my reservation. Everything was perfect. It's our second time here and we appreciate this place a lot. We will surely stay here again on our next visit to Rabat."
 February 2017,4,Good Place to Stay,Le Diwan Rabat was a good place to spend the night in Rabat. It's a less than 10 minute walk to the old Medina and there are some lovely cafes and restaurants nearby. It's also very close to the modern art museum. The room and bathroom were decent sized and everything was exceptionally clean. The breakfast was decent - perfect to start off a day of sightseeing.
 February 2017,5,Perfect place to stay in Rabat,"As regular visitors to Rabat, we have found that this hotel is the perfect place to stay. the hotel is central and very comfortable, the staff highly efficient and welcoming, and the restaurant is a highlight with an excellent menu. Definitely a good address in the capital."
 February 2017,5,Great place to stay in a perfect location to visit Rabat,This is a friendly and tastefully decorated hotel (modern decor) in a great location to visit Rabat. You can walk to most places and there are many cafes nearby. The rooms are quite large and comfortable with very comfortable beds and pillows. The lounge is friendly and has music on weekends and the breakfast buffet is very good. Staff is friendly and helpful. The best aspect of the hotel is it's location since it is an easy walk to the heart of Rabat. I will definitely stay again because of the location and clean and comfortable rooms.
 February 2017,4,Decent hotel down town Rabat,"The hotel was a little worn but ok. There is a nice bar and some areas to sit. The rooms and beds are standard and about what you would expect at this level of hotel. The breakfast was a bit repetitive and the service at breakfast is a bit haphazard. I often had to find salt and pepper on other tables. There was no milk for the cereal and you had to hunt around to find serving spoons and this was repeated pretty much every morning. But breakfast aside, the staff was polite and I slept well."
 October 2016,4,Nicely Located Business Hotel,"The hotel was in a great location - conveniently located in city center Rabat. Before coming to Le Diwan I spent two nights at Mercure Rabat Sheherazade, Le Diwan was big rescue and far better. Room was comfortable and clean.Breakfast was decent. Taxis are available just outside hotel. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful. Restaurant was good, but with limited options. Veg food is difficult to find in entire Rabat and so was the case in Le Diwan as well. Overall comfortable stay. May like to visit again in future."
 February 2017,1,Worst service and atmosphere,"Staff were unfriendly, breakfast below average. Location was convenient but on a busy road so cars noise was a nuisance. The hotel tried to rip us off at every possible junction, checked the minibar while we were still in the room. Not recommended"
 January 2017,4,enjoyed our stay,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nighs which included an extra night because we really like the hotel and how they valued our business.The hotel is anout 15 min walk from Rabt ville train station or 10 Dirh√†m taxi ride. The check in staff Maryem was lovely and she gave us a lovely room on High floor with view of Hassan Ii Tower.The room was small but comfortable .Everything was clean.Housekeeping did a great job everyday tidying and stocking our room .We were really impressed how they fold the bathrobe each day as if they were new robes.We also appreciated the welcome drink and macaroons in our room.Lobby, bar, breaskfast room and restaurant were all nice ,clean and comfortable.Staff in all these areas were lovely and helpful.Check out young man was also wonderful . He and the‚Ä¶"
 November 2016,3,"Reasonable stay, friendly staff, regular breakfast","It seems it is one of the top Hotels in town. For a 5 star hotel it's a bit outdated and worn out. However I had a pleasant enough stay and the staff was friendly. Their main restaurant was very good: the quality of the food and the service was really nice, and the prices very reasonable. The breakfast lacked a bit of variety."
 September 2016,5,Beautiful Hotel in Rabat,"Le Diwan offered a wonderful room, good restaurant and great local bar all a short distance from the Medina and the ocean. It is a great base to work out of, whether you are there on business or as a tourist. Great staff and it is about 20 minutes from the airport. Well worth the price."
 June 2016,4,Nice Hotel,"We loved out visit in Rabat. This hotel is clean, comfortable and has a great location. The staff were fantastic. The walk to some key places in Rabat was very nice. Taxis are always nearby if you need one. It was quiet and cute."
 November 2016,3,Le Diwan Rabat Morocco,"Decent hotel, place and rooms. It could be a bit noisy at night time, try to get the room on back side, there is not much to see out side the room window over the cirty. But it is quite. This hotel is close to lot of convienant , like restaurants, banks and local buses if you need them . Not a whole lot of sight seeing close this hotel, but the tram/street is close by to go places. Hotel staff is helpful and friendly."
 December 2016,4,Nice hotel.... some amenities missing,"The hotel,was in a great location - conveniently located to the Contemporary Art Museum, transportation, Mohammed V boulevard and more. The room was ok. The shower did not drain. The breakfast was quite adequate."
 December 2016,5,Loved our visit,"Great location to walk to cafes & the museum of modern art. We loved our stay here. The beds are very comfortable. The bathroom is convenient with all the amenities we like including a great shower, convenient counter space, and soft plush towels. Our favorite amenity in our room is a hot pot to make coffee/tea in our room. Breakfast was wonderful - best so far on this trip."
 June 2016,4,Enjoyed our stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights earlier this year while attending a festival in the city. Staff were incredibly helpful, the hotel was very secure and clean. My room was quite small, but clean and modern. The food on offer to vegetarians was limited, basically non existent. Breakfast was good, the only major issue which needs to be addressed is that the coffee was diabolical. Without a doubt the worst coffee I've ever had, which is a big big deal! Sort the coffee out, and I'll happily return ;)"
 November 2016,4,Very hellpful staff,"From helping me connect my wifi to finding me a guide who can take me to all the hidden places of Rabat this hotel is on the top of my list. Yes, the bed is nice, the rooms are very nice and their location is excrellent. Their service, however, is the best."
 December 2016,4,Morocco tour with my sister,This hotel has a fabulous breakfeast. It was way more than expected. Customer service was above expectation. Need a converter for electricity an they provided one free of charge. The rooms were very comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
 December 2016,4,"Friendly staff, comfy room",Only stayed for 1 night but found the hotel to be very good. Clean and tidy with very friendly staff. Did not eat in the hotel but the restaurant food looked good although there could have been more choice at breakfast buffet The rooms were very comfortable and clean and very well presented.
 October 2016,3,"All was adequate, but expected more","We stayed here one night as part of a group. The room was very average. It had a hair dryer, toiletries, a free bottle of water, coffee packets but it was missing the kettle. Our group dinner took 1.5 hours to come. That is ridiculous as they were expecting us. The plates/bowls used were old and often cracked. This is unfortunate because the food was delicious. The breakfast staff was overwhelmed by 3 travel groups eating at the same time. So many supplies were unavailable. They ran out of scrambled eggs, coffee cups, cutlery, etc. A ridiculous situation that they could have avoided. Again, unfortunate, because the food was very tasty."
 January 2016,5,Le Diwan Mgallery More than a hotle.,"It is a beautiful hotel located in the heart of Rabat. This is a very contemporary hotel with Wi-Fi, business center, confortable beds and showers. There is also a safe inside the room. My personal practice is to leave my passport in the hotel and walk the streets with a copy in my pocket. I never walked alone and always found others that would like to walk. This is a good way to make friends among fellow travelers. Very convenient, the hotel is located near Rabat Archeological Museum, the Tour Hassan, the Mausoleum of Mohamed V. and the Kasabah of the Udayas. You can walk up to two miles in all direction. I felt safe and there is police everywhere. Traffic is controlled by lights and just followed the people when crossing heavy traffic streets. The Hotel has two restaurants.‚Ä¶"
 November 2016,3,Central,Good for business travel. Friendly staff. Has the basics for a stay not a fancy one. Average room condition and appearane Nothing fancy. Breakfast was ok but limited options. Omelette is availble on demand but only egg and cheese :)
 November 2016,4,Lovely Hotel in Rabat,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights ... three of which were with our tour group. Check-in and reception were excellent. The rooms were very nicely furnished and had small refrigerators in them. My room got a little warm even though the temperature was turned off. I had to open my window to cool the room down. This worked fine for me as I was not on the street side, and it was very quiet. Breakfast was included with our room, and it was a very nice large buffet. The coffee was excellent. Service for the room was superior ... I never saw the housekeeping staff. There are safes in the room. There were not a lot of electrical outlets, and I use a CPAP, so it took a little creativity to get that plugged in and working."
 November 2016,2,Should have been better,"We stayed here our first night in Morocco. I had read previous reviews of this hotel so I knew what to check right off the bat and I can conquer with most of the statements. The safe in the room did not work, the room was not very clean. To my horror, when I walked in the room it looked like the maid left in a hurry because the bed was not completely made. There was a pillow laying in the middle of the bed with the pillow case half off. Upon closer inspection I was horrified to see that the pillow case had blood on it, not an old stain but fresh blood!! GROSS. There were only 2 towels in the bathroom. A little while later we hear a knock on the door and without waiting for us to answer, the maid unlocks the door and walks right in with towels etc. The breakfast was good‚Ä¶"
 November 2016,4,Clean and Relatively Quiet,"The room was very nice. Spotless clean. Nice bathroom. I was surprised to find a hair dryer. I'd been led to believe most hotels didn't have them. We even had a little sliver of balcony, which was fun when a drumming group started to play out on the street. The location was fine. Within easy walking distance to the medina. My only complaint is that the lobby is very heavily fragranced. Uncomfortable for any like myself with fragrance sensitivity."
 October 2016,4,Clean and convenient,"We stayed here our first night in Morocco so I wasn't sure what the hotel situation would be like. We were happy with the choice in Rabat- it is in a very convenient area, you can walk around the city and feel safe. The room was clean, the air conditioner worked well and there was free Wi-Fi. The beds were twin beds that were pushed together and they were very comfortable. We had no problems sleeping! The breakfast was a buffet and had plenty of choices. The restaurant was very nice if you don't feel like going out to eat dinner."
 October 2016,4,Nice place,"We stayed here in October as part of a tour group. The hotel was modern, very clean, plenty of room to move around & very comfortable beds. This was our first night in Morocco and it was a delight to stay here & experience good hospitality. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we had on our tour, with plenty of fresh fruit, pastries and hot options available. The hotel had a bar with a good selection of local wines. The restaurant also provided great meals. All staff were friendly."
 October 2016,4,Comfortable,"Our room was fairly small but comfortable and furnished in quite a dark European style. We had a door that opened onto a terrace with a herb garden. The bathroom was good and well appointed, although no plug in the wash basin here or at any of the 6 hotels I stayed at in Morocco. The hotel is located on a large busy intersection surrounded by bland office buildings and the area lacks character. Unlike a lot of other comments from people who need their hot cooked eggs I enjoyed the breakfast buffet because it had a really good selection of fresh whole & sliced fruit. In the chiller cabinets at the back, next to the sliced cheeses & meats for Europeans, you could find sundaes of yoghurt & stewed fruit in Mason jars and also the most delicious spiced fruit salad/compote."
 November 2016,4,Excellent Hotel I give it 4.5 stars,"We stayed here in Rabat for our trip thru Morocco. The hotel is very nice. A small lobby but our room on the 6th floor had a view of the city. The room was very nice with a safe & small frig. A nice large bathroom. The air conditioning worked fine. The staff was very friendly & helpful. The only negative I have is the breakfast. They have a nice selection of foods, fruit, pastries, breads, & cheese. The scrambled eggs were sitting in a hot steam tray. They were not very good. No Omlette Bar or prepared eggs. It was hard to find a salt & pepper shaker. I would recommend this hotel it is well located within walking distance of most of the city attractions."
 October 2016,4,Comfort and Convenience,"This modern hotel is in a very good location within walking distance of the old city. It is located on a very busy street, but our room at the back was very quiet and had a tiny standing-room only balcony overlooking the city. The room was average in size and very clean. I liked the design, with dark wood trim and a long entrance hall that had ample closet space and a tray ceiling. All of the usual amenities were present: flat screen tv, hair dryer, refrigerator, etc. The air conditioning worked well. We had two twin beds that were pushed together and were very comfortable. The staff were very pleasant. The marble bathroom was very clean, but the deep tub/shower combo was very slippery. I would have appreciated a washcloth, which I didn't see anywhere in Morocco, so‚Ä¶"
 September 2016,3,OK But Nothing To Write Home About,"This hotel is fine for a few nights stay but certainly nothing special. The rooms are fairly small and the furnishings are a bit tired. Additionally, our carpet was dirty and the air conditioning did not function properly. However, the location is good, the bath was well appointed and the breakfast was adequate. So if this venue fits your price range and there are no other viable options, you could give it a go."
 October 2016,5,Excellent staff,"I was very pleased of the staff working at the hotel. Very pleasant, informative - made me feel so welcomed. Food was just amazing! Chief of staff was really taking care of all my daily needs as a guest. She was extremely helpful. Thank you for being so welcoming."
 October 2016,4,A nice hotel in great location,"This hotel had everything we needed, was clean and had a helpful staff. It's an older hotel and was not luxurious, but still a comfortable place to stay. The breakfast, which is included, is average. However, the restaurant attached to the hotel served great dinners for reasonable prices. The location was excellent as you could walk to most major nearby attractions."
 October 2016,4,Good business hotel,"A fair enough location, a comfortable-enough room, a breakfast that was pretty good. There's nothing to dislike about this hotel. What was good was the photographic exhibit on the second floor. The breakfast coffee service was spotty (especially when the staff was busy and hapless customers tried to serve themselves, dumping the coffee onto the floor). This happened several times while we stayed here. Either fix the coffee carafes, or hire a dedicated coffee pourer?"
 October 2016,4,comfortable hotel in a good location!,"Friends and I did a Gate 1 tour of Morocco [7 days] and our first stop was Rabat. The location is excellent despite the fact that the hotel may be a little dated. The room was nice, tastefully decorated. There were a limited number of electrical outlets, however. [charging is a problem] In the room that I had, the safe was in the TV console, whereas my friend's was located in the closet. Wi Fi is available but slow. The tub in this particular room was slanted forward and slippery with no mat to stop one from falling forward. There was also no bar to hold onto if you did feel yourself falling-I felt this may be a problem for an elderly or disabled patron. The water pressure in the shower was adequate. Coffee and tea were provided in the room and of course, laundry service was‚Ä¶"
 October 2016,4,Comfortable and central.,A Sofitel/Accor hotel so the standard is typical of their world wide reputation. Windows are double glazed so the room was very quiet. Very comfortable bed and bathroom. Wifi and cable tv in rooms. The buffet breakfast was excellent. Has a bar and an up market restaurant as well. It is on the cities two ultra modern tram routes so accessing the train station or the medina is very easy.
 October 2016,4,"Good air conditioning, no hot water in my shower","I stayed in a single room here while traveling with an Overseas Adventure Travel group. This business hotel is well-located just a few minutes' walk from Mohammed V Avenue and the train station (but you're arriving by train with luggage, you'll probably want to take a Petit Taxi here.) Unlike some hard-mattressed Moroccan beds, this one is comfortable, with plenty of pillows. There's a safe in the closet, a TV that works well, and plenty of shelves and drawers. The bathroom is big enough, but I could never get hot water in my shower. This place has no atmosphere, but it works well. Breakfast requires flexibility: they might not have bananas, say, by the time you get down, and you have to ask the right person if you want an omelet. But coffee service is good, and there's a‚Ä¶"
 September 2016,3,We had a good stay at this hotel. This hotel is a bit dated but its located right in the middle of Rabat.,"My family and I stayed at this hotel for two days, its a old hotel our rooms were good but the elevator was a bit scary the restaurant in the hotel is good for food, service and quality. Hotel staff members were very helpful."
 September 2016,4,"Comfortable, friendly and central","Good business class hotel, central to Rabat and its main areas. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The in house restaurant serves very good food and there is a small bar area with occasional live music. The city tramway system has a stop near the hotel and all main tourism areas are within reasonable walking distance. The hotel rooms have good air conditioning and sound proofing, essential for the hot climate and busy exterior city centre traffic."
 September 2016,4,Great hotel,"Great hotel, centrally located. My room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. The staff was very nice and helpful. The food in the buffet was good. There is an onsite restaurant, but I didn't try it."
 September 2016,4,Elegant hotel in Rabat,"The Dirwan was probably once a top flight hotel. Time has caught it up a little, but it remains a very comfortable, cosy hotel, full of charm and grace. The staff are excellent - very helpful and keen to ensure you enjoy your stay. We stayed for just 2 nights. The hotel is well located for a short sightseeing trip. It is only 10 minutes walk down to the Medina and about the same to the new town area. Both are very much worth the visit. Our room was quite spacious, as was the bathroom. All areas were very clean. The bed was very comfortable. There is no road or other noise in the room. WiFi is provided and worked well. There are multiple restaurants within walking distance - we would recommend the sunken square which is beside the flower market. Only 3 minutes walk‚Ä¶"
 September 2016,5,Best burger in Morocco!,I was recently in Rabat for some business and a friend recommended having lunch at Le Diwan. They had a nice lunch menu at the bar and I decided on the cheese burger. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely go back next time I am in Rabat.
 September 2016,5,Good,"First ,i want to thanks everybody for their kindness and This is the nicest hotel i have stayed in To start with the room was so comfortable in addition the staff were helpful,courteous and efficient .the food was good and delicious I will turn back soon ,thanks a lot for everything ."
 September 2016,3,Not at soffitel standard,"Room is just Ok, at one time hotel was probably very nice. This is now barely a 3 star. Room seems clean, but smells moldy. Amenities are OK, staff are OK, not overly friendly or helpful. Phone did not work. Not sure this is the place to stay in RAbat."
 August 2016,5,Great service,"The whole staff at this hotel is helpful. I stayed here for nearly 2 weeks, everyone from Saleh the manager to the amazing servers throughout the hotel were extremely accommodating & friendly. I highly recommend Le Diwan for anyone visiting Rabat- looking for a clean environment, and a dedicated staff. Great hotel!"
 July 2016,4,Very nice Hotel in the hearth of town,"Very nice service, rooms amazing!, close to everything and a few steps from the tram that take you everywhere on town. I will really commend this hotel. Breakfast is really nice and staff very professional and nice."
 August 2016,5,Comfortable hotel and friendly staff,The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly with us. We really felt welcomed and I thank everyone for their exemplary hospitality. The room was fine with a large comfortable bed. The lobby is nice and the reception staff is the greatest.
 May 2016,4,Nice enough hotel with some glitches,"Stayed here on a recent (May 2016) trip to Rabat. The hotel has some pluses -- the hammam and the breakfast room/buffet -- but some kinks to work out -- dark hallways and outdated rooms and the noisiest generator/ac unit on the planet, which my room was rather near. Staff was mostly helpful although not everyone spoke English -- French is the better bet in most places in Rabat."
 May 2016,4,Comfortable and friendly in the center of it all,"Le Diwan Hotel in Rabat was in the center of the City making it easy walking distance to many interesting sites. It is comfortable and has very friendly, helpful staff. The bar and restaurant offered good choices at reasonable prices."
 June 2016,5,great stay,"I've traveled extensively in Morocco, and this is the nicest hotel I've stayed in. It's very up-to-date, the bed was comfortable and the hotel was quiet. The lobby is very nice and the staff were helpful and courteous. Wish I could have stayed longer."
 April 2016,4,Modern,"Standard hotel room. Comfortable, clean and quiet. Breakfast buffet was good. Service was very good. A ten minute walk to the Medina. The art museum and archeological museum are within a ten minute walk also. Chellah is a 30 minute walk or a 7 minute taxi ride."
 June 2016,5,Will be back!!,My second stay at this comfortable and welcoming hotel conveniently situated in the centre of Rabat. The staff are efficient and bend over backwards to help. I can recommend this as a perfect place for a stay in Morocco's capital.
 April 2016,4,Well Located Hotel,We chose this hotel for its location and guest reviews. And we felt happy that we had chosen Le Dewan. Its very centrally located - in fact just a few minutes walk from the railway station and the central area. Check in was fast and friendly. Rooms are of varying sizes. They are comfortable and have all amenities that one is looking for. Breakfast was very delicious. In room dining was also good. One could also order from various fast food restaurants in the vicinity. Various sites and the old Medina is also not too far. There is a tram station not too far from the hotel.
 May 2016,2,Extremely noise rooms to street side - Not a 4*,First night room in 1st floor to street side - direct above traffic light at crossing. Extremely noisy - even in the night. 2nd night room war to the rear 8th floor - better but still not calm. Hotel claims to be 4star but is 3*. Rooms need to be renovated.
 May 2016,2,Average business hotel pretending to be a luxury hotel,"This is a mediocre business/tour group hotel with luxury hotel prices. The rooms are average and it has a good (pricey) restaurant. Though everyone was very nice, service was very poor. I had requested a non-smoking room but was put in a very stinky smoking room. The hallway reeked of smoke. I called reception and was told they were full but would move me the next day. That night I was really affected by the air in the room and called reception at 9 a.m. The receptionist seemed not to be aware of the plan. I asked her to move me soon because my lungs were really congested (she said she could hear that in my voice) and also because I wanted to get out and see the city. After an hour and a half and 3 phone calls, I went down to reception which was not at all busy. I was‚Ä¶"
 May 2016,5,"Great Food, Location and Food","Great friendly Staff, close proximity to city center. Clean rooms and very good food. On arrival late with my group of 11 colleagues we had a great meal prepared on short notice. That did it for me. I will definitely be staying there again."
 May 2016,5,"Beautiful Hotel, delicious food and great location!","In the heart of the city center, this hotel is a minute walk from most of the historical monuments and attractions. My room was great! Clean, spacious with big windows which allowed lots of light to come in. The staff are all so sweet and very helpful. My favorite part though was the food! From the presentation of every dish you could tell that the chef really cares. Awesome combinations of flavours! I will definitely stay here again!"
 March 2016,5,Very nice clean hotel.,This very modern hotel was centrally situated within walking distance of everything you might need. Very close to a little shopping area that also had restaurants. The staff was very helpful. Added bonus were shoe shine machines on every floor :-)
 May 2016,4,Good location,"This is a good hotel, close to city center. All amenities you would expect from a good hotel. Walking distance to shops, restaurants and museum. The medina (old town with market) is 15-20 minutes away."
 March 2016,3,Good hotel but had communication problem with receptionists,"Gate 1 booked Le Diwan Rabat Hotel as part of their tour package. It is a big hotel and my room was standard and clean. There was a big selection for a buffet breakfast. Aside from the food that was displaced on the counters, there are things in the refrigerator for guests as well ‚Äì yogurt, fruits etc. The eating area was big, clean, and comfortable. The hotel is centrally located. There are many restaurants in the neighborhood if you do not want to eat in the hotel. It is about 5 minutes walk to the Modern Art & Contemporary Art Museum, the Archeological Museum, and a light rail station. It is a short distance walk to the Rabat Ville Train Station and the medina. The medina was a fun place to visit ‚Äì just like an old market with clothes, toys, household goods, and food.‚Ä¶"
 May 2016,5,"Gorgeous property, fabulous city center location","My husband and I stayed at Le Diwan in a suite (room 515) and our expectations were exceeded. The room was spacious and had a living area, a dining area and two bathrooms! The appointments were very nice, too. The staff at Le Diwan are top-notch. They provide excellent and sincere customer service. The restaurant is not to be missed-we had a lovely lunch and enjoyed a Moroccan ""grey"" wine - incredible and one of our best meals. The concierge and his team are also great - whatever you need, they are there for you. We opted for the the wifi / breakfast package and were glad we did. The wifi was fast and the b-fast was nice (but not nearly as nice as the hotel restaurant)I was overwhelmed by the level of service, the hotel and the location. I will stay here again!"
 March 2016,4,Nice hotel but problems with maintenance,"The hotel gives an impression of quality and design, so you really feel that this is a not-so-big, prime place to stay. This feeling is accentuated by the very nice staff, always ready to help and smiling. However, once you are in, you start noticing the inconsistencies between the quality you would expect and the small but many problems you find in the room, such as a rusty shower or a leaking tap. Because these small but irritating things are so evidently in contrast with all the rest, I can say that a low maintenance budget and/or the little attention paid to this is the most serious problem in this hotel. Another serious problem, at least in the room I was in, was the noise you hear coming from other rooms. I am not a light sleeper, but the noise coming from another room‚Ä¶"
 April 2016,4,Nice Hotel in good location,This small hotel is a nice hotel in a fairly good location not far from a tramway station. Rooms are cozy although not very big. The staff is very friendly and helpful and we found the breakfast buffet very good.the rooms are well stuffed and the bed comfortable.
 April 2016,5,"Central, clean and helpful","I recently stayed at Le Diwan whilst touring Morocco. I found the hotel to be clean, centrally located (a 15 minute walk to the Medina) and the staff to be particularly helpful. Ibtissam greeted us on arrival, her English was excellent and she was very professional."
 April 2016,5,Sejour,I was really pleased to have an experience of a lifetime.... Everything rocks....I enjoyed staying in here...Simply one hell of a hotel...One night is like staying at paradise...The food is quite amazing.... Thanks to those brilliant chefs...& those managers who provide you...with everything you may ask for... Cheer Up...
 March 2016,4,"Pay More to Get More, Up Market Rooms Excellent","My wife and I lodged here last 2 nights of our week in Maroc. Rented a suite for modestly more than a room. That's where their quality resides. Ordinary rooms may be like Best Western motels. But, up market rooms are exceptional, so splurge and enjoy. Central location is worth it. Be sure to eat at Cosmopolitan and Al Marsa (on the river). Staff are friendly, helpful and mostly unsophisticated so they're somewhat slow in an effort to get things right and keep you happy. Be patient. Surprisingly good mojitos and margaritas at bar and a cool musician doing live music (reminds one of the piano player in the movie, Casablanca)."
 March 2016,3,"Decent hotel, great location but breakfast buffet has problems.",This hotel is used by Gate 1 Travel for their tours and we stayed here at the start of our Morocco tour. The hotel is decent in a great location of the city near a light rail line. Easy walk to museums and their medina (markets). The room are OK but their breakfast buffet has something to be desired. They serve horrible scrambled eggs in a chaffing dish that taste horrible likely made from a dry egg mix. The other items are fine especially the individual jars of cut up fruit next to the yogurt.
 March 2016,1,"Good location, but had bad experience","After reading reviews on trip advisor, I expected a comfortable stay here as part of Gate 1 travel. Although the room looked superficially nice, we found the floors to be dirty; the bed had wrinkled sheet and comforter. I removed all the sheets, so the housekeeping could put new sheets. The faucet was leaking which took more than a day to fix. The towels were not replenished the second day. I had to go down the receptionist and demand immediate service. Although the location is good to royal palace, minaret, museums, tram, and restaurants, I would not stay here because of our bad experience. Could not believe this was a 4 star hotel!"
 March 2016,4,Almost Great!,This was the first stop on a Gate 1 tour for two nights. Hotel was very good. Modern and clean rooms. Everything is very good except for the breakfast. The selection was limited and they ran out of food. Our guests were standing around waiting for food to be re-filled.
 March 2016,4,Comfortable hotel,"We stayed here two nights during the first leg of a six city tour of Morocco. This is a comfortable hotel with reliable wifi, a lounge with bar and live music, and a very nice restaurant, La Brasserie, available for lunch and dinner. The room itself is spacious, the linens are clean, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom has modern fixtures and amenities. Centrally located in the middle of the city, the street noise can be heard inside room 203 (However, living in Washington, DC, it didn't bother us at all). If you have issues with street noise, a room on a higher floor may help. The service provided by the hotel staff is also satisfactory. We had a problem with our TV remote control; after calling the front desk, someone from maintenance was dispatched in a timely manner‚Ä¶"
 March 2016,4,End of our tour in Morocco,"Good location with tram close by and the souk about a 20 minutes walk. Lots of restaurant choices nearby. The hotel has a luxury feel to it, but it does serve large tour groups. Breakfast can be chaotic with staff seemingly over whelmed. Choice is limited as well, definitely toward the bottom half of the breakfasts we had at the hotels on this trip."
 March 2016,4,Start of our tour of Morocco,"This was our first stop on a two week tour and the staff have been great, the room all that we needed along with a wonderful breakfast. Can't wait to see more of the country and city. If you have a chance to stay in Rabat give them a try you won't be disappointed."
 January 2016,5,Sizable room that was both clean and comfortable,"Excellent hotel with larger business style room with ample space to move around. Room also had a queen size comfortable bed, strong shower with plenty of hot water, and a small balcony. Hotel is very convenient (one block away) to a market square that had a delightful food bazaar. Hotel has a bar that serves alcohol... but does not serve draft beer."
 February 2016,3,Perfectly adequate hotel for the price,Clean functional hotel. Pleasant staff who will try their best to help you although not always the most efficient service. Well situated with a bar and a restaurant. All rooms have bathrooms and not just showers although some are quite small.
 January 2016,4,Very Nice Hotel,"Hotel was walking distance to the medina and Mohammed V Avenue. Good for tourists to walk to these places. Hotel was very nice and the staff was extremely helpful. One draw back was that the AC in the room was not working. We only stayed there for two nights. I simply opened the window and cooled the room that way. Also, the bedit and the toilet was too close. Only about 6 inches facing each other. The room was very comfortable but it can use a makeover. We paid about $170 CAD a night which I found a little pricey for the quality of the room."
 January 2016,5,Service excellent and comfortable rooms,"Walking distance to resturants and very close to public transportation. It was a little chilly on our first night, and the staff brought us a room heater that was perfect. Rooms were clean and beds very comfortable. The buffet breckfast was just ok. Not a lots of choices, but ok."
 February 2016,4,Perfect City Centre Hotel,"6 story modern well appointed and well located hotel. Excellent rooms and bathrooms, the ubiquitous 'international' restaurant and a small comfortable bar, serving light meals from a small menu and featuring live music. Buffet breakfast disappointing hence a ""very good"" rather than an ""excellent"" overall rating"
 February 2016,3,"Excellent location, good-ish hotel in need of some works","The hotel enjoys of a very strategic position, close to everything there is to see or to do in Rabat. Efficient personnel at the reception make the registration easy and swift. Unfortunately my room was on the sure and the noise isolation was not super. Also, the moquette was pretty old and stinky, which is always e big no for me. Room's furniture were old and in need of a refurbishment, the bathroom was correct and clean. Another big no are the smokers: in the hotel is allowed to smoke in some common areas, this should be forbidden. The elevators' buttons were not working properly and one has to repeatedly press them to make the elevator move, but sometimes it doesn't work any way. Good breakfast with local specialities. A lot the restaurant (the Brasserie) is ok, with a very‚Ä¶"
 February 2016,5,"Le Diwan, An excellent hotel: Food and service","Located in the heart of Rabat Center, this nice and cosy hotel is excellent for a business trip as well as a touristic once. Service is awesome and the staff are very welcoming. Rooms are perfect, la brasserie is a gorgeous stylish restaurant, food is excellent, the menu is made by one of the nicest French Chefs. This hotel is close to everything in Rabat, I loved my stay there and wish them all the best. Special thanks goes to AS."
 February 2016,5,"Central location, nice hotel","Le Diwan is centrally located, walking distance to most of Rabat's tourist and business attractions. It's clean, neat, and the service is great. I was very impressed by the restaurant - the food is just amazing and the price is good. After reading reviews about their breakfast somehow lacking, I expected the worst, but was very pleasantly surprised. The first room I stayed in did have a strange smell, but as soon as I mentioned it to the reception, they sent someone to check it out and then I changed rooms with no issues. My room was nice, clean, and the internet worked well. I will stay there again if I go back to Rabat."
 January 2016,5,Friendly staff and really great bed linens !,"We had a great 1 night stay at this hotel. They gave us a great deal + room upgrade. The bed linen is AWESOME ! OMG, I loved it , so soft ! The room is very confortable, small terrace which is rare, bathroom was very cleaned and bathtub and shower very good, very hot water! We booked at last minute coming from Marrakech. Breakfast was also very complete (fruits, breads, scramble eggs, yogurt, I remember they had many hot food options, 2 types of soups, anyways it was very diverse)... We will definitely come back here."
 January 2016,4,Centrally located welcoming hotel in Rabat,"This hotel is great for a visit to Rabat whether for business or pleasure. Its central location is close to great shopping, restaurants and tourist attractions. The staff was very welcoming and made us feel valued. The service staff are very professional, courteous, and friendly. Most staff I interacted with spoke English (official languages are Arabic, French and Amazigh). The restaurant on the ground floor serves great food, staff are very friendly, professional and fluent in English. I would recommend the lamb and a local Moroccan red wine, Terres Rouges. The room was clean and well kept."
 January 2016,5,Very good hotel to stay with an excellent restaurant,"Very good , very clean hotel with a very good service , very close to downtown and with a very good restaurant ""La Brasserie"". It is very good value for money . Only breakfast could be better. but for the rest an excellent hotel to stay."
 March 2015,2,It is a short stay hotel,Due to the crowded location of the hotel and very limited facilities it is fine to stay there while on business quick trip as there is nothing special on site no swimming pool no activities staff number is very limited and in general it is a bit noisy hotel as it is in the busiest area in rabat. In rabat you still can find better for the same price.
 December 2015,1,Horrible,"It smells so bad, from the lobby to the elevator to your pillow. It stinks! Also, the carpets are stained and the hotel in general is not clean. It is very old and un-renovated. I did not enjoy my stay here at all. I am never ever coming back. I would not recommend this hotel. It has a four star rating but in reality I would give it one star. The breakfast food is not so good either. And they will yell at you if you are in a hurry and try to take your breakfast sandwich to go."
 November 2015,5,best in town,"this hotel is ideally located in the VERY center of town , close to everything .. the staff is always going the extra mile to make the guests happy , you can feel that they care .. rooms have erything one might need . book it !"
 October 2015,4,Nice hotel close to sightseeings,"Chose this hotel as I'm fond of MGallery network. I'd rather say this one is quite simple taking into account that MGallery hotels are usually located in historic buildings. the hotel is close to Chellah and Medina, 2 quartiers from Rabat Ville station and Mohammed V museum. Rooms are nice, bed are soft, bathroom is clean, nice scent in air ventilation system. Appreciated room upgrade, impression of personnel is mixed: someone is very attentive in line with rules, still I wasn't asked if I need a taxi when collected my belongings at 4pm at departure. Most of guests prefer to avoid breakfast as it is quite expensive (for Morocco) as well the choice is adequate but quite limited: 4 star hotel should offer more fresh fruits and cheese/cold cuts shouldn't be covered with food wrap‚Ä¶"
 November 2015,3,Good,"Good room, bad breakfast, high price, good location, good service, water only one day complimentary, their is coffee machine but no water, weak wifi, no view with rooms, helpful stuff, smell of hotel not nice when you come in, but they try their best to help you but you have to be on their head"
 October 2015,5,"Excellent rooms, quiet, good beds and free toiletries. Highly recommended!","The quiet rooms were wonderful, with good beds and excellent free toiletries. After a long day of travel, it was great to have everything provided. The location is good, as it is near the main historic sights of Rabat. I have no complaints at all and nothing but praise for this hotel!"
 November 2015,5,"Centrally located, great for exploring the city","We stayed here as part of a Moroccan tour, and although we didn't select the hotel, the accomodations are very nice. The staff is friendly and attentive. The breakfast was included with the room, and included French and Moroccan specialties. Rooms were non-smoking which was great!"
 November 2015,4,Brief but comfortable stay,"Stayed here for 1 night. Things to be mindful of; 1. Free wifi 2. There are only euro sockets. Bring your own converter for your US appliances 3. No iron in room. Quick stay here. Room was clean, tidy. Beds soft. We had twins. Room nice size. The staff friendly. The hotel restaurant had good food. Bottled water complimentary and in every room. Has spa services but I didn't try them. In great location. I would recommend."
 November 2015,5,Enjoying this gem,"Perfectly situated, modern hotel with all the amenities in the centre of Rabat close to the Museums of Contemporary Art, Archeology, and a 20 minute walk to the Medina. Staff courteous and helpful, most English speaking. Large, comfortable rooms."
 October 2015,5,Great place to stay,"Really nice modern facility. Centrally located, rooms with all the amenities you could want, very pleasant and helpful staff, great breakfast. Strong, fast wifi connection. Near shopping and restaurants. A great place to stay after a long, transAtlantic trip."
 October 2015,4,Comfortable 4 star stay,"Le Diwan Rabat Stayed here two nights as part of a Gate1 guided tour and loved this hotel. Modern and very comfortable room with all amenities, a definite 4 star hotel. Even an espresso machine. Breakfast was varied with many savory and sweet choices and the only confusing thing was guessing which pot held coffee and which held water or milk. Our room was facing the street so there was some street noise even on the top floor. The surroundings are safe and close to the flower market are a few lively cafes where you can eat Western and Moroccan type food. Tip: traffic will not stop even when crossing the street via a crosswalk."
 October 2015,4,Good hotel in center of the city,"We stayed here with a group tour. Hotel was clean and well located. Staff was professional and friendly. Bar was a little smoky but pleasant, with an excellent singer one evening. The restaurant was excellent for dinner with many French specialties and good wine. Good wifi."
 November 2015,5,Hotel,"""Nice hotel""this is my second time here in the capital of morrocco.well located hotel.room was large and clean with free wifi.staff are so freindly specially at breakfast.i will come back. Tres belle chambre spacieuse propore. Equipe au top a latention de chaque client"
 October 2015,1,Terrible place to stay,"#1 Its almost like CIA agency, they do not tell you the rules upfront and someone is always walking on you back eveywhere. #2 Internet (wifi) is terrible, it is not working at all and even you are so lucky that it works the speed is like Dial-up #3 You ask for room change or any issue to solve, you will never be updated on that and of course your issue will not be solved. #4 In the Spa center no-one speaks English and every worker is lazy to do their staff properly ! Only good service providers are door servants that are really nice and willing to help you, with anything they can do !"
 October 2015,2,Disappointed,"From reading prior reviews, expected a nicer hotel & was disappointed. Floor looked like it hadn't been vacuumed, bathroom less than clean and room rather small. Best feature was their French restaurant which served excellent, reasonably priced food. Restaurant gets 4*, hotel 1-2*, but conveniently located."
 October 2015,5,At the heart of it all,This very clean hotel is centrally located to sites around the city. We felt very safe walking around the area and found a lovely restaurant just a few blocks away. The King was visiting the day we were there so the streets were lined with locals and tourists.
 October 2015,5,Most friendly and courteous staff,All staff are so friendly but courteous and very professional; this is very rare. Service is fast and with warmth and quality. I can only be very positive about cleanliness. Free wifi that works very well; no need to pay more to get better quality wifi connection. The hotel is also conveniently located Well done!
 October 2015,4,"A well run, clean hotel",We stayed here with a group tour. Room was very clean and well maintained. Wifi was excellent! Well located hotel.... Would stay here again. My only caveat is the a/c which is on the warm side. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was adequate and room was clean and cheerful every morning.
 October 2015,4,Not bad at all.,This is a very nice hotel .location will be 10. Rooms 10. Room cleanliness 10+++. House keeping is the best I ever seen. The only reason for a 4 stars and not 5 is the room service. They have to work on a little improvement. Room service manger is a wonderful lady and I believe she is working on building a better team. Overall. It is a pretty experience in an amazing country.
 October 2015,4,Friendly quiet clean and modern,"Staying here now, checking out tomorrow, so far so good! Close by are banks, tram stops, money changing stands, a brief walk to a fabulous contemporary art museum, saw that earlier ($20 dirhams pp, open till 6 pm) housekeeping are thorough respectful and kind"
 October 2015,5,excellent place to stay,staff welcoming and efficient ; room and bed very comfortable ; very nice decoration everywhere ; excellent bar and restaurant ; very near the tramway and city center ; I was on the 6th floor : nice view on the city Fran√ßoise B.
 October 2015,5,Wonderful place to stay,"I am currently here for just one night, but wish I could stay longer. The staff was welcoming and efficient. The room is comfortable and sparkling clean (especially the bathroom). There are numerous bathroom amenities. The wi-fi connection is good. I haven't tried the restaurant yet so can't comment on that, but everything else is super."
 October 2015,4,A good overall hotel.,Everything was fine. A good utilitarian hotel. Comfortable. Internet worked well. Bathtub was comfortable. Beds were good. The carpet was getting a little worn and could use a cleaning. ...........................................................................................................
 October 2015,3,Not great but not bad,"We stayed here on a group trip. The service was okay, we asked for extra towels but never received any. The chef was nice to make special dinners for us, which were fairly good. Our room had a bit of a musty smell and our bathroom light stopped working on the 2nd day (but we didn't report either of these since we were only here 2 nights)."
 September 2015,5,"Service great, room great, location great!","We stayed here two nights during an OAT tour of Morocco. It was a great experience. The room was very nicely appointed, the wifi was free, and the staff were super friendly and helpful (gave good directions to banks and the tram). I would definitely stay here again...and again."
 September 2015,3,Good place to Stay,"Stayed there for 2 nights while on a business trip to Rabat. After 14 hours getting there, the room that was not what I had requested. Add to that, the phone in the room was broken... had to carry all my stuff back down to complain, and was given a relatively a better room. I had stayed at another MGallery Hotel recently, so frankly speaking my expectation was very high. Otherwise, Le Diwan is an ok hotel. Breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about... Location is central, its also 10 minutes walk from the old souk. All in all, it was an average experience for me."
 September 2015,4,Pretty Good,"The hotel was pretty nice overall. It was clean and in a decent area. There is a nice square with a lot of restaurant choices about a block away. Good location the grab a cab easily. The elevators need help. The doors are very serious about closing and the elevators are extremely small. There is an attached restaurant but when we tried to eat there, no one was there to seat us...we waited awhile and tried to call to the staff who was laughing and talking in the kitchen. We ended up getting room service instead. The food was pretty good.there is a cafe type room in the 2nd floor and is where breakfast was served. HELPFUL TIP: You have to put your key card in the slot right inside the door in order to get any lights."
 September 2015,4,nice place,"We enjoyed staying here. Clean, reasonable bar, mostly decent continental breakfast. Within easy walking distance of many restaurants, museums, and local shops. Right next to bank with atm and tram. A little scary trying to cross the street, lots of traffic."
 September 2015,5,A place to do business and pleasure,"I m a frequent traveler and this place is just a good combination between a good place to sleep and make business appointment, and a good place to have a break at the bar, the food at the Brasserie restaurant is tasty and fresh, and special thanks to the team, great service through all the stay."
 September 2015,3,A good place that would benefit a re-boot,"A great night's sleep in comfortable, clean rooms with good walking in any direction to the old city or to the old downtown. Friendly staff who meet the standard. When it opened about 15 years ago, it was a good addition to the mix and was a strong four star property. As happens, it is now has more competition and the city center has moved. The property footprint was always a little problematic and the reception/lobby/bar is squeezed in and the squeezing is reflected also in two elevators that serve housekeeping needs, as well. Minor amenities (like replacing the coffee sachets daily) are overlooked though the nightly Moroccan cookie on the pillow was always delivered. The hallways are a little on the dark side for my taste. Others have remarked on the parking‚Ä¶"
 September 2015,5,"Excellent service, great location, I would stay again","Gate 1 uses this hotel, it's a little dated but we are really enjoying our stay.  We were warmly greeted & our check- in process was quick. This is day 2 of our 3 day stay. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, comfy, peaceful & restful. Breakfast was exquisite, & fresh with a large variety of dishes; figs, dates, raisins, crossaints, bread, soup, porridge, crepes, sauasage, meats, cheeses, etc. The staff is attentive to our needs & there is something for every palate.  Haha, I will tell you about the two harmless higglers who are nearby the hotel, patronize them & negotiate, haggle on the prices. I bought two beautiful Moroccan caftans (gifts), one orange, one blue. My friend bought a silver necklace & bracelet set.  Also nearby, a court with various restaurants, just lovely to‚Ä¶"
 August 2015,3,Significantly over priced hotel with no value,The hotel is running on flight crew and business travellers. Although location is good but hotel itself is not very good. Breakfast is ok nothing special. Except for one gentlemen there is a communication problem with almost all the staff.
 June 2015,4,"Great staff ,clean place,convinient location , but .....","The Hotel has a beautiful reception and Grounds to match. Professional Front desk "" Young Receptionist"" both gentleman and lady are friendly and very helpful, doorman ,security and all of 'em were fantastic. Me and my wife drove to Rabat back the 29th June 2015, once we get to the hotel, I was struggling with parking area, when I found a spot beside the hotel, then suddenly an old man blocked my way asking for money in order to park my car after( which is illegal) ,after 20 minute of arguments and inappropriate insults finally the doorman find a spot but after it was very stressful to deal with that old man ( illegal parking gardien) well, after all, it wasn't the hotel's mistake, but hope if they can fix that parking issues. Rooms were awesome and clean....everything‚Ä¶"
 May 2015,4,Nice place / small hotel / staff could be better,"Nice location, nice hotel. Great potential but needs more effort from the staff. Lunch was very good even if a bit slow (we were at a conference and didn't have that much time). The lounge by breakfast room / conference was a cloud of smoke, really not a good idea. Rooms were nice even if showing a bit of wear. First night did not sleep because they gave a room next to service elevator which was running most of the night."
 March 2015,4,Great location near key Rabat attractions,"I stayed at the Le Diwan Rabat during a recent tour of Morocco. The room was comfortable and clean, though unexceptional. It was the kind of room that most people will find satisfactory. I did like the location of my room which gave me a commanding view of the Chellah Avenue traffic circle directly in front of the hotel. I could watch the locals coming and going, which I found to be fascinating as this was my first day ever in Africa. While this might put some people off because of potential automobile noise issues, this was not the case. I had heard that Rabat was a quiet city and that certainly proved to be true. There was very little traffic during the night and all was silent (except for a barking dog down the block). I got very little sleep while staying here, but it was‚Ä¶"
 May 2015,4,"Clean, comfortable and cozy",Good location. Everything works efficiently. Rooms are very comfortable. Very courteous and helpful housekeeping staff. Breakfast is average. Concierge service very good. Reception staff very friendly. Did not use bar.
 May 2015,4,Decent Hotel in heart of Rabat,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights as part of the Gate1 tour of Morocco. The hotel is located on a busy street and round-a-bout. If the windows are shut you did not hear much of the traffic outside. The hotel had courteous front-desk service, clean rooms, decent WiFi (not the best). On the 2nd floor, there is a funky art gallery by the breakfast area. The free breakfast was very good quality. They had Moroccan flavors (soups and other local items), typical fare like yogurt, breads, and eggs. It also had homemade donuts and pastries, charcuterie, and fruits. The breakfast service is very laid-back, which we found was very typical of Morocco. You have to ask for things as they do not bother you unless you ask. Rabat has a people-mover train that you can catch a block from the‚Ä¶"
 May 2015,5,beautiful hotel quite near the central station,"On walking distance, but a taxi would be more practical, from the Central Station you'll find Hotel Le Diwan. I would consider this hotel as 4 star. The rooms are not that big, but breakfast is excellent. Next to the lobby you will find an excellent bar. The only nuisance is the horning of cars early in the morning."
 May 2015,3,Clean and practical,"This use to be the Sofitel. It is still in good shape but it shows a little bit od deterioration. Buttons in the elevator are mixed or missing. Rooms are just ok. Fridge, flat screen, big closet and safe box. Coffee maker and other amenities. Breakfast is nothing fancy, but even being very basic it does the job. They charge around 15usd per person."
 May 2015,5,Best hotel in Rabat,"Thank you from Mongolian Judo Olympic team. We had Judo World Masters championships in Rabat, Morocco from 23-24 May, 2015. Our team got good result from this competition with 2 gold and 2 bronze medals. We thank for everything for Moroccon people who helped and supported for us. It was great to stay in Le Diwan Hotel. We had three meals everyday and it was really delicius. Also all workers in hotel were very pleasent and professional. Specially in resataurant, reception desk, room service and waiters are exellent with their many languages English, French and Arabic. Mrs. Noura from 2-nd floor restaurant served every morning with fresh Coffee and nice Tea. Thank you again and best wishes! Bukhbat Madhbat, General Secretary of Mongolian Judo Association"
 May 2015,5,Great concierge service,"There are lovely, kind and helpful people working at Le Dirwan -- particularly Salah, a concierge. Le Brasserie has great food and service and the housekeepers did a good job and left lilies in our room. Highly recommend Le Dirwan in Rabat."
 May 2015,4,Very nice accommodations,"We didn't know what to expect and were very pleasantly surprised. The hotel was super clean with comfortable bedding, a very attractive and well-appointed bathroom and nice common areas. The building across the street appeared to be empty and looked run-down, but then we weren't staying there, were we. Taxis are not easy to flag down but the staff reassured us and flagged the taxis for us. Travelers should be aware that the taxis seat only three people so plan accordingly."
 April 2015,3,Nice hotel in Rabat,"This hotel formerly known as the Sofitel, is still ok but is not meeting the standards of 5 or even 4 star hotels in rest of world. For Rabat however, it is still a good choice. The location is good, close to city center and close to the bridge to Sale or the airport area, where lot of the business are situtated. The rooms are ok, i read about mold in other reviews, but did not really experienced that. Breakfast is simple but more than ok. Nicest things: the service all over the hotel and the nice food in the Brasserie (although a bit expensive)"
 April 2015,2,Sofitel prices; Motel 6 quality,"This place looks in the pictures like a 5 star hotel. Perhaps in its heyday this was the case, but no longer. The whole place is a bit tired in its decor and the hotel seems to suffer from a mold problem. You can see and smell signs of it everywhere. Perhaps this is why the lobby smelled overpoweringly of cleaning products and perfume...to cover the mold smell which was evident in my room and elsewhere in the hotel. The rooms have seen better days, with stained carpets, black mold on the ceiling in the shower, the wallpaper in the room was bubbling with moisture and mold, and generally everything a bit frayed at the edges. When you turn on the AC is smells of....you guessed it...mold. The windows are small and let in very little light. On my first night, the TV turned itself on‚Ä¶"
 April 2015,5,Money well spent!,"Let me start off by saying this hotel is definitely worth every penny you spend. I got the room with half board so had free breakfast and either lunch/dinner every day. The food is good and the deal is unbeatable. What makes this hotel especially great are his staff. They're all super friendly and go out of their way to greet you and make sure you're having a great time, not only in this hotel, but also in Morocco. They are all bilingual or even trilingual and super super nice. Noura was very helpful as she recommended to me a nearby hammam to have a Moroccan experience. I would definitely come again. Well earned, 5 stars!"
 April 2015,4,Very nice,"The thing that strike me there is the staff.. They are very welcoming,helpful and nice..:-) the hotel is well located - most of the popular places are within walking distance.. The food is good. There is traditional moroccan food and continental.."
 April 2015,3,Dirty coffee cups and no bath towels,"The room is nice. It has a mini bar and safe. There is plenty of space so you don't feel cramped in the least. The room is very quiet even though the ""balcony"" door opens onto a very busy street. With the doors closed, you here very little of the outside noise. The reception desk staff is helpful and seem to speak English as well as Arabic and French. I would have certainly rated this room higher had there been bath towels in the room upon arrival. Additionally, both of the coffee cups in the room had clearly been used...but not by us. It makes me wonder a little about the attention to detail being taken."
 April 2015,4,Good quality and well located,"I stayed here for three nights while on a business trip to Rabat last week. The hotel is very well located: you can walk pretty much everywhere (although Rabat as capital city so not as exciting as some other Moroccan cities). My room was very quiet, wifi worked fine until the last morning so I had to go work on the mezzanine. There is a good selection for breakfast, but most of the 'hot' foods were warm at best. The service was very efficient and friendly so special thanks to those at the front desk, especially the young lady who checked me out."
 April 2015,4,A superior first class hotel....centrally located,"The hotel is within a mile of the Tour Hassan, Rabat Archaeological Museum, and Mausole Mohamed V. The Chellah and Kasbah of the Udayas are within two miles of the hotel. Le Bar Xo is open every night with a vibrant jazz atmosphere. The La Brasserie restaurant is a Parisian style brassiere that serves delectable seafood cuisine and Moroccan dishes. Guest rooms feature comfortable furnishings and a variety of contemporary amenities, such as free WiFi, air conditioning, and an in-room safe. Need to be close the city's embassies? Stay here and you're within walking distance."
 March 2015,5,Amazing breakfast and great room,"Stayed here for two nights and what a pleasure. The staff is very accommodating with great attention to making sure all our needs were met. My room was great, clean, very comfortable beds and a great shower/bath area. Meals eaten here were extraordinary, breakfast with many choices and dinner at LaBrasserie, fantastic. Definitely a good place to stay while in Rabat."
 March 2015,4,A good business hotel,"The Diwan Rabat is a very comfortable business hotel. The beds had lovely duvets blankets and duvet mattress covers. The in-room WIFI was fast and there were no interruptions while we stayed there. I especially liked the small Spa on the lower level where we had excellent hamman-massage treatments. In the private hamman (steam room), I had the most amazing scrub before my massage (I felt like a muddy puppy being scrubbed by a Downton Abbey scullery maid). The scrub itself felt great and my skin was silky afterwards. The hotel restaurant, La Brasserie was also outstanding ‚Äì French bistro atmosphere serving French and Moroccan dishes."
 March 2015,5,Will definitely return,First time to Rabat - and I will definitely return to Le Diwan on my next visit. Great bar lounge and small enough to be personal yet very professional and pleasant staff. Comfortable beds and lots of light - I enjoyed the street views The manager Omar was very accommodating and pleasant - felt like they knew me after only a day. The conceirge (Salah) also helped me make the most of the few windows of time I had in this beautiful city.
 March 2015,5,Stayed just one night last week & really enjoyed it!,"We stayed at this hotel for just one night while on a Gate 1 tour of Morocco. We didn't pre-select it and were pleasantly surprised by the tour operator's choice. The staff is quite pleasant and efficient. Our luggage was delivered to the room promptly upon arrival. All questions during the stay were answered with a smile. The room and the the entire property are very clean. The bath amenities are of good quality. The hotel supplies hair conditioner, which, as we discovered during the rest of our trip, was a rarity at most hotels in Morocco. The WifI access is free and works well throughout the hotel, although the signal is stronger in the lobby. The location is perfect; the hotel is close to contemporary art museum and to the royal palace. The bath tub may be a bit‚Ä¶"
 March 2015,4,lovely staff and super clean,"really good professional hotel close to medina and all government offices. Hotel rooms are large, very clean and sharp. Internet very good. staff is really welcoming and lovely. would definitely come back. rooms on street side can be noisy if window opened. better to choose room on north side"
 March 2015,5,LeDiwan Rabat Review,"After a lengthy plane and transport ride, our group was greeted by the hotel's concierger, Greloh. He was very helpful, knowing we needed to find a place to eat, while settling into our rooms. Thank you Greloh and staff for making us feel so welcome!"
 March 2015,4,Great location attractive hotel,Hotel is an easy walk to parks and museums. Nearby is a grocery store grocery. Waterfront is easy walk. Also easy walk to the medina kasbah. Interior is attractive. Wifi and works fine but a bit slow. Several restaurants are s few blocks away.
 March 2015,4,Good hotel in a strategic position,"it is located near the medina and near the rail station. By the way in Morocco use the train system which is punctual and clean, with very kind passengers willing to help the visitors. The hotel is good and clean the room is comfortable and large. The staff is kind and helpful. All together a good experience."
 March 2015,3,soso,"There was a bad odor in the room. Not good cared but cleaned. Good temperatured. Comfortable. Safety case was very small. My 13inch pc did not fit inside. Rooms are big enough. Bath of the room was strange. Shower on the wall was mounted on my chest level. I had to bend down to get wet completely. Hotel is not so big. So the restaurant is not so big. But menu, service quality and the food quality are very good. Good coverage and above avarage quality of wireless internet. Kind staff but most of them knows only arabic and french. Almost near the center."
 March 2015,5,I will return to this hotel.,"Mumtaz. My stay has been excellent. I have enjoyed myself and the everyone have treated me very well. Noura served me and helped me find the Embassy, by giving me a map of the area. Her English was excellent and she also spoke in Arabic."
 February 2015,4,Enjoyed our stay,We stayed in the Le Diwan Rabot as part of a Gate One Tour package. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Service was great. This hotel is in a very good area of town and is close to several good restaurants as well as shopping.We would stay here again.
 February 2015,5,Nice breakfast,Nice morning and very kind waters i remember the name of asmae she was very helpful and the moroccan food was very good think you diwan hotel. Rooms are also very clean dry and warm . Even the nosy street rooms are so calm its my first time i feel so happey of sevices in a moroccan hotel
 February 2015,4,Friendly staff good location,"This is a business oriented hotel. The rooms are very nicely equiped with in room coffee maker, fridge comfy bed and nice large TV. Bathroom is modern and very well stocked. I was quite pleased with the staff with Sala one of the conciergesiss a great asset for the hotel. Rooms are well kept and cleaned by their housekeeping staff. I did not use the spa or attached restaurant as I nearly always avoid these food establishments. I"
 February 2015,5,Great stay. Clean. Good service,First trip to Rabat.. Hotel was convenient location.. Clean and friendly.. Concierge was great.. I believe selah... Restaurant was very good also.. Easy walk to downtown area and art museum that was close by is worth an hour of your time..
 February 2015,5,Very convenient hotel in Rabat,"We stayed for 3 nights early February 2015. Rooms are very clean and modern. Hotel is very well located, close to restaurants, sites and train station. Breakfast was very good. Staff very friendly and helpful. The concierge, Salah, provided us with very good service and advice on the city. Nice view from room. Strongly recommend hotel. Prices are very reasonable by international standards."
 January 2015,4,Nice Hotel with Good Location in Rabat,"Nice hotel in good location in Rabat. Within walking distance to many restaurants and shopping. Room was clean and quiet and bed was comfortable. Hairdryer in bathroom along with plenty of toiletries. Small balcony with an interesting view of the city and if you look in the distance, you can see the Atlantic. Free WiFi was promised in the hotel lobby area only but I had no trouble accessing it in our room also. Breakfast buffet was on par with all the other hotels we stayed at during our time in Morocco. Decent selection but food was never hot ... sometimes luke warm at best. We also heard from other guests that the coffee was not hot either. Had to search out spoons which seemed to be in short supply or non-existent at every hotel and when they say that breakfast starts at‚Ä¶"
 February 2015,5,Outstanding customer service,"From arranging a tour, to reserving restaurants, to sweets and water in my room, everyone was doing everything to make our stay fabulous. Hotel has nice bar and delicious French restaurant. Oh, and rose petals on the bed! I will return!"
 March 2014,5,An all in one Hotel,Le Diwan made my vacation in Rabat amazing. It was just like a cherry on top of a delicious cup cake.The breakfast was amazing and would suggest to add this on.I found each and every stuff helpful and kind specially Noura from breakfast service. The Hotel is situated at the heart of the city so it was very easy to get everything i wanted nearby. The cleanliness and comfortability of the room made my staying there a lovely experience. If any one is going to Morocco and staying in Rabat then paying a visit to Le Diwan is a must. By the way they have an amazing bar as well.
 February 2015,5,perfect hotel,this hotel was perfect choice due to many factors: - its location is in the down town near everything. - the hotel and the place was clean and calm. - the staff is very professional and was dealing with intemicy attitude.
 January 2015,3,"Decent for Short Stay, but nothing longer than that","This hotel was average, the room was clean and location was good. The staff was courteous and polite. The Breakfast croissants were really nice. The coffee maker did not work and the food in the hotel was mediocre. The elevator doors, close really quickly so be sure you are not stuck in one of those! The room upkeep is also not the best, the door knob was broken, the key card switch had come off etc Overall if you want a two/one day budget stay, this hotel is fine for that, but nothing longer."
 December 2014,4,Good Rabat Hotel,"Hotel is close to station, and within walking distance from most of the historic sites. Close by is the excellent tram sysytem. Breakfast has plenty of choice, and good quality. Reception staff helpful. Close by are several restuarants near the station."
 January 2015,4,Great Location,The hotel is located in a new part of Rabat. It is a great location to walk to different areas of the new part of Rabat. Was able to receive internet services in the room itself and the breakfast was great.
 December 2014,3,"very nice room and staff, but free breakfast,not so much","we checked into the hotel in the afternoon and we were greeted nicely, the room was very nice and comfortable, but even though it was quite cool outside, our room was warmer than we liked. we turned the thermostat to the lowest, but to no avail. we booked the room with a free breakfast the breakfast room was nicely set up but being an american, and being spoiled by european breakfasts, this was very lackin and i had some coffe and orange juice and a couple of bread items. no eggs (except hard boiled -they were soft boiled) no potatoes till next day. oh well , like i said, the staff was very nice, i had a massage at the spa, which was wonderful and the room was very nice and the hotel located near a few nice restaurants, so i guess, i would say average, oh and watch out for‚Ä¶"
 November 2014,5,Very comfortable bed!,"We arrived after flying from NYC to Paris to Casablanca then bus to Rabat. We were exhausted and were able to check in early so we could take a nap. It was so nice to climb into a very comfortable King bed. Staff were very friendly. I am pretty stingy with my excellent ratings but this was a winner. The room was clean and modern, with a small balcony that looked out toward the ocean (which you could barely see over the rooftops). We had dinner in the bistro, which was excellent. We started with foie gras de canard, a guilty pleasure. This must be one of the last countries you can buy it in. Even France is curtailing the practice of abusing ducks to get this exquisite taste. I had lamb with roasted potatoes and Carol had the Tagine of chicken breast cooked in olives and‚Ä¶"
 November 2014,4,Cosy and calm hotel,"The rooms are clean and well isolated. I've been to this hotel twice, 2 months the first time and 2 weeks and a half the second and I don't have anything to complain about. Hotel staff is very polite and the bartenders are very friendly and easy going. I would recommend this hotel for business travellers who want to be in the city centre of Rabat, but also are in need of some peace and tranquility."
 November 2014,5,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"Stayed here on our Gate 1 tour of Morocco. First class place. The hotel and room were modern and in a good location within the city. The staff was very friendly. The only negative is the same thing you find with every good hotel, the in-room food/drink items were quite expensive when compared to outside. Luckily there is a small shop within a couple hundred feet of the front door."
 November 2014,5,Great Property,"This is a very nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff! Beautiful, cozy, and clean rooms awaited my arrival. Television channels are in French, Arabic, and a couple in English. The food in the restaurant was good also. If you prefer to eat elsewhere, the hotel is within walking distance of other restaurants and food vendors. The neighborhood was safe and the locals are friendly. This hotel is only a couple of blocks from the newly opened Mohammed VI Museum for Modern and Contempoary Art."
 November 2014,5,Great,"Service - pleasant/helpful, pointed us in the right direction to the mauri consulate, changed some money, made some photocopies for me. Room - very nice Price - decent 1500 dir for standard king Restaurant - we only had a few dishes as we weren't super hungry, but it was all great. Salad de Nice, foie gras terrine, and pan seared foie gras (yes, big foie gras fans), cream br√ªl√©e, 2 espressos about 560 dir Good complimentary breakfast"
 October 2014,5,Great stay for work trip!,"A great hotel, with very friendly and helpful staff (most, if not all of whom also speak English, which was helpful for me given my weak French and nonexistent Arabic). I stayed for nearly a week, and felt very much at home and taken care of. The restaurant and bar were also excellent."
 October 2014,5,Great city hotel,"A modern, comfortable hotel in central Rabat. The staff were extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble. A great bar for an evening drink with live music some evenings. Bar food also available if you want a more relaxed evening. The room was of a very high standard with a very comfy bed. The bathroom had loads of toiletries and robes. Would highly recommend."
 October 2014,3,Not sure it's value for money,"We had difficulty finding the hotel even asking others. The room was nice and clean. I wish they had a pool. The good thing is the hotel's close to attractions such as the medina, hassan tower and the marina."
 October 2014,4,"Pleasant hotel, friendly staff, good quality/price rate","A nice 4 stars hotel in the middle of the Rabat's residential area. The hotel's hall is definitely dark, but it looks like the locals likes it that way. The breakfast is served in a nice room facing the crowded street below, good choice of food. The rooms are nice, generally clean, even if the bathroom sometimes smelled bad when I came back from work, meaning that they only use some water to clean it up and/or an already dirty wash rag. The bed is comfortable, the pillows are very tall, so sometimes I felt pain in my neck when I woke up in the morning. Sound isolation from the street traffic below can surely be improved especially in the 1st floor rooms."
 September 2014,5,I loved it.,"I particularly loved the people who worked at the hotel. Everyone was extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and made me feel at home my entire stay. Ibtisam, Hasnna, Anwar, Rasheed, Mustpha, Hamid, Meki, Aicha, Siham, Ilham, Yacine, Sanna, Hicham, Mahdy, Asma, Lubna, Nuora, Radwan, Gamal and Omar are all outstanding. It's apparent that your hotel's management is outstanding, as well, based upon the superior service I received. You guys are the best. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I hope to see everyone soon. Best wishes, Sammy Saba"
 October 2014,4,French style restaurant with western prices,"We did not stay at the hotel but just had dinner at this hotel. We were greeted by very friendly staff which really tried to make it a pleasant dinner. That evening we were one of the few guests. We had the impression most guests stayed at the hotel. The menu is based on french brasserie style food although they do have a couple of local tangine dishes, which we went for. The dishes were good and tasteful. The price at this restaurant were very comparable to western european prices. Next time we will probably go to a local restaurant which will likely offer better value/price."
 October 2014,5,Wonderful and so helpful,"I was in Rabat while my husband was in the hospital recovering from an unexpected illness and chose to stay at the Diwan. It is a newly renovated hotel right in the center of Rabat, in a beautiful part of the city. I felt so safe and everyone made me feel so comfortable. The staff went over the top to accommodate and help me. As one can imagine, negotiating the language was quite difficult for me but the hotel staff was so kind and helpful. I was able to step right outside and a taxi was always made available to me. The hotel is immaculate and quiet even tho it is in the city. Plus there is an ATM machine just a few steps away, so I never had to go far for anything. The restaurant located off the hotel lobby was delicious. My thanks to everyone at the Diwan for making‚Ä¶"
 September 2014,5,"Great Place, Nice Service","I was there for about week. The service was very nice, the rooms clean and is pretty well located. Sincerely, after being in others hotels in Rabat, Le Diwan has become my first option for futures visits."
 September 2014,4,A Comfortable Stay at Le Diwan Rabat,"I had a brief stay at the Le Diwan Rabat, however, during my visit, I was comfortable and impeccably treated by the staff. The hotel is located on a busy intersection but don‚Äôt let that detour you: the rooms are quiet. My room was facing the Avenue d'Alger and I could only hear the street noise when I opened the window. I slept without interruptions in a room that was clean, polished, and spacious enough for two. If there was gym, I didn‚Äôt see it because I was distracted surfing the web courtesy of Le Diwan Rabat‚Äôs complimentary Wi-Fi. I also indulged in a beverage at its bar and gorged on croissants during breakfast. Overall, Le Diwan Rabat offers a stylish base for visitors of Rabat, Morocco."
 September 2014,4,Good location + service,"Central location and very efficient and helpful staff. I had a small problem in my room but it was rectified immediately. The coffee machine didn't work but that's fine. Concierge was helpful and patiently answered my questions. Tour Hassan is a nice 7 - 10 mins stroll away and from there, you can stroll over to the medina, etc. Petit taxis are easy to flag down from the hotel and all the drivers knew the hotel so getting back was easy peasy. Some great dining options in the vicinity - I had breakfast at a cafe nearby and one of the best restaurants (per tripadvisor's recommendation, and I agree!) is just around the corner - Ch'hiwates du terroir. Rooms were clean and very spacious. The best part for me was the shoe cleaning machine which apparently has been there for‚Ä¶"
 September 2014,4,Very comfortable and well-located,"This medium-sized hotel is close to the Government quarter, and an easy walk from the Medina and other sights. Although it is on a quite busy road junction, the soundproofing is equal to the task. It can be quite busy, and I could only get a room there for part of my stay in Rabat. The room was a good size, very well-equipped and with some imagination in the design. It was in good condition and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful (though service in the bar area can be a little slow). Breakfast showed a degree of imagination, with the odd Moroccan speciality as well as the standard offerings. This one will definitely be high on my list if I have the chance to return to Rabat."
 September 2014,4,Nice place to stay in Rabat,"Central location, friendly staff (and most speak English) and nice accommodations. The breakfast was a bit overpriced but great views if you're on one of the top two floors. I would recommend this hotel to someone looking for a comfortable, yet affordable place to stay."
 August 2014,5,I Recommend Diwan to stay in Rabat.,"I have been in Rabat many times since 2003. I used to stay at the old Hilton, now renamed Sofitel Jardin des Roses and Villa Mandarine. Recently I switched to Diwan M Gallery hotel (the old Sofitel). This is an excellent hotel if you want to stay in the city centre. It underwent a great uplift inside recently, when it changed brand name and it feels very much like home away from home. The rooms are very nice, comfortable and clean. Above all what is great in this hotel is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. What a difference to the Sofitel Jardin des Roses! ...So for my next trips to Rabat I will use Diwan and/or Vila Mandarine depending on availability. No doubt the two best hotels in Rabat!"
 May 2014,4,"Staff, service and location are hard to beat","Did an extended stay here over Ramadan and was overwhelmed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. From top to bottom they truly made Le Diwan my home away from home. Hotel is well situated for a quick cab ride from the train station (it's within walking distance, but with luggage I would take a cab). Place Mohammad V, the Medina, Chellah, Tour Hassan and tombs are all within walking distance, a short cab ride or by hopping on the new tram line right next the hotel. My room faced the street, but noise was never a problem. On the two occasions where I needed something fixed in the room, a technician was in the room within minutes and the issue was resolved almost immediately - one issue was my fault (I blew a fuse). Breakfast was the best part of my day, I could‚Ä¶"
 June 2014,3,Rabat Le Diwan - Inside Out,"I have to say,the initial impression is a welcome surprise when compared to the surrounding buildings of the older part of Rabat and other hotels in the same area. It has a cozy appeal and the ladies behind the front desk are friendly, cute and helpful despite the language barrier. Some of the male staff such as bartender and waiters could be more friendly to paying guests. I have to single out Mikkey who went out of his way to assist me and make my stay more comfortable. The coffee machine in the room was a real life saver. Rooms are clean and the rest of the establishment in general very neat. Free WiFi was always working well. Breakfast is sufficient, great and healthy orientated. Some degree of variation with meat suggested though. Restaurant has a convenient entrance from‚Ä¶"
 August 2013,4,"Beatiful hotel, very serviceminded people working there","I went here on a business trip some time ago. The rooms are very nice and cool. The people working there are very serviceminded and want to help. I had some issues with my shower that they could not solve, during my one month stay there was almost no pressure in the shower and that was not so enjoyable and the Wifi was slow, but except from that I have only good things to say about the hotel and would gladely recommend it to anyone going to Rabat."
 May 2014,5,Excellent modern hotel,"I traveled with a group for 2 weeks in Morocco and this was the nicest modern hotel we stayed in. The breakfast was very, very nice and the hotel accommodated us by moving us to a conference room where we could more easily hear our after-breakfast speaker. The room was very clean and comfortable. The public areas were gorgeous."
 May 2014,4,Great Start to our Trip,"Loved this hotel. The room was lovely, a good size, a comfortable bed, and the staff was friendly. The breakfast was good. We were able to have a very nice lunch very near the hotel and were able to walk around easily."
 May 2014,3,Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel was wonderful. The rooms were very clean and the beds very comfortable. I only spent 1 night here and didn‚Äôt really get to see what was around the area. However, the location was not very good from what I saw."
 May 2014,4,Friendliness tops all else,"From the time that I arrived at the hotel on my 6 day business trip, I was warmly met, professionally dealt with and well provided for at this European-style hotel. I had a room on the top floor, with a really comfortable bed, large bathroom and Juliet balcony. We found some great little restaurants in the vicinity, and were close to the tram system, although the taxis are so visible and cheap that we often elected to hop in a cab to get to our meetings. All of the staff were really friendly, but especially the restaurant and bar staff. I had no time to try the spa, unfortunately. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
 May 2014,4,Good location,"This European style hotel is well located near the Medina and public transportation. Rooms very clean and comfortable without noise, even in a room facing a busy street like the one we had. Al amenities and free extra bottles of water were a plus. Beds were comfortable with extra pillows and blankets. Staff was great so was the free WiFi. Hair dryer and capability to 110V shavers or to plug you iPhone was working fine."
 May 2014,5,excellent stay!,"Best choice for business and leisure together. the hotel has a very good location, you can reach any business destination in maximum 15 minutes. I was surprised of the size of the rooms. They have the most comfortable beds ever. Very nice and friendly staff. I totally recommend it!"
 May 2014,5,Thank You!,"Rabat was our first stop on a two week tour in Morocco. Having had my medicated body lotion confiscated at the airport because its size was too large for my hand luggage, I couldn't have found a better or nicer one then the complimentary bottle in our bath. The quality of the body creme and scent is fantastic! Thank You! for this wonderful surprise. I t made me feel so much better. I'm sorry that I didn't get to use the spa. So besides this, the hotel room was clean and beautifully decorated, the bed was perfect, and Breakfast was very good. Service was all around excellent."
 April 2014,4,"Friendly Staff, great breakfast -felt European","So I had a 3 night stay here. The Hotel was well appointed -comfortable bed, really nice bathroom. Good restuarant (I can vouch for the croque monsieur). The location was good and walking distance to the Medina and some nice cafe's. My room was on the 2nd floor and even though there is a lot of traffic on the trafic circle that the hotel is on, the double glass windows prevented a lot of the noise from getting in. The drapes were also heavy and kept out the morning light. Just fyi, he incense in the lobby sent my allergies into hyper drive, I'm not sure how you could avoid it. Also when you are done using the shower make sure you put an extra towel down, the water seems to find it's way out, and the floor can be very slick."
 April 2014,4,"Clean, Comfortable, Businesslike","We recently spent three night at Le Diwan and liked the hotel very much. It is a no-nonsense type, modern, medium-size hotel in a good location to restaurants and public transport (the 2 new tram lines). Everything in the medium size room worked well, including the WiFi, the furnishing were a bit on the sparse side, but modern and functional - that includes the comfortable bed. If you did not want to spend extended time in your room, there were pleasant common areas on the ground floor and the mezzanine. The morning coffee did not exactly give you a jolt of energy, but in all, the buffet breakfast was good with something for everyone. We found the reception staff extraordinarily helpful in organizing our nightly transport from the hotel to the airport in Casablanca. Every detail‚Ä¶"
 April 2014,4,Helpful staff. Good location.,"Spent one night at Le Diwan. Easy walking distance to the Archeological Museum and the Medina. Room not luxurious but comfortable. Staff very helpful, not always the case in the hotels we stayed in in Morocco. Breakfast adequate."
 April 2014,4,"Very good, room to improve","Le Diwan is centrally located and right on the two tram lines. The rooms are small (approx. 24 m2), too small for an armchair, floor lamp, side table. The Wi-Fi service is included in the room rate. The service did not go down, but was on the slow side (downloading a 74 page e-reader newspaper usually took 3-4 minutes). There is no peephole in the door, which I found disconcerting, especially when I got a knock on my door at 0615 and didn't know how to sort out what was going on. Along that line, the lifts are disconcertingly dodgy and are in serious need of a complete overhaul. The TV channel line-up is slim, mainly in French, but they do have BBC World News. The mini-bar has plenty of room for your own stuff. The in-room safe is mounted at the right height with plenty‚Ä¶"
 April 2014,5,Very nice hotel,I stayed 3 nights and everything was very good. The room is spacious an bed is very comfy. Bathroom is very nice. Breakfast buffet is excellent. The staff is very helpful and welcoming. The free WiFi in the room is super. I can ask for no more!
 March 2014,5,Comfortable Hotel,"We stayed for one night as part of a Gate 1 tour of Morocco. The hotel room was comfortable, it had wi-fi and even a coffee pot in the room. The breakfast was expansive. We were tired being our first night, so we ate in the hotels restaurant. The food was well presented and pretty good. This hotel is near the tram line and the archeological museum. Would stay here again."
 March 2014,4,A lovely hotel in the middle of the new city,"Our first night in Morocco and this is a tourist, businessman's hotel offering clean, large room with a lovely bathroom. It was easy to walk to the the Medinah. There is a square across the street where there are a number of restaurants open for lunch and dinner that were good. Breakfast buffet was included and was typical Moroccan. Free wifi in the room was a plus."
 March 2014,4,Very Comfortable,I spent just one night here...my first night in Morocco. Jet lag plus a bit of culture shock. This hotel was highly satisfactory for both. Very close to a supermarket and liquor store...important when you've been fed airline food for hours! Our room was quiet and the staff were very friendly. We were two women and we felt perfectly safe both in the hotel and in the neighborhood. Breakfast was plentiful....a nice selection. I can highly recommend this nice hotel.
 April 2014,4,Nice Hotel within Striking Distance of the Medina,"My wife and I spent one night at Le Diwan Hotel as a part of a Gate 1 Travel tour group. This is a rather nice hotel in easy walking distance to the Royal Enclosure, the Mosque. The staff is extremely professional and courteous. Eating at the hotel can be a bit pricy, however there is a little sunken square about a quarter mile from the hotel where the city comes out to eat and see and be seen. The medinas both old and new are about a fifteen minute walk away down Mohamed V Avenue. The free wi-fi is a nice touch and the speed both uploading and downloading was efficient. The included buffet breakfast was nice though nothing spectacular. I would recommend Le Diwan to anyone looking to stay in the area."
 March 2014,4,Clean Hotel and Pleasant Staff,"We with a tour group and stayed here for our first night in Morocco. Morocco is a massive cultural shock to begin with but this hotel helped eased our transition. It was located one block from the Tram, 1 1/2 blocks from a supermarket, a block or two of a number of embassys and upscale homes and schools but you could either take a short cab ride to the medina. The hotel is located on a very busy street and care was needed to be taken to cross it but you could not hear the street noise when you were inside the hotel. Staff was extermely helpful and pleasant. I had a recommendation to a resturant near the medina and upon inquire the front desk clerk told us it should be still open (we arrived late to the hotel and it was 3:00p.m and starving) but then he checked with 2 other‚Ä¶"
 April 2014,4,mixing the cultures,"I appreciate my staying there in this hotel for few but important reasons: it's a sort of european hotel mixed with the smile, the caring of the moroccan people. So you can find what you would like to find there (very clean place) and in the same time a smile of someone who can help you in your needings. I didn't have the chance to ""use"" this hotel as it should, because of my quick stayin there but I appreciate it. I put 4 ""stars"" and not 5 only because Le Diwan is in the downtown, very close to the heart of the town with his goods and bads (trafic). The rooms in front of the streets have 4 glasses (2 double windows glasses, that means they do all is possible to surpass the problem) but the noise of outside could be ""hurt"" someone. But the bed is super comfortable that you can‚Ä¶"
 March 2014,4,Good choice for business,"Le Diwan is centrally located close to many ministries and the train station making it a good choice for business. it is also close to many of Rabat's main attractions so its good for sightseeing as well. The rooms are small but modern and wifi is pretty good. Try to get a room in the back, they are a bit more quiet. The staff is very helpful and attentive except in the restaurants. Breakfast is simple (and the coffee is bad), the restaurant is nice but there is better food to experience in the many restaurants all around."
 April 2014,4,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel, nice service in the perfect location the staff were very nice and welcoming besides its very clean and organized for instant ull feel like its a 5 stars hotel, it worth the price honestly, and its near all the city center only few mins walk n ull be there."
 March 2014,4,"Nice, well-located hotel with great breakfast","Family and friends stayed here on a recent 8-Day Affordable Gate 1 Travel Tour of Morocco. Bed was comfortable, staff was efficient, and breakfast was outstanding in variety of selection, freshness, and service."
 March 2014,5,Excellent City Centre Hotel,We stayed a week in this hotel and found it to be excellent for one in the City Centre. The restrauant was first class and the room well appointed with good servicing and its own coffee machine. It was slightly noisy being in the centre of the city but we got used to this after the first night. While there are hotels in more salubrious surroundings this one is so convenient for all the main sites. Make sure you visit the ruins at Chenni while there.
 February 2014,3,Good hotel,"Nice, clean, modern hotel. Comfy bed, kettle with instant coffee and tea, a complimentary bottle of water, frig. Bathroom included robe, tub, magnifying mirror, hair dryer, and bidet. Breakfast very nice. Large closet/wardrobe. Limited outlets. I was in room 110 for one night. Please see my photos for more room details. I would stay here again. If you found my review helpful, please click on ‚Äúyes.‚Äù Thanks."
 March 2014,5,Nice hotel in good location,Had very large room with comfortable bed and pillows and free WiFi. Room was very modern and clean with nice furnishings and bed linens. Location was good near center of town and a short walk to a few restaurants. Good breakfast selection and service.
 February 2014,4,Nice hotel with spacious rooms,I stayed at Le Diwan Rabat on the first night of a Gate1 tour of Morocco. I had a sixth floor room with a balcony. The room was spacious. Nice bathroom with good water pressure. Very nice breakfast buffet. Free wifi throughout hotel. Within walking distance of various restaurants.
 February 2014,4,"Great location, wonderful bed...","We stayed in an exclusive double room on the 5th floor. It was large, and even though facing the busy street, was rather quiet. The bed and bed linen were wonderful and made for a good night sleep. Lots of place for clothing, and since we stayed for a whole two weeks, it was just what we needed. Breakfast buffet is served in a dedicated breakfast room on the mezzanine floor. Adequate, but a little boring after a few days. Lots of wonderful nuts and dry fruits, m√ºsli , youghurt etc. But the devil is in the details: the warm food (sausages, tomatoes, fried potatoes, soups) was not warm!!!! And the eggs menu rather limited. The croisants and petit pains de chocolate were dry. And whole grain bread was missing. The hotel has a very good restaurant ""La Brasserie"" (lunch and‚Ä¶"
 February 2014,4,Third visit,"Again perfectly satisfied. Nice roooms, excellent restaurant. Glad to return next time. Business hotel but with local taxi service you can easily go to the Medina soukh, not expensive. A short walk and you will find local shops ans restaurants for a simple and cheap bite."
 February 2014,4,Good location for a short stay,"I only stay one night at this hotel while on an escorted tour. For the location and general comfort it fits the bill. Location: walkable to most attractions with some directions. The medina Its only 20minutes walk and an enjoyable one with nice hotels and cafe along the way. We walk back at 7pm and is still safe, just follow the tramway tracks toward the medina. Breakfast: actually it was quite good with excellent service, did go down early to avoid the crowd to avoid any problem based on the previous reviews. Really like the bread station which had different types of breads from Morocco...and they are all good. Comfort: Clean, everything works but not all the rooms have coffee pot for coffee and tea."
 March 2014,4,Good choice for location and comfort,"The hotel's location is excellent. It is an easy walk to the main eating and shopping areas  of Rabat's  old city  as well as the Royal Palace and City Walls. In addition, several restaurants and the flower market are within a couple blocks of the hotel. Public areas were nicely furnished with modern, comfortable furnishings. The rooms were similarly furnished with very comfortable mattresses. Other than hearing street noise  the front facing rooms of the hotel  and some cracked tile  in the bathroom, our stay was perfect. Breakfast offered excellent variety of hot and cold foods with excellent service. Our time here did not disappoint and we would return. Our internet service was fine, even from our room."
 February 2014,4,Good ‚Ä¶..but,Excellent hotel - but breakfast service left us stressed out. Wide range of foods - the best we experienced in Morocco. But staff were incapable to provide tea & coffee at breakfast. It appeared as if no one had ever requested drinks before. It was like having breakfast at Fawlty Towers !
 October 2013,3,Fair but...,"Good place overall if you're down for business or a short stay. Pros: Great location, good price, and good service Cons: No gym, Internet connection below acceptable and breakfast buffet is basic. Reception and tech support could not care less about our Internet connection so we ended up checking out as we were there for business."
 January 2014,5,An excellent start to our trip,"On our trip to Morocco, we stayed at 6 different hotels. This was the best of the bunch. The hotel is neat and modern, the rooms are large and comfortable, and the breakfast buffet is wonderful. The staff was very friendly and had our room ready for us before noon, which was wonderful after flying from Seattle, WA. I would seek this place out for another stay in Rabat."
 October 2013,4,The place will make you smile,"I liked my whole stay, Le Diwan is a mixture of warm colours that makes you feel comfortable.The rooms are chic and the service is alright. A very helpful reception and nice staff alongside delicious breakfast."
 December 2013,5,The Best Bed of All,"It was a real blessing to be able to spend our first night in Morocco at the excellent LeDiwan in Rabat. We arrived on the early flight, jet lagged and tired, dragging our feet, but once the formalities were completed we were quickly accommodated in a very nice room with the best bed of any on our Gate 1 Kaleidoscope of Morocco tour. WiFi was strong, excellent shower, lovely toiletries, a heavenly bed, top service, a lovely breakfast buffet, good neighborhood. It doesn't get better than this. Shukran bezzaf (many thanks) to the hotel staff!"
 December 2013,5,Superb hotel,"We were happy with our choice for our one night stay in Rabat. The staff were wonderful and did all they could for us. Very clean and spacious room, nice toiletries in bathroom. Very comfortable. Or breakfast was plentiful and of good variety and standard. Close to walk to most sights. We would love to go back again."
 December 2013,5,"Good location, friendly service, good food","The hotel is nicely located relative to points of interest. The staff was very friendly and the food at the hotel's restaurant was very much better than expected. The rooms were not large, but clean. Rooms on the top floor had the best view and those with even numbers offered an interesting cityscape and view of the ocean. Some reviews I have read were negative to various degrees. This certainly was not our experience. Some tour group use this hotel which leads to some congestion when the groups arrive, but this was handled efficiently by the staff."
 December 2013,5,Excellent choice,"We stayed at the Diwan as part of a Gate1 tour of Morocco and found it to be one of the better hotels we enjoyed during our two weeks. The rooms were clean, wifi connecting was good and the breakfast had more selections than some of the other hotels we staying at. Especially enjoying the selection of dry fruit and dry fruit in honey. Hotel was close to the archeological museum (about three blocks away), an easy walk (about 5-6 blocks) to the gate and walls, and close to a sunken area with a variety of restaurants."
 December 2013,4,"Modern, clean, free wifi","It was our first night in Morocco. We were jet lagged so glad when they let us check in early so we could freshen up before heading out to hit the medina. They offer free wifi. The lobby is quite small and most of their staffs do to speak English. Location is about a 20 min walk to the old city where most restaurants are located. We didn't have an issue connecting to the internet and it was pretty stable and fast. We found only one English speaking channel. Breakfast is standard and very slow service. Page had to ask multiple times for coffee, juices etc. I don't think they are used to dealing with tour groups. Instead of placing juices in small bottle containers, they should invest in a larger dispenser. I had to wait a while also before they replenish plates and‚Ä¶"
 December 2013,5,Amazing stay in a perfect hotel,"Really I spent a wonderful 2 weeks in Rabat with excellent services, complete team are always smiling and showing excellent hospitality, breakfast was amazing with varieties and they never forget what you requested previous day, they prepare it before you request or even before thinking:) really restaurant team were an excellent staff, finally I couldn't forget one of the reception team member who always smiling with cute face. even they know that my favorite team will play today in Morocco and encouraging us."
 November 2013,5,Great First Night,"This hotel was our first night in Morocco. What an excellent beginning to a great tour. The rooms were very nice. The location is excellent. The breakfast buffet was easily the best of the trip. It was a short walk to a sunken park with four restaurants. Beautiful location, very good food for both lunch and dinner."
 December 2013,3,Brasserie restaurant is disappointing..again,"I am a regular visitor to the restaurant. But tonight was disappointing. The place wasn't busy, the staff know me, made me welcome but just did not live up to standards. Boiled rice with brochette of beef itself sounded dull so i ordered potatos. But as has happened beford the extra dish of potayos did not arrive. After asking they turnup after i have finished. And No Apology!!! Sounds small but it ruined my evening, and it is not the first time. the value for money tonight was Poor. I am reluctant to return."
 November 2013,3,could be better,"Good: comfortable beds, Internet connection (even though at times slow), clean bathrooms, chamber maids are nice and helpful in need of improvement: rooms smell badly of humidity, elevators need maintenance, food in the brasserie is greasy, staff is unmotivated. Breakfast is particularly disorganized. Even if you are the only guest in the breakfast room and there are 5 servers milling around, they still do not manage to serve you coffee. Every morning you have to go in search of coffee spoons, napkins, etc. It's almost funny. Another funny thing is that all of this has been mentioned many times on Tripadvisor, and each and every time management responds by apologizing and promising that things will get better. But obviously this is just a phrase and there is no willingness‚Ä¶"
 November 2013,4,Comfortable Beds,"The room was nice & clean with a small balcony. Not the greatest view of the city, but it was nice to be able to step out for some fresh air. The restaurant was fairly good, but very limited as far as vegetarian options. However, the desert was excellent, The beds at Le Diwan were the most comfortable I've encountered at any hotel. There was a thick & cushy mattress topper on both beds, which made it very easy to fall asleep rather quickly, despite the noisy guests in the room next door."
 October 2013,4,Checked!,"The location is good for business porpoises, the only detail is the parking and the chance to park in the close area. In the close area during the night there is not too much animation, but the city is not very open to night activities."
 November 2013,4,Stop over,Excellent service and helpful staff. Room was clean and fresh. i liked the food in the resteraunt. The location is close to the centre of Rabat and made for plesant walking to sightsee. The downstairs bar had a lovely atmospere and frriendly bar staff.
 November 2013,4,Nice hotel,"We stayed for one night. The room was clean and nicely furnished. The bed was comfortable. The washroom was also nice with one of the better showers we had during our two weeks in Morocco. Location was good; about a 5 minute walk to the Mausoleum, and about a 10 minute walk to the medina. Service is average. Staff are professional and efficient but not overly friendly. Wifi is okay. The signal is a bit weak. The rooms are not very soundproof. We could easily hear noise from other rooms as well as the trains a couple of blocks away. I would stay here again."
 October 2013,4,good hotel,"This hotel was booked as part of a trip I booked with gate 1 travel and they did a great job sending us to comfortable places to stay. Le Diwan Rabat had clean and comfortable rooms, a nice restaurant, and a comfortable bar-- they brought us complimentary snacks with our drinks at the bar which were very good. The location was great; it was an easy walk to several attractions and it was in a safe area."
 November 2013,4,NOT FOR NON-SMOKERS,"I spent 3 nights here on business. The room and bathroom are good for the price. The ar. con works. Friendly staff. Only drawback is that smoking is allowed everywhere, including the restaurant. But I suppose that's the norm for Morocco."
 October 2013,4,Nice hotel,"I experienced this hotel this week for 2 nights and i think i will come back if i have choice . - reception, personal are nice and profesionnal. - Room (suite) was very good, clean and well furnished. Maybe a little bit old fashion :) - The hotel is well located in center and also even if the place is very busy, the room are not noisy (2 windows to avoid noise disturbance). - breakfast is good and personal is very nice and helpful. - Room service is fast and good. I even came back 2 days after to experience the Brasserie for an early dinner and i was happy to eat something good in place that really looks like a good Parisian Brasserie. nice and helpful waitress also. Maybe the only bad point is that there is no swimming pool. Now i think it deserves its 4 stars and i will‚Ä¶"
 October 2013,4,Great hotel,"I spent one week at Le Diwan hotel for business trip, it was nice! The room was clean, the breakfast was awsome and the team was friendly. The location of the hotel was a great since i had an easy access to the whole city."
 October 2013,4,Good 1st night in Morocco,Good hotel. Room was clean and bed and pillows were comfortable. A working shower with good water pressure was a plus! Friendly staff(front desk and porters). Also close to shops and restaurants. Only downside was wifi was very slow.
 September 2013,4,Moraccan Point of Entry - Good First Impression,"Arrived at the hotel as part of gate 1 tour after two red-eye flights. The hotel was clean, the room was modern and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was excellent -- fresh fruits, pastries, meats and healthy choices. The staff was very friendly. The hotel was also within easy walking distance of shopping, site seeing and places to eat. Wish we had more nights here."
 September 2013,4,Comfortable hotel with a few downsides,"I spent three nights at the Diwan on a business trip to Rabat. It is a pleasant place, not too luxurious, with all the basic comforts. Good bed, silent room, lavish bathroom (I consider a good shower one of the real indicators of the quality of a hotel), satisfactory breakfast buffet, the hotel also sports little precious commodities such as an espresso machine in every room. The staff is also very kind and helpful, both at the front desk and at room service. However the good impression is tainted by a few little downsides: the Internet in the bedrooms is only cabled Ethernet, no WiFi, which is rather uncomfortable in these times of WiFi-only mobile devices. And it is also dead slow, moreover some configuration in the network devices prevented me from using my company's VPN. ‚Ä¶"
 September 2013,4,Very nice front desk staff,This hotel is located in somewhat of a run down residential area. We did manage to find a restaurant in a plaza area a block away. The hotel itself is very comfortable. The bed and down pillows were great. The front desk was very helpful and patient with all of my questions. The breakfast very good with a variety of foods.
 September 2013,3,"Wifi is as slow as dial up, not good for business.","If you are looking to get work done thru wifi, it's terrible and slow. For two days, I had a hard time even loading Google maps. Sending a email thru Yahoo mail was very slow. Be aware! Very nice hotel, decent service and no fringe benefits. Comfortable beds, clean linens and property is well maintained. I will never understand why they just do not give the breakfast etc. Some people get it, some don't. If they completely upgraded their Internet service it would be a perfect business hotel."
 August 2013,5,"Best bed, pillows, bathroom, products","Very comfortable room, great location, service minded staff. I stayed there for 5 weeks, and it felt like home. The staff did their outmost to make me feel welcome. Outside the hotel you're in walking distance of Medina de Rabat, The Royal Palace, the train station, Hassan Tower and the very center of Rabat with its shops, archades and cosy caf√©s. The area around the hotel offers plenty of restaurants. You can also choose to eat the the Brasserie, Le Diwan's own inhouse restaurant. Enjoy a cold drink or a cup of espresso in the hotel bar. It's a cosy place to relax."
 August 2013,4,good for business,I stayed a couple days for business and with the exception of the bathroom which has not seen a major redecoration for years (but in perfect working condition) all were great at this hotel. Nice surprise: the espresso machine.
 August 2013,5,"Best bed, pillows, room, breakfast.","Its v conformable rooms and bath, i could sleep in such great pillows, clean bathroom with nice style. Room service is often ready. Breakfast with sweets, chocolates, crepes, fresh juices, fruit salads, chocolates...."
 August 2013,4,Less than five mins walk from the only (found!) Irish bar in Rabat!,Clean hotel centrally located. Rooms comfortable. Staff very helpful. Breakfast not the best though! Easy parking right outside the hotel. Just walk down the hill outside the hotel and you will find the only Irish pub in Rabat!
 August 2013,3,B√§ttre √§n jag tyckte from b√∂rjan,"So after changing my room to a second one then was upgraded to a suite after the first night; finally ""the supposed to have from day one room"" was found. I would like to thank those who helped to make this happen. I still strongly believe that any 4 star hotel should make sure this happens on the day before anyone checks in. There is no one to blame here really but personally i expected from a 4 star hotel to have a working Air condition in the room, don't you? The hotel was fully paid with a ""gold amex"" through my work agency in stockholm. Plus + Central location + Bed (mine was king size) + Room size + Spa Minus - Breakfast - No air condition in lobby or corridors - Expensive (taking into consideration the last two points)"
 June 2013,5,Would stay again,"I stayed here with part of a tour group at the end of June. We only stayed one night but this was one the best hotels we stayed at in Morocco. It was clean, had friendly employees, comfy beds and strong wifi. The restaurant was smoky (as is everything in Rabat) but the food was excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you're staying in Rabat."
 July 2013,5,Don't miss a trip to the spa!,"Really lovely hotel. Great hammam and massage. The restaurant is lovely - try the sole. Smoky bar like everywhere. Great staff . Clean as could be, easy to get by with English. Will visit again. Helpful front desk"
 June 2013,4,Central Novotel Hotel,"Very nice, rooms were very spacious, staff was pleasant. Bar on the main floor was great. Staff all spoke English. Great location in the middle of the business district. Interior rooms had a view of the garden and were very quiet."
 July 2013,4,My preferred business hotel,"Having experienced Sofitel around the world but also other hotels in Rabat, Sofitel Diwan has my preferenced for business purpose. Good and clean rooms, correct breakfast (though a bit expencive compared to the room discounted price), good restaurant and international bar. Above everything, the sleep quality is good which is extremely rare in center town due to combination of environmental noise and poor standard for constrution materiel. If you want to sleep well, go to Diwan."
 July 2013,4,"Dull on the outside, sophisticated on the inside","Don't let the hotel's drab facade fool you -- this hotel is sophisticated and slick on the inside. Curving marble staircases, lots of glass, everything laid out in a balance of utility and aesthetics. The room is spacious and the bathroom is particularly attractive. The restaurant is pretty good, too. The view from the balcony is nothing special -- and Le Diwan seems to know it, because the balcony is really just an overgrown window sill, with hardly room for more than standing -- but I blame that on Rabat, not the hotel! Definitely a good choice if you're travelling to Rabat."
 June 2013,5,Perfect choice,I have been to Morocco before but this was my first trip to Rabat. I decided on this hotel because of its central location and positive tripadvisor reviews. They didn't steer me wrong! I was pleasantly surprised by the front desk staff who were more than comfortable in English as my French was pretty rough and my Arabic.....well there is none! We were given a very spacious room and although I had seen a couple of reviews complaining about the noise the double paned windows kept us from hearing any of the traffic outside. The bed was a dream and we were provided a plethora of pillows. Bathroom amenities were excellent and cleanliness top notch. Basically the room hit all of my must haves. The hotel itself was of course very central allowing us to walk pretty much anywhere‚Ä¶
 June 2013,4,Pleasantly surprising,"After sorting through the many options as I planned my first trip to Rabat (and to Morocco for that matter), I settled on the Diwan mostly for price and a general appreciation for other Trip Advisor reviews. I appreciated the attentive staff at the Front Desk, the very clean and modern rooms with amenities, the lobby bar/cafe and the location. The staff were comfortable in multiple languages and politely humored me with my rusty French. Although I transferred later on to the Tour Hassan nearby for a conference, I much preferred the staff and rooms from the Hotel Diwan (and the price)."
 June 2013,4,"Clean, central, and comfy","Le Diwan is fashionable, comfortable, and well-located. The rooms are very clean, the pillows are billowy and the beds are soft. The water pressure is strong, making for a luxurious shower. There's a great collection of contemporary art work throughout the hotel making it feel very modern.  We used the spa for a $15 manicure and $5 eyebrow wax and we were very satisfied with the quality of the service. There are many restaurants within just a few blocks, including a tasty creperie around the corner and several cafes with traditional Moroccan food in a plaza. We were able to walk wherever we wanted, including to the central souk. Breakfast at the hotel was plentiful with lots  of fresh fruit and Moroccan pastries. Overall, it was a great welcome to Morocco."
 June 2013,3,Classic Hotel,"The hotel is located at a corner with to much traffic. The location is not attractive. Therefore after arriving I asked for a quiet room in the rear part of the hotel. The answer was that all these rooms were smokers and since I' not one I had to take a room in front of the street. The rooms have a double glass window, but still you can hear the traffic. There is no swimming pool or fitness center. The hotel has a good but a little expensive restaurant."
 May 2013,4,"Great breakfast, staff and location","After spending 20 days in Le Diwan in May 2013, I can say: Breakfast: A great selection of fruits, Moroccan breads and pastries, jams and egg dishes. It was my favorite meal of the day. The room service breakfast is impressive too. Staff: The reception staff speak multiple languages easily and are friendly and accommodating. During my stay, without asking me first, the hotel removed the simple hot water kettle (bouilloire) and replaced it with a sophisticated espresso machine. Problem--the machine doesn't produce enough hot water to make tea. When I asked for the bouilloire back, they brought it quickly without any complaint. They also handled laundry service very efficiently. It's expensive, but excellent quality work. Location: Easy walks to train station, medina,‚Ä¶"
 May 2013,4,Very comfortable,"Comfortable, clean and very well located... The staff was extremely friendly and helping, always smiling and ready to help... The rooms were clean and nice; beds very comfortable... Breakfast was okay. The location is excellent and close to the main streets of Rabat. I enjoyed my stay there..."
 May 2013,5,Good place in Rabat,"Good location, easy to locate , clean . Rabat is beautiful , green. We were a group of 16 , the rooms were tidy , clean and proper. Staff very welcoming and assistant , and courteous. You can get proper exchange rate at the hotel, and no need to bother going searching for a bank. We could walk to the ""suwayka souk, "" shopping was a nice experience, leather items were attracting and affordable"""
 May 2013,5,Great Experience at Le Diwan Rabat,I have stayed at this hotel multiple times! The overall ambiance at this hotel demonstrates higher degree of Luxury and made me feel like home. Great location - just a short walk to the train station and most tourist spots in Rabat. Staff have been very friendly and maintain great customer relations. My room decoration made me feel very comfortable and every single furniture has been ergonomically designed. They have great in-house restaurants and offer delicious Moroccan and International dishes. I will definitely stay here again when I visit Rabat as it brings more value for the money I spend.
 May 2013,4,"Very nice hotel, about a 20 min,walk to the Medina","I was traveling with a group of 28 people to Morocco. It was a great place to stay for one night. Rabat is not that exciting, but a good place to sleep after a long flight. The rooms were well appointed. Nice sheets and towels. The food at the restaurant was good. A bit pricey but okay for most. The staff was courteous and very helpful."
 March 2013,5,Highly recommended,"Great hotel, centrally located at walking distance from the city center which makes it an ideal alternative for both business travelers and tourists. Ma family and I had a nice stay there thanks to a friendly staff, comfortable rooms and not to mention La Brasserie, the hotel's restaurant. Overall, Le Diwan is a reliable alternative and good value for the money."
 March 2013,4,Excellent hotel in Rabat just do not take room 104 in front of a noisy clinking air conditioner...,"Excellent hotel, well located and nice rooms with comfy beds and linen. Room 104 had a nice garden terrace but the only drawback was the clinking air conditioner on the terrace just in front of the window..."
 March 2013,3,Pros and cons,"Located within walking distance of Rabat‚Äôs version of Champs Elysees, the hotel was presented as a 4-star property. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a solid 3 ‚Äì small [as in room size - quite a challenge for two adults to move around, and find a place for two average suitcases], quaint, but lacks the welcoming and helpful staff that is a staple at four-star properties, and housekeeping efficiency. Early check in was arranged, yet we found our room unfinished: bed made, surfaces cleaned, but no soap, toiletries or tissues in the bathroom, no glasses for beverages. Though it was March, the weather was warm, and the room was extremely stuffy; a/c was disconnected for the season, so we had to make-do with an open patio door ‚Äì which could not be left open while we were out, since it‚Äôs very‚Ä¶"
 March 2013,4,Overnight trip to Rabat,I recieved a genuine warm and friendly welcome upon arrival. The staff showed excellent customer skills. My room was clean and fresh and the bedding high quality. the evening meal was wonderful and a large menu to choose from. I really enjoted breakfast with the large range to choose from and beautiful setting. Would recommend to any traveller.
 February 2013,4,Pleasant 1 night stay,"We were on a 2 week trip all over Morocco, so my comparative ratings are based on Moroccan experiences. Very pleasant room, comfortable bed, modern bathroom. Terry robes and slippers were especially welcome. Breakfast buffet was extensive and tasty, but the room was very crowded and the staff couldn't keep up with the table turnover and food/juice/coffee replenishment."
 February 2013,4,Good choice in Rabat,"My husband and I stayed here for one night as part of a Gate 1 Travel trip to Morocco. The check-in area was tight so our tour manager had us sit in the bar area until he had the rooms straightened out. Very small elevators could fit only a couple of people with luggage at a time. The room was very nice and quite comfortable--no complaints. We were able to walk to a park area near the palace without any trouble. There is an outdoor sculpture park (concrete) set down off the street a very short distance from the hotel (walk directly straight out the front door for a couple of blocks--it is on the right). There were several outdoor cafes around the perimeter of the park where we had a less-than-delicious lunch, but we enjoyed the people-watching and the restaurants seemed to‚Ä¶"
 March 2013,5,A great place to Stay in Rabat,"We stayed at this hotel on our first night of a tour throughout Morocco. The hotel is quite nice and we were immediately impressed. We are elderly travelers and had no problems with any of the facilities at this hotel. One caveat, the tubs are slippery and use of the tub mat provided is a must. We were impressed with the fact that almost immediately we were handed a TripAdvisor sticker by a staff member and encouraged to submit our comments following our stay. Our room was renovated, comfortable (great beds) and immaculate. The room service staff was friendly, helpful and noninvasive. They gave us additional supplies quickly upon request. The room was medium sized but quite adequate, as was the bathroom. The shower had great water pressure and temperature and was easy‚Ä¶"
 February 2013,5,LA BRASSEIE for Dinner,"We flew in, exhausted after a long trans-atlantic flight and just wanted a quick meal. What we got was probably one of our best dinners during our stay in Morocco. You must try their chicken tajine. It was the best I had while in Morocco, and I tried it in just about every city over a two week stay. The service was ok, but would have been better I'm sure if only they'd spoken more english, or we'd spoken more french. It's a white table cloth ambiance, but because it's a hotel restaurant, the two nights we were there, it was mostly fellow travelers or businessmen. AS FOR THE HOTEL, THE BEDS WERE ALSO PROBABLY THE MOST COMFORTABLE OF OUR STAY WHILE IN MOROCCO."
 February 2013,4,Good first impression of Morocco,"We got to this hotel around 10.30 am and staff was prepaired to receive our bus tour. They were helpfull in filling out forms and assigning room keys. When asked a question, if the person addressed couldn't quite understand, they fetched someone who could. Most staff were really nice and helpful. Location of this hotel is good-easy walk to all the interesting older parts of Rabat-we had a great time exploring the walls, Medina and Harbour. Rooms were nice and even the streetside ones were quiet. Wi-Fi was good and breakfast was plesant."
 March 2013,5,Beautiful Hotel,"This was our tour hotel in Rabat. It is in the business district. A very modern, nice hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They spoke very good English. We asked them to recommend a nice place to eat. They sent us to a cute little place that had excellent food. The rooms were modern and very nice. WiFI was free and connection was good."
 February 2013,4,Very Comfortable,"We only stayed in this hotel one night with a tour group. The location is good. It is walkable to many of the attractions in Rabat. The food in the restaurant at the hotel was very good, although the service was slow. Overall a very pleasant stay."
 February 2013,4,Pleasant stay for a business traveler,"I stayed at Le Diwan for one month on business. It is clean and the staff are professional. The highlight is the restaurant. The chef makes excellent Tangine (traditional Moroccan dish). Service is more relaxed than what I'm used to coming from NYC but I know it has to do with the food being made fresh and on the spot rather than being rep-prapared and re-heated. Room service is more relaxed and, in my experience (since I'm not proficient in French), unpredictable. As a business traveler it was nice to not stay in a hotel with primarily tourists. Only a few people could speak English but the few who did spoke it perfectly. Travelers who know French won't have any problems communicating with the staff. The only thing missing from Le Diwan is a gym."
 December 2012,5,Properties and service,"Not particularly a tourist hotel but the service is very good. Its location is so central qur allows you acces to any part of the city in just a few minutes, but still in a quiet area to rest. Have a good restaurant with grat people who care for you; i wish to find more variety at breakfast. In short, if you're away from home in Le Diwan people you will meet so kind that will make you feel like family ;) . They work like a family you are part of it, wich makes them better serve. Not worth anything to have a good stay and a disservice and they have a good stay and excellent service. If i come back Rabat would like Le Diwan have a gym ;) ."
 January 2013,3,Expensive booking via online,"I booked the hotel via Accor online, it was even expensive than Sofitel, than I think they must have a reason. At the arrival time they gave me a room towards the street, it was very noisy, at second day morning I changed the room, than it was OK. Overall I payed around 100% more than the Golden Tulip Hotel which is a few hundred meter away, it's not worth for this money, and I don't understand why this hotel belongs to the M Gallery which shall be special in Accor group."
 January 2013,4,Location and service,"The Rabat Diwan has the location and service one needs when doing business in Rabat. Not especially a hotel for tourists but service is above average. When I complained of noise from a nearby room, the manager and an assistant (both dressed in suits) arrived at my door, investigated the matter, and then gave my son and me access to another, quieter room in which to sleep the night."
 January 2013,3,Reviw of my stay,The location is good. The room is clean but small. WiFi is very slow. The image quality of TV is low. It should be changed to cable TV and so on. I do not know the quality of breakfast because I did not eat it. But there are many Cafe where we can take breakfast.
 January 2013,5,Nice Accommodations,We stayed here 2 nights while on a tour of Morocco. The location is 15 minute walk from the Souks. There are many restaurants within walking distance with a wide variety of menus choices and prices. The beds were very comfortable. The room and bath room were very nice. There was free WiFi and safe available in the room. The staff was very helpful when we had questions.
 January 2013,5,Breakfast,"Really they are very kind, their hospitallity is huge, I am feeling same as a I am in my home.Many thanks for their hospitallity.Breakfast contains a lot of food.Every food are very fresh.All waiters are allways smiling.Really I am very happy to see that."
 October 2012,5,Excellent hotel,"This was my second stay at this hotel and, as before, I'm very satisfied. Both my stays was extended visits and in my experience there's always niggles with long stays. Not in this case. The room is very spacious & the bed extremely comfortable. The hotel is very well located, close to everything you might need or want to see. Added to that, you have a very nice view of the city. The staff complements the hotel very well, are always extremely friendly and efficient. I was very impressed with their attitude and willingness to help. They are multilingual, which helps a lot if you don't speak French or Arabic. The cuisine is well thought out and delicious. Breakfast caters for a wide variety. Overall, I'm very satisfied and for me it's one of the best (if not the best) in Rabat‚Ä¶"
 September 2012,4,Refurbished,"This hotel is well located and has a wonderful cuisine, with a pre-selected menu that is worth any money, And the dinner wasn¬¥t expensive. The room also was good yet not very much up-to-dated. But has everything you need to good stay."
 December 2012,4,"Good all-rounder. Modern, clean, comfortable.","This hotel is modern design, business hotel. We stayed for pleasure but found it to be really welcoming, comfortable, and well located. Good value rooms, nice towels and linen. Drinks at bar very expensive. Largely friendly staff."
 November 2012,3,Disappointed,"The main issue with this hotel was the smell. We actually requested that we be moved from the first room we were put in, but the improvement was minimal. We were a group of 12 and all complained that throughout, a musty rather pee like pong pervaded. This meant that we had to keep the balcony door open (difficult with the heavy curtain all the way across) the smell was as though curtains or carpets had not dried properly. They need to review their cleaning or air-conditioning system. Very comfy beds. Nice enough bathroom with hot, powerful shower. Boring restaurant with average food at night. Decent breakfast in light and pleasant dining area. Convenient though uninspiring location."
 November 2012,4,"Good hotel, nice rooms but a bit pricey","Stayed there for a few nights with a small child. Great service and extremely friendly staff, which makes your stay enjoyable. Standard rooms are a bit small especially with a child. Switched to the superior rooms and that was great. I would truly recommend this place even though it is a bit on the upper side price-wise."
 May 2012,4,A great place to stay,"I made my reservation through American express and there was a slight mishap. However, the management team resolved the registration conflict and the stay was great. The hotel is conveniently located. The room was comfortable for 2. All facilities were great and the internet was always working. I would stay again."
 November 2012,4,Second time in this nice hotel,"Free bottled water every day. In the afternoon you will get some nice small chocolate. Room service is very nice and fast. Everything is clean. Last week they organize some evening party with french wine and finger food, also with some local band. Vocal was very good, performing some jazz and rock songs. Last time I had some issues with internet, but now WiFi works fine, no more old problems. Internet speed has not a same speed in all rooms. Every morning you can enjoy some nice breakfast which is looks and taste in very French way - baguette, croissant ... but also some Moroccan pancakes. After breakfast you can a small nap or have some short conversation in huge diwans :) Maybe for some people breakfast area run too slow, but this is very nice way for me, just to have some‚Ä¶"
 September 2012,4,"Good hotel, well located, excellent restaurant, good value","Love this hotel. It was on my prepackaged tour so it was a pleasant surprise. Very nice comfortable room to western business traveller luxury standards. Electronic key card entry into rooms. Restaurant in hotel has an absolutely delicious spaghetti bolognaise, but you can also try the Moroccan tagines here. I had the beef, and it was delicious, not too spicy at all. Hotel is walking distance (2-3 blocks directly out front door) to an underground yet open air plaza with several western style restaurants, and keep walking same direction to main street of Rabat, which is 2-3 more blocks. There you can find many stores, a cool mosque, main train station. You can catch the brand new European style metro right at the hotel. Strongly recommend getting a guide for a tour of the‚Ä¶"
 October 2012,3,Good location,"The hotel is located in city center with easy access to all sights in town. The rooms are OK, but they smell bad. It was raining and water came under the door. I think thats why the rooms are smelly. Check-in and check-out were fast but the breakfast wasn't good. Items weren't fresh. The grapes I tried were dirty, had to clean them on napkins. Breakfast staff don't seem pleased to be there. I would find some place else to stay."
 October 2012,5,Nice Place great service,"This hotel was set up by Gate 1 Travel and they made a great choice with this hotel. We had a great stay at this hotel, it was clean, well equiped and the service was exceptional. The food in the dinningroom was exceptional and the wine from the area was one of the best of our trip. Really enjoyed our stay here."
 November 2012,4,Le Diwan Rabat,"Overall, I this is a good hotel in Rabat. The drawback is that there is no exercise room. There is wifi. The food is good. The hotel is located on a busy intersection close to the light rail line. Gettting a taxi is easy here."
 October 2012,3,Restaurant is the highlight.,I stayed here as part of a group tour. The hotel was nice. Decided to have dinner at the restaurant after reading reviews on tripadvisor. The food was very good and the manager made an extra effort to find a wine that my roommate and I liked. The included breakfast was decent. I would have given this hotel 4 stars if not for the smell of mildew in our room. It really took away from the niceness of the hotel. A few other people in our group also had rooms that had a mildew smell. One other negative was that there was no wireless. Since I have a very sensitive nose I would not stay here again. The smell didn't seem to bother my roommate as much.
 October 2012,5,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for one night as part of the group tour package. Room was comfortable, plenty of hot water, hotel staff very friendly. Breakfast was decent with enough varieties. Didn't eat at the restaurant but some people from our group raved about the food though a bit expensive. All in all, a pleasant stay."
 September 2012,2,AC? Hot water?,"The hotel and staff were pleasant upon arrival. The first night was sweltering hot with no AC and I just couldn't pull it together to call up management and later literally couldn't call management because my phone didn't have any phone numbers. The shower was cold so that was kind of a relief after not having ac all night but soon became too cold. Breakfast was in a nice location with lots of natural light on the mezzanine. After rounding up a few familiar things to eat I sat down and found there is only on salt and pepper shaker in the entire cafe, you have to take napkins off of other tables, and there are not enough plates, bowls, etc. if the place is full. To top it off the staff was rude. After staying for 11 days and pointing at the eggs, and holding up three‚Ä¶"
 September 2012,5,"Very nice hotel, excellent staff.","I stayed here for my first and second nights on my very first trip to Morocco. As I arrived a day ahead of my tour group, I had a lot of questions for the staff regarding cell phone service, where to find a good ATM and/or money exchange, and was always given a very thorough answer with a smile. One kind concierge even walked me to the pharmacy for some allergy medicine that I was in need of. Rooms were comfy and nicely decorated, bathrooms very clean. Food from room service was delicious, the mini bar was well stocked. Location was not the most tourist friendly, but it's very easy to grab a petit-taxi. A solid choice in Rabat."
 September 2012,4,Nice hotel with great front desk service,This hotel was my first stop in Morocco. I was very pleased with the modern appointments of the hotel along with the good room/comfortable bed. I didn't eat here but others in the tour group did with very good reviews. One person took a picture of her food from room service. Another couple said their dinner at the hotel was the best they had in Morocco. Front desk manager was very kind to me as I ventured out to the medina on my first day. Solid hotel in Rabat----more business oriented than leisure....but you won't be disappointed.
 September 2012,4,Great location & excellent restaurant,"This is a well located hotel in the centre of Rabat, which is convenient if you are on business. Overall this is a good place to stay, as rooms are relatively comfortable and WIFI has just been upgraded, giving better in-room coverage and speed. There is no question that the restaurant ""La Brasserie"" is what adds the greatest value to this hotel. The food is excellent and on par with any upscale parisian bistro. Driss, the Maitre D' at ""La Brasserie"" is one of the most professional employees, if not the most, at this hotel. Driss knows how to cater to guests in the purest form of french hospitality: he knows his menu inside out, and his advice is worth any penny you'll spend at this restaurant. Noone makes a ""steak tartare"" as tasty as Driss does."
 September 2012,3,Very well located,"It has confortable rooms with excellent beds The location is excellent becuase it is close to evrery touristic point The breakfast is of good quality WI FI conection is excellent The horel has bas maintaince in certain detalis, for instance the lavatory has the marbel rough or the lift does not have the botton to go down"
 August 2012,4,Great and clean hotel,"Rooms are ok. Not too small. Bathroom is great. Big and spacious. Beds are comfortable. The air conditioning in the room is a bit too laud, so sometimes it may prevent you from falling asleep immediatelly. Otherwise, hotel is very clean, food in the restaurant is very tasty (a bit too pricy, maybe?). Only isse I have is with internet. The way WiFi is set up (24h tokens) is not very functional, because you can not connect several times per day, but only once. So if you exit the room, and come back, and want to reconnect, you can't until the 24h token expires. This is very bad especially if you are a business traveller and need the net urgently. Also, one more bad thing is that when we tried to change the money at the hotel, we couldn't because they had no money to change‚Ä¶"
 September 2012,3,Nothing to brag about it,"Not sure if I liked the location or not. I guess if you were on business it is ok. The bedrooms are good, good bed, good bathroom. Parking can be in front of the hotel. A bit odd to park. Service is flat. Not friendly at all. Don't expect a smile or you will be dissapointed. Would I stay here again? Probably not. In a scale from 0 to 10, I give it a 7"
 August 2012,4,Nice hotel close to city,"Everything is nice regarding this hotel. Only what didn't ok were to loud ventilation even with air-condition was off. Also WiFi doesn't work fine. You can connect with your device initially, but if you disconnect for some time connection to the internet doesn't work anymore. This was the case with two laptops and two phones. Every day we had this problem, it seems that problem disapiers when wifi network extender is restarted, but than again you have only one connection attempt which should not be turned off by guest in order to have internet for 24h."
 July 2012,4,Recommended,This hotel has a great location in Rabat and you can walk to all sites and key areas of the city in a short time. The rooms are nice and very comfortable and come with a small balcony. Room service for breakfast is quite efficicent and staff in the hotel are nice. I had only one problem and that was on the second night there was a great deal of noise from at least one other unit and I was wakened up four times. Although the hotel was not able to contain this noise they moved me to an equivalent room on the top floor and this solved the problem. My only other concern was that your choices for breakfast were limited to a small breakfast of buns and coffee which was expensive for what is was or a huge buffet which was also quite expensive. The mini fridge offerings were also‚Ä¶
 July 2012,3,Very much interior,"I spent a week end at the former Sofitel Diiwan, now is MGallery Diwan. First time in a MGallery hotel. The place is clean and well looked after. Good smell even though there is cigarrette smoking everywhere. Small expensive bar, bad attention from waitress. Decent restaurant although service not up to standards, staff kept on talking to themselves instead of being attentive to their jobs. No swimming pool or bar outside. Next time I wil certainly stay at the Sofitel jardin des Roses a bit far out of town but with nice swimming pool."
 June 2012,2,"""Motel 7""","The French chain Accor, who own the budget ‚ÄúMotel 6‚Äù chain in the U.S., tout this property as among their high end brands. Don‚Äôt believe it. It is at best Motel 7. Going past the unwelcoming doorman and entering the lobby, the smell of stale cigarette smoke is your first impression. Then comes the very cool reception. The untrained and badly motivated staff in the breakfast area are nice people but cannot manage to set the table the same way twice in a row (no napkin on day one, napkin on day two etc. salt and pepper on one table, not on another) or bring coffee when you want it. The up and down service continues, like getting one turn-down service in six days. And while the property is relatively new, the sink leaked, the key card needed replacing 3 times, a light bulb was‚Ä¶"
 April 2012,3,Close to the center of the city,Walking distance to most site and with access to local transportation. No luxurious but rooms are clean beds are very comfortable.
 May 2012,4,Good hotel with some quirks,"We stayed 5 nights while attending a family wedding. Le Diwan is one of the newer hotels in Rabat and centrally located in the downtown area. The hotel has both a restaurant and a lobby bar. The food at the restaurant (La Brasserie) was excellent and considering that it's a hotel restaurant the prices were relatively low and comparable to restaurants throughout the city. Service was very spotty ranging from great to terrible. Bar is small but comfortable with a good selection of drinks, particularly for Morocco. Again, service is spotty. Room was spacious with a large bathroom and HD television with channels in multiple languages. Beds are luxurious and comfortable. Bathroom is very nice with a bath and shower and ample room. Rooms come with two complimentary bottles‚Ä¶"
 April 2012,4,Very nice hotel in Rabat,"Stayed one night at Le Diwan Rabat as part of an escorted tour through Morocco. The hotel is very nice. Clean room, very good sleep quality and nicely appointed. Check in was easy, but we did have a tour guide doing that for the group. The hotel is well located, only a few blocks from Avenue Mohammed V, where there a lot of restaurants/cafes. I would definitely stay here again."
 April 2012,4,Mix impression,"I stayed 2 weeks in the hotel. This is a great place well located with interesting commodities such as tram (50 euro cent for a one way ticket). I recommend it for any business trip. Things on the down side are 1- No gym facilities 2- a tendency to hire inexperience people especially working at breakfast who let you wait for a coffee while they talk or check SMS... 3- food at the restaurant is good but if you want to eat there make sure you have plenty of time. It took 2 hous from the order to the bill .... Again, this is a place you should consider... Lt"
 April 2012,4,Great hotel...,"The hotel was a wonderful place to stay as a business traveler. Pros: The room was very clean and kept up everyday. Food in restaurants was top notch at great price. Wine selection at the restaurants was great. Many local wines... Hotel staff was great and helpful for a non French speaking person. Cons: No wifi in the rooms, wired connection only.... Not much around the hotel to walk to. No pool... No outdoor seating at restaurants. Upon return to Rabat, I plan to stay at the Le diwan again. Would recommend it to any one...."
 April 2012,5,"Great hotel, great people","Upscale, comfortable, very friendly and knowledgeable employees. Excellent restaurant and very good complimentary breakfast. When next in Rabat, this is where I will stay."
 April 2012,5,A friend indeed,"A very clean, well run hotel close to the new Rabat tram system. Offers everything one would expect from a quality city centre hotel with one VERY BIG PLUS. . . . Superb management, hospitable staff - friendly and willing. My wife was unfortunate enough to have had her handbag snatched by two youths on a motor scooter. This happened a mile or so from the hotel. Upon our return,we told Reception staff what had happened. They were mortified and swung into action to help. The manager personally took us to the police station and stayed with us to translate and assist with the form-filling. He was a real friend. He helped take away the sting of a very unpleasant experience. Acting calmly and reassuringly this hotel manager deserves a good customer service medal."
 March 2012,5,le diwan,"A good base from which to see Rabat.. quiet, with room in back. get up high for view of Rabat."
 December 2011,4,American-style hotel in Rabat,"If you want to stay in the Marriott, Hilton, Holiday Inn, etc. while in Rabat -- this is your hotel. Slightly upscale American-style rooms (two beds, plush bed linen, etc., etc.) are on offer along with a very nice breakfast buffet (they're happy to make you eggs, if you wish). One annoying thing is that while there is wifi in public spaces and hallways, there is only wired internet in rooms. Housekeeping staff was incredibly kind!"
 February 2012,3,OK for a short stay,"Located in the center, quite convenient to move around in Rabat. But besides that, nothing exceptional. Rooms are ok and clean. Hotel is very clean in general. Service is friendly, breakfeast staff a bit overwhelmed when busy, breakfeast food is limited in variety but sufficient."
 February 2012,4,"great stay, good location","I enjoyed my stay here. Rooms are really very clean, nice furnishings, very centrally located (walked from the train station to the hotel in about 12 minutes) and right next to a train stop so easy access to anywhere in the city. Staff were friendly and helpful enough, but nothing to write home about. good for the price and would surely come back if I was returning to Rabat."
 February 2012,3,Not fitted with the MGallery standard,"First of all, I was not proposed any reward despite my high rank fidelity program, which is not critical for one-shot guests but is not fitted to the policy of the loyalty program. This hotel is characteristic of the 70s buildings that has not been renovated enough. The rooms are not very furbished, naked wooden desk and dressings of the same kind, cold design and appearance, not fitted with the MGallery Accor positioning for hotel of local flavour. It is allowed to smoke in the lobby so no way to breath fresh air unless you wake up at 05.00AM. On night, the air conditioning is bringing a smoky scent despite being on a non-smoking floor. The breakfast is not very diversified and above all, the staff is numerous but completely inefficient (the drinks are not in self-service so‚Ä¶"
 February 2012,5,Great hotel in Rabat,"Positives: very professional staff, great location (within easy walking distance to many sites), clean and well-appointed room, comfortable bed. Negatives: the view from rooms at the back of the building is terrible, and wifi does not work in the rooms (but works just fine in the second floor conference area). I would definitely stay here again."
 May 2011,4,Great Hotel,"Located close to most of the attractions, a walking distance from the train station (although it is better to take a taxi). Modern design in and out, the rooms are clean and have all the necessary. We didn't get to deal with the staff since our stay was arranged by friends. Overall, a good value for the money, and i would definitely recommend it to a friend."
 January 2012,5,Good food in the brasserie,I had a tagine it the brasserie. It was very tasty and the staff was really friendly. Good choice for dinner
 December 2011,3,"Overall good, but reception can be difficult and unhelpful","The hotel is in the modern area of town, not far from the train station - although you will need a taxi if you have luggage. The hotel is on a large and busy junction / roundabout - it's easy to spot. Reception in the day time can be rather frosty and unfriendly - you need to stand your ground here. In particular, note that the hotel offers 2 almost identical tariffs at the same price for rooms booked in advance - one has breakfast, while the other does not. If you choose the 'with breakfast' tariff, make sure you have evidence of this, as reception by default seem to state that breakfast is not included - even with proof reception still seem to want to make life difficult for you. There's a bureau de change at reception - they will change a bit of cash, but for more than a‚Ä¶"
 November 2011,4,A real Good Choice,"Stayed in this ceentral hotel in Rabat for two nights. Selection was made based on all the essentials and I was not disappointed. The rooms are good, clean and with almost all the fescilities of a four star property. Bed was large and comfortable, free internet across the hotel was a bonus and the hotel houses a very nice restaurant where you can eat authentic Moroccon food. The connectivity is good since you have a metro stop just outside the hotel. Taxis are called on request but the taxi services in itself are bad. There is no metre system and the drivers may really 'take you for a ride'. The famous Medina is a walking distance and so are the other places. Reception staff is nice and well mannered and speaks English, a big relief from the rest of the Morocco specially when‚Ä¶"
 October 2011,4,Very good deal for business trips,"I spent three nights at the Diwan on a business trip. Location is perfect, right in the center of Rabat, surrounded by restaurants and shops. Checking was fast. Staff was friendly and flexible: they rearranged my booking to give me a room that was ready (it was a morning check in). Room was very clean, small balcony, satellite TV although internet wireless was unstable. There is no gym, which is a flaw for such a good place. However there is a spa with very affordable and professional massage, including steam room. What I liked was the perfect balance between affordability and quality of the service. Will definitely go back."
 October 2011,2,Comfortable room but busy location.,"Le Diwan Rabat is a well known hotel at Rabat. It offers comfortable,western style rooms but the room rate for this is way, way too high for what is offered.. The hotel is situated on a very busy square of the city. If you want a quiet stay, be sure to ask for a room on the back of the hotel. The elevators are such oldies you can hear them going up and down, throughout all the hotel, this kept me awake for the night, after already changing rooms. As I'm a light sleeper, this hotel was nothing for me, too noisy. Also beware with breakfast price, I've booked and prepaid,my stay,including breakfast at accorhotels.com while they wanted me to pay the breakfast at the hotel again (so paying double for the breakfast). I just payed it, because a lack of time for any discussion but‚Ä¶"
 October 2011,4,Great place,Wonderful location great hotel stayed here a week
 March 2011,4,Pleasant stay at Le Diwan,"I stayed at Le Diwan on a business trip. The hotel is near the center of town, and was within walking distance of the Medina and the Souk. Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Rooms are a little dated, but clean and comfortable. Internet was slow. The buffet breakfast was great and included a nice variety of choices. There are several good restaurants within a short walking distance. The front desk will exchange currency; there is also an ATM on the same block."
 September 2011,5,comfortable stay,"The hotel is convenient - very near the centre The staff are friendly - eager to help The food was good Only inconvenience was shampoos not being replaced and only instant coffee in rooms. Otherwise, great!"
 July 2011,3,Pleasant hotel,Rabat is a business- and diplomatic- center and this hotel appears to cater to such travelers. Rooms were clean and comfortable but service was lackadaisical--no one seemed to be too anxious to help.
 July 2011,3,"Some good points, some not so good","I stayed here for business and did not pick up the bill, so I can't speak to that aspect. Check in was easy; I had mailed a package of business materials to the hotel earlier in the week from Casablanca and after a simple inquiry the bellman produced the package. There was a personal (word processed) note in my room welcoming me. The room was on the small size but well-appointed. The wood desk was a bit worn in spots. The hotel's location is good (was good for me) and there are several good restaurants within 1-3 blocks. The breakfast buffet (included) was good: pastries, breads, quiche,fruit, fruit cups, cereals, omelette station. Wait service for coffee/tea, fresh squeezed orange juice, omelette. Had occasion to try the room service. Service time was okay, burger was‚Ä¶"
 March 2011,3,Mixed ratings,"Stayed there a few times earlier this year. Good points: central location, efficient welcome and check-in procedure, friendly front-desk staff, rooms small but functional. Weak points: lobby band in the evening sometimes pretty loud until late, rooms might need a bit more thorough cleaning, internet and power sockets in rooms should be replaced, breakfast below average in terms of selection and tidyness of restaurant. All in all, ok for a few days but not for longer then 3 nights. Limited recreational facilities."
 June 2011,5,Nice hotel excellent Staff,"This is a nice hotel, 5 stars service, lovely hotel staff. Book your room now !!! . I spent 2 night in this hotel and i was really please... Free breakfeast and free Internet, this is really a five star hotel ... Really good price."
 May 2011,3,"Nice hote, but can be better","Very friendly services and very good food in the restaurant. However, the room was noisy at night; the bathtub was not extremely clean; refrigerator in the room did not work; and wifi was working discontinuously. Considering the above, the hotel is too expensive."
 April 2011,1,The most disrespectful and uncooperative desk clerk I have ever had,"I had prebooked with Am Ex for a room at this hotel as it was close to my daughters apartment and wanted to stay in a nice hotel. After long train ride, arrived and the desk clerk said when I went to check in , my reservation had been cancelled. As was prepaid, asked ""what"" and by who? He shrugged and just said bad card. He did not offer any other info or assistance and indicated for me to move aside. Luckily I had cell phone to call Am Ex. I sat and watched him casually talk to them and not rush to answer phone or when they had told me they were faxing new info , he waited to go get it. Finally checked us in after 25minutes but no comments , sorry for this or anything..just rudely handed the forms then gave us key. The rooms are nice and modern and clean and after shower went‚Ä¶"
 August 2010,3,Not bad...a bit old...noisy part of city,This is the old Sofitel. The staff is friendly and helpful. The concierge speaks English very well and the rest do fine. The new Sofitel is much better but much more expensive. Another good option in Rabat is the Villa Mandarine
 March 2011,4,"Confirbale hotel, great for business trip","I stayed three two nights here last March 2011. The hotel is clean , good refurbished and very conveninet for a business trip. Intener works quite fine and people both at the restaurant and at the front desk are nice and helpful and can speak a good english , something not very common in Rabat. The restaurant and breakfast are quiet expensive but the quality os good. In adition , it is walking distance from the main atractions in RAbat, like the Medina and the Hassam Tower so deinfitely is a good option to combine business and leasure."
 December 2010,3,Expected much more from a top Mercure.,Good food at the Brasserie. The hotel is not within a walking distance from the train station. Lots of smokers...
 November 2010,3,"Dont get a room above the Bar, no matter what floor","I stay here on a regular basis, however my stay was not to its usual level that I expect. On the final night, I was in a room that was 3 floors directly above the band on the mezzanine level. I was unable to get to sleep that evening until the band finished, and given I had an early flight out in the morning I needed to get up quite early. The band was so loud they restricted my capacity to sleep and at times it felt like they were in my living room. I do not object to bands or noise, but given this noise travelled through 3 levels with limited reduction in the noise volume, management should consider advising guests on check in that if they have a room directly above the band that as a paying customer you are informed of potential noise, and given an option upon checking in‚Ä¶"
 November 2009,5,Warm Friendly and Kind,"The only down side was that parking was a little difficult due to the location, the Hotel it self was excellent, even after falling ill due to take out meals the staff relay took care of me , Thank you Lamya , hope you all the best in your New Job , Shokran Bizz aff"
 August 2010,2,No air conditioning - great if you like sleeping in a sauna,"While the staff were very friendly and the rooms were clean, there was absolutely no air conditioning the entire stay. The thermostat in the room did nothing but start and stop a fan that did nothing. I repeatedly asked about the air conditioning, and the staff repeatedly told me that ""there is a problem with it,"" but offered no timeline when it would be fixed during our two week stay. Hotel management did not seem to be concerned about it. I woke up repeatedly in the middle of the night soaked in sweat; it was pure misery. If you like saunas and being sleep deprived, this is the hotel for you. Additionally, you are better off using carrier pigeons than trying to suffer through the ""free Internet"" that is offered here. The speeds varied from 0.5k to 1kbps. You're better‚Ä¶"
 August 2010,5,White palace near the top of a hill,"We chugged up the hotel from the train station, We were Marrakech refugees, our hands filled with little plastic bags from a series of souvenir shopping sprees (little did we know that we should have waited until Granada where the prices are better and the shopping experience less stressful). We had no hotel in Rabat, and the info desk guy at the train station was singularly unhelpful. So when we brushed the sweat from our eyes and saw the Diwan gleaming at the top of a hill, we realized we probably wouldn't get any closer to hotel paradise in Morocco. THe Diwan is a business-oriented hotel, so expect the usual western amenities (including Internet and mag-striped door openers instead of clunky keys) and service. There's a restaurant on site and a spa, which I would have‚Ä¶"
 July 2010,3,Welcoming and clean,"Good hotel, few minutes walking from the Medina. It has a free wireless connection in each room. The staff is kind but most of them do not speak English (including some one working at the reception (!!). Always clean and welcoming, it has only one cons: it has no gym and no pool. The food at the restaurant is decent and safe. Take into consideration flying to and from Casablanca instead Rabat Sal√® airport because the flights to and from Casablanca are quite frequent going almost wherever and it takes less than 1 hour by taxi from Rabat city center (and it coss only 600MAD = 60 euros)."
 June 2010,5,much more than my expectation,"The Hotel Diwan is an exemplary example of a luxurious hotel for business travelers, tourists and locals alike.On the day of the review,great service was already evident, it came in the form of helpful and friendly staff,Although I had a comfortable stay, the interior of Hotel Nikko and its rooms seemed terrific , i will come back for sur ."
 June 2010,5,highly recommended hotel . great value,"it's by far one of the best business hotel in rabat. I particularly liked the service and the Bistro is one of the best i ve ever seen, the food was awesome, the wine also. The sales manager was very friendly and always there to help me and my colleagues."
 December 2007,4,Met our expectations and served our needs,"Rabat is less visited than other Moroccan cities, but has an interesting & bustling mix of Medina, old Fort, Atlantic coast and North African street life. Pleasant compared to Casablanca and more modern and better laid out than Marrakesh, Rabat is worth a visit and the Sofitel Diwan Rabat is a decent place to base yourself to spend a few days here. Remeber you're in Morocco - if you arrive uptight then certain elements of the hotel (and the country) will not meet your expectations. So relax, wander, enjoy."
 April 2009,3,Average Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel a few months ago and would consider it as an average place for its rating. although it offers all facilities, the service was within the standards but not excellent. Location was not convenient."
 June 2009,4,Pleasant Experience,"Room was clean, inhouse restaurant food was excellent. Three small points, the business centre could have a printer available and the room window seals were worn, so road noise was slightly annoying, but I tuned out. No ironing facilities in room, so this again costs. When they say it will take 10 minutes it took 45 minutes. Staff are pleasant."
 April 2009,4,Welcomed luxury after cosy riads,"We travelled from Marrakech to Merzouga, Fez, Essaouira, Chefchaouen then finally Rabat. The decision to stay in a modern comfortable hotel was a welcomed change from the adventures of locating riads and carrying luggages up flights of stairs. Although we liked the riads, Le Diwan was definitely a good ending point for 3 weeks spent on the road. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. Staff was efficient and polite. Our only grouse was that there was no wifi in the room although there was internet cable at the desk (we had 2 laptops). The hotel was within walking distance from the city centre (5-8min) and medina (10-15min). We didn't try the breakfast as it was too expensive but had room service twice. Food was good and service prompt."
 November 2008,1,Stay far far away,"I booked a suite for two nights. First they had no record of my reservation and said they informed Expedia that the hotel was full which Expedia said there is no record of any such message sent. When expedia asked for a copy of the communication that said that the hotel could not provide it. I then was given a suite but told that I would have to move after one night. The room was dingy, the phone did not work, the bathtub got clogged after showering, the pressure in the toilet was not great and had to be flushed a few times after use. They did arrange at Expedia insistence and found me a hotel the next day for the other night--but truthfully I was really glad to leave. This place is really really terrible. PondiRoad New York"
 October 2008,5,Great city centre hotel,"I have recently returned from a business trip to Rabat and stayed at the Sofitel Diwan for 2 nights - incidentally it should have been 3 nights but when I arrived at the hotel from the airport I found they had double booked me, I haven't yet discovered if this was a mistake on the hotels part or the agency I booked with, however the hotel found us other accomodation for the night and provided a shuttle bus to drop us there... the alternative hotel was horrendous - the Chellah hotel - classed as 4 star - personally I don't think it deserved even 2 stars!! The room was very shabby and the bathroom was nothing short of disgusting, not to mention the staff were incredibly rude and every drink you seemed to order they got wrong and brought a black coffee instead!!! However given I‚Ä¶"
 June 2007,5,Luxury in Morocco,"We stayed at the Sofitel - Rabat for one night during or self-guided visit to Morocco. As we were traveling with two teenage children, we had checked out several of the other Rabat lodging options (including those reviewed on this site) and decided to splurge a little for the luxury of feeling comfortable in a very foreign land. We're really glad we did! The hotel is a beautiful property well situated to the train station and the Medina - perhaps a 15 minute walk from each. They didn't have a room the could accomodate all four of us, so we had to book two rooms, but both were clean and well appointed. (One with a double bed, one with two twin beds.) The hotel staff was friendly and eager to please, and spoke English with ease - another reason why this seemed like a good‚Ä¶"
 May 2008,5,"Great Hotel, Exceeded Expectations","We stayed at this hotel for one night as part of a guided tour of Morocco. The hotel was terrific and exceeded my expectations of a four star hotel in Morocco. The building was clean, modern, and well designed, and the breakfast selection was fantastic. The hotel is also well located for individuals interested in seeing the main sites (the Chella necropolis, the kasbah, and la tour Hassan and Mausoleum). The rooms were spacious, spotless, and well maintained; the beds were comfortable, there was air conditioning, and there was hot water with good water pressure in the shower. The room also had all the amenities most tourists could want, including a gorgeous bathtub, bathrobes, slippers, etc. Of course, one would expect good things from the hotel, considering the high room‚Ä¶"
 December 2007,4,Good quality modern hotel,"This is a high quality, modern business hotel. A bit small and the breakfast is nothing spectacular, but it is very comfortable with good phones, Internet access and all the conveniences and that is no small feat in Morocco."
 August 2006,5,More than expected!,"Before visiting rabat I had read some reviews on moroccan hotels that a 4 star hotel may be more like a 3 star, but after staying at the Sofitel in Rabat, this is not true for atleast this hotel. It meets the standards of a well established 4 star hotel, From the exterior to the lobby to the rooms, everything is nicely finished. The staff are friendly and are always willing to help out. Its also in a very good location and good restaurants are nearby. If you're with a family of young children, you can ask for a communicating room (a door in between two rooms in the hotel) if you havnt already been given it. It was new to me and I found that it was very handy indeed!"
 March 2006,2,Plain hotel - not much charm,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 days in a junior suite. Okey, this is not a Four Seasons Hotel, but I was kinda dissappointed...This hotel lacks charm and could rather be a airporthotel in Paris than a top end hotel in Morocco. The location is good, and the hotel is new. But that's it. The staff don't seem to interested in their work. As my luggage was delayed, caused by Air France, I gave some important documents to one of the employees. And what happened? He lost my documents...and the hotel didn't even seem to care. He didn't even give me an apology. Only told me that he'd lost the documents. That's not proper for a Sofitel hotel. The staff was rather cold and reserved. I never saw them smile. I felt I was asking for a big favor every time I had to ask something from the‚Ä¶"
 April 2005,5,Fabulous!,"We stayed here for about 10 days and the service was absolutely superb throughout, along with super-friendly and attentive staff. The modern hotel offers a brilliant base for exploring the city. Loved the hammam experience and would definitely stay there again. 10 out of 10."
 September 2005,4,It was quite OK.,"I stayed in this hotel for a couple of days for my business trip to Rabat. I agree that this doesn't have any special local touch to mention. It isn't so gorgeously delux hotel, either. But it satisfies all usual hotel standards, with clean room and service. The staff responded to all my small requests quickly enough. As a business visitor, I was quite satisfied with the hotel. The restaurant on the ground floor was nice, too."
