 December 2022,5,Excellent bar experience,"Amazing bar service by hamza , super friendly team and cocktails we had much fun me and my team a night out in the hotel Beautiful architecture that makes you feel in a James Bond movie in africa I would highly recommend for at least one cocktail"
 November 2022,5,Great Hotel,"We spent are first night in Morocco at this lovely hotel. It is well situated. The staff was very helpful especially Abdellatif Lotfi rooms operations manager. He went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our room. The room was large, well appointed and comfortable. Thank you Abdellatif."
 September 2022,5,Excellent,"Though only staying for one night La Tour Hassan Palace was a very pleasant place to be. Good sized bedroom and bathroom overlooking the pool. Very well maintained, the whole place oozed quality. Hotel a mix of the traditional and the modern. The area around the pool offered shade from the hot sun and good quality bar meals were available here. Breakfast offers a large choice and is also taken by the pool. The staff at all times were extremely good, pleasant and efficient. Very highly recommended."
 October 2022,3,Disappointed in service.,"Lovely hotel but lacking in service. At the pool in afternoon. Everyone standing around. No one came to offer service. Finally went up to bar to request service. Told someone would be out. No one came. Once again went to bar, ordered. Took 45 minutes to receive 2 drinks! Made reservation for a car pickup to go to,a restaurant. Never e arrived. After 30 minutes got a taxi from street. Manager never available during those times."
 September 2022,5,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel is very impressive. I would say it‚Äôs more on the scale to a higher end hotel. From check in to check out everything was just perfect. The staff were wonderful. It was my birthday and they surprised me by brining a cake to our room. That was the most sweetest, kindest and thoughtful thing someone could do. I really appreciated that and thank you to all of you at the Hassan Palace. Our room was so beautiful and comfortable. The breakfast was really good. You‚Äôre made to feel that it was all especially prepared for you. The pool was nice but water was very cold. We also experienced our first hamman here and it was really the best. The hotel is close to town and walking distance to the Medina."
 September 2022,5,great service,"A wonderful hotel. We spent two nights there . Great service, wonderful assortment for breakfast, comfortable room spacious and clean, easy access to major sights and restaurants. Highly recommend. Beautiful garden."
 July 2022,5,We Felt Like Kings here!,"LOVELY hotel! This was our ""splurge"" while in Morocco, but it was well worth it. Lovely staff, lobby, pool area, etc. The rooms are clean, but a bit small. However, the service was impeccable. Every night there was a knock on the door to see if we needed anything. If we didn't, they handed us chocolates :) Would highly recommend!"
 July 2022,5,"3 nights, great experience all around, beautiful hotel with good service","We stayed here for three nights during the summer and had a wonderful experience. The staff was all very friendly, and fluent in English / French / Moroccan Arabic. Any small or minor issue that came up was resolved quickly. Breakfast is incredible -- good mix of Moroccan-style breakfast foods and more ""western"" style foods. The ""gym"" is about what you'd expect from a hotel gym, but unfortunately only one of the treadmills was working so had to wait a little while to jog. The free weights and machines were well maintained. Room was comfortable and had a nice view of the interior courtyard. Room service takes about 45 minutes and seems to come from the restaurants (very wide variety of food, and very high quality). Location is excellent -- you can walk from the train station‚Ä¶"
 July 2022,5,Wonderful hotel in central Rabat,"Highly recommended! Our family enjoyed staying at the Tour Hassan Palace Hotel for a week. Our room was spacious, quiet and clean with a lovely view of the courtyard and pool. Breakfast was a generous buffet of fresh juices and fruits, breads and pastries and custom-cooked egg dishes and crepes as well as hot and cold traditional Moroccan food. We ate dinner there several evenings and the food was wonderful. Staff were attentive and helpful arranging taxis. Location is good, in walking distance of the old waterfront area and markets as well as the Tour Hassan itself. We would be happy to return."
 July 2022,5,Sweet beautiful and cool place,"As pilot flying to Rabat I‚Äôm used to come to La tour Hassan hotel. It‚Äôs always a great pleasure to come here. Always a warm welcome and I feel like home. Service is warm and welcoming in every part of the hotel. It‚Äôs very clean, rooms are calm and the food is great. Small but beautiful spa. No way to go elsewhere üôÜ"
 July 2022,5,"The hospitality of monsieur Mohamed in the epicurien restaurant made us enjoy our lunch, perfection .","Had a lunch in the epicurien restaurant , and it was amazing , so pleased about the hospitality and the joyful conversation of the mettre of the restaurant monsieur Mohamed that made us enjoying our lunch and the food was very delicious food a bit expensive but it worth it , very charming table next to the pool with a nice view of the garden , nice experience"
 June 2022,5,Fit for a king ... and the royal treatment even for us,"This hotel was lovely from start to finish. Every staff member we met was helpful, friendly. They arranged cars for us. Made recommendations. Once we had eaten in the hotel restaurant (DELICIOUS) a couple tunes they started making suggestions and one might even brought some special menu items as they prepare to bring back (since Covid) more dining options in July. The food was amazing. Good presentation. Delicious and creative and interesting. Food Service a little slow for our American personalities but I think this was also due to just scaling back up now from Covid cutbacks. The breakfast buffet!!! So good"
 June 2022,5,Appreciation,"This hotel is such an amazing place to be. You just can't miss it. I dearly encourage guests and tourists to make this beautiful and warm receptive hotel their home. The Moroccan food is just too tasteful and satisfying. Special gratitude to Dalal, she is very much resourceful, kind and helpful. Enjoy the moment in this great hotel of Rabat, the city of life."
 June 2022,4,Special thanks,I want to thank the whole team of the hotel especially the receptionist Najwa and also Dalal who took the trouble to move and meet our needs. Big thanks for you ! We became a loyal guest to La Tour Hassan Palace haha ! Thank you Rabat üíê thank you Morocco
 June 2022,5,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for six nights and enjoyed every moment of its quiet Moroccan charm and excellent service. Conveniently located in downtown Rabat, the hotel combines old-fashioned elegance with modern amenities. Scrumptious and copious breakfast buffets were enjoyed in the lovely garden, and dinners by the pool were enlivened by delightful conversations in English, French, and Franglais with our charming waiter Mohammed Bentaher. The only fault was the enormous and heavy duvet on the otherwise comfortable bed--it was too hot for June!"
 June 2022,5,Refreshing haven after a busy day,"When we first arrived, the hotel had overbooked (supposedly with some part of the Moroccan royal entourage) and they had to rebook us for one night elsewhere. We were so disappointed, but lovely English-speaking manager Ayoub said we could use the breakfasts, the terrace, the pool, and still be a guest, just sleeping a few meters away. By the next morning we were booked into the Tour Hassan Palace for the next couple of nights. We enjoyed its lovely touches, extreme cleanness, gracious setting right next to all the Rabat sights, this place was a haven after busy tourist days! The breakfast buffet and eating area was scrumptious in every way. The best kind of Moroccan hospitality among all the employees, including in the restaurants. This was a splurge for us, and worth it."
 June 2022,5,Love this hotel!!!,"I have stayed here several times and every time is perfect. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, and always very clean. Younes and Najwa are always incredibly welcoming and helpful. If you ever stay in Rabat, I definitely recommend this hotel. It‚Äôs within walking distance of great and affordable restaurants as well as the Medina and other places to go sight seeing."
 May 2022,1,Overrated and bad service,"We booked 4 deluxe rooms.When arriving hotel we were the only guest but still check in took 20 minutes. The rooms were nice but could be in better condition including cleaning. Only 1 small water bottle( very unusual for Morocco) No coffee ,no Tea( cattle and coffee maker were in the room)When I asked for coffee or tea and water, I was told that this is on extra charge. No shower cap,no laundry bag ,no pencil. Next morning next unpleasant meeting.It took us about 40 minutes and around 12 requests to receive coffee and tea.For the bread someone ales got angry and not me.The same for receiving a Yogurt or a spoon. When we asked to complain and to receive a compensation only after our persistence and not relinquish they sad we could have dinner on there account in the hotel.We‚Ä¶"
 May 2022,5,Where history and present meet,This hotel is a generous helping of Moroccon hospitality. It clearly is the choice of stay for statesmen and celebrities and it is clear why. Space and cleanliness internally and then gardens of paradise outside. Good food selection. Not the cheapest by far in Rabat but you are paying for history and class.
 May 2022,5,LUXURY RABAT PALACE,"This is an excellent, luxury hotel in the heart off Rabat. It boasts Rabat's best restaurant, with magical Tajines to tempt the palate. Comfortable rooms with massive king-sized beds. Good free WiFi. Nice helpful staff. Lovely gardens and pool. No wonder this hotel has played host to international stars and celebrities."
 June 2021,1,disapproval,The amount of cultural appropriation in this hotel is unbelievable. All the pictures and paintings on the walls belong to Algeria. women in photos were wearing Algerian Traditional Attires yet they were claimed to be Moroccan this made me question everything I have seen in Morocco.
 December 2021,1,M√©diocre,"We are an Algerian couple we stayed at this hotel last April to visit our friends the problem we encountered is The amount of cultural appropriation at this hotel is unbelievable. All photos and paintings on the walls belong to Algeria. the women in the photos were wearing traditional Algerian outfits but they were claimed to be Moroccan, this made me question everything I have seen in Morocco"
 April 2022,2,"No Air conditioning, Bed was Hard as Rocks","My wife and I arrived on an 80+ degree day and was shocked there was no air conditioning in the hotel. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to sleep in those conditions. We tried to open the window only to be serenaded by barking dogs all night. To make things worse the bed was very hard and was not at all comfortable. So needless to say we didn‚Äôt get any sleep when we were there. Stay away, especially in the summer."
 April 2022,5,Hotel Rabat,"We stayed at the Tour Hassan Palace for 3 nights before starting our tour of Morocco. It was wonderful. Located right in the heart of the City. The staff was very attentive, went above and beyond to provide the information and services we needed. The accommodations were wonderful, the breakfast perfect and the evening meal to break the fast was fantastic! We scheduled massages; they were wonderful and the grounds were manicured to perfection. I would highly recommend!"
 February 2022,4,Very Nice Hotel with One Issuet,"My wife and I spent two nights at La Tour Hassan at the end of February 2022. Overall, it was a nice stay with only one issue. As I understood the history of the hotel, it was built in 1915 and has been renovated several times. Presently, the hotel is very modern but retains its original geometric decorations. The present main entrance is at ground level (-1 on the elevator). The original entrance can be seen and is quite ornate, but involved quite a number of steps, which is a problem for disabled access. The neighborhood appears to be safe. We walked around the neighborhood and never felt unsafe. The staff has been excellent ‚Äì they are polite and ready to help. All the staff that I had interaction with spoke good English. Our room was adequately large. It had a‚Ä¶"
 February 2022,5,A. FDIL,"We had the most wonderful time at the hotel. You feel good from the moment you arrive. The receptionists are very professional and above all friendly. Very good gastronomy; you risk getting fat by eating well;) ;)... Smiling, helpful, attentive, calm, etc."
 June 2021,4,Gym Needs an Overhaul,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 weeks on a business trip. Staff were friendly and helpful, great location near the bazaar and river, with lots of good bars and restaurants nearby. Rooms were spacious and clean, the toiletries were excellent, all argan based. Wifi is strong and stable. We would have given it a 5 star if it wasn‚Äôt for the gym which was a big disappointment. Most of the machines don‚Äôt work, if they do, they‚Äôre grimy. There are no towels, water nor sanitizers to wipe up before or after use. The mats were smelly and dirty. The machines are stained and grimy. It‚Äôs such a shame because the view from the gym is overlooking the pool which was beautiful. We hope they improve this area."
 May 2021,5,Excellent Property,We are staying at Tour Hassan Palace as a group for the past 10 days. I can only say the hotel and staff have been excellent. Given the current situation they have gone the extra mile to ensure our visit is of the highest quality. The rooms are comfortable and all amenities are of a high standard. Housekeeping always do a great job and make sure the room is clean and tidy. The restaurant and Bar staff are most accommodating to our needs and we enjoy a very nice breakfast daily with plenty of variety. Overall I would recommend this property and look forward to returning
 May 2021,5,Wonderful stay.,"I would like to thank for such a wonderful stay in this lovely resort . Spacious and clean room , nice pool and lovely garden where you can enjoy your meal or just have a relaxing day . Absolutely lovely and attentive staff especially Mr.Nabil and Mr. B.Mohamed . Look forward for another visit."
 April 2021,2,"The good, the bad, but mostly the ugly...","Stay in this hotel left us with a very bad aftertaste about the city of Rabat, which they represent for tourist coming for one night to stay. Unfortunately the management does not seem to understand this simple fact. Because of this experience I will recommend to avid Rabat to everyone who will ask. The hotel is well maintained and the rooms are fairly comfortable. What tipped us off was the food. Their restaurant is probably the worst one we had in Morocco. Incredible bland and uninspiring. There was not a single item, out of 6 we tried, we liked. All tagines hand exactly the same taste - unseasoned. The way they treated us with respect to breakfast was simply disguising. At the check in we were informed that the breakfast buffet starts at 7:30. We showed up at 8 to find‚Ä¶"
 April 2021,5,Morrocan Bath with Meryem is the best!,"As I came many times in Morocco i did morrocan bath quite often but I didnt know the real one till i met Meryem! She s just the best! I couldnt enjoy it more than this!ill come back for her, definitely! Shukran!"
 October 2020,5,Amazing Experience,"I feel that its mandatory to review this place. They respected all the measures of COVID-19, that I was afraid of. It was an amazing experience, and I am happy to discover such a wonderful hotel. Thank you for your hospitality and professionalism."
 February 2020,4,"Lovely hotel and grounds, great staff","This hotel is great. Large comfortable rooms, beautiful courtyard and garden. The breakfast is simply amazing. Staff wonderful, as are all service industry people in Morocco so far. Only reason not five stars is, as others have mentioned, it was not possible to turn on the air conditioning in February but it was quite warm. There is a very large window which can be opened, and that cools the room, but then the outside noises come in. Which were minimal and included nice music. At the next update it would be good if the guest could choose whether they want heat or air or neither. The outdoor bar was delightful. I wandered to it by mistake so not sure which floor it is on. Up at least a level from the courtyard and main restaurant. Overall, highly recommended property‚Ä¶"
 February 2020,4,Great Hotel in Rabat!,Our group stayed here for one night. Beautiful lobby and bar. The room wasn‚Äôt as Impressive. Great breakfast included with the room. Great selection of both hot and cold items. Delicious pastries too!
 January 2020,5,Beautiful hotel - everyone was very helpful,"This hotel is very nice. Many pros and only a few cons. The room (221) was nice and faced a courtyard. The room was a little warm, and once I realized that both the AC and Heat settings on the thermostat blew warm air, I turned it off. BIG window along the wall facing the courtyard, and that stayed open most of my stay. The room was well appointed. There was a plate of cookies and bottled water upon arrival. Our group ate at two of the restaurants, La Maison Arabe and L'Epicurien. We had breakfast included which was served in the Imperial restaurant. All the food was very good and well priced (i.e. relatively inexpensive for a hotel restaurant). The breakfast buffet was very good and very broad. Fresh fruit was wonderful and the fresh juices were a great way to start the‚Ä¶"
 November 2019,4,GOOD BUT !,Very popular long standing hotel in a Spanish style with a attentive staff. Large rooms with several quirks. The AC and heat cannot be run at the same time. One or the other is activated at different times of the year. The tub shower with a half glass is very high with NO safety grab bars to help getting in or out. The speed buttons on the phone did not work and we found it hard to reach the front desk. You have to dial a direct number which was not posted by the phone. Recommend. Hope this helps.
 September 2019,5,Beautiful Hotel,"What a great hotel. The room was just lovely and staff so helpful and friendly. Really enjoyed my stay there and would definitely recommend. The food in the Moroccan restaurant was superb, the best dining experience I had in Morocco"
 November 2019,4,"Beautiful hotel, Great location","This was our first stay during our 2 weeks in Morocco. The hotel lobby is absolutely beautiful-ornate tile work and comfortable seating areas. Dates and fresh fruit always available. The waterfall outside was eye catching. The pool area and grounds were very nice. Our first room was very stuffy, so we opened the window. The room backed up to the kitchen so we immediately heard all the kitchen noise. The cooking odors quickly permeated the whole room. Plus the electronic safe didn't work. We were able to change rooms to one overlooking the pool area. It was so much better-quieter and without the cooking smells...and the safe worked! The bath amenities were really nice and fragrant. There was a plate of yummy cookies and a plate of fruit plus bottled water. The‚Ä¶"
 November 2019,3,"Beautiful public areas, room tiny and overpriced","Room, clean and comfy but very small for 2. Unable to walk around bed if desk being used. High supplement for double occupancy. Had to ask for more towels, glasses etc as only set up for one. Never did get an extra cup! Tea and coffee making facilities: 2 coffee pods for whole weeks stay and no teabags (available at cost). Never in 40 years of world travel have I ever stayed in a hotel, Riad, bed and breakfast or apartment and been charged for tea bags. A few hours late checkout, charged at 50% of room rate. Breakfast cost ¬£25, cafe close by was ¬£2.50 (fresh juice, eggs, olives, bread, tea or coffee). Charged extra ¬£50 on final bill, reception staff somewhat miffed when we noticed. Will go elsewhere on our next visit to Rabat."
 November 2019,5,"Excellent, Clean Hotel","This is an excellent hotel, with excellent service. I was here only one night, but it was a pleasant stay. The room was quiet, large and clean, the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was large and clean. I would stay here again."
 April 2019,4,Re: Lovely hotel,"A Lovely comfortable room. Enjoyable breakfast, filling and had a nice Moroccan feel. Stunning pool area.... Didn't get to use the pool but the view from the room was beautiful, and walking in the area was relaxing. Hotel was well situated, and I enjoyed walking in the area around the hotel."
 April 2019,5,Beautiful,"Every year I visit I am impressed with the experience. Hotel smells nice, looks nice and is very comfortable. I look forward to the Spa every year. The warm reception at the door is always something I can count on."
 May 2019,4,Good location. Nice hotel. Room could have been larger. Mattress needed to be flipped over.,Hotel is nice but my room could have been larger and was a bit dated. Mattress needed to be flipped over as there were hollows on each side of the bed. Nice breakfast buffet. Staff members are overall nice and professional.
 March 2019,5,Perfect experience and location,"Great hotel, and staff. True Moroccan experience. Service was exceptional. Garden and pool wonderful. Right in the center of town easy to get around to many cool places. I have to say the food was very good. The overall experience was very relaxed and charming."
 March 2019,5,Luxurious hotel at reasonable price,We really enjoyed our brief stay at this hotel. It was centrally located within walking distance of the major sites in Rabat. There were many restaurant options within walking distance as well. We also had a great time at the spa with a luxurious hammam.
 April 2019,5,Excellent hotel in Rabat,Close to old city and wonderful service and restaurants. I strongly recommend this hotel for a short or long stay. I would be happy to stay there again. I am a regular global business traveler and La Tour Hassan sets a high standard.
 October 2019,4,THE BEST PART OF THE HOTEL WAS ITS STAFF,"Good food and good location. I was able to walk to the main boulevard as well as the Kasbah but the real test came when my wife discovered, on Day 1, that she needed batteries for her electric tooth brush. After explaining what I needed and the size, one of the desk clerks ask for some money and volunteered to go get them for me. When he returned, he called my room and I came down and got them and my change. The batteries turned out to be about half of what I would have paid in the U.S. Clerk then refused a tip. I cannot imagine getting this kind of service in any major city hotel in the U.S. We would definitely stay there again should the opportunity to do so present itself."
 October 2019,4,"Solid place, central location","La Tour Hassan is a nice large hotel with all the amenities you would expect of a four-star hotel. (They are not quite a five-star hotel, in my opinion, but they are still good.) The interior has a lot of Moroccan charm, and there are nooks and crannies throughout the place to sit and enjoy a tea and conversation. The outdoor area is lovely and the restaurant (Maison Arabe) on-site is quite nice. Breakfast is varied with fresh options as well as many pastries and hot dishes. The wait staff is friendly, attentive, and aims to please. The front desk is also amiable and does its best to make guests happy. There's a small ""business center"" with a couple computers and a printer. And the location is very near to the medina and other things you might want to see in Rabat. We used‚Ä¶"
 October 2019,5,Beautiful interior,The hotel is historic and full of beautiful tile as one would hope to find in Morocco. There is a large and beautiful inner courtyard with a nice pool. Our room was huge. Everyone was friendly. The hotel is in the center of town.
 November 2019,5,2019 Morocco Rabat lodging,We arrived from Paris and our group were provided a bus for transportation to the hotel. Weather was very good. Good to bring some light extra layers of clothes as the evenings mat be a little cooler than the days. The staff quickly checked us into our rooms for a welcome rest.
 November 2019,5,Exquisite hotel,"Really enjoyed my stay here. We were there for a night in November, Rooms definitely have a luxurious feel, and the location is perfect if you‚Äôre willing to visit Rabat. An Amazing rooftop and exceptional jazz bar with live music show, the service was exceptional , the quality of food specially the breakfast was stoning, I tried the Moroccan soup Harira and a special oil called ARGAN oil, and a special almond butter called Amelou , it was amazing and very tasty, although it was raining this morning but people made feel so welcome Thank you"
 October 2019,5,Absolutly Exeptional !!!,"The Tour Hassan Palace in Rabat is absolutely Exceptional! What a destination. Honestly the service the cleanliness the staff absolutely everything was perfect. This was our Our second stay at this hotel this year, we came in on the 27 October and left on the 1st November. It was even better than the first. Upgraded to a beautiful suite, all the staff were friendly and helpful especially at breakfast where we had the best breakfast ever in Morocco, the pool staff was amzing, and the Moroccan restaurant was so delicious that we decided to have diner twice in our stay. Thank you hope will come back on january"
 October 2019,5,the best we‚Äôve stayed in in all of Morocco.,"This was an amazing stay in, we were there with travl link for two nights, people were very nice, the breakfast was wonderfull, with a huge choice of vienoiserie, salads, eggs and some moroccan pastries , the waiters were very attentive, rooms were very clean, and the sight on the garden was just wonderfull, thank you again, hope will stay there another time"
 October 2019,4,"Rabat, Morocco","The hotel is in a prime location close to lots of restaurants, the Medina, downtown, grocery store, historic sites, etc. Rooms are clean but small. Very nice garden, lots of coaches/chairs to sit, relax, and enjoy a meal. Nice small gym but no air conditioner; they need to have sanitizer to clean the equipment before and after use by guest. The concierge should have a basic understanding of English. Morocco is a beautiful country and lots of tourists visit. This is supposedly a five star hotel and the staff should have an average knowledge of English."
 September 2019,5,"Outstanding Location, Excellent Hotel","We were part of a tour group that spent two nights at the La Tour Hassan Palace. This is a superior hotel and well-located in the heart of Rabat. The accommodations were very nice. The hotel features a beautiful courtyard with gardens and a pool that invite the visitor to relax and enjoy the hotel. It was quiet with very good service. Our luggage was misplaced on our arrival, but the staff immediately started a search and found our luggage quickly (it had been mislabeled by the tour company). The hotel restaurant provided us with a buffet that satisfied everyone's appetite. The breakfast bar was well supplied with fruits, pastries, cereals, eggs, meat, cheese, etc. I recommend La Tour Hassan Palace as a place to stay in Rabat."
 June 2019,2,Staff needs to be polite and undertanding,"Hotel ambiance, food is excellent. Room size is very average. The most negative part of this hotel is the staff, all are not very verse of English. On reception the staff is not very friendly and not giving a good welcome. They keep you standing while they are busy in their own world, neither they ask the customer to take a seat, until you don't intervene you will have to keep waiting. Room service is also very poor as they take their own good time to respond to your query or request that is made."
 September 2019,5,Perfection!,"A truly magnificent hotel with service to match. Every action by the staff is geared toward the comfort of the quest. We booked a massage for my husband and I upon arriving. The spa was well appointed, meticulous clean and tidy. The therapist were obviously highly trained. The pool area was gorgeous, not a leaf out of place! The hotel was built in 1912 and has many renovations so it is modern but has not lost the luxury of the original intent of the hotel. You get the ultimate service of bygone days in a beautiful up to date hotel. We would not hesitate to stay again. Many thanks for our wonderful experience"
 August 2019,5,Luxurious Boutique Palace in the city.,"Located in the heart of the city within walking distance to many tourist sites. Elegant and refined in every detail, yet inviting and warm. The friendly welcome by M Taoufig, and M Soufiane was appreciated, and their english skills were impressive. My room was ready and check in was efficient and quick. My room 219 exceeded all expectations, air conditioning, free WiFi,and delicious Moroccan sweets. Breakfast even had Scotch smoked salmon, and fresh squeezed juices every day. The public areas are gorgeous with beautiful mosaics and a large courtyard, and of course a lovely swimming pool. The hotel and staff exceeded all expectations, and I look forward to returning next year."
 April 2019,4,Beautiful hotel in a walkable area,"Stayed 2 nights while touring Morocco and had a very pleasant experience. The room was very clean and well kept, the food in the restaurant was okay, the front desk staff were helpful and the breakfast buffet had a wide variety of offerings. We walked from the hotel to the medina in a short period of time, returning at night, and felt very safe. Two words of caution: 1) don't accept a room on the lower floors if you're unable to walk up and down stairs - they do have an elevator but some rooms still require you to take stairs further down. 2) Count your money at the desk when exchanging!"
 August 2019,5,Lovely stay,"Today was our last day at La Tour Hassan Palace hotel after a one week stay for business. Also had my husband and nine year old daughter with me on this trip. Room was sparkling clean and the housekeeping staff were exceptional. The hotel itself was very pleasant. The pool was super quiet - my nine year old had it all to herself most afternoons. Room service was excellent and portions sizes were massive. Didn‚Äôt try the restaurants so can‚Äôt comment on that kind of dining experience. Reception staff were extraordinarily helpful. The guy at the cashier‚Äôs desk was very patient when I had a complicated check out (i.e., please charge this to this card and that to that card etc). Younes was phenomenal. He set me up with an awesome driver who took us all over the city and then on to the‚Ä¶"
 July 2019,5,The best hotel in Rabat,I am satisfied with the impeccable services of the hotel. The food variety and test are excellent. The room is excellent. I really thank everyone for making my stay amazing. not only the hotel service is perfect but its location is also. I highly recommend the hotel for others and definitely will stay next time.
 August 2019,5,"Elegant, tranquil, stylish, secure","Stayed at this hotel during a trip to attend a wedding in Rabat. We were originally planning to stay elsewhere and had to change last-minute to here and have no regrets whatsoever. The various restaurants have all been good; the breakfast buffet in the l‚ÄôImperial is opulent and delicious. The staff are always eager to be helpful. The Moroccan restaurant (Maison Arabe) is not to be missed. Easy to get transportation with either a taxi or Careem, and not far from the main places you‚Äôll want to visit in Rabat. The king-sized bed in our suite is comfortable although I personally prefer less puffy pillows. WiFi has been fine (which is a must in Morocco, given the exorbitant rates for international cellular data service). You‚Äôll note a lot of security while visiting this‚Ä¶"
 January 2019,5,My favorite hotel in Rabat,"The hotel is part of the culture of Morocco and Rabat as opposed to a ""chain"" experience. The staff is highly professional, well trained, accommodating and amazingly friendly. The rooms might be smaller, but immaculate and well maintained. Moroccan elegant. Nothing shabby at all. Work out room is not extravagant, but well equipped for the basics and accessible with a nice view to the courtyard. Centrally located to business, the train station, the Medina and restaurants, a lot within walking distance. Staff usually recognizes you as a guest going and coming or around the facilities. Really nice touch in personal follow up after a stay from guest relations to make sure everything was satisfactory and keep you coming back."
 June 2019,5,VIP Hotel in Rabat,"Posh, elite, upscale, elegant.THE place to stay in Rabat. Dignitaries coming & going, foreign government officials, heads of state, security details everywhere, dramatic limousine arrivals and departures, quite exciting! We loved our stay so much. Our room had a great view of the gardens, pool, and fountains. The breakfast was just wonderful...excellent service! Live music in the Trendy Bar in the evenings. The new spa just opened...perfect! Would stay again on our next trip to Rabat."
 May 2019,5,Excellent stay! Clean!,"We initially had an Airbnb that was cancelled on us and Airbnb provided us with a credit to use towards any accommodation. We decided to book at La Tour Hassan Palace. I have to say the stay was excellent..partly because we went from a $26/night Airbnb to a $270/night hotel! We were upgraded to the garden view room which had a king bed, and view of the garden. Everything was very clean, sheets were nice and washroom was big. They also had a currency exchange available at good rates(better than Casablanca airport). Staff were friendly and they helped hail a cab for us. WiFi was excellent. Location was decent..about 15 mins walk to the Medina. You can always take a taxi for about 15dh which is like $2. I highly recommend this hotel but would only stay here because our stay was‚Ä¶"
 April 2019,5,Getting value for money,"I stayed at the hotel for a week. Which was very short and very enjoyable. The room was very good though small, nice delicious meals and kind staff. The hotel is placed at a very convenient place a center of many things, tourist places, market, banks, train station ."
 May 2019,2,Too Many Problems for the Price,"When we arrived at the Tour Hassan Palace, we discovered that the advertised parking was on the street, not in a garage. The check in was friendly but it took a long time. When we finally got to the room, the key would not work in the lock. When I tried to call reception, the phone did not work so I had to walk downstairs to get help in locking the door. Then, we decided to eat at the hotel but the restaurants were deserted, perhaps because they were really overpriced. Finally, when I took a bath and my husband took a shower in the newly redecorated bathroom, it flooded. What good is it to have a heated toilet seat and fancy shower jets if the drains don‚Äôt work? The water was so deep that it spilled into the carpeted hallway and the bathroom was unusable. I also could not help‚Ä¶"
 April 2019,5,Very good stay,"Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in Morocco. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the personnel. Once you get in the beautiful mauresque architecture overwhelm us like if we were traveling centuries back in time. The staff was extremely friendly especially M. Houda Bouadya, she was affable and very professional always there when we need her. The hotel have a good emplacement in the city center with some shops nearby where i bought a doudou as a souvenir and the atmosphere there is so special that it really felt like home to me. All respect for all the guest relation staff who does a great job here; a true sample of the Moroccan excellent hospitality!"
 March 2019,4,A taste of elegant Morocco,"We stayed at this very fine hotel in Rabat for the first two nights of our Morocco tour with Gate 1. This is a very upscale hotel in the heart of the city. Upon arrival we were given Moroccan mint tea and some small pastries. We were then assigned our room. The hotel is beautiful with elaborate mosaics on almost all surfaces in the public areas. There is also a large courtyard that is beautifully landscaped with a large pool and wading pool. Rabat is the capital of Morocco and this hotel is near the parliament. Quite a few of the government officials were also staying at the hotel and it was quite interesting to see them all decked out in their robes, turbans, fez's and other garb. I was tempted to take a photo or two but thought it would be a bit too rude. Our room was much‚Ä¶"
 April 2019,5,Excellent service and superb mosaic art all over the compound,"La Tour Hassan Palace is a beautiful hotel that retained stunning mosaic art that Morocco is known, which can be appreciated all over the compound. It is within walking distance to Medina. Service is warm, professional and of high quality. Spa was amazing and the meals including dessert/pastries served at restaurants were excellent!"
 April 2019,4,M. H. Manai,"A charming hotel with high quality of services, nice food and accommodation. The location, near downtown, is well appreciated together with an upgrade to a deluxe room with its nice view on the Andalous garden."
 April 2019,5,Amazing hotel and terrific food at their restaurants.,"A colleague and I stayed there in April 2019 and had an amazing visit. Close to the Old Medina markets. The room was well-appointed; the food at the restaurants terrific. We ate at the Moroccan restaurant (really delightful and not outrageously priced for dinner) and the ""western"" restaurant for lunch. The staff were also flexible with they hit a glitch with my business credit card and arranged by transit to the airport early morning when I left for home. Highly recommend this hotel."
 March 2019,5,Great staff,"Enjoyed stay, good food at breakfast and in restaurant. All the staff were very helpful and attentive especially Houda on Guest Relations who quickly resolved any queries to a satisfactory conclusion."
 April 2019,3,The room is small and a/c was not functioning,"Check-in took quite a long time. Room was so hot and was told to open the window but not ideal because of mosquitoes and other insects. However, Houda is very friendly and helpful because I knew her since she was working at Sofitel Jardin des Roses."
 April 2019,5,Excellent hotel in Rabat,"Staying at this hotel is a pleasure. From check-in to check-out, the service from the staff is efficient and pleasant. The hotel itself is beautiful, and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. Good fitness center, and nice outdoor pool. Excellent breakfast, with again great service."
 April 2019,5,Treated like Royalty,"This hotel lives up to it's name. It is absolutely a Palace with an unbelievable staff that treats each guest like royalty. With every amenity right on the property such as authentic restaurants, bars with live music almost every night, comfortable indoor and outdoor lounge areas, a beautiful pool with fountains, a relaxing spa and massage facility, fitness center, business and conference rooms, Wifi, 24 hour room service, laundry and dry cleaning service, evening turn down service and the most caring, welcoming, and attentive staff I've ever had the pleasure of working with. I thank you again Ms. Houda Bouadya with Guest Relations, as well as the entire staff for treating us like family and making us feel at home. After a three week stay, we were very sad to leave but‚Ä¶"
 February 2019,4,Outstanding hospitality,"I loved my stay here and would like to commend the staff and their dedication. The check in and check out was smooth the room was comfortable as well. Loved the Moroccan sweets kept to welcome us. Their Arabian restaurant is a must go and the food is delicious with live local musicians playing music :). I would especially like to thank Houda Bouadya for being really helpful and giving all the right information to visit the city. She is great and very very helpful. The breakfast is good and provides wide variety, the gym however is small and have limited equipment. Overall, i enjoyed my stay here."
 April 2019,5,Excellent food and top-notch service in the friendly city of Rabat,"We stayed here for a week-long work event in April and the service, food, and friendliness were all something to write home about. The food in Rabat was very good generally, and Moroccan cuisine excellent, but the hotel's buffet breakfast and lunch provided for the event was plentiful in choices across the board, from fresh salads, broad choice of proteins--seafood, fish, meats, poulty--and delicious traditional dishes like couscous. The service was so friendly. Houda Bouadya from Guest Relations helped us with various requests, such as helping to book massage in the city, or the front desk for suggesting good restaurants to try. Rabat felt very safe, and it was a beautiful time of year to visit. The ocean air and breeze permeates the city, which was more green and verdant‚Ä¶"
 March 2019,5,Outstanding Hotel...Outstanding staff,"Spent 4 days for a business trip. This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in. From Check in, to meals, the SPA and the pool area, it was fantastic. I would not stay anywhere else in RABAT. Houda Bouadya of guest relations is absolutely the best!!"
 March 2019,5,Terrace view restaurant,"I took lunch in the quiet & beautiful setting by the pool overlooking the garden, this is the best decision i made since i was in a hurry and only in Rabat for half a day ! so i decided to come experience this hidden gem in the heart of the city. The staff is welcoming and very professional especially Ms. Houda from guest relations who showed me around - in a professional and yet very friendly manner - every corner of the great facilities this hotel has to offer. She even took care of my phone as my battery was dying so i enjoyed my lunch stress free :) I would definitely come back again and hopefully for a longer period of time ! Highly recommanded !"
 March 2019,5,Always Lovely Experience,Wonderful stay great location! This is my second stay at the hotel for my business and leisures travel. Each time is way better than the next! Houda Bouadya of guest relations is absolutely wonderful!
 March 2019,3,Good location but expensive for what you get,The air conditioning didn‚Äôt work. The front desk said open the window. The room was still very hot for sleeping. They advertise A/C in the brochure. It turns out that coffee pods for the coffee maker in the room are only provided for the first night you must pay extra if you stay more than one night. This is after paying $US 360/ night. Service was poor for breakfast but the choices and variety was great.
 March 2019,4,"Lovely hotel, but some problems","The hotel is very impressive, with good size rooms and bath, and great storage. Very clean. Lovely lobby. Helpful staff. Excellent breakfast with great variety. Rooms built around a beautiful courtyard with gardens and a pool in one section of it. The problems were specific to me, but I‚Äôm writing in case they might be applicable to readers. We visited in March, which is a shoulder season in terms of climate. Days are warm enough for shirtsleeves, but at night one needs a jacket. The hotel‚Äôs heating and air conditioning system allows for only heat OR A/C. The heat was on while we were there, which meant that the rooms were uncomfortably warm during the day and even at night they didn‚Äôt cool down unless one left the screenless windows open. There was no way to get the system to‚Ä¶"
 February 2019,5,Beautigul Hotel and well run,The Hotel was a great experience. The mattress was really comfortable and the cushions excellent. WiFi worked well throughout the Hotel. The Food was well prepared and presented. Plenty of storage for clothes and Toiletries. The Housekeeping was good replacing used items from bathroom and capsules for Nespresso machine. Staff were helpful and friendly. Bath was huge and needed ages to fill. I did not understand why it needed to be so deep. I enjoyed my visit. I was part of a Tour Group and we all loved it.
 February 2019,5,Top class service and hosptality,"I have invited my parents to stay at the hotel, they were warmly welcomed and were offered a free upgrade and cake for their wedding anniversary. I definitely recommend this hotel for the impeccable service."
 February 2019,3,First stop in Rabat,"La Tour - the good - a lovely facility in a great location close to the Medina and within walking distance of Chellah and other sites. Rooms are nice and staff is helpful. Wifi is excellent and free. Breakfast buffet is very good. The marginal - air conditioning is a 2 pipe system meaning that you either have heat or a/c so that when we were there in February the hotel was in heat mode so the a/c blew only hot air requiring open windows most of the time. Not surprising for a hotel operating since 1914, but not 4 or 5 star either. Other details were missing like wash cloths, and coffee was sporadic as was bottled water. Unfortunately I have no experience with other hotels in Rabat to compare."
 February 2019,5,Fabulous hotel,"I just spent 4 wonderful nights at this hotel..I was greeted by very friendly helpful staff and Houda, with her lovely smile and friendly attitude. The spacious lobby smelled of roses. My room was large with a couch, 2 chairs, small table, king bed, a safe,Samsung TV and beautiful marble bathroom...I visited the spa for hammam (scrubbing) and massage, a beautiful experience. I had dinner once in the Moroccan restaurant (tagine of chicken and apricots--just delicious..two musicians played oud and drum..it was delightful...two nights I dined in the international restaurant, perfectly prepared lamb chops on one night, duck the next. The wait staff was outstanding all 3 nights...a great thing about this hotel is its proximity to museum of art, soul and Hassan tower. I walked‚Ä¶"
 January 2019,5,Beautiful,"My first time in Morocco, and I was blown away with this beautiful palace hotel. The spa was very relaxing, too bad it was too cold for pool. The Moroccan restaurant had wonderful food, as well as the breakfast buffet. The room was large, well appointed very comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful."
 January 2019,5,Amazing staff!,"I've stayed in La Tour Hassan last week and had a fabulous experience. I was there for work with one of my colleagues and we booked the huge meeting room for the full day for an event of the company we work for. When we arrived the 21st of January, Houda gave us a very warm welcome and showed us our rooms. We even received a free upgrade to a room with a garden view. She showed us the meeting room together with one of the event coordinators. I was very impressed with Houda's fluency in English. The event was very well arranged by the hotel staff and multiple times a day they asked us if we needed anything. So helpful! The breakfast was amazing, fresh juices everyday! 10/10! We will definitely return to this beautiful hotel!"
 January 2019,5,Mr,I am staying here on business trip for a few days. The Hotel is really nice. So far the service is very good. The fitness gym has all I need to keep up on my fitness regime. The Spa is excellent. I will definitely go again before I leave.
 January 2019,5,Excellent,"Second time staying here,service staff, especially the front desk staff, was fantastic. Room was extra clean and well stocked. plenty of pillows and snacks in the room. The restaurants in the hotel are all worth trying and the best part is the short walk to the Medina. Everyone is very friendly and will go out of their way to assist . Will definitely stay here again"
 January 2019,5,Great Hotel Experience,"I was there on business. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times, specially Ms. Houda Bouadya from guest relations, who ensured that everything was perfect right from check-in. The service was excellent and the food was equally good and the staff friendly and helpful. The hotel is centrally located and hence ease to attend business meetings as well as enjoying the sites of Rabat. Definitely worth a return visit, but this time for leisure."
 January 2019,5,Excellence of the service at the SPA,"I received an excellent service, great greeting by the young lady at the service desk and a wonderful massage by souad. Next time I come back to this hotel I will definitely have an other massage session and I highly recommend the spa services. Thank you very much ladies for your sens of high level service."
 December 2018,5,"Gorgeous, great staff, can't wait to go back!","I was there for business and the banquet staff was very attentive, helped us when we had questions or issues and was very hospitable. The hotel is beautiful. So much detail in everything about it. The food was great. The room is a little bit small but not to where it was an inconvenience or anything. The only bad thing is that to me, the weather was warm my first few days but the whole property is on a centralized heating/cooling system and to them, it was winter weather. So my room was a little hot the first couple of days until the weather did cool down. It's within walking distance of many great restaurants as well as the medina where you can do some fun souvenir shopping. It's also within walking distance to the beach and the Oudayas."
 November 2018,5,Perfect Hotel Experience,"The hotel was great and especially Ms.Houda Bouadya from guest relations made my trip more special with her kind and caring treatment. The rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet. Overall I am satisfied with my stay."
 January 2019,5,The best choice!,"A very amazing experience at Tour Hassan Hotel with warm welcomr, top quality services and very nice building in the heart of Rabat. I would definitely recommend this hotel especially for business travellers!"
 January 2019,5,Perfect stay,"Excellent room (very big,comfortable bed and pillows),,great food( tasty and big portions),,friendly staff,location is good ,,room service is fair quick,WIFI very effiecient,the only thing that need to be revised is tv channels where they need to have arabic movies channel"
 January 2019,5,An Amazing Property,"The hotel facilities were so amazing and variable. Also, the staff was so helpful and hospitable. Particularly, the way that their Guest Relation, Houda Bouadya, treated me was so commendable and professional. Eventually, if I am planning to visit Rabat again, La Tour Hassan Hotel will be the idealistic place to stay in."
 November 2018,5,Short but great stay,"I was on a business trip and colleagues made this booking for me. Great location and impressive decor. Don't miss an opportunity to dine in the national restaurant. The staff was very kind and very helpful with information about getting around Rabat, especially Ms. Houda, from the guest relations. Definitely recommending this hotel."
 December 2018,5,Great hotel with exceptional staff,"This month, my wife and I took a vacation to Morocco and our first stop was La Tour Hassan Palace hotel in Rabat.This hotel is located in the center of town and its staff gave us a great welcome. The room was cleaned more than once a day with fresh linen and bottles of water. The reception area was furnished well and its gardens were groomed quite frequently. The hotel has three restaurants and each one offered and served specialty food for every taste. Their customer services were exceptionally professional and friendly. The concierge Ms. Houda Bouadya was a great resource, always available and ready with a recommendation and destination. This hotel gave us a great first experience for our vacation to Morocco. We strongly recommend this hotel when visiting Rabat. DB New York‚Ä¶"
 November 2018,5,Great Hotel,This is a great hotel very good attention from personal. Specially from Houda very helpful on the places that you can visit nearby. This hotel is in the heart of Rabat. There are a lot of tourist places nearby also restaurants train station. Thanks for making my stay very nice
 December 2018,5,Great hotel to stay in while in Rabat,"I travel to Rabat four times a year. This is the only hotel we stay at, Great hotel! The staff are Rock Stars! They are always helpful and very professional. Close to restaurants and shopping. Nice quiet areas to unwind after a day of work, however, there are two bars in the in the hotel to have a drink with friends. The piano bar and the terrace bar"
 December 2018,5,Professional service and lovely staff!,"I must say that I am impressed with a number of things at La Tour Hassan Palace including the professionalism of the staff, the great meeting spaces and amazing restaurants and bars. We organised an event at the hotel a few days ago and the staff took care of every requirement we had, communicated effectively both via email and in person and helped us with every challenge over the course of the two days. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Oumama, the reception and catering staff and, most of all, the lovely concierge Mr Chakir who took care of all my guest arrivals and departures. Thank you for helping us hold a successful event!"
 November 2018,5,Great property check out the waterfall.,"We stayed here on our first night in Rabat. Getting over jet lag here was a great plan. Quiet, close to a place to eat and relaxing garden. Really nice conference area that we used to meet our fellow travelers. Staff very friendly and efficient. Our room was very attractive and the lobby is as attractive."
 November 2018,5,Great hotel to stay at in Rabat,"The hospitality at the La Tour Hassan is fantastic. The staff there, especially Houda Bouadya, is excellent and extremely helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful, covered in mosaics and has a great Moroccan vibe. It is also centrally located so every major site is 5 minutes away. The hotel also has a great Moroccan restaurant where the food is one of the best in the city. Highly recommended"
 November 2018,4,lovely place,"lovely place in the middle of town, all the streets around are being redone the hotel itself if very nice, done in Moroccan style, lots of mosaics, intricate woodwork, lots of marble and tile, and a lot of employees. lovely rooms w most of the amenities you would like=some that are missing: wash cloths, safety bars in the tubs [deep european style], no drying lines for washed clothes to dry there are some language problems-which may lead to some of the service problems one evening we went to restaurant for dinner, only to be taken to 3 of the other restaurants, before they realized that we belonged back where we had started same with certain foods [decaf is a good example] told them a/c didn't work=took them 2 days to inform us that the heat was turned on for the season & we‚Ä¶"
 November 2018,4,Roomy room!,"Nice first and second night stays after arriving in Casablanca, Morocco. Nice roomy room with all the amenities I prefer to have. Clean and comfortable rooms. Place for two suitcases and both of us to easily be able to get in and out of. Wonderful atmosphere. Breakfast was great as well."
 October 2018,3,W,"This hotel, although generally good, should be avoided in the short term as there is constant all day long building work going on directly next door. The piledriving, banging and drilling stop any attempt to relax in your room."
 October 2018,4,Luxury place,Hotel are located in the centre of the city of Rabat designed as a normal traditional style service are great beautiful place had with nice restaurant you can enjoy your new experience with this hotel
 September 2018,4,Perfect location,"I stayed in this hotel a few days ago and I found it to be the best five-star hotel I have been to in Morocco. pros: The hotel is located in the center and it is a few steps away from the old medina. it is elegantly decorated with a fascinating garden and a small swimming pool. It is home to one of the best traditional Moroccan restaurants in Morocco. The food was more than amazing and the staff working at the restaurant ( especially Mr. Ibrahim) were very welcoming and good ambassadors of the hotel. Since I was very happy about the food and the service, I ended up eating all my meals there. Rooms are very neatly furnished, the bed was comfortable, and the room was super quiet with no external noise. Breakfast was rich and the staff at the breakfast room was extremely‚Ä¶"
 September 2018,5,Very good Hotel in Rabat,A 5star hotel in the very center of Rabat. We stayed only for one night and everything was excellent. The room - great. The garden of the hotel - wonderfull. Service - great. Breakfast - delicious! I would highly recommend this hotel if you stay in Rabat!
 October 2018,3,Disappointed!.,"Fifteen years ago I spent my wedding night in the suite of this hotel and thus we decided to book a room for our three nights stay in Rabat (for once we didn't stay with family). I was all excited when I saw that my wife booked the hotel, that brought back good memories!. The room looked ok, modern, with a view on the lovely garden (and the construction work going on behind the hotel (and many other places in the city)). So far no complaints. However there are some things that surprise/ dissappoint(ed), considering how much you pay for a night: - One very small bottle of water for two people!!, when you are advised not to drink/ use the tap water for coffee/tea (in India you get 8 or more, without paying extra). - two cups of Nespresso for the three nights stay??... A simple‚Ä¶"
 April 2018,4,Nice place,"Rooms comfortable. Nice outside area for eating, relaxing, and swimming. On-site restaurant excellent! Area around hotel OK, but a bit concerned about going to Medina at night. Suggest guide or escort. Restaurants often offer this service."
 September 2018,4,Prime Location,Great location in the heart of the city. Good for business travelers. Rooms were clean and modern. Common areas we well maintained. Courtyard was beautiful. Good restaurants and food choices. Would recommend.
 May 2018,3,Pity the Moroccan decor didn't extend to the rooms,It was smallish room that looked out onto a housing estate so it was quiet. I had to have the TV retuned in order to get English tv. The bed was hard so I had to resort to sleeping on pillows. The bedding was 50% / 50% cotton polyester sheets. The Wi-Fi was good so Skype was possible. The hotel provided good sized towels in the bathroom. There was a big safe but it was not attached to cupboard. There was good cupboard space for unpacking. There was no comfy chair to sit on in the room. The breakfast buffet was large with lots of choice including freshly cooked eggs. The hotel was in a good location so most of the sights were within walking distance (the old Medina and fort as well as the Mausoleum). I managed to park on the street just outside the hotel. I decided to change some‚Ä¶
 July 2018,3,Good location,"Hotel is in heart of Rabat close to medina and coast. The hotel is old/historic, not my type. The staff was very friendly and nice, spoke enough English. The AC was terrible and front desk stated they had no fans and would look at AC. The AC still didn‚Äôt work and for the price paid per night is unacceptable to not do anything. The fitness center was nonexistent. They put gym equipment outside on a patio, so you are getting bit by mosquitoes while working out. The breakfast buffet was like 25 Euro and no made to order eggs/omelets. Not worth it. The only thing that saves the hotel is the location and security."
 July 2018,4,"Comfortable, great location","The common areas are large and comfortable. The rooms are somewhat small, but have a very comfortable king sized bed. The breakfast buffet includes a large variety of African and European options, and is very good. It is also in a great location, walking distance to the Medina and Casbah."
 July 2018,5,Moroccoan Style Hotel,"H√¥tel la Tour Hassan Palace is vintage hotel. It has Moroccoan style. Their is Garden with swimming pool. We booked two room which is connected to each of them. It is convenient to family with small kids. Their is nespresso machines but their is no water kettle which innormal to 5 star hotel. Over all the hotel, restaurants and stuffs are excellent."
 June 2018,4,A very good option. Excellent staff,"It is a very nice hotel but it can be even better. The best aspect of the hotel is its staff. Very polite, helpful and with a good command of english. The rooms are comfortable and have the basic amenities. Great room service. Breafkast more than adequate. Location very central. With some extra attention to detail, it can an excellent hotel. I recommend it."
 May 2018,5,Charming Hotel in Old Town Rabat,Have stayed at the Hotel la Tour Hussan on several occasions over the past 10 years. The rooms are always clean and well kept. The rooms are also very quiet for being on old town section of Rabat. Staff is always willing to help and check-in/check-out always runs smoothly. Pianio Bar on second floor is a great place to relax at night and grab a bite to eat. Outdoor terrace is convenient for business meetings or a late afternoon tea.
 April 2018,4,"Elegant, traditional architecture","Elegant, traditional architecture. Good location, good food in the restaurant. There were a number of bugs: (1) The light switches in the room weren't designed well. At the bedside, there were three lamps, all of which were on/off at once, so if only one person was up late reading, all three lamps were on. (2) The shower had a very high step to get in and out. (3) The bed was too firm for my tastes."
 March 2018,3,OK - nice option but no AC,"Modern hotel in center of the city. Very comfortable and nicely decorated ‚Äì service not too great but OK ‚Äì waiting 40 minutes at the pool for someone to ask for a towel = stuff like that. Rooms are comfortable but no working air conditioning ‚Äì hot with no air ‚Äì not acceptable ‚Äì so have to open windows and let the flies in. All in all, though, very nice staff and accommodating ‚Äì room again was comfortable ‚Äì wish the bathrooms were a bit cleaner ‚Äì surfaces were find but the caulking was kind of gross. Room service for breakfast was 20 minutes late ‚Äì not helpful when trying to catch a flight‚Ä¶despite calling. Would have liked to try the restaurant but they would not let us see the room until it opened or look at a menu ‚Äì heard it was good ‚Äì maybe next time."
 March 2018,3,Expensive hotel,The location of the hotel is good but the price is very high. The hotel has excellent landscaping and interior decorations. The room is not vey clean by considering the price. Breakfast is vey expensive for a person.
 February 2018,5,Classy Moroccan introduction,"This hotel is great, staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel d√©cor is beautiful, clean and very safe. Breakfast is great . Location is nice, close to all attractions but not at walking distance, so plan ahead for guided tours with pick up or taxis. Rooms are a good size and decorated really nice. The lobby staff can be a little slow.. do to computer issues.. make sure to checkout early or the night before departure."
 February 2018,5,Perfect !,"I stay at this hotel several times a year and I am always very satisfied The staff is very welcoming, pleasant and always available to guests. The rooms are very elegant with a touch of Moroccan decoration. This is changing chain hotels ! And to continue the Moroccan experience, do not hesitate to taste the Boumalek pastry shop 100 meters from the hotel"
 December 2017,2,Decadence,"I used to travel to this Hotel and I've seen it all: from the great years in the 90's until today's times. They might have been under works for about 5 years or so. When are you supposed to finalize them? Noise and more noise, that's what we find in Mr Benamour's Palace"
 December 2017,1,5 stars where?????,"My company booked a very expensive room for me in this hotel. First of all, this is not a 5 star structure. Had to change my room 3 times as the personnel at the reception couldn‚Äôt understand the meaning of quiet room: works are undergoing outside and it‚Äôs noisy all day long. At breakfast, the lady preparing my egg was chewing a pastry at the same time and her mouth was covered with crumbles till the point tat I was disgusted and had to ask her to do it again. The spa is well advertised but guess what? It‚Äôs closed. The gym is old and useless. The staff are rude and get annoyed easily. Don‚Äôt waste your money here."
 November 2017,5,Very good with minor problems,"I was at Tour Hassan for 4 days on a business trip with colleagues. The hotel in general was very good. But each room had a small different problem: eg: in my room the coffee machine didn‚Äôt work (no big deal and didn‚Äôt require fixing it). In another, the A/C didn‚Äôt work (but the weather was cold, and it was ok to open the window). In another, one tile is cracked in the bathroom. Breakfast was excellent. Location is very good (walking distance to most of the attractions and restaurants tourists are interested in). Landscaping is breathtaking. Staff very friendly. All in all, I would come back again."
 August 2017,3,Old but ok,"I stayed here for 4 days on a business trip. Quite comfortable with adequately sized rooms. Room service menu is limited and staff don't speak much English. I could get by with broken French. The gym is not well kept, full of dust and no air conditioning, problematic when outside temperatures are above 35C."
 October 2017,5,Splendid,"H√¥tel majestueux. Avec toute la magie marocaine! Recommended! The food is tasteful, the environment inside the hotel reminds you that you are in a big and wonderful palace. During the morning spare 1 hour to swim in a beautiful swimming pool with fresh and clean water."
 April 2017,5,"An architectural, culinary, and aesthetic delight: Rabat's first-class traditional finest","The Tour Hassan hotel dates from 1914, but it was thoroughly renovated in 1998 with improvements since then. Five years ago its internet access was deplorable, but about three years ago it dramatically improved. The public areas of the hotel‚Äîexcellent French and Moroccan restaurants with service to match, outstanding public areas with excellent seating for guests, make this an outstanding choice. The rooms are more than adequate and the ""junior suites"" make the hotel an excellent choice for work or leisure. I've seen many of the same staff over the last decade, and their professionalism even in times of capacity booking are impeccable. The exercise facilities are adequate and the sound of running water from the inside fountain and the cascade of (recycled) water on a wall across‚Ä¶"
 August 2017,4,Classical hotel,It is in a crowded area do you have a nice rest Moroccan restaurant and they can serve delicious burger the lobby is fantastic to enjoy taking cup of coffee so I Recommended this hotel for people who is visiting Rabat to take time and visit this nice place which is next to Hassan tower
 July 2017,4,Day trip,Booked a night in between city hopping in Morocco. Pool garden area is nice and worth the price of entry alone. Lunch and service was great. I agree it's not 5 star service or amenities but I really dont think that takes much away from the place. Front desk staff standing around not dealing with clientele questions was a bit annoying.
 June 2017,1,Giant motel 6,The service sucks the bathrooms have IKEA framed prints of Audrey Hepburn!? The view from the 'superior ' room looks like a war zone. The place was empty and they could have given us a minimally better room for what we payed
 March 2017,5,Really very very nice,"Tour Hassan is a very nice and very good hotel. Very nice room and the Presidential Suite is simply fantastic. Good food and a choises of restauants. The atmosphere during the evening at the bar, with candle light is very nice. I suggest this hotel for a high quality of stay and prices are not expensive"
 March 2017,3,not pleasant,"This hotel does not merit 5 stars, it is a factory, cold, expensive and sad ,The staff is old, sad and proud, The staff is sad and prone to leave a young waitress who runs in all the senses to render service to the customers"
 May 2017,4,Modern - traditional - high-end,"If you want a combo of modern and traditilnal, this is the palace to go. But your pockets must be deep as it will cost you circa 250 usd on an average day. Room service food is exccellent and the smalked salmon they service for breakfast is outstanding. The garden/ patio is a wonderful place to hang about and have business meetings and the conference room are nice and functional. Lovely fruit and pastry basket to welcome me, but the minibar stayed empty for my whole 5 days. Also had a watchman on my floor throughout, polite but intimidating. Big stars were coming here for the Mawazin music festival."
 May 2017,3,"dated hotel, not 5*","This is quite a dated hotel. Not 5* in international standards. We had a suite, it was decent sized but quite run down. Food was not nice and very slow service. Staff was friendly but difficult to communicate with for someone who does not speak Arabic/French. As restaurants are in a courtyard, there was substantial noise at night. Rabat doesnt have many great hotels but i think I would try the sofitel next time."
 May 2017,4,Extremely expensive,It is one of the best if not the best hotel in Rabat Huge with a nice garden Very expensive bit services are not up to the expetations Rooms are big clean and organised Staff is very friendly But services are much lower then the price
 April 2017,4,"A pleaseant ""Afro Franco"" experience in the capital of Morocco","I was in Rabat on a business trip and stayed at La Tour Hassan for 4 nights. It's a nice hotel that's a perfect blend of north African exoticness and French charm. It was like living one of Tin Tin's storybooks! Everything checked out in the hotel: Food, service, rooms and central location. Knowing that Rabat is a small town as it is, we could get anywhere in minutes. The hotel has good Wi-Fi, a nice garden and small, but does the job, pool. The Moroccans are polite people albeit a bit tough; being with them was fun."
 April 2017,4,Nice hotel just minutes away from the Medina,"We spent 3 nights in this lovely hotel. Breakfast was excellent with great service and excellent food - an impressive buffet which included lots of fresh fruit choices as well as many Moroccan and international pastry options. The only drawback of this hotel which I think the management should really do something about is the Concierge service. In the morning there was no one in the Concierge desk and we were told he only comes in the afternoon. This is unacceptable when staying as a tourist in a hotel of this level, which is considered one of the best in Rabat. As a tourist one typically goes to the Concierge desk in the morning before leaving the hotel for the day and expecting to get some advice and assistance with the day ahead. But when the Concierge only comes in the‚Ä¶"
 April 2017,4,Capital City,"This was the first hotel we visited in Morocco. The rooms were very comfortable and the lobby is very lovely. They have a pool, but it was too cold to use when we were there. The breakfast buffet was the most complete we had in all of Morocco and the coffee was especially good. Service was excellent. BTW, bring your own washcloth, because according to French tradition, none are furnished."
 February 2017,4,Pleasant stay,"I have stayed here twice for a total of 5 nights. I believe it is the oldest continuously operating hotel in the country. It is a large hotel, the service is good. The pool is nice and the workout room well equipped. While it is an older hotel, and the rooms aren't large, it is a pleasant, well laid out hotel in Morocco's capital. Most staff spoke English, and the few who didn't speak English, were fluent in French. Twice I enjoyed a nice lunch poolside. The spa was quite nice and the massage was excellent. I would recommend all travelers visit the spa for the experience of hammam. We also enjoyed the bar (former reception area) where we were offered delicious munchies."
 March 2017,4,Lovely Hotel - Beautiful garden and mosaics,"My room was large and had a sofa in. The bathroom was large too but perhaps in need of an update soon. The service at the hotel was excellent and it was lovely to sit outside in the garden, which was beautiful. The mosaics within the hotel are very impressive and really add to the Moroccan atomsphere. The hotel is in a good central location. I had a garden view room and it was quite at night. The breakfast buffet was impressive if a bit expensive. Good Wifi connectivity. Overall a very pleasant stay."
 March 2017,5,"This is a lovely hotel, well appointed in traditional Moroccan style",The room was roomy and had a great view of the peaceful gardens. Each morning we were greeted with a marvelous breakfast buffet with too many things to try. the staff was helpful and extremely courteous.
 February 2017,3,"Could have been 5 Stars, but gave it only 3.","Extremely nice hotel, built over 100 years ago built and in beautiful condition. It was raining while we were there in February 2017, so we did not use the pool or any of the outdoor facilities, although from our windows the grounds looked immaculate. Both our room and the bathroom were large, clean, and well taken care of. We were two floors up facing the courtyard and the pool area, with a large sliding door to let fresh air in. Breakfasts and dinners at the hotel were very good. WiFi was acceptable, but spotty sometimes. As with most tourists, we spent most of our daytime hours sightseeing and came back to the hotel in the evening, where we had dinner. This sliding door overlooking the grounds turned out to be critical because every time we returned to the room in the‚Ä¶"
 March 2017,5,An Excellent Hotel for Location and Service,"I spent nearly a week at Hotel la Tour Hassan this month and have nothing but praise for both the location and service. Just a ten-minute walk to the Medina area within the Old City, the hotel is steps away from a tram stop where the two tram lines for the city cross, right in front of the Cathedral of St. Peter. Both bedrooms and common areas was beautifully appointed, and the service was excellent. I ate in two of the restaurants and would recommend both for the quality and value of the meals."
 February 2017,5,Beautiful property in traditional Moroccan style.,The staff was very helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast was excellent with far too many items to try in one stay. The interior grounds are delightful and provided a great place to relax in the evening.
 March 2017,5,Excellent food,I have stayed at sofitel over 10 times but the food at la tours hassan is excellent and the food service from beutahen mohammed and bel qaid najat was so friendly and they have a excellent sense of humour best steak in morroco
 January 2017,4,Still the place to stay in Rabat,"This is a beautiful property with a long and distinguished history, still going strong after all these years. The decor is soothing and lovely, staff are friendly and helpful, the outdoors spaces very inviting, and the rooms spacious and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was full of tasty options featuring both traditional Moroccan and international fare. All told an excellent option for your stay in Rabat."
 December 2016,4,Be beautiful Decor,"This hotel is one of the beautiful decoration Moroccan style as I stayed. Good staff and friendly, Good taste of Mint Tea. Room are clean but a bit dusty in some corner or in dark area, however location is very good."
 January 2017,4,"Good, not great","Large, comfortable room; friendly, helpful staff; decent restaurant. Breakfast was excellent, offering a large choice. The negatives: Housekeeping failed to answer phone on two occasions (more than a dozen rings), and had to put requests through front desk (why have a Housekeeping button on the phone?); no English language news channels on TV."
 December 2016,3,5 stars? No way!,"I heard that this hotel is the oldest in Rabat and may be in Morocco! This can be a good or bad sign. And that's exactly what you feel as soon as you reach the doors of the hotel. Stone curved walls on the facade and beautiful but excessives mosaics on the walls. The reception, miniature for a 5 stars hotel, with a personnel that tried to show the legendary Moroccan hospitality. But, when you don't have it, you can't show it. Sure, it was 11 pm when we arrived.... but no reason to show that you are tired. This is 5 stars hotel. I had no problem to communicate in English, but my German friend had to use some broken French/ English to get by. In the hall ways , the freshness of the great hotels was completely missing. But it's probably very hard to eliminate 100% of the mildew‚Ä¶"
 November 2016,2,You can do better,"I've been coming to the Tour Hassan for a couple of years now for business and have been frustrated with the service and looking to switch. The garden is the real draw - it's beautiful. They also have a decent fitness center with a few machines. The rooms, unless you pay a lot for a suite are small and getting rundown. The service is just ok. The wifi is spotty. The breakfast is incredibly expensive - 250 DH, or $25. It's not bad, but too much to pay for a breakfast. Then, they put a coffee maker in the room, but regardless of how long you stay, they will only give you enough Nespresso pods to make two cups of coffee and after that you have to pay $4 a cup. At the prices they are charging for these rooms, they can afford to give you a Nespresso cup. Ultimately, it‚Ä¶"
 October 2016,3,Central downtown location,"Rooms small but decor is nice. Lacking in maintenance as in the room AC was not working, lamp bulb blown and TV was not working. They fixed the TV and lamp but said the room AC not working on the entire floor. Breakfast was good and nice outdoor area."
 October 2016,4,Expensive,Modern commercial hotel near the Medina. Not cheap and very expensive to have breakfast on top of hotel tariff. We found a cafe around the corner and had a very good breakfast for a fraction of the price the hotel would have charged. Poor wifi.Good service from the Concierge.
 October 2016,5,The BEST!!!,1 of the Best Hotels I have ever stayed at. Beautiful all around and in every way possible. The dining and the staff are excellent as well. Just wish we would've been able to enjoy it longer!!! My top hotel for Morocco!!
 October 2016,5,"Yes, You are in Morrocco!",This excellent hotel reflects the best in Morocco. A Beautiful lobby decorated in tile and reflective of Moorish-Andalusian design with fountains and beautiful tile work greets you on entering this hotel. This oldest continually operated hotel in Rabat dates back to 1914 while providing 2016 service and comfort. The atmosphere of the hotel reflects the best of Moroccan service with excellent food and well-appointed rooms. Excellent Dinning outside in the courtyard or in the dining room or enjoying drinks near the pool makes this hotel my first choice in Rabat.
 September 2016,4,An oasis of calm in a laid back city,"The hotel is clean, comfortable and laid back. The courtyard and pool provide a relaxing place to recharge between business obligations. Security is visible but not imposing to the point it interferes with your stay."
 August 2016,4,Great and convient place to stay,"I stayed at Tour Hassan for four nights last week. The place is quite elegant, has a very nice outdoor pool, and both in and outdoor eating and lounging areas. The food was good, but the b'fast is fixed price at $25 which seems a bit expensive if you're only having cereal, rolls, juice and coffee; maybe a good deal if you enjoy a cooked b'fast with eggs and meat. I had the standard room which was clean and comfortable with a Kink bed but little space around it."
 July 2016,5,Excellent,"The hotel is really excellent, location, design, facilities, rooms, the food everything is extra. the staff are nice and smiling all the time. I really recommend it for business visit or with family. The only problem that I noticed is with the security persons on each floor, you don't understand why they are there, and for sometime you hear them talking with other people and it is a bit noisy, and I think I takes off some of your privacy. The Wifi connection was slow to breaking sometime so may be a suggestion would be to test that in all the rooms and add some more access point to increase the signal."
 June 2016,5,Exclusive and outstanding hotel,A luxury hotel that is very famous locally. It's one of the first luxury hotel to have opened in Rabat and it's still amazing. The room is very comfortable and the bathroom is great. The staff is outstanding and very attentive.
 December 2015,5,great ambiance,"probably the top hotel in Rabat, the decor augmented with an inner garden spot and the large gardens with the swimming pool and fountain make it a point to enjoy a quiet or live conversation, or simply sit to meditate and relax. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable."
 June 2016,2,The pounding of hammers outside my window began at six am.,"Hotel is opulent in style with many oranamental and decorative touches,from the common rooms to the old fashioned carvings on desk and credenza. But my room needed repainting, with substantial staining on the walls and even the door. No clock in room, so impossible to just look up and see the time. My room had a view of a few undistinguished building, but mainly just below us, a construction site. This so dominated my use of the room that it overwhelmed every other feature. The hammering began at 6 am. By 620 am we had drilling, joining the hammering in a symphony of ugly percussion, kind of like being in the middle of . . . a construction site. So much for the possibility of sleeping in, or even staying in the room. The noise is rendering the use of the room impossible even‚Ä¶"
 June 2016,2,Good value if it was as good as it looked,"Comfortable room, well appointed. Smart looking lobby. The hotel lets itself down with room service, basic things missing like salt and pepper, butter. Apparently its not possible to buy a glass of wine to go with the meal even though it is advertised as available on the menu. Plus the aircon controls and remote in my room look like they have never been cleaned, they were in disgusting condition. Such a shame but as normal its the small stuff that lets a really fine hotel down. Sadly the hotel doesn't seem interested in responding to guests comments in house or here on tripadvisor. You might like to consider alternative venues when in town."
 February 2016,3,"Exclusivety & business hotel with support & security staff, but it costs and is too formal","A few minutes walk frrom he Trams stop at Place Al Joune & 5-10 minutes walk, you greeted at a international business & exclusive guest hotel with security and staff before you set in.. If your going on a budget and don't include breakfast, it 500 dirham roughly ¬£19pp. The breakfast is uncomfortably opulent with a potential waste unless a big conference is goin on.. Most travellers would want to go to a riad but this is a expensive alternative For the view over rooftops, breakfast, the daily rate and 4-star business style room (compared to western styles) feels more for those with higher budgets, the one item security also implies different clientele Very well trained staff and we'll maintained courtyard but less public areas didn't attract the same attention. Compact‚Ä¶"
 May 2016,3,Fine hotel,"Very clean, very comfortable room with good beds, nice swiming pool area. Fair service. Lot of security. It is not clear if it is a business or a tourism hotel. They could illuminate the corridor better"
 May 2016,5,Amazing,"The hotel is beautiful, spacious and has the most amazing garden. When in Morocco generally, make sure to enjoy a good cup of Moroccan tea, just be aware that it is usually very sweet, so if you don't like sweet that much, make sure to tell them so :)"
 May 2016,4,Great Hotel with nice quiet pool & courtyard,I stayed at this hotel for a month and really enjoyed it. You can however find great places to eat within walking distance. Beverages and snack are pretty pricey but you can buy soft drinks and snacks from the small supermarket around to corner if your going to stay any length of time. Otherwise great place and friendly and helpful staff!
 April 2016,3,"Gorgeous setting, okay food","I had been to Tour Hassan's restaurant many years ago, and wanted to return for dinner. It remains gorgeous. The staff is selectively attentive. The food is surely nice, but hardly spectacular. The prices are high."
 April 2016,4,"Mid size grand hotel centrally located in Rabat, more government & business guests than tourists","Our room faced on the large central courtyard garden and pool. The hotel was very quiet and comfortable. The reception area and hallways were nice, but not grand like the other public spaces in the hotel. Because we had just arrived in Morocco, we had dinner both nights in the hotel, once in the French restaurant and once in the Moroccan restaurant. They were good, but not outstanding. The valet parking worked well. The room had a nice coffee maker, a rariety in Morocco. An easy walk to Mohammed V avenue, the Medina, the Kasbah, the river promenade and of course the Hassan tower and masoleum. The staff was correct, but not warm."
 October 2015,4,"""Royal stay""","I loved staying in this hotel. Everything was so fancy and made me feel like royalty. I enjoyed Morocco so much and this place was just magical. Everything was so great, the rooms where so awesome, the staff was very nice and the food :)"
 March 2016,5,"Excellent and very professional, the best place to host conferences","I would highly recommend this hotel for business and holiday. the staff is very professional and the quality is of high standard. Also, very good location in Rabat, close to many nice places to visit."
 April 2016,4,"Not Sure It's Five Star, But OK","The rooms here are comfortable and well appointed, although a bit worn. I was surprised that on a very warm day and night they had not turned on the air conditioning yet - told me that I should open a window if my room was too warm to sleep. The service overall was good, although the front desk staff seemed a bit slow in taking care of things. Breakfast was very good. The hotel overall and especially the lobby are very well done in a classic Moroccan style. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, as the overall experience was good. ."
 April 2016,4,Nice find...I like it,2 nights here. Warm welcome and room is fine (337) with town view (blocks of flats). Nice breakfast... interesting to have bacon on the menu. Very tolerant country I see. There was an elderly Jewish guy at table with his wife... nice to see harmony. Reception gave me a map of a nice 2+ hour walk taking in the big must see sights. Nice secluded outdoor pool. Tagine for dinner was sumptious.... enjoyed every mouthful. I will be back!
 March 2016,5,Beautiful Hotel with Garden & Friendly Staff,"We stayed for 4 nights at La Tour Hassan. The service was great, rooms were beautiful. They upgraded us to bigger rooms overlooking the Riyadh (Courtyard) and pool. Rooms were spacious, comfy, and they offer free wifi at all the hotel facilities including the rooms. Free complimentary mineral water that is renewed on daily badis, free nespresso coffee and a welcome fruit plate and Moroccan sweets. Waiters at breakfast are extremely friendly and helpful and are willing to get you anything you want to your table. The garden is beautiful and very relaxing. Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely repeat our stay there."
 April 2016,1,This place is anything but hospitality,"I stayed three nights at the Tour Hassan as part of a business trip that unfortunately meant I was booked by the conference organiser into this hotel. For the price and supposed star range, this place was very disappointing. Apart from being cold, with unbeatable rooms, and having no restaurant open outside local eating hours (meaning a supposed 5 star hotel offers nothing to eat to a business traveller from another time zone other than entirely overpriced room service), this hotel stands for anything but hospitality. I was shocked about the poor level of english by most staff, the complete lack of professionalism by the reception staff who messed around with my reservation, but most importantly, the incredible rudeness the staff displayed. Upon complaining about an incorrect‚Ä¶"
 March 2016,5,Really good,Good hotel with top standard. I can recommend it. Very friendly people. Nice city and I really could get back for vacation. I do not recommend Rabat for children since it is more a place of culture and nature.
 February 2016,4,Lovely!,"Wonderful start to a tour of the country. Quiet and personalized service (in February, at least). Beautiful facilities, courtyard, room. Staff was proud to help us learn about Moroccan food at breakfast! Not extensive understanding of English, but eager to provide assistance. We flew into Casablanca to begin our journey and I was fairly concerned about getting to Rabat. Staff here arranged for taxi to pick us up for transport and their arrangements worked just fine-driver waiting for us at airport! Appreciated this extra help!"
 March 2016,4,"Beautiful architecture, small rooms, high prices!","This hotel is very nice to walk around because the architecture, furniture, gardens, fountains, and pool are very pretty. The buffet breakfast costs $27 so I never ate there. Drinks at the bar are $7-$10. You can find much better prices just down the street at local restaurants and bars. The room was nice, but small. Walkways between the bed and desk were small as well as between the closet and the wall. See the photos. The 5 am call to prayer from the local mosque woke me up a few times."
 February 2016,5,La Mamounia of Rabat,"The place is Magic , wonderful , extraordinary !!!!!!! You will never expect that behind that Ugly entrance there is a wonderful Palace inside with a great Flowery Garden , great food Specially Breakfast and Moroccan Restaurant ,huge room , gorgeous SPA ,helpful Staff , spectacular service . If you want to be treated as king stay in Hassan , all Moroccan Tradition is there , you can see in the room , reception , restaurant , garden , tradition cloths of the team . Thank you Hassan and i will recommend to all my friends ."
 February 2016,5,Magic place with great food,"Because of multiple business trip to Morocco i finish always staying for a night or 2 in different hotels . But Tour Hassan hotel really attracted and seduce me . From entrance to room and all design is spectacular . If you want to see a top type of Moroccan artisan... Come and enjoy it in Hassan , everything is traditional , historical. I had a pleasure to talk to some staff in the bar and reception , all been so professional , they answer all your needs and guide you if needed . I enjoyed the Moroccan food and i guaranty can not find anywhere only in Hassan . Thanks to small ladies in the breakfast station , the selections and the food is very good . And thank you for serving my omelette on the table . Hassan is only the hotel where I will go back for sure , thank you and‚Ä¶"
 November 2015,5,A wonderful place,"This an exquisite place to stay, a touch of retro and a peaceful surrounding in a busy part of the city of Rabat. Well trained staff. Super decoration with a wonderful taste. A place to recommand at all cost."
 June 2015,5,Then only place where I am going to go back,"Excellent service amazing personal, very close to everything, great and rich breakfast (from Moroccan cuisine to western and European cuisine) and above all that can last for the whole day if you want to. Safe and very secure."
 January 2016,5,Spacious suites and beautiful central garden,"Our large suite was decorated with modern versions of classic Moroccan design and a wonderful bed. The welcome tea and ample snacks set a wonderful mood. I was blown away by the huge breakfast buffet. Even in January you will want to walk into the central garden with its restful greenery and pools. The hotel is very near the medina, a good city to start a tour of Morocco."
 May 2015,4,Beautiful hotel with great location,I stayed at the Tour Hassan in May 2015 as I was on business trip to Rabat. The hotel has a beautiful typical architecture and indoor decoration. It has a nice lobby area and very pleasant garden and outdoor terrace area. The room is very big and decorated in traditional Moroccan style. The hotel is very well located a walk away from the down town area and the train station.
 January 2016,5,Luxury & Comfort,We felt very relaxed and looked after by a welcoming staff. Our room was well appointed and comfortable. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet of Moroccan specialties. Beautiful grounds and everything you need for a relaxing stay in Rabat. Would stay here again.
 December 2015,4,"Beautiful, centrally located hotel with great food",The hotel is beautifully decorated and has a nice outdoor area. The rooms are a bit small but are lovely. The hotel is quiet. The staff is professional. The breakfast buffet is amazing as was a dinner buffet. Locted near to major tourist attractions.
 January 2016,4,Great Hotel,"Spent 4 nights in this stunning hotel in the centre of Rabat. I think I was in a Junior suit and there are only some slight room for improvement. WiFi, although free throughout the hotel is very slow and hit and miss in the room. The single continues to fluctuate and randomly drops in and out at inconvenient times. It will serve the purpose for normal visitors but when here on business and the internet becomes essential it can be a struggle to get work done. The suit itself is on the small side with very little room between the end of the MASSIVE bed and the desk so it became a struggle to get to the desk to do some work (see picture). The view is not great although as I am hear on business the view is not a priority. The rest of the hotel is stunning. The lobby, bar area and‚Ä¶"
 December 2015,5,Luxurious hotel,"We stayed for several days in this hotel while my husband attended a conference held there. A former palace, the hotel was beautiful - both the interior rooms and the central courtyard. It is located within walking distance of the medina, the harbour, the Tour Hassan and other sites. The rooms were lovely, and the staff polite and helpful."
 April 2015,4,Nice hotel,"This hotel is nice and really well decorated in a Moroccan elegant style. Our room was nice and spacious, with lovely furniture and everything was impeccable. The bed was amazing. We ordered some food to in room dining and it took them a little bit more than one our to deliver. The food wasn't very good. We ate because we were hungry, but it was disappointing."
 November 2015,4,Lovely place to stay,"Comfortable and clean room, very nice staff, good choice and quality of breakfast and dinner, internet was reliable, great decor, relaxed feel. What more could I ask for. Would I recommend this hotel? Yes I would"
 November 2015,5,Love it,What beautiful hotel. A very nice mix between old and new style. Good place to relax and to have a beer or a diner. Nice service. Quality service. And for a moment Europe visit the opposite Irish pub. Super place to be with good price performance ratio.
 October 2015,4,"Moroccan food, music, people - in one place","Loved the experience in this upmarket hotel. Received a tray with Moroccan tea and biscuits on arrival because we had to wait for 5 minutes for our rooms - what a delight. The rooms are spacious and everything that you expect from a good hotel is available in the room and on-suite lounge. Internet access/speed is great too. The area around the pool is very relaxing, even if you need to work! The breakfast variety was great, from local to international - staff very willing to assist to meet all your requirements. The architecture and interior of the hotel are"
 September 2015,4,Comfortable beds,"The bed was great, with a fluffy mattress pad. Breakfast choices were limited and when the trays were emptied they were not refilled. Located near the souk, which is small and not worth going to. Not well located if you are in Rabat for business. Limited English speaking staff."
 September 2015,3,Above average but not very good either. 3.1/2 is fair.,"La Tour Hassan is a decent hotel in Rabat but not sure it deserves all the accolades I have seen here. It is well located, close to the Medina, city center and other attractions but the hotel itself while clean and neat looks a bit tired and may need a facelift. The carpets in the hallways are worn down and musty. Stay away from the room bar/fridge as well, the prices are just a rip off. Something like $ 4 for a bottle of water one can buy for $.50 cents at a small grocery store next door. Bfast is ok but overpriced as well. Do yourself a favor as well, make sure you get a room with the garden view. The views from rooms looking the back of the hotel are not what I would call pleasant."
 September 2015,3,"Great service, poor Internet","La Tour Hassan is a traditional Moroccan hotel with expansive areas, a garden with pool and fountain and great service. The reason for reducing my rating to 3 stars is due to a number of reasons, in order: (1) the Internet was virtually non-existent or painfully slow - in my room and elsewhere in the hotel, which made it difficult to work productively (2) the business centre is 2 desks with 2 computers in the main foyer - again with limited Internet and limited service (3) Although I did have a robe in my room, slippers were not available (4) The standard room was small - there was no space between the desk and bed to comfortably move around (5) One staff member (an intern) provided wrong directions to a location which meant that I walked for 90 minutes in the heat looking for‚Ä¶"
 September 2015,5,Beautiful palace,The best place to go in rabat just close to the medina on your left .the restaurant offers you a wonderful couscous even you have to be patient to get it.....garden and pool outside are very nice and quiet. Massage service not so expensive and pleasant for Relaxing as fitness room . The only bad thing is the wifi network wich is very bad always disconnected so difficult to work.
 June 2015,4,"Amazing hotel, great location","Great venue, very expensive though. Rooms a bit too small for the price. They do make up for it in comfort. The location is perfect. Close to old city and downtown Rabat. You can walk to many places from there, including the ocean. Breakfast was very expensive. I chose to eat outside. Two streets down from hotel, there is a good French bakery and a caf√©. However, chances are if you're staying here, you won't mind the overpriced breakfast."
 August 2015,3,This hotel could/should be so much better,"Hotel La Tour Hassan positions itself as a top one in Rabat. When you look from far it really looks like it but you better do not go into details. The luxury room is a good size. The bed is very comfortable. But, there were holes in the pillows. Nobody replaced/removed left-over cookies offered the first day.The wifi was constantly disappearing. The pool area is ok but nobody will bring towels to you. The pool itself is quite cold. We waited for a tea to come over 30 min. Food at La Maison Arabe was very good. We went there on Friday evening because they claim that there is a spectacle that night. The spectacle consisted of 1 musician, quite disappointing.The service of the reception was not great, unless I asked for something repeatedly, no action was taken. For what you pay‚Ä¶"
 August 2015,5,Excellent,Good location - about a 10 minute walk to the medina. Gracious service by the staff. Front desk especially were very helpful arranging car service to my next stop in Morocco. Understated luxury throughout. The grounds are spotless. They are constantly cleaning. Pool area very relaxing and comfortable. The French restaurant is superb. Highly recommended.
 August 2015,3,Good hotel but needs few things,"The Hotel la Tour Hassan is a nice hotel. However, there a few things that we would like to point out: 1. There is no sprinkler system in the hotel. Something essential for safety. 2. Smoke detectors are located ONLY in the corridors. The rooms do not have them. Fires usually start in the room, not corridors. 3. The walls in the rooms need a bit of paint. there are marks every where. 4. Carpets need changing and updating in the rooms. 5. The hotel advertises itself as a business hotel. However, even though there is wifi, the connectivity is VERY VERY slow. There was a meeting on telecoms being held in the hotel and participants were complaining of the bad speeds. It is about time that the internet connection is upgraded from the hotel to the outside. I am not the first one to‚Ä¶"
 March 2015,4,nice but expensive,"the hotel is peace of are and the service of the really good the rooms are nice but kind of old, the bed was comfy all restaurants were great specially the one in the garden its in the middle of everything the rate was high"
 August 2015,4,Pretty Good,Air conditioning in room was making a very loud noise all night. I was surprised at how small my room was. Pool was a bit underwhelming. Staff were friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the pool bar and restaurant. All and all decent hotel
 May 2015,5,Beautiful hotel in the middle of the city,"After an hour drive from the Casablanca airport, we arrived a Hotel la Tour Hassan at 2am. The lobby was dark but a Front Desk Manager and a Bellman were there to greet us. The walk through the low lit lobby was a beautiful introduction to Moroccan hospitality and decor. Our room was lovely with a center room overlooking the swimming pool. Dinner in Maison Arabe was delightful. Buffet breakfasts are outstanding."
 April 2015,5,A Great to Begin,"We spent the first nights of our Moroccan adventure here, and it could not have been better. Our room was quiet and perfectly comfortable. The room had a sofa, which always helps, and a beautiful view of the pool. The bathroom was especially nice with a deep tub. We ate one night at the hotel's Moroccan restaurant, where we had harira soup followed by wonderful shish kebab with vegetables and rice. Everything was perfectly seasoned. The location was also perfect. We could walk to the souk and to the corniche.I can't imagine that there is a better place to stay in Rabat."
 June 2015,3,Nice hotel in the center of Rabat,"Very nice hotel with beautiful garden and terrace in the heart of Rabat. The room was spacious but the I would have preferred a typical Morrocan decoration instead of the modern version, which was not really my style. Breakfast was OK, nothing more, nothing less. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, I would recommend the hotel because it's very comfortable, but there's a price to pay..."
 May 2015,3,"Wonderful bed, terrible wifi, mediocre service and bathroom.","For the price, which is quite high for Morocco, I would have expected perfection. Our welcome was lacking. The staff seemed distracted and cold. The room was spacious with a very comfortable bed and pillows. The bathroom was another story. Hard water marks were abundant and the complimentary toiletries had clearly not been refreshed after the last guest (the cardboard container for one of the items was empty and the others had been warped by water droplets). The wifi in the room was pitiful! not only did the connection keep dropping, but the reception in the room was at best ""one bar"". We had better wifi connection in some of the riads we stayed in in the middle of nowhere. I expected better from this hotel!"
 May 2015,5,Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff,"This is the place to stay in Rabat. The hotel offers a real imagine of morocco with outstanding facilities and traditional moroccan hospitaly . The rooms are spacious very clean and the bed is very comfortable which so hard to find in hotels even though 5 stars . I enjoyed the marvelous breakfast buffet and incredible lunch and dinner . The staff was extremely courteous and very attentive specially Fadwa , Safae and Meriem they were very helpful and professional. Even though the outstanding facilities and the luxury of the hotel but always the staff who really makes your stay fantastic . I big thumbs up specially to the girls in the buffet . Thank you girls for your hospitality and your service."
 May 2015,5,Absolute Luxury,"We only stayed at this hotel for a night, but could have stayed for much longer. Our room/suite was very spacious and luxurious. We overlooked the lush courtyard with its inviting pool and outdoor bar and restaurant. The bed was amazingly comfortable and we loved our breakfast in the courtyard. Couldn't recommend it highly enough. Rabat town was also very interesting and a great introduction to Morocco."
 May 2015,4,Elegant and Comfortable,"I stayed in this traditional style hotel for two nights. The room was large, quiet and beautifully decorated. The bathroom is modern with a bathtub and separate shower. From the outside the hotel looks modest, but inside is a very large and beautiful lobby, and in the back a beautiful garden with a small swimming pool. The food is excellent, including a very nice breakfast. I found the service to be quite good. When I realized that I had forgotten to bring an adapter plug, the person at the front desk gave me one, to keep, with his compliments."
 May 2015,4,"Historic hotel, good food","This hotel was built by the French in the early 20th century and is beautifully decorated and maintained. Our room 212 overlooked the pool/courtyard. Bathrobes and slippers are provided along with high quality toiletries. The breakfast buffet featured a good selection of pastries, some cheeses, yogurt, nuts, dried fruit, made to order eggs and fresh fruit. Our tour group ate one lunch and one dinner at the hotel, both of which were enjoyable. Dinner consisted of a wonderful lamb tagine with couscous and vegetables. French wines can be expensive, but one Moroccan wine Medaillon, a red wine, is excellent and inexpensive. Don't be afraid to order it. My only complaint about our 3-night stay would be that I felt overcharged for the transfer from Rabat Sale airport to the‚Ä¶"
 January 2015,5,A Real Taste of Morocco,"We enjoyed an outstanding lunch experience at La Tour Hassan. The hotel offers a real taste of Morocco with outstanding facilities and deluxe decor and furnishings. It was such a treat to enjoy a variety of local appetizers, displayed with color and quality. The main course was delicious and abundant. Offering a variety of pastries with mint tea at the end of the lunch topped off a wonderful experience and I can highly recommend a visit to La Tour Hassan for a traditional meal and overnight stay. Such a lovely hotel."
 March 2015,3,Awesome lunch,"We stopped here to eat a traditional Morrocan lunch and all we can say is if you plan to eat one you may not want to eat for several hours before! We were brought local wine and beer (which was excellent)and then we were given a plate piled high with fresh vegetables of all kinds and we assumed that was lunch, a huge salad. But then after we finished that they brought us another huge plate piled high with rice, potatoes and fish or chicken! I didn't have any room left but ate a little to be kind and it was delicious! And again another plate was brought to each of us which had on it a huge apple, banana and an orange! Also we were served Moroccan tea which was with mint and honey; very sweet and flavorable. Wow! Happy we don't eat like that all the time is all I can say! ‚Ä¶"
 March 2015,5,Fantastic Hospitality,"Definitely a great place to stay in Rabat. The staff is exceptionally courteous and very attentive. The hotel interior is beautiful, and the garden/pool area is immaculately maintained with plenty of seats in quiet and shady places. We have been here for 5 days and will be here for most of April, so this is an initial great impression. The restaurant food is somewhat pricey, but very well prepared and absolutely delicious. The room is clean, quiet and comfortable. There is a modest but very adequate exercise facility with treadmills, elliptical machines, benches and light dumbbells. The Wi-Fi is included, and so far very reliable."
 March 2015,4,True Moroccan hospitality,"A very nice to stay on your next visit to Rabat. Located close to the old medina, Tour Hassan is a landmark in Rabat. Very clean and comfortable rooms, excellent hospitality and service, a pleasant outside garden where you can enjoy a late afternoon tea! Truly a charming place. A real Moroccan classic."
 March 2015,5,A classy hotel with superior service,"I joined the Tour group as a solo traveler with my own room. This hotel was converted from a palace and the details in architecture and interior design differentiate it from the other 5 star hotels. The lobby is inviting, the staircase and chandeliers fit for a palace. The front desk is very helpful and the restaurant staff never let my water glass go empty. We had lunch buffet which is way beyond my expectation. The room has a coach with two side chairs and still spacious. The bathroom could use a bit upgrading. It is very clean. The hotel is quiet, and comfortable. There Is a pool, spa services. The grounds is well groomed with the typical fountain and flower beds. It is a low key,relaxed place and i will recommend it to anyone."
 February 2015,4,Moroccan Charm,"Picture a bar from a vintage movie with the gentlemen in white linen suits, straw hats and smoking unfiltered cigarettes in a smoky Moroccan bar and you have just envisioned the bar at this hotel. A very relaxing, Moorish style throughout the hotel makes this a great hotel to stay at. Several nice restaurants within walking distance and very helpful staff complete this picture. The only downside is very poor quality wifi capabilities. If that were fixed I'd give this hotel 5 stars."
 February 2015,3,"Probably a safe bet, but not a very exciting one","Clean, safe, lots of space, a lovely atrium, sounds all rather good, but on the other hand nothing to remember this place as a landmark of distinction. Decent breakfast choice, but the surrounding area does not seem tremendously attractive."
 February 2015,5,Lovely,"We were given a large room overlooking the beautiful garden (alas, the fountains weren't fonting in February). The king bed was excellent. The breakfast buffet was exceptional: wonderful fruits, pastries, smoked salmon, omelettes to order. Good coffee, too. Dinner at the hotel's Maison Arabe restaurant was fun: lovely surroundings which you enter through an arabesque door and look out on lit plants (bamboo?) to local music. Vegtable soup was delicious as was the lamb tagine, presented under a dome. The hotel is well located for walking and enjoying local sights, coming back to neat greeters/porters in Moroccan dress. Service, from reception to waiters to manager trying to help with Internet connection, was excellent."
 December 2014,4,Impressive,"Though the room I got was small, looked old, and not very well cared for, the hotel it self was great. Food is excellent, the lobby and restaurant impressive, and the location great, close to the center of the city."
 January 2015,4,Our best hotel stay in Morocco,Lavish and beautiful building interior. Certainly feels like being in a palace. The rooms were in top shape. The bed was grand. The only (minor) drawback was their charge for a glass of water with dinner - likewise all the other hotels on Morocco that we stayed in. We would come back here again.
 January 2015,5,‚ÄúMagnificent Hotel‚Äù,"This is a beautiful hotel in a convenient location that is easy to access by car and is a short enough walk to all the main sites. We were given a very nice upgrade for free to a superb room with a very comfortable bed and overlooking wonderful gardens. A very well-informed receptionist with beautiful English gave us a lot of detail about the history of Rabat which enriched our stay. The restaurant is superb with very friendly and helpful staff and features a musician playing Moroccan music on an Ud. A drawback is that the hotel has no garage, meaning that the car had to be parked on the street at the front of the hotel, and while it was safe, other drivers need to be aware of that. Overall it was a great experience and will stay again!"
 January 2015,4,Quick stay but very royal !,"We booked 30 minutes before arriving and we had a good discount ! It was still expensive like all the good hotels in Rabat but we chose it only because it was close to the location we needed to go next morning. The service was really good ! The receptionist called me by my name as she remembered I had just called probably, it was a nice touch ! They even upgraded up to a nice suite with a beautiful view ! The bed was very comfortable, the shower was good and very hot ! The only thing I would complain is about the 2 towels only as I think it should have 2 per person. And the wi-fi doesn't work even tough you look connect! We had dinner in the French restaurant and we were served by a very friendly man who paid attention to all the details and really cared if everything was going‚Ä¶"
 December 2014,4,"Classic hotel, updated with style","This centrally located, business-oriented hotel has enough character to make it memorable. The check-in lobby is a bit dark but the restaurant and bar area, on the upper floor that used to be the original entrance, has beautiful Moroccan architecture and corners. The rooms are an adequate size, and the pool and spa are quite nice. The breakfast is a bit of a rip-off at 200 dirhams--it is a pretty thin spread--but at least they do not charge for espresso when you reject the regular coffee. Laundry prices are quite reasonable for a business hotel. One oddity is that the room brochure recommends you not drink the tap water but then it is difficult if not impossible to get a replacement for the mineral water originally placed in the room. When I asked for more water, I got‚Ä¶"
 November 2014,2,Badly run hotel and Rabat is sadly a dump,The stay started badly when on check-in we were made to wait for a considerable time whilst one member of staff finished a phone call. Having one member of staff to handle check ins when you check in early evening is poor in a 5 star hotel. I was then asked to pay the total cost of our stay on my credit card. I was sure I paid by Expedia but without Internet I couldn't confirm. The man on reception said if it's expedia then you won't have paid for the hotel. I reluctantly agreed to pay. Once in my room with Internet I checked my credit card bill and could prove I had paid in full. I took this to reception expecting an immediate refund but was told that because it was the weekend they couldn't do anything as the manager wasn't in! Unbelievable. It took 3 days to get a refund. We‚Ä¶
 October 2014,5,"Elegant, restful, delicious","This beautiful hotel in the European quarter has both comfort and tradition, with a lovely outdoor bar/lounge area near, but separated from, the pool. The restaurant is also a star, with nouvelle takes on traditional Moroccan dishes and very attentive service. The chicken with preserved lemons and olives at the hotel restaurant was the single best dish I ate on an eight day, four city culinary tour of Morocco. In other cities you will want to stay at riadhs in the medina, but in Rabat, I would stay here again."
 September 2014,5,Beautiful hotel,It was just lovely. The hotel had a beautiful pool (although cold water!) and semi-formal gardens as well. The food at the hotel was wonderful ‚Äì I ate far too much of it but it was too yummy not to. There were lots of rooms for relaxing in the lobby area with more lovely tilework everywhere. My only quibble was that the shower had a far too small barrier so water got all over the floor but that seems to be universal of late.
 September 2014,4,It felt great being here,"Yes, it was rather expensive I should say, especially for Morocco, but luckily there are no regrets. The stay was great, the room was large enough and very clean, with a beautiful view over the internal courtyard -lots of green, water, birds and colorful tiles. We sat in the garden for drinks a couple of times and it was like you'd never want to leave. Staff were very helpful -french and arabic are preferred languages, but you may also use English of course. They were very patient with my basic French. I liked the breakfast, it was maybe a bit too continental at times but certainly good. I am not sure about the location since I was attending a conference some 20mins away and did not have a lot of time to explore the immediate surroundings. I have had colleagues telling me bad‚Ä¶"
 October 2014,5,Very Enjoyable,"We stayed three nights visiting with our son who joined as he had a break from his international studies in Meknes. This is a first class hotel!! We were treated to bottled water, fresh fruit and cookies in our room. Remembering that this is Morocco. Breakfast was excellent each day. We enjoyed dinner each night trying some of the different cuisines they offer. The staff is friendly and very helpful. We had one afternoon off and enjoyed it by the pool. My wife loves pools and that is why we picked the hotel. Internet worked most of the time and was very speedy. Again this is Morocco. We highly recommend this hotel to any one traveling through Rabat."
 July 2014,5,Great stay...twice,"We stayed at this hotel on the two ends of our adventure in Morocco, as we flew in and out of Rabat. The staff is very welcoming. The style in the public areas is traditional Morocco, but the rooms were more contemporary. Our first room was smaller, but the second quite large. Both times the beds were very comfortable, and everything is clean. We felt safe the entire time in the hotel. The hotel is in quick walking distance to the train station and restaurants."
 September 2014,4,Great suite,"Unfortunately we were only here overnight. Our room was upgraded to a lovely suite with comfortable bed and plenty of space. The buffet in the evening was fine as was breakfast. Lovely Moroccan architecture, clean and spacious."
 August 2014,4,A true Palace in Morocco,"This is a beautiful hotel that sums up Moroccan style, charm and hospitality. The lobby and swimming pool area is typical Moroccan arabesque style whilst the rooms are modern, airy and comfortable. Dotted around are great black and white photos of actors and writer! The restaurant serves a great breakfast with a wide range of Moroccan and western food (seriously good) lunch and dinner is good but not as good as breakfast... The staff were attentive and very helpful and many spoke perfect French, English and Arabic! ...I only rate the hotel as very good as they were construction works (although I did not hear anything in the room or the restaurant!) so when these are finished I would rate it excellent."
 October 2013,4,Hotel Tour Hassan,"I stayed for a month in this hotel, she I moved to Morocco and was very pleased with the hospitality of the staff, the excellent location and the Moroccan atmosphere. It is particularly well located for an easy walk to both the Medina as well as downtown with it's restaurant's and shops. I have continued to go back to the hotel regular basis because of their attractive terrace, an excellent location for a drink in the evening. And the staff still recognise me after all these years..."
 May 2014,4,Beautiful hotel with great service,"The rooms are a bit cramped, but the staff is friendly, especially the cleaning ladies. The location is excellent, lots of character in every corner. I wanted to take a video of all the little nooks it has - very historic place that has been renovated recently. Beautiful. The gym is small but is airy, with large windowed wall overlooking the pool and hotel on the second floor. The lack of decent wifi in the rooms is a nuisance that they need to correct, although the connection is corrected in the lobby and bar areas."
 June 2014,5,"Amazing hotel, amazing, staff, amazing service!!!","The La Tour Hassan In Rabat is a Moroccan gem. Right in the heart of Rabat, a 5 minute walk from the Medina, this hotel is our luxury from start to finish. The service is impeccable. The grounds are beautiful. And the interior is authentic Moroccan tiles and accents everywhere you look. This is a first class hotel that cannot be beat. I was fortunate enough to stay at the La Tour Hassan for a week for a work conference. The service staff that looked after our conference room were excellent we even had our own security staff that stayed outside the conference room door all day, and he was such a gentleman. All the staff, both men and women, we're outstanding. His is how all fine hotels should be and everyone should spend time at the La Tour Hassan to understand how a fine hotel‚Ä¶"
 April 2014,4,Beautiful hotel with a lot of character,"The grounds are gorgeous and the interior immaculate. A small but truly boutique hotel. Food was great as was ambiance and location, walking distance from most main locations in Rabat. But as a place to stay for work, the lack of decent wifi was annoying. Unless you're in the lobby, forget about getting even a decent connection, let alone a strong one. Gym was also a bit lame, but had what you needed for basic workout."
 May 2014,5,From beginning to end,"The entrance to the hotel was not good I was to be picked up at the airport and to be delivered to the hotel.. Not so. When I arrived by taxi at the hotel I was told my car had just arrived at the airport( one hour late and was waiting for me).So it began. I was told I had to pay the taxi. NO MONEY-OH well. But a young man employee Mr. Mahdi then did the best he could to at least explain to me why . Well the hotel and it eats are very good but Mr. Mahdi made certain I was taken care of as best this hotel could. Including I asked as I am a business traveler that if possible even though this is not a tourist hotel that Mr Mahdi arrange a car, a driver and a guide to take a day trip to Fez. Well he did it all and it was great. So the Hotel gets a best rating from me because of‚Ä¶"
 April 2014,5,Absolutely perfect!,"After staying in a horrific hotel around the corner, it was a very pleasant surprise to enter the Tour Hassan. It is beautiful, clean, has delicious restaurants and landscaping to enjoy a meal or a drink, and exceptional service! The rooms or sparkling clean, in good repair, and are stocked with a small mini-bar and complementary fruit and local cookies on a side table. The buffet breakfast is good, and the restaurants even better. The location is walking distance to restaurants, a small grocery market, an outlet store to purchase alcohol, and to the outdoor market and waterfront. Staying here truly made my 2 week business trip to Morocco feel like a vacation!"
 April 2014,4,Jasmine smelled garden,An old palace built in 1914 with a nice garden. I did not stay at teh hotel but spent 2 of my evenings in its restaurants. the food is good at the Arabe Restaurant. It is lovely to sit & chat at the garden while drinking wine.
 April 2014,5,Best hotel in Rabat,"Stayed here for a night. It's a 5 star hotel with a beautiful courtyard housing a pool, spa and several restaurants. The staff is friendly and service good. Had dinner and breakfast at the restaurant and was especially impressed with the breakfast selection. The rooms are impeccably kept, clean and pleasantly decorated. Sleep quality is excellent. Had a room towards the courtyard and it was quiet even though people were having drinks by the pool. Didn't have time to try the spa, but heard that it's really good. There's a Carrefour store quite close by. Turn right when coming out from the main entrance. Immediately turn left and walk two blocks straight ahead - the store is just across the street. Would definitely recommend this hotel if staying in Rabat."
 March 2014,4,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed two nights; room was clean and reasonably spacious with a lovely view of the pool and courtyard area. A number of restaurants and even a little local supermarket are all in walking distance. The breakfast was very good but the hotel was very crowded and the breakfast service suffered--we had to ask them to bring out clean bowls, plates and fill food trays."
 March 2014,4,Elegant and comfortable,"I stayed at La Tour Hassan for about two weeks for work. It was elegant and comfortable with friendly service, a nice gym and pool area and large spread for breakfast. Great location if you are planning on using the train, just a pleasant 5 min walk. As a New Yorker, being able to use the train so easily from this hotel was a big plus! On the downside, the internet was spotty and the front desk messed up our reservation and was not helpful with restaurant recs around town. Other than that, it was a great stay and I will be back."
 March 2014,5,Spa review.,"I didn't have the chance to stay at the hotel as I had already booked in the one next door. But I spent more time dining here in the end. The restaurant is superb and so is the staff. The spa was amazing. We had the chance to be only the 4 of my family in it at the time and stayed approximately 3hours. Between the massage and hammam/saunas, resting rooms and complementary tea I would have stayed all night. It was very replacing and affordable."
 March 2014,5,A beautiful hotel with great service,"This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. Service is great, the rooms are clean, and the beds are fabulous. A tray of cookies, nuts, and fresh fruits in the room was a nice welcome. The breakfast and lunch buffets were fantastic. We also ate at the traditional Moroccan restaurant and the food was equally great. The piano bar is nice for light meals and drinks, but we overheard, more than once, disputes about charges for drinks not ordered or received. They were resolved by the customers having to accept bottled water as they were told the bar could not give credit back. It seemed a little strange, so check your receipt. Internet worked fine in the room. The hotel has a fitness room but some of the equipment seemed outdated and some did not work. But the hotel is‚Ä¶"
 March 2014,5,A Traditional Morocco Experience,"A beautiful and fully restored 100 year old Moroccan hotel in the heart of Rabat. The staff was very professional and courteous. The food was superb to include a full breakfast buffet with all fresh fruit, eggs to order on the grill, breads, pastries, juices of all kinds, and of course coffee and teas. I highly recommend this hotel if you want a traditional Moroccan experience with a French flavor. The stall also all speak French, and most also speak English. I hope to return with my family."
 February 2014,5,A home away from home,"I spent three lovely days at La Tour Hassan Palace, which is by far the best hotel in Rabat. I am spending half of my life travelling worldwide and I must say this is one of the hotels I have felt most comfortable and at home, mostly thanks to the personnel who are most charming and welcoming. The decoration in this hotel is a perfect combination of traditional Moroccan crafstmanship mixed with modern, comfy design. Excellent Moroccan restaurant, ""La maison Arabe"", as well. Despite the luxury, I felt at home and, as a result, I would definitely go back to La Tour Hassan."
 December 2013,5,Simply AMAZING!,"I am a very frequent traveller for business and I can say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Since 2006, I visited over 50 hotels in different countries and La Tour Hassan had the perfect mix of comfort, cleanliness and great service that I have been looking for. I spent 3 months for business from October 2013 to January 2014 and I was lucky to be in a place that makes you experience Moroccan traditions, taste and flavors while working. Business travelers: Internet is available wired and wireless and the hotel has multiple repeaters and wireless routers in every floor which makes the connection always available. There is still room to improve the speed and to allow VPN accesses. Staff is awesome. Not only do they listen to you when you ask for something. They‚Ä¶"
 January 2014,4,Delightful Stay,We only spent the night but it was a very nice clean hotel with much charm. Our room was on the small side and the bathroom very small but the bed was really comfortable. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Good value.
 January 2014,5,A real 5 Star Hotel in Rabat - Morocco,"This super hotel lives up to it's name - it is a palace for those of us lucky enough to stay there. The service wherever you are in the hotel is excellent, the rooms are bright,comfortable and clean, There is a selection of restaurants to choose from depending if you want Moroccan, French or International cuisine and all offer very high quality fare. Despite being 'down-town' the lovely courtyard and pool offer serenity and relaxation. Like all super hotels, they never sit on their laurels and this one is no exception with work already taking place to improve upon the already high standards and beautiful surroundings enjoyed by their guests. A romantic weekend away - why not?"
 August 2013,4,Extravagant and authentic in centre ville,"Great location if you want to sight see in Rabat. Walking distance to the medina, des oudayas, the train station and plenty of good restaurants. Ideal location if you're on foot. Free and dependable WiFi (I did not say fast) throughout with routers all over. Pool, restaurants and lounge area are quite luxurious while maintaining the traditional flavor. Security is well done here with gates at the front that they close at night and 24/7 guards. Very strict about guests - be careful who you bring back from the bar. Breakfast is continental with omelet bar and traditional waffles. Gym is small and has basic items. Extremely helpful and polite staff, very talkative; bellhops wear the traditional outfit with the fez hat. Handful of parking spots on the street in front of the‚Ä¶"
 January 2014,5,The best hotel in Rabat!,"Luxury hotel with good location and nothing compares. the rooms are so modern and classy, comfortable and well maintained and the amenities are equally fantastic. Also, the food was excellent and the staff was very welcoming as well as very professional. We will definitely be staying again at Tour Hassan Rabat."

 January 2014,4,Another Gem!,"This hotel is definitely a gem you must consider. Arrival is under-whelming from the outside, until you walk through the front doors. Then you're overcome by the beauty. With no detail overlooked, the decor is luxurious-Moroccan, the grounds are beautiful and the staff friendly and inviting. The room was beautiful, modern, and immaculately clean. The food was also excellent, with excellent staff. Three complaints: (1) the neighboring construction at 7am- I'm not sure what the hotel can do about this; and (2) horrible internet access. This was a business trip and I couldn't get a connection strong enough to get on my workplace VPN. Sending and receiving e-mails took forever. Very frustrating. Because of that, I have them four stars. (3) It took four men about 20 minutes to find‚Ä¶"
 November 2013,5,On the revisit list!,"I have had excellent visits and meetings here. The staff are outstanding. It is unusual to have the hotel management floating out in the lobby ensuring that you are comfortable and have everything that you need. I am talking about the real ""line of authority"" managers, not simply customer service reps. Definitely on the list for repeat visits."
 January 2014,4,It's like staying in a ... Palace!,"Stayed in room 224 (garden view) while on business trip. Excellent hotel. The king size bed was super comfortable with high quality pristinely clean sheets. Lots of pillows (four on the bed with more in the closets) that were of different firmness, so you get to choose. The bathroom was large a functional (slightly dated in decor compared to the room decor, which seems to have been redone very recently). Nonetheless bathroom fully functional with nice shower with own-brand bathing products. Housecoat available, oddly no slippers... Hmmm... Excellent sound proofing. Free wifi available everywhere in the hotel, on different hubs - but once connected, each automatically loads without need to enter passwords. Beautiful view from room onto the garden. Breakfast was great! Fresh fruit‚Ä¶"
 November 2013,5,Tour Hassan - amazing place to be,"I had a business lunch in this hotel, I was pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff even those who were not in service in the restaurant where I was. I was curious to see the quality of the rooms and they offered me a tour of the entire property and I can say that it is a palace and not a hotel."
 January 2014,5,"Amazing!!! Perfect service, staff and hotel.","I'm travelling a lot, Tour Hassan is one of my favourite hotels in Morocco, I have a good memories and impressions regarding theirs services, hospitality, a very nice food and wonderful staff. Tour Hassan will be my reference hotel at Rabat, I will not hesitate to come back as soon as possible, and will say it to all my contacts!!!"
 July 2013,5,GOOD TRIP,"The location, the service, and the superior quality of TOUR HASSAN made our stay perfect. We are long time customers of these kind of Hotels and this one has moved to the top of our list of favorites. The hotel is visually beautiful, extremely well kept and clean, the service starting with the bellmen, to the front desk, to special requests and services we used, were excellent. We were on a freind trip to Rabat with dear friends...we all agreed the experience at the hotel, added to the beautiful memories we have from our two day stay. The rooms are beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable. Be sure to book your room here the next time you are in RABAT."
 October 2013,4,Wonderful Location and Grounds,"This hotel is well-located - walking distance to the center, the Medina, and is an oasis of calm in an otherwise busy area of town. The rooms were lovely - light and airy. Ask for a Garden view. The service was good. Excellent wi-fi and lots of public spaces for meeting. The only downside was that the breakfast, included in the room, was very mediocre. Lots of choices, but not always fresh. Otherwise, it was a good place to stay in Rabat."
 September 2013,4,Very Good Hotel,"Visited the hotel for few days last month. The staff is very competent, helpful and pleasant. Services provided for both rooms and meetings venues are very good. The price/quality ratio is also very good. To be recommended for sure."
 October 2013,5,Wonderful rooms and great food,Beautiful grounds and architecture made this hotel a treat. Rooms are good size with a nice bathroom. The atmosphere was very welcoming and the food was very good. Had both dinner and breakfast at the hotel. Enjoyed the stay here very much.
 October 2013,5,The best hotel in the world!,"I recently traveled to Morocco, a trip I had been planning for over a year. First I spent two weeks in southern Spain; then I took a ferry to Morocco and a train to Rabat where I planned to join a tour. I had not been in the Rabat train station for five minutes when my wallet, containing my passport, credit cards and money, was stolen. By the time I reached La Tour Hassan I was a wreck. My trip was ruined and I felt totally lost and alone. Early the next morning I was having breakfast of the beautiful patio near the pool when a handsome man approached my table and asked me how my stay was going. I proceeded to tearfully launch into my situation. This man, Abdellah Barigou,the hotel's Directeur D'exploitation, listened and offered his apologies that the theft had occurred in‚Ä¶"
 September 2013,4,Nice yet expensive,"I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights during a business trip to Rabat. although it is definitely an expensive hotel for the category, still I enjoyed my stay, room was spacious enough, staff is very helpful. free WiFi was strong in some areas and weak in others. Restaurant La Maison Arabe is a typical Moroccan restaurant where you should try oven baked Chiken (Tajine)"
 September 2013,5,Fabulous ... whether for personal travel or for a conference,"I travel on business all over North Africa and have stayed in most of the hotels in Rabat, but this hotel is my #1 selection for business conferences AND personal travel. It has a unique charm, is classically beautiful, but with all the amenities a modern traveller wants. Held a confernce for 70 and not one complaint out of the entire group ... the food was supurb, the service outstanding, and the staff always helpful, friendly and professional. I couldn't ask for more ... and all within an easy walk to sites and shopping."
 September 2013,3,Business hotel,"We stayed there just one night during our round trip through Marrocco. It is a tippical business hotel. The rooms are big and well equiped.We ate at the maroccain restaurant, which was good. This hotel is o.k. for one night to stay."
 October 2013,5,A great 5 star hotel,"I spent three nights at this wonderful 5 star hotel. Hotel room 215 was just great. I felt like a Prince in Morocco. The fine sheets, sweet smell of Arabian perfume, the great view from my hotel window and the wonderful continental breakfast. An experience i can never forget."
 September 2013,4,Nice and enjoyable hotel,"We spent only one night here on our tour of Morocco. The room was large, bed huge, and a good view over the pool area. Our package included dinner, and this limited our dining options to only one restaurant, but it was fine. Strangly, the gym only opened after 10 am. I'm more accustomed to use a gym much earlier."
 September 2013,5,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed here from 13 -20 September. The bedroom with garden view was first class, and the pool and garden seating area was superb. The food was good and the restaurant service was fast. However, the piano bar outside the seating area and the pool, sometimes had very slow service. One day it seemed like it was almost an hour for a drink to arrive to the pool, after I reminded the waiter. Although we were on holiday and did enjoy the hotel overall, I have to point out that it mainly caters for corporate events! This became clear one day when we were moved away from the pool area whilst sun bathing, in order to make way for tables, chairs, and TV cameras to be set up. The corporate events can sometimes be very noisy in the evening with volumes of people milling around, and‚Ä¶"
 September 2013,3,Seen better days,"This hotel has fantastic publicity material and when you arrive you are not disappointed. The public areas are impressive and the bedrooms are spacious, with comfortable beds. However you soon come across things that aren't quite what they should be. I found the staff to be generally very polite, but dozy; service was especially slow in the restaurant, although the food was excellent (when it finally arrived). The plumbing in my bathroom was temperamental. There is a gym, although all the equipment is ""very well worn""; but the strangest thing to me about the gym was that it didn't open until 10am. Normally I like to use the gym early, before breakfast, and judging by how crowded gyms can be in other hotels at this early hour there are many others who think the same. Maybe this‚Ä¶"
 September 2013,4,outstanding conference support,"I attended a conference at this hotel the week of 17 September and had a wonderful time. The conference support was amazing. The buffet breakfast and lunch had a wide variety of food, and the snacks provided during the morning and afternoon breaks were amazing. My room was very comfortable, air conditioning worked fine although the weather was mild. They surrounding area around the hotel isn't that wonderful for sightseeing but you are close to some of the major sights of Rabat and the hotel courtyard and interior decorations are worth spending some time in."
 August 2013,2,Does not live up to it's hype,The service is horrible for a 5* hotel. I have been to 3* star hotels with a better service. The staff just don't care here. If you ask for something it most likely will never come or will come after you no longer need it. The A/C in our room did not cool at all. Asked to have it checked but nothing was done. Asked for miscellaneous things but never happened. The basin was blocked with water. Had to repeatedly remind them but still it wasn't sorted. Checked out early because of all the pitfalls. Not recommended. Not coming back.
 November 2012,4,Well preserved old hotel,"I always ask to stay at Tour Hassan whether I'm in Rabat for business or pleasure. It is a wonderful place to feel the elegance of an old Moroccan hotel. Breakfast is magnificent and all of the restaurants have delicious, well priced, Moroccan dishes."
 July 2013,2,skip the bar,"I have been coming to Rabat every month for over two years....tonight I decided to visit the lounge for a glass of wine and read my book...waste of money....the glass of wine was shameful....i have been to this hotel before with mixed reviews....i asked for a wine list and they said it was ""house wine""....now I live in France and was expecting some sort of choice...I think I could have gotten a jug of wine and done better..it was stale and poor quality.... the two servers were behind the counter for over ten minutes talking and i had to go up to the bar to order.... it is a beautiful setting which is why i chose it to relax after working but turned out to be such a rip off for such a highly regarded hotel. If this is the quality of the beverage area I would suspect the level‚Ä¶"
 July 2013,4,Terrific Hotel in Town,"La Hassan is an excellent value for your travel dollar. The lobby is spacious, meticulous, and filled with Moroccan tile mosaic work. The staff is anxious to please and quickly resolves any issue. When my power convertaor failed during the trip, the front desk promptly provided me one at no charge. The hotel is gorgeous to walk through, particularly in the courtyard, which includes the pool area and seating for several of the restaurants. We enjoyed a well prepared, evenly paced meal sitting in the courtyard on a tranquil evening. If you need to sty in town while in Rabat, Tour Hassan is an excellent choice."
 May 2013,4,A great surprise,"During this business trip to Rabat, we were supposed to stay at the impressive Sofitel that, at time of writing, is considered as the #1 hotel in Rabat. Due to some last minute changes we were forced to choose another hotel and La Tour Hassan was what was assigned. Let me tell you that the hotel facade is very nice but the reception area nearby areas did not live up to the exterior design. However, when I took the lift up to the second floor where my room was located things started to look a lot better (strangely, room numbers do not seem to follow a sequential scheme but I did manage to find room 230). When I entered into the room, I was greeted by a nice large room with a great comfortable bed, an OK bath and sitting area. But what really did impress me was the view from the‚Ä¶"
 May 2013,5,Great Hotel and Excellent amenities,"La Tour Hassan and its well trained staff sure know how to please their high end Guests. Fancy toiletries, 5 stars Breakfast in bed are just the beginning when it comes to La tour Hassan hotel. It is indeed a superb hotel conveniently located. The experience was flawless from all aspects. What I loved the most is the Moroccan cuisine which is what i always look for when i land in Morocco. It will always be my first choice when i visit Morocco I just hope they will not be booked :)"
 April 2013,5,"location, location, location","I concur with all the positive reviews of this hotel -- room, food (breakfast and dinner buffets), staff, etc. all wonderful. What I loved best, however, was the location. Steps away from the hotel entrance I found a charming used book store. Despite my total lack of French and the owner's total lack of English, I ended up with one of my all-time favorite souvenirs -- an '89 edition of Robert Carrier's cookbook, ""Taste of Morocco."" Nearby was a fabulous flower market. Because I approached from the side, at first I thought the many lovely floral arrangements lined up at the curb were awaiting pickup for a special occasion. Then I turned the corner and found numerous vendors -- with one gorgeous arrangement after another -- turning the sidewalks into a botanical wonderland.‚Ä¶"
 May 2013,4,Second time in Rabat and MUCH happier at this hotel than the previous.,"The entire hotel smells wonderful. Service is hospitable, friendly, and reliable. Most of the staff speaks English which is very helpful. The spa service is nice but there aren't any changing rooms. The gym is minimal. There are some dumbbells and cardio equipment only. The food is very good and service is great for anyone who has any special dietary considerations. I'm a holistic health professional and eating hear was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this hotel to other people traveling for either business or pleasure."
 May 2013,1,"Average food, appalling service","The Moroccan restaurant offers a classic choice of traditional food. Unfortunately, every single one of the specials have to be ordered 24 hours in advance and for a minimum of four people. What was on offer was at best average, and certainly not worth the high prices asked. The bread, a staple of Moroccan food, was all stale and dry. Before the meal I was ignored by the occasional passing waiter for twenty minutes. In the restaurant, waiting staff were also invisible for the entire meal, leaving drinks to run out, and us waiting excessively long periods for food. There are many restaurants in Rabat that offer superior food at far more reasonable prices."
 April 2013,5,Exquisite Riad with wonderful food,Loved this Riad -- our first in Morocco. Beautifully appointed with excellent service and startlingly good food for dinner and again for breakfast. Very nice wine selection. Sorry we weren't staying longer!
 April 2013,4,WOW!!,"Beautiful hotel set close to the Medina. The pool and gardens were simply beautiful. Our room was very large, and very nicely furnished. The breakfast buffet was delicious with a very nice variety. We feel fortunate to have stayed in this hotel."
 April 2013,5,"Lovely hotel, well located","We stayed here as part of a group tour. Dating to 1914, the 140 room hotel is Rabat's last surviving hotel to be constructed using traditional Moorish-Andalusian design. Good wifi (unusual for Morocco), lovely rooms and good food. Located close to the medina. Excellent buffet breakfast."
 February 2013,3,Nice Hotel Near Medina,"I stayed at this hotel for several weeks while conducting business in Rabat. In fairness, this was my first trip to Rabat and my first stay in a Moroccan hotel. A nice hotel that is within walking distance to the Medina (the Old City) and close to plenty of shopping and restaurants. The hotel is clean and looks quite nice, with Moroccan motif throughout. Many members of the staff were nice and pleasant, others, not so much. My room was nice and the large bed, especially comfortable. The furniture in the room, 2 small/small chairs and a sofa, looked nice, but were not comfortable at all. A larger desk chair provided some comfort, but lying in bed was the only real option to feel relaxed. By-the-way, they had the same small uncomfortable chairs and sofas in the lobby. I gave up on‚Ä¶"
 March 2013,4,"Beautiful hotel, good service","A beautiful, well maintained hotel in old Rabat. Lovely pool area and gardens, and good location. Ate dinner at the hotel, the food was not very special. However the breakfast buffet was excellent, with many choices, including an omelet station."
 February 2013,4,Beautiful Traditional Hotel in Rabat,"Great location (close to mainnstation and medina), well kept and clean, amazing traditional architecture and decoration. Breakfast was included and was excellent. Pool area and gardens very pretty, although it rained the whole time I was there so never used it :-( Only downside was the gym.....the equipment was either broken or not working properly......... The restaurants looked good and were recomended but a little pricey compared to what is nearby.....but maybe worth the splurhge if you have never had Moroccan food."
 March 2013,3,Not what I expected.,Just spent three nights here for work and I'm not sure I'd stay here again. The one desk clerk I was dealing with on day one was a little too surly. I came back down telling him my AC was not working and my room was hot. I was very friendly and looking for help. Twice over the day he said he would tell the right person. Finally someone came up and told me the AC has not been turned on yet for the hotel due to the cooler weather they were still experiencing. I have never seen this in what's supposed to be a nice hotel. Why the desk clerk could not tell me this I don't know. By this point he was pretty cool towards me for the rest of my stay. The other employees were nice and professional. The rooms my partner and I had were small and overlooked a pretty ugly courtyard‚Ä¶
 October 2012,5,Excellent Hotel and Service,The hotel is very beautiful! It is a renovated old traditional Moroccan palace that has a very serene atmosphere. The location is perfect and the greenery is very relaxing. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The Moroccan restaurant at this hotel offers great food at a not so high price. The staff are very friendly; ALL of them!
 December 2011,4,Traditional moroccan hotel,"I had several occasion to stay at this hotel (about 4 times) always for business purposes, but it is always a great pleasure to stay there. The staff is really friendly, the gardens and swiming pool are a glimpse of heaven! Another good thing about this hotel, is that it is walking distance from the Medina and the souk. The restaurant of traditionnal moroccan food is as well highly recommended."
 October 2012,5,Great hotel!,"The hotel was great. We stayed only for 1 night. The rooms was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was also big and clean. The bed was really comfortable. The dinner and breakfast were very reach, the buffet had almost everything for the different tastes. It was very delicious and good. The garden was very quiet and beautiful in the evening. Our stay there was great."
 October 2012,3,"Good location, comfortable bed, but overpriced","I stayed for four days last week in superior room. Room was clean, quiet and comfortable. The staff were not so friendly, we had to beg for simple things such as a bottle of water. Internet should be a standard inclusion at a hotel charging such rates. Late checkout was a problem, but the lady chef at breakfast cooked the perfect omelet. I won't stay there again, there is better value close by."
 September 2012,3,Be a little careful out there,"I stayed in the Hotel for a conference. Service was very good, rooms clean and nice, no real swimming pool to speak of and a basic gym. Food was OK but not great. French is the preferred language but you can get by easily enough on English. as for Rabat its not a place I would recommend again. For an African city its pretty clean but still is quite dangerous particularly if you wander about solo. Be warned also the local favourite sport is fleecing or robbing tourists. Negotiate everything before you buy whether its a tour guide or a taxi. Two taxi rides to and from the hotel cost 800% difference. Anyway there you go - the hotel is absolutely fine but not cheap, go if you like as Morocco is interesting but not to relax."
 August 2012,4,First Rate!,"Room: Outstanding! Firm bed (no backache, for once!), bathroom restocked daily. Breakfast: Many, many choices. Don't miss this. Courtyard: Nicely shaded with excellent staff attention. Gym: Cardio equipment. Very small stock of free weights Spa: Looks very good, but I did not take advantage of this Pool: Clean and clear"
 June 2012,5,Excellent hotel in Downtown Rabat,"This hotel is a real gem in downtown Rabat with excellent restaurants, bar and a beautiful pool. The courtyard style hotel has a beautiful garden that is very well maintained. The staff are friendly and courteous and keep the premises super clean. This hotel is more expensive than the other hotels in the area but well worth the extra money. Nearby, within walking distance, is the souk (marketplace) as well as the beach (Atlantic Ocean). Also, the world famous La Tour Hassan (Tower) is within walking distance. Knowledge of French and/or Arabic is essential to move around in the city unless you have a guide with you. Rabat is a beautiful city but does not get many tourists as they generally visit Marrakech, Casablanca and Fez. Strongly recommend staying here if your travels take‚Ä¶"
 May 2012,4,Great Moroccan atmosphere,"Lovely hotel that makes you know you are in Morocco with very comfortable rooms. Pleasant outlook onto central courtyard with pool and gardens. Were here on a tour so I'm not sure how expensive it might be, but it was certainly a great place to stay. Meals were about the best we had in the country as the buffet was more extensive and tastier than most."
 June 2012,4,Clean and attentive,"This is my first time to travel in Africa, so I don't have anything to compare this hotel to. However, I have to say, the staff is constantly cleaning, which is very evident as you walk around the hotel and is more than can be said for many nicer U.S. hotels. Additionally, the breakfast was abundant, varied, and quite delicious. I always found the staff to be very attentive and courteous, with the majority speaking very good English. The pool and gym are very nice, as well."
 June 2012,5,"Plush, gorgeous and kind","We just had a conference at the Tour Hassan and participants were univerally pleased with the facility. On our evaluation form out of a four point scale, one participant rated the hotel one million! The bedrooms were comfortable and well appointed. The meeting rooms were pleasant. Everything worked! The coffee breaks with the array of Moroccan pastries from the local patisserie were irresistable. The lunch buffet was sumptuous with lots of vegetable choices. And the grounds and decor were palatial. And the staff were all very courteous and helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel for business functions."
 June 2012,3,Nickled and dimed,"I felt nickled and dimed at this hotel. From what I understand, the room rates are not low (I was there for work so I don't know what the rate was), yet .... in the three nights I was there the hotel provided just one small bottle of water (by comparison my next hotel in Morocco provided unlimited water bottles for free); internet was extremely expensive; and the price we were charged for the not very good pre-fixe dinner was highway robbery! The rest of the food for the conference was better than the pre-fixe dinner, but nothing to write home about. The rooms were fine, clean, well-appointed-- although I wondered why they hadn't replaced the toiled seat in my room - it looked like someone had burned it with a cigarette or something. The central courtyard and other‚Ä¶"
 May 2012,4,Quite good but very expensive,"This is a fine hotel if somebody else (you company?) pays. The rooms are medium-large, the beds very good, generally, the decoration quite stylish (and sober), with no particular view. You get an inside court with a good swimming pool. Breakfast is adequate but very expensive (20 Euros). Wifi Internet is available, for a moderate price if you stay some time, but with some breakdowns. The location is quite central, close to the Tour (obviously) and from the main restaurants. The hotel has some charm, as it is now 100 years old. However, the price looks quite high to me"
 May 2012,2,Simply overrated,"I have travelled several times to Rabat and this time I chose this hotel on a business trip. The high room rate was not at all compensated by the service. My room was literally few meters above the noisy hotel‚Äôs outdoor bar and a playing band (!). I managed to have it changed after some discussion. Room service took a long time and some items were just forgotten. Internet connection was extremely expensive and very slow, and this is something difficult to accept when you pay a lot for your room and you are on a business trip. At the checkout my explanations were just unheard. Breakfast was standard, nothing more. The hotel is in a nice historic building, with fine details. However here we are reviewing a hotel a not a museum, hence the overall rate is just very disappointing."
 April 2012,4,Great decor but a bit noisy,"The lobby and overall decor are wonderful. Restaurants are superb, though wine prices high (as they are in all hotels in Morocco) - can avoid this by purchasing wine at neighborhood store for 1/10 price - right up hill 1/2 block to 1st street on right and 1/2 block to 'hole in wall' liquor store on right. Location is good - mile walk to tour Hassan or to Medina. Room noisy as construction was in progress on north side of hotel. Also found carpet a bit dirty, but room adequate. Pool small but in lovely setting."
 January 2012,5,i love the place and the people,i came to rabat from los angeles i have being around the world in to many nice hotels but to be honest i never seing something like this specific hotel OMG the people the food the rooms were stunning i strongly advice you to stay there you'll have a blast I HAD A GREAT TIME IN MOROCCO specially in rabat i'll defenetlly go back again its something amazing mimi- los angeles CA
 March 2012,4,Excellent h√¥tel √† Rabat,"I spent 3 nights at La Tour Hassan H√¥tel: nice and clean. Great large rooms. Beautiful garden. Well located with kind staff. Good breakfast. Maybe not the best in town, but a very good choice to stay in Rabat, secure international accommodation standards and get good access to the city. I recommand this hotel."
 March 2012,1,Worst 5* Hotel EVER,"How did this hotel got rated as a five star is beyond me. I got the sense from the staff as if they were paying me not the other way around. I certainly did not get a value for my money. There was a mix up from the agency with my booking (not the hotel fault) and my checking in was delayed, at that time, I was treated as if I was conning them into staying. Furthermore, where most hotels offer free net access, this hotel charges an absurd amount of money for access, the list is long, but really a bad experience, in comparison to a wonderful Riyad I stayed at earlier."
 February 2012,4,Great hotel!!,"La Tour Hassan is a great hotel. The room was great, modern, comfortable, nicely decorated and large. It is also conveniently located. The room is overpriced though compared to other hotels of this class in Morocco. The food is also overpriced for the portions you get. The breakfast buffet is very good though expensive. The hotel had nice attentions like sweets and a fruit basket upon arrival. The only downside is that service is poor. Reception staff are a bit rude and not very helpful. While there, it has happened to me to just stand there while the woman behind the desk is ignoring me completely and doing something on her computer. Not the kind of service one would expect from such an upscale hotel. Still, good experience overall."
 February 2012,4,Not All Change is Progress,"You've got to admire the ownership of La Tour Hassan for trying to refurbish and upgrade the hotel. However, like I mentioned in my title, not all change is progress. To be quite frank, I do not like the changes. While the old red, gold and white decor was homey and warm, the new red, black, and gray scheme is nothing but cold and clinical. Nowhere can the difference be more telling that the floor where I stayed for a week. One half was new (my side) and the other half was old, making for some pretty definite contrast. In addition, the finishers forgot a few things in the new rooms, like cleaning up white paint in the new carpet and glue in the bathroom tiles. Also, unless you have a garden view, the view from the big windows is horrendous, just a massive, dirty‚Ä¶"
 February 2011,1,Paid Twice!,"As part of a 4-weeks vacation in Madrid, Morocco and Jordan, the first stop on our drive around Morocco was La Tour Hassan, pre-booked and pre-paid on October 30, 2010 through an Internet hotel booking group, Met Global (confirmation #126153 136). (This was unusual for me as I normally make reservations directly with hotels and pay upon departure.) I duly presented my Met Global voucher at check-in, on February 1. On February 3, an invoice for some $700 was presented to me at check-out. Unfortunately, I forgot that I had already paid Met Global USD692, so I absent-mindedly paid again. Almost a year later, in spite of many emails to Met Global and La Tour Hassan, the response from both has been zero. The hotel is nothing to write home about and much of its service was not‚Ä¶"
 October 2011,4,Good but the construction starts early,"The hotel is exceedingly charming. More charming than most high end hotels. The rooms vary dramatically in size. be sure to ask about the size of the room. Also, the key fobs are hilariously large. It really is silly. The gardens and pool area are great, and the common areas are very pleasant. The restaurants are very nice, and my dinner at the Brassiere was nice but expensive. The service was great though. Internet was weak and unstable. For some reason it worked better in the gardens. Plus, it was quite expensive for 24 hours. Just something to be aware of. The big issue is that my room faced the construction next door and by 7 am, the workers were banging around and working. if you rise before then, then it really isn't a problem, but I do not."
 October 2011,5,Great Moroccan hotel,"The hotel has a good location and affords the traveler a great Moroccan style space in which to stay. The gardens for breakfast or relaxing in in the evening are very nice. My room overlooked the gardens so that made it especially nice. Hotel had a good wireless setup, but it required getting a renewal on a 24 hour basis, but it was easy by stopping by the desk. Staff was friendly and English communications was easy."
 September 2011,3,"Fabulous public areas, but becareful about your room!","Stayed at this hotel for two nights, then moved. My colleague and I compared notes and we both thought that the rooms were too small, nowhere to plug our devices (laptop, phones, etc.) and a dismal view. When I actually saw each other's rooms we laughed -- she thought hers was small but mine was about 75% as big. The bed filled up all the space, and the passage between the foot of the bed and the small CRT TV was maybe 35 cm. The closet, along the side of the bed, had a door that couldn't open fully because it hit a lampshade. And, on each of the available surfaces, which were not many, there were pretty little tchotchkes, such as little ceramic dishes, potpourri, etc. The bathroom had a lot of floor space, though, if that's what you like. I will say the bed was comfortable,‚Ä¶"
 October 2010,4,This hotel is a picture perfect postcard of Morocco,"I've always wanted to come to Morocco and when I finally did, decided to do a tour of a few weeks around the country, in July 2010. In Rabat, we stayed in La Tour Hassan. I must say the hotel is like a postcard from a movie, very pretty and very ""Moroccan"", the architecture is great, the garden and the pool - lovely, the restaurants, stunning. I have to say it was one of the prettiest hotels I stayed in for the duration of my trip around Morocco. The room was great - though we had to swap, as the first one didn't have satisfactory air conditioning, besides that, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to have a good quality stay with a pool and gym and good breakfast."
 June 2011,5,Beautiful hotel with wonderful service,I stayed here for a week in June 2011 and was overwhelmed by the staff and beauty of the hotel. The pool is gorgeous and there are many restaurants on site that serve all sorts of delicious and traditional (along with non-traditional) Moroccan foods. The spa is very nice as well. Great location. No complaints.
 April 2011,4,Warm Moroccan hospitality - but watch out for the construction noise,"I stayed here for about a week as part of a business group of about 2 dozen people. This hotel highlights the friendly and warm character of the Moroccan people. Service was excellent‚Äîthe staff at the front was friendly, informative, and accommodating. They are the key reason to recommend this hotel. Another nice aspect is the lovely garden area. The room size was adequate, room lighting was good, and the bathroom was modern, clean, and well lit. The d√©cor was ever so slightly shabby. The biggest complaint I have is that one whole side of the hotel faces a large construction site‚Äîand the hotel doesn‚Äôt have soundproofed windows. Consequently if you do have a room facing the construction zone, it will be almost unbearably noisy from about 9:30 a.m. until about 6:30 p.m. ‚Ä¶"
 April 2011,3,"Great location, a bit shabby, friendly but uneven service","Located in the center city La Tour Hassan is just a short walk away from the souk and other sites. It has a lovely garden and pool, good to relax after work. The hotel has undergone some renovations but the rooms are still a bit shabby with air conditioning that rattles loudly. Staff are friendly but not always competent. Ordering drinks in the lounge one time came with a lovely tray full of nuts, olives, chips, the next day with nothing. Wifi works well everywhere but is costly. All meals are pricy and the breakfast buffet is not worth it. But there are coffee shops and restaurants in short walking distance. Especially good is the Come Back restaurant next door - excellent itallian cuisine."
 March 2011,4,One of the better hotels in Rabat,"Nice hotel not far from the city center. For Europe standards it would have 4 stars. Beautiful lobby. Nice garden and swimming-pool. Rooms are not big but very clean and nice. Breakfast is good wirh a lot of choice. Restaurants give good quality but are expensive. Personal is helpfull. Comparing to the other hotels in Rabat, The Tour Hassan is one of the best."
 February 2011,1,Avoid by all means,"When we arrived at the entrance by taxi, the door men didn't move a finger, they were just standing there watching us. We went inside carrying our luggages and through a meaningless metal detector gate, which no one is around to check and goes off every time someone walk through. The lobby is big but not stylish, the lighting was too bright and white (which they turn off completely during the night to make the whole lobby pitch-dark). The room was ok but there wasn't even a bottle of complimentary water, no kettle or tea bags, only an expensive mini bar and a basket of expensive snacks. Had only one pillow for each bed and each one had different stuffing inside. One too stuffed and hard and the other one too soft and with strange bumpy shapes inside. The booklet in the room‚Ä¶"
 January 2011,5,great attention to service,"It is not easy to find an hotel that melt style, quality and great attention to service, but la tour Hassan has all of these qualities! Great environment, nice antiques in all the area of the hotel, extremely nice garden, great food and above all refined service, in few words all that you need to enjoy the town!!"
 October 2010,4,An elegant hotel that lives up to expectations,"I enjoyed my stay at La Tour Hassan. My room was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. I found the service to be very professional, courteous, and responsive. The buffet spreads are exceptional -- yum. The property is beautiful: a courtyard with attractive pool and lounges, a delightful garden for strolling, and a spa/hammam. The hotel smells good too; there seem to be fragrances and potpourris used in all the halls and passages. Wi-fi internet fees run approximately $10 per day or a slightly more expensive flat fee for the entire stay, or one can pay per use in the business center. There's a mini market around the corner (exit left, then left around the corner), where you can supply yourself with 1.5L bottles of water much more economically (~5dh) than the mini-bar."
 June 2010,3,"Fine - no more, no less","Overall, this hotel was nice, clean and in a good location. My room was very small and internet was very expensive - although the hotel could not agree about rates. It has a nice pool, with very cold water, and nice landscaping. It has a very small gym and a very expensive spa. They did a good job printing schedules for the World Cup and showing all the games. Food was ok overall but the buffet breakfast was great. It's in a good location, walking distance to the train and medina. My biggest issue was service. While the staff was very kind, they often contradicted each other and gave wrong information."
 February 2010,3,A bit tired and under renovation,"I stayed in this hotel on a business trip to Rabat. The hotel is a bit tired 5* and poor value for the money in my opinion. More expensive than other similar or better hotels in Rabat and no complimentary Internet or breakfast. It is undergoing some renovations and for example the fitness room / gym is closed. - Thomas, Spain"

 September 2009,3,Better than I expected,"Having read the previous reviews for this hotel I was expecting something alot worse than we got. Actually the hotel was good in my opinion. I have stayed on 4-5* hotels and although this one was a little different in its appearance it was not a bad stay at all. The room was large and comfortable, the decor is very Moroccan which for some people would be too dark but was all part of the experience for us. We had complimentary water and fruit bowl in the room and some biscuity type things. The bathroom was clean although I did spot a few cracks around the bath which other reviwers had picked up on. We ate in the hotel for breakfast. Good selection, continental, fruit and hot selection. We also had lunch in the hotel and although the service was terribly slow the club sandwich and‚Ä¶"
 July 2009,3,Good but not outstanding,"The Tour Hassan has a excellent location, and that is about it. Food is mediocre, at best, and during my best, many facilities were being renovated."
 March 2009,4,Good experience,"I've spent one night in this hotel, and was a positive experience. The bar close to the swimming pool is very welcoming, and the Moroccan restaurant is OK. I found brakfast poor, not much selection, disappointing. It let down the hotel. The room was nice, spacious. Internet connection not very easy. Friendly staff. On overall, I would go back if in the city."
 February 2009,2,"Overpriced, poor service","I stay in the Tour Hassan on business, and because they know that my bill is paid by someone else, they have started trying to pad it with additional charges. Last time I got internet access included for free, this time I can have it for free if I use a cable (obviously there isn't one!) but have to pay for wireless. When I queried this, they said that it didn't matter as I wasn't paying the bill myself. That sums up this place! They rely on business travelers, and service is erratic and often unhelpful. It is also extraordinarily overpriced!! There have to be better options in Rabat!"
 June 2008,3,Disappointing Stay,"Stayed three nights at the La Tour Hassan during a two week tour of Morocco. Reviews were right about the hotel, as it is certainly not a five star or really even a solid four. If you must stay downtown, then it is worth considering if you know not to expect much for the amount charged. It looked like the nicer downtown option, but I would suggest going to the Hilton for more modern services and updated surroundings. The rooms were very tired and desperately in need of an over haul. The Internet did not work in the hotel, even though it was promised. Several times the front desk gave excuses for this and said it would be back on momentarily. It never worked correctly. Also, meal options were limited in the hotel. Decided to just order room service, but we had lots of‚Ä¶"
 May 2008,4,reasonable hotel but no 5 stars,"Slept one night during a roundtrip around the King cities. Hotel could use a overhaul to modernize. Rooms are OK but nothing special. Sitting in the 'enlosed garden' on the first floor near the small pool is nice but nothing special. Reasonable hotel for business or short stay for tourists for max 1 or 2 nights. Staff was pleasant. TV reception was lousy- and the problem was in the hotel cable system (even the digital satelite channels suffered from snow and noise - not expected in a 3 star hotel, let alone a 5 star."
 November 2007,3,OK But Not Fabulous,"I stayed five nights at the Tour Hassan in November 2007 while I was in Rabat on a business trip. The exterior of the hotel is impressive, the lobby decor is gorgeous classic Moroccan tilework, and the desk service is very friendly. The buffet breakfast was excellent with good service, and the dining room looked out onto beautiful courtyard/garden vistas. However, the rooms were not quite as opulent. My room was very small with a view onto a dirty rooftop. There were numerous stray hairs on the sink and floor in my bathroom after first checking in (most disconcertingly -- a stranger's black, curly hair right in the middle of the ""clean"" bidet... the horror!). The carpet in less accessible areas of the main room also did not appear to have been vacuumed any time‚Ä¶"
 October 2007,2,Tired,"I visited this hotel for a work conference. Some of the hotel (the pool, the bar, the spa and reception for example) are very modern and worthy of a stay. Much of the hotel (the main restaurant and the rooms) are very tired and in need of an overhaul. The food in the main dining room was very average (but if I went as a tourist I would go out to eat every night to see Rabat) and the room poor. The toilet seat was cracked; the air con did not work; the towels were grey and worst of all, each morning at 1:30 the bins were emptied into a lorry waking up the entire wing. Some colleagues asked to be moved and the staff were very accomodating. Other colleagues had rooms in different parts of the hotel and they were modern, clean and quiet. Maybe you;ll be lucky and end up in one‚Ä¶"
 September 2006,4,"Good Location, Good Experience","I arrived at La Tour Hassan after flying into Casablanca and driving the 1 1/2 hours north to Rabat. Though I tried to get detailed driving directions prior to my arrival, it was still difficult to find the hotel. The hotel should have a website (I wasn't able to find it) and they should provide a good map when requested. They faxed me something prior to arrival that was useless. There are no roadsigns in Rabat (or in Morocco for that matter). Once there, all was great. The concierge took care of my car. The check in was great. The room overlooked the Andalusian gardens, the restaurants were great -- especially the Moroccan ""La Maison Arabe"". The staff was friendly and the hotel was located in walking distance to the medina, the Tour Hassan, and the Chellah too! The‚Ä¶"
 January 2006,4,Old charm,"I've been coming to Rabat on business for 20 years. These days I tend to split my hotel time between the Villa Mandarine, for its exquisite ""eye candy"" -- textiles, color, decor -- and its fabulous modern cuisine, and the Tour Hassan. TH rooms are old world comfortable, warm (it's cold in Rabat this winter!), and all are now connected via WiFi (free). The service is quite friendly. And the hotel is located downtown within walking distance of tourist sights and best of all, the medina. But the real reason to stay here is that the Tour Hassan's Moroccan restaurant is simply fantastic. For those of you looking for tagines and briouats and couscous to die for, it's hard to find great Moroccan food outside of private homes in Rabat. The Tour Hassan dinner experience in a beautifully‚Ä¶"
