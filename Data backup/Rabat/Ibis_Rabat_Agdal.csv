 November 2022,5,Great place and friendly staff!,A beautiful riad in the medina with very friendly staff. Good breakfast and restaurant and large rooftop area with a small swimmingpool and a view over Rabat. Highly recommended for a stay in Rabat!
 December 2022,5,Dar Sháan the beautiful,"An absolutely amazing experience in this peaceful, cosy, clean and beautiful Medina Villa with a perfect location in Rabat. This wonderful place had all the comfortabilities you can expect and it was very price worthy. The staff is very friendly and helpful in all ways. The breakfast was really good with very nice omelettes. I would recommmend to update the WiFi as it was a little slow and irregular. Furthermore, if you can offer some tourist maps it would even be better than five stars :-) But overall, we would not hesitate one second to stay with you again. We will definetly recommend you to our friends and colleagues. Best regards/"
 October 2022,5,Sophisticated Riad,"They even had an elevator to the rooftop pool! This place was much like a European B&B. Bathrooms were a bit fancy. Food was also ""a step up"" from some of the other places we had stayed. Locations was also very good, as they were right by the gate. Staff went out of their way to arrange an extra bed for us and also arranged our transport to Casablanca. Highly recommended."
 November 2022,5,Wonderful stay in Rabat!,Dar Shaan is an amazing riad. It's beautiful and the service is terrific. The staff arranged airport transfers for us to and from the Casablanca airport. This made our travel so easy. We had dinner here and the food was top notch! Don't miss the loaves at breakfast. They're delicious! I would highly recommend Dar Shaan. I loved my stay here.
 October 2022,2,Not nearly as good as the rating leads you to believe.,"Out of all the Riads we stayed in during our two weeks in Morroco, this was the worst. It had tiny rooms, wasn’t very clean, to the point we requested a cleanup before using it. I suspect ratings are rigged. It couldn’t be that out of over one hundred reviews, this is the only one with low ratings."
 November 2022,5,"Luxurious, modern yet traditional Riad in the heart of Rabat - absolutely perfect for a quick getaway!","We visit Morocco on an annual basis from London, UK, and this time we opted to stay in a Riad for a change for a more unique experience and this Riad did not disappoint. The best way I can describe it that it felt 'boujee' luxurious in the feel of the place and felt modern while still keeping a traditional feel throughout the property, very well kept. The bedroom was a good size, comfortable bed, and good clean bathroom with good pressure on the shower, makes all the difference! We needed directions to a local mosque and prayers times, all of which the young man readily helped us with, thank you Sedik at reception! Also Fatine made reservations for our evening dinner at 'Dinarjaat' which was a couple of minutes walk from the Riad, again she was really helpful and happy to help.…"
 September 2022,5,What a welcome to Morocco!,We arrived late at night and it was our first stop. We were totally excited to find ourselves in this beautiful riad which has both a sense of history and modern design. The staff were very welcoming and even served us dinner at 11pm at night. Sadly we had to leave the next morning and couldn't enjoy the beautiful courtyard or rooftop swimming pool. Would love to back to Rabat and would definitely stay at Dar Shaan.
 October 2022,5,"Idyllic Accommodation, Excellent Location","We LOVED this riad, which is located inside the medina yet easily found and with superb accessibility. The property is very tastefully renovated in ‘modern Moroccan’ style, with cozy sitting areas throughout. The rooms are all uniquely furnished and accessorized - like being in a home decor magazine! They offer a very nice breakfast in a lovely dining room, and the staff couldn’t be nicer or more helpful. In particular, Sadeek shared great recommendations for shopping, sights and getting around Rabat. We will most definitely stay here again on return trip, as this property really helped make our visit to Rabat memorable."
 September 2022,5,Fantastic Riad,Location is only about 5 minutes walk to beach. Central in Medina but still the rooms are very quiet Staff are excellent. Very friendly and great service The room was fantastic. Unique decorations clean. Plenty of space. Great amenities Not good if you struggle with stairs as bathroom was on a mezzanine floor. I would highly recommend this Riad.
 October 2021,5,"Amazing staff, fantastic rooms and terrific location!","Loved our week here - everyone bent over backwards to make sure we had a wonderful time...it is always the staff that make the stay...and they were terrific. Plus awesome food, breakfast and dinner, wonderful room (quiet). Great place in the Medina...will definitely stay again!"
