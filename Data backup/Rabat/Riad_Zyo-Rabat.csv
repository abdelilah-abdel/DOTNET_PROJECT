 January 2023,5,Comfortable room and 5 stars bathroom,"Very nice riad, a mix of tradition and modern design. Very kind people, excellent breakfast and service. Very convenient location in the Medina and very close to the seaside for a breathetaking sunset, and very close to Oudaya Kasbah"
 December 2022,5,Beautiful Riad!,"Beautiful little Riad! The staff was so accommodating! They informed us of an app to order pizza delivery at night. The next morning, they set up a delicious breakfast for my family that consisted of fresh juice, fried eggs, pomegranate, and assortment of breads."
 December 2022,5,Riad Zyo is a perfect hotel,Zyo is a beautifully designed boutique hotel with large rooms and modern bathroom. Designed and decorated in a modern way with traditional nuances. Beautiful courtyard with a lovel small pool. Food was the best we have had in Morocco. Service was impeccable. Loved it all!
 November 2022,5,Perfect in every way (with kind and honest staff!),"This Riad is amazing. Beautiful and well located. I rarely write reviews, but the food and service were spectacular and so I felt I had to. My husband is vegan, I am not, and they made us his-and-her taglines for dinner, both were incredible. As for breakfast, normally I skip it, but this was one of the best breakfasts I have had (see photo, they also offered eggs but I was not hungry enough to have them). In terms of service, everyone was kind and lovely. What stood out the most was when my husband and I checked out three mornings ago, we forgot our wallets and passports in the safe. We were two blocks away and the front desk person came running after us with our wallets and passports. This could have been disastrous, but he was so honest and literally saved our trip. …"
 October 2022,5,Beautiful Spot Near Edge of Medina,"A sweet spot just inside the Rabat medina, we found this place welcoming and elegant. The room was large, and gave us room to manage our bags without using the bed. While the medina can be a noisy place, window shutters definitely make for easier sleeping. The host provided us with a great dinner recommendation (Dar Naji) about a 10 minute walk from the riad, breakfast tasty and plentiful."
 November 2022,5,Wow,"This is a beautiful and modern riad. No simple spartan aesthetic here. The lobby and seating area right away let you know you’re in for a treat. The roof is pretty and spacious. And the rooms was so amazing we were taking photos of it. Huge modern bathroom with 2 toilets. A shower that looked like it was from a Manhattan penthouse. High ceilings, gorgeous tile work, carvings, and beautiful wood door and window slats. Helpful staff. Would I have preferred to not be on the ground floor, yes bc the windows open onto the area off the lobby where everyone walks and there is no view of the outdoors, but that’s probably the room type our tour company selected. Still, the room was quiet despite a loud outdoor party happening next door. Very tasty breakfast and location is convenient…"
 August 2022,5,Gorgeous Riad,A beautiful Riad that showcases local artist’s work. The owner was welcoming and spent time chatting to us about his Riad. His pride for it showed through. The pool area was gorgeous and the rooms vibrant and unique. Our breakfast was very tasty. The staff were wonderful. A fabulous stay.
 October 2022,5,Fantastically and unexpectedly modern!,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, this Riad is a really a modern hidden gem in the heart of the the old Medina. From the moment we entered we were blown away by the beauty and simplicity of this riad. The initial bedrooms we had in the main floor riad were spectacular, but due to an electricity issue on the main floor were accommodated on the 2nd floor with two separate rooms. Both rooms were very modern and very well furnished. We had everything we needed and the beds were very clean and comfortable. The riad overall was very quiet and they had a wonderful quaint rooftop. Breakfast was very well presented and tasty-everything seemed to be a work of art! Although we only stayed one night, I would highly recommend this place based on its overall location and services…"
 October 2022,5,Wonderful riad,"Excellent all around. Beautiful room, clean, location, quaint. We loved the breakfast and all the art. Staff were very very helpful and friendly. Rooms were very quiet. We would recommend this riad to everyone. So location was right in the center of the old city and we saw several women walking alone at night so it felt very safe."
 September 2022,5,Oasis in the Rabat medina!,"A beautiful and charming place to stay. Quite an oasis amid the hustle and bustle of the Rabat mednia. Walking through the door, you step into a tranquil courtyard with a sparkling plunge pool. Mohammed greated us with cookies and some mint tea. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Some are in the ""new"" building that sits on the site of the old post office, and some in the attached riad that has been throughly and lovingly renovated, that dates back to the 14th century. We met the owner, Ali, who showed us his photo album of the before-during-and-after photos of the renovation. Breakfast each day was more than ample and delicious, Mohammed, Hamza and the rest of the staff couldn't have been more accomodating."

 October 2022,5,Lovely Riad inside the Medina in Rabat. A place you must experience!,"From the moment we walked into this beautiful riad we felt like we were at home. We were welcomed by the some delicious cookies and the traditional Moroccan Mjnt tea. The details in de orating this location was wonderful. Our room was beautiful with a comfortable bed and large bathroom. Our breakfast the following morning was Exceptional. If your planing on staying in Rabat this is the place to come too. The owner was kind and helpful and directed us to a lovely restaurant outside the Medina . If you want to experience Morocco you need to stay in the Medina. We loved our stay here and the staff was so accommodating. Thank you for,a wonderful experience!"
 September 2022,5,Great location,"Food is great, service amazing, location is perfect. We had a really nice experience at this riad! I loved the proximity to the restaurants and the shoreline. It is close to all the fun parts but tacked away from the hussle of the city noise."
 August 2022,5,Fabulous choice in Rabat!,"What a wonderful welcome to Morocco after a long flight from the US! After a delicious dinner, the owner gave us a tour of his careful restoration of the historic building and the gallery of local artists’ work. Everyone was friendly and helpful and the accommodations lovely and comfortable. The bathroom and shower were especially nice. I highly recommend this choice in Rabat!"
 August 2022,5,"Stunning, peaceful, ideal for art lovers","Absolutely stunning riad and the owner is so incredibly lovely. Showed us around the villa and was incredibly knowledgeable about art. He makes a point to showcase art throughout the property of up and coming Moroccan artists, which is so lovely and the art is stunning. Most peaceful little oasis, the most beautiful place we visited in Rabat and were lucky enough to stay here!"
 July 2022,4,A Modern Twist,"Great location near the medina. All the charm expected of a Moroccan riad, but with a modern twist. The decor is contemporary and modern compared to the more traditional decor seen in most riads. Hospitable staff. Mint tea and pastries to welcome you upon arrival. I was allowed to choose between the room I had reserved and another that was unoccupied. I appreciate being given that choice, because I actually chose the other unoccupied room. Both rooms were comfortably furnished. However, the room I chose was more spacious with better natural lighting. The food was good. My only issue was noise. It was quite loud with children laughing and playing late into the night. It was my first day in Morocco. Despite being exhausted after 25 hours of international travel, I could not…"
 May 2022,5,Beautiful Riad in Beautiful City,"A elegantly designed, smartly organized, well run and perfectly located riad with a gracious and smartly attentive staff. We had a chance to meet and chat at length with the owner, Ali Chraibi, who generously lavishes his love of art and graceful living on his riad. He is proud of his creation and we were more pleased & happy to reside there than as any other riad, hotel or Airbnb my wife and I have ever stayed at. And the city of Rabat itself was a great discovery, fascinating and beautiful. We can't recommend this riad and this city more!"
 April 2022,5,"Chic, chilled out hotel","Warm, friendly welcome! Great location for the medina and kasbah ! Nice room, great shower with plenty hot water and pressure ! A first in morocco ho ho ho ! Cool modern chic now with a beautifully restored extension. Rooftop terrace with real grass to chill out on after a days sightseeing !"
 April 2022,5,Simply Beautiful!,"It was such a pleasure staying at the lovely artistic Riad Zyo! Loved that there was a blend of the modern and old Moroccan architecture in one riad + beautiful works of art all around! Such a feast for the eyes! Was lucky to also have been the first guest to occupy my room in the new wing. Great breakfast! Strong Wi-fi! Good location right at the edge of the Medina. While the humble and very hospitable owner, Dr. Ali is an active surgeon, he is a patron of the arts and closely involved in the design of the riad as well as personally attends to the guests when he’s there! Highly recommended!"
 March 2022,5,Stay in the heart of the City in Rabat Surrounded by Art,"You are treated like family in this traditional, Moroccan building with unique rooftop garden, nice pool/fountain and interesting artwork everywhere. The hotel is located on a quiet street a few doors down from great shopping streets with good restaurants. Great, helpful staff!"
 October 2021,5,A Treause,The treasure hidden in the Medina is certainly an unexpected treasure. From the outside like any other Riad . It is in reality two Riads. One entrance an artistically designed modern look with traditionally design elements. However thru another entrance on another small street the other half it is a traditional Riad built in 1375. The tile work still amazing after all these years. The staff is friendly.
 October 2021,5,Chic and comfortable,This was our first stop in Morocco and it was an awesome transition. The hotel staff was kind and attentive. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Water pressure was great. The hotel itself is gorgeous and a nice blend of old and new. Rooftop deck was amazing. Breakfast was delicious. Would highly recommend!
 September 2021,5,"Stylish, conveniently located lodging with rooftop dining - - * highly recommend *","Ideal place to start our 15-day Moroccan adventure with a two-day stay. Warm welcome with tea and cookies, plus a later greeting from the owner (a physician). Delicious fresh fish dinner, served in a well-decorated (two oversize portraits of children) room with three tables alongside the courtyard (see photo). Medallion cabernet sauvignon wine from Morocco was the only red selection, fortunately -- delicious, and it became our choice throughout the trip. (Cost here of 250 dirhams was the lowest.) Dinner also is served on the terrace -- as are breakfasts, if wanted. Comfortable, quiet, well-sized room with inner courtyard view and bottled water provided daily. Ideal location near a main shopping and banking boulevard, a tram line and within a 10-minute walk from the Casbah…"
 October 2021,5,Stylish and cozy place to stay. Amazing,This is one of the most beautiful Riads we have been in Morocco. A perfect combination of Morocco heritage and modern design. Must go there. The rooms are cozy and stylish. The breakfast was delicious. I felt there as if I were at home. You really should stay there when in Rabat
 September 2021,5,Delightful,"This was our first stop in Morocco and we were delighted with the friendly welcome. It was wonderful watching the proper way to make mint tea, served with delicious homemade pastries. The courtyard with pool was just as lovely as the photos and we opted for their dinner: chicken tagine. It was fab. Would definitely recommend."
 May 2021,5,Hospitality and Beauty,"We are delighted. The hotel is clean, tidy, beautiful and full of hospitality. Beautiful paintings are eye catching. Food are delicious and mouth watering. And the hotel owner sit with us chatting along dinner sharing stories about Moroccan life style. 👍🏻 Do not forget to enjoy the rooftop..."
 May 2021,5,First night in Morocco.,"Upon arrival in Rabat we were greeted by the owner of the property. He carried our luggage to the room, which was modern and very clean. That evening his chef prepared a dinner for two of local Moroccan food. Because of COVID regulations being lifted we were the only guests in a 12 room hotel. Extremely friendly staff and we highly recommend this property. Bill and Angie Lardent Smyrna, TN We used Audrey Travel who contracted with TraveLink who provided us with a professional driver for our ten day trip."
 February 2021,5,By far the best place to stay in Rabat,"Riad Zyo was recommended to us and it has by far exceeded all our expectations. The owners, Ali, his son Younès and the entire staff were more than just super helpful and friendly : they made us feel like Riad Zyo was our home for a week. Breakfast was delicious and tailored according to our taste. Whatever we needed - taxis, laundry, recommendations etc - there was always someone to immediately find a solution. The riad in itself is a beautiful mix of contemporary architecture, cultural heritage and art gallery. The rooms were comfortable and clean, we slept very well. It is also conveniently located, close to pretty much everything there is to see in Rabat. We can only hope to have other occasions to come back. Once again, a million thanks for this wonderful experience…"
 February 2021,5,Tea and Dinner,"This place is a hidden gem. We visited jist to have a private dinner but should have also stayed at least one night in one of their beautiful rooms. We were greeted by the chef when he arrived. Took us on a wonderful tour of the Riad and prepped some tea for us on the roof top terrace. In the middle of the hustle and bustle of the medina, the noise softens as you enjoy the view of your surroundings. You feel you are in the old part or Rabat but you are comfortably sitting at a well appointed and beautifully landscape terrace. The owner was wonderful as well. He took us on a short tour of their expansion into the next Riad. One side is modern while the new side is traditional. You can see how much care they've taken in renovating both sides. The dinner was amazing. It was…"
 September 2020,5,A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!,"Riad Zyo clearly exceeded our expectations. Hidden between the little streets of the old Medina, the moment you step in, you feel that you're already in a different world. The lighting, the colors, the interior design, the cleanliness, the staff... everything is very well thought. Every little corner of this Riad has history and the attention to the details is mind-blowing! I definitely recommend it!"
 March 2020,5,Beautiful Riad with Artistic Design,"The riad has the feel of an art gallery. It is tastefully designed and the room is very spacious and spotlessly clean. It has a great location as the supermarket is just nearby. The host, maybe an artist himself, skilfully made some mint tea for us when we arrived and explained how the steps were needed to refine the tea. It’s great. Thank you very much. We enjoyed our stay in this riad very much and will definitely come back again."
 February 2020,5,Beautiful little Riad,The Riad is a stilish little place in the Medina of Rabat. Very friendly staff and owners. Delicous breakfast. They gave me homemade cinnamon icecream with fresh orange slices when came back after a loung city walk. Beautiful pictures on the walls like a art gallery. Thanks for the nice stay
 October 2019,5,Artsy elegance in the Rabat medina,"I only had one night in Rabat during my tour of Morocco. I would have gladly stayed longer. Riad Zyo was a dazzling riad in a convenient location. It was pleasing to the eye with its many artworks, rooftop garden, and brilliant turquoise central pool. My room was comfortable, and they offered a delicious tagine for dinner and a full breakfast in the morning. Ahmed and Mohammed were most helpful and welcoming. Riad Zyo was perhaps my favorite riad during my two week travels through Morocco."
 January 2020,5,Excelent service at Zyo Ryad,"We were assisted at Zyo Ryad Design by Hisham, who is the most perfect guest host we could expect! Thank you so much Hysham, for your kind assistance, the Ryad is beautiful and comfortable! We will recommend to all our friends!"
 December 2019,3,could be better,"we stayed in Riad Zyo one night at December 2019 (we got 3 rooms for that night). 2 of the rooms had no hot water at the evening and one of them did not have hot water on the next morning as well. the carpets were dirty in all the rooms, and one of the rooms the air condition was on 30 degree but it was no good. luckily they have another option for heating so after a few hours the room was warm. the Riad is very lovely and all were very polite and friendly. the breakfast was wonderful and very generous and the breakfast room was lovely and heated. (Morocco in December is very cold at night and it was very important to have hot water and heating). we all thought it can be much better with some more care and maintenance."
 December 2019,5,Honeymoon trip,"We did a five day tour honeymoon tour at stayed at Riad Zyo for one night. The room was beautiful and authentic, very comfortable and modern infused with the beautiful Moroccan culture. Our reception was so warm and friendly. This hotel felt like home away from home because of how lovely the hotel staff are. Mr Ali was so kind and hospitable during our breakfast and the breakfast was just lovely. We came back again and stayed another day at the end of our trip because we enjoyed it so much and again, we were not disappointed. Thank you Mr Ali for the little honeymoon souvenirs. I would highly recommend this hotel. Clean, comfortable, spacious and beautiful. The small pool at the reception was my favourite! Strongly recommend to anyone looking for a warm and intimate stay!"
 December 2019,5,Best Riad in our Morocco Trip,"By far, this was the best riad we stayed in our 16-day tour in Morocco. Friendly and realiable service, perfect location near the medina/souks, stylish and modern rooms and a wonderful breakfast. Well done, guys!"
 December 2019,5,"Small room, but excellent experience","My wife and I stayed here on our first night of a whirlwind tour of Morocco. (I’ve posted a separate review of our excellent tour company, Good Travelling in Morocco.) Beautiful, charming place, with a welcoming friendly staff. Room we stayed in was quite small, but otherwise comfortable. Wonderful bed; quiet; good climate control; bathroom small with limited space to place stuff, but shower was reasonable size. Breakfast was excellent, with a mix of traditional and modern. Like many other charming riads, getting to the room requires going up steep, winding, uneven stairs, so not a good place for anyone who’s mobility challenged, but not a problem for us. Rabat was not the highlight of our trip to Morocco, but it was worth visiting for sites such as the “Incomplete Mosque”,…"
 December 2019,5,"Beautiful accommodations, excellent dining",This beautiful Riad was elegantly appointed. The chef made special accommodations for a gluten free diet and the food was wonderful. We had to depart very early the next morning and the staff again made special accommodations to be sure coffee and cakes were waiting for us. Excellent experience in every way!
 November 2019,5,Charming Riad,"Riad Zyo is ideally situated inside the medina. We stayed here on our first night in Morroco and it did not disappoint. Our room was spacious and included basic amenities we would possibly need. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. Overall, Riad Zyo provided a very comfortable stay. Highly recommended!"
 October 2019,5,Perfect Riad Stay,"I reserved three rooms in Riad Zyo for myself and the friends I was traveling with, and we were all so happy with everything about our stay. The location is convenient to explore the very colorful and traditional Medina. Upon entering Riad Zyo after our flight from NYC and a short tour around Casablanca, we were overwhelmed how beautifully yet simply the Riad was decorated, especially with the amazing photographs and colorful paintings. We were warmly greeted by a staff member, invited into the salon, and offered mint tea and home-made cookies. Every member of the staff was so hospitable and pleasant. The home-made breakfast by Adda was served in a lovely room, with beautiful coordinated plates and bowls. Omelettes were offered in addition to the baked goods and jams. The rooms…"
 November 2019,2,"Avarage Hotel, Nothing Luxurious.","Me and my friend were offered a bigger room at the second floor but wasn't anything surprising. There was a glass door in the bathroom which you can see through and wasn't comfortable having that type of door in the hotel room. Also the bath was very dirty, like someone threw bunch of sand or dirt. Noticed the bed sheet underneath was covered brown or red stains, don't know if that was blood by any chance but had to get rid of it because no way I was sleeping on it. The breakfast I and my friend had was very good, however, we didn't choose anything. Staff members were bringing breakfast for us without telling us what we wanted. Overall, the hotel needs improvement with hygiene."
 October 2019,5,"The warm hospitality, the location and the breakfast were great!","This was a lovely stay. The location is perfect in the Medina, walking distance to major sites like Udayas or an easy taxi ride away from Chellah ruins. The breakfast at the Zyo was really great, they offered omelet with cheese and the best Msemen (flakey filo dough type pancakes) that we had our whole trip, and fresh squeezed orange juice with coffee of course! The host who welcomed us Ishmaan (apologies for spelling), was so warm and took time to orient us on the location and the sites. Later the following day after I took a small fall on the uneven streets in the Medina he came to the rescue with bandaid and first aid for my elbow. We loved our time at the Zyo and recommend it wholeheartedly."
 October 2019,5,Lovely riad and super nice staff,We stayed here on the first night in Morocco. It's a beautiful and clean riad with a great location. The reception staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was well prepared and tasty. I highly recommend it.
 September 2019,5,definitely recommend,"We, two couples, stayed only one night at beginning of our trip. Welcoming hosts, dinner nice, able to order a bottle of wine, accommodation ie rooms very nice. We were impressed and would recommend. It was a bit of an oasis after bustle of flights, airports, drive, etc. So we were pleased to be welcomed."
 October 2019,4,"Nice place, food okay",We stayed there one night on our way to Chefchaouen. Lovely little riad. Room was small but very nice. Lots of outlets for charging. We had dinner there and it was tasty but small portions and expensive. Dinner cost over 50 USD. If you want to save some money there a many street restaurants to choose from. Would definitely recommend this place.
 October 2019,5,Penny,We stayed at this Riad two nights ago! They were very gracious and did everything they could to Make sure we were happy! They had a wonderful breakfast The decor was very aesthetically pleasing. On the top floor there was a wonderful little retreat where you could see the scenery for miles
 September 2019,5,Fantastic Riad,It was our first night in Morrocco. The host was extremely welcoming. Offered coffee and the most amazing mint tea with biscuits before going to our room. The bed was extremely comfortable. Had an amazing breakfast. The Riad is a beautiful place to stay and would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Rabat. Very quiet and centrally located.
 September 2019,5,Modern and beautiful riad,"Located in the medina, a few steps from the main street. Zyo is a modern and luxury riad. Even it is near the medina, it is so tranquil. We spent only one night there. The riad provides you everything you need: super comfortable big bed and pillows, clean room, big towels, hair dryer, a/c, safe etc. It also has a stunning rooftop terrace and swimming pool at the center."
 September 2019,5,Amazing,"Very nice Riad, great location in the Medina, amazing room with a great shower. Friendly staff! Increadible dinner I had in the terrace, with great food and thanks to all staff! The mint tea they serve is awesome!"
 September 2019,5,Amazing!,"From the moment we stepped inside this beautiful place, we received a great service for our stay. The rooms are beautiful and the food is amazing. Look no further this is the best place to stay in Rabat."
 September 2019,5,Overnight in Rabat,Riad Zyo is clean and beautiful. Staff is friendly and the wifi is fast 😁 loved our room and coming home to comfort after two days of flying to Morocco. Expect to be greeted with a steaming cup of Mint tea and a smile
 August 2019,5,Fabulous !,We were made to feel welcome the minute we arrived by Ishaam. He served us lively mint tea and Moroccan pastry. The Riad is beautifully designed with a pool in the middle a lovely lounging area and breakfast room. The bedrooms are stunning with lovely bathrooms . And the best is the rooftop to sit and relax . The Riad is located in the Médina and you can walk to the markets for food and shopping . Also lovely sites to explore in walking distance. Breakfast was unusually different and very tasty. Will definitely recommend it.
 August 2019,4,Comfortable Accomodation,"Super friendly staff who goes out all way to help guest with their checking in and answer all enquirys , centrally located in the Médina that sells cheap food , Basic amenities provided , shampoos/Bath Wash/ Hair dryers etc.If eating in crowded street if Médina is not your scene , the in house comfortable dining area serves local cuisine , however I had not eaten in this place other then the morning inclusive breakfast ."
 July 2019,5,Beautful Raid with a lovely team.,"We spent time at Riad Zyo at the end of our round trip from Marrakech to the desert and back to Fes and Rabat. We enjoyed Rabat and Riad Zyo enormnously. The city Rabat is a mixture of modern and tradition Marocco, as is Riad Zyo. The Riad is a traditional patio house which has been modernised in a very tastful way. What you get is a comtemporary atmosphere in the heart of the old city ('medina'). Even in the rooms traditional handmade elements like floor tiles remind you of the rich and old culture of Marocco. But the real treasure of Riad Zyo are the people. We haven't felt so welcome in a long time. All warm, helping and interested people,: the hotel owner, the manager, the cook, the cleaners… Highly recommended!"
 June 2019,5,Lovely place and great service,"We stayed there for one night while visiting Rabat. The place is lovely and relaxing. I explained my gluten dietary restrictions to Hicham, the manager, and he arranged for a lovely breakfast packed with eggs and fruit. Definitely could have stayed longer."
 June 2019,5,Lovely mesh of old and new,"A lovely little riad in the heart of the old market. Clean and beautiful, with eclectic modern paintings which somehow work perfectly with the traditional Moroccan style. Everything was wonderful - service, rooms, beds, bathrooms. Gorgeous little pool in the center of the structure,surrounded by a sitting area and a small dining room. Super friendly service."
 June 2019,5,Wonderful,"We had a one night stay at this gorgeous Riad. The staff were so friendly - it really made the stay! Our rooms were beautiful, a modern take on traditional Moroccan style. We liked the art that was everywhere. Breakfast was good and we loved the pool and roof terrace. Location was great too - perfect for exploring the Medina."
 April 2019,5,Great Riad in the Medina,"We had a wonderful stay at Zyo Riad. Rooms were bright, clean, and comfortable. Food was excellent, Internet fine. Well run! Be sure to check out the pool and roof top garden. We will definitely be back!"
 April 2019,5,Artistic riad in the medina,"Wonderful riad in the Medina of Rabat. The place is beautiful, with a nice artistic touch that really catches the eye. The staff is super friendly (special mention to Hicham!) and helpful and the food is very good, also! We had a truly amazing stay, and if we ever come back to Rabat we'll definitely choose Riad Zyo again."
 March 2019,4,Excellent,"We enjoyed our one night stay here very much. The room was spacious, bright and clean. We dined in the restaurant and enjoyed our meal. The hosts were charming and made us feel welcome on our first night in Morocco."
 March 2019,5,"Élégant, well located","We stayed only one night, due to travel schedule. Each room is unique, many great design touches. Young staff, friendly and eager to help. Served a properly prepared mint tea. Delicious group dinner and breakfast. Sweet roof top thoughtfully designed and well maintained. You may arrive bedraggled but you will leave refreshed. Oh, mature couple, frequent travelers."
 March 2019,5,Exceptional 10/10,Travelled as 65 year old couple. Accommodation booked by tour company. Walk to the Riad is down an alley from the main road..We became a bit more anxious as we were walking towards the Riad with our luggage. Once the door opened you are in an oasis of tranquility. The difference from the outside to the inside is quite remarkable. We were met by Mohammed the manager. Very welcoming and offered us tea and cookies and showed us to our room. The entire place was spotless. Nice size bedroom and nice bathroom with shower. We were in the room (called-Favourite). It’s up one flight of stairs and the window faces the alley/lane but this was not an issue at all with regards to any noise. The bed was very comfortable-large king size bed and lots of cupboard space. We were only staying…
 March 2019,5,A lovely place to stay in the Medina,We stayed here the first night in Morocco. It was lovely and the staff were friendly. We had a nice room overlooking the street which was quiet by 8pm. We were greated with the traditional mint tea and cookies. The breakfast was delicious with eggs to order. The location in the Medina was perfect.
 February 2019,5,A modern riad,"We been only a night to this beautiful modern riad in the middle of the Médina near a road full of shops.. the room it was really nice and clean, the staff is professional and they welcome you with a cup of mint tea at your arrived.. the breakfast is really good"
 January 2019,5,Beautiful Riad Combining the Old with the New,"Our first night in Morocco was spent at Riad Zyo and what a delightful experience it was. When we entered the riad we were greeted by a charming member of the staff who offered us freshly brewed mint tea and then showed us to our room. The rooms are built around a lovely blue pool which is the focus of the riad. Our room was very clean, very comfortable and quite modern with WiFi included. We chose to have dinner at the Riad and are so pleased that we did. The food was delicious and beautifully prepared. I do not hesitate to recommend Riad Zyo to Trip Advisor travelers."
 September 2018,4,Lovely Ryad,"The ryad - essentially a guess house - was cozy, simple, clean and well maintained with friendly staff. We arrived early one morning and the staff met us by the car to carry our luggage to the hotel which is a short 2 minute walk. Upon entry, they led us to the common sitting area, across from the lobby to complete the paperwork where they also poured the traditional Moroccan tea and snacks to welcome us - which was beautifully presented. The Ryad seemed to have been recently completed renovation - there was no dust or work happening while we were there but there were a few minor things in the one of the rooms that they had previously told us they were working to fix but overall it did not affect our stay as our rooms were spacious and comfortable. The rooftop patio is a…"
 February 2019,4,Modern Riad,"Stayed at Zyo one night, appears to be recently refurbished. Rooms were fresh, light and bright, finished to high standards. Modern fitouts - radiators, hair dryers, bright lights, etc. Nice roof terrace with small garden to sit in the evening, no views though. There was a water feature in the courtyard, wasn’t sure if it’s meant to be a small pool! Nice lounge area and dining area. Good location for the medina, short walk to shops, restaurants and the beach. Breakfast was included, was good, a number of different cakes and pastries on offer. Hot water shower was temperamental and WiFi signal was weak, but otherwise, was a good stay."
 December 2018,4,Lovely boutique hotel with a modern take on the traditional Moroccan ambiance.,"In the Medina, yet reasonably accessible except for a short walk. Very hospital staff, excellent service. Rooms are modern and well appointed. Breakfast and dinner were excellent. Decor is a contemporary take on Moroccan decor, and unlike the traditional riads we stayed in elsewhere. Highly recommended."
 December 2018,5,"Welcoming, beautiful and well located Riad in the Rabat Medina","The riad looks even better in person. The courtyard is stunning and the rooms are well appointed. Hisham, who works at the Riad, was a wonderful host who went out of his way to make us feel comfortable. Riad Zyo stood out as one of the best riads that we stayed in during our trip to Morocco. Thanks to Hisham, Mohamed and the staff at Riad Zyo for making our stay memorable."
 December 2018,5,VERY GOOD,"Perfect Riad (hotel) , good location, good room and very good bed . Typical and traditional decoration ,very nice! the breakfast is very good with traditional food ! If you visit Rabat , it is a very good place to stay."
 December 2018,5,"Beautiful, contemporary, excellent service",A real treat to stay here - beautiful artwork and tile-work throughout this classy riad. Breakfast also fantastic. Felt immediately at home. Short walk to great street food in the centre of Rabat. Make sure to check out the rooftop terrace with a great view of Rabat.
 December 2018,5,Nice place and friendly staff!,"We stayed there just last night for one night before traveling to another city and this Ryad was the perfect place for us. The room was inviting and the place even had a lovely rooftop terrace where we played cards while enjoying a pleasant evening. Hisham, was the one who waited on us. He was kind, friendly and very helpful. I highly recommend it."
 December 2018,5,Boutique Riad,"A modern expression of traditional Moroccan riad in a very strategic location of Rabat. Just out of the riad, you have many restaurants and small shops for you to patronise. The riad is dazzling with Moroccan-styled design but with modern colours. If not for the cold weather, I will really love to have a dip in the pool because it was so beautiful. The staffs were extremely nice and breakfast was superb! If you are going to stay in the hotel, it is a must to get the breakfast! The room was very clean. All the basic amenities were provided for! We love the riad very much! Love, Joreen and Anjana"
 October 2018,5,Great Small Riad in Rabat,"Zyo is a small riad (5 or 6 Rooms). in Rabat. Our flight into Casablanca was delayed and by the time our driver had gotten us to the Riad it was close to 11:00 pm. The staff of Zyo had been kind enough to keep the kitchen open to serve us dinner which we very much appreciated since there didn’t appear to be any other options for food in the area. The dining area is pleasant with interesting art and is adjacent to a small central pool that is open to the sky. The room was of modest size and comfortable. Getting to the Riad is a bit of an issue. When we arrived late in the evening, and we we left at around 9:00 am the following morning, the street to the Riad was closed. So we had to haul our luggage a few 100 yards to get to the Riad. This was an unpleasant experience…"
 October 2018,5,Best Riad in Morocco,"You will not be disappointed in this hotel. It's newly renovated, clean and brighter than any other riad we stayed in during our two week trip. The meals were superb; even the mushroom omelette served at breakfast was delicious. The service was impeccable, too."
 October 2018,4,Very nice modern Riad,"Our experience was a good one. The food was very good, the location is central in the Medina, and the service was excellent. The only issue was our room was on the first floor off the central area and there were people speaking loudly in this area in the evening. This issue was the people, not the hotel itself."
 August 2018,5,Favorite and most beautiful riad visiting Morocco,"We did a tour of the imperial cities passing thru Rabat. This was by far my favorite riad. After passing the reception area, there is a pool in the courtyard to relax in after walking around the city. The blue of the pool is so beautiful with the white of the building and the art from local artists. I also got lucky to have the room with the terrace garden outside. Besides being beautiful, the staff was wonderful, and the food was outstanding. The chef not only made the best food we ate on our trip, but also again beautifully presented. This was by far my favorite riad on all levels."
 October 2018,5,A spotless well run beautiful riad,"We were given a warm welcome on check in and after tea and a chat about where to go in the Médina were shown to our room. As with most roads, the room was small but there is a beautiful roof terrace and a very inviting small pool on the ground floor. The Riad is very centrally located being in the heart of the old Médina. We loved our stay and would definitely recommend."
 October 2018,5,An oasis in the capital,"Juxtapositions of modernity within the traditional medina. An oasisi for the weary traveller with its own garden on the rooftop. Great hospitality, delicious food, wonderful deco, what more could one wish. Highly recommended."
 October 2018,5,Without doubt one of the best,"Its hard to know whether its the fantastic friendly service, lovely food, or the stunning room/outdoor areas that make this riad so memorable. A stay here will never disappoint. Its location in the medina but close to Avenue Laalou makes it very handy/easy to get to using a taxi. Mohammed has such an attention to detail, be it at your arrival with refreshments, during breakfast or dinner, or when helping plan your local tour guides."
 September 2018,5,Sepp kleinen,Very nice area inside the city of rabat clean room a varied breakfast tanks to my brother ahmed for his services and welcoming us and giving us all of his time in dinner and i hope to visite you again
 October 2018,5,Modern riad,We stayed at 7 places in Morocco and this was the nicest spot. Lovely room and central courtyard and rooftop. The breakfast was delicious! The Riad is right in the Médina so very handy location for exploring the old town.
 September 2018,5,First time vacation in Morocco,Fabulous location close to the important sights. Authentic Moroccan charm with a wonderfully contemporary flair making it a joy to stay at. Restaurant is superb. Staff is charming and accommodating. The owner shows his love of what he has created in the Ryad Zyo. Perfect base from which to explore the wonders of Rabat
 September 2018,5,"Good location, great service",This was our first two nights in Morocco. We were pleasantly surprised with quality and decor. Both of the two breakfasts and dinners were a great way to get introduced to local cuisine. They have a roof side pool which looked inviting though we didn't use. We found our stay to be welcoming and comfortable.
 July 2018,4,Great location,"A very modern riad for our one night stay in Rabat. There is a pool for you to relax in as well as common reading and eating area. It's a short walk to lots of small shops and places to get a quick snack. Perhaps a 10 minute walk back to the Andulsian Gardens. The room itself was clean and modern with a small desk. Even though we had a room on the ground floor next to the pool, it was still pretty quiet. Breakfast the next morning was very filling."
 March 2018,5,Best breakfasts and most genuine hospitality we experienced on our trip,"We stayed here for three nights in March and found the Riad Zyo staff incredibly welcoming. They truly embody the warm hospitality one reads about while planning a trip to Morocco. We had dinner at the Riad one night and it was some of the best food we ate on our two-week trip. The breakfasts were varied and far far better than the other two riads we stayed in elsewhere. The mattresses are firm, which is great for some, but not so for me. When I made a little whine about that at breakfast one day, we returned to the room to find a different mattress being installed. When I admired a little porcelain tagine being used at dinner, our last night, I asked the owner where I could find them and he had one wrapped up to send home with me. This kind of responsiveness was so touching,…"
 August 2018,5,Amazing! Highly recommended.,Zyo riad is stunningly beautiful! The staff are lovely and very helpful. The garden Oasis in the roof is very tranquil and a wonderful space to unwind! We had dinner and breakfast both of which were lovely. Don’t miss a chance to stay here.
 June 2018,4,Riad Zyo Pristine,"A beautiful modern Riad, we had a very nice welcome with mint tea. A short walk to the Medina. I enjoyed a swim in the beautiful refreshing pool. Breakfast was special and the bright breakfast room looked out over the pool. A great way to start the day. Staff all very friendly.Very impressed and would stay again."
 July 2018,5,Sure to win your heart over,Quaint place to truly give you a taste of Moroccan hospitality. The receptionist/manager Waled was well-informed about guests' needs. The food they served was simply exquisite and of good portions. It was fresh and tasty and of Moroccan authenticity. They have a rooftop as well where you can lay down at and look at the overview of the neighbourhood. Walk outside and you will be greeted with locals going on about their day and restaurants. The place was rather artistic with a little pool and very well-maintained. We were truly satisifed and it is value for money.
 July 2018,5,Wonderfull place,"This place is really worthwhile staying at. We were welcomed personally by the owner and offered water, tea and coffee with home cookies (free of charge). The place is a riad but in a modern light style. It has a lovely rooftop terrace and lovely little swimming pool to cool down. We had a very nice lunch there, but the real treat is the breakfast: they serve you all kinds of lovely home made treats in stead of the usual buffet. We felt spoiled! The room was great. Very pretty and spotless clean. We highly recommend this place."
 July 2018,5,Bella Zyo,"Amazing Riad un the heart of Rabat medina.once that you open the main door you're immediatlely it by the beauty of this place,a mixture of modern and old history.Recently renewed,very clean and comfortble. A nice swimming pool,a beautiful garden on the rooftop where you can have a rest and get your green the.staff very knd,Akran speaks good english and he was very helpfull and kind.great breakfast.this the place to be in Rabat!"
 July 2018,5,Terrific!!!,"My friend and I spent only one night in this fantastic riad but there’s nothing else to say that it was terrific! Akran is very kind, nice and helpful. The riad is at the beginning of medina and near to the main street."
 June 2018,5,The perfect stay,"Everything about our stay was perfect. The location in the medina was ideal for exploring Rabat on foot. The room was clean and modern, yet it still felt like we were in a Moroccan riad. The breakfast was different both mornings, offering a tasty variety of freshly baked items. From the start of our stay, the polite and helpful service we received from Mohammed really helped us to make the most of our stay in Rabat. He helped us to plan a route that enabled us to see all of the most interesting locations. The roof terrace was an ideal spot to enjoy mint tea. Definitely give this place a try."
 May 2018,5,Lovely riad,Just stayed one night. In the medina but very easy to walk from the main street where you are dropped off. Excellent location to explore the Kasbah & medina. Very good breakfast. And exceptional front office - very friendly & helpful. Go for it!
 May 2018,5,Lovely modern riad,"I only had a short one night stay at the end of my trip, but I very much enjoyed this stylish little riad which had a unique, modern, artsy feel. I opted to have dinner here and the meal was delicious, as was the included breakfast in which the staff kept bringing out more and more plates of food. The location seemed convenient, though I didn't have much chance to explore."
 April 2018,4,Charming Riad in good location,"We stayed here, on our first night of our trip to Morocco and it was a comfortable place to stay. This is a modern take on a traditional Riad, and the owner displays works of art of contemporary Moroccan artists in the public spaces. We had a warm welcome upon arrival, excellent and helpful staff, excellent breakfast. My only disappointment was the room was that the room we were in was really small even though there were more spacious rooms available."
 April 2018,5,Luxury in the middle of the Medina,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights. It was the perfect location in the Medina and to walk to the Kasbah. Breakfasts were wonderful with fresh squeezed orange juice, hot coffee, and home baked goods and eggs! We highly recommend a stay here!"
 April 2018,5,Lovely Riad and Service,"We stayed here on our first night in Morocco. This Riad had charming rooms, great service and food. We were well taken care of and had a quiet night, unlike other places we stayed in Morocco! I would stay here again."
 April 2018,5,Fantastic,"Owner Ali gave us a very warm welcome. We drank freshly brewed minttea. He has nice personnel, a very good cook, a beautiful modernly restored riad where you see the good taste. Ali is a perfect host. Everything he looks after and is perfectly organised. He even bought us an nice bottle of rosé wine. The garden on the roof is small but lovely kept. Perfect for enjoying the eveningsun. The room we had looked at the small pool. The bathroom was handcrafted ‘tadelakt’ with mosaics. The bed was heavenly with luxurous sheets. The livingroom was nicely furnished. The breakfast was very nice and freshly homemade. We really want to stay longer and will recommend this riad to everyone else. Thank you very much Ali!!"
 April 2018,4,Small boutique hotel,Very cool and modern. Nice design and clean but the room we had was quite small... however staff here are extremely friendly and they got up so early to prepare breakfast for us as we neede to leave at 6.15am!! Thank you very everything~ it was a great end to our trip👍🏻
 February 2018,5,Delightful Gem!,"The riad is located near the Atlantic entrance of the medina, off of an alley - you wouldn't expect to find this mini-oasis from the appearance of the surroundings! Greeted by our host with the requisite (and very nice) mint green-tea, the riad is very comfortable, very well furnished and relaxing. Dinner was excellent - and they offer wine for those guests who partake. The view of the evening and night-time sky from the roof terrace was engaging as well. We are a couple on a semi-extended trip of Morocco and felt this riad was one of the best."
 March 2018,5,A memorable experience,"This Riad is only 5 years old. It has been totally re-built in an old post office by the owner, a medical doctor who has given it an extraordinary footprint, with modern furniture, beautiful paintings (a vernissage had been held a few days before) of an unknown painter (a prison guard) by the owner and an excellent traditional cuisine re-visited by the chef. Every single object in the hotel reflected elegance and style, attention to details and charme. Our dinner was served by the owner himself who was on duty that evening - everything was just perfect, including an excellent white wine recommended by him. A memorable experience."
 February 2018,5,Small riad but pleasant stay,"After few minutes walk from the car park, we arrived to this riad, greeted by the person in charge. Looks like it was recently upgraded and nicely renovated. There's a small pool on the ground floor and my room is on the first floor. We were delighted that the room is considered big for two, very clean. Adjacent to my room is a small garden."
 March 2018,5,True treasure and warm hospitality,We had the most amazing hosts and reception by the staff and owner. Lovely gorgeous spacious rooms and classy riad feeling. A must stay place in rabat. Don't miss the opportunity of the experience of a lifetime
 November 2017,3,"Friendly staff; clean, but ordinary room","Staff was very friendly and helped us to find restaurants in the area. Our room, however, was small and plain. Typical for riad, there are no windows in the room. There is a sliding glass door opening to a courtyard, but opening the drapes would have meant we had no privacy whatsoever."
 January 2018,5,Modern Riad and excellent breakfast petite quiche,"Stayed here one night in Jan 2018. Modern and bright; comfortable mattress; clean, great location. Breakfast was good, fresh, petite quiche amazing, order of scramble eggs offered too! Would definitely stay here again."
 December 2017,5,What an oasis!,We arrived at Riad Zyo on our first night in Morocco- what a delight. The owner and staff are so warm and friendly. We had a quiet dinner to ourselves- the owner joined us and gave us an intro to Morocco completely unsolicited! A lovely place to start a magical journey through the country.
 December 2017,5,The Best Riad for our 2 week stay in Morocco,"We stayed at Riad Zyo on our first night in Morocco. We didn't know what to expect & it was a really nice surprise ! 3 of us stayed in 2 rooms & both rooms were modern & bright ! Service was immaculate. Breakfast was really high quality as well. We got to appreciate Riad Zyo even more after our 2 weeks holiday in Morocco. Most of the riads we stayed at were dark, small & old. Although they were all full of characters, we all prefer Riad Zyo which is a really special Riad. Highly recommended !"
 October 2017,5,Perfect Start To Our Tour,"We stayed at Riad Zyo on the first night of our Moroccan adventure and it was the perfect start. We were greater with tea and cookies on our arrival. The location was great for walking to restaurants and the Kasbah Oudaya, though the main street (Avenue Mohammad?) was under construction. Our room was spacious,clean and comfortable, with a pleasing modern design. Highly recommended."
 August 2017,5,Perfect one night stay for a family of four,"This is a really cute riad. Although on the smaller end of some of the riads where we've stayed, the rooms were not too small. I love the modern decor of the riad, it was nice, bright, and airy. The rooms were clean (we had Pacha and Kaid). The bathrooms were mold-free. The food was good, but not the best we've had while visiting Morocco. We would definitely stay here again."
 December 2017,5,The best Riad in town,"The owner and the personnel had the best service we have ever had, delicious food, beautiful decoration, and we enjoyed having two birthdays with them. When we return to Rabat, this is the place we are staying in."
 December 2017,5,Our home in Rabat,This is really like our home in Rabat after having stayed here now a couple of times. The owner Ali is a great host and also his manager Mehdi is very welcoming and attentive. Just a lovely and comfortable place to stay with great food and very nice situated in the medina within walking distance from Oudaya and also the city center. We can certainly strongly recommend to stay here and also to ask them to arrange for a city guide to show you the medina of Sale. We will certainly come back again!
 December 2017,4,Quaint and Cozy and Unique,"We stayed one night in this Riad and cannot lie that we were a bit apprehensive as our driver was pulling our suitcase through some dusty, dirty, crumbling and puddle filled streets. Upon entering, we found a small square charming pool and a very unique lobby. We were greeted with hot tea and Moroccan cookies. All the rooms are on the second floor so be warned that there is no lift. The room and bath were small but nicely decorated. There were 2 ""wall plate"" heaters but they did not generate enough heat. The room had a safe, hair dryer and disposable slippers. We had diner at the hotel and found it to be quite pricey. We ordered 2 tagines and they came with nothing but the meat - an accompanying side dish would have been nice such as rice, potatoes or vegetables. The chicken and…"
 December 2017,5,An oasis in Rabat,"I stayed at this delightful Riad as part of a tour and was not disappointed by this choice! A sleek, stylish and still comfy take on the Moroccan style with lots of creature comforts and some of the best service I’ve experienced!"
 November 2017,5,Modern yet very Moroccan,"We only spent a night here but were very impressed with this modern interpretation of the riad. Beautiful, tranquil interiors in the lobby as well as the room. The bathroom was also beautifully designed with a wonderful shower that could be used as a bath. We were also impressed with the dinner, which was served to us personally by the owner of the riad, Ali. We had to leave early for Casablanca so were a little disappointed to miss breakfast. The riad is also a short walk from the souk and the Kasbah of the Udayas."
 November 2017,5,Perfection!,"This is the sort of riad experience that travellers dream of. It is modern, stylish and beautifully presented in all respects. The service is faultless, the rooms are comfortable and the food is a particular delight. This riad is conveniently situated just inside the Medina which makes access and luggage handling very easy. Plans for expansion mean that there will be more rooms on offer in the near future and it is the sort of place that begs for a return visit!"
 November 2017,4,Clean central,"Mohammad gave us a great welcome, welcoming us with lovely mint tea. Very central, in the middle of quite clean medina...no fishheads to talk through! Easy walking distance to everywhere in the city. Lovely breakfast, and they very kindly gave us an early breakfast on the day we were leaving . The pool is NOT a swimming pool...more a plunge pool."
 December 2016,5,Excellent 1 night stay,Nice Riad in Rabat - a little hard to find once you are out exploring the market place and the medina. Rabat medina is overwhelming for an outsider. It was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Terrace is a garden-like view with trees (real trees) and there is a small pool in the centre of the courtyard.
 September 2017,5,"Modern, comfortable, and functional","Riad Zyo is the modern interpretation of a traditional riad, and it works. My wife and I spent one night in this property and we felt right. Our room was spacious, clean, and functional; it's on the first floor. The decoration of the place was minimalistic and in white; giving it a sense of space and new dimension. There is a study and common area on the ground floor beside the pool; and rooftop area to watch sunset. Staff were friendly and responsive; often came with a smile. We had dinner and breakfast at the riad and they were delicious and portions were generous. We enjoyed it. The property is off the busy main street and is within walking distance to Kasbah des Oudaias. It is a little gem."
 October 2017,5,Great dinner!,"This was our first experience with pastillas, a kind of Moroccan pie made with phyllo pastry. We had both the vegetable with cheese and the chicken with almonds and they were both heavenly! We were served personally by the owner who had a complete meal prepared for the two of us with specific ingredients that we ordered."
 September 2017,5,Modern and delightful inside a quaint traditional riad,"Beautiful compact room. Everything was clean and modern inside the room but set in a traditional road structure, Rooftop terrace for anyone who wishes to relax. English and French speaking service with wonderful treatment, this place is worth every dime and well located,"
 August 2017,5,"Lovely, very authentic place to stay at",We were in Morocco on a two weeks tour that our tour guide we hired private Morocco Nomadic Travel had reserved a two stay for us ( family of three ) at Riad Zyo in Rabat. the place so neat and clean. The architecture of the place reflected the old Morocco architecture and history. It is in Old City called Al-Madina AL-Ateeqa. The service was excellent. From outside we were little bit puzzled when we arrived and once we entered the riyad we saw a different amazing place. We loved it and recommend it for anyone who is interested in old city of Rabat. It is in the middle of city old bazaar where you can see local people visitors to the city.
 August 2017,5,What a nice place,This place is amazing and beautiful. Quite and clean with excellent services. The food was really good and tasty. We were surprised when the tour guide took us to this place the outside of the Riad is completely different than the inside. i will go to this Riad again.
 August 2017,5,Beautiful Riad with Excellent food,"My Tip: Have dinner at this Riad! This riad is an oasis in the busy and buzzing medina of Rabat. It's beautifully appointed with a plunge pool in the middle surrounded by rooms on the ground and first floor. The roof top is also nicely appointed with tables, chairs and sun lounges. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The room was small but very clean and had everything you need. The highlight here is the restaurant. It's lovely set out next to the pool with unusual but nice artwork decorating the walls. We had a set menu dinner here that was fantastic. It was a traditional Moroccan menu however the taste and quality of ingredients was amazing. Especially the desert which was a modern take on apple crumble with cinnamon ice cream - a taste sensation with…"
 April 2017,5,Hreat,"This was our 2nd to last riad prior to leaving Morocco and stayed 2 days. A lovely riad with a big dipping pool, sadly still a bit cold but refreshing for sore feet. Lovely room, we had a garden room and unfortunately left the door open for a huge outside cockroach to land on our faces in the middle of the night. It happens! Great terrace and pretty. Relaxing small lounge. Food was excellent. I had the best chicken Tajine in my whole 28 days! Right in the middle of the medina so great access to Rabat. Lots of locals so shopping isn't a leisure activity! Very friendly and a shame our last Moroccan riad. Could have stayed longer Thanks"
 May 2017,5,One night in Rabat,"I visited Rabat very quickly with a small group, as part of a 7 day toor in Morocco. My only regret is not having stayed longer in this lovely Riad! The staff was very kind and attentive, the food was EXCELLENT, and the accomodation very elegant and cozy. If I ever come back to Rabat, I would definitely return to Zyo to enjoy more of this delightful hotel."
 October 2016,5,Great stopover at beginning of Morocco trip,"My wife and I stayed here after flying into Morocco to begin our 10 day trip in the country. Great room, excellent dinner and a very welcoming host all made our first riad stay in country an excellent tone-setter for the trip. Well located and relaxing."
 March 2017,5,Delightful Riad,"Zyo was our first riad in our three week tour of Morocco. Like other reviewers have written, it is a small riad with rooms facing a pool/courtyard that is beautifully lit at night. Our room though small was comfortable and our bathroom well laid out and modern. We loved the breakfast...so many enticing treats with an additional omelet offered. Best of all was the welcoming staff. Enis couldn't have given us a better introduction to his city and Morocco. He was delightful and by following his suggestions our two days were full of wonderful discoveries and adventures. It was a fifteen minute interesting and safe walk to most restaurants."
 April 2017,4,"Excellent Riad, centrally located","We arrived here very late at night, after flying into Casablanca and then driving on to Rabat. It was close to 11.00 PM, but the manager was up waiting for us, offered to cook a full meal, which we declined, served us with a delicious snack and served us wine. The Riad is small, traditional in that it faces inwards, and on 3 levels. Inside is a pool, sitting area and eating area which is modern. The kitchen is off to the side from the meals area. Some Riads serve alcohol some do not. This one does. Breakfast is excellent, with a lot of choices based on traditional Moroccan food... dates, bread, olives, honey, pastries, mint tea. Rooms are quite small, but well laid out and you don't feel squashed in. Bed is a queen and the bathroom is well laid out with a large shower and…"
 April 2017,3,Comfortable,"Good service, good food in a small yet comfortable riad. The only criticism is the very, very noisy crowd on the street just beneath our window on a Sunday night until the wee hours of the morning made sleeping very difficult."
 March 2017,4,Nice Riad with friendly staff.,"Stayed only one night in this beautiful little riad. Friendly and with high standard of hospitality. Nice breakfast and comfortable rooms. Overall its a small riad, just like many authentic riad in morocco, which also what gives Zyo a homely and soothing environment. Recommended."
 March 2017,5,Excellent hospitality,"This was the first Riad we stayed in in Morocco and every other Riad had a hard job to measure up to Zyo. The staff were incredibly welcoming and polite. The atmosphere was calm and modern and all areas clean. Dinner was excellent and there were options instead of the ubiquitous Tagine and Couscous. Not only that, they also had alcohol which was a problem at some other establishments - remember to ask if a tipple is part of your evening enjoyment. Then there was breakfast which was sublime. The only niggle was that the sliding bathroom door did not close completely, with the bad closing bit right by the bed head."
 March 2017,5,Very nice place.,"Very very gentil and helpfull people. Good location for visiting the city.Clean and Well decorated rooms.Our Son went ill and nothing was too much.they made special food for him, arranged a very good doctor.I very recommand this place."
 February 2017,4,Clean and modern with an excellent breakfast,"What a nice hotel. It's sleek and modern and very clean. As with many riads, it is small. The staff was very helpful and spoke English well. The free breakfast was filling - a variety of breads, jams and teas. It also included an egg omelette, yogurt with fresh strawberries, fresh orange juice and a small cheese sandwich. The Wi-Fi in our secind floor room was a little choppy and our bathroom door did not close all the way. That would be my only conplaints. Other than that, I think it was an excellent place to stay."
 February 2017,5,Superior quality facilities and hospitality,"From the moment Asan met us at the curb (to show us the way to the door and carry our luggage), we we warmly embraced in the comforts of this charming and trendy riad. Asan is engaging and intelligent and shared much about his life in this city and his country. Osama continued to be a conversationalist enlightening us further. And Mohammed provided fine service at our meals. And I do recommend having dinner at Riad Zyo; the food is expertly prepared and authentic. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with everything that we needed to be comfortable and safe. Kudos to Ali and his staff for a very well run and situated riad. Thank you all!!"
 January 2017,5,"Cozy rooms, great food","Staying here felt like being a special guest in a relative's home with all the amenities available at bigger chain hotels. The rooms were clean with plenty of closet space, and the meals we had here were among the best we've ever had. Their ingredients are market fresh every day, and each dining experience felt personalized. From the moment we walked in to the time we left, extraordinarily kind staff members made sure all our needs were met, even serving us each our own individual pots of mint tea while we waited for our rooms to be ready. The riad is also near many of Rabat's main attractions and in the middle of a bustling corridor."
 December 2016,5,Morden riad,"Morden riad located in the side street of a busy main street in rabat. Pity we didn't make use of swimming pool because its too cold. Room is nice and warm. Soundproofing could be better, but it didn't bother us. Tasty breakfast."
 December 2016,4,Cozy Riad,"We stayed for one night. We were welcomed with mint tea and snacks. Helpful staff brought our bags upstairs and offered us directions to a local restaurant. Room overlooked the pool and was small but very comfortable. The breakfast the next day was excellent. We were served three courses: pastry, eggs and yummy breads, and fruit!"
 November 2016,5,Great Place to Stay in Rabat!,"We spent two nights at Riad Zyo on arrival to Morocco and after two weeks and half dozen other riads, I have to say that Zyo definitely was one of the better places we stayed at. The room was big enough, the heat was sufficient (we were there at the end of November), all of the fixtures were in good working order, comfortable bed, strong water pressure, good Wi-Fi signal and a really good breakfast. The staff was friendly, spoke English well, and helped with many things. And the location was great – the little alley Zyo is located on is just off Mohammed V Avenue, the main street in the medina. So when we came out of our rooms there were plenty of food options, retail services, etc. Finally, I have to say something about the décor – most of the riads we stayed at went for the…"
 November 2016,5,Lovely home away from home,"Every time we visit Rabat, we stay in Riad Zyo, and every time it is a fantastic experience. The owner Ali and his staff are very welcoming and such lovely people. The rooms are very comfortable and the food is just delicious. Don't go anywhere else for dinner, this is the best! Also breakfast is delicious and every time a surprise for the senses. In short: the best place to stay in Rabat is Riad Zyo."
 October 2016,5,Lovely read,"We stayed here in Oct 2016. The riad is a very pleasan surprise. It is small but very light and airy. Our room was quite ,well appointed , clean. The staff is wonderful. The food was very good! We only stayed one night but if were in Rabat again would pick this riad again."
 November 2016,5,A lovely Riad - wonderful people - terrific food. A fantastic introduction to Morocco!,"Located at the north end of the medina, in easy walking distance to the Kasbah and ocean shore, Riad Zyo is a lovely property that puts you right on the edge of the bustle of the medina, yet far away from the noise. The staff - Simo, Bushra, Ali, Abdel, Alex - was cordial, helpful, and went out of their way to help us on several occasions, even accompanying us into the medina to help us secure a bit of calligraphy from a particular artist. They prepared a sensational meal for us at our request one evening - Fatija is an absolute genius in the kitchen. My only quibble is that the air circulation in our room was not the best - we had to choose between air movement and evening noise. When I go again (which, hopefully, I will), I'll probably ask for an interior room to see if…"
 October 2016,5,Wonderful,"I had been to Marrakesh and Casablanca but it wasn't until I arrived at Zhou that I felt I was in Morocco! The team are welcoming, genuinely friendly, speak great English and couldn't have been nicer. A perfect combination of traditional Morocco and modern interior design in the beautiful hotel, and the freshly prepared food was outstanding. Such care taken of every detail. I look forward to going back."
 September 2016,5,"Very good hotel,excellent location, friendly staff",a very pleasent and comfortable riad in the heart of rabat. very close to kasbah ouda and all the other nice places in rabat. the manager was very kind to help us with our luggage and the staff was very helpful and nice..the food was delicious and endless supply of moroccan tea..
 August 2016,5,Great Place to Stay,"We stayed at Riad Zyo one night at the start of our Morocco tour. We found this place clean, comfortable and quiet. It was close to restaurants and we found a great one within walking distance. The breakfast was good and the staff very helpful. We would not hesitate to recommend this riad for your stay in Rabat."
 August 2016,5,Pacha Room - 2 nights,"Rabat marked the end of our trip across Morocco, so we booked Riad Zyo for a luxurious finish to our journey. We were definitely not disappointed! From the moment we arrived, we were made welcome. As our bus to Rabat arrived early our room was not ready at the Riad. This was not a problem; we offered mint tea and relaxed by the pool until the room was ready. Pacha is a lovely room with a huge super king bed and patio doors overlooking a garden and the swimming pool. Breakfast was delicious- with more than enough food and endless supplies of tea and coffee! A true paradise located in the bustling medina of Rabat. On our last night we were out exploring the city late. We came back to the Riad to find a bedside light & air-conditioning on and our bed turned down! A home away…"
 July 2016,5,A gateway to Paradise.,"A gateway to Paradise. A sublime corner in Rabat that you do not expect. A world of colors and a glowing white that illuminates hearts and minds. A place to spend time hoping that the endo of your stay willi never come. If you want to delight the palate, then you should have a dinner with the owner and he will surprise you with the typical Moroccan dishes."
 June 2016,5,Very modern riad in the heart of the Medina!,"This is a very modern riad, with white walls and clean lines. It doesn't have the ornate styling of say a Marrakech riad. The rooms are very comfortable with decent showers and quality beds. There's a/c as standard and the rooftop sunlounging area is excellent. The only thing I would improve is the strength of the wifi in our rooms, it was patchy and dropped frequently. Recommended in Rabat!"
 June 2016,5,Riad zyo,"Lovely place! Rooms are very nice, the window opens & looks over onto a street ally in Rabat. Dinner isn't included in the price, small dinning room but food is good, the roof has very nice relaxing seating and has more than what is pictured. By the looks of the hotel you would have no idea it's off of the busy streets of Rabat"
 April 2016,5,Great Riad To Start Our Morocco Trip,"Riad Zyo is located just inside the medina walls off a small alley that was a little hard to find even for our guide. We had to walk several blocks from a major street since the roads leading there were too narrow for cars to navigate easily. We stayed here our first two evenings in Morocco and soon discovered this type of location was typical if we wanted to be “close to the action”. The change from the street views of the riad to the interior of the building was quite amazing. Having once stepped inside, we were surprised at how modern it was. The entrance to Riad Zyo opens to a small pool in the center of the ground floor area with a view to the top that reveals the open sky. Riad Zyo is traditionally decorated and spotless throughout. There is also a rooftop garden…"
 May 2016,5,Great service and location,"We stayed here while visiting our college aged daughter who was living with a family nearby. This location in the medina was close to attractions and shopping in the market, and the staff was most kind and helpful. The facility and food is quite good and the rooftop deck has a small lawn with chaises and a lavender hedge that perfumes the area."
 May 2016,4,"Nice place, friendly staff","Arrived at Riad Zyo tired from very long journey from San Francisco. Warm welcome by the nice young man at the desk and he showed us to our rooms right away given our fatigue. SF and franly expected something a bit more upscale. Zyo is in theheart of the medina but just off the main street so easy to find. My single room was equipped with dbl/queen bed and bathroom with one sink, shower in a tub. Window looked out on ramshackle house next door. Flat screen TV with wifi in the room. Used the wifi but never could get the TV to work. User error, I think. Also has a hairdryer in the bathroon. Lots of bottled water. Most off-putting thing was faint smell of mold/dankness in the room. Very nice dinner served by Abdel...moroccan salads, sea bass with lovely veggies, and…"
 April 2016,5,Simply Magnificent,It is the first time to be in a Riad and I admit it won't be the last. It is wonderful experience. It is too calm no noise. Room is well furnished not modern but very nice. Staff are too friendly. Breakfast is served hot and every day they surprise me. Location is inside Medina but not that far from streets. I will strongly recommend staying in this particular Riad.
 April 2016,3,"Good riad, though problem with arranging airport taxi","We stayed one night at Riad Zyo. The riad and room were very modern and nice and the staff was generally helpful. When we arrived, we asked the staff to arrange for a taxi to the Casablanca airport for early the next morning. They didn't do it. The staff who was there in the morning told us maybe there was a misunderstanding and the person at the front desk thought we were going to arrange the taxi. I honestly can't imagine a scenario where that could have been the understanding. In any case, they were able to arrange for a taxi in the morning, but because of the 45 minute delay we barely made it to the airport in time for our flight. I would have given them a 5 star rating, but for the taxi problem."
 March 2016,5,Exceptional,"The Riad Zyo is a beautifully renovated riad. The overall design is elegant and uplifting as are the rooms which are light and spacious. Both breakfast and dinner were exceptional if not exquisite in their content, preparation and presentation. The owner pays personal attention to the running of the riad welcoming the guests and overseeing the restaurant. Overall, it was a delightful place to stay and we would thoroughly recommend the Riad Zyo to travellers to Rabat."
 March 2016,5,Gem in Rabat,"We arrived at sunset and the Zyo was a perfect respite from the frenetic traffic of Rabat at rush hour. We were given a welcome tea in the sitting area near the pool in the center of the Riad and greeted by our lovely hostess. The music was chill house and I noticed the great art collection and clearly fresh renovation. Our rooms were truly beautiful. Fresh linens and towels, wall heaters that were clean and quiet, clean large bathrooms with quality amenities and little chocolates and fresh roses. The roof top garden is a treat and the friendly owner welcomed us with a delicious dinner of lamb tajine in their gorgeous dining room. We will return!"
 March 2016,5,Absolutely the best riad in Rabat!,"If you are coming to Rabat you will not be disappointed with riad zyo! The riad was clean, the dinner and breakfast were excellent, and the owner was very welcoming. It is conveniently located in the medina and close to all of the shopping. Absolutely the best riad in Rabat!"
 February 2016,5,Beautiful riad in the medina,This is a small but beautiful riad in the medina. The grounds are nice. They have a small pool in the middle of the riad and a rooftop terrace upstairs. The staff is very helpful and friendly. It is like being in another world when the busy Rabat medina is outside your door.
 January 2016,5,Fabulous Place to Stay in Rabat,"ZYO is a very special place to stay in Morocco. It is a new, modern riad built by the owner and host, Ali. Combining very modern architecture with traditional features Ali has created a real retreat from the bustle of Rabat. The food is truly excellent and the staff very helpful and friendly. If you have an interest in art just chat to Ali- he is an active patron of some brilliant young Moroccan artists such as Khalid, the new Picasso!"
 December 2015,4,Very beautifull and modern,"It is extremly beautifull, very nice and modern. It had a very big and nice breakfast. We didin`t use the pool because it was winter but it looked so nice. The only thing is that we arrived late and couldn`t get dinner at the riad and there are no nice places to eat around. That is why we don`t give the 5 stars..."
 December 2015,5,Exceptionally beautiful Riad in Rabat!!,"Riad Zyo has spoilt us beyond imagination. From their warm hospitality, to their detailed modern decor, and very comfortable rooms at a reasonable price - everything was perfect!! The location is by far the easiest to find and remember. Breakfast was plenty and custom suited. In room heaters were helpful in this chilly winter. The entrance is standard, but as soon as doors were opened, it was a different world inside."
 November 2015,5,Great first night in Morocco,"We flew into Casablanca and after seeing the great mosque drove onto Rabat and stayed one night at Zyo. The riad was sparkling. The room and most importantly the bed was firm and comfortable. The staff was eager to help and directed us to a good Moroccan restaurant nearby. Zyo was off the Main Street and quiet. We have now traveled 11 days in Morocco staying at different Riads and Zyo's breakfast has been the best so far -Fresh pastries, eggs, and tastey yogurt/fruit cup."
 October 2015,5,one of the best riads in Morocco,"We stayed here the first and last night of our trip. The hotel is a such a peaceful oasis in the city. the open courtyard with a pool, the lovely mint tea, the best breakfast we had in Morocco. The room was a good size, the bed comfortable, great shower. No hesitations recommending this. On the last morning we met the owner, who was very nice and really goes all out to make your stay comfortable."
 October 2015,4,Wish we could have stayed long,"Very professionally run, very modernistic Riad unlike many others we experienced in other centres of Morocco. Very comfortable. Great location.Great service. Very tranquil and peaceful. Gourmet dinners ( Moroccan dishes) served by the owner with real flare. You can even book a great massage or Hammam at a reasonable price. Would definitely return, and highly recommend it."
 September 2015,5,A very personal experience,"Riad Zyo was our first stop on our trip to Morocco. If the remainder of our stays are as good as this we will be very pleased. We were fortunate to be at Riad Zyo through a weekend. This meant the owner Ali was on sight, spending a considerable amount of time telling us about the Riad (it was originally a post office), his dream of owning a guesthouse and his efforts restoring the building. Our room on the ground floor, Kaid, was very nice with a large bathroom. There are larger rooms on the second level but we actually choose this room as it appealed to us – attractively decorated. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. WiFi in both the room and common areas is good. One shortcoming in the room was the absence of end tables near the bed, somewhere to put one’s…"
 October 2015,5,Relaxing spot in middle of medina,"We had a great time here. Friendly english speaking staff, clean rooms and environment. The owner really tried to build a nice hotel for his guests with nice architecture. Beautifull bathrooms. Only the bed in our room was bit small for us tall people. Though they have biger beds in the other rooms."
 September 2015,5,Perfect beginning to a perfect holiday,"Rabat, and Riad Zyo, was our first stop of an 11-day trip across the country, and what an amazing start it was. Perfectly located, Riad zyo is just off the main street of the Medina meaning the souks and everything you could possibly want are just a short walk away. You can see from the contemperary design that the owner of the riad, Ali, is a lover of modern art. The traditional home is full of modern touches with impressive art works contrasting the beautiful handcarved, original doors. Rooms are light and spacious, with excellent bathrooms. We spent plenty of time reading on the amazing rooftop terrace, with every morning in the sun following a tasty (and hearty!) breakfast of traditional delicacies. Rabat is a truly underrated destination but if you're heading there…"
 September 2015,5,Relaxing place in the Medina of Rabat,Nice riad in the Rabat medina. Very relaxing at the pool or on the rooftop after a busy day visiting Rabat. Owner and staff members are very friendly and helpful. We had dinner once and found it very tasty and good. Also breakfast is quite enjoyable.
 September 2015,5,Amazing start of the trip,"a wonderful spread of food provided, especially the breakfast. the whole concept and design of the riad was just breathtaking and peaceful in the middle of old medina. the people there were very helpful in making sure we had the best stay possible in Rabat. They also provide free wifi for all the guests and when we arrived at the riad, were welcomed by their traditional moroccon tea and delicacies."
 August 2015,5,"Exceellent stay, wonderful surprise!","Riad Zyo was a wonderful surprise! First of all is perfectly located in the Medina of Rabat, with a secured parking closeby, therefore a perfect pick for us traveling by car! The riad has been carefully conceived: a modern interpretation of the traditional house with an inner courtyard, all the rooms have been designed to offer a very comfortable stay to its guests. Spacious, comfy large bed, large wardrobes, good climatised ambience and beautiful decoration. I loved their doors: nice handcarved decorated doors with a whitewashed surface: emblematic of the use of traditional materials with a contemporary twist. Nice roof garden, I believe that 2 of the rooms have windows directly on it. We didn't have dinner but breakfast was very delicious, with a good presentation of various…"
 September 2015,5,beautiful hotel fantastic people,loved the hotel and the experience i had there would recommend it to anyone wish i could of stayed more then 2 days but i will defiantly come back again everyone made us feel so welcome and everything was clean loved every minute
 August 2015,5,Hidden Oasis in the Medina,"Wonderful stay for our first night in Morocco. Clean, ultra-modern design, a spacious room, extra friendly and helpful staff. We enjoyed a delicious fish dinner with tasty Moroccan appetizers and dessert. Breakfast was even better - lots of Moroccan delicacies. Beautiful bath, crisp beds. Peaceful repose just steps from the bustling Broadway of the medina. Highly recommended."
 August 2015,5,Fabulous stay in Rabat's medina!,"This riad was everything we hoped for and more! The rooms and facilities were clean, with a sharp, modern look. Not a gigantic room, but it had everything we needed. It's located in the center of the medina, a very bustling and convenient area. It's not too far from where taxis can drop you off, so you won't have to carry your luggage a long ways. The breakfast was great. The proprietor came to say hello each morning and gave us maps and recommendations on where to go and eat. I highly recommend staying here if you're in Rabat!"
 June 2015,5,The Perfect Rabat Riad,"Set within the medina walls, the Riad Zyo is a gem. It was our first night in Morocco, and we were pleasantly surprised, after a walk through the narrow streets, to discover this modern riad. Small with only 7 rooms, it has the B&B feel, with a Moroccan twist. Clean rooms & friendly staff, delicious tagine dinner & traditional breakfast were included, as is free wifi. There is a beautiful wading pool in the center courtyard. We only stayed for one night, and wished we had more time to enjoy the amenities."
 May 2015,3,Great location ~ decent Riad,"There were 4 of us on a JBT tour, and we had a quick one night stay in Rabat. This Riad has a great location inside the Medina (although dragging our luggage was a bit of a challenge) ~ great for walking to all the sights. The design is traditional/modern- very clean, but somewhat boring after the amazing places we stayed in Marrakech & Fes. We had a very small room - tight to walk around, with an even smaller bathroom and hard, crunchy towels. ( Our friends definitely had the better, bigger room). It had those terrible, attached hangars in the closet (why do hotels keep using those???) and there were fingerprints on the drinking glasses. We did enjoy having a drink on the rooftop terrasse, and while the dining area is small and a bit dark, the meal at dinner was very…"
 April 2015,5,Wonderful place to stay,"My friend & I stayed here (booked with Journey Beyond Travel) after a 22 hr flight from Melbourne, Australia and we stayed 2 nights. The charming host spoke to us at length and made us feel very welcome. We had delightful food & it was a great introduction to Morocco culture. Riad is beautiful, restful and very chic. Staff were so friendly. The rooftop & dear little garden had a great view over the city and the pool and courtyard was stunning. We just loved our stay."
 April 2015,5,A wonderful welcome to Morocco,"After a long trip from California, we entered a wonderful ""home"". Ali greeted us with warmth and helpful tips . We opted to have dinner here as we had traveled so far. We had a fresh green salad with homemade goat cheese, tomatoes and cashews. The main course was a chicken tagging with specially prepared olives. Pastries and orange sorbet followed. During dinner we were warmly greeted by the owner, Ali, who was most welcoming. The room and reception areas are decorated with lovely paintings and ""chic"" decor. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. This could not have been a more wonderful introduction to Morocco!"
 March 2015,5,Lovely riad,"This riad is a great combo of modern and traditional Moroccan design. It has a very cool courtyard and rooftop and our room was cozy but comfortable. The best part, though, was the service. We stayed here for our first night in Morocco and the owner of the riad sat with us after dinner and shared lots of information about the country and the city. It was a great way to start the trip. Zyo also has a great breakfast that regularly changes to highlight a different region of the country. This place really is a little gem in Rabat's medina."
 March 2015,4,"Contemporary, classic.",This Riad was a pleasant surprise as our contact person walked us past the Medina souks to the entry. We had a lovely experience of sitting on the roof top during a full moon. The Manager was willing to answer questions and chat with us about our upcoming journey. The food was good and all staff interactions were professional and pleasant.
 December 2014,5,"chic, elegant and relaxing","This Riad is a quiet respite just off a busy shopping street which is fun to walk along. Service is attentive, quiet and respectful. Is it modern and chic, but retains and utilizes much local flavor and design in its decor. I felt I had walked into a modern art photo shoot set, Moroccan style. In late December we seemed to have the place to ourselves -- but nonetheless had a generous, beautifully served breakfast and a wonderful dinner served in tagines. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay there again. Rabat is an interesting city with much to see."
 December 2014,5,"Classy, modern, and cool ryad!",Lovely ryad - minimalist and interesting decor. The staff was very friendly and the dinner and breakfast were excellent. Centrally located and fun to walk up and down the lively street that the hotel is just off of.
 November 2014,5,Gorgeous modern riad,"Love the gorgeous modern decor and landscaping. Welcoming atmosphere. Rooftop access Good amenities. Gracious host and staff. Delicious, bountiful breakfast that was served. Would have loved to have dinner there..."
 December 2014,5,"Beautiful, Chic and Peaceful Riad","Absolutely adored Riad Zyo. Great ambiance, and very peaceful away from the outside hustle and bustle of Rabat. Beautiful and tranquil rooftop space for relaxing. Delicious Moroccan food with a slight twist. The owner, Mr. Chraibi Ali and his staff were warm and very welcoming. If you ever need information about things to do in Rabat, they are always able to give suggestions in regards to places and things to check out. Wish I was able to stay longer at Riad Zyo. Highly recommended, and will most definitely come back to stay when I’m in Morocco next."
 October 2014,4,Feel Welcome,"Arrived at the riad after about 18 hours flight from Kuala Lumpur to Paris and thereon to Rabat. Finding the riad is not a problem and the first person to greet us on arrival is the lovely Oumnia. She is very helpfull and kind, catered for all our needs during the 3 days we stayed at the riad. I have stayed at riad in Fez before and while this is not as beautiful, the excellence service and kindness of staff and owner makes our visit a memorable one."
 October 2014,5,deluxe,"Nice birthday stay, right in the center of Rabat Medina, beautiful and luxury decor, we had such a great time. Room spacious, amazing breakfast and amazing staff, very well managed. I hope we could stay more! Highly recommended"
 October 2014,5,Unforgettable wonderful breakfasts,"RIAD ZYO - We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay at the very modern and clean and well-run Riad Zyo, especially because the breakfasts that Omnia served were the best we had during our entire trip; so unique, so tasty, so special. Th only thing we regretted was that we were not aware that we could order dinner there, as well."
 October 2014,5,"Chic, modern riad - lovely!","This was one of the best places we stayed in, in Morocco. It's a great location, easy to find and access, in the Rabat medina. It is a modern, comfortable, beautiful place. The rooms are well-sized with functional decor and great bathrooms. The staff is very helpful, the taxi service for the airport is very convenient and the breakfast is plentiful and good."
 October 2014,5,A hidden gem in the Moroccan capital,"With a new flight route launched from London we decided to take a long weekend break to the Moroccan capital Rabat. Riad Zyo made our weekend very special. It is truly fabulous retreat in the Medina, the comments on Trip Advisor left by previous guests are totally justifiable. We took advantage of the taxi service offered by the team at 'Zyo' as we were arriving after dark from the airport, a member of staff greeted us on the street on 'Mohammed V' and personally escorted us to the Riad, this level of service and expertise prevailed throughout the duration of our stay. Breakfasts each morning, of which we consumed 3, were innovative, tasty and imaginative. Everything is home cooked. Our room was clean and there is great attention to detail, fresh towels provided every…"
 September 2014,5,Very comfortable Riad,"We stayed here for 2 nights in September and enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful; the rooms were clean and comfortable. We only had breakfast, but the food was more than adequate. The Riad is well located for the Medina and also for local restaurants. We have no hesitation in recommending this Riad and would definitely return."
 September 2014,5,The best of the best,"I am writing this review in the last night of stay in this outstanding riad, as I cannot wait to share our experience. There are no words to express the perfection of this place. I have to mention that I have been all over the world, and I came to Rabat in a business trip that was transformed in the most beautiful experience, due to this riad and its wonderful people. The riad is imagined as a modern moroccan environment, but having also just the right amount of traditional flavour. The rooms are spotless and the beds huge and so relaxing to sleep in. The riad has also a terrace with sun beds in a garden. Yes, a garden on the roof! We had breakfast and dinner each day, and I could say this was by far the highlight of the stay. The owner of the riad took care of us every time…"
 August 2014,5,Fantastic experience,The Riad is brand new and has all the comforts of a modern structure within the atmosphere of a typical Riad. We had a fantastic lunch and a 100% delicious marochine breakfast. The staff is very kind and has called for us a tourist guide who has organized an unforgettable visit of Rabat. Highly recommended!
 July 2014,5,Rabat old town perle,"The Riad Zyo is in the heart of the Medina, the old town of Rabat and is not so easy to find (we got help from several local people to be able to find it), but when you nfind it you immediately feel yourself as at home because the staff are all so nice and helpful and the rooms are clean and really nice. We were there during the Ramadan, but the staff helped to make a great experience as we always could get ready good and tasty food there (breakfast and lunches) and there is also a roof garden where you can relax and enjoy the quietness of this place in the middle to the old town. You have to walk to/from the hotel, but when you have found out how to get there then it is easy to find your way and you are close to all then places you have to see in Rabat. The WiFi works well, but…"
 June 2014,5,Fastastic stay!,"What a wonderful stay my daughter and I had here. Easy to get to from the airport via taxi (someone from the riad meets you at your taxi stop at the end of the street and takes you to the riad). Beautiful rooms, sumptuous breakfasts, amazing dinners and the friendliest most accommodating staff! Can you tell we loved it here?"
 June 2014,5,"Spectacular riad, lovely owner","As others have said, this riad is beautifully renovated and an oasis in the medina. We stayed in several riads in our trip to Morocco and this was by far, the nicest. At the end of a two week trip, it was a respite. The service was excellent. The owner is completely charming and helpful and really has a pride of ownership in the work that he has done. He is an art lover and it shows in the riad and when you talk with him. He oversees a wonderful staff who are really helpful. We couldn't have had a nicer place to stay in Rabat."
 May 2014,5,Beyond expectations,"From the first moment we stepped inside Riad Zyo, we knew we were in for a special treat. Albeit the decor could be a surprise for those that are expecting a traditional riad, the elegance of the place, the suspended gardens, the pool and the views more than compensate. The meal we had was surely the best one we ever had in Rabat and we visited the city quite a few times. It started with a figs - and - goat cheese salad, was followed by the tenderest beef and prunes tagine while the dessert was an almond pastilla. While the delicious Moroccan cuisine can sometimes be a little heavy, this meal was perfectly adapted to the outside temperatures, light yet to-die-for.The breakfast is the perfect introduction to the endless list of Moroccan pastries and pancakes and honestly, you are…"
 April 2014,5,Well taken care of,Riad Zyo is beautifully furnished haven of peace in the medina of Rabat. The staff were very attentive to our needs. Great home made breakfast. The riad is well located and close to everything in and around the medina. The white walls against the blue skies were refreshing. The rooftop balcony was anise quiet spot to relax. Excellent choice of a place to stay in Rabat
 April 2014,5,A touch of traditionalism and modernity in one.,"Too bad we stayed here for just a night. This by far was the best riad that I have stayed while in Morocco for 8 days. Right from the outside, you would know that this place will provide a feeling of luxury for your stay. What's also great is that the location is just along an alley off the main street where you can buy cheap stuff and food if you need to. We were greeted by this traditionally constructed riad with an oomph of modernity. Although the place was a bit small, every detail that was put into it you can see was carefully thought of. Service was also impeccable and the staff are very nice. They also speak very good english. The rooms were very comfortable and you know that the beds and sheets are not the cheap kind. It was a very nice room with a touch of modern…"
 April 2014,5,Perfect riad in a perfect town,"The moment we arrived, we knew that one day wouldn't be enough. The room was excellent and the hospitality unparalleled. We were just stopping over for the night, but could've easily enjoyed several days of vacation in Rabat. The rooms are small but cozy and the satellite tv was a little touchy, but everything else about this little gem was perfect."
 March 2014,5,Magic,"We stayed four nights here and found it to be the most relaxing place to come back to after a day of sight-seeing. We had two delicious evening meals and were introduced to some very fine Moroccan wines, something that is not a given in Moroccan restaurants, most of which do not serve alcohol. The owner, Ali, and his staff are terrific and the decor is very stylish. We thoroughly recommend."
 January 2014,5,Wonderful,We only stayed at Riad Zyo for one night but we had a wonderful experience nonetheless. We were able to arrange to be picked up from the train station and the owner came along with a driver. Another young man carted our bags for us which was very helpful. We even got upgraded at no extra charge. Everyone at the riad was extremely friendly and helpful. The riad itself is modern and very beautiful and nicely decorated. Our room was cozy and very clean. Heat (we were there in January) and wifi worked well. Breakfast provided a lot of variety and was one of the best we had in two weeks in Morocco.
 January 2014,5,Fabulous,"We stayed 1 night at riad zyo. Spotless, comfortable & really friendly staff. Central location in the medina in rabat with secure parking nearby.Breakfast was typically Moroccan. Excellent coffee! Sonya Ireland"
 December 2013,5,Comfortable stay,"We stayed a night and adter traveling across Morocco with TV showing only Local, French and German tv, the most important hing about this riad is not the friendly staff, nor the comfortable room, but the TV which has plenty of English satellite channels. The room is spacious and the service great. The breakfast was typical Moroccan and nothing special. The location is 5 mins walking from the Kasbah, on the north of the Medina, away from the hustle but a 5 min walking to the souks."
 October 2013,4,Nice change,Riad Zyo is a very modern take on the traditional Moroccan Riads. It seems like it's new so it's quite clean and fixtures etc are quite modern. The room was very comfortable. The courtyard in the centre has a plunge pool. I'm not sure if this is meant to be a hotel for business travelers more than tourists as they really don't provide any information on sights etc in Rabat. Ali at the front desk was alright. He lent us a map of Rabat for our time there. There were only two drawbacks...one - we asked for a transfer from the train station and they advised us to take a cab instead. we did that but then the cab couldn't find the place even after we had got directions from the Riad itself. We got dropped off a little ways away. However after we found a nice person to call the…
 September 2013,5,Simplicity is beauty,"We spent a night in Rabat as a halfway point to Fes, since we couldn't find any accommodation we liked at a reasonable price in Casablanca. We arrived late and left early in the morning, so there wasn't enough time for us to fully explore the Riad and the surrounding. But from the short time we were there, we could feel the warmth of the host and the staff. They were very attentive and welcoming, and answered to our needs almost immediately. We booked the Ambre Double Room on the ground floor, it was modern, clean, comfortable and brightly-lit. We didn't realize there was no air-conditioner in this room until we arrived. Fortunately, the temperature at night was crisp and cool, and we slept soundly with the fan on. Shower was nice, water pressure and temperature very…"
 August 2013,5,"Great Riad excellent service, nice people.","We have visited riad Zyo last month, it was divine. Service was excellent, the owner was very nice aswell as the staff. Good food, just discuss a meal with the staff or owner and let them surprise you (they know how to cook). We reserved the Room Ambre, when we arrived at the Riad the owner told us that he had upgraded the room to one of the best in the Riad (Pacha) without extra costs, this kind of service is exactly what we lack here in europe. The location is perfect, and there is no noise at all from outside or anything. Best Riad in Rabat!"
 August 2013,4,"New structure, elegant and confortable","We stayed here one night, the furniture are new and elegant but not typical Moroccan., the service is excellent, the location is good because the riad is inside the medina but very easy to be found.There is a small swimming pool , very nice, the only problem is that near the swimming pool there is no space for laying in the sun, the solarium is located on the terrace, 2 floors up. The breakfast is good."
 July 2013,5,A truely amazing place,"This riad shows the difference between service and hospitality. The owner and personnel were so kind and helpful, better than the other five riads we have visited around Marocco. The riad has just opened six months ago. Everyting is brand new, a mix of modern and Maroccan style in the heart of the medina just of Av. Mohammed V. Breakfast is great and the beds are really comfortable. A must stay in Rabat without a doubt!"
 June 2013,5,"Riad Zyo - friendly and welcoming staff at astunning riad,","Only open 5 months, so a bit of a secret gem! Initially planned to stay in Rabat for only 2 days but the riad staff and owner were so welcoming and friendly, decided to extend stay. We would have stayed longer if time had allowed. The rooms are very clean and in excellent state of decoration - and big! I've stayed in riads before where the rooms are quite small. Riad Zyo rooms and en suite are a very decent size. Ali deserves special mention for his positive attitude towards hospitality. If you are staying in Rabat, I urge you to give Zyo a go. PS - if you follow the map and short instructions the riad provide with reservation confirmation, you will have no trouble finding the riad at all!"
 April 2013,5,Owesome place,"This Riad is conveniently located inside the Medina, the place is extremely clean and well decorated. The staff is great and the owner is very kind. He recommended a Moroccan restaurant for us and even walked us to the place. Only recommendation as others pointed out already is the lack of signs to find the place. If you come at night you are likely to spend a long time looking for it. Thanks! Martin"
 April 2013,4,Perfect stay in rabat,"This Riad is really clean, stylish and personnels is very kind. The only think we can advise to them is to put a label on the main street to let the arrival easier...:-) ..We walked around the place half an hour at least asking and asking...It was a fortune we found the place. There isn't the number 5 on the door, too..:-(. The breakfast was healthy and fresh. The service perfect. One of the boys at the reception walked with us to the parking place to be sure that we don't have any trouble for our expired car ticket (they made us a fine only for 15 minutes of delay), but paying the day fare everything was ok. We advice this place for sure!"
 April 2013,5,This Riad should have a category of it's own!,"What a find! This should be called ""Luxury Boutique Riad"" and not a Bed and Breakfast. It is way past that! First the decor is very well thought out: not overwhelming with morocco, but just enough to have a taste of it. I can't get over the beauty of the copper wire curtains we had! The rooms are all comfortably big, with great closets and space to put your luggage away. It had a fantastic bathroom with great amenities and good hot water, comfortable bed and soft cotton linens. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious, one of the best we had during our trip. They also have a beautiful terrace (with a lawn!) to chill out after a long day. Best part was that the owner was there to attend all your needs. He would recommend places to visit and shop. You can tell he is a well travelled…"
 April 2013,5,Luxury riad in rabat,"I think the best riad in Rabat if you are looking for a luxuy place. Ali, the guest is always very caring about all your needs and his very helpful for Any information about the city. The rooms are such a dream , mixture of european design with typical marocan style. Perfect if you want to treat yourself and enjoy all the things that Rabat can offer because the riad is very well located. Breakfast is delicious with an excellent variety of marocan pastries and lots more. Don't hesitate to ask him to prepare a dinner for you it will be lovely! And least but not last, is best quality for a very reasonable price. We are looking forward to come back."
 February 2013,5,The ultimate experience ...,"What a nice discover y ... This Riad, despite Rabat is not really a touristic place, deserves the trip for itself. And spend a couple of days to relax and discover the medina of Rabat. The Riad is brand new, extremely confortable ... and decorated with charm and a lot of taste. Everywhere you feel this taste and the little attention that makes the difference. From the terrace a wonderful view over the city. The owner is a passionate ... and was able, which is rare, to gather around him people with the same attention the details and friendly / professional behaviour. Take dinner or lunch there: Ali is doing fanstastic cuisine. And loves to discuss about it. Just a great experience. A place that you would like to keep just for you ... When travelling around the wordl it is…"
 January 2013,5,Wonderful place to stay,"I just spent two nights at this charming Riad. Ali the owner and Ali the manager are most welcoming and extremely helpful. I was a pleasure to share stories and learn about the rich Moroccan culture from them.fro I felt completely at home is this amazingly tasteful envireronment. It is a brand new building, so conveniently located in the Medina. I was in the Fez room. Discreet clasic style, impeccably appointed and the fresh flowers continued to bloom during my stay. I enjoyed the fresh fruit offered in my room on my arrival. And the breakfast is a delicious array of traditional Moroccan crepes and pancakes as well as fresh croissant and perfectlyt brewed coffee. Having acces to wi-fi was a special bonus on the rainy morning of my first day. Ali is a wonderful host. I…"
 January 2013,5,Riad Zyo,"This is a brand new hotel. It succeeds in combining European cleanliness and functionality with a Moroccan-themed interior. We found the hotel to have first rate European-style service like that of major hotel chains. The food on the hotel was first rate, worthy of a top-flight restaurant. The rooms were perfectly clean and the beds were wide. This was the only hotel in our two-week trip to Morocco where there was a real heading system. Not only was there an air-conditioner that could work in heating mode, there were also supplemental electric radiators, which were absolutely necessary, since we were traveling with a young child. The owner and the manager were highly-educated and spoke several languages, including English. Assuming they maintain this level, soon Hotel Zyo will…"
 December 2012,5,Riad Zyo in Rabat is an amazing place to stay,"Riad Zyo in Rabat is the most wonderful place we have ever stayed. It is a beautiful, brand new riad in the Rabat medina, designed and built by Dr Chraibi who has exquisite taste. The riad is gorgeous and the attention to detail is amazing, from the artistically sculpted lavender plants in the terrace garden, the fragrant orange blossoms perfuming the hotel, the original art, the modern furniture, the tasteful Moroccan details, to the fresh flowers and fruit in the rooms and the fountains around the pool in the courtyard. It is environmentally friendly with solar panels for heating and it is a paradise for any allergy sufferers as the decor is tastefully spare and spacious and immaculately clean. Dr. Chraibi and his staff are amazingly attentive, anticipating our every need.…"
 December 2012,5,"gem in the heart of the medina, old city","this road opened just recently and was designed by the owner/architect, Ali. It is exquisite and though it is very 'moroccan' it is more spare, elegant and zen with a fabulous attention to detail. (it does not have a lot of fabric, pillows everywhere so for those with allergies, this is excellent for that.) indoor courtyard opens to the sky from a lovely pool with spouting frogs and the host and staff are gracious and helpful in everyday. wood fireplace for colder evening communion and a rooftop garden beneath the stars. step outside this oasis of light and you are in the medina with all the bustle you could want though you'd never know it in the riad."
 December 2012,5,j´adore...,"We arrived to Rabat with no special expectation, just to spend the night here, and do some sight seeing.... but for our surprise, the city, has very nice places to visit... a beautiful port/marina... where you can eat with very nice views, also the Zoco its quiet and enjoyable to walk through... But most of all... we loved the Riad where we were staying, was the best surprise... It is done with the most exquisite taste in design, with beautiful art pieces and a peaceful and zen ambience. The owner is adorable, very cool man to have a pleasant talk with, he recommended us, few special places to visit, where to eat, etc... The breakfast was another delicious thing... i recommend it like a MUST of Rabat."
